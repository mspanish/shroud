The change does seem to have originated in Southern Germany, and apparently under Dominican influence,so the Shroud would have had to have been there 1290 1300 and associated with the Dominicans. There is just not a shred of evidence for this.” Correct – there is no evidence. One can only speculate. However, one may reasonably ask why this significant change in art history occurred. Of course, there could be several reasons. One might think The Black Death in the mid 1300s might have had something to do with it, but this doesn’t stack up given the artistic changes started occurring circa 1300. Personally, I think the changes were linked to the epitaphios, which started to appear around circa 1200 AD – 1300 AD and showed a more bloodied Christ than seen before. And that the epitaphios was influenced by the Shroud. I doubt the Shroud was in southern Germany in the the late 1200s, although it could have been. It’s worth reminding oneself of the geography of Europe around 1200 AD. I found the very good map below. It shows how close Hungary was to the Byzantine Empire. And it wasn’t far from Hungary to Southern Germany….The Danube acted as an important trade route in the middle ages, and connected southern Germany, through Hungary, and out to the Black Sea:.","date":"2014-11-17","mins":"2:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/a-scorch-is-a-scorch-of-course-of-course/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A scorch is a scorch, of course, of course,"},{"id":"comment-171665","author":"thomas","post":"Clearly Shroud devotion multiplied substantially from the 1500s.

Why would an artist create a shroud with the image on when there is no biblical reference to such an image? The conventional crude historic view (not mine) is that Jesus’s corpse resuscitated ie. Crudely speaking got up and walked out. There is no reference to him rising from the grave in an illuminated form (which by implication may have left a scorch)… although there are allusions in the gospels to His risen body not being the usual physical body. Is there historic art showing him in a glowing risen form, from the middle ages or before, that might justify such a depiction?

I’m not going to debate that matter any further. For me, it’s in the dust bin. As you also know, I am an authenticist – on the balance of historical and scientific evidence. However I acknowledge that the matter is not clear cut either way! And to that extent, I think you are definitely barking up the right tree in terms of a medieval creation theory, far more than any other present researcher. However, I still have a number of problems, including but not limited to: – If the Veil of Veronica was the defining influence, why create a whole body front and back image? I’m struggling with this one. The artisan could have just done a bas relief scorch of the face. The legend is unequivocal in terms of the image being one of the face rather than whole body – I know you are deferring from coming up with precise technological explanations for the image, but this is still a hole for me!!! – I know you and some others don’t have a problem with the nudity, I still do!!!! If the image was created for the express purpose of public display / worship, then it defies the norms of the time for no loin cloth! I realise there is the odd image here or there (maybe less than 5% of total images?) that shows a nude Christ, however as far as I am aware they were discrete, small images used in a private worship or ecclesiastical context, not images for wide public display or use!!! And never buttocks on full display (Even the nude images manage to subtly hide genitalia and / or buttocks). I stand to be corrected. Was the artisan and his supporters so sophisticated to promote the Shroud along the lines of: ‘We all know the loin cloth is a nonsense, and that Christ was wrapped in a shroud without also wearing a loin cloth!!” Assuming the apparent skill of the artisan in creating a bas relief or statue, then surely it would have not been difficult to craft a sculptural loin cloth? Fundamentally though, I don’t object to a contact imprint theory.

I seemed to observe that the image of the eyebrows appears stronger than the image of the forehead. This made me curious. Why would that be? I got experimenting, draping cloths over my head. The cloth would seem to fall just as heavily over the forehead as the eyebrows. If the variations in image intensity are due to distance from the cloth, as they seem to be, then this doesn’t make sense, as the cloth is touching both the eyebrows and forehead firmly…. On a typical person’s face eyebrows do not project far out. However, with a statue or bas relief, it would be natural to expect a slight raising of the eyebrow depiction, for effect. If the shroud was draped over a statue, then, the sculpted eyebrow feature projecting (as opposed to nearly flat on a real person) might explain slight lift away of the Shroud from the forehead.

Firstly, the nature of Jesus’s burial. It was a temporary burial brought on by circumstance. People were not usually buried in shrouds. Secondly, even if they were, we may simply not have any other shrouds with images because of the passage of time. Perhaps we have the shroud before us because it was preciously kept and guarded due its status in enshrouding Jesus..","date":"2015-11-13","mins":"11:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/13/nevertheless-the-images-are-real-enough/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nevertheless, the images are real enough!"},{"id":"comment-214592","author":"thomas","post":"Who cares about the shroud?

This would seem to be an argument in favour of the image being generated from a real human (dead) body.

The image was created by the miracle of the resurrection, a unique and utterly marvelous event, which is clearly not replicable. Many great and not so great minds have grappled with the issue over many years, and we seem as far away as ever from explaining it satisfactorily. I’m happy with leaving it to God’s mysterious work.

Would you concur that – at least theoretically – the image could also be explained by a miraculous contact process at resurrection? Because I still have a few problems with a medieval artisan theory, including: – “Sweat mimicking” – as far as I know the “sweat image” of history related to the face, not the whole body. – The buttocks! This still does not make sense to me in terms of medieval sensibility, with the VAST MAJORITY of historical imagery protecting Christ’s modesty with loin cloth. I realise there is the odd depiction of a fully nude Jesus, but a nude Jesus depicted in a manuscript (always with hands protecting modesty and no buttocks on display) is entirely different to a nude human size Jesus depicted for public showing!.","date":"2014-07-25","mins":"6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?
