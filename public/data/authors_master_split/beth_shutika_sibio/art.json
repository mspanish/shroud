[{"id":"comment-28820","author":"beth_shutika_sibio","post":"For anyone to dismiss the story of a child, I say to you this truth,”ALL CHILDREN WILL ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN BEFORE YOU WILL”. These words were spoken by CHRIST so why would anybody dismiss what any child CAN TEACH US. This is a great book and so is the Child’s version of this book. Another great book all here should read is called,”INTO THE LIGHT”. Also, if you have not seen it already there is a TV show that I saw and it was called,”DEATH AND BEYOND”. The show is narrated by Joel Osteen’s father “JOHN OSTEEN”. In 2008 my best friend died, in 2009 my dad died, in 2010 my granddad died, and in 2011 my WIFE died at the age of 40 and I have a 6 yr old son, he was 4 when she passed. In 2009 my mother overcame throat cancer, in 2012 my younger brother at age 44 had 3 minor heart attacks he now is on blood thinners and carries nitro. Now in 2013 my oldest brother 52 if fighting pancreatic and liver cancer and he has a 13yr old daughter and 9 yr old son. During this time I went through 4 hurricanes, moved 5 times, had our house struck by lightning causing 20k in damages. The one element in my life that grew even more powerful is my FAITH. My HOPE and BELIEF in JESUS CHRIST and that he is My Way, My Truth, and My Everlasting Life. Regardless of your own issues in LIFE DO NOT DENY JESUS CHRIST, yes we all will die that is a fact, but those who believe in CHRIST will RISE and live forever in HEAVEN..","date":"2013-03-30","mins":"6:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
