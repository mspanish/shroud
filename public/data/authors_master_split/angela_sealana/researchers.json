[{"id":"comment-190433","author":"angela_sealana","post":"Hi, Dan. Thanks for your continued efforts to promote the Shroud of Turin! I’ve admired your commitment to this blog over the years. As a staff member at the Pilgrim Center of Hope, I just wanted to clarify that the three endorsements by Bishops Flores, Gomez, and Garcia Siller shown on our brochure are endorsements for the mission of the Pilgrim Center of Hope. While Archbishop Garcia Siller continues to pray for and support our efforts, he has not given us a formal, written endorsement of this specific Visitor Center project. Also one more clarification: The traveling Shroud Exhibition which is currently in downtown San Antonio is not associated with the Pilgrim Center of Hope or our efforts to create a permanent Shroud of Turin Visitor Center in San Antonio, as may be inferred from your post “Crowd Funding a Twelve Foot Shroud of Turin Sign”. Our project has been in the works since 2010. :) Thanks again for your blog!.","date":"2015-02-09","mins":"3:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/05/four-million-dollar-home-for-shroud-expo-in-san-antonio/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Four Million Dollar Home for Shroud Expo in San Antonio"}]
