That fact that a prism split a light “beam” into various spectra was old news. However, that was a process at the quantum level of the object. So too was the two slit experiment, one the basic proofs of quantum mechanics preceded Plank’s definition of “quanta” by a century. Indeed, the phrase “quantum mechanics wasn’t adopted instantaneously when Planck first theorized the existence of quanta but a two decades later..

They have been analyzed down to the quantum level and determined to be real blood and an image that is not a painting BY SCIENCE. I was truly amazed by an earlier post by Charles Freeman that he hadn’t read Rogers book and couldn’t be bothered by Rogers work because it wasn’t Freeman’s field. As I have written, the study of the Shroud is multi disciplinary and any anyone who doesn’t take the time to study the multi disciplines involved is like a blind man trying to define an elephant. We should honor Freeman with the “Brass Tusk Award.” Can’t be ivory for obvious reasons and brass seems to fit Freeman to a tee..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"5:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210268","author":"john_klotz","post":"The devices used by the STURP team included those whose analysis depended on the properties of matter at the very basic level of existence. In Heller’s book he relates how they used a microspectrophotometer searching for a “soret band” of light spectrum of a tiny speck on the Shroud which would indicate blood. To me that’s down to the quantum level. We now have much more advanced tools which could be used including much sophisticated Multispectral Digital Imaging that was used on the Mona Lisa and to identify da Vinci as the artist who sketched a drawing of a young bride: La Bella Principessa. I am really jammed right now and I am ducking in and out so that’s as far as I can go for now. La Bella Principessa is discussed in Chapter 14 of my book the Coming of the Quantum Christ when I deal with the provenance of the Shroud. Quantum mechanics began with the discovery that light exhibited properties of both wave and matter in packets labeled quanta. Use of scientific analytical devices that depend on analyzing the spectrum of light of an object, in my view, is analysis down to the quantum level. It’s all about light. Then too, some theologians might say that’s what God is all about. “And the light shines in the darkness.” ..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"6:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210272","author":"john_klotz","post":"OK, I am not writing for a scientific academic audience. I am trying to reach out to a more general audience. My literary ideal is actually a lyricist, Stephen Sondheim who has the ability to express the most lyrical of sentiments in the “vernacular” so to speak. “Today, the world was just an address, a place for me to live in, no better than alright. But here you are, and what was just a world is a star. Tonight” His language moves from mundane to the most lyrical and romantic in a single phrase..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"}]
