Is it wrong to rely on science to either support or deny faith? There is an attitude that faith must stand independent of science and that those who attempt to harmonize faith and science are somehow lesser Christians. I guess I am guilty of this. For the better part of two millenia faith had demanded that we accept a story of the Garden of Eden and the forbidden fruit as the source the “original sin” which tained all of humanity. Had it not been for Adam and Eve there would have been no death and no work. We know know that that was a metaphor. Advanced theologians who were also scientists like Pierre teilhard de Chardin sought to redefine the faith in terms of evolution. The scientist who first proposed the “Big Bang” theory was a Belgium priest who was excoriated by the scientific community including some atheists. I think we are long past the moment when we should flee scientific proof of the authenticity of the Shroud. We do not organize our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. To say, I turn my back on science because my faith has no doubt is to limit your world and your faith. (That is not an accusation of you, Louis, it’s just something I read and hear from others.) By all the standards of evidence we use in law, the evidence that the Shroud is authentic is overwhelming except for the disputed carbon dating. The atheists cling to carbon dating the way some believers cling to their inerrant bible. Better, perhaps, to “Cling to that Old Rugged Cross.” Science is now approaching the complex question of human consciousness of self and its nature. The answer will lie in the Quantum realm, I believe. Genesis says that we are created in the image and likeness of God. That likeness is not our hands and our feet but our consciousness. I do not think this is heresy but it is my opinion or speculation in any event: Perhaps the best study of God is humanity..","date":"2013-04-16","mins":"10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/16/barrie-schwortz-would-like-to-see-reexamination-of-the-shroud-with-todays-technology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz would like to see reexamination of the Shroud with today’s technology"},{"id":"comment-31966","author":"john_klotz","post":"Dan, Your comment is, like our friends “across the pond” might state us “spot on.” If you are ever asked a question about the Shroud, the simplest, most direct answer is to refer them to this video.

Provenance refers to the origin and/or history of an object. One point that de Wesselow made his book the Sign was that in dealing with ancient works establishing the provenance meaning the origin and history is sometimes difficult, if not impossible. But let me use the Latin phrase “res ipsa loquitur” in context. The facts speak for themselves. In this case the facts are the physical existence of the Shroud and their attributes and what those physical attributes demonstrate. When one looks at the sum of those attributes it is pretty hard not to reach the conclusion that it is the burial cloth of a horribly tortured and crucified man. From the circumstances it’s reasonable to conclude that man was Jesus Christ. The only important fact on the other side of the ledger is the carbon dating. Ray Rogers and others showed why that may be wrong and Ray Rogers came up with a “fact” that pseudo skeptics seem to ignore. The complete absence of vanillin in the larges part of the Shroud indicating that it was at least 1500 years old, not 700 years. However, how many times impeached, the pseudo skeptics push the carbon dating button. I use the phrase “pseudo” skeptic, because they are not truly skeptics searching for truth. They are the truest believers, but their belief is atheism. Nothing that contradicts their view can be tolerated. So in one context, whatever you might say about the history of the Shroud is almost irrelevant. Who cares? Maybe Caligula used it as a shower curtain? Maybe Simon the Magician stole it because he could sell it for a mint and then somebody else stole it back. Maybe it was abducted by aliens in a UFO and then returned because it wasn’t worth much in the market place of Polaris’third planet. Maybe it was worshipped by the Knights Templar or the Knights of Malta. Maybe the Popes used it as a bed sheet. Who cares? The physical facts of what is here and now are what we can rely on. All the rest, to paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, is commentary. It’s provenance will always be in dispute for there can never be an conclusive path proven from the Tomb to Turin. But what fascinates me is its providence. The image on the Shroud while interesting and inspiring through medieval time to the present age of science could have taught very little until the advances of science in the past 115 years. And now, in this skeptical era science has caught up with the Shroud. The scientific study of the Shroud has become a revelation, rather a Revelation. Is it coincidental? Or was the image left there for discovery now? Is the issue provenance. Or providence? Is it an accident, or the product of a consciousness beyond our understanding? Does it matter which is true (or both)..","date":"2012-05-31","mins":"9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/31/comment-promoted-ray-schneider-on-charles-freeman-sturp/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Comment Promoted: Ray Schneider on Charles Freeman & STURP"},{"id":"comment-146767","author":"john_klotz","post":"Dan, I believe that based upon Colin’s long winded threat, you should rally reconsider whether Colin is an appropriate contributor to blog comment section.

In Quantum Christ I quoted Sir Roger Penrose (Nobel Laureate) and Dr. Stuart Hameroff: “Consciousness implies awareness: subjective experience of internal and external phenomenal worlds. Consciousness is central also to understanding, meaning and volitional choice with the experience of free will. Our views of reality, of the universe, of ourselves depend on consciousness. Consciousness defines our existence.” (Emphasis added) Teilhard de Chardin defines the human species as the singular species which has a reflective consciousness. Not just that we are aware of our existence but that we are aware that we are aware. Sir Bertrand Russell was wrote that solipsism – the belief that the only relevant existence is that we consciously perceive and thus create – is the only defensible philosophy. There is a legendary anecdote that has been reported in different guises that a woman wrote him to express her gratitude for his enunciating his position because “I thought I was the only one ho believed that.” Solipsism is my opinion is the underlying explanation for Ayn Rand’s Egoism and Friedrich Nietzsche’s nihilism. I fled from it. In my book “Quantum Christ” I defined God as the primordial consciousness from which our existence sprang. I do not retreat from the definition but now I think I can clarify it further: God is the primordial solipsist. He is the big box of consciousness into which all the little boxes of consciousness are contained and that includes each of us. Some years ago I read that quantum science was demonstrating that underlying our existence was the law of probability theory. Incidentally, Richard Dawkins agrees with that. I was aghast and so was Einstein before he died. But I asked myself a question: Whose law is the law of probability? I think I am challenged now to write this more explicitly. Maybe I am being challenged by that great solipsist in the sky to do it? Perhaps, I should get a grip. Your use of ancient numerology is difficult to accept carte blanche.

Yet what makes the post so important is his marshalling of many of the circumstances of the crucifixion exhibited on the Shroud that would be beyond the competence or knowledge of a medieval forger or any forger without extensive historical, medical, biological, horticultural and scientific knowledge unknown until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is an exhibition of circumstantial evidence that is not only compelling, but in my viewpoint conclusive as to the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin as burial cloth of Jesus Christ. Part of his posting contains the listing of 28 items exhibited by the Shroud that are clearly “circumstances” of the Shroud pointing to its authenticity. You may quibble (as I do) about some of the circumstances and their implication but unless you can defeat all 28 circumstances you are left with the conclusion that an important body of circumstantial evidence that supports authenticity. How many” 24?, 20?, 10?, 5?, 3? How many circumstances must a prosecutor prove that someone is guilty of murder once you have the body of a dead person killed by a gunshot.?

It may be a thesis of that explains the “Kirlian aura” effect as a cause of the image. “An alternative but perhaps less likely theory is that the imprint resulted from a “Kirlian effect” or other unknown quality of Christ’s body; the aura of light and the rare condition of haematidrosis (bloody sweat) recorded of Christ may be cited in this regard.aura” William Meacham, http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm.

The importance of the image is not the process of its creation which may not be “miraculous” as that term is normally used. It is what the image displays or doesn’t display. It doesn’t display evidence of putrefaction byproducts and does display evidence of rigor mortis. The two are related. Rigor mortis is a freezing of the muscles into their configuration at the time of death or a short time afterwards. Putrefaction is a degeneration of body tissues and is evidenced by the exuding of chemicals that would be obviously present on a shroud and lead to pronounced degradation of a shroud. Although times for each may very, it is not a leap of logic to assume they are related. 48 hours in the normal course is reasonable time to expect thee onset of putrefaction and the release of rigor mortis. Let see. 48 hours from 3:00pm on a Friday is 3:00 PM on the following Sunday afternoon. If a body had remained enwrapped in the Shroud of Turin until 3:00 PM Sunday and the image created at that time or later there would be in all probability no evidence of rigor mortis and some evidence of putrefaction. Numerous examinations of the Shroud image by expert forensic pathologists have found neither evidence of putrefaction nor the release of rigor mortis.

It seems to me that some individuals are too comfortable with a science faith dichotomy that they too easily reject the intrusion of one or another into the world view. Thus the Resurrection is an event not subject to scientific investigation and analysis because it can’t be repeated. Almost every one on either side of the science faith dichotomy recognizes now that the universe as we know it began with a “big bang.” Yet, it is not a repeatable event and our understanding of it is more an application of mathematics to physical observations. [If any one knows a scientist trying to replicate the Big Bang, please ask him to stop.] Now!!! Just as the creation of the universe was once a matter of faith and is now a matter of science even though we can’t repeat it, I would suggest that there are aspects of the Resurrection “theory” are examinable by scientific theory. It begins with a form of matter (a body) that is transformed into something we do not yet have an explanation of other than through faith. But that transformation happened in the here and now and everything up to the moment of transformation is subject to scientific and historical analysis. This of course brings us to the Shroud of Turin and its image which I believe gives circumstantial support to the Resurrection in that it was created before rigor mortis was released on the body and byproducts of putrefaction existed that would degrade the cloth. There is no question I believe that means that the body and the Shroud parted company. Circumstantially, the Resurrection is consistent with Shroud and the Shroud is inconsistent with almost any other hypothesis. I applaud the efforts of scientists like Jackson and his colleagues who are seeking an explanation of how the image was created. That the theories advance involve “natural” phenomena doesn’t detract one whit from the “miracle” that was the Resurrection just as the hypothesis of the Big Bang detracts from faith that at the core of our existence was a primordial consciousness from which our existence evolved.

He claimed that it would take an enormous amount of “contamination” to have skewed the C 14 results. The problem is that the critics of the C 14 tests address was not “contamination” but the presence of a rewoven linen and repairs. Contamination might an appropriate description of the bio plastic coating theory but it simply does not apply to the work of Ray Rogers and virtually every other commentator since the landmark Benford Marino report of 2000. Rogers found THAT THE LINEN in the are was NEW because of substantial differences with the linen in the body of the Shroud. Also, it was dyed UNLIKE the linen in the main body of the Shroud. The cotton was present because the linen didn’t hold the dye and the cotton is what gave the patch color. Apparently Jackson had stepped out for coffee when Pam Moon of GB earlier gave an excellent presentation on new examinations of pictures of the underside of the Oxford sample that pretty conclusively demonstrated dramatic differences with the main body of the Shroud. What Jackson and the company want to do is throw the dice on a theory that will “prove” the Resurrection. There theory may even be correct. But to move that theory forward in a desperate attempt to “prove” the Resurrection is a fools errand. Perhaps I am being impolitic. But the search for truth is often impolitic. Frankly, Sunday morning’s highlight was the clash between Jack Markwardt and Dan Scavone about the early history of the Shroud. In case anyone wasn’t listening, Professor Scavone’s presentation which followed Markwardt’s had one item that seemed to verify Markwardt’s basic point: that an inventory of the Constantinople relics before 1204 listed two different relics: a Sudarium and a Sindone. That in no way is a critique of Professor Scavone who has been a lion in the study of Shroud history. The “debate” between Markwardt and Scavone is an honest one and mutually respectful.

You see the issue is circumstantial evidence and even the atheist Pope, Richard Dawkins, understands the necessity of relying on circumstantial evidence when dealing with ancient artifacts. I even blogged a piece in June 2011 which demonstrated its use and related it to the Shroud of Turin: THE SHROUD OF TURIN, THE RESURRECTION AND JOE KENNEDY, http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2011/06/shroud of turin resurrection and joe.html It is more or less the heart of the first chapter of my book which deals with how we can reasonable draw conclusions from circumstantial evidence and as Dawkins notes we sometimes have to. In sum, from two facts recited in the third verse of the lyrics written by Ira Gershwin, reasonable conclude, and I would submit beyond a reasonable doubt, that Gershwin was twitting Joseph Kennedy, the father of US President John Kennedy. The two facts: (a) in 1929 I sold short and in (b) In England I am presented in Court. Cutting to chase, I submit with 100% confidence that of tyhe over 100 billion huamns who have walked the face of the Earth since the human race emrged from evolution, nly one – Joseph P. Kennedy fits those two facts. I guess the odds that he is not would be 1 in a 100,000,000,000. Obviously, the issue of Shroud authenticity is a much more complex issue. However, its an accumulation of facts, that lead inevitability to the conclusion that the Shroud is authentic. Some are quite strong and some are more weak. You can not reach a conclusion without taking into account the totality of the evidence. It’s something that we do every day of our life. To quote the first sentence of my book: “We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” In a UN debate back in the day, the USSR Ambassador twitted the UN Ambassador for retitevly quoting himself. And Goldberg hadn’t even written a book to quote from. : ) There is a paper on the shroud.com which lists many of the circumstances which revealed by the physical facts of the Shroud: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/doclist.pdf It lists 87 circumstances that the signers of the paper believed support the authenticity of the Shroud which were empircally proven and 61 more confirmed findings that point in that direction.

Once again, Charles Freeman has failed to give us one concrete example of a linen Shroud that preexisted the Shroud of Turin after writing of inventories listing shrouds.

Why should the Shroud have uniquely survived? The answer would seem to be it survived because it is very special. It’s uniqueness in that regard is in essence an argument for its authenticity. It is very, very special and unique. Charles had spoken of inventories listing shrouds. What inventories and when were they gathered? There is another aphorism that I know is not just American.

The first sentence of my book is “We do not order our lives by proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Nonetheless we do make decisions. I have spent my professional career dealing with proving and disproving things. When I graduated law school, I won an award for the best contribution by a senior student to the law review. It was a note on the evidentiary principle of res ipsa loquitur: the facts speak for themselves. My principal point was that res ipsa was simply an application of the rules of circumstantial evidence. I appreciate the fact that it would be a bit of arrogance (if not simony) for me to insist that you buy by book. So here’s a freebee. The arguments about authenticity drawn from my book in the guise of a review of the CNN production of CNN’s Funding Jesus is available on the web at no cost at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/klotzcnn.pdf (I do not know if that TV program was available across the pond). Excuse my self absorption if I cite that piece as “Klotz”). I will now give you a lecture (I’m not nearly as arrogant as I write) on the Shroud and circumstantial evidence citing four physical objects three of which are in physical existence today and one of which we have available only through a painting of it. The three which physically exist to day are (1) the Shroud of Turin; (Klotz p. 4), (2) The Pray Codex in Budapest Hungary. (Klotz p. 5) and (3) an illustration in the prayer book of Margaret of France (Klotz p. 3). The one which is not in existence but of which we have a painting is the Lier Shroud. (Klotz p. 5). There is no question that three of them are artistic representations and one of them is NOT an artistic representation but actually has burn holes surrounded by a charred ring. (See illustration Klotz P. 4) It should be no surprise that the one with actual burn holes is the Shroud of Turin. Two things of interest about the Lier Shroud. It was created before the fire in 1532 and does not therefore evidence the patches sewn on by the Poor Sister of St. Clare. Neither does the Pray Codex. Here’s the kicker in my view, the painting of the Lier Shroud shows the degrading of the burn holes from layer to layer. Neither the Pray Codex NOR Margaret’s prayer book has that verisimilitude. I believe it was Colin Berry who refereed to the Pray Codex as “over hyped.” I do not know what that means scientifically. It is what it is. Those who wish to denigrate it with elegant invective conveniently ignore the facts. In the upper left hand corner of the drawing is a figure with a cloth draped over his shoulder. It’s actually two illustrations. The top part is the burial of Jesus and it shows, inter alia, Joseph of Arimethea. The bottom part is an Angel announcing the Resurrection to the Mary Magdalene and the women who accompanied her. The important point is the consistency of the burn hole configuration among all four items: the original Shroud and the three representations with the Lier Shroud actually showing variations of the holes through four layers. The conclusion to be reached by this circumstantial evidence is I believe unassailable and actually reaches proof beyond reasonable doubt standards. The Shroud predates the time period allowed by the carbon dating.

That science has revealed to us the meaning of the blood stains and the image at this pint in human history, is also … providential. We are literally facing the possible, if not inevitable, apocalyptic extinction of the humanity. The engine of our extinction is the selfish abuse of the environment empowered by advances in science. Our survival now depends on extraordinary, unprecedented and perhaps impossible acts of individual and collective selflessness. Science whose inventions have brought us to the brink of extinction can, if properly harnessed, give us the tools to pull us back. What the Shroud teaches by example the power of love to conquer selfishness and death in even the most dire circumstances. Because the evolution that drove the development of our reflective consciousness was driven by selfishness it may very well have been necessary that God his/herself had to give the example of selfless love through the death and resurrection of Christ. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. No simple human could have given the necessary example. The real miracle and revelation is that Christ partakes of our human nature. One of the jotys of my life is to hear on Christmas eve a line of from O Holy night that may sum up the mystery and revelation of Christ for us all: “Long lay the world in sin and error pining; till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.” In an E Mail today, John Jerpe had the following insight: “[T]he present state of the world is such that habitual warfare and weaponized technology increase the probability of something apocalyptic. If we already know that the human community might “self destruct”, perhaps the Shroud (and the Man in it) are saying that there exists dormant within the human organism an energy source we have not even conceptualized yet, hence the image. I.e. Is the Man in the Shroud simply Jesus or is the man in the Shroud you and I?” The Shroud matters not because Christ was God, it matters becasue it testifies and reveals that he was also human – just as you and I..","date":"2015-05-21","mins":"10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/21/john-klotz-the-blind-men-the-elephant-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"John Klotz, the Blind men, the Elephant and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-199941","author":"john_klotz","post":"Fascinating story Louis.

If our consciousness is a quantum phenomenon can they not become entangled with other phenomenon. Is that not description of love?

Morstyn R. Abstract Most psychodynamic theories are based on Freud’s models of mental dynamics which were significantly influenced by Newtonian physics. Freud’s attempts to use the then current scientific metaphors led to theoretical and clinical dilemmas particularly in deep psychotherapy and especially with borderline patients. The author argues that as Newtonian principles are useful for describing macroscopic reality, so Freud’s Newtonian constructs are useful to a certain depth of therapy.

Quantum metaphors are used to explore duality, free will and patient therapist interaction.

In Heller’s book after he and Adler had reached a conclusion based on upon their investigation,using a microspectrophotometer for which they had to go through two colleagues to arrange a test. The results indicated old acid methemoglobin an clear indicia of old, ancient blood. As qualified as they were, they each consulted with another expert.

Whatever Colin’s credentials, and they may be impressive in his field, he is apparently using makeshift apparatus. Does he actually work in his kitchen? I thought I saw that once. John Brown worked in his dinning room, but he had one his advanced microscopes there. Ray Rogers did not rely on his expertise and devices which far exceed what Colin has at his disposal. Moreover, he didn’t rely on his own findings and sought verification from others including John Brown and Robert Villarreal. Brown was a retired Principal Research Scientist at Georgia Tech Research Institute who had his own Scanning Electronic Microscope at his home. He reproduced pictures of fibers from the Raes patch at 3650 X and 3300 X magnification. You can look at them yourself, at this very instant. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf Robert(o) Villarreal reported on his results twice: once at the 2008 Ohio Conference http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm and again at the 2012 Valencia Conference http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf Villarreal was consulted by Rogers shortly before he died and he was given a sample thread by Rogers. But before he could any test Rogers passed away. He asked Roger’s wife Joan what he should do and she said she was too distraught to deal with it. He heard nothing more until contacted by Barrie Schwortz who was de facto Rogers’ scientific executor. Barrie delivered to Villarreal, among other things, a sample thread from the carbon sample area which held back by Riggi and Gonella. The thread samples Virreal then had were examined by: 1. X ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy 2. Tube Excited and Radioactive Source Micro spot Energy Dispersive X Ray Fluorescence (MXRF) Spectrometry 3. High and Low Powered Magnification with a High Resolution Photo Microscope 4. Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) with Reflectance Mode Capability 5. Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (TOF SIMS) In each one of those tests he was assisted by scientists from Los Alamos, Berry says “forget STURP, forget Rogers” on no other basis then his skepticism. He has never had in his possession a sample of any kind from the actual Shroud as Rogers, Brown, Villarreal and Schwortz did. People like to cite Occam’s Razor for various propositions, none of which actually originated with William of Okkam. Let me put it this way. Fraud and Falsehood are usually more complex than the truth. Unless you have grounds to believe that Ray Rogers, Sue Benford, Joe Marino, John Brown,. Robert Villarreal and Barrie Schwortz were participating in a fraud that scanned 14 years (from Orvieto to Valencia) you have no basis to ignore their results as Berry does. Frankly, I am reminded of Christ’s retort to Mary and Joseph when as a boy, he had abandoned them to discuss scripture with the elders of the Temple: “Do you not know I must be about my father’s business.” His Father is also our Father. In studying the shroud, we are about His business. We can not, as I am once again, allow Berry to distract us from His business with a whistling tea pot. There is too much real science to do.

However, I have commented enough on Freeman. My statement on Mc Crone is a value judgment in the course of a debate. The fact that the Shroud is not a painting is well supported by peer reviewed scientific research. NO PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED OTHERWISE. On the other hand, I would never call you ” evil, insincere, deceitful,etc,” I have no doubt about your sincerity. I do believe your appraisal of Mc Crone is simply wrong and I am at loss to find substantiation for it other than the rhetoric of individuals who are desperate to prove the Shroud unauthentic. In both Saxe’s books and Gove’s it finally comes to Mc Crone. Our argument is over his good faith. He didn’t have any. That’s my opinion. It’s also my opinion that given the extent and depth of research into the painting issue which began before STURP was just a gleam in John Jackson’s eye, the overwhelming, uncontradicted by peer reviewed scientific evidence, is that the Shroud is not a painting. There comes a time when after weighing the evidence we ought to make a decision. “We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt”.

Your statement which is of course libelous per se on this side of the Atlantic had you named just one living person who was “evil, insincere, deceitful,etc” Such a personal attack is totally unwarranted by any facts you have stated. One thing I have stated about Heller is that he had “soul.” In an inner US city, that is the highest of praise. I guess I’m a little partial to the term since at one time in my career, I was representing Latino insurgents against the corrupt Bronx political machine in the South Bronx. After one argument in court, an African American Council member who was also a minister remarked to an acquaintance: “I never knew Klotz had soul.” I have had a number of compliments in my career but I was touched by that one. Of course primo uno compliment came from the presiding judge of the New York State Court who introduced to me to “his attorney” as “one the ten best lawyers in Manhattan.” That was probably hyperbole, but the my “soul” compliment about Heller is a measure of my esteem for the late John Heller. If you have truly read Heller’s book, and not come away with personal admiration, if not for his book than the man, you are surely in sorry state. I am spent too much time on this blog this weekend. It’s been a distraction. However when I come to appropriate time to write a about pseudo skeptics in my book, this interchange will play a role.

Whatever your infatuation with Walter Mc Crone, for years he used is “debunking” of the Yale Vinland map as a credential. It was one of the things that impressed STURP members early on. Gove in his memoir after discussing the Shroud with Mc Crone in 1977 78, concluded he was seeking to polish his credentials withe proving the Shroud a fake. You may may feel John Heller an unreliable witness or scientist, you sight one individual and rush to the 1973 test which Heller found to be unreliable. I believe Heller to be a very credible scientist. Gove’s dish of Heller in his memoir would be laighable if it were not, I will use the word “dishonest.” Also, the earliest work on the Shroud by STURP scientists before there was even a formal STURP revealed a lack of “directionality ” in the image. Also the image is finer than any known paint brush (cf Heller again). Mc Crone frantically came up with various theories and theories about it being a painting, but none of them flew. And eventually his findings on the Vinand map were challenged. Here’s were you have an near insurmountable problem: the Shroud is not a work of art. As far as the Byzantine is concerned (depending on how you define Byzantine, Paul Vidnon who was among the first scientific scholars to report on the Pia photos also rejected it as a work of art. Vignon was also an accomplished artist. Later, he published a book at the start of of World War II that examined in great detail the relationship of the image of the Shroud to what I assume you mean by Byzantine. Vignon’s book was an elaborate expensive production and was never translated into English. I was privileged to examine a copy at the NY Public Library., two years ago. However Vignon’s work was first noticed by Walsh and then popularized by Ian Wilson and his examination of the Vignon markings has been quite sophisticated. Not all the markings are representive in each piece of Byzantine art and some are included and some not in various places. About the history of art you might have something to contribute. However, with all due respect, you have a habit of trashing those who reach conclusions different than yours. I.e. Thomas de Wesellow. For some reason you review of his book “The Sign” had disappeared from the Amazon page on the The Sign. Am I correct on that? My last attempt to find it was unsuccessful. Perhaps I didn’t go deep enough. If you can as an art historian identify the school or tradition from which the Shroud image might have come, it might be helpful. In From Christ to Coke, Martin Kemp attempted to do a cursory examination and I would submit failed miserably. But that’s my opinion and I shall address it later. Kemp, when not being cursory, is in fact an excellent art historian and his work as an appraiser can involve some deep science. No so in the case of his Shroud appraisal. I will write about that in my manuscript. Now I have to get to court.

However, I have one reservation about blood. Not that new work is needed but that blood hasn’t been demonstrated. There is nothing you’ve said but you seem to ignore or overlook the conclusions of Heller and Adler which were published in a peer reviewed journal. . When I first started the path, someone whose initials are in fact BS suggested I should read John Heller’s Report on the Shroud of Turin. It is the most authoritative work on STURP written and Heller was a gifted writer. He was not at the 120 hours of Turin but he became a part of STURP a two months before they departed for Rome and in the ensuing three years labored mightily to resolve the issues of the the blood stains He did the blood work on the samples Rogers took that were temporarily absconded by Walter Mc Crone. Adler was brought into STURP by Heller. Heller, as I have mentioned from time to time was a Yale graduate who in his undergraduate days was chosen by Yale to be advised by Einstein at Princeton. He tries to modestly brush it off as a fluke bit it was hardly that. The best summation of STURP and what it did and frankly a measure of Heller’s soul is what I quote at length and call his Valedictory: “The images are the result of dehydrative acid oxidation of the linen. The blood is human blood. How the images got on the cloth is a mystery. We would love to have the answer to this mystery, to explain the science of .it. If it turns out that some form of molecular transport we have not been able to fathom is a method whereby the images of the scourge, crucified man were transferred to the linen, we shall have solved only another little micro part of the puzzle. “We do know, however, that there are thousands upon thousands of pieces of funerary linen going back two millennia before Christ and another huge number of linens of Coptic Christian burials. On none of these is there any image of any kind. A few have some blood and stains on them, but no image. “However, there are some remarkable aspects to this voyage of discovery. The team itself – its formation, cohesion, diversity, collaboration, as well as his sacrifice of time, talent and treasure – is unique in scientific annals. “The role of “coincidence” is awesome. “Science undertook its specialty, which is measurement. We were supremely confident that the answers would – indeed must – be forthcoming. And we fail. “Many team members were ordered or threatened to desist from the project, yet they persevere. Though it was believed that there would be a confrontation between science and religion, none occurred. Rather the relationship was harmonious and synergistic. “All of us have been changed by the project. I believe we have grown. “Some years ago, a friend of mine said to me in exasperation, ‘Heller, why don’t you spend less time in Athens and more in Jerusalem?’ “I find the Acropolis much less interesting these days.” Dr. John H.

He didn’t do that. He sent him three slides and kept the rest. Jackson and Rogers had to go to Chicago and physically retrieve them. He also was sloppy in his handling. The most appropriate critique of Heller’s work might be that Mc Crone had messed up the samples – except that Heller and Adler were able to work around that klutz Mc Crone’s mess. : ) And incidentally, in Grove’s memoir he indicates that Mc Crone was out to prove the Shroud a fake from the get go.

He devised an earth centric solar system and to make it work all he had to do was hypothesize a little loop in each of the planets’ orbits around the earth. Scientists who seek to explain away consciousness are engaged in their own Ptolemaic exercise. We don’t know all the answers yet, but it’s Teilhard’s explanation of reflective consciousness comes to mind: It isn’t just to know that we exist but it is to know that we know. (I hope I got that right.

John wrote: “God is love.” I believe in the reality of that in some ways that might seem both arcane and hyper modern. It’s a quantum thing. Christ gave us two commandments taken from scripture but combined in a unique way. They were to love God with our whole being and to love our neighbor as ourselves. That’s it. But what does it mean to love both God and neighbor? How does one “love” a disembodied spirit existing before space and time and beyond our comprehension. Christ nswered that question in the parable of the Last Judgment. [So described by Pope Benedict and Pope Francis]. When one reads the litany of deeds that enable salvation, there are some things lacking. No where is tithing raised as a necessary deed, nor even honoring the Sabbath. Rather only through the works of love to the neediest CAN we express our love of the deity. Pope Francis realizes this. That’s why he saw Jesus in the person of a young Moslem delinquent girl whose feet he washed during his first Holy Week as pope. Mother Theresa found Christ in the desperate neediest in the slums of Calcutta. It a real test to love the neediest, particularly if he or she is a homeless person on the subway who hasn’t bathed in a while and who, frankly, smells awful. But that’s what Christianity is about. At least that’s what Christ said Christianity is about. Three little words, twelve letters: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.","date":"2014-04-25","mins":"10:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones"},{"id":"comment-28158","author":"john_klotz","post":"Congratulations Steve on another, clear, clean presentation of irrefutable facts that are (1) indisputable scientifically and (2) totally irreconcilable with the Shroud as forgery.

It’s the pseudo skeptics, that must deny them. They do so because in the very fine details of the Shroud are facts that are simply incompatible with their world view. We can have a real debate when the self styled champions of “science” accept the scientifically established reality of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

In terms of serious study, I may have come late to the dance. But I view this controversy has an attorney and a political and environmental activist (and former Vice Chair of the NYS New Democratic Coalition when there was an NDC). That means I sometimes find myself in coalition with individuals who have different world views than mine, sometimes very profoundly different views (i.e. Really old Left). My politics come from a dissertation by a man named Matthew which is a part of the book called the New Testament. Yet, even with people I may profoundly disagree with, I have made common cause on issues we agree on: Merit selection of judges, not invading Iraq, women’s rights, nuclear disarmament. Those are some examples. I hope I haven’t totally lost you with the list. To my analysis there are two issues with the Shroud and they both are extremely important. Ultimately they are far more important for the human condition than any of the others I have worked on or written about, and possibly, you and I would have disagreement. But I am sure you agree with me on these two: The Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ and that it offers some proof of his Resurrection. There is another recent book touching on the Shroud by an art historian (this time an Oxonian) Martin Kemp: “From Christ to Coke.” In it Kemp recognized the power of the Christ icon and notes the strange transformation that occurred circa 300 CE when in changed from curly haired Roman or Greek to the Pantocrator. He then disses Ian Wilson’s Edessa theory and opines that the Shroud was the work of a medieval artist from Northern Italy or France. It’s “balderdash,” (That’s a nice anglo saxon insult. I also like poppycock). I haven’t read the book yet but pre ordered the Kindle from Amazon which won’t be available until next week on this side of the pond. But the fact that an English academic (of sorts, listen to his credentials closely on the U Tube) dismisses the carbon dating in a well publicized book is no small thing for us. “Politically” our task is to bring to the attention of world opinion that the carbon dating was “tommy rot.” That’s half of the task. As to the second half, the claim that the Resurrection was a mirage created by the Shroud, we can deal with that because it ranks up there with da Vinci did it with his Leica camera obscura. : ) I haven’t seen the whole book, but I’ll take the half that deflates the carbon dating and say “thank you.”.","date":"2012-03-28","mins":"7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/28/quote-for-today-stephen-e-jones-on-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","title":"Quote for Today: Stephen E.

The two are related: the process of putrefaction releases rigor mortis. What this means is that image was probably created with 48 hours of the death of the man in the image; before 3:00 pm, Sunday. If you go to Shroud.com and search for the word “pathologist” it will generate 102 hits. Among the most thorough are the reports of Dr. Robert Bucklin.

Ray Rogers has estimated that even by a mallard reaction, the image must have been formed in a minute fraction of a second. Yes, the Shroud image is “functional equivalent” of photograph but it is not a photograph. Photographs do not exhibit the differences in image intensity directly related to distance that the Shroud does. To me that would seem to destroy the concept of an imprint by contact.
