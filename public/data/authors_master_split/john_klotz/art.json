It is a factual circumstance that supports authenticity. Any single item of circumstantial evidence rarely “proves” anything. The issue is whether it is consistent with one side of the matter at issue because if its inconsistent it start to point in the opposite direction. It is an accumulation of circumstances that point in the same direction that eventually proves the case.. The nudity of Christ in the Shroud image is consistent with the fact of his burial after a nude crucifixion. All that en wrapped were the burial linens. Now how many images of a nude Christ on the cross are there? Is the answer one? or two or even ten? How many original images of Christ with his genitals with a loin cloth. I would hazard a guess that there may be significantly more than 100,000. Now how many reproductions of loin cloth covered genital area are there? There are more than two billion Christians living to day.Counting Rosary reproductions, , sacred icons and even cheesy reproductions of the crucifixion,over the span of nearly two millennia I would suggest there are tens of million if bnot hundreds of millions. The odds that the naked Christ of the Shroud is not unique and attributal to its authenticity claim probably run to at least 100,000 to 1 or .00001. . I sometimes find that “true believers” fight the use of reasonable inferences from the evidence because they insist that it be a matter of faith. (That’s not you Louis) The merger of science and religion is proceeding apace. Some Catholic theologians are way ahead of the crowd in recognizing the Chardian confluence of Science and Religion.

It is indeed a work of art drawn from the Shroud and expresses the agony and suffering of the Man in the Shroud. A small forensic note: the statute demonstrates that the Man in the Shroud was in a state of rigor mortis (knees bent at time of death). That means that it is likely that the image was transferred to the Shroud within 48 hours of his death. Let’s see, under normal circumstances rigor mortis would have been released by 3:00 pm the Sunday after the Friday execution. That’s sometime after the accounts of Mary Magdalene’s discovery of the missing body at day break Sunday morning.

Are you saying that ISIS demands “global reconversion” to Islam or is it that reconversion to Christianity is necessary. I might ask “Which Christianity?” Christianity comes in many different flavors. To claim that there was once a global Christianity ignores much of Asia including of course China as well as sub Saharan Africa. On the other hand, the truly reformist and ecumenical spirit of Pope Francis embracing all who love whatever their particular religious flavor may very well be a wave of the future of the Church and Christianity. Christ may appear in many different guises for He is, after all, “only” Love. This is of particular relevance to me right now because last week my wife and I saw a revival of the “King and I.” I’ll spare you all my critique but one the most impressive parts of revival was a complex ballet based upon Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

However, specious arguments from pseudo skeptics, self described as scientists, really don’t provide much enlightenment. I won a gold medal for science in high school. That does not make me a scientist. Neither did the fact that one of my instructors may have had a teaching certificate for science make him a scientist. Joe Nickel’s white lab coat and microscope do not make him a scientist, neither does his degree in journalism. However, I do have a lifetime of experience is evaluating evidence and arguments seeking to determine the truth. I do think that some of the self described scientists could enlighten us with say a listing of their peer reviewed published articles and their degrees. On the other hand, Colin Barry is someone with some scientific credentials and a legitimate claim to being a scientist. That doesn’t make his claim that this Image of the Shroud of Turin is Jacques De Molay other than nonsense. I have spent more than five decades reading the science pages of the New York Times on a daily basis. I have on occasion subscribe to Scientific America. I remember at first being a little discombobulated when I read several decades ago that the basis of all existence was actually an exercise in the law of probabilities. I was somewhat mollified when I asked myself: Who’s law is the law of probabilities? Bottom line is this: spare us the claim of superior knowledge of a “scientist.” Just give us facts and we will make our own judgment’s. In my considered opinion, weighing all the facts and evidence, the shroud of Turin is authentic and is consistent with the Resurrection. Other then your unsupported disbelief, if you have a contrary view, just the facts please.

The event horizon is the place beyond which observation can not be made but at the horizon there is very much to observe. Observation of the horizon is one way we know the black hole exists, For example, let’s take either dawn or sunset. Before the sun rises we know its coming because the horizon lights up. At dusk, the sun disappears but the horizon remains visible and we know the sun was there. It’s not a perfect analogy by far, but its observation of the effects of a black hole that tells us it’s there. That observation disappears at a point. It’s where it’s the point where the visual effects can no longer be observed that we reach an event horizon. It is not that there is no light in the black hole, it is that light can not escape the gravity of the black hole. As I wrote on my blog concerning the death of my son Michael that death is the ultimate event horizon. See my original comment: http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2007 10 01 archive.html where I used “event horizon” as a metaphor for death and a second comment where I expand the thought because of the work of Stuart Hammeroff. Http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2012 08 01 archive.html I have an disagreement with some who do not believe that the Resurrection is discoverable. If a physical body processed to something else then it should not be surprising that there are artifacts of the body or the process that were left behind, The image on the Shroud may be an artifact of the Resurrection. It is not the glorified body of St. Paul but rather it is the body as the last moment it could be seen. Because we can not see beyond that artifact, it is in at least in metaphorical or symbolical sense an “event horizon.” Then again, as we used to sing in the heady days of Vatican II, “love makes symbols real.”.","date":"2013-10-13","mins":"10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-case-you-missed-isabel-piczeks-wonderful-paper/","cat":"art","title":"In case you missed Isabel Piczek’s wonderful paper"},{"id":"comment-129941","author":"john_klotz","post":"Colin, It amazing how chaotic the world has become that it is almost impossible to simply ascribe labels to individuals. I think you should note that the label I ascribed to you is “scientist.” That was not written by me as “irony” but as recognition of a fact. As far as Jacques de Molay is concerned, I think like Leonardo there is more than one de Molay. There is an historical individual named de Molay and there are all the de Molays of myth. To posit de Molay as the figure on the Lirey badge is to honor a de Molay of myth. I expect that the real de Molay was neither the evil, devil worshipping charicature drawn by King Philip and his henchman nor the secular saint honored by the Masons. I do not think finding the real de Molay is possible. Leonardo was a very complex individual of great genius. There may very well be secrets of himself that he kept. However, was he the champion of an underground stream of heresy and conspiracy? Frankly, I doubt it extends as far as the Leonardo of either Holy Blood, Holy Grail or the da Vinci Code. One I’ve read and one I haven’t. There are mysteries that demand resolution because of their importance. Deciphering Christ is important to this day. I am not sure that decoding da Vinci or de Molay rises to that level of importance. The one I read claims to be history. As some of those who I confide in are aware, I am struggling with an issue of supreme importance to to me and I think posterity. We are deep into what I refer to as to “Apocalypse of Selfishness.” The sixth mass extinction of species is underway. One species extinguished may be us. It just so happens that suddenly on the world stage there appears a personalty who may very well be the one most important voice in leading humanity away from the brink of extinction. He happens to be that most despised of creatures in the view of some de Molay adherents: a Roman Catholic pope. We are a long way from King Philip and de Molay and the Borgias. We are not along way from He who was martyred by selfishness for the answer to the problems we face begin with an extraordinary exercise of selflessness epitomized by Him and recorded on the Shroud of Turin. We have a prophet proclaiming that right now. His name is Francis.

There is no likelihood that any coating of any kind managed to survive this treatment.” “I suppose” is that a scientific judgment? You admit that one sample in fact fell apart. Then state “There is NO likely hood that any coating OF ANY KIND managed to survive this treatment.” No likelihood means 100% assurance. I know of few things on this earth 100% assured except in the words of the American rabble rouser and enemy of the English King Benjamin Franklin who wrote: “‘In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” The labs themselves stated they believed their accuracy was a 95%. But NO ONE is claiming that he coating is what was carbon dated, it was the linen threads that were. The importance of the cotton and the encrustrations was that they were a marker in the Raes and crabon samples of the new (medieval) linen. How much time have you spent examining the Scanning Electronic Microscope photographs of the late John Brown of Georgia Tech published by shroud.com in 2005 a few days after peer reviewed papers in Thermocheimca Acta papers. Peer review, like carbon data, is no 100% guarantee of accuracy, but it is a starting point. Outside of Jull’s silly 2010 paper published by Radiocarobon, a journal of which he was the editor, and the original 1989 Nature article which noted only in its acknowledgements but did not comment, on a finding of cotton in the sample, is there any other peer reviewed article you are relying on? In fact when you whnen to the communication of the lab that found the cotton cited you find that cotton was “intertwined” with the sample fibers. In any event the findings of Rogers was that the linen was new and this the carbon dating skewed. Future tests when finally allowed can deal with dating issues at the quantum level. In fact the STURP experiments used various tools that depended on the quantum actions of the samples (flouresence for example is the discharge of a photon when the the material is agitated). Marcello Truzzi who was the philosopher of “pseudo skepticism” stated that when you dispute something as not being proved, unless you present evidence of a contrary position, you can not claim the contrary position has been proved, only that the principal proposition has not been proved. Numerous articles [published in peer reviewed journals have demonstrated that the carbon tests were flawed. There is a wealth of material on shroud.com citing sources on the carbon dating which note false, even supercilious dating results.

It’s a drawing of something the monk saw and he tried to replicate. It may not have been the Shroud but a representation of the Shroud perhaps generations removed from the Shroud. Even photographs copied and reproduced in multiple generations lose detail in each generation. The “L” shaped holes are a fingerprint. That the fingerprint was frequently copied makes them more important not less, unless you can point to actual representations that are clearly the “L” shaped holes and could not have originated with the Shroud – Sayancient China or Egypt circa 1 BCE or earlier – before there was a Christ or a crucifixion. If you can’t, all you have unsupported speculation from a skeptic. That and $5.00 buys a medium mocha at Starbucks.

I was a little unhappy with the picture because the perspective of the picture and perhaps the camera lens made his head much larger than the body. The other day while working on a piece of my work in progress, I was struck by an insight that explains some of the quirkiness that some found in the Shroud image. Bogie’s head in the image is in disproportion to his body. He is sitting and I was taking the picture from above him. The disproportion of the image is essentially an inverted triangle. What it does is define the angle from which the picture was taken. The disproportion that some see in the Shroud, is not proof that it is a painting, it may be an indication of the angles at which different parts of the image were created. Possibly only one, maybe a couple or more. The proof that the Shroud is not a painting was proved by STURP whose examinations were conducted by devices that functioned at the quantum level. We do not understand yet how it was created. I think the biggest fools of all are art experts who proclaim it a painting. Tell me art expert: was he the artist left or right handed? A good one can discern that. Where was the light source? What was the directionality of the brush strokes? How did your medieval artist learn about serum halos around blood clots which on the Shroud revealed by X Rays. Why did he/she add features such as serum halos which were invisible until detected by twentieth century technology? Point is that the “distortions” in the image don’t prove it was a painting. In fact, the variations of proportionality point in the opposite direction.

You have two items that in my opinion are beyond doubt: blood stains and an image that in general support the Gospel accounts. That’s two points which make a straight line. There is no need of coins. Or perhaps it is not a straight line but an arrow pointed towards the Resurrection. I don’t know whether I am bemused or riled by people who claim there could be no physical proof of the Resurrection. What there is physical proof is of is a bloodied body with the image of a crucified man created within three days of his death. There are accounts that he was resurrected. There are accounts of his appearance after the supposed resurrection but that his appearance had changed. There is the account of Mary Magdalene being the first person he appeared to and his warning her not to touch him because he had not yet gone to the Father. There is an account of St. Paul that he appeared to him in a blinding light. Honestly, is there a simpler explanation for these accounts other than he in fact was resurrected? Alas, skeptics who can not accept the fact of resurrection must deny it and blind their eyes to the facts before them. Those who claim that science can NEVER “prove” the resurrection underestimate science because it is knocking on the door and that door is the quantum information of the universe (whatever that is). Perhaps, the issue will not be solved in our lifetime (or at least mine). It may be decades away. But two days ago Pope Francis outlined the horrific future awaiting humanity if it does not repent its selfish abuse of the environment. There is one word he did not use: Apocalypse. I suggest that Apocalypse is an apt description of the future waiting humanity if we can not mend our ways. Four years ago when I first wrote my introduction to the book, I posed a question that was somewhat whimsical: Could this (scientific study of the Shroud) be the coming of a Quantum Christ?

Sometimes it is a little skewed in discussions because the viewers left is the image’s right. Sometimes the reproductions of the Shroud may be reversed and thus more confusion. But the difference between the right and left hair fall is unmistakable. Why would artist do that unless he was copying from something? That is the length of the hair on either side. The right hand side of the image (the viewer’s left) appears shorter than the right or falls differently. That’s present in the image. The first known representation of that is the Shroud of Turin and I think that one right short, left long as a convention had to start somewhere. The starting place was the Shroud.

Given that the image at issue was painted in Constantinople, and its provenance is established, I believe the identity between the the Shroud and this copy is established. The fact that it’s the image of the mandylion that shows this and NONE of the W Eiki icons do is remarkable.

This is a slight piece of evidence but when it combines with all the other circumstance it is more than intriguing. Okay all you Occam maniacs. Is there a simpler solution as to why the support is slanted and the slanted support became an Byzantine convention? Perhaps Charles freeman can give us some background on the slanted foot piece.

I have trouble with the vase. However, there are two Vignon markings present in the paintings that are fairly convincing. Remembering that you are looking at the pictures and the at the what is on your right is actually the left side of the image here’s two: (one) the hair on the left shoulder (your right) is longer and drops to the shoulder while on the right (your left) it seems to flow behind the head.: (two) There is a indication of hair (or what may have been blood or a combination of the same), streaming down the upper forehead in an inverted “V.” This is also found very pronounced on some Justinian coins. It is very faint but there is an inverted “V” on the Shroud’s forehead as well as as a more pronounced “E” shape. Whatever you want to call it, the inverted “V” and the different lengths of hair appear to be an artistic convention.But something doesn’t get to be a convention until it’s done originally once by someone or something. All of the items expressing these conventions have clearly human origins whether painting or engraving. Only one doesn’t. It’s called the Shroud of Turin and the fact it’s image and the what became conventions are inexplicable identifies it as the origin of the conventions. Is there any other image expressing these conventions that can not be shown to be the product of human artistry? I am serious.

We can eliminate him as a forger of the Shroud. But Lai is drawing today when negative images are well understood from the days of film photography. The issue is the existence of a medieval artist who would have drawn a negative image 400 hundred years before the the invention of photography.. In addition, one of the scientific findings of STURP which has not been challenged is the lack of directionality. It would be pretty hard to claim that the image created by Mr.Lai lacks directionality. When the dispute about the drawing of La Principesa was in gear one of the attributes that led to Da Vinci was that the direction of the drawing was clearly left handed. Finally, there is no evidence of paint or any other medium. There are a multiple number of circumstances pointing to the conclusion that the image is not a painting or the work of any artist. Without a clear historical precedent which meets all the relevant circumstances, then any other solution is mere speculation, or as they say upstate, hogwash. Incidentally, I don’t want to be too commercial, but there is a discussion of directionality and Da Vinci in Chapter 14 of Quantum Christ.

But the fact is they concurred on the fact that the image was not a painting. Your hypothetical “linen” expert who isn’t qualified with either deep physics or chemistry is not qualified to to express a scientific opinion. Once you get beyond carbon data there really can’t be a dispute. The evidence that the carbon data samples where not representative of the main body of the Shroud is absolute.
