An excellent article on the invisible reweaving by Benford and Marino is located at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/histsupt.pdf They first came to attention of the Shroud community in 2000 by presentation a Shroud Conference at Ovieto, Italy. Barrie Schwartz was there and was impressed, so he published there paper on Shroud.com Ray Rogers called Barrie objecting to his publishing items from the “lunatic fringe” and that he could rebut them in fifteen minutes. Schwortz challenged him to do just that. Rogers hung up and examined some fibers from the Raes sample that had been given to him in 1978. He didn’t call back in five minutes, but when he did he exclaimed, “They’re right!” Actually, the findings by Rogers had been presaged twelve years before when a laboratory was contacted by Oxford to examine some fibers found in their sample. The results of that examination were never revealed by Oxford but shortly after the announcement of the C 14 results, an article was published about the Oxford fibers that totally presaged Rogers, Benford and Marino by 12 years.

I will give my inexpert answers and hopefully maybe someone with specific expertise can correct me, 1. What is an artistic convention? I believe an artistic convention is that something is portrayed in a similar way across a series of works so that eventually with a specific class or culture, it is portrayed in the same way. For example during the medieval ages, the crucified Christ was pictured with the nails driven through his hands and with a crown of thorns being a simple wreath. Those of course are not the conclusions drawn by most when analyzing the Shroud of Turin. 2. Doesn’t a convention have to start some where with a singular representation, or does it simply blossom all at once in many different places with no single origin? I would suggest that a convention begins with a single model or inspiration that is then copied and spread. 3. Do disparate conventions have disparate origins? For example, The Shroud of Turin shows no whip wounds on the chest.(Flogging with a whip on the chest would hasten death and possibly deny the executioners their crucifixion) Yet crucifixion renditions show flogging or lashes wounds on the chest. Am I correct that the Shroud does not? 4. Would it be fair to expect that oldest representation of any particular convention would be the first? 5. If all but one representation of a convention are paintings or works of art, and one isn’t and apparently predates the paintings or other works of art, is fair to say that the non painting probably is the source of the convention? 6. Am I being too obvious? Well, maybe so, but the origins of conventions that mimic the Shroud of Turin is, as many have already pointed out (Vignon and Wilson among others) that supports an early date for the Shroud,.","date":"2013-10-20","mins":"9:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/20/an-intriguing-9th-century-image-suggestive-of-the-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-max-patrick-hamon/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Intriguing 9th Century Image Suggestive of the Shroud – A Guest Posting by Max Patrick Hamon"},{"id":"comment-47878","author":"john_klotz","post":"Didn’t Colin B post to this blog that he wouldn’t have accepted the handcuffs placed on the selection process by the Vatican (at the instigation of the the carbon labs, by the way.)

STURP scientists had information in hand that would have prevented the chosen sample to be representative of the whole Shroud and required another site.. It was madness to chose the site they did, but madness the pseudo skeptics must latch onto to “prove” the medieval date of the Shroud. The fact that Jull is still fighting a rearguard action defending the Shroud demonstrates if not intellectual dishonesty, at least a desperate attempt to evade the truth. I would have thought the issue was effectively closed, but it will live on because the pseudo skeptics can accept the truth of the Shroud’s authenticity without calling into question their whole world view.

But when taken in conjunction with other representations, it points i a direction. There is enough uniqueness about the Shroud image that the appearance of its unique features in other works tends to indicate its antiquity and thus its highly probable authenticity. Because it is not a painting and was not created by ANY known process, it also points in the direction of the Resurrection.

I believe that in one of the singular events of human history, about 30 CE (30 AD) Jesus Christ rose from the dead.

(Go for it Hugh) We are dealing with an event without direct precedence in human experience and New Testament accounts that were written from earlier traditions, 70 or so years after the fact. I think we may be getting closer to the truth. I personally believe that Isabel Piczek’s description of the image as an “event horizon “may be closer to the money than those put forward in these postulations.

Oxford claims that its pieces were used up. I don’t know what Zurich has said. Pam Moon was able to pry a copy of a photograph of Oxford’s sample before its was destroyed and had the photo examined by an expert and the results were dramatic. Coupled with the report that Oxford had discovered yellow cotton fibers entangled with the linen (as published in the BSTS), it appears that Oxford in doing its testing removed (a) cotton fibers and (b) probably black threads which were the indication of repairs by Valfre but would have appeared as random contamination to scientists who were totally at sea about the history of the Shroud when it was owned by the Savoys. Someone pointed out to me yesterday that the problem with the edges being frayed was not just the rough handling by the bishops but also the simple fact that the the Savoys were cutting pieces from the corner edges as relics for favored individuals. It appears that pieces from the Shroud edge were virtually parts of the dowry of Savoy princesses. When I first examined the Shroud photos closely one of the most striking thing was the very visible, large rectangular pieces from two corners of the Shroud, Those cuttings may have caused unraveling of the linen that had to be repaired. More so, perhaps, than the bishops. Rogers obviously could not carbon date the fibers that he had but he was able to discover important differences in composition between the fibers from the test area and the main body of the cloth. You can quarrel about what the differences meant but they were real. The fact that cotton discovered by Oxford was yellow matches the findings of Rogers and his colleagues. As far as I know, cotton is naturally white. Ever see a cotton field? I have.

Gonella played no role in the curtailing and virtual elimination of the protocols and the ouster of STURP from further examination of the SHROUD until after the carbon dating [Which rendered further testing moot for the time being. Turin and the Vatican felt burned, even betrayed. Emanuella Marinelli quotes Gonella has saying; “We were blacked mailed” on a presenation to the 2012 Valnecia Conference.] This is from my book which is the personal recollection of Rolfe’s contacts with Gonella prior to the formal announcement of the labs and the procedures for cutting the sample: “In May, Rolfe met with Gonella in Turin. Gonella informed him about changes in protocol that were going to be made. Rolfe was aghast. The ground had shifted. As he later noted:” “’All the meticulous preparations for the test were set aside. It was almost as if they didn’t care anymore. “‘They just abandoned all the protocols that had been agreed to by the international team of scientists, cut one sample from the corner (instead of seven from different areas), and sent it off to three arbitrarily selected laboratories (instead of blind and controlled tests to the world’s leading seven laboratories) “’Luigi was pale and apologetic. Hours before my [Rolfe’s] arrival he had been instructed ‘from above’ to abandon the protocols, scale back the tests and to allow just three of the labs to have a sample selected at random on the day. This was in sharp contrast to seven labs testing samples taken from several different strategically selected areas Even more disappointing from my point of view was the absence of anything binding on the labs to coordinate publication. De facto, the method of sampling would also make any real claim for the tests being done blind meaningless’.” “On June 5, 1987, Rolfe wrote his collaborators informing them that as far as he was concerned, the game was over.

Whatever any imperfections may be claimed, the one thing is absolutely clear: the tests for Vanillin on the carbon Raes samples and the test for vanillin on the main body of the Shroud gave dramatically different results. That means they were chemically different. Other than ignorantly rejecting Rogers findings of a difference, how would the skeptics explain the difference.

A pseudo skeptic is one who pretends to be open minded when asking questions but in fact is seeking to validate a contrary, pre existing belief. I would suggest that the “atheist pope” Richard Dawkins is also the world’s leading pseudo skeptic because he seeks to validate his atheism. The existence of any God is beyond question to him. There is no god and that’s that. Thus he discards everything in scripture. He may seem to hedge, but he uses too many semantic tricks. There’s the way he treats Teilhard in the God Delusion for example. But now to your main point (I think). I really can’t spend much time debating. The STURP team examined the Shroud with extremely precise optical instruments. Rogers found no gum arabic encrustations on the rest of the Shroud and no vanillin which was found on the samples from Raes and the carbon dating sample. I would recommend that you read Emanuella Martinella’s paper submitted at the 2012 Valencia conference. It’s 30 pages long, has 256 footnotes and 52 items in its bibliography.

Leonardo, we now know drew a picture of her for a book celebrating her marriage. But she was indeed a lost princess in two ways. Four months after her wedding and Leonardo’s picture being bound into a celebratory book of her wedding, she died from apparent complications of pregnancy. But the wedding book and the drawing by Leonardo were carried some years later to Warsaw Poland by one of the Duke’s other daughters or heirs. History lost track of it. At some point the drawing was removed from the Warsaw volume and its existence was never recorded any place. There was no mention of it in any of the Leonardo literature prior to 2008.

Http://www.lumiere technology.com/discoveries.html I think it’s a good analogy for a couple of reasons. First there is the application of spectral imaging technology to an issue of disputed false provenance that helped discover the truth. Second, are the skeptics, almost all of whom never viewed the actual drawing although invited by the owner and had “dogs in the hunt” – vested interest of either themselves or colleagues that were at stake.

As usual, Colin Berry has launched an invective filled attack on STURP in response to a relatively straight forward item from a source THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH STURP (Excuse me for yelling, but this man’s lack of civility and pure bile bothers me. Without the bile it would be simply baloney, although equally indigestible.) This item from a trade textile journal Textile Horizons that did not emanate from any source remotely connected with STURP or even the BSTS. The lab was in fact was contracted for the examination by Oxford (which incidentally was late in reporting its carbon dating results). The only mention of cotton appearing in the samples simply appears at the end of the Nature article, buried amidst numerous acknowledgements: “We thank Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero for allowing us access to the shroud, Professor L. Gonella for his help and support throughout the project and Professor A. Bray for commenting on our statistical assessment of the data. We also thank Miss E. Crowfoot, T. G. H. James, Dr J. Evin, M. Prevost Macillacy, G. Vial, the Mayor of Saint Maximin and the Egypt Exploration Society for assistance in obtaining the three knownage control samples. Oxford thank [sic] P. H. South (Precision Process (Textiles) Ltd, Derby) for examining and identifying the cotton found on the shroud sample;. . .” (emphasis my own) http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm Note that only Oxford “thank”[sic] and that there is no discussion of the nature of the Precision Process report. Also note that P.H. South is cited by name. Further note that in the Textile Horizon’s article, Mr. South excludes the possibility of what they observed being a casual contamination but hypothesizes that it indicates a repair of the Shroud or a combining of the cotton with linen at the time the linen was spun. And the cotton was yellow, And the reaction of the Dr. Berry: invective attacking the STURP scientists who had nothing to do with the carbon dating and apparently alleging that with maniacal cleverness they wore cotton gloves so that the Shroud would be contaminated. I deeply regret the time I have spent drafting this reply. But history teaches that idiocy and histrionics can not be ignored for as Mark Twain once wrote: A lie travels halfway around the world while truth is putting on its shoes.” The truth as known in 1988, I submit, is there was cotton in the samples, it was not casual contamination, and a least one of carbon dating laboratories noted that fact but was rushing to complete the testing because they were late.

Apparently either I have totally lost my ability to communicate a rational idea or Charles Freeman is not an advertisement for the intellectual prowess of of Cambridge graduates. It’s very simple: Different methods of bleaching leave different artifacts. In the case of the linen used on the Shroud it left bands of darker color which obvious on the Shroud. Okay, so people have been bleaching things for maybe 8,000 years or so. They all didn’t do it the same way, And the method some used might not leave artifacts of the process. In the case of the method used in ancient times on the Shroud it caused banding when different batches were used in the object.. Now, I will conceded that the process that caused banding nay have proceeded longer than I thought. One expert wrote a book and said it might have been used to 1250 at the outside. His name was Ray Rogers. But not after that. Benford Marino relied on an Oxford text to say that it stopped circa 300 400 CE. Now even taking Rogers figure of 1250 as the outside that would be the latest date for a forgery and there is no evidence that by 1250 the technology existed to forge the Shroud. In fact, there is now evidence that the technique to forge the Shroud did not exist by 2013 qand it is very doubtful it will exist in 2050 although maybe you never know about the the future. What the banding does demonstrate is that the method used to dye the linen existed at the time of Christ. If it did not THAT would be evidence of in authenticity. The Holland cloth linen did not exhibit bands. That’s because in Holland they developed a method of bleaching that did not lead to banding. The Holland cloth was used by the Poor Clare nuns who repaired the Shroud in circa 1534. But I can not understand how a supposedly educated man does not understand that different methods of bleaching might leave different artifacts of one kind or another. The banding is such an artifact and do not insult everyone’s intelligence by claiming hat the banded dyed linen in the Shroud is indistinguishable from any other method of dying. Really guys and gals, I do not believe that I am that inarticulate and neither was Benford./Marino or Rogers. There may be a disagreement when the dying process used on the Shroud stopped being used, but if any body has any evidence it was used after 1250 I’d like to see it. “Well, maybe” unless backed by facts doesn’t hack it.

To say that people have been bleaching for 6,000 years is to dodge the question. There were different methods bleaching and some of the earliest methods gave uneven results so that when a larger object was made from linen bleached by the early processes bands were created. Evidence wise, it’s akin to fingerprints. Were there no bands that would be evidence casting doubt on the authenticity of the Shroud. If somone were to claim hat he had an oil painting of Julius Ceasar that he posed for while alive, you would laugh at him. Oil paintings for art was not used by the Romans. (Am I wrong?) If you want to say you don’t have time to study the issue, I’ll understand that. If you want to point out an inaccuracy, I’ll accept that. What is unacceptable is to write that bleaching has been done for thousands of years so it makes no difference. Have you ever given forensic evidence in court? Some art experts have. Trying to determine the province of a work of art can be worth tens (if not hundreds) of millions of ddollars. Cf La Principessa. Your answer wouldn’t fly. Usually, the argument is that science demands absolute answers and legal standards such as beyond reasonable doubt do not apply in the august chambers of science. I think that’s nonsense of course. As I have written: “We do not order our lives by proof beyond reasonable doubt.” I also have written: “Fear the person who has no doubt. Witness George Armstrong Custer.” The issue is whether the Shroud linen shows characteristics of an ancient pre medieval bleaching process. The Holland Cloth which is clearly of medieval origin, unlike the Shroud in chief shows no banding and it is clearly medieval having been added to the Shroud circa 1532. The fact the Shroud itself shows banding is an indication that it pre dates medieval. It may not be a 100% solution. But even if it’s 50 50, it’s an indication. The fact the bleaching process of the linen in the Shroud dates to the time of Christ is a fact about the Shroud. It certainly doesn’t eliminate all possibilities. If the Shroud was pristine of bands, that would be evidence of medieval manufacture. It is not a decisive fact as to the ultimate issue but it is a fact to be taken into account.

In common parlance, we think of mold, or spilled milk, coffee, stain, bioplasitc coating maybe insects debris. It some unintended chemical process. However, what Rogers found, and what all the contamination experts ignore, that what occurred with reweaving is NOT contamination as the word is commonalty understood. The reweaving process included new threads of cotton AND NEW THREADS OF LINEN (new being medieval). Cotton dyed yellow was interwoven and spliced with NEW threads of linen because linen does not dye well. May I venture a statement which I would certainly like to see a rebuttal: how does new linen test older? If we were discussing mold or something like that (a coffee spill) that might be empirically demonstrable. But it is a semantic trick to call cotton spliced into new linen “contamination.” I really don’t have the time for a week or so to get into this. However, I really believe if someone is asserting that new linen interwoven in the Shroud samples would give an older date that the original linen, I really have to examine his data. I would suggest though what is needed is an examination of his definition. I must admit that the implication of Rogers finding new linen fibers didn’t really sink in at first, so if any scientists overlooked that then I understand. But if he/she deliberately ignored that then shame on him/her. Also, Only testing of the fiber samples from the sample area can answer the question. That was done by Rogers and the colleagues who he asked to review his work. Maybe Hugh or someone can advise us whether the his experts took into account the interweaving of dyed cotton with the new linen as a part of the repair which Donna Campbell has demonstrated from examination of the Oxford photograph. Pam Moon has described the repair process. It did happen.

The fibers probably came from Holland where the material for the “Holland” cloth came from. (not at the same time). The variations in the results of the three labs reflects the fact that any given part of the samples would have three constituents: original fiber, new fibers and cotton inter woven with the new fibers and dyed yellow so that the new fibers would match the old. That is not any bright idea of mine or Daveb, it’s what Rogers found and the scientists, with whom he collaborated, concurred. The corner of the Shroud from which the samples came was one clutched by the bishops when the Shroud was displayed. What Pam Moon did in her 2014 paper is put into perspective the known documented work of Valfre in repairing frayed parts of the Shroud. I was stunned when observing the photographs in the Donna Campbell 2014 paper by how clearly the evidence of repair in the Oxford sample emerged, including black threads which Valfre used which upset the Poor Sisters of St. Clare who to this day have a special relationship to the Shroud and were actually hovering in the background as STURP did its work in 1978. Undoubtedly, some of this “contamination” was removed by the labs in preparing the sample for incineration which is how the tested carbon was created.

Just make sure you understand how UK libel law works before you publish here, John. It could be expensive as the onus will be on you to prove your case.” Since I have now been threatened for libel for something Gove reported 28 years ago, perhaps it is best that I leave this repetitive discussion. But as I said, the 1988 c 14 tests are no longer a serious issue because the anomaly issue. It’s amazing how easy it is for our British brethren to challenge the scientific work of well established scientist like the late Ray Rogers. I have written what I intend to say about the carbon dating tests and it has been read by at least one or two people in UK without a threat of libel. That’s the second time Charles Freeman has warned me about libel. I guess they know that you can’t libel a dead man so they are free to throw Rogers into the trash can while suppressing free debate on this blog about survivors in the carbon labs. On the other hand, there is the United States Constitution and the following statute which is the law of this land (Since 1789). Also, because the Shroud is a matter of pyblic issues and I believe the particpants in the carbon dating were public figures there is a requirement of proving malice. It can be done. I successfully represented an individual who sued a public figure for libel during a political campaign and we won. I defeated a motion for summary judgment and won the appeal by the City. The City then settled. Tite’s participation in a internationally reported press conference, as well as his position with the British Museum would easily meet the public figure test. Oh well, having seen Stonehenge once in my life, I guess that’s enough. I will miss the Hod Pole on the canal south of Bath though. “28 U.S. Code § 4102 – Recognition Of Foreign Defamation Judgments “(1) In general.— Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a domestic court shall not recognize or enforce a foreign judgment for defamation unless the domestic court determines that— “(A) the defamation law applied in the foreign court’s adjudication provided at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press in that case as would be provided by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and by the constitution and law of the State in which the domestic court is located; or “(B) even if the defamation law applied in the foreign court’s adjudication did not provide as much protection for freedom of speech and press as the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State, the party opposing recognition or enforcement of that foreign judgment would have been found liable for defamation by a domestic court applying the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State in which the domestic court is located. “(2) Burden of establishing application of defamation laws.— The party seeking recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment shall bear the burden of making the showings required under subparagraph (A) or (B)….” One final word. That Tite was being considered for a position at Oxford at the same time he was the impartial monitor of the carbon dating tests is a conflict of interest, at least in this country. If you were suing someone and your judge or referee was seeking employment with the person you are suing, wouldn’t that be a conflict of interest even in England? Or do different rules of ethics apply to Oxford and Cambridge. It certainly would be a conflict here and one would hope across the pond also. Oh, and by the way Charles, in this country the burden is on the defendant to prove falsity, not on the plaintiff to prove truth. And incidentally, that rule was established in the trial of Peter Zenger before the Revolution. It was one of the things that bothered the Brits about those undisciplined colonists.

Also, it was created at a time the body of Jesus was still in it and that the body appears to have disappeared before putrefaction exuded waste materials on to the fabric, An argument that hypothesizes an earthquake of unknown force at an unknown precise time and therefor created the image may provide a some headlines, but those headlines as demonstrated by the earthquake theory are ultimately counter productive.

Hugh is right. There was an unfortunate blow up between Rogers and Jackson becasue Rogers sharply criticized a Jackson article on image formation. I think that colors the live Jackson critique of the reweaving repair thesis. At St. Louis, Jackson who was supposed to moderate a panel discussion began with what I believed was a disingenuous description of the Rogers findings [not by name] on the composition of the sample area. It wasn’t just cotton contamination, but a finding the linen fibers in the samples were new [medieval] linen not created from flax by the same methods used circa 30 CE. In fact, the procedures to turn flax into linen used on the fibers of the main body of the shroud ceased circa 1000 CE. Thus a dispute about how much the sample area was “contaminated” as that word is commonly understood begs the question of how many new linen fibers were used to repair the frayed edge of the Shroud circa 1500 or so, Also, one huge point: the cotton fibers that Oxford found and discarded before the sample was destroyed were “yellow.” I have seen cotton fields in the US and I don’t recall seeing any yellow cotton just a lot of white balls of cotton natural in the fields. Linen does not dye well and Rogers thesis is that the yellow cotton strands were inter woven to give the fibers color that matched the aged kinen which was graudally darkening (light pollution anyone?) Rogers also conceded that the Maynard reaction was not an complete explanation of the image formation process. There was something else. I would point out in my inexpert opinion based upon my human observations, there is one source of radiation that can cause color changes without destroying its object. It’s called light. Museums must sometime guard their treasures against light pollution. When the Mona Lisa was subjected to multi spectral digital imaging, the company that did it had to use special light sources designed to safe guard the Mona Lisa from the light. “He was the light of the world, and the light shone in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it.”.","date":"2015-04-25","mins":"7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/look-at-what-happened-between-1988-and-2015/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Look at what happened between 1988 and 2015"},{"id":"comment-197592","author":"john_klotz","post":"Angel, Thanks for correcting me.

The following is an excerpt from my book that cites an item by Ian Wilson from the BSTS Newsletter published in 1990. “The first intimation of the dangling cotton thread came to the Shroud world in an article by Ian Wilson in the September October 1990 issue of the BSTS Newsletter entitled “Cotton On The Oxford Carbon Dating Sample: “Kindly brought to our attention by the Revd. Kim Dreisbach of Atlanta is a hitherto unnoticed report in the journal Textile Horizons of December 1988 concerning the Shroud sample supplied to the Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratory. Apparently the British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd of Ambergate, Derbyshire was asked by the Oxford laboratory to help identify certain ‘foreign’ fibres observed, isolated and extracted from the Shroud sample prior to its destruction during the carbon dating process. “According to Precision Processes managing director, Peter South: “‘It was while the sample was undergoing tests at the radiocarbon acceleration unit in Oxford that Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place. He mentioned this to his friend Sir James Spooner, chairman of Coats Viyella, to which our firm belongs. Consequently, after several telephone calls, the minute samples, which looked like human hair, were sent to us.’ “Magnified two hundred times by a Precision Processes microscope the fibres became immediately identified as cotton. This might have been explicable as merely from the cotton gloves worn by members of the STURP team in 1978, but for the subsequent information imparted by Peter South:” ‘The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old. Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ “This is not the first time that cotton strands have been identified on a Shroud sample. The Belgian Professor Gilbert Raes observed the same on the sample he studied in 1973, and he deduced that this was a strong indication of Middle Eastern manufacture. Clearly it could be of great interest to learn more both of the age of this cotton, and of the exact reason for its presence on the Shroud.” “BSTS Newsletter No. 26 – September/October 1990 (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n26part6.pdf)” Please note the phrase “bound in.” This was not random surface contamination. And please note that Oxford knew this before the release of the carbon dating results. The red lights were flashing and the siren was blaring. For the labs to have stepped back a bit and dealt with this in their report would have resulted not only in a delay in a releasing their results and probably required a whole new sampling, something that would have virtually impossible to happen. In The Sign, de Wesselow wrote: “The carbon dating of the Shroud will probably go down in history as one of the greatest fiascos in the history of science. It would make an excellent case study for any sociologist interested in exploring the ways in which science is affected by professional biases, prejudices and ambitions, not to mention religious (and irreligious) beliefs.” “Fiasco” was a gross understatement.

Did someone unravel old linen and then add cotton to it? Of course not. The cotton was part of new fibers used to reweave and repair damaged parts of the Shroud.

On March 5, 2015 you posted the following to this blog thread: “Yes, confronted by John Klotz, Goodacre will presumably very easily find a number of experts in radio carbon dating who will tell him that there is no reason to doubt the dating (as I have they are around). “He will no doubt ask which of the critics of the dating who have confronted him have similar expertise. I can’t imagine that no one will refer him to the paper of Flury Lemberg which refutes Rogers after her close up examination of this corner of the Shroud, something never achieved by Marino or Benford. “Anyway no harm in John in trying.” To the very best of my knowledge your statement was factually incorrect. Flury Lemberg never examined the close up “this corner of the Shroud and her statement about that all the Shroud having the same content predated the carbon dating by two years. I would have no knowledge about your basis for that false statement. But others in this thread have pointed out the simple truth that she never had an opportunity to examine personally the pieces cut for carbon sampling. I would ask that you CITE AND QUOTE in this thread the specific authority upon which you rely in making your factual assertion. If she examined the photographs of the cut samples she is no better position than Benford Marino and the experts they consulted or Pam Moon and the expert she consulted who is cited in my Finding Jesus critique. There are pictures of the Oxford carbon sample taken before it was destroyed during the carbon dating process. A source for viewing that sample is cited in my Finding Jesus review. Also cited is Pam Moon’s article on the history of mending of the Shroud by Valtre. In the photograph that black threads. Pam explains their cognizance. Your first reference to Flury Lemberg is sufficient to justify my critique. But you did repeatedly refer to her in the thread. I have recounted the number of times you referred to Flury Lemberg in this context. The recount shows six times. Given the factual claim you made which was false, I do not believe that is a significant fact. It is, as they say, “de minimus.” My book has over 500 footnotes. The review of “Finding Jesus” published on Shroud.com is 14 pages with 31 footnotes. Included as to point in question is a reference to harry Gove’s memoir and an E Mail from Prof. William Meacham responding to an inquiry whether he recalled Fleury Lemberg making her statement in 1986 at the conference referenced by Gove. He confirmed that and then added his interchange with Al Adler. Now its time for me to compliment Professor Goodacre and I sent him a copy of it. I believed, that in fairness, I should inform him of my critique. His response – given my turgid review – was very professional and in good humor. He suggested that I comment on another blog which advocates the Shroud’s medieval fabrication. I checked the site and it appears that the author relied upon the claims of Walter Mc Crone. The blogger is ludicrous. If you would like, E Mail me and I would be send you a copy of my Chapter 9 (free of charge) which demonstrates that. The offer is open to anyone. I begin the Chapter 9 with a quotation from Revelations: “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” Buried in the chapter is a description drawn from Heller’s memoir of his actions upon returning from first post Turin STURP conference: “Saturday, he returned to work, put on his white lab coat and went down the hall to the microscope lab and repeated the examinations, this time using his favorite Leitz microscope.” I didn’t emphasize the relationship of that comment to the initial quote from Revelations hoping that readers would discover it for themselves. As far as I am concerned, the entire STURP team “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”.","date":"2015-04-04","mins":"7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"id":"comment-192519","author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles, Would you care to name your anonymous experts and what they were basing their opinion on?

Here they are again: 27http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud of Turin exhibition/Thomas Ferguson files/Updated report on  the Consideration to the Uniformity and Effects of the Fabric in the Shroud of Turin 5 1.pdf 28http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud of Turin exhibition/Three threads files/BL%20 Sebastian%20for%2 0website%201.pdf I have also cited two sources for the fact that in 1986, Flury Lemberg stated that the Shroud was “all the same in composition.” One was Harry Gove’s memoir on the Shroud and the other was E Mail correspondence with Prof. William Meacham who suffers from a disability that both you and I lack: He was actually at the protocol 1986 protocol conference when she made the statement. He also added an additional bon mot: that Adler at the same conference remarked to him that Flury Lemberg “obviously knew nothing about chemistry of the cloth.” Adler, incidentally, unlike you or I, actually had the opportunity to inspect an analyze fiber from the carbon sample area that had been held back by Turin when the carbon sample was cut and were supplied to him through the good graces of Prof. Gonella, the scientific advisor of the Turin Archbishop. That were later supplied to Ray Rogers. See http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerpaper.pdf I have challenged you or anybody else to tell me when Flury Lemberg had an opportunity to physically examine the Shroud BEFORE the carbon samples were removed and destroyed and you haven’t done that. The evidence is she would have had no such opportunity. Also, I sincerely doubt she, unlike Pam Moon and linen expert Donna Campbell of the Thomas Ferguson firm, does not appear to have ever examined Oxford photograph. In fact, I am informed, and could be corrected, that Ms. Moon had to pry the photograph away from Oxford by the British equivalent of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. I will concede one point right now: the Campbell analysis does not state that repairs were made before 1355. For the existence of the Shroud before than we have to look for other sources. One of them is Flury Lemberg because I assume that you did not in any of your effusive praise for her intentionally overlook the fact that she asserts the authenticity of the Shroud. In fact she has identified stitching of the side seam of the Shroud as reflective of stitching seen in remnants from the Masada which would perforce be evidence of its existence circa 74 CE. In my CNN review, I also cite the evidence of the Shroud’s existence circa 500 CE; in exposition in Constantinople circa 1200 CE and its “fingerprints” seen in the Pray Manuscript circa 1200 CE. Is the evidence circumstantial, of course. However, Richard Dawkins, himself a Shroud skeptic, argues that circumstantial evidence is often more reliable than eyewitness accounts. Dawkins, Richard , pp. 15 16, 106, “Greatest Show on Earth,” Free Press. Kindle Edition. In fact. In my discussion in Chapter 1 of “Quantum Christ” (Rules of the Road) I demonstrated that from just two facts in the third verse of the Ira Gershwin lyrics to “I Can’t Get Started,” Gershwin was twitting i.e. “jerking the chain” of Joseph Kennedy, whose son John was later elected President of the United States. Finally, there is the excellent presentation in de Wesselow’s “The Sign.” As an agnostic he refuses to concede the realty of the Resurrection but as to authenticity of the Shroud, he has no doubt. I understand that you have differences with de Wesselow who had the temerity to write his book without consulting you.

That is someone who claims to be seeking the truth, but is really seeking instead to prove his or her own prejudgment. Given the complexity of the fraud image, you can’t merely be putting up hypotheses with NO factual foundation and satisfy yourself you have succeeded in demonstrating anything. This is a fact: no one has demonstrated the process by which the image was created. No one has explained it scientifically. I expect that someday, long after you and I have shuffled off this mortal coil it may happen but it will be a process beyond our understanding, because it will be the Resurrection. I am sure that not only you, but many Christian believers, will scoff because they want to preserve the mysticism of their faith. However, let me quote Pierre Teilhard de Chardin again: “To outward appearance, the modern world was born of an anti religious movement: man becoming self sufficient and reason supplanting belief. Our generation and the two that preceded it have heard little but talk of the conflict between science and faith; indeed it seemed at one moment a foregone conclusion that the former was destined to take the place of the latter. But, as the tension is prolonged, the conflict visibly seems to need to be resolved in terms of an entirely different form of equilibrium — not in elimination, nor duality, but in synthesis. After close on two centuries of passionate struggles, neither science nor faith has succeeded in discrediting its adversary. On the contrary, it becomes obvious that neither can develop normally without the other. And the reason is simple: the same life animates both. Neither in its impetus nor its achievements can science go to its limits without becoming tinged with mysticism and charged with faith.” Teilhard, Pierre de Chardin; Huxley, Julian; Wall, Bernard (2011 06 21). The Phenomenon Of Man (Kindle Locations 5193 5200). Evergreen Books. Kindle Edition: This is where I part company with so many other who accept the Shroud’s authenticity. In the past two centuries science has pushed it’s knowledge so far and now is theorizing matters which intersect with the issue of the nature of human consciousness. Once again I recommend the Hameroff video who speaks of the quantum knowledge of the universe. I would not claim that Hameroff has everything right. But the implications of his claims which are grounded in science are immense and they are science. Beyond his theories lie not just the question of survival beyond death, but the Resurrection.

You can’t say that you trust the labs and it’s too bad STURP wasn’t involved. The fact is at a meeting in Trondheim, STURP was proposed to give advice on the sampling area since it had conducted rigorous scientific analysis of the composition of the Shroud. STURP also proposed that the C 14 test be concurrent with new tests to following up on its 1978 tests. In the end, the C 14 labs objected to anymore tests because the C 14 would determine if they were necessary. STURP was kicked out of the process altogether. The Labs argued that if the C 14 determined that the Shroud was medieval, then there wouldn’t be a need for further tests. I kid you not. Somebody should have smelled this a long way off but everybody was trusting the integrity of the labs. That was a huge mistake. As they say: “Trust but verify.” There was no verification by independent entities. That was a mistake. The protocols were violated from the very beginning. The selection of samples from only one location chosen by textile “experts” who didn’t know about, or didn’t care about, the scientific findings of STURP that would have eliminated the site chosen because of visualized contamination with quad mosaic photography and several other analytical studies.

Ray Rogers isn’t here to defend is work, and “frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn [about his inability to defend his work].” There are a number of subsidiary facts pointing to the invisible reweaving. That’s because as things now stand the creation of the image is subsidiary issue to the issue of authenticity of the Shroud. That, in my very humble opinion, has been demonstrated. The issue of its history in the lost years is also a subsidiary issue. The Shroud itself is proof of it’s authenticity. The fact that no one can replicate the image doesn’t detract from that and the fact that one theory or another about image creation is proven or dis proven EXCEPT to the extent that failure to account for it by known science or artistry supports the uniqueness and supernatural aura of the Shroud. The DEMONSTRATED physical facts of the Shroud support one rational conclusion: that it is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. No alternative has been proposed except that there might have been some other individual crowned with thorns and crucified, his body was removed from his burial cloth with three days of his death. The probability of that the facts apply to someone else is so remote I can not count the zeros. The reason that probability is so small is that we have four accounts of Christ’s death based on oral and written traditions that state the facts of his death and none of anyone else dying in a like manner. His death was important enough to be noted by the Roman historian Tacitus who was aghast that Pontius Pilate had failed to eradicate the Christus superstition. However, the letters of St. Paul pre date Tacitus’ Annals of Ancient Rome. We now have three highly regarded scientists or academics trumpeting the need for no God and professing their belief that nothing preceded the Universe: Dawkins, Hawking and Krauss. Am I misquoting them? Sort of. Actually they do not so much as proclaim that “nothing” preceded the universe as proclaiming they don’t care about that “nothing.” Maybe I shouldn’t quote Martin Luther King but Bill Clinton: “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.” It depends on what the meaning of “nothing” is.

Are Brown photographs unreliable hearsay? Anything that you did not yourself witness is hearsay. The reports of the carbon labs are in themselves hearsay. You did not perform the tests you rely on what the labs wrote of their tests. That’s hearsay. If you have no time for hearsay you must be very disdainful of Richard Dawkins who in has even less trust in direct testimony: “The dictionary definition of a fact mentions ‘actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred’ (emphasis added). The implied pejorative of that ‘merely’ is a bit of a cheek. Careful inference can be more reliable than ‘actual observation’, however strongly our intuition protests at admitting it.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 15). Free Press. Kindle Edition. He continues: “Obviously, the vast majority of evolutionary change is invisible to direct eye witness observation. Most of it happened before we were born, and in any case it is usually too slow to be seen during an individual’s lifetime. The same is true of the relentless pulling apart of Africa and South America, which occurs, as we shall see in Chapter 9, too slowly for us to notice. With evolution, as with continental drift, inference after the event is all that is available to us, for the obvious reason that we don’t exist until after the event.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18) (pp. 15 16). Free Press. Kindle Edition. Then, Dawkins goes on to make an intriguing analogy: “We are like detectives who come on the scene after a crime has been committed. The murderer’s actions have vanished into the past. The detective has no hope of witnessing the actual crime with his own eyes. In any case, the gorilla suit experiment and others of its kind have taught us to mistrust our own eyes. What the detective does have is traces that remain, and there is a great deal to trust there. There are footprints, fingerprints (and nowadays DNA fingerprints too), bloodstains, letters, diaries. The world is the way the world should be if this and this history, but not that and that history, led up to the present.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 16). Free Press. Kindle Edition. Pardon me, but that is precisely the scientists other than the C 14 labs are doing in the study of the Shroud. The C 14 labs rely on one disputed fact: the C 14 tests of one corner of the Shroud. It is anomalous and all of your bloviating can not change that fact.

Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf In addition, after Roger’s death, a group of scientists at Los Alamos did further tests on the Raes fibers. And there is more. After Rogers ‘death, Barrie Schwortz contacted Robert Villarreal who had been given a Raes fiber by Rogers because he wanted a check on his work through an independent analysis. He hadn’t heard from Rogers but after Schwortz contacted him, Villarreal and his associates conducted a series of tests which the results of which they reported to the 2008 Ohio conference and later at the 2012 Valencia Conference. The Valencia report is reproduced at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf The Ohio report may be found here: http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm Med. Lemberg also stated that there was cotton throughout the Shroud I believe. However, other than transient cotton debris some of which may have come from the gloves of the STURP team, they could not find cotton on the parts they examined and were puzzled by Raes findings. Rogers had samples both Raes and the main body of he Shroud. They were different. Then there is the fact that prior to he release of the C14 results, Oxford was informed of the presence of interwoven cotton in a sample sent by Oxford to Precision Process. It was not transient debris. In the carbon 14 report of the C14 labs published in Nature, buried in the acknowledgements was the following: “Oxford thank P. H. South (Precision Process (Textiles) Ltd, Derby) for examining and identifying the cotton found on the shroud sample..” It was the only mention of cotton anywhere in the C14 Report. South, the head of Precision reported that cotton found on the Oxford sample was: ‘The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old. Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ You can of course choose whatever “expert” you want that agrees with your bias but the physical evidence that cotton as interwoven in the Raes and adjacent carbon sampling sites is there for your examination in the microphotos of Rogers and John Brown. There is no physical evidence of interwoven cotton in the main body of the Shroud. This is a rather long comment.

However, there is something that is not confidential at all. Unlike the Turin reaction to Fanti, Turin had a distinctly different reaction to Rogers peer reviewed 2005 article. Indeed, it rebuked one Turin personality who attacked Rogers and fond his article useful for future scientific investigation. One of the really important items on Shroud.com is a chronology of the C 14 controversy compiled by Joe Marino and Ed Prior. For anyone interested in the controversy it is a must read. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/chronology.pdf Item #37 concerns Rogers 2005 paper and the reaction to it. (pp.20 21) It relevant part (on page 21) covers the reaction to Rogers 2005 paper both here and abroad, particularly in Turin. First he was criticized by Msg. Ghiberti but the rebuttal to Ghiberti came, not from Rogers but “The Diocesan Commission for the Holy Shroud (in Turin)” “Physicist and artist Isabel Piczek wrote ―It is not good enough just to look (with the naked eye) for a re woven patch. It is an invisible reweave, which requires microscopic and microchemical analysis (to discover). Rogers‘ paper has to be accepted. New discoveries always cause lots of controversy, but (Roger‘s report) should be trusted because it was published in a peer reviewed journal (as cited by Muldoon, Shena. ―Was the Dating a Hoax?‖ Inside the Vatican, 13:2 [March 2005], pg. 25). Even after this data was released, Turin‘s Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti told an Italian newspaper, “I am astonished that an expert like Rogers could fall into so many inaccuracies in his article.” However, a short time after that, The Diocesan Commission for the Holy Shroud released another statement, saying that the study of Rogers was “very interesting” and would be the basis for a future study “on the chemical characteristics of the cloth and its possible inhomogeneity‖ (as cited in Muldoon, Shena. ―Was the Dating a Hoax?‖ Inside the Vatican, 13:2 [March 2005], pg. 25.) It cannot be emphasized enough that insofar as he was the only person to have access to main Shroud samples and samples from the C 14 sample area, Roger‘s judgment should carry enormous weight. To see Rogers‘ impressive resume, go to: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogersresume.pdf. From page 34, Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin (Barrie Schwortz, Colorado, 2008) (Available at Lulu.com): “The results of analyses on the Raes sample made it appear that the radiocarbon sample that was cut for dating in 1988 was not valid (Chapter IX). This naturally caused another controversy. The only way to settle the validity question was to obtain some threads from the authentic radiocarbon sample. However, in dealing with Shroud problems, every sample must be documented without any gaps. I finally received a documented sample of radiocarbon yarn segments, both warp and weft, on 12 December 2003. Professor Luigi Gonella had pulled these segments from “the center of the sample” in 1988 at the time of sampling. Their history was known from that date.” Schwortz was the “publisher” of Rogers posthumous book and, along with Rogers’ wife, was carrying out Rogers’ dying request. The words are Rogers’. From Thermacimica Acta “On 12 December 2003, I received samples of both warp and weft threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella had taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. Gonella reported that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.” Please note, that in neither of these statements does Rogers say he received the threads “from” Gonella.” There is no evidence that Rogers received them without authorization. Indeed, the reaction of the Turin authorities, indicates that they were well aware of his source. Life would be simpler if the individual who was intermediary for this sample would come forward. Alas, life and the Shroud, are not simple.

It’s simply this: greed. A had a conversation with someone well versed in the Shrouod from way back. I spoke with him about trying to get the three labs to open up on their samples to see if they have a relationship to Ray Rogers findings. He said it would never happen because ASM carbon testing is now a billion dollar industry and the labs could never admit hey were wrong becasue the financial reprucussions would be horrendous. I immediately thought of Henrietta Lacks. Here’s why. Henrietta Lacks was a poor black woman from Baltimore who died of cancer several decades ago. The Hospital preserved some of her stem cells and they were replicated and became the source of a billions of dollars industry. Her stem cells have built sky scrappers. What did the estate of Henrietta Lacks get out of this: na da, nothing. The C 14 testing of the Shroud was an entirely different procedure and industry. Howver, we are being naive (as I was) in thinking the labs would ever take any steps to jeopardize the validity of their most famous case – the Shroud of Turin. There is too much money at stake. I am reminded in the story in the Gospel where Christ cured a women of possession but that the demons then went out an possessed a heard of swine which became enraged and stampeded over a cliff. The pig herders then drove Christ away. Salvation could wait, the money mattered more. I think that enormous progress has been made but the C 14 tests have not yet made it to the dust bin of history. You can not serve God and Mamon. The scientists who stand by the C 14 testing knowing it was flawed, have made a choice.

Those who who keep demanding that the Church yield the Shroud for investigation to sectarian authority, overlook the fact that the carbon labs have by and large been jealously guarding the remaining pieces of the samples in their position. Zurich appears to be hiding in the Alps. Oxford claims it has no hold back and only Arizona in 20012!!! has allowed inspection at all. Barrie’s photos are interesting and the cooperation initially shown by Jull promising. Now it appears to be withdrawn. Perhaps the academics and critics who direct so much fire at the Church and Turin should direct some of it at Arizona and Zurich (Oxford calims to have no samples remaining). Given the work of Rogers and now Fanti, their silence speaks volumes. The only right to silence in the US is for people accused of a crime. In the absent of that, the rule is a refusal to testify allows the furthest inference possible to be drawn from the evidence of the adversary. Even in complex federal litigation over patents there are procedures for revealing to the court and litigants all manner of claimed “trade secrets” when needed and relevant. Much of the procedure and findings of the labs has been shielded from review by critics. I am not in the position to marshal that criticism today. Perhaps someone else may have the complaints about the labs failing to fully disclose what happened at their finger tips. When I have a chance, I’ll dig it out but for now this controversy becomes a part of Chapter 10: The carbon dating fiasco. I am working on Chapter 12 now and have about four more to go. The evidence of the adversary that Shroud is the burial cloth a man crucified circa 30 CE hasn’t been hidden. But until the laboratories are open about what they have and what they did, there is only one place for the carbon results: the dustbin of history.

You kneel and genuflect at the altar of science and like the popes (in the past) and too many clerics ignore the sins of some priests. You have stated that the sampling procedure was defective. There is no question that the carbon sample site was the worst possible choice. The labs were hungry for the publicity and the money (including government grants) they would flow from the tests. Oxford found, and then ignored evidence of cotton INTERWINED with the linen threads in their sample. The cotton was not enough to skew the sample by itself but it was unique to the area and INTERWINED cotton dd not exist on the Shroud in chief. Ther STURP team, which was aware of Raes comment that his sample had cotton looked for it in 1978 and couldn’t find it. Rogers reported on that fact. They did find ambiemt, promiscuous pieces of cotton deposited through the years but NO intertwined cotton.The pictures of he STURP team taken demonstrate the scrutiny the team did in Turin relatively high powered microscopes. You have posted that you thought the procedures adopted were so bad that you, as a scientist, would have walked away had a beer (was that a beer your mentioned, I don’t recall the brand stateside). In short, you base your skepticism on flawed procedure that you know are flawed by the selection process. Let’s get one thing straight. The labs ignored the protocol they were supposed to follow. One piece of that was that the labs would NOT confer on their results prior to announcement of the results. Instead they did confer and it appears they have adjusted them. Michael Tite who was the the supposed guardian of the process was a candidate to become director of the one of the labs even before the testing (Oxford) was dismissive of the protocols.

The problem is setting proper protocol for tests and reconciling the need for new tests with the issue of preservation. Also, what is the regime for the tests. There have been various reports of new non invasive procedures. We (at least I) need to be educated on these procedures. How good are they? Fanti claims to have dated the Shroud through application of a different procedure. His report of that as to the Shroud was formally peer reviewed and the provenance of is sample threads challenged. However it appears that a general report on the method was published in a peer reviewed journal without reference to the Shroud. Not that peer review is a guarantee of everything. Benford and Marino sought to publish their critique in Radio Carbon and the peer reviewed committee included people connected to the labs they were criticizing. Ideas that challenge the norm are often rejected out of hand. I will begin my section on Christ and the Quantum (I think) with the story of Hans Berger. Totally ridiculed he died an unhappy man. It’s ideas were weird and way out here. Rejected for decades by the scientific establishment. And by the way, he invented and developed one of the primary diagnostic tools of the twentieth century. Tease alert, if you want to know, look him up. There is also another issue: It’s been 25 years since the carbon dating. Surely the technology has advanced since then. I really hope that both the Turin and Ohio conferences will advance and educate on these issues. Maybe I will not be around by the time fruition comes. It might take years. Less than five I might just make it. Maybe if it takes ten, I’ll still be around. Twenty, in my nineties, who knows? But the relative urgency of my desire to know more, can’t short circuit the development of an new protocol for new testing. Carbon dating is only one method of examination. We can now study reactions down to the quantum level. Actually that’s what florescence is and the MRI.Science will hopefully get better not worse. I will make one statement you will probably disagree with. New carbon dating, unlike the 1988 dating MUST be in the context of a panoply of examination processes. That was another error of the 1988 testing, perhaps the basic error, the exclusion of other tests. I have taken the time to answer you because I wanted to point hat I am not so far apart form you and Charles Freeman on the the need for new tests. If we are lucky, except for the Shroud, may we all die with our curiosity unabated. Now I really have to work.
