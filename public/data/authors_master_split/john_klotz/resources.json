Perhaps the sour pusses could stop sucking on heir lemons and rejoice. How far Pope John can go is an interesting question. He made some remarkable appointments and non appointments in the past few days which auger well in my opinion. There have been many interesting incidents that give an insight into this Pope’s soul. One the most interesting was that he personally contacted a an unwed woman carrying the child of her married lover (he apparently had concealed his marriage.) One of the woman’s concerns was that since she wasn’t married, her child would not be baptized. Pope Francis comforted the woman by by promising to baptize the child himself. The other day out of curiosity I checked the church bulletin at my local parish. Sure enough, when it talked about ground rules for baptizing an infant it required a review of the parent(s)’ and God Parent(s) appropriateness. The there is the issue of communion which some prelate’s in the US have been threatening to deny to recalcitrant politicians who did not toe the Church’s mark on a number of issues including gay marriage, contraception and abortion. Francis has said words to the effect that we need communion to nourish us because we are all sinners. Hos recent appointments give us solid indication about his attitude towards the right wing ideologues who have recently controlled the US Catholic Bishop’s Conference. I expect his language in private is reflective of his actions in public.

Louis has made tremendous contributions to the Shroud scholarship but I respectfully differ with him on somethings. My perspective of what a Christian is may differ from his. I think mine may be closer to that of Pope Francis. Some years ago, I pondered a solution to the multiple religions quandary that actually echoed something Bobby Kennedy suggested to his brother and his other advisers dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Khrushchev (like Kennedy) was dealing with a bellicose faction in the military and he sent two messages in near rapid succession. One was quite temperate and promising. The second was bellicose and threatening seeming to shut the door, Bobby’s proposal was to ignore the second message and respond to the first. (There were numerous other factors including a not widely publicized intervention by Pope John XXIII) It worked. What I think the Pope should do, and I think what Pope Francis has effectively been doing is recognize that all those parts of humanity whatever their formal religion are de facto Christians and a part of his flock. His obligation is to all of humanity, not just baptized Catholics. When I was a child (and even a teenager) I was taught that the hallmarks of the true church was that it be One, Holy, Catholic [universal] and Apostolic. By asserting the moral authority of the Christian Gospel and finding common cause with multiple religious leaders Francis is creating a framework for a truly Catholic Church. His essential message becomes you are all Catholics and I am the pope of all. Kind of like the Kennedy’s ignoring the bombast of the second message and concentrating on the first. When we surrender to love, we belong to a universal church whether we want to admit it or not. All of the scriptures and the prophets resolve to this: love. Don’t argue with me, that is what He said.

If the body of Christ underwent a trans formative process, that trans formative process began with a physical object: His body wrapped in the Shroud. Although I don’t intend to do much with the concept right now, Hugh’s initial skepticism that I could construct (with tutelage) a tesseract at age 17 drew my attention to the tesseract: a three dimension representation of a four dimensional cube, the fourth dimension being time. You have in the tomb Christ’s body one instant and in another instant it’s gone. That instant is to people of faith, the Resurrection. What makes anyone think that the process of transformation would leave no traces? It may have been an infinitesimally small instant. (So was the Big Bang) but it was instant. His body transported from one existence to another. Some years ago Isabel Piczek described the Shroud as an “event horizon.” At first I was querulous l. Now I am not. When Christ’s body entered a new dimension or universe of cosmic existence, the Shroud recorded the last visible instant as that happened. I would reference his conversation with Mary Magdalene outside the tomb: “Do not touch me!” In that regard, di Lazzaro’s research is intriguing. Is it a final answer?

The piece was written in 1971 1972 before the environmental community began to focus on “climate change”. Oil was a big source of pollution then as it is today. Alas, pollution seems to be small potatoes compared to climate change. How does climate change connect to the Shroud? I give you the introduction to Chapter 17. The Apocalypse of Selfishness: The Great “So What?” “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather for the sky is red.’ And in the morning, ‘There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and lowering.’ You know then how to discern the face of the sky, and can you not know the signs of the times?” Matthew 16:2 4 It is my premise that the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus, called Christ, and that it offers evidence that supports the claim of his resurrection within three days of his crucifixion. The scientific examination of the Shroud began with the Secondo Pia photographs in 1898. Until then, the facts concerning the death and purported Resurrection were essentially matters of faith drawing on the four Gospels accounts, the Epistles of Christ’s apostles and oral traditions of cloudy provenance. There were even those who claimed that Christ never existed at all. Science has now provided a rock of fact to which believers may cling. But so what? Here’s what: Humanity now faces an apocalyptical extinction as a species. Revelations and other apocalyptical writings have been until now mystical allegories and metaphors. But science is not prophesying in metaphors or allegories – its prophecies of doom are based on hard facts. The Apocalypse that threatens us is an apocalypse of selfishness. The heedless exploitation of our environment has resulted in multiple crises that demand immediate, concerted international cooperation and action, but the very apostles of selfishness that are driving humanity to the brink of extinction bar our way. For prophecy of an apocalypse, let us turn to the current Roman Catholic Pope. “Small yet strong in the love of God, like Saint Francis of Assisi, all of us, as Christians, are called to watch over and protect the fragile world in which we live, and all its peoples. Pope Francis ¶216 Evangelii Gaudium Despite some criticisms from conservative elements in the Church, Francis has not retreated from his elevation of the environment to a religious issue. On May 21, 2014, Pope Francis told an audience; “If we destroy creation, creation will destroy us.” Is Francis right? Was his statement hyperbole or prophecy? Creation destroying us! Is he prophesying an Apocalypse?.","date":"2014-06-26","mins":"8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/26/john-klotz-approaching-book-on-the-shroud/","cat":"article","title":"John Klotz’ Approaching Book on the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-132944","author":"john_klotz","post":"Louis, I could never locate your message. Try klotzlaw@gmail.com As for your comment, I guess I am a “Chardinist” or “Teilhardist” (whichever) when it comes to science and religion. The fact that many scientist adopt “an argument from incredulity” as to Christ and the Resurrection,doesn’t change the fact that science itself is a search for truth and has made amazing progress in unraveling the mysteries of existence. It is now knocking on the door of the mystery of consciousness. It can’t be ignored or pigeon holed. That is why I find the work of Hameroff so interesting. Again, I recommend a brief video of him: For primitive man, anything inexplicable ended up as part of his religion. Thus the volcano was a god, the stars and planets were gods and everything that happened inexplicably was a visitation from god. As human knowledge expanded, the province of the gods shrunk. Now science is knocking on the door of ultimate issues. Some theologians and some science seek to avoid what Teilhard knew was an eventual merger of science into religion. You can’t avoid the science that is exploring the seminal issues of existence. The first physicist to propound a theory of the “Big Bang” creation of the universe was a Belgian priest scholar. He did it my simply taking the calculations that demonstrated an expanding, rather than a static universe and reverse them to an ultimate point where the Universe emerges with a “Big Bang” from nothingness, or what I prefer to call cosmic chaos. (That word may a have a scientific definition of a state other than the one I prefer.) But just as Galileo’s telescope first revealed the magnificent beauty and order of creation, science as to grapples withe the quantum and what lies beyond, is creating a “te deum” of its own. Of course many scientists are agnostic and atheistic, that’s their problem. In some recess of their minds they are apostles of Nietzsche who propounded that “God is Dead.” Spoiler alert: That’s where I am heading with this chapter, the Apocalypse of Selfishness. We have institutionalized selfishness and besides Nietzsche, among the apostles of the Antichrist are Ayn Rand and the Austrian School of Economics. Those apostles are the subject Pope Francis withering disdain. That’s some agenda I have set for myself, I have already accumulated well over 100 items in my Apocalypse research folder (digitized).

I do not recall whether I had even heard of Nietzsche at that point but may have seen some tangential references that had registered very much. The Professor read “The Madman” to us and it was quite a moment. When the mad men told the people that God is dead but he has died beyond the space and news of his death hadn’t reached us yet, I was quite taken. Not by his philosophy but his insight. Nietzsche was primarily a late 19th century writer but I felt that the news of God’s death arrived with a bang in WWI and the reverberations of that echo still. However, philosophically, Nietzsche’s philosophy of the superman beyond morality never became a part of my thinking. Strauss wrote a piece inspired by Nietzsche entitled “Thus Spake Zarathusta (auf Englshe). It’s opening bars were the introduction in the Kubrick and Arthur Clarke’s “2001, a Space Odyssey.” It was clearly informed by Nietzsche’s superman credo. At the end, as the world is destroyed by nuclear one only one man, the surviving astronaut who has morphed into an eternal entity has survived.

It may seem an odd topic for some but a posting today on the Shroudstory blog brings it in to stark relevance particularly with the atrocities being committed by the fanatics of ISIL (As evil as their persecution of Christians have been, it is maybe that they have slaughtered more Moslems that Christians). The story is this: a group of Moslems visited the current exposition of the Shroud in Turin as a gesture of unity of all humanity. See https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/the imams who came to see the shroud/ And if you are interested in what my book is about: http://johnklotz.blogspot.com There reviews and comments on that posting. In Chapter two of the book, quote Elaine Pagels writing in her book the Gnsotic Gospels: https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/the imams who came to see the shroud/ (It was a part of my Christmas posting on my blog.) Orthodox Christianity teaches that the tree of faith was enriched by the blood of the martyrs. Elaine Pagels, hardly a Vatican favorite, concluded that the example set by the Christian martyrs was in fact a key to orthodox Christianity’s ascendancy over its gnostic competitors. “No doubt the persecutions terrified many into avoiding contact with Christians, but Justin and Tertullian both say that the sight of martyrs aroused the wonder and admiration that impelled them to investigate the movement, and then to join it. And both attest that this happened to many others. (As Justin remarked: “The more such things happen, the more do others, in larger numbers, become believers.”) Tertullian writes in defiance to Scapula, the proconsul of Carthage: ‘Your cruelty is our glory … All who witness the noble patience of [the martyrs], are struck with misgivings, are inflamed with desire to examine the situation … and as soon as they come to know the truth, they immediately enroll themselves as its disciples.’[i]” Pagels then puts martyrdom in the context of Christ’s life in words that echo Pasternak: “In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.”[ii] ..","date":"2015-04-21","mins":"7:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/the-imams-who-came-to-see-the-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Imams Who Came to See the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-120735","author":"john_klotz","post":"The point here is not that the author is a bat*** reactionary, Ann Randian freak.

What did the cover look like?” STURP used spectral analysis to the greatest extent possible. The Quad Mosaics were a “primitive” form which did not actually yield data as to composition. Heller used digital analysis to arrive at the conclusion that the bloodstains were in fact bloodstains. If there is one procedure that properly performed is non intrusive its spectral digital analysis. It might cost a few bucks or euros. What is needed is a desire to do it and an organization dedicated to its use to raise the money fund it. Something like a single purpose STURP. I say single purpose because a broad based, multi tasking study like STURP is politically not feasible.

Barrie can speak for himself but the facts, as he reported in the BSTS Journal and other places are that as a Jew (whether observant or not) he was reluctant to get involved with a “Christian” relic. One colleague, who was also Jewish (Don Devan) convinced him that because they were Jewish and had no one would expect them to have a bias toward authenticity. “So at Don’s [Devan’s] suggestion, I became a member of the STURP team, but I didn’t feel very comfortable about it. In fact, a few months into the project, I remember jokingly saying to Don Lynn at one of our many meetings, ‘”What’s a nice Jewish boy like me doing on a Christian Project like this?’ “Don smiled and answered that perhaps I had forgotten that ‘the Man in question was also a Jew.’ “’No, I knew that,’ I stated. So then Don gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever been given. He said, ‘God doesn’t tell us in advance what the plan is. Go to Turin and do the best job you can. Someday, you’ll know why.’ His words kept me on the team at that time when I was seriously considering quitting. And to make a long story short, he certainly was right!” Barrie’s lingering doubt was the issue of the blood evidence and its bright color. An explanation offered in a discussion with Al Adler in the 1990’s finally resolved that issue. In 1995, a friend called him told that the friend and his wife had seen a headline in a sensationalist magazine sold at supermarket checkout counters that revealed that the Shroud was “a photograph” created by Leonardo Da Vinci.” Schwortz decided that the resources, including his own photographs of the 1978 STURP examination which he had shared with numerous authors, needed a wider audience. He made a note in a file folder sitting on his desk: “Consider building a website.” A short time later he had a conversation with Don Lynn and reminded him of the advice he had received: : “Years ago, when you told me that someday I would know why I was on the Shroud team, well, you were right. I’ve finally figured it out and it only took eighteen years!” There are a lot of things the press has gotten wrong about the Shroud at various times. Don’t be too hard on a reporter for a little hyperbole because the essence of what he was reporting is true: Barrie approached the Shroud as a skeptic and had lingering doubts of authenticity for many years after. He was also a skeptic of the carbon dating because on thing h did know from the STURP examination: the Shroud was not a painting. I certainly hope the pseudo skeptics who sometimes populate this blog don’t use your post as an excuse to launch any attack on Barrie or the press.

We have an expression “res ipsa loquitur:” the facts speak for themselves. In this case the only fact that challenges the authenticity of the Shroud is the carbon dating which has been refuted by Ray Rogers among others. On the other hand when you add up all the other facts, the only logical conclusion is that the Shroud is authentic. There is no other person from the first century CE that has been identified that suffered and died like Christ. The Shroud and the common facts among the four Gospel accounts of the Crucifixion complement and reinforce each other. I won’t bother to refute Mc Cone, Shroud.com and shroudstory.com contain ample rebuttal. To evaluate Mc Cone with Rogers is preposterous and it is the kind of logic the underlies some of the insanity of our times. Take for example the creationists who belivee the Universe is 6,000 years old. There are times when we have to choose and any one who is intellectually honestly open to the facts will I believe choose Rogers. The real mystery about the Shroud is how the imagine was created. Clearly not by human hand but by some yet unidentified process. There are theories but none thus far have proved out. I believe that what we have seen in the Shroud thus far offers support for the Resurrection but not yet proof. As far its authenticity is concerned, the case is sufficient and I believe we should move on to the real mystery of image creation.

Whoever insists upon these shrouds’ authenticity cannot be adhering to rigorous intellectual discipline.” Prof. Bollone, appearing on an Italian state television broadcast called Mixer, replied: “These days no serious scholar — and a review of the specialized literature proves this — believes in the ‘late medieval’ thesis suggested by the 1988 radiocarbon analysis.” The professor went on to insist: “The Shroud is mentioned in documents composed before the date established by C 14.

I had not limited my inquiry to representations of Christ. This image is unique, It’s existence is quite fragile because of the fact that it is among other things it is simply a discoloration of a either the outer cell wall of a fibrile or according to Rogers may be the discoloration not of the linen fibriles but of a containment left over from the retting process. Rogers had an advantage because he had access to actual fibers from the linen. He was a chemist with impeccable credentials. Ultimately in his book he conceded he did not have the answer as to the actual formation process. I have a sincere hope that advances in mutilspectral digital analysis may provide some more definitive answers as to the nature of image and its relationship to the Shroud, The Vatican will have to get off the dime on this. That’s a challenge Pope Francis faces. I will also venture into Charles area of expertise with an amateurish proposition: If there is a convention it must have started somewhere. There had to be an original object that caught artist’ attention had then was adopted by them. The Shroud was, as far as we know, not created by an artist. Yet, there were clearly paintings of a images on large pieces of cloth that appeared in Medieval times which mimic the Shroud. Without getting into a debate about this because I must get Chapter 18 written,and the manuscript concluded there are more than three authors who have written extensively about the uniqueness of the Shroud image: Paul Vignon, Ian Wilson and Thomas de Wesselow. The various representations of the Shroud which incorporate unique aspects of the image of the Shroud were clearly paintings and drawings. Many of them disappeared in the bonfires of the French Revolution. The Shroud didn’t and the fact it didn’t is a first blush a stroke of good luck. I am not a fan of those who believe that everything in life is “God’s will” or divine providence. I remember from my High School religious instruction the following: If you build a house on a flood plain and a flood comes and sweeps it away, that’s not divine providence, it’s human stupidity. Humanity has in effect built its house on a flood plain and the flood is coming. It’s climate change and we are threatened literally with extinction. That extinction if it comes will be the result of millions of selfish decisions made in the course of the Industrial Revolution. It is a “tragedy of the commons.” The proposition to mull over is the same as I learned more than 50 years ago: the Sixth Extinction is not divine providence it’s human selfishness. The survival of the Shroud to this time and place and the reintroduction of Christ into the discourse through the science of the Shroud may not be blind luck but Divine Providence.

The ancient Greek mechanism, you describe is essentially a mechanical computer appears to be similar to what is still in existence from 1452 – the Bourges Cathedral astronomical clock. No one has yet to produce an image and you can not identify an image with the properties of the Shroud. Alger Hiss was convicted if perjury for denying that he had given secret documents to Whitaker Chambers a confessed Communist spy who eventually rejected Marxism. One of the pieces of evidence against Hiss is that exert testimony disclosed that documents had been retyped on a typewriter in Hiss’s possession. After conviction, Martin Tytell was hired on the appeal and he produced (after two years) a typewriter that could duplicate the same identifying typographical aspects that were supposedly unique to the Hiss typewriter. The conviction was not set aside. Just because you can forge or copy something, doesn’t ,mean that the object in question was forged. There are cases where art forgers have produced paintings so true to an original master style, that art experts have vouched for their authenticity in court under oath and been eventually proven wrong. To say that ancient Greeks devised an analog computer found in pieces and then reconstructed, proves absolutely nothing about the issue of the originality of image in a totally inexplicable medium.

Sox is a late blooming admirer of Ulysses Chevalier, the French cleric who was the bane of Pia’s existence. He more less adopts the whole D’Arcis painted forgery schtick and frankly, with all do respect, that is an absurdity and indicates his desperation to prove the Shroud a forgery. His book is entitled: “The Shroud Unmasked: Uncovering the Greatest Forgery of All Time.” I in no way mean to diminish the importance of the Shroud, but there are other candidates for the “Greatest Forgery of All Time.” The millions Hitler killed in the Holocaust or who were victims of Czarist pogroms might suggest “The Protocols of Zion.” I guess because the image can not be explained by either scientists or art historians, that might make it a great forgery if it were one, or it might just make it the truth.

How’s that for gibberish jargon except its not. Science is intruding on religion and millennia of philosophical musings and constructs are headed for the dust bin of history. Please don’t bother me or the rest of civilization with Cartesian constructs. They no ,longer apply. What I have essentially read so far are philosophical objections and not scientific ones. Teilhard foresaw a convergence of science and religion..I don’t see evidence of that in the comments. A classmate of mine from high school, last year (who is a retired but active emeritus professor with a Ph D in Physics from Carnegie – Mellon) directed me to a video of Stuart Hameroff discussing the operation of the brain in term of quantum “action at a distance” or entanglement. When quantum entanglement first appeared, Einstein, arguably the greatest mind of the twentieth century, called in “spooky” and at first rejected it. Quantum mechanics is to the mind captured in a Newtonian net is weird. But it’s not a philosophy, it’s science..The existence of the Shroud is not a philosophical construct, it’s as physical reality as real as Pike’s Peak. Science has told us how Pike’s Peak came to be. There is an enduring mystery of how the Shroud image came to be. Science is not ready to solve that mystery yet. It will probably not be solved in my lifetime. But you younger guys and gals write this down. This is my prophecy: when the problem of the image formation is solved, Science will be staring the Resurrection (note the capital “R”) in the face. David R. I’ll make a challenge to you. Forget your personally designed IQ test. Find an impartial authority and we compete in an IQ test. When I was 11 years old I had an extraordinary result in an individual test at Syracuse U. When a professor called my mother to explain the results he didn’t give the real number. When my mother said my oldest brother (five boys in the family) had an IQ of 130, he replied, “Oh he (moi) is much higher than that. In my mid forties, enduring a typical crisis of confidence, I took the Mensa test. I passed. That meant at least the 98%. There is no such thing as the 100 percentile. 98% is a genius level, is it not? If not it’s still pretty good for an old man of 40. (When I took it) I really hate to go there because if I’m so smart, why ain’t I rich? Some years ago, I ran in a Democratic primary for District Attorney of the Bronx. Initially, I am informed I had the highest Q rating. Of the five contestants. That measures public favorabilty of name recognition, essentially. However, that faded. It would have taken a half a million dollars (which two opponents had) and my funds never hit more than mid five figures A very well known influential politician who should of supported me didn’t. When he was asked by one of his contributors to do so, he snapped: “John Klotz only does what John Klotz wants to do.” When it was reported back to me, the hackles on my neck rose temporarily, but any anger subsided. “Put it on my tombstone,” I thought “He only did what he wanted to do.” That particularly politician brushed me off publicly as a “courageous gadfly.”: He meant it as a put down. I thought of Plato:(Socrates?) “I am that gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long …arousing and persuading and reproaching…You will not easily find another like me.” Incidentally, we are now on good terms. It’s like nothing ever happened. My next Chapter after I finish this one will be “Apocalypse Now.” It’s theme will be that anti Christ selfishness is on the verge of destroying humanity. That, by the way is a purely scientific argument. I do have a metaphorical anti Christ in mind. It’s called the Austrian School of Economics. It is the the system which led to the Michael Douglas quote in Wall Street,, “Greed is Good.” It’s not.. Don’t trust me, read the Gospel of Matthew. Or maybe the National Geographic or yesterday’s New York Times about Bangladesh..( I mean Sunday, March 30th.) I appreciate constructive comments. Try my blog. Of course, it’s monitored. I once had someone stalking me on the web. He included comments like my relatives all burning in Hell. Or my oldest brother being a racist because I quoted one of his comments about JFK in WWII not being a hero. “The only thing he ever did is get his PT boat run over by a J*p destroyer.” By the way, JFK was a hero of mine. Http://www.johnklotz.com/new jfk.htm You can see all of my previous publications at http://www.johnklotz.com/publish.htm I once won an Honorable Mention from the NYS Press Association for in depth reporting. And was a contributing editor to the now defunct “Eastside Express.” The article I won the award for revealed judicial misconduct and led to the discipline of five judges. My personal favorite site is: Danny Boy, a Rememberance http://www.johnklotz.com/billy.htm Did I ever tell you that my brother Ray coined the phrase “muti taslking.” Honest.

Nothing could be more “spiritual” than out of body experiences (OBE) or near death experiences (NDE). Yet Hameroff has postulated a “physical” quantum explanation that would also apply to immorality. That doesn’t mean there is no immortality or OBE or NDE. It means that these phenomena can be explained scientifically. And that doesn’t make us all atheists either. It gives fresh meaning to the old hymn: How Great thou Art. I find that exciting. As I point out in material which I do not think I have posted and will not if I haven’t because it’s a crucial part of the manuscript, Teilhard’s construction of the inner and outer aspects of existent objects has it’s root in scholastic philosophy which had echoes of Plato. But it is not philosophy, it is,, as Teilhard, insisted, science. All of these philosophical distinctions that allow philosophers to mask the hard facts of reality are melting away in the face of quantum phenomena. The quantum is a mystery, but if you don’t know quantum is a physical phenomenon – even if it is subject to consciousness – you don’t know jack. Consciousness becomes the ultimate physical phenomenon. And there I go again, back to God has being the primodial consciousness.

I have recently read the original Paul Vignon book on the Shroud originally published in 1902 which was reissued in English in 2002. I got it through Amazon. In 1902, more than three decades before he published his “Vignon Markings” he compared medieval depictions of Christ and found them inferior to the Shroud image and quite different. I was originally attracted to Christ to Coke because its author Martin Kemp was the leading art historian backing the Da Vinci origination of what he dubbed “La Principessa” an art scandal par excellence when Christie evaluated a 100 million dollar drawing for $17,000 and sold it on consignment. See National Geographic Feb 2012, p. 101 Kudos to Martin Kemp for “La Principessa.” Really! Bronx cheer for “Christ to Coke!!” His opinion is ignorant and a disgrace for an expert. I say “ignorant” because he obviously didn’t do his homework on the Shroud. He cites Pantocrator as the ultimate Christ icon and ignores or does not know about the well publicized Vignon markings linking to the Shroud image to the Pantocrator. He is dismissive of Ian Wilson’s “Mandylion theory,” and list Wilson’s latest book as “Reading” as well as the entire Shroud.com cite.(Kindle Edition location 1005). He ignores the Vignon markings even though they are discussed in the book he lists as “Reading.” (Kemp, Martin [2011 10 13]. Christ to Coke : How Image Becomes Icon, Figure 26, Kindle Edition location 2680) And he sort of grouses about the carbon dating controversy and then swallows it whole hog. His attribution of it to the Medieval/Renaisance times as a painting by an unknown Italian or French artists is – GIVEN THE EVIDENCE – absurd. “If I were asked to provide an art historical date for the portrayal of Christ on the Shroud, I would estimate it have been made in the later thirteenth or first half of the fourteenth century in Italy or southern France. This is consistent with the much denigrated carbon dating.” (Kemp: Kindle Locations 954 956). It is not a painting. If anything, what Barrie Schwortz has estimated to be more than a quarter of a million hours of Shroud research has demonstrated that. However, I have a working theory or an opinion about Mr. Kemp’s astute blindness. One of the bases of his La Principessa opinion is carbon dating that was done on its vellum which dated it to Da Vinci’s time. Is it possible that Oxford Don Kemp used Oxford’s very own carbon dating lab to do the dating? If so, is his attack on the Shroud authenticity occasioned by a necessity to, at least indirectly, defend the Oxford carbon dating lab? Perhaps the good Professor could enlighten us on who did his carbon dating? Just asking. Were we in court and he was testifying as an expert on the Shroud, it would be an admissible question on cross examination.

I guess the problem is the literal translation of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments. I wonder if either of the writers read Genesis literally. Pope Benedict certainly doesn’t. It’s not history, it is metaphor or allegory but we have much to learn from Genesis. Four thousand years ago religion explained everything from the blowing of the wind to the flicker of the fire. The first scientists were the ancient priests. Science and religion sprang form the same soil. We have earned many things in the ensuing millennia and many things that were religion are now science. Now science is nibbling at what would seem to be purely religious questions: most importantly the nature of consciousness and the soul. If you believe in God as creator, then He must have left fingerprints. Certainly the Shroud is such a fingerprint. But the quantum level of existence is something more: it is an interface and its seeming irrationality I believe is evidence that at the quantum level we are just one step removed from that consciousness from which all existence has proceeded and to which all shall return. Ultimately all of the law and all of the prophets resolve to one word and concept: love. What is exciting to me is how at the quantum level some see love not as an abstraction but a reality. When Galileo demonstrated the folly of Ptolemy, he was nearly burned at the stake and had to recant the truth. It was Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in the Phenomenon of Man who wrote of a synthesis of Science and Religion, something the militant atheists like Dawkins would ultimately reject. But in the scientific study of the Shroud that is what we are doing. If that study demonstrates support for the Resurrection, is that bad? If you truly believe in Christ, do not fear science. I believe that in this skeptical age the Shroud is a “game changer.” Is it perhaps Divine Providence that just when science is knocking on the door of the ultimate issues of existence, science is also proving the reality and vitality of Christ: crucified and Resurrected?.","date":"2011-12-31","mins":"8:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/29/the-coming-of-the-quantum-christ/","cat":"books","title":"The Coming of the Quantum Christ"},{"id":"comment-6472","author":"john_klotz","post":"Thanks for your comments.

Dame Isabel Piscek at Dallas was quoted as saying “The Shroud of Turin is the Future of Science.” As some point I will credit her.

Although I think Occam’s Razor is much over used, I have suddenly found my self resorting to it. There ares several permutations of it. Basically I beleive the most sophisticated form is that the solution that requires to the fewest assumptions is more likely the correct one. But it is rephrased. In the military there developed the KISS principle which has two variation depending if you use a comma. It can be “Keep it simple, stupid.” (with a comma) which calls the addressee stupid. Or it can be without a comma: “Keep it simple stupid” which means that the ultimate in simplicity should be “simple stupid.” [understandable by even stupid people]. I have found the work of Daryl Domning very intriguing. There is an article of his available on the web site of the Jesuit web site of the Jesuit web site America: See Evolution, Evil and Original Sin” America, Vol. 185 No. 15 (November 12, 2001) He also wrote a book with colleague, the late Monka K. Helwig:., “Original Selfishness: Original Sin and Evil in the Light of Evolution” (Ashgate, 2006); The issue is whether selfishness was one of the driving forces of evolution. Start there. It’s a simple, but not too simple, proposition. Now I appreciate there are theologians who do not like simple propositions and wander off into complex constructs that have little relationship to how we actually live our lives. I believe that in the Great Commandment(s) and the Last Judgment, Christ made it very simple. In fact he kind of applies Occam’s Razor when he explains the dual commands to love God and Love neighbor and then he says “On these two commandments depend the the whole law and the prophets.” I note that some modern translations have changed the last line. But I like my Confraternity Edition which cost me $1 as a Freshman at CBA Syracuse in September, 1950. That’s very simplistic of Christ isn’t. It? Even more simplistic is the “parable” of the Last Judgment where FOUR TIMES we are told the litany of what we must do to prove our love of God. It is, in the end, it is what we do for “these the least of my brethren.” In my view, both the Great Commandments and the Last Judgment are about the mandate to be selfless and not selfish. In sum, because it’s getting late and I have work to do, I submit the following ridiculously simple equations. Selfishness = Evil Selflessness = Love.

The natural world was a violent place but an animal hunting a prey or a male killing in order to predominate among the females was not sinful. Only the human species can “sin” and ultimately all sin springs from selfishness.

The definition of the Shroud photographs available this far do not allow for a definitive determination of the identity of the “coins” if such they be. A discussion of whose face is on the coins at the time of the Crucifixion seems to me to be irrelevant unless there is unequivocal evidence of the identity of the coins. Your critique of Barrie is misplaced and I doubt with all your experience you are as expert in photography as Barrie, he has a masters degree from the Brooks Institute which was the number photography school this side of the pond. He also photographed the Shroud. The problem with so much of the secondary evidence is that it opens vigorous debates that about evidence that can be ambiguous. The other side of the coin is that all the subsidiary circumstances do point towards the authenticity of the Shroud. As far as the Quantum is concerned, existence at the Quantum level is in fact a mystery that physics has yet to unravel and increasingly the evidence for conscious intervention at the quantum level is increasing, not decreasing. If an individual accepts the Resurrection “on faith” he/she shouldn’t be upset if advances in physics at the quantum lever begin to explain things formerly thought otherwise inexplicable. For example Stuart Hameroff has advanced quantum theories that explain a several phenonema that have been described but derided by skeptics for centuries including Near Death Experiences and point the way to the reality of eternal life.

I don’t mean to be obtuse, but if the Shroud is not the factual, authentic Shroud of Christ. Than any other observations is just words. I believe that it is authentic by applying the standards of proof we use every day of our lives, not just in court. Perhaps also, we might apply e words of Christ rebuking the deliberate obtuseness of the Pharisees and priests: “When you see a cloud rise in the west, straight away, you say, ‘There is a shower coming’ and so it is that a shower comes. And when you see the westwind blow, you say ‘There will be heat’ and then that happens. You hypocrites, you can understand the face of the sky and the earth, but how is it that you can not understand the signs of the times?” Luke 12:54 56 The Shroud of Turin is a sign of OUR times brought to us not by scripture but by science.

However, Jackson’s theory which was expressed in the film as to carbon dating didn’t pan out. Unless, I am mistaken (and I think I am not) the clip was from an film several years old. . Unfortunately, Rogers published a critique of Jackson on image formation in the last century that as we would say in my old neighborhood, “Got Jackson’s dutch up.” As a result, Jackson appears determined to claw at Rogers, and not altogether fairly. His hypothesis on atmospheric carbon didn’t pan out and now, as I understand it, he hypothesizes some reaction caused by the Resurrection. As to the issue of the carbon dating we don’t have to go there. As to the issue of image formation I believe that ultimately we have to. But the issue of carbon dating of a much abused corner of the Shroud is distinct from the issue of image formation. Rogers work on carbon dating was peer reviewed and in the last two years of his life he sought opinions from colleagues and asked them to check his work.

Rogers analysis included threads from the material held back FROM THE CARBON AREA that were retained by Luigi Gonella. His science in that regard was completely peer reviewed. He asked other scientists to double check his work. They did and they concurred. That’s one issue. His ideas on image formation were incomplete as even he realized. Rogers work on the carbon test area was completely transparent. The fact is that he had a hypothesis that even he realized was incomplete when it came to the image formation problem. It is not logical to combine the critique of his incomplete image formation hypothesis with criticism of his documented and work on the threads from the carbon test area. It’s really depressing that people who have an argument with his image hypothesis then feel it necessary to blow smoke about his work on the carbon test site threads. It’s apple and oranges. Logically it is self defeating for one faction to try to discredit another faction on an issue. We should be open to multiple view points. There is no conflict between the proof that the carbon testing area was subject to repairs and that the image formation process implicates the resurrection directly. One, the carbon testing, is directly resolvable by scientific testing of the physical threads. Rogers did that. The other is still a bit over the horizon..","date":"2014-04-30","mins":"6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/28/discovery-promoting-shroud-video-on-feature-about-two-new-saints/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Discovery Promoting Shroud Video on Feature About Two New Saints"},{"id":"comment-173093","author":"john_klotz","post":"I am not sure how Daveb’s comment wound up on this thread, but it is welcome non the less and I will tie it to the video and Charles Freeman. Tomorrow, I will dine with an individual who as a Ph D in History from Princeton and a relationship with my family. She has published and hopefully will not perish. I asked her about History Today and it turns out that History Today is not peered reviewed. Given Charles Freeman’s blather about his research and the attention to the History Today article, I ask Charles a question: Was your article in History Today vetted by a formal peer reviewed process? Yes or no. Second, Daveb’s comment is thorough (as usual) and confines not only the D’Arcis memorandum and the Chevalier Thurston screeds to the dust bin of history but repeats a rather obvious speculation (that Ian Wilson proposed) that whatever D’Arcis was told, the artist was talking about a copy of the Shroud. And as we know, from a very early time after the first exposition, artists started to copy the Shroud. The history of the Shroud after the first exposition indicates the distinct possibility that Shroud had been withdrawn from public view and it is quite possible that the cannons of the Lirey Church were displaying a copy of the Shroud which was after all their bread and butter. But I may hypothesize the wheel. In fact, see the following article by Luigi Fossati published in Shroud Spectrum in 1983: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi08part5.pdf The point is, as Daveb (and earlier Wilson and then Fossati) points out, the Chevalier Thurston hypothesis was itself a hoax. The video posting of the film narrated by Sr. Damien like the STURP report before it and every other peer reviewed publication that I am aware of, annihilates any painting thesis and actually ties together some loose ends. For example why did Nicodemus produce such a large amount of material for the entombment? It wasn’t all meant for the body but to also coat the tomb in a manner that was common to tombs at the time. Watch the video as the mystery is unraveled. (And the Gospel account of Nicodemus’s action substantiated). Also, The Ray Rogers hypothesis on the image formation process is generally supported. Sad to say, the latest victim of the D’Arcis hoax was Charles Freeman..","date":"2014-11-26","mins":"7:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/25/environmental-study-of-the-shroud-in-jerusalem-videos/","cat":"video","title":"Environmental Study of the Shroud in Jerusalem Videos"},{"id":"comment-173281","author":"john_klotz","post":"Outside of the fact that I don’t accept Colin Berry’s latest non authenticity theory, I do believe he is making interesting, provocative, and at times, constructive comments.

It isn’t. The Should is not an academic construct. It is a real object existing here and now. Let me state here and now. If the Shroud is authentic, with the possible exception of nuclear weapons, it is the most important object on the face of the earth. Do you have another nominee? An authentic Shroud confirms the reality of Jesus Christ, his horrible torture and his crucifixion. It also offers circumstantial evidence that support the account of his Resurrection as told in the Gospels. Those are matters of more than “academic interest.” I don’t know what that phrase means on your side of the Pond, but on this side it is more or less synonymous with “hypothetical” or “theoretical.” This is why I think Jesus Christ and his Shroud are of more than hypothetical importance. We are facing the threat of an apocalypse that I have dubbed the “The Apocalypse of Selfishness.” It is the selfishness exploitation of the environment that causes many scientists to project the effective extinction of humanity within 100 years. Jesus Christ is the example of selfish love martyred by the disciples of selfishness. Let me give you a freebie. The last four paragraphs of my book; “The power of the selfish conduct which drove humanity forward through evolution is now driving humanity to extinction. It is in our power to resist that, but our resistance must be through acts of selfless love both collectively and individually. “Humanity may survive another 100 years or perhaps another 100 million. Because of the triumph of selfishness, it may end when the world becomes a poisonous, toxic rock unsuitable for any habitation. Or, humanity could be extinguished when a massive meteorite or asteroid plummets to earth starting a chain of events that will render human life untenable. Whether we, collectively or individually, find our lives overwhelmed by selfish power, we can survive no matter how beleaguered we may feel or become, remembering always that God is love. “Every human being is gifted with that reflective consciousness that removes us from the mundane and opens the path to the eternal consciousness. That will never change. And we have the Shroud that in the words of Fr. Delessi, is “God’s love letter in linen to all mankind.” In this time of peril, let us embrace it. “Joyfully!” If you want to read more.

It seems to be more Mel Gibson than Gospel. Some quick examples. As the the Gibson movie and virtually all medieval art, Christ is shown carrying a complete cross. In reality, crucifixion victims carried “only” the cross bar. But insidious was the presentation of the carbon dating without any explanation of the reason why it has been widely discarded as bad science – the anomalous composition of the place from which the carbon samples were cut. Then it presented without any serious critique the wildly off the track claims of Nicholas Allen that it was a medieval forgery created by a camera obscura. For it to have worked by his process would have required days of exposure in bright sun light. – of a rotting corpse. Yet no evidence of corruption appears on the Shroud. Not to mention the little problem of when was the blood added. Still the program spend precious minutes of air time reenacting medieval forgers working their camera obscura. Also, I believe the Allen “shroud” eventually had its image fade away. Photographically speaking to “fix” the image captured by an emulsion would have required different chemicals. But neither emulsion nor fixers residue appear on the Shroud. Then again we have crown of thorns that was a simple circlet of thorns instead of the cap revealed by the Shroud. More Mel Gibson although his circlet at least had two tiers. This not a complete list. The presentation’s complete ignorance of Benford Marino Rogers and even Giulio Fanti was an tragic omission. I hope to blog on this at some point. Frankly, I have some legal papers to do today and maybe I should cool down. But to see all the resources and publicity wasted on this deeply flawed presentation really is a tragedy. I am reminded of Mark Twain.

As a matter of fact there was a lot of strange things going on at the Vatican that surfaced later. There was an enormous scandal involving the Vatican Bank and Banco Ambrosiano in Venice. The president of the bank, Roberto Calvi, was found hanging from the Black Friars Bridge in London. The press had dubbed him “God’s Banker” because of his Vatican ties.There are some who doubt the suicide (legitimately). Maybe most are doubters. The claim that Pope John I was murdered by Mason’s and Communists is right wing blather. As a matter of fact, Calvi was connected to Propaganda Due a Masonic lodge. However, there is no reasonable explanation of why the Communists would be interested in him. He might very well have carried out John XXIII’s “opening to the left.” The hot rumor which made it into a book was that he intended to loosen doctrinal restrictions on birth control. For insiders in the Vatican, that and his apparent unhappiness with the Vatican Bank was supposed to be too much. Calvi was also tied to a redevelopment of railroad yards in a project in Manhattan called “Lincoln West.” Then Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler (now a congressman and a former client) was told by Trump that the Vatican was behind the deal.
