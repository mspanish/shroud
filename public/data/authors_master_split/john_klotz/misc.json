There may be pseudo science but there is also pseudo skepticism. That is skeptics who claim to be impartially seeking the truth but instead are merely seeking to justify there own view. Perhaps the most prominent pseudo skeptic of our time is Richard Dawkins, author of “The God Delusion.” In the days when the carbon dating provided an easy out for skeptics, Father Rinaldi who did not live to see the results of Ray Rogers’ work stated atht he would not accept the results of the carbon dating until somebody could explain how the Shroud image was formed. That remains the challenge to not just the carbon test belivers, but for all of us. Call be a bliever if you will, but I believe that the mystery of the image will be either solved by science or remain insoluable. Maybe it will never be solved. Or maybe as science pushed further into the quantum enigmas, it might just face a solution that the pseudo skeptics can never accept: It’s Him. I hope youcan recover your audience because the page has performed an important task in its healthy interchanges as contrasted to its braying ones. What the peudoskeptics will never admit is that there is no evidence that will suffice becasue they know the truth and the rest of us are poor, beknighted souls. “Keep the faith,” baby. Really!

I quote Elaine Pagels from her landmark work The Gnostic Gospels: “In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus..","date":"2013-09-26","mins":"8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/24/anglican-vs-catholic-communion-wafers/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Anglican vs Catholic Communion Wafers"},{"id":"comment-45258","author":"john_klotz","post":"Dare I write it again from the not so old but abndoned by the Vatican: “Love makes symbols real.” Thing is, I really believe that.

Although, on he other side of the “coin” there is the problem that occasionally the candles do cause fires. To bring it a little closer to home though, I am not entirely happy with he idea of the Church partnering with Apple for a Shroud App. Also, if you have ever seen one, the pictures of the higher definition pictures of the Shroud taken a few years ago all have a copyright notice for the Archdiocese of Turin.

Throughout history, things which were once considered spiritual have devolved to scientific explanation. Scientific studies have shown “paranormal” or PSI phenomena are real. But, orthodox scientist reject them out of hand because they can’t square such results with there bias against religion. They are “pseudo skeptics.” The takeaway from Penrose is that consciousness is a quantum activity. We shall see where that leads. Consciousness is a key actor in quantum theory. The reason why I closed my blog with John1:1 is quite simple. The “Word” is the primordial consciousness. Thus I would paraphrase it: “In the beginning was the consciousness and consciousness was with God and the consciousness was God.” Darwin was reviled as an enemy of religion. It took Teilhard to harmonize evolution and religion and place them in a divine context. I do not believe in the intelligent design description of evolution. But I do believe that evolution has a direction – consciousness evolving from the alpha to the omega. The best is yet to be. As far as theologians, a quite many of them skip around the physical reality of the Shroud. John Meier in Volume One of a Marginal Jew bemoans the fact that Christ left no artifacts. Really? Sooner or later, the theologians are going to deal withe Shroud and the Quantum Mechanics of existence. I am with Teilhard: neither science nor religion can ignore the other and it is at the quanta the demarcation line vanishes. As far as what the quantum reality of consciousness is, Mitchell describes it as a quantum hologram. And in the Real face of Jesus, Lawrence Krauss another “atheist” notes that many believe the entire Universe is a hologram. I pray that God gives me the time for I am just beginning to understand. I have a question for my physicist source that he should know the answer too, he’s a laser maven. Can a hologram be digitized?

I agree that you can define God out of existence by defining him too broadly. I think the dividing line is “self” consciousness. Teilhard defined the breaking point for humanity from the rest of creation was when the human species attained the power of reflection – self awareness. (As I am sure you are aware – no pun intended). I have said that science can be staring God in the face and never see him. Certainly there is a movement in Christian theology that I believe tends to define Christ out of existence. The Shroud is what brings Him back. Are you familiar with the concept of Boltzmann brains: self conscious entities that pop in and out of existence due to quantum fluctuations? They were theorized by a mathematician physicist at the dawn of the twentieth century. It’s the self conscious part that puzzles me. To define what an atheist is, we have to define what God is. I will make a confession, I do not believe in the Garden of Eden and that God walked and talked with our first parents, nor do I believe in Adam and Eve at all. Neither do I believe that God ordered Joshua to massacre the women and children of Jericho. Does that make me an atheist? It certainly would to some fundamentalists. I have corresponded with a professor at Howard who as written on “original” sin being “original selfishness”, one of the driving forces of evolution. He is not an atheist. Throughout history what once thought to be a divine mysteries have been explained by science and yet mystery remains. I believe that the quantum enigma(s) we encounter are in fact the fingerprints of the creator, who some, including me, define as the primordial consciousness. I also believe that when in comes to self conscious entities, entanglement is love, both literally and figuratively. One summer at a Civil Air Patrol Cadet encampment I meant an aspiring physicist from Albany named, as I recall, Friedman ( his first name may have been Milton, I wouldn’t swear on it). He had won a high school science award building tesseracts – three dimensional representations of four dimensional objects. He decided to build one with me out of soda straws. When we were finished what we had was two cubes connected together at all points by straws at a 45 degree angle. The unmistakable impression was of a cube moving through space. I was instantly reminded of a time lapse photograph of Ted Williams swinging a baseball bat. My god, I thought: Time is the fourth dimension. This was many decades after Einstein, of course, and a few years after I had first read of the concept. I still have a difficult time understanding what I perceive as the passage of time to be what Einstein explained, but the tesseract “speaks” for itself. As to human consciousness, the key is to be sure we are talking about self consciousness. All animate objects including plants have a consciousness, however primitive. The great mystery of human existence is self consciousness – Teilhard’s power of reflection. That the brain is a quantum computer (whatever that is) is a start to greater understanding. I think reading “word” in St. John for self conscious entity is an acceptable metaphor for the God who caused the creation Universe. As far as Teilhard being a pantheist, what does that make one the admirers of his visions, Pope Benedict?.","date":"2012-08-23","mins":"8:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/22/can-our-consciousness-operate-independent-of-time-and-space/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Can our consciousness operate independent of time and space?"},{"id":"comment-50407","author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles, I don’t mean to be modest, but satisfying me will not be the top item on anybody’s agenda.

No matter how de Charny got it, it was on one level stolen property at some point. I believe I saw at one point but failed to note it, that Clement carefully cadged his approval of he Shroud so as not to approve of authenticty claims because the Church was still seeking reunion with Orthodox and a claim that it was an authentic artifact of Christ would engender Orthodox demands for its return. (Which would have by the way made in vulnerable to the Islamists armies who were on the move.) Do you have any thoughts on that. I have a riff on Dawkins in my first chapter because he has a dim view of eye witness testimony and actually prefers solid circumstantial evidence. That’s because in archaeology anthropology there are no eye witnesses. Bias is usually a slur. However, I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag, but it is my opinion that the weight of the circumstantial evidence is authenticity. Can’t defend that in a few hurried, and often typo filled, comments on a blog. But I do not believe that the inability to draw a conclusion from evidence already offered is a disqualification if the mind is open. By the way, by reason of the personal experiences of someone very close to me, I have observed the National Institute of Health (NIH) for two decades. There is fierce competition for grants. Is there fraud by some, you betcha. (Palinease for “You bet there is”) Fraud is NOT endemic. Pride is. The NIH has funded programs of ultimate value far beyond its budget. Overall the NIH is grant program a most valuable and necessary component of US science and one of the bedrock for the US’s scientific and economic progress. You double betcha. Let me say this once in sum. The carbon labs waged a determined effort to keep STURP out of the carbon dating process and to stop any further scientific tests if the carbon date was not within range of 30 CE. STURP had one function in the tests: to select the best sites for taking samples. Because STURP was excluded from the process, the worst possible site was chosen. Surely you must realize that for carbon dating the sample must be typical of the entire object. It wasn’t. But those chapters are already written and I have to move on and not debate it further. My work will speak for itself (if anybody gets to read it). Frankly, I am impressed by the support I’ve gotten. I even have permission from Elaine Pagels author of the Gnostic Gospels to use a long quote from her book (God bless the Internet). I’ll use it now since it is not original with me: It’s from Chapter Two, working title: The Story as Told.” “Then she puts martyrdom in the context of Christ’s passion in words that echo Pasternak: ‘In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life.

Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.'” Finally, show a little respect for those whose opinions differ from you.

As we used so in my adolescence: I wonder who put sand in their Vaseline. By the way, I left out one person who apparently desired the Shroud and searched for it: Adolf Hitler. It was hidden in a monastery under the altar and when the Nazi’s came to monastery to search they found the monks praying around the altar and did not disturb them. They left emptied handed perhaps feeling it was a wild goose chase. I am sorry Charles and Colin, but the Shroud is too important for the Church to surrender it to secular authorities. When it comes to my starting “a stamp on any moves towards retesting campaign” that is precisely what I am not doing. What I am doing is trying to show a path towards testing. However, it has to be non intrusive. You may balk at examining the reason STURP succeeded and look at the naked power play of the carbon labs that destroyed STURP participation as a model, but that is not going to be an appropriate model: Fool me once etc. When it comes to corruption, the corruption of science represented by the carbon testing was gigantic fiasco. By the way, it was not Thomas de Wesselow who first called it that but at 4:441 EST, I am not going to check for the original use of the fiasco label. Secular science flunked the carbon dating. In fact, it’s a template for how it can’t be done. When I publish my manuscript if I ever get it finished you will see why I can write that.

The question I might pose is whether the U.S. FOIA might be an avenue to Arizona’s surviving sample of the Shroud or at least to the raw data that it has thus far refused to publish (that’s the claim).

Donna Campbell wrote that the areas with a different weft and warp interlacement ‘could contain different fibres with different characteristics.’ Ray Rogers identified cotton fibres spiced into a linen yarn confirmed by Robert Villerreal. These cotton fibres were held in place with a crust of terpene. At the conference Robert described to me how the laboratory spent a considerable time examining the crust to determine the presence of terpene. If the terpene solution was a pine oil disinfectant, its gluey nature will have stick fibres to the Shroud material.

He is coming back. If I may change metaphors in mid stream, the Shroud is Christ’s magic carpet which he is riding back into our consciousness. I can envision a magic carpet more readily than a bike as shroud. It’s carpet magically woven by science. I said “coming back.” Now I personally don’t recommend rushing down to to Jones Beach or any other handy open space to await the Rapture. Allegories and metaphors are representations of the truth and not always intrinsically true in themselves. That’s why among fundamentalists there are “pre millenialists” and “post millenialists.” But the decades of scientific study of the Shroud are beginning to register. He is returning to or consciousness in ways previously unimagined. Perhaps prophesied? In Heller’s book, he wrote that after he came into possession of a fiber, he wanted to examine it as closely as possible for blood so he put on his white lab coat and went to his lab where the best equipment was. How about this from Revelations: “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” Revelations 7:14 Are scientists in their white lab coats bringing Christ to us? On the other hand there is Joe Nickell, a man with no scientific credentials per se seeking to debunk the Shroud who loves to pose in a “white lab coat.” “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” Matthew 7:15 20 Can a lab coat also be “sheep’s clothing. That may apply to the carbon labs also. There are many articles on the errors of the carbon dating process, but if you want to see one article that covers the waterfront, I would recommend: Emanuela Marinelli, “The setting for the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud” Valencia Conference 2012, https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf Sometimes it’s tough sorting out the sheep from the ravenous wolves.

I was never very taken with suggestions about divine providence. I was brought up to believe the “lord helps those who helps themselves.” I have also felt, however, that a conversion of science and the Shroud which began at the turn of the last century might indicate that something was at work that might be more than coincidence and that, perhaps, the Shroud has been waiting for science to release its revelation about the reality of Christ.

And imaging a scenario that might have happened ignores the evidence of what did happen. Against hard facts, even circumstantial facts, speculation falls unless supported by hard, not imagined facts (and then it wouldn’t be speculation). One of the things Heller and Adler did is conduct a gedanken (thought) experiment trying to image how the Shroud could have been faked. These very brilliant and accomplished men, one of whom was Jewish couldn’t find any reasonable scenario that could account for the hard facts that are demonstrated by the Shroud. Why do so many people search frantically for explanations which are fanciful and without any historical precedent?

The working title of the whole manuscript is: “The Coming of the Quantum Christ: The Shroud of Turin and the Future of Science and Humanity.” You referenced quite early in your piece “militant atheism.” So “in the clear” are the first three paragraphs of my introduction: “We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Every day we make decisions after weighing the available facts. But almost always we have doubts. Fear the person who has no doubt. Think George Armstrong Custer. If we only acted in the absence of doubt, we would probably seldom act at all. Even Mother Theresa, who devoted her life to caring for the most desperate of the residents of the Calcutta slums, confessed to moments of black doubt. “Unfortunately, one of the hallmarks of the current era are people who profess freedom from doubt under circumstances where doubt would seem to be a reasonable proposition. For example, newly militant atheists are crusading against any form of religion and express no doubt about the absence of any God of any kind. They claim to arrive at their conclusions by the dispassionate application of the scientific method. Foremost among the militant atheists is Oxford Don Richard Dawkins whose literary rant against religion, The God Delusion, has sold more than two million copies since it was published in 2005. The cover jacket for Delusion, modestly describes Dawkins has “the world’s most prominent atheist” (the “atheist pope” so to speak), “Opposed to the atheistic militants are, among others, young earth fundamentalists be they Christian, Islamic or Jewish. To those fundamentalists, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary, the world is a scant 6,000 years old and man walked with dinosaurs. Indeed, to some, the Grand Canyon is but an artifact of Noah’s flood. They are but cat’s paw for the atheistic militants who delight in demonstrating their absurdities. Nonetheless, the most potent weapon of the militant atheists, aside from acerbic wit, is their scientific credentials.” Again, if you want to correspond try klotzlaw@gmail.com.","date":"2013-11-27","mins":"10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"id":"comment-52941","author":"john_klotz","post":"Hugh, You have four accounts of the body being laid in the tomb and that it was missing within three days.

St Paul, I believe, stated that if Christ did not rise from the dead than our faith is in vain. I am not a Greek scholar and I do not know what the Greek word was, but I had to look up vain when I started to write that sentence because I suddenly realized I didn’t remember which way to spell vain. There is of course vein and vane all quite proper words in their own right. But having checked to be sure I spelled it correctly, I was interested in the the definitions of vain I found. 1. Having or showing an excessively high opinion of one’s appearance, abilities, or worth. “their flattery made him vain” synonyms:conceited, narcissistic, self loving, in love with oneself, self admiring, self regarding, self obsessed, egocentric, egotistic, egotistical; More antonyms:modest 2. Producing no result; useless. “a vain attempt to tidy up the room” synonyms:futile, useless, pointless, to no purpose, hopeless, in vain; I don’t know if you took time to read it, but I was particularly struck by Kim Dreisbach’s valedictory read in Perugia posthumously: “The Ecumenical Implications of he Shroud of Turin” see https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/dreisbach4.pdf The reason I was so touched by it is that in sum he stated what has become my conclusion: the Shroud of Turin is a Revelation for our time brought to us by science. To me as a fan of Teilhard de Chardin, that’s huge. That’s epochal. When I started my project and was examining closely the pictures of the Shroud for the first time and reading Barbet and Bucklin, among others, I had what some call a “Shroud Moment.” For the first time in the seven decades my life, I sensed on a personal level what he must have suffered. It’s not that I was in pain, it’s that the reality of that suffering finally sunk in. Christian theology has had trouble grappling with some simple facts of history. There was no garden of Eden and no original sin has we now understand it. My favorite definition of original sin is that it is the innate selfishness of all life that was the driving force of evolution. Scripture tells the story of humanity striving to overcome that selfishness. The antithesis of selfishness is love. I believe hat the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ teaches us that love, in the end, conquers. As Saint Paul wrote: there exist these three Faith, Hope and Love. The greatest of these is Love for in eternity Faith and Hope will pass away while Love shall endure forever. It has been more than a hundred years since Secondo Pia first discovered the meaning and vitality of the image of the Shroud. No one has explained the process of how that image was created. Many have tried. What Colin Berry and the WAG that Dan posted demonstrate is that it is a childish exercise. To paraphrase St. Paul: it’s time to put the childish things aside. Ecce Homo! You may think am avoiding your arguments but I rely on the arguments of scientists like Heller, Adler and the others of the STURP team. These were people of scientific accomplishment before they went to Turin. I’ll take their word. Have you ever examined an actual fiber of he Shroud or do you rely on interpreting pictures taken by others? Do you consider yourself a superior scientist to Ray Rogers?.","date":"2013-11-26","mins":"9:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"id":"comment-52922","author":"john_klotz","post":"At the risk of sounding like someone with faith, which a “true” scientist wouldn’t have, I believe that at the end of the day, the simplest explanation for the image of the Shroud is a process connected to the Resurrection. I also believe that someday “science” will recognize that fact. I think that much of the confusion about the distortions of the image arises from the fact hat the body was not flat at the instant when the image was formed. Forensic pathologists such as Bucklin and Zugibe have found that the body was in a state of rigor mortis. In Chapter 14 of Zugibe’s book “The Crucifixion of Christ: A Forensic Inquiry” he spends a lot of ink discussing “rigor mortis” which he found in the exemplified by the man in the shroud. Between Bucklin and Zugibe there are some disagreement about how crucifixion cause death s but the fact that rigor mortis was present is not in dispute. Zugibe points out that it was necessary for Joseph of Arimithea and whoever else helped him in entombing Christ to “break the rigor mortis” because since the man in the shroud was a crucifixion victim his arms would have stiffened at the moment of death in an extended position. That also meant as frequently pictured that his knees were bent and his head and neck when he was laid flat slightly elevated. Because of that measurement of his actually height has must be adjusted. Now whatever the precise image creation process, it reflects the body still in a position of rigor mortis and that means by the Gospel accounts before 3:00 PM on the Sunday following the crucifixion. All four Gospel accounts describe Mary Magdalene discovering the body missing at daybreak on that Sunday. The rigor mortis is one fact established by science that supports a “theory” of Resurrection and adds weight to the conclusion that the Shroud is not a forgery. It’s just one fact but that fact of rigor mortis is a relevant one. It is interesting but maybe not terribly relevant that the digital pictures I take are sometimes distorted. For example, a picture of my dog Bogart (a/k/a “Bogie”) that I once published on my blog shows his head abnormally large in comparison to his body when he was in a sitting position. Also my wife last night was conversing with her niece in Chicago on Skype using her I Phone. The appearance of her niece’s face close up was also distorted. Her nose for example appeared much larger vis a vis her face. The very distortions that some see in the shroud man are not the result of an “incompetent” artist but likely caused by the time of the image creation when the man in the shroud was in a state of rigor mortis. Now maybe someone can dispute rigor mortis.

However, I have never regarded the historical provenance (since its creation circa 30 CE) to be an issue. To me providence is the interesting aspect of the Shroud. The issue is authenticity and we may never know a complete provenance of the Shroud from time it disappeared from the tomb until it was displayed in Lirey circa 1350 CE and I am really not sure that matters. Martin Kemp is a colleague of yours (I mean a fellow art historian) who made a quite a splash with is involvement authenticating a drawing of a young woman as an original da Vinci. A few years earlier, Christies had evaluated at $20,000 and sold it on consignment. A couple of years later, a new owner showed it to a visitor. He had it stashed in a drawer and the visitor told him that it looked like a da Vinci. Enter Martin Kemp of Oxford, a da Vinci specialist. The known provenance of La Principessa was only from the late nineteenth century at best. He made an exacting scientific examination and determined after that examination that it was a genuine da Vinci and its worth ballooned to over $100,000,000, .let me spell it out: one hundred million dollars. Kemp became the center of a heated debate. His finding was disputed (if not ridiculed) by other experts. He continued his attempts to determine its earlier provenance. He was successful. In Poland he found a folio that celebrated the wedding of a Italian noble’s illegitimate daughter. The noble was a da Vinci patron. She was, as I recall only thirteen and died from complications of pregnancy a few months after her wedding. The folio was bound on the left side. There were holes on the left side of the La Principessa that matched the binding of the folio. It was impossible to determine when La Principessa was removed from the folio, but it was. We (and Kemp) do not know the name of the thief and in what era he operated. However, the discovery of the folio was definitive as to provenance. Not the gaps in possession and provenance that span centuries. Note the deciding factor as holes that matched the binding. Note the acceptance of the La Principessa and the astronomical jump in its evaluation. As far as the Shroud is concerned, Kemp recently wrote a book on icons: From Christ to Coke. He identified the image of Christ as the greatest of historical icons. Alas, he indicated at one point in his book that he was more or less an agnostic. (He kind of let that slip.) It’s my interpretation of what he wrote. He dismisses the Shroud as early Renaissance from the north of Italy or France. He apparently did this a merely a visual observation of photographs of the Shroud. He certainly did not conduct the actual painstaking examination that he did with La Principessa. Seriously, if here is one thing the STURP examinations demonstrated: it was not a painting. I am not ready to write iy today but this episode will be recited in my manuscript. Here’s the important fact. Based on his evaluation, the value of La Principessa was increased by a factor of 10,000 X. And there are still huge gaps in his provenance and there is no chain of title complete from da Vinci’ patron to modern times. Indeed, the determining fact were binding holes in the side of the drawing. Matching holes – there is something about that. Can you think of an analogy? I can, guess what? {I am writing this on the fly. I would really appreciate your prospective on this, or if I misstated anything – in your opinion. I am familiar with your dismissal of the poker holes (which were not poker holes)..","date":"2014-01-09","mins":"8:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/07/keep-it-simple-can-anyone-help/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Keep it Simple: Can Anyone Help?"},{"id":"comment-72747","author":"john_klotz","post":"Keep at it Charles. Your opinions and expertise are valuable. I commend all those who are dedicated to tracking the complete provenance from Tomb to Turin. If it is ever unraveled I am sure that it will be a fascinating story full of interesting characters, some saints, some not so saintly. Recently in my draft which is now up to date and has only the ramification chapters to go, I referred to the resignation of Benedict and the fact that his greatest gift to the Church may have been establishing a precedent for elderly popes to resign rather than clinging to their office even though severely incapacitated. (The idea of the being Benedict’s greatest gift is not original with me but I can’t put a finger on where I read it right now.) Here’s what I have written: “Benedict had been a confident of his predecessor and was at his side throughout his decline. In 2013, Benedict was a year older than John Paul was at the time of his death. There is no reason not to take Benedict’s stated reason at face value and in his resignation he established a precedent for other popes in declining years. The precedent he set may very well be his greatest contribution to the Church. He certainly fared better than the last previous pope to truly voluntarily resign: Pope Celestine XII in 1294. He wished to return to his pre papacy life as a hermit. Alas, Celestine was arrested by his successor and died a papal prisoner” The irony is that after I wrote that and put Chapter 13 to bed, I discovered on a lamp table a book about Celestine. I asked my wife about it. It turns out she had purchased it at Barnes and Noble but hadn’t gotten into it yet: Coincidence, providence, provenance????

I believe it was a Arizona Archbishop who disciplined a nun who was a hospital administrator when she agreed with a medical teams decision to perform an abortion that saved the mother’s life. She should have followed Catholic doctrine and let the mother die. Finally in Brazil, a doctor and a nine year old girl who had been raped by her step father and was carrying twins were excommunicated on Vatican orders for performing an abortion when to carry the child would have resulted in the girl’s death because her body was not developed enough to complete the pregnancy.

For example, I believe I posted a bit on Father Rinaldi including a link to a Sign Magazine article that he wrote in 1934 when still a seminarian in Italy. That article was the beginning of the serious Shroud study in the US for it attracted the attention of many thousands of Catholics including Father Wuenschel who went on to found the Holy Shroud Guild. Fr. Rinaldi who immigrated to he US became, along with Fr. Otterbein, a star in the Shroud world. Rinaldi was probably the single most important person 44 years later in STURP being formed and in gaining access to the Shroud (I don’t mean to gainsay the contributions and organizational talents of Dr. Robert Jackson in writing that). When my book is complete, you will be able to read about it. That chapter is already drafted and has received favorable reviews from those I shared it with privately and who commented. It’s not for publication yet. My digging Rinaldi’s article out of an archive in Pennsylvania got some attention from some very interesting quarters including one across the Pond in GB. I really don’t want to be so defensive about this but I do resent the “loony” part. Has someone profiled me and figured out how to get under my skin? Not that I am paranoid or anything. The working title of my manuscripts is: “The Coming of the Quantum Christ: The Shroud of Turin and the Future of Science and Humanity.” I owe a portion of that title to Dame Isabel Pizek who once said: “The future of science is the Shroud of Turin.” The reason she could say that is ultimately I think she believes as I do, that the issue of the Shroud image will be resolved at the level of quantum mechanics. Now if you want loony, try quantum mechanics. Richard Dawkins, the atheist pope (my description cc) is quoted in the introduction to my manuscript drafted a year ago: “Perhaps there are some genuinely profound and meaningful questions that are forever beyond the reach of science. Maybe quantum theory is already knocking on the door of the unfathomable. But if science cannot answer some ultimate question, what makes anybody think that religion can?” Now that’s loony, or is it?.","date":"2013-01-12","mins":"8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/11/living-free-the-thomas-aquinas-and-pierre-teilhard-de-chardin-part/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Living Free: The Thomas Aquinas and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Part"},{"id":"comment-21935","author":"john_klotz","post":"Gabriel, That is a direct quote from Isabel Pizek. She may have been quoting a European physicist when she said it. I don’t know what your position is on the Shroud or the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The are some who take the attitude I guess of the old song: “How do I know, the Bible tells me so.” Biblical interpretation (exegesis) is not easy and to read the Bible as something dictated by God with human authors playing stenographers doesn’t do justice to the Bible, the putative stenographers or, for that matter, God. If the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, and I believe it is, then the simplest solution to the mystery of its image is the Resurrection. At that point it becomes the most important object on the face of the Earth. I believe that ultimately it will be science that will unlock the mystery of the image and I believe it will be unlocked at the quantum level of existence. (The late Ray Rogers has already been there in one sense, a tiny fingerprint of the quantum is in his calculations.) The quantum, IMVHO is the interface between the primordial consciousness (God) from which our existence sprung at the Big Bang and that existence. The Shroud is a link between science and God. Revealing that primordial existence will be a scientific accomplishment beyond measure. It’s the future of science and religion, the synthesis of which was predicted by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

How many does that represent compared to the number of abortions. The whole point is contraception and health services. Is it not a fact that the number far exceeds the number of pregnant women who receive abortions.? I am not a proponent of abortion as birth control or being used as an excuse to ignore reasonable precautions. Every abortion is a failure. Sometimes the reasons for the abortion arise from natural circumstances beyond the control of the woman, her doctor, her husband or companion. The cases I cited: two in which the Catholic Church penalized individuals who acceded to an abortion where the life of the mother was in stake and one in Ireland where Catholic doctors enforced anti abortion laws and the mother died – as the doctors knew she would. Since you seem conversant with the figures, how many women received health related services from PP WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. That would certainly include health screenings and contraception. I believe the number would be far, far in excess of those who were pregnant. And if PP were a single minded abortion organization, how did those who were pregnant escape its clutches with their pregnancy intact? Could be that PP helped the women carry to term? Do you know? Your statement indicates that many women received pre natal care. Where those women go if PP were defunded? By the way, do you believe contraception other than the rhythm method is immoral? Do you believe all the women who sought contraception aid from PP were immoral? Do you believe that all the women who received cancer screenings and or health assistance were immoral? Do you believe that a doctor who refuses to perform an abortion knowing that the woman would die acted morally? Do you believe that your morality should be enforced on women and doctors by the criminal code? Are you married Andy? Do you have a wife? Have you ever comforted a wife through a difficult pregnancy? Have you ever told a wife, you are going to have to die because of my/our religious beliefs? Since you seek to enforce your religious beliefs through the civil and criminal law on others, these are relevant questions. I see that in response to the furor over the female ordination controversy a single male who was a member of Opus Dei who had taken a vow of celibacy. Don’t you find that a little weird? I do. If a single male can handle celibacy, his place would probably be with the celibate clergy – either brother or priest. By the way, I have never advised a woman to have an abortion. And my advice has been asked. The circumstances are private.

Perhaps the this display gives us common ground so that skeptics or authenticity advocates can make specific reference to one of these photos which are the best definition readily available for discussion. As far as Charles F’s comment, I would say these pictures as well as the issue of the Shroud in general demands a multi disciplinary approach. For example the highest resolution of these photos appears to 64 X in item 5 2. Brown went to more than 3000x for his Scanning Electronic Microscope photographs. While each discipline as some thing to add, each is in its own way is incomplete. We are literally like the blind man and the elephant. Or to turn to another cliche, we have to see the forest that is composed of the trees. The fact is that STURP was multi disciplinary. For example when Machthild Flury Lemberg says there cotton throughout the Shroud was she talking about transients isolated fibers like some of fibers we see in these 32 X or 64 X photos, Or is he talking about something she observed at 3000x with a SEM? Did she use a pocket magnifier? Was the power as high as 32 X? I have my doubts she used 64 X or even 32 X. (OMG, am I a skeptic?)

There were no evidence of pigments in the image itself. Was the “artist” left or right handed? A good art critic or historian can tell. If I ever get my current chapter finished, I will dissect one of the most famous ones as a part of the next and demonstrate how his casual opinion of the Shroud was at odds with his own professional discipline. Trust me on that. “Oh that mine enemy has written a book.” (Not de Wesselow) If I can find his address I will give him a chance to rebut. You will contribute nothing by raising a dead issue. I think an art historian might have something to say about the artistic conventions he might see in the image but the reason for those conventions was the copying of the Shroud itself. If you can show a convention that predates 300 CE or so that contains elements of the Shroud image that might be a start of an interesting conversation but insisting on it being a painting without a shred of evidence other than Mc Crone’s claims which varied by the month then you as big a fool as he was.

I rejoice in the diversity. The Shroud, here and now existent, unites us. Teilhard predicted a merger of science and religion and that is now at the Shroud. That’s why I regard it as a new Revelation (some have called it a Fifth Gospel). To me the enduring command of Christ as recorded in the Gospels is to love one another. Whatever the origins of Christianity, there was a new hymn we sang in the heady post Vatican II days: You’ll know we are Christians by Our Love. Unfortunately we no longer sing it. It’s our challenge to act it.

Essentially, he stripped down the protocols and thus unwittingly sabotaged the scientific authority of the carbon dating. With all due respect that statement that the adopted protocols were the represented the best science available is simply wrong. Protocols recommended in a conference at Trondheim Norway as well as a conference held in Turin in 1987 all called for sampling of different areas to prevent anomalous results. The three carbon labs tested from samples drawn from the same limited area of the Shroud which was in fact anomalous. The exclusion of STURP from the selection process ultimately doomed the carbon dating to failure.

It was the recent You Tube video posted here which explained why such an extraordinary amount was necessary: it was the practice to disinfect or protect the walls with a mixture of such. That work, and the complete preparing of the body, could not be completed before sundown on Friday, the beginning of the Sabbath, because of the lateness in the afternoon of Christ’s death and the fact the body hung on the cross for sometime after his death. The women led by Mary Magdalene were returning at daybreak Sunday to help complete the anointing. Mary looking into the tomb ran and reported to the Apostles; “They have taken his body and we do not where it is. Peter and John (or whoever the disciple Jesus loved was) ran to the tomb and discovered the body was missing and “body bag” was still there. Now Colin adopts and explains the use of the Shroud as body bag (citing Wilson). Maybe at some point, Colin will finally throw in the towel and admit the POSSIBILTY of the Shroud’s authenticity.

Christ hung on the cross after he died long enough for rigor mortis to have set in. There is evidence of dislocation in the shoulders that is consistent with the rigor mortis having been broken. I think Dave B is wrong on this point. I can not envision Christ in a state of rigor mortis being taken down and carried to the tomb arms out stretched rigid from rigor mortis. I can envision after being taken down from the cross, his arms being forced into a position where they were not a hindrance, The breaking was not of bones but of ligaments and muscle in the shoulder, Whether the Shroud was intended for temporary use or not it functioned as a body bag. The truth is that for whatever reason before the preparations of the body could be completed, the Shroud and the body parted company because at daybreak Sunday, the Shroud was found in the tomb but the body wasn’t there.

Is it a snake, a tree, or a wall? My approach, which may seem limited, is to concentrate on two appetites of the Shroud: the body image and the blood. To paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, everything else is commentary. There seems to be a repetitive error that OK addresses: when criticizing the proportions of the Shroud image as being distorted or apart from presumed norm they elide a fundamental aspect of the image. Using a film analogy, the film was not flat and the image was projected askew. Can any one imagine taking a picture with film that is not flat but rumpled and curled? I think OK demonstrated that there had to be distortion. I once posted a picture of my dog, Bogart AKA Bogie taken digitally. There was an immense distortion with his head appearing larger than his body. That doesn’t prove anything except that if the image was created on the Shroud by whatever process and the Shroud was not perfectly taut or the image created at an angle then the image would be distorted. Any photographic expert care to argue with that? Second, a painted copy by an artist is a painted copy by an artist. What one may ask: what was he copying? It appears reasonable that copies of copies of an original object would degrade from the reality of the object. Even photographs when copied degrade with anomalies. That’s one reason why the arguments about what the Shroud shows degrade with the generation of the copy. In the end we are left with an existing physical object in Turin Italy that is traceable to circa 1350. The art historians among us continue to ignore a scientific fact that is actually proven beyond “reasonable doubt.” The Shroud image is not painting. They also ignore another scientific fact: the blood on the Shroud is ancient blood. The D’Arcis memorandum is a hoax and there is evidence that it was elaborated on by Chevalier and Thurston. Thurston adopted Chevalier’s arguments so he is not intellectually culpable. So these are facts about the Shroud that I submit have been proven: the Shroud is not a painting and the blood is real. A final note: one of the egregious errors is the manner in which Shroud skeptics label any scientist whose work they disagree with as a person blinded by religious belief. Alan Adler, who did his work after 1978, was Jewish so was Barrie Schwortz and other members of the Shroud team who were in Turin. According to Schwortz, before the 120 hours of Turin examination in 1978, most of the participants were skeptics of authenticity and expected to find that the image was painted and they could go home. They were surprised. It’s been 36 years, many have passed away. Most that still survive have yet to go home..","date":"2014-12-04","mins":"8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-174632","author":"john_klotz","post":"PHPL: I don’t know if you would thumbs up the following but that’s OK (no pun intended).

The evidence I find decisive is the representation of of burn holes as black rings. Others find other similarities. The Shroud, alone, in contrast to the copies of the Shroud, has actual burn holes with charred edges in the “knights move” configuration. Many of the later copies of the Shroud represent them but they are not actual burn holes but paintings (or drawings) of the burn holes – sometimes as red circles. See the Lier Shroud. That the monk who drew the Pray Codex had artistically challenged ability can not be disputed. As to those who think the burn holes are overly hyped, show me a representation of the Shroud that has real, instead of painted burn holes. The burn holes are the Shroud’s fingerprints.

The issue would be is the scorch an intentional process to create deception, or the result of a “natural process” that still can’t be duplicated accurately complete with the encoded distance information – as first discerned by Vignon over a century ago. And then there is this description of an incident when the carbon dating samples were withdrawn: “When the four floodlights were switched on, pointing toward the ceiling, the sudden increase of light caused an immediate reaction from the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage of Turin, who asked to reduce lighting power to avoid damage to the Shroud.” http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected U.S. President with a slogan “It’s the economy, stupid!” It’s only a hypothesis, but just maybe: “it’s the light stupid.” The problem is if the degradation of the linen was caused “light,” we are a very long way from determining the origin of the light and why it would produce such a perfect image. Or are we? Of course, the claim is some clever medieval forger artist scientific genius did this. I hate to sound like a lawyer, but I am one. Let me use an analogy from law. If someone causes an auto accident and there is a great deal of gasoline spilled that accidentally erupts in fire a few minutes later, he is responsible for the fire. However, if a pyromaniac happens by and throws a match causing the fire, the driver who caused the accident is not liable because you can not legally foresee an act of arson.resulting from the accident. The pseudo skeptics claim the shroud is a fraud because they must intellectually rule out authenticity, whatever the facts are. But forgery is a very complicated, independent process, which has been rebutted and the method of transmitting the image is still not proven. Given what we know, a “natural cause” such as light is much more probable than a forger using unknowable science and anatomical information.

When was the body wrapped in the Shroud and were there two shrouds or burial cloths. As to issue one, I am not sure we can ever have a definitive answer. Colin’s metaphor “body bag” to indicate that he was wrapped when taken down from the cross may seem a bit cheeky but that’s Colin. However, I did not detect, and maybe I read it too quickly an argument for a second Shroud. There’s is no evidence of that. It is absolutely clear that the body was not fully prepared in the time that it was removed from the cross and first placed in the tomb. And before final preparations the body “disappeared.” “39 And Nicodemus also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight. 40 They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 41 Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid. 42 There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.” (John 19: 39 42 (Rheims Duoay Kindle Edition) Because the body was not fully prepared it is ridiculous to claim that scripture, or anything else, supports a second authentic shroud. Also, the concept that Nicodemus brought spices and stuff on a donkey that were twigs and leaves is if you pardon the pun, is made up of “whole cloth.” [I am not sure if that’s an Americanism or Shakespeare but it means “not true.”] By the way, I got an education on Wikipedia from a History professor yesterday who was intrigued by the failed attempt by Charles Freedman to post a pseudo third party Wiki entry as to his History Today theory.

On the other hand, I believe that ultimately the more we learn about consciousness and the quantum and beyond the quantum, the cosmic, the closer we will get to the primordial consciousness entity from which our existence sprang, , that is God,.","date":"2014-06-30","mins":"5:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/30/what-if-jesus-defies-expectations-again/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What if Jesus Defies Expectations Again"},{"id":"comment-134445","author":"john_klotz","post":"Viola? correction I think.

Most often when we apply human logic, it falls short. I do have a feeling that there is something at work with the Shroud. Its survival given the chaos of the eras it passed through is a “miracle.” If the Moslems didn’t get it there are a whole bunch of reformers (Calvin for example) and revolutionists who would have enjoyed assigning it not to the dust bin of history but to a bonfire. The is nothing “miraculous” in Pia’s pictures or in the STURP examinations. Do I detect divine providence in the shroud’s survival until we had the science that would enable us to analyze in depth? You betcha. The final act may very well be science finding and/or admitting that the image could only have been created by a process related to an extraordinary transformation of the body.

How many other preserved objects are there on the face of the earth that have an image in the anatomical detail of the Shroud matching written accounts and traditions? The Shroud is not a tradition. It is here and now and it was, there and then. It is not a legend, myth or allegory. That being said, I do believe that human consciousness, the soul if you will, is a quantum phenomenon and that it has capabilities normally masked by three dimensional reality. One of the most important scienetific breakthroughs in the study of the brain began with a “paranormal event.” It his book, Heller concluded by noting that it all of history and the literally thousands of surviving burial linens there is no other image like the Shroud. Was he wrong? Can someone point out to me a comparable image preserved for centuries, if not millennia, which comes within a country mile of the image on the Shroud? There is an old slightly scatological saying common in some sophisticated circles including Wall Street. “Money talks, BS walks.” Where is the money? Where’s the beef? Where is the physical object that is comparable to the Shroud? So far as I know, and I do not claim universal knowledge of everything, there isn’t any. I am not being snide. I really would like to know.. The Shroud is my opinion is a capital R Revelation, providentially preserved to a time when science could unlock it’s secrets. The Revelation is unfolding before our very eyes. How lucky are we. And how lucky were the men and women of STURP. I mention providence. That the STURP examination came to be was such a collection of circumstance and accident, that it can only be accounted for with a capital P Providence..","date":"2014-02-14","mins":"6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/13/what-things-would-not-be-known-until-800-years-into-the-future/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What things would not be known until 800 years into the future?"},{"id":"comment-194255","author":"john_klotz","post":"Can we project 2 million eventual visits?.","date":"2015-03-24","mins":"5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/24/with-a-month-or-so-to-go/","cat":"2015","title":"With a month or so to go"},{"id":"comment-36016","author":"john_klotz","post":"A few days a go I quoted from Bob Dylan, without attribution: “You don’t have to be a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing.” I might add a second Dylan quote now by way of Peter, Paul and Mary: “The answer, my friends, is blowing in the wind.” Barrie Schwortz noted in Shroud.com that his hits in March were 160,000, triple what is normal. Burt Bacharach began a song I have always liked but which never became a hit, and except for its first line has no relevance but I think that first line is most appropriate for our time, and place: “Sail, when the wind start to blow.” I believe the Shroud is a Revelation reserved for our scientific times.
