[{"id":"comment-8362","author":"artscience","post":"I’ve always been curious about those two strands of hair coming down from the hair line ….it seems quite widespread in depictions of Jesus from 500 onwards, but looking at the Shroud, they are not the most obvious of features. I’m looking at the picture of the Shroud’s head via the Shroud Scope (cool name!) viewer http://www.sindonology.org/shroud Scope/shroud Scope.shtml and can just about make out two darker areas (on the negative image) in the middle at the hairline (one strand of which leads into the blood stain shaped like a reflected 3). Is this what inspired the two strands to appear in the depictions? Not exactly damning evidence, but intriguing. A good trick from my artist days, if you want to see broad tonal differences and not be distracted by details, is to squint through semi closed eyelids…then I can just about see the two strands or at least vaguely convince myself I do..","date":"2012-02-16","mins":"3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/more-over-at-stephen-jones-blog-on-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"image_theory","title":"More over at Stephen Jones’ blog on the Vignon markings"}]
