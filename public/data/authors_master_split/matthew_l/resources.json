Assuming it is authentic of course It proves Jesus existed, but we already know that. It proves he was crucified, but we already know that. It proves he was buried, but we really already know that was likely anyway. It nearly proves the empty tomb, but again we already know the empty tomb is likely. So I think what the Shroud does best is further the case for the reliability of the Gospels, and bring up some interesting thoughts about the Resurrection like why do the blood stains look how they do why is there no clear evidence of manual extraction? Then of course the image and what caused that. Is it a byproduct of the Resurrection? BTW, that image in this post could easily be replaced with “something natural happens”..","date":"2015-10-31","mins":"2:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/31/proof-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","title":"Proof of the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-210223","author":"matthew_l","post":"Why all the fuss about this man? Because it is Jesus of Nazareth the man who billions worship, love, hate etc. All around the world. Its also a man who was rumored to have been Resurrected and we have his burial cloth and there is a mysterious image. Obviously, I think the shroud is authentic but its not hard to find out why there is so much interest in THIS burial cloth. With that being said I do think we should look into the “Jospice Mattress Imprint” and while I haven’t looked into it much I know what it is, and i’d like to know more..","date":"2015-09-12","mins":"3:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/12/new-barrie-schwortz-podcast/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"New Barrie Schwortz Podcast"},{"id":"comment-215299","author":"matthew_l","post":"“What happens when it comes to New Testament archaeology?

I talked w/ New Testament Scholar Dr. Ehrman briefly on the shroud recently… (First) Me: Hey Bart, i’m wondering what your thoughts are on the shroud of turin? I’ve studied it for awhile, and I think its authentic. Bart Ehrman: I’m afraid there is little doubt that it is a medieval forgery (Second) Me: Last question on the Shroud Mr. Ehrman. What If I told you there was real blood on the Shroud? What if it held a real human corpse at one point, and has forensically accurate wounds that match Jesus to the most shocking degree? Would you think about it again? Because this is exactly what the evidence shows on the shroud. Bart Ehrman: Sorry– I think you should read scholarship on the Shroud, what the scientists actually say, not the popularizers. Me: It is what the scientists actually say. Pathologist, Blood chemist, chemist etc. I’ll give you a list of some of them..Robert Bucklin, Frederick Zugibe, Ray Rodgers, Alan Adler, John Heller, Kelly Kearse, Yves Delarge, Pierre Barbet, Paul Vignon, Sebastiano Rodante, Pierluigi Baima Bollone, Rudolf W. Hynek, Giovanni Battista, Judica Cordiglia, Gilbert Lavoie, Pierre Merat etc. Atheist, agnostics, jews, and christian all within this list. Its an uphill battle when it comes to the shroud, but truth will come through sooner or later, and all I want is for people to do a thorough research on the shroud, and examine all the evidence not just dismiss it out of hand because the c 14 dating. Something Bart clearly hasn’t done, and has done. On another note once you are a shroud proponent and you look back at Isaiah 53 and some other prophecies…..WOW..","date":"2015-09-23","mins":"12:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/22/recent-interview-with-russ-breault/","cat":"video","title":"Recent Interview with Russ Breault"},{"id":"comment-211000","author":"matthew_l","post":"No, he doesn’t seem to have really researched the shroud much..","date":"2015-09-23","mins":"12:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/22/recent-interview-with-russ-breault/","cat":"video","title":"Recent Interview with Russ Breault"},{"id":"comment-211538","author":"matthew_l","post":"I didn’t read the whole thing, but it seems to me like she is a proponent of the Thomas de Wesselow theory for the Turin Shroud, and the Resurrection which always makes me roll my eyes.

This was a helpful post. I had the impression that the Christ Pantocrators and coins etc. And their connection to the Shroud depended on the Image of Edessa, but your post seems to be saying there could have been a completely different cloth that is responsible for the Pantocrators, and coins. For the Mandylion and it just being a face isn’t there an explanation for that? Wasn’t the Turin Shroud folded so just the face was visible? There does seem to be obvious folds on the turin shroud, and it can be folded in such a way to look like the Mandylion..","date":"2015-09-30","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/22/recent-interview-with-russ-breault/","cat":"video","title":"Recent Interview with Russ Breault"}]
