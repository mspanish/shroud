[{"id":"comment-213787","author":"matthew_l","post":"Hugh it seems to me like relying on the C 14 dating to show the Shroud is medieval is a house built on cards much like Richard Carrier’s hypothesis that Jesus didn’t exist is built on a house of cards…For example.. 1.) You need the pray codex to not be connected to the Shroud despite decent evidence (modestly) that it is… 2.) You need the Sudarium of Oviedo to not be authentic when there are studies/observations that would indicate that is connected to the Shroud… 3.) You need the repair hypothesis that has been put forward and defended in multiple peer reviewed papers and has been put forward and defended by textile experts, chemist, other scientist etc. To be dead wrong with no basis in truth 4.) You need all the Coins that appear to be connected or based on the Shroud before the dating range to be mere coincidence 5.) You need the Christ Pantocrators to not be based on the Shroud despite a clear congruence between them, and the Shroud. Etc. Etc. Etc. It seems to me like the dating of the Shroud should be an open question. There is evidence that the dating is wrong, and certain details or evidences that point earlier..The dating should be considered, but not much more then that. It is not proof or hard evidence for anything. If skeptics on here, and elsewhere always need additional independent test on topics like Aragonite, Shroud blood type, and the like I would think to be fair skeptics on here should demand additional independent tests on a carbon dating this is very controversial and indeed questionable before making claims that it shows the Shroud is medieval..","date":"2015-10-28","mins":"9:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/28/banding-proves-cloth-was-not-repaired/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Banding Proves Cloth Was Not Repaired?"},{"id":"comment-213845","author":"matthew_l","post":"“None of this will seem relevant to this site as no one accepts that the Shroud was once a painted linen.
