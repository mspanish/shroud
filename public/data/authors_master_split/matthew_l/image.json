(Long answers allowed of course) Does the 3 D information/data in the shroud confirm there was a real corpse or at least a real 3 D object in the shroud? Is the image area darker for parts of the body which would be closer to the cloth (nose, hands, feet etc.) ? And lighter for the parts farther away? (eye sockets, neck etc.) And does this show there was a real body in the shroud?.","date":"2015-09-27","mins":"1:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/27/more-3d-discussion/","cat":"3d","title":"More 3D Discussion"}]
