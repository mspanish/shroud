I first draw his attention to the Saint Lawrence and Turin Shroud issue as early as February 2013. – First on February 25, 2013 at 3:43 pm, in CB’s blog, I wrote half seriously half tongue in cheek: “Le terme de graal est traduit en anglais par « grail » – le saint graal : the holy grail. Or graal se rapproche du terme de vieux français « grail » qui signifie gril et grille – car les deux mots ne sont différenciés qu’au XVIIème siècle – du latin cratis (grille, claie). Le verbe « griller » était orthographié « graailler », remarquez les deux « a ». On retrouve le gril dans un récit irlandais racontant l’évolution de Tuân mac Cairill réalisant l’Homme primordial en lui. If you still don’t know the optical reason why YOU THINK YOU SEE “un homme grillé à petit feu” just pray Saint Lawrence for it… and Saint Cecil too…” – Then on October 16, 2013 at 9:53 am | #12 Reply | I first wrote in DP’s blog: “Re CB being the victim of a pareidoliac “semblance et avision” is another good example of RE EXPERIENCED archaeopareidolia…” “Actually the first “CRYPTIC SYMBOLICAL” rendering of the vision” of a man been roasted while the observer was looking at the burial Shroud (now kept in Turin) dates back to the first half of the 5th C. CE (see the Maryrdom of St Lawrence mausoleum of Gallia Placidia, Ravenna). Many Turin Shroud data are here YET ciphered. There is another late 11th early 12th Shroud like cryptic Martydom of Saint Vincent/Lawrence being roasted on a grate by Benedictine Abbot mural artist, Hugh of Cluny (1049 1109) (see his designed programme of mural paintings in the Cluniac chapel of Berzé la Ville in Burgundy). Actually Saint Vincent and Saint Lawrence are currently mistaken one for the other. ” – Then again on October 16, 2013 at 10:08 am | #14 Reply | and October 19, 2013 at 10:15 am | #53 Reply |: “Notice in the Ravenna mosaic the most intriguing characteristic of Saint Lawrence’s grate: it has wheels! Actually the two small wheels cryptically feature two of the four roundish water stains in conjunction with the series of burn holes one can still see on the TS.” “Actually, in the Ravenna mosaic the gridiron grate leg rings (about 5cm in diameter) are about twice smaller in diameter than expected and look more like small wheels. Now the water stains in conjunction with the 4 series of symmetrical burn holes on the TS, are about 5cm in diameter too. This is both a spy clue and a de rhyming pattern in the composition.” “Most likely the original size of the bloodied body long burial cloth (TS) was 111x436cm not 113x444cm, present size. Hence folding shall be adapted to get about 28x27cm square folding marks all over the cloth surface (and conjure up a pareidoliac grate image in conjunction with roundish water stains as pareidoliac wheels and blood belt as pareidoliac raging flames).” – Then again on October 16, 2013 at 5:24 pm | #23 Reply |, I wrote in DP’s blog: “(…) can you (Dr. I. Colinsberry) “scientifically” recognized a naked Templar by means of the head on the Lirey Pilgrim badge? Is that what you call circumstantial evidence? A medieval observer taking a look at the Lirey Pilgrim badge, would have either recognized the Holy Shroud or mistaken the naked man for Saint Lawrence or Saint Vincent (not a Knight Templar)”. – Then again on October 16, 2013 at 5:30 pm | #26 Reply |: “Addendum rearding Dr. I.

It was just a typo in my previous comment on this thread not to mention myrrh. The fact is, besides light or pre mordanting and maybe “trapped biluribin”, carbon monoxide present in myrrhic aloetic fumes –acting as an archaeological blood intensifier– could account for the TS man’s archaeological red (carmin mauve) blood looking as if it had just been shed the day before. Re the “infinitesimal splinters of hard wood found near the wound areas”, oak particles were found in the Turin Shroud fibres and the occcipital area. In the present state of Shroud research, it is difficult to say whether the micro fragments come from the wood caskets in which the Shroud has been kept for many centuries. E.g. Those from the occipital area of the Man on the Shroud should be compared to a micro fragment of (a relatively large piece of) the True Cross housed at Sainte Chapelle in Paris, France.

Re the different possible approaches to the TS image formation process and how my own approach is really original, on another thread I wrote: “I’m neither a “fraudulist” (the TS image is a fake or a “make believe”) nor a “miraculist” (the TS image is supernatural) or a “naturalist” (the TS image results from a real corpse first left about 36 hours at “cave tomb”/room temperature) or even a “survivalist” (the TS image is that of a man that has survived crucifixion) but a “halakhist” ( > Halakha = the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah) that is my opinion as a professional cryptologist is the TS image formed on burial as the Second Temple period buriers most likely subjected the tightly wrapped up corpse to a (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation to make up for the anointing procedure that could not be performed on that very shabbat eve for lack of time for grinding the spices and making spicy perfume oil from myrrh and aloe wood in solid blocks or lump shape. My approach leaves open the door to a return to life first in flesh and bones, whether miraculous or not. Indeed it is too bad for the archaeological and scientific truth the Shroud literature mostly if not solely highlights the (arch )fraudulists’ and (arch )miraculists’ totally biased opinions.” The fact is I first had “an inspired guess” just the night just after reading the Heller report late in 1988 CE (I had only very remotely heard of the TS until then). Not until 1994 CE I really put my TS image formation fumigation/pre or light mordant theory pen to paper based on my first attempt to reconstruct Yeshua’s tetanised body/stiff rigid corpse wrapping in shrouds in light of Christolipsology (studies and research on Christ’s contact relics). My two research paper resumes (“La Soluzione Archeologica Dell’Enigma O Verso Una Nuova Orientazione Delle Ricerche Sulla Generazioe Dell’Imagine Sul Lenzuolo Mortuario Di Torino” and “Decriptazione Ex Novo Delle Tace D’Iscrizioni Sul Lenzuolo Mortuario Di Torino E Messa In c Correlazione Col Frammento Del “Titulus Damnationis” Conservato In Roma”). Unfortunately, the day before the presentation of my oral papers, I was told I would be allowed only seven minutes to present my findings because they were too many orators. Overnight I rewrote a paper in French “En Vue De La Solution Archéologique De l’Egnime” and only tackled the Yeshua’s burial time frame issue. Not until 2010 CE, I very succintly presented my fumigation/pre /light mordant theory in a paper I addressed to Lazzaro after the International Workshop on the Scientific Approach to the Acheiropoietos Images held in Frascati Italy. Since I had no time to British English edit the paper in wrote in haste while working on my profesional files and the three referees (Lazzaro, Murra and Albright) were arch miraculists and had not the foggiest notion about the possible use of the Red Heifer ashes to purify shed innocent blood (Yeshua’s) and could not really discriminate between falsely positive optical illusion (or “I think I see what it not really there”) and falsely negative optical illusion (or “I think I don’t see what is really there”) (A real shame!) my paper “Does the Shroud of Turin Really Bear the Image of a Man Crucified “Under Pontius Pilate””? was rejected..","date":"2015-07-31","mins":"4:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It"},{"id":"comment-207002","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: a (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation to TEMPORARILY make up for the anointing procedure that could not be performed on that very shabbat eve.","date":"2015-07-31","mins":"4:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It"},{"id":"comment-207027","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: “Decriptazione Ex Novo Delle Tace D’Iscrizioni Sul Lenzuolo Mortuario Di Torino E Messa In c Correlazione Col Frammento Del “Titulus Damnationis” Conservato A Roma”.","date":"2015-07-31","mins":"7:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It"},{"id":"comment-207006","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Most lilkey too the Johannine “soudarion” is neither the Oviedo Sudarium (pre burial face cloth) nor the Cahors Headdress (burial skull cap) or the Manoppello Veil (burial face cloth now reduced to more than half its size and touched up) but the Kornelimünster Sudarium (all envelopping burial wrap, Hebrew sovev, Aramaic soudara)..","date":"2015-07-31","mins":"5:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It"},{"id":"comment-207004","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Most likely his burial sindon was no longer in the empty tomb since Yeshu’a worn it draped about his body from head to knees when he appeared to Mary Magdalene..","date":"2015-07-31","mins":"4:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/27/and-we-are-all-mathematician-even-if-we-dont-know-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And We Are All Mathematician Even if We Don’t Know It"},{"id":"comment-207036","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Which autorities exactly?

The TS bloodied body image is the result of a self collimated light mordancing extended to the back and front of the stiff rigid corpse of the crucifixion victim. And on April 30, 2015 at 10:56 am I also wrote: “(…) methinks the crucifixion victim’s ‘smooth wet and dust covered textile skin’ (or ‘second skin’ aka his aqueous alkali solution in soaked inner winding burial sheet now known as the Turin Shroud), tightly moulded over his dust lactic acid residue freshly dried blood covered body, acted as an image enhancing membrane for accurately aligning (collimating) compressible and decompressible vapour flow and orthogonally moved in terms of body to cloth gradual drying/shrinking and unsticking front and back by means of the said flow as a thermal actuator.” Reminder: Whether it be 3 D printing of a crucifixion victim body between two sheets of an ancient linen cloth, small sprigs of fresh herbs, the fresh individual flowers and/or freshly caught fishes between two sheets of (blotting) paper, such a process requires moulding by either manually rubbing, pressing or compressing crests and valleys between the said sheets, moistening or remoistening (through a moisturizing ingredient as liquid medium) AND drying (in terms of external and/or internal thermal source). Note: Ammonia and/or lactic acid is present in eccrine sweat and urine and lactic acid is also produced through fermentation of plant derived carbohydrates and is an excellent moisturizing ingredient. Even in the case of the Jospice matteress cover image case, besides prolonged exposure to moisture from sweat, urine + gradual drying through pre and/or post mortem hyperthermia and/or well heated hospital room, compression is involved (see Zubige: “a significant amount of weight was exerted on the hand from the weight of the body on the hand and in the shoulder area, the weight of the head on the lower part of the face area and on the shoulders”). Besides to claim the TS man’s stiff rigid blodied body was not FIRST compressed (in shrouds) and had no contact and acted at a distance (up to 4 cm) to yield a 3 D imprint with minor distortions, is not only contrary to the Gospel accounts (Yeshu’s was wound, compressed fastened in his shrouds), to Judean funerary customs, pratices and rites but to facts of experience as well (the Volckringer patterns, Gyotaku images and Jospice matteress cover irrespective of the Antinoë Veil).”.","date":"2015-06-29","mins":"5:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/extreme-blogging/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Extreme Blogging"},{"id":"comment-204054","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Methinks it is not so much body to cloth proximity than body to cloth duration of contact time due to the gradual sticking unsticking process that shoud be taken into account in terms of bloodied body imprint volumetric recording on the inner side of the alkaline water based solution in soaked sindon/himation used as a purifying long inner burial winding sheet..","date":"2015-06-29","mins":"9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/extreme-blogging/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Extreme Blogging"},{"id":"comment-204058","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: sticking and gradual unsticking process.","date":"2015-06-29","mins":"10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/extreme-blogging/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Extreme Blogging"},{"id":"comment-204023","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Thibault wrote: “this imprint is very special.

To claim there was “no contact” and the TS image image results from an “action at a distance” force is misleading per se to say the least and totally biase the whole enigmatic image formation process issue. Plain common sense (or is it the Infinite Intelligence of L Ife?) tells me the TS bloodied body imprint most likely results from a contact and gradual loss of contact formation process in conjunction with an external thermal source (with or without body hyperthermia). Most likely the sindon/himation used as an inner burial linen cloth was in soaked with an alkaline water solution and thus providentially sort of “prepared” through halakha (Judean religious law here in terms of funerary customs, rites and practices) for transferring the dorsal and ventral imprint of the Jerusalem limestone & Judean desert dust & lactate residue covered bloodied body to the inner surface of the fabric on taharah (the latter in terms of wrapping in ritually clean shrouds –an alkaline water solution in soaked inner burial winding sheet and smaller dry outer shrouds + a much larger dry “all enveloping shroud” or sovev in Hebrew, sudara in Aramaic– and subjection to aloetic fumigation to make up for the anointing procedure and dry out the body). Methinks a change of paradigm is much needed indeed to get out of the alleged “scientific” dead end that tends to misleadingling promote “archmiraculism” and “archfraudulism” at the expense of plain common sense as far as funerary and forensic archaeologies are concerned..","date":"2015-06-29","mins":"1:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/extreme-blogging/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Extreme Blogging"},{"id":"comment-204024","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: as far as funerary and forensic archaeologies + archaeological bloodstain analysis are concerned.","date":"2015-06-29","mins":"1:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/extreme-blogging/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Extreme Blogging"},{"id":"comment-204027","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder: On June 9, 2015 at 10:24 am, I wrote in the hypothesis the TS man is Yeshu’a: “As a victim of a violent death, Yeshua’s body should be buried with his shed innocent blood and his POST MORTEM blood could not be DIRECTLY cleansed.

Re the alleged “absence of distortions” in conjunction with the cloth as flat surface: the true fact is the Sindon image is affected by several distortions: to the sole exception of the bony areas of the eye sockets and nasal septum, all the rest of the face shows irregular features and displacements; two squared ‘U’ shaped boxes frame up the Shroud face; absence of a neck image along with presence of chin lower area (vertical panoramicity); unusually long adducted abducted arms (of which rigor statuaries, “statuar rigidity”, was counter acted) and seemingly long fingers on the right hand (implying both dislocation and uneven stretching at the arm level). Along with head slightly bent forward, curved back and legs bent with raised knees, non flattened buttocks and calves all these distortions ordeparture fromthe geometrical norm do point in one direction: a volumetric recording of a moulded stiff rigid bloodied body with at least two slightly different body to cloth configurations (initial and final). I repost what I posted on another thread: Daveb, In the hypothesis the TS man is Yeshua’s, the latter was buried according to the JUDEAN burial custom, which implies to abide by a series of specific procedures. In the Second Temple period any corpse should be purified, dried out, dressed up/wrapped up in clean shrouds/burial cloths and speedily buried to abide by the halakha. Those were the core procedures. If some may fall in your most curious ‘take and leave’ interpretative line, here are a few additional reminders and questions for you: Reminder one: The actual maximum time frame (between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath) for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. His burial was NOT dispatched in less than half an hour as it is currently yet wrongly claimed. Yossef Ha Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), DID NOT wait until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him at the risk of not abiding by the halakha and dishonouring his master’s memory! Just bear in mind too Yeshua was buried in the memorial tomb of Yosseph, a rich man, and not just thrown into a pit as a criminal. The rich man and secret disciple used the sindon/hemation he HAD bought for his own burial and used his newly hewn own garden tomb near by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus both did abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to the burial and honour his master’s memory. Speedy burials’ is the norm as far as Jewish/Judean funerary customs, practice and rites are concerned NOT the other. Reminder two: The 3 different conjugated koine Greek verbs used by the 4 evangelists meaning bind/fasten – compress/wrap up – wind/encircle and the koine Greek word for ‘shorter shrouds/pieces of linen’ (othonia) do imply Yeshua’s body was tightly wrapped up in shrouds not just draped over or loosely bound for the women to wash, anoint and tightly wrap up his naked body in shrouds at the first morning hour of the first day of the Hebrew week, that is just after the Shabbat, on the third day of Yeshua’s death. Most likely the stiff rigid body tightly wrapped up in shrouds (along with flower heads, ferocious thorns –used as stitches to hold the shrouds together– and even objects and tokens?) was encircled widthwise in a much larger “all enveloping shroud” or sovev in Hebrew, sudara in Aramaic (the Korneilmünster Shroud = the Johannine “soudarion”?). Reminder three: Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking gradual unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner burial sheet soaked in an aqueous alkali solution (made of living or rainwater + ashes and/or limestone dust) and tautly drawn lenthgwise back and front from head to toes, was compressed widthwise with shorter dry clean shrouds (othonia) as ALL PARTS of the body should be wrapped up (see Naḥmanides, Torat ha Adam; Inyan ha hoẓa’ah) and then, most likely, the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse was subjected to fumigation (see see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum) and the long inner burial sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up.To his likley five six buriers and (secret) disciples Yeshua was no am ha arets (“average citizen) but a prophet (and even the Messiah) whose freshly dried innocent blood had been shed, and should be kept with his body and purify. In the case here under study, Second Temple period speedy tahara in terms of wrapping in shrouds, purifying & drying out was an act of ultimate kindness to honor the deceased who died a violent death. It shall not be mistaken with careful physical cleansing Jewish/Judean ritual of a NON bloody body.The (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation rite temporarily made up too for the anointing procedure that could not have been performed on burial since grinding spices was not allowed on shabbat to prepare spicy oils. Actually the women came back to Yeshua’s tomb after shabbath JUST TO ANOINT/apply the spicy oil perfumes to his wrapping shrouds (NOT TO WASH, ANOINT AND tightly WRAP up his naked body in shrouds as it is currently misthought). In the koine Greek Gospels, do you really read Yeshua’s shroud was just draped over or loosely bound? And, besides anointing, do you really read the women were to wash and tightly wrap up Yeshua’s body in shrouds/linens clothes on Sunday morning? Why the wrapping in shrouds/linen clothes SHOULD be read as ONLY metaphoric in the Gospels while the anointing procedure the women were about to perform on Sunday Morning SHOULD be read as referring not only to FACTUAL anointing to be but also to FACTUAL washing and wrapping to be (had Yeshua’s body be still in the tomb)? This implicit interpretative line makes no sense a tall. Reminder four: As a victim of a violent death, Yeshua’s body should be buried with his shed innocent blood and his post mortem blood could not be DIRECTLY cleansed. The use of alkaline solution along with (myrrhic )aloetic fumigation) could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now these two signals precisely tend to prove the body could have been purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial custom/practice. The true archaeological fact is there is more than one way by which blood could have become depleted of key ingredients if one considers the bloody body purifying & drying ritual scenario, which Adler clearly did not (crucifixion being an implicit assumption in all his discussion at the expense of specific burial practices, rites and customs). It is light years’ far from proven yet the burial cloth was just draped about or loosely bound the TS man’s body and the image recording implies JUST ONE body to cloth configuration. YOUR interpretation is plain conjecture not mine. Mine is substantiated as far as forensic archaeological textile imprint and bloodstain pattern analyses, Judean/ancient Jewish burial practices and Biblical and Gospel accounts are concerned. Now you’re totally in denial the TS bloodied body front and back image recording calls for at least TWO DIFFERENT cloth to body CONFIGURATIONS (one resulting from tightly moulding/compressing the relief of the corresponding area with the linen cloth –in soaked most likely with a watery solution– and another resulting from the gradual shrinking of the cloth while getting somewhat taut again front and back and unsticking –through a drying procedure and a resulting pressure release front and back), how then could you account for only one body to cloth configuration or in other words how could you account for: 1/ the correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3 D structure of a human body? 2/ the discrepancy between the apparent location of some bloodstains on the cloth versus the body image and their real location on the corpse, e.g. The oozing APPEARING to be in the hair image when actually it was first recorded at cheek level? 3/ the fact that, to the sole exception of the bony areas of the eye sockets and nasal septum, all the rest of the face shows irregular features and displacements. Reminder here: – most likely the TS man’s face was compressed by a sindon, sweat veil and skull cap (not to mention the possible use of a smal “jaw box” made of three wooden pieces to keep the mouth closed, see my reconstruction). Now a forensic examination of the nose area reveals that in this operation the cartilaginous or fleshy rounded part of the nose would have been squashed. Actually the Sindon face tells us this area is not only squashed but also turned to the left with the TS man’s face right profile appearing as if embedded in his facial image. 3/ the very fact the small of the back is recorded (despite lordosis) while the image at buttock level (upper thigh area) is not, which is not consistent at all with Mario’s explanation? 4/ the left thigh image being LARGER than expected compared to the right thigh one? 5/ neither the backside image nor the calve images (of the anatomical left leg bent a little more than the right leg) appearing flattened but round AS IF these areas were ‘elevated’ AWAY FROM underlying shroud? Do you really advocate levitation? Reminder here: The very fact the buriers took great care not to disturb the blood is totally consistent with an ancient Judean/Jewish burial custom in terms of corpse covered in blood tahara (purification ritual). It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. Re the backside gap, the latter JUST CANNOT be explained “by either the distance of the cloth from the body, […] or possibly by packing with flora or spices.” There is a visual body image discontinuity most likely due to a “S ease fold”. 6/ the presence of some scourge marks at popliteal fossae (back of the knees) level while there is no back of the (partially flexed) knee images? Reminder here: Miller and Pellicori UV photos do show that there are scourge marks and yet no (or next to no) body image (this in conjunction with an air gap). The eye brain coordination system has somehow “to fill the anatomical/air gap” (see Fanti’s most circumlocutive prose misleadingly describing the scourge marks “in correspondence to lower luminance levels of the body image”, A69 in Evidences for Testing Hypotheses about the Body … ) In the light of the general economy of the TS man HD bloody body image, such paradoxical visual evidence is consistent with: a/a blood comes first body image second scenario b/creation of an air gap as the (watery solution in soaked) long inner burial sheet (TS) first stuck to the body (hence the mirror image of blood transfer by direct contact) and then somehow got taut (too rapidly for the popliteal fossae to be correctly recorded and 3 D encoded). 7/ the unusually long arms and seemingly long fingers on the right hand image imply both dislocation ( and uneven sindon stretching at arm level? During the image formation process, the tightly pulled and compressed in soaked long inner burial sheet didn’t quite return to its natural size and shape as it got sort of taut again lengthwise through shrinking (through drying out). The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from adduction to abduction thus creating sort of a stiff rigid arm counter pressure to shrouds’ wrapping up pressure. Through drying out and slight cloth to body pressure release as the Shroud got somewhat taut again through shrinking, the arms mechanically tended to slightly raised again above body. It resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint. Yes indeed, in the light of the TS bloodied dorsal and ventral body imprints and the three other Gospel accounts, John 19: 40 can read: “Then they took the body of Yeshua, and wound and compressed and fastened it in linen shrouds with the spices, as the manner of the Judeans is to bury”..","date":"2015-06-09","mins":"10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"id":"comment-201410","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Moons ago = on May 29, 2014 at 8:52 am i.e. More than one year ago!.","date":"2015-06-09","mins":"11:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"id":"comment-201439","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Daveb, The fact you just cannot substantiate your opinion speaks volume against it (you cannot even account for most of the TS image gaps!). I myself studied projective geometry in high school (Technical Drawing & Design lessons) for two years and was a stone cutter and carver (soft and hard stone) for one year at the CFC des Compagnons du Tour de France, Nantes, France. I can think 3 dimensionally all right, thank you. The TS man’s body was compressed in his shrouds (first configuration), that’s a fact you cannot deny unless you believe in a supernatural image formation process and you are in denial of optical facts as far as archaeological bloodstain patterns are concerned. How can you deny for instance the TS man’s face or torso or legs was/were compressed front and back is just beyond me! How do you account e.g. For the very faint back PARTIAL blood image found of the face (maybe the hands) ONLY?” I remember you also believing in a miracle as far as the Jospice matteress man’s image was concerned. This is not serious at all! Unfortunately, several of Mario’s major & minor assumptions are biased i.e. Non archaeological e.g. Model’s head tilted backward not forward, non curved back, no folding at buttock level, one single shroud when actually several shrouds were used etc). Mario himself recognized the TS image is a projection, ALMOST (upper cases mine) orthogonal (that is not totally orthogonal). Besides state of the art experimental archaeology has nothing to do with Mario’s reconstruction on which you almost blindingly rely: Mario totally keeps overlooking many a parameters: e.g. The collimation issue (and the role of “opaques” present in Jerusalem malky stone + judean desert storm dusts to account for the TS image fuzziness). Besides, he totally ignores the case of a shortened taharah in terms of wrapping in shrouds (more than two), purifying & drying (via alkaline solution and fumigation) to account for the lightly mordanted blood looking red in natural daylight as if it had been shed the day before. He also totally missed the long burial sheet could have been wet and first firmly drawn taut lengthwise over the head to the toes etc before being compressed widthwise. Methinks when Mario wrote his paper he was not familiar neither with Second Temple period funerary archaeology nor Judean burial core procedures or archaeological bloodstain patterns analysis. The latter is a must to reconstructing the TS man’s body wrapping in shrouds. On June 9, 2013 at 5:47 pm, I wrote: “(…) there are more than mere orthogonal properties involved in the TS image. There are also slight shifts and displacements recorded: – at face level (most likely due to the presence of an impromptu small ‘jawbox’ consisting in two wooden pieces placed underneath on each side of the head and a shorter one on top under the chin and used in conjunction with a small face cloth (now kept in Manppello) and a skull cap (now kept in Cahors) on top of the TS so as to tightly shut the long burial sheet at head level). Most likely the three wooden pieces were sawn off the titulus damnationis). Reminder: As early as the 4th centry, the TD is described as a relic divided into three pieces (one in Rome, one in Jerusalem and one in Constantinople) (…).” Most likely the two smaller shrouds (face cloth aka Veil of Manoppello + skull cap aka Headdress of Cahors) were (respectively) placed and fastened over the main burial sheet to shut it at head level and keep fastened the improvised head apparatus to keep the TS man’s mouth shut. This I deduced both from a close examination of the front and back head images, from the three shrouds and from my two attempts (!n 1994 and 1997 CE) at reconstructing the wrapping in shrouds of the TS man’s body.” “The TS man’s face does show many an image deficit implying air gaps and/or presence of screening objects. 3 D images can give you a fairly good idea of the way prominent crease marks at headtop and chin level did fit the TS man’s head and imply the latter was bound and compressed as the (then watery solution in soaked) shroud, literally do appear moulded around his head, front (and back). Partial/uneven extreme compression of the face could account for the very faint partial “second blood image of the head” found by Fanti at the back of the cloth.” “The blood marks seen on the hair of the frontal image of the Shroud of Turin were originally on his face (temples, cheeks and beard) not in his hair as they now appear to be in the image. Most likely in the process the long inner body shroud (aka the TS) got sort of taut again through shrinking, which account for some of the resulting blood marks (resulting from thorn punctures of the temple and forehead) seen on the face and hair to have been originally on the cheek (geometric distortion most likely due to shrinking up while getting sort of taut at one and the same time at face level). This tends to prove the blood decals came first, the body image second.” My two attempts (!n 1994 and 1997 CE) at reconstructing the wrapping in shrouds of the TS man’s body, I repeat, had me understand at least TWO (slightly) different configurations of the long burial cloth in close conjunction with the corpse (from beginning to end via cloth to body sticking gradually unsticking process) were a must, not just one, to account for the integrity of the blood clots. Because a loosely draped/bound burial cloth just means NO collimation, it JUST CANNOT WORK to conclusively account for the TS bloodied body HD image. Cloth to body no air gap or almost no air gap front and back for a while (first configuration) is also a must here that does seem to totally eludes Mario and you..","date":"2015-06-09","mins":"7:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"id":"comment-201406","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Actually, on September 19, 2012 at 7:16 pm, I wrote: “Father Dubarle wrote an article about the “Veil of Antinoë” (“a face veil excavated early in the 20th c.

However, as a pioneer, Father Filas did find sthg but most unfortunately was the victim of BOTH positive AND negative pareidoliae: he misread the truncated inscription that what was there, thought he saw a full lituus/augur wand that was not really there and totally missed at least three paleographic elements that were really there. Re YOUR “pro domo sua” statements: 1/ You NOW wrote: “Hachlili speaks about HUNDREDS (my upper cases) of tombs and one single evidence of a coin on the eyes” NOT “thousands” a you FIRST implied quoting Lombatti. Reminder for Lombatti and archsceptics: “Although during the past century HUNDREDS OF TOMBS DATING FROM THE SECOND TEMPLE DOWN TO THE LATE ROMAN PERIOD have been excavated or surveyed, coin are a rare occurrence.” (dixit Hachlili p. 437, ibidem). 2/ Now Rahmani and Hachlili’s INTERSUBJECTIVITY is quite obvious to the attentive reader of their articles on the coin on eye issue. Shall I repeat (till you can finally hear!) that “anatomothanathologically” speaking, small thin coins found in the mouths of some skulls, may very well have dropped through from the eye sockets as the soft tissues decay. The placing of coins over the eyes per se is consistent with the Halakha too (Judean/Jewish religious law). Besides the very presence of 46 Pilate coins found in STP tombs is also consistent with a sporadic funerary practice/sporadic funeray practices in which they were used; practices that have not yet been convincingly cleared up. To claim to the contrary is BAD archaeology. Hachlili also wrote: “This (referring to three instances of coins associated with skulls) MIGHT have been (MIND not “WAS”!) inspired by the pagan Greek custom (Charon’s)”. Actually she just cannot convincingly state whether the Greek custom was literally applied as such or totally revisited and in which way. Basic reminder one for you: re the sporadic custom of placing coins over a STP deceased’s eyes, lack of evidence is not absence of evidence The true fact is there is SOME anatomothanathological, Halakhic (closing/covering of the eye of the deceased) and archaeological EVIDENCE to the contrary… Basic reminder two: A custom that is sporadic is non widespread/not common (here among STP Judeans). Basic reminder three: “The placing of coins over the eyes is reported in only one case at ‘En Boqeq (furthermore, it is highly doubtful the interred at the site was a Jew)” (dixit Hachlili on p. 443). Two Hadrian silver coins (early Second c. CE) were found in the deceased’s orbits. Most likely (i.e. Anatomothanalogically speaking), the two coins were too thick to drop through the orbital fissures and fall into the brain pan as the body decayed. Basic reminder four: in Greek the word lepton means “thin”. Hachlili’ conclusion: “Jews quite rarely used items with pagan characters as grave goods: the example consist mainly of ring gems AND COINS” (see p. 445). In other words irrespective of Asmonian and Herodian coins, procurator/Pilate coins were used by Judeans in Second Temple period funerary practices.

Re the interpretation of the suspected areas, most of the archsceptics (whether authenticists or anti authenticists) either haven’t got the initiated eye for paleographic forms and the first clue about what good archaeology is all about or are speaking out of their field and wrong. Reminder: an American professional numismatist, two Israeli scholar numismatists and three ancient coin collectors and amateur numismatists (among whom a Pilate coin specialist) more ‘sensed’ than correctly identified the tiny markings left by a Pilate coin obverse (dilepton lituus type) on the right eye area.

I repeat: Boni ben Gwryon aka Naqdimon/Naqi/Nikodemos/Nicodemus is well known as an Hellenistic Judean (see Talmwd Babli). He was one of Yeshua’s buriers. Re Joseph Aramathea, Aramathea comes from Ha Ramathaym in Hebrew. Litterally it means “The Two Heights” and most likely this designation doesn’t so much refer to a city as to the known fact among Yeshua’s disciples, Yoseph Aramathea had a garden (with a cave tomb under a vine and a figtree) on Mount Golgotha and an olive field on Mount Olive i.e on two Jerusalem mounts or “two heights”. This is my own etymocryptology of Aramathea. Now its very transcription in Greek as Aramathia is a Hebrew Greek pun on the phrase, aristos mathetes, “best disciple”. Most likely alike Nikodemos/Naqdimon he was a Hellenistic Judean Besides most likely Joseph Aramathea and Joseph Barabas are one and the same man. Most likely aka Joseph of Aramathea) and was a rich man and a Levite from Cyprus (see my 2005 unpublished paper in French “Linceul de Turin : L’Eloge Funèbre du Christ Retrouvée ? ou Tentative de décrytptage d’un très singulier rebus monétaire”). Therefore BOTH Nicodemus and Joseph of Aramathea were Hellenistic Judean (most likely liberal Pharisees from Sadduceean background).

This is a myth. Besides the lituus and simpulum shapes can combine to evoke the two libation vessels used to mix wine and water in the Jerusalem Temple. They are ambivalent/neutral isolated simplified symbols to agree with both 1st c CE Judean and Roman sensibilities.

This is their main HEAVY DESEASE not mine! They just see the speck in their neighbor ‘s eye, but not the beam in theirs. Since most of the time I write from memory AND in haste (having breaks in snatches while working) Ch F, Ya C and Da M, allow me to do typos et don’t you make too much of them. Methinks because the three of you just cannot substantially refute facts, you make ad homs. Your lack of true research and studies on the coin and floral image issue does show. Reminder: Most NOT ALL the excavated skulls were found in a damaged condition. ONE coin of Agrippa I was found “in a woman’s skull” (dixit Hachlili) (NOT in a woman’s damaged skull”) in ossuary 8 from the CAIAPHAS TOMB, Jerusalem (p. 438). TWO coins were found in the Jericho D3 tomb. My typo is on the tomb reference (D/18 for D3) (just typing in haste from memory) NOT on the fact two coins were found stuck “in a skull” (dixit Hachlili)! ONE coin was found in Jericho D18 tomb “in a damaged skull” (dixit Hachlili) (p.439). Now can Ch F, Ya C and Da M tell me why on pages 438 and 439 of her book, Hachlili linguistically DISCRIMINATE between “coin found in damaged skull” (p 439) and “coin found in a skull” (p. 438) ? This is not clear. Had the skull found in Caiaphas tomb been damaged, why doesn’t Hachlili specify it on page 438? Methinks it was good forensic linguistics to infer in the woman’s skull case was either undamaged or slightly damaged that is intact or fairly intact as opposed to those found in Jericho. Besides, I shall repeat, the placing of Pilate coins over the TS man’s eyes on his burial correlates with: 1/ the Halakha (or Jewish/Judean religious law) re the closing/covering of the deceased’s eyes so they won’t be open because as long as they can see the present duration they cannot see the duration to come (see the Mishnah). 2/ archaeological finds of nearly four dozens of Pilate coins in Second Temple period tombs (see Rachel Hachlili’s book) implying they were used in a funerary practice or practices. 3/ Anatomothanathology since via a ‘piggy bank effect’, small thin coins such as Pilate coins can drop through the skull’s orbital fissures and fall in the oral cavity or brainpan of the deceased as the body decays (see American MD, Alan Whanger’s & ancient coin Italian collector, Mario Moroni’s experiments). 4/ the Gospels since Hellenistic Judeans (most likely Yeshua’s buriers were liberal Pharisees from Sadduceean background. They were NOT Galilean or conservative Pharisees buriers). 5/ the very fact that at least 3 4 ancient coin experts/specialists (one American professional numismatist, two Israeli scholar numismatists and three ancient coin collectors and amateur numismatists (among whom a Pilate coin specialist) independently did ‘sense’ (more than correctly identify) the presence of the Pilate coin on the right eye. “Put that in your pipe, (Charles Freeman, Yannick Clément, David Mo), and smoke it! If you still think the placing of coins over the TS man’s eyes is unlikely and ‘the sensing’ Pilate coin very partial impressions by 3 4 ancient coin experts/specialists just ‘crazy stuff’, just ask yourself if YOU really have got an eye for paleographic forms and really can discriminate between misreading, negative and positive pareidoliae. Just ask yourself what is really GOOD archaeology all about. Methinks Charles Freeman, Yannick Clément and David Mo should ask themselves those three very simple questions and try to honestly answer them for a change. David Mo you wrote: “Max: Your arguments are based again and again on unwarranted suppositions.” Oh really? What about yours? Shall I repeat my stand (typos corrected): In the context of a Judean burial of the Second Temple period, the Charon’s obol theory is a most unconvincing explanation as it creates more questions than answers and has a potential to mislead. For instance, in the Jericho D3 tomb case, WHY EXACTLY a Judean burier or mourner would have felt the need to place two coins instead of only one in the deceased’s mouth as Charon’s obol? Would the two coins have been intended for a return trip? In the Caiaphas’ tomb (intact?) skull case, WHY EXACTLY would a high priest family of Jerusalem have felt the need to recur to this very rare heretical practice to bury one of its deceased members since Sadducees did not even believe in resurrection or afterlife!) ? Methinks it verges on sheer anachronism. Therefore, it would be good archaeology to integrate the forensic datum to reassess past findings and keep an open mind for the coin on eye issue in connection with the Turin Shroud?” Could Ch F, Ya C and Da M answer those questions and spell them, please? On October 7, 2014 at 11:20 am I added: “re what Hachlili (following Rahmani) thinks result from the placing of a coin in the mouth of STP deceased as payments to Charon (Charon’s obol), she wrote: “As Jews were often influenced by the surrounding Hellenistic culture, ON OCCASION they ADOPTED (my upper cases) Hellenistic practices and customs WITHOUT ACCEPTING necessarily their pagan significance.” (ibidem p. 441). Methinks this is not only a bit too short but also quite convoluted. Ch F, Ya C and Da M can buy into that, I as a professional cryptoanalyst methinks that recurring to an alleged ‘Charon’s obol’ to account for the coins found in STP Judean skulls just doesn’t fit somewhere along the line. The question of very partial impressions of coins on eye areas remains a viable hypothesis whether Ch F, Ya C and Da M ’emotionally’ or ‘viscerally’ don’t like it. Besides IMHO, as a professional cryptologist, methinks I have reached the Holy Grail of evidence that leads to conclusively demonstrate (from authentic TS face photographs by Enrie, Miller and Durante) the presence of partial markings (most likely tiny blood plasma and bloodstain patterns) left by two Pilate coin obverses (dilepton lituus and lepton simpulum types). However to complete my research paper and convincingly prove beyond the shadow of a rational doubt partial Pilate coin impressions are really on the TS face, I do need to double and triple and even quadruple check my findings from HD authentic/first generation slides and/or digital copies of the Sindon face photographs, the 2008 HAL9000 TS eye areas photographs included. This would be GOOD archaeology. Shall I remind them AGAIN AND AGAIN of Hachlili’ conclusion: “Jews quite rarely used items with pagan characters as grave goods: the example consist mainly of ring gems AND COINS” (see p. 445). In other words irrespective of Hasmonean and Herodian coins, procurator/Pilate coins were used by Judeans in a Second Temple period funerary practice or practices and the latter have still to be convincingly cleared up. To claim the opposite is BAD archaeology, which is exactly what Ch F, Ya C and Da M are advocating (this no surprise as they haven’t the first clue what discriminating between misreading, negative and positive pareidoliae is all about). To evoke an allegedly ‘very rare heretical practice’ associated with Charon’s obol to account for the presence of coins in Second temple period damaged and/or undamaged skulls is NOT the final word/absolute truth but in Ch F, Ya C and Da M’s dreams. The true fact is THERE IS A SERIES OF anatomothanathological (the piggy bank effect’ with small thin coins placed over the deceased’s eyes), Halakhic (closing/covering of the eye of the deceased, see Mishnah, tract. Shabbat) and archaeological (STP tombs yielded 124 coins in trems of Hasmonean, Herodian and Roman coins , mainly Pilate coins), Literary and Numismatic EVIDENCE OF PLACING COINS OVER THE DECEASED’S EYES CAN HAVE BEEN A SPORADIC SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD CUSTOM/PRACTICE… whether Ch F, Ya C and Da M just don’t like the very idea.

Now most curiously, if you apply what I call the lezeker bezeker cryptographic system (or Hakhamic/rabbinic hermeneutic/cryptographic system) to a Pilate coin obverse bearing a lituus or augur wand for instance, you can decode by means of an association of ideas and ‘imageplay’, the very name Yeshua’ as the bronze central device (seen in conjunction with the final C letter in the KAICAPOC inscription and through rabbinic/hakhamic eyes) can visually conjure up a “brass snake” like shaped form (nâHâsh or ne Hushstân ne Hoshet in Hebrew).

Reminder two: in Aramaic NâZRâTh or NâTs RâTh (“Nazareth”) means a grotto region nestled/hidden (“hidden”, in Ancient Heb. Nun, notsry) in a valley surrounded/crowned by mountains. In the Second Temple period the very words NâZRâTh or NâTs RâTh also referred to “a centre of resistance” NOT to a city. Nazareth as a city was built in the 5th 6th c. CE. Reminder three: Visually speaking, a romanized literate liberal Hellenistic judean (from Sadduceean background?) burier could have noticed that: 1/ the simpulum image on the Pilate coin obverse could be subdivided into two other images e.g. A ritualistic bowl topped by a 1st c. CE square Hebrew monogram reading like a double Nun letter or a Bet letter combined with a final Nun letter that is reading either Ben Nun (“Son of Perpetuation”) or Be Nun (“In Perpetuation” = “In Memory”). 2/ the lituus image,,once almost upside down, could be connected to the final luna sigma (C) of the inscription KAICAPOC to form e.g. A bronze snake and a capital I in Roman cursive. Thus through one f the buriers’ CREATIVE VISION, ID information of the crucifixion victim could have been hidden here by means of a series of “imageplays” to be read from right to left and top to bottom: First reading: – a square monogram polyvalent for Be Nun,”In Perpetuation”, “In Memory”; “ben, “son”, nun “50/fivety” > Ben Nun, “son of the 50/fivety (gates of understanding/holiness) = a Hakham, “a wise/skillful man”, “a master of wisdom” > IN PERPETUATION HAKHAM – a brass snake, symbol of both “Victory (over death/illness/the enemy)” and “Salvation”, “Yeshua’ in Hebrew, which is also the very Hebrew surname of “Jesus (of Nazareth)” > YESHUA” Second reading: – a square Hebrew monogram reading Nun Ben with Nun meaning “Hidden” and synonymous of Nostry, short for Notsraty referring to “(someone) of the (rocky mountain) grotto region (of Galilee) > NOTSRY BEN – the capital I in Roman cursive + saph, “a bowl” = Y saph > YSSAPH or YOSSEPH, “Joseph” Now (irrespective of the coin legends), one can clearly read (short eulogy version): IN PERPETUATION (FOR EVER AND EVER) OF HAKHAM YESHUA’ HA NOTSRY BEN YOSSEF/JESUS DE NAZARETH FILS DE JOSEPH. Re the two Pilate coin reverse types namely a laurea or “crown of laurel” with berries and its X shaped like attachment and a fascis or a “bunch”of three whole sheaves of barley in a tripod, the outer two sheaves drooping. Within the context of a numismatic silent eulogy: – the crown, as a Judean funerary symbol, can refer to “a crown of Thorah” (with X for the Hebrew ancient letter Tav as initial of the word Torah) meaning “a great Torah scholar”. – the bunch of three whole sheaves of barley can evoke the Hebrew omer s’orah, “barley sheaves (tied) in a bunch”, symbol of Redemption. This symbol could trigger off the final fragment of a funerary votive formula in Hebrew: tehieh naphsho be tsror ha Hayim lereshit degan haggan eden (short acronym תנצב״ה), “May his soul be bound up in the bundle of the living as first fruit at harvest time in the garden of Eden.

NUN Interestingly, the numerical value of dag gadol — the Hebrew phrase in Jonah for “great fish” — is 50, which is also the numerical value of the letter nun. In Psalm 72, a psalm dedicated to David’s heir who is, in reality, Mashiach ben David of whom it is said: “His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.” (Ps. 72:17) “The phrase “his name shall be continued” is written in Hebrew as sh’mo (“his name”) yinon (“shall be continued). This particular verse has led some rabbinic sources to conclude that a cryptic name for the Messiah is Yinon – (“his name” is yinon). In fact, according to the Talmud, the Messiah (Heb. Mashiach) has four such names: Menachem “comforter,” Shiloh “peace,” Yinon and Chaninah “graceful.” Please notice that the first letters of each of these Hebrew names form an acronym for Mashiach. More importantly, notice that the name Yinon is actually the word nun preceded by the letter yud. In other words, a prominent name for the Messiah is tied to nun and all the concepts that the letter alludes to. According to the rabbinic work Pirkei de R’ Eliezer, Yinon most specifically alludes to rejuvenation (remember the fish).

(see e.g. British Society for the Turin Shroud – Issue #46). It is not said whether the skull was damaged or undamaged (secondary burial). A coin of John Hyrcan II was found inside a fractured skull in Jericho D/18 tomb (primary burial) and another nearby in the coffin. Two coins were found in an ossuary stuck in a skull in Jericho D/3 tomb (secondary burial). It is not said whether or not the skull was damaged or undamaged. BTW Even in the Charon’s obol case, coins could be placed on the eyes of the defunct not necessarily/automatically in the mouth or clenched between the teeth… In a research paper, THE COINS FROM EL KABRI, (‘Atiqot 51, 2006), Danny SYON wrote: “Charon’s obol, originally a classical Greek mythological theme, is referred to in ancient Greek and Latin literature as the payment required by the ferryman Charon to reach the mythological underworld. The latest mention of the custom is by the second century CE Latin author Apuleius (Metamorphoses VI:18). In the classical theme, the obol, or a low value copper coin in general, should be placed in the mouth of the deceased immediately after death.The archaeological record provides us with a wealth of coins found in tombs but it would be incorrect to associate all of them with this custom. Indeed, at least in Greece, the custom of providing the dead with coins is older than the mythological tradition of Charon (Stevens 1991:227). It seems that the custom underwent considerable changes in the Roman and Byzantine periods.

The true fact is placing coins over the deceased’s eyes as a Second Temple period/1st century CE CURRENT/DAILY PRACTICE is myth. However, the numismatic archaeological finds in Second Temple tombs just cannot TOTALLY RULED OUT a MOST SPORADIC PRACTICE of placing either a coin between the teeth/on the tongue OR over each eyes. 1/Is it “impossible” for coins to fall down into the mouth of an undamaged skull? So far as the archaeological record is concerned, only four small bronze coins (or prutot in Hebrew, dilepta in Greek) were retrieved inside three different skulls (one damaged, two undamaged) excavated from Judean tombs of the Second Temple period. Because all the coins were found in the oral cavity, those inside the two intact skulls were explained as coins “unequivocally” placed in the mouth and very rare manifestations of a pagan influence on Judean burial customs associated with Charon’s obol (or payment required by the ferryman Charon to reach the mythical underworld). Now it has been demonstrated experimentally a prutah or dilepton type coin (i.e. A thin small coin), placed over the eye of a deceased lying in a supine position with his head held upright (as if on a headstone or head rest) or tilted forward (as if on a pillow), by a “piggybank effect” may drop through the lower fissure in the back of the eye socket and fall into the mouth, as the body decays. It may also happen with a coin placed over both eyes. Although arch sceptics dismiss the coin on eye theory in connection with these finds, at close examination, in the context of a Judean burial of the Second Temple period, the Charon’s obol theory is a most unconvincing explanation as it creates more questions than answers and has a potential to mislead. For instance, in the Jericho D/18 tomb case, why exactly a Judean burier or mourner would have felt the need to place two coins instead of only one in the deceased’s mouth as Charon’s obol? Would the two coins have been intended for a return trip? In the Caiaphas’ daughter’s intact skull case, why exactly would a high priest family of Jerusalem have felt the need to recur to the pagan custom to bury one of its deceased members? It actually verges on sheer anachronism. Therefore, it would be good archaeology to integrate the forensic datum to reassess past findings and keep an open mind for the coin on eye issue in connection with the Turin Shroud. Reminder 1: Several 1st c. CE tombs (4 9) yielded more than 30 (30 40) Pilate coins throughout the Land of Israel. Reminder 2: An erroneous numismatic theory crept into Shroud literature. According to the Italian coin collector, Mario Moroni following Hendin, the Judeans considered it offensive to their religion to be forced to use coins depicting pagan symbols such as a simpulum and a lituus. This is far from a proven theory though currently accepted as such. Sporadic placings of a small coin over each eye to be found in the deceased’s mouth as the body decays is NOT inconsistent AT ALL with anatomothanathology, halakha (religious Judean/Jewish law) and Second Temple period archaeological finds. To claim to the contrary is BAD archaeology.

CE? In 2005, I discovered (it is a long story), Joseph of Aramathea/Yossef Ha Ramathaim and Joseph Barnabas/Yossef Bar Naba are one and the same man. The latter like John Mark/Yo Hanan Maqqaba/Lazarus/El’eazar was from Cryptos Island (= Cyprus).Nicodemus/Beni Naqdimon/Naqi ben Gwryon most likely was from Cyprus too. Whatever the case, he was a Hellenistic Judean (see The Talmwd Babli). Most likely, at least two of them were liberal Pharisees (from Sadducean background?)I also attempted to identify Yeshua’s 3 4 other buriers. In conjunction with Nicodemus/Naqdimon/Naqi I did find 3 4 other names among which that of Matthias/Mattayah, the substitute for Judas Iscarioth/Yehwdah Ish Karioth. They were Yeshua’s Hellenistic Judean secret disciples who buried him not his Galilean diciples. In 2005 I also found John Mark was High Priest Hanan’s assitant scribe and son, hence a Hellenistic Judean too (from Cyprus too?). Reminder 1 for Yannick: “What is most extraordinary in the Jewish burial customs of the Second Temple period is the astonishing fact that within a comparatively short span of time burial practices, which are typically among the most conservative customs in a society, underwent rapid changes.” Reminder 2: On March 6, 2014 at 6:23 I wrote: “As early as 1994, I myself thought there was a cloth laid on top of head too. Now the very presence of markings left by flower heads (and other plants?) on top of the head and around, did convince me flower heads did act as a screen along with air gaps. This is genuine Occam’s razor since to the initiated eye (Botanist’s and Archaeocryptologist’s), there really are markings left by flowers on top and around the TS head. Reminder: I did detect and identify four floral images (of compressed fresh flower heads)on the HD TS face close up 3 D reconstruction by Tamburelli. Then I submitted my findings to Avinoam (who has got the eye for floral forms). He agreed for at least 2 crown daisies inflorescences I found in Tamburelli’s 3 D close up.” and “Most likely there was neither “penetration” nor any “thick” layer of flowers on the top of the head, just a few compressed flower heads (probably mixed with fresh plants) implying air gaps in between hence a very faint and incomplete recording while the face ‘hills’ and ‘valleys’ were manually moulded with no air gap.” Reminder 3: Yeshua was buried in a GARDEN cave tomb. Reminder 4: The koine Greek word aromaton, ‘spices” used in John’s Gospel can refer to medical fresh plants and flower heads (used as insect repellent)not only to myrrh resin and aloe wood. Now fresh coronation daisy heads could have been be used as an insect repellent on Yeshua’s burial.John 19:40 can read: “So they took the body of Yeshua and fastened/bound it in shrouds along with the spices (= granulized myrrh, aloe wood AND/OR fresh plants and flowers), as is the burial custom of the Judeans.” Most likely myrrh resin mixed with aloe wood formed in solid blocks or lump shape or granulized myrrh mixed with aloe wood in small bags were packed alongside the corpse and fastened in shrouds while granulized myrrh resin was spread on the burial bench (to absorb body fluids and prevent bad smells). Most likely aloe wood (and granulized myrrh resin?) were (also) used to make a fumigation for tahara. Question 1: Could Joe Zias account for the fairly current presence on Second Temple period ossuaries, sarcophagi and memorial tomb facades of many flower head decorations more or less stylized(as “rosettes”) or in fine detail, among which coronation daisy and rock rose heads (the very same head flower types of which floral images were found on the TS and confirmed by Israeli botanist Avinoam Danin)? (See e.g. Hachlili’s Jewish Funerary Customas, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period, BRILL ed., 2005.) Question 2: Were remnants of decayed roots from plants/trees ‘probably'(sic) mistaken too for the bouquet of withered flowers found in the Giv’at ha Mivtar ossuary that held the bones of the sole Second Temple period crucifixion victim ever found in the Land of Israel? Reminder 3: Most likely he use of an alkaline solution to soak in the inner large burial wrapping aka TS working in conjunction with an external source of heat (fumigation as purification/cleansing ritual) could account for the recording of images of compressed fresh flower heads and small copper/brass coins very partially smeared with blood on the stretched and then slightly unstretched 3/1 twill fabric. Reminder 4: Most likely too Pilate coins were used in Second Temple period funerary practices. All the more so as, symbolically speaking, Pilate coin central devices were specifically designed (or ambivalent enough as ‘aniconic designs’) to agree with both 1st c CE Judean and Roman sensibilities and be used by Judeans on an everyday basis. The fact is aniconic lepta and dilepta were allowed in the Jerusalem Temple treasure chamber (re read Mark and the ‘widow’s mite/Pilate coin episode’). Had Pilate coins feature really offensive central devices, they just could not have been used by Judeans, which is not the case. Archaeologically speaking, Pilate coins were used in Second Temple period/1st c. CE funerary practices too (nearly a dozen of Jewish tombs yielded 46 Pilate coins both dilepta (lituus type) and lepta (simpulum type). That’s a fact unless like Zias you think all the Pilate coins found in STP tombs ‘simply fell out of the pockets (sic!)of those visiting or preparing the tomb'(dixit). If so in the Jason’s Tomb for instance (Greenhut’s reference), they were many to have a hole in ‘their pockets’ and to lose Pilate coins since, in 1956, it yieded more than 55 coins among which no less than 28 Pilate coins (at the feet and nearby the body remains). Sporadic Second Temple funerary practices have not been convincingly cleared up yet (see Greenhut). Placement of Roman aniconic coins over the deceased’s eyes (no matter how sporadic) just cannot thus be totally excluded in the state of our knowledge of 1st c. CE Jewish burials. The fact remains 59 coins of “Roman procurators” + 12 “Roman” coins were found inside a dozen of Second Temple period tombs. More than half of them are Pilate coins (augur wand and pail types). This speaks volumes re the use of Roman coins in Second Temple period funerary pratices. It was a Second Temple period sporadic funerary pratice at worse, yet a funerary practice all the same.Besides Roman coins, Herodian coins too shall be taken into account, which involved 27 Second Temple period tombs (hence more than two dozens) and 124 coins in all (in 2005) thus more than 10 dozens of coins. Methinks they might well be only the tip of the Second Temple period funerary monetary iceberg respective of the percentage of coins inside tombs that were undiscovered, or else disappeared with time and given the fact only 8 9 hundreds of Second Temple period TOMBS were excavated so far. Reminder 5: The body image resolution is 0.5cm while the blood image (and thus any blood smeared object images) resolution is 0.4 0.5mm. Experimentally, Moroni, Rodante and myself could record Pilate coin or one Euro cent coin tiny characters on a 3/1 twill fabric providing the coin is partially smearded with blood. This is an experimental fact. Reminder 6: Yosseph Ha Ramathaym/Yossef Bar Naba could gave placed himself the coins over Yeshua’s eyes on burial as the very name Yossef was given to the eldest son/disciple (Ben = Tamid = Disciple in Hebrew)for him to close not only his father’s eyes but also his master’s (aka Yeshua Ha Nostry’s/Jesus of Nazareth’s). The placing of coins over Yeshua’s eyes had nothing to do with the Charon’s obol. Most likely it was both to keep his eyelids closed or to cover his still open/half open eyes AND to read as a silent/coin rebus like/coin puzzle like eulogy as eulogy was not allowed to be pronounced in the month of Nissan, the month in which Yeshua was put to death. According to Jewish traditional custom, the eulogy should not be PRONOUNCED to honour the departed during the entire month of Nisan. Hence recurring to a monetary rebus to silently honour the departed Rabbi is therefore a real possibility to finally account for the placement of coins over eyes in the Second Temple period. Most likely, the placement of coins over Yeshua as great Torah Scholar’s eyes was done with this kavannah, i.e. In this specific design. The word kavvanah (literally “direction”)refers to one ‘s state of mind/intention i.e. Concentration on the meaning of the words recited, the act performed (here silent eulogy), or the theological goal (such as the acceptance of the sovereignty of God). Therefore it would be good archaeology not to too rapidly rule out the real possibility for such small thin bronze coins to have been originally placed over the eyes in order both to keep the deceased’s eyelids closed (or cover his eyes) and pay a last tribute to the deceased’s memory in the manner of a rebus like silent eulogy (see my 2005 unpublished paper “Linceul de Turin : L’Eloge Funèbre du Christ Retrouvée ? ou Tentative de décrytptage d’un très singulier rebus monétaire”. Besides Moroni in the late 1980s, in the 1990s, American MD, Alan WHANGER experimentally demonstrated too that, by a ‘piggybank effect’, a bronze dilepton (augur wand/lituus type), once placed on each eye of a deceased lying in a supine position, can drop through each superior orbital fissure and fall into the brain pan as the body decays.

That’s called a double standard and such a standard indicates a flawed argument. 2/ How can one follow Israeli anthropologist, Joe Zias, when he thinks ALL the coins (and Pilate coins) found in Second Temple Period tombs ‘simply fell out of the pockets (sic!) of those visiting or preparing the tomb’? If so in the Jason’s Tomb for instance, they were many to have a hole in ‘their pockets’ and to lose Pilate coins since, in 1956, it yielded more than 55 coins among which no less than 28 Pilate coins (at the feet and nearby the body remains).

It shall not be mistaken with careful physical cleansing Jewish/Judean ritual of a NON bloody body. The true archaeological fact is there is more than one way by which blood could have become depleted of key ingredients if one considers the bloody body purifying & drying ritual scenario, which Adler clearly did not (crucifixion being an implicit assumption in all his discussion at the expense of specific burial practices, rites and customs).

Most likely, there were specific circumstances in which (rich?) Judean buriers or mourners recurred to placing coins over eyes not only to prevent the deceased’s eyelids to lift up or to hide his/her open/half open eyes but also to honour the deceased’s memory and abide by the Halakha(Judean religious law)when the eulogy was not allowed to be pronounced. In the years 2003 2004, my personal investigation of the issue led me to seriously consider the possibility of coins central devices and/or legend to be used (within Second Temple period Judean context) in a manner of puzzle or rebus (i.e. Via image and word plays in Hebrew, Aramaic and even Greek) to have silent eulogy. Reminder: no eulogy for instance should be pronounced during burials occuring in the month of Nissan. Now in the hypothesis the TS man is Yeshua, he was put to death in the very month of Nissan at a time when most definitely a eulogy just could not be pronounced over his body (today it is allowed/tolerated to pronounce a eulogy only over great Torah Teachers’ bodies though). I even went as far as reconstructing both a short and long version of the TS man’s silent eulogy by means of Pilate coins symbols and legends (see my 2005 unpublished paper “Linceul de Turin : L’Eloge Funèbre du Christ Retrouvée ? ou Tentative de décrytptage d’un très singulier rebus monétaire”).” On March 22, 2014 at 4:00 pm, I also wrote: ” Sceptics have argued that the flower images are too faint for Danin’s determination to be definite.
