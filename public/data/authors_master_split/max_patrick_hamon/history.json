Although very interesting, Vignon’s vaporography theory, Rogers’ Maillard reaction hypothesis or Volckringer’s Herbal theory have their own shortcomings too. Curiously enough the “miraculists”, the “fraudulists” and the “naturalists” have the following bias in common: none of them ever thought the Turin man’s corpse might well have been subjected to a purifying & drying up Judean ritual! The fact is “non completed burial rite” & “loosely/naturally draped shroud” received ideas die hard. Cannot possibly any of the “miraculists” or “naturalists” AT LEAST read the Gospels in the light of the Greek philology, a possible Aramaic/Hebrew substratum, the History, Archaeology and halakha (Judean religious law) of the Second Temple period? How can at one and the same time such Shroud researchers (or old students) tell the Shroud image almost literally mirrors Yeshua’s Passion as it is related in the Gospels while only very remotely minding the accurate meaning of the Greek verbs used by the Evangelists to describe Yeshua’s burial?

Relying on the Gospels in the light of the Turin Shroud, the halakha (the Judean religious law) and the Judean burial practice and custom of the Second Temple period, my contention is Yeshua’s stiff rigid body was tightly wrapped up to counteract the effect of rigor mortis and his shed innocent blood to be purified and kept with the body. Hence the most likely reconstruction from the 4 evangelists could imply the long interior shroud (Gr. Sindôn, soaked with a watery solution?) to be first tautly wrapped (Gr. Enetulixen, Matthew 27, 59; Luke 23, 53) lengthwise around the stiff rigid bloody body and the latter thus wrapped to be then compressed (Gr. Eneilesen, Mark 15,46) and fastened (Gr. Edesan, John 19,40) width wise, with spices (Gr. Aromaton, i.e. Here fresh medical plants and flowers used as insect repellents), (in a veil, a prayer shawl used as a shorter shroud?) and two additional long linen strips (cut off from the lengthy original burial sheet, Heb. Sovev). Shall we prefer your exegetical absolute miraculistic “ready to think” and infer from the same 3 Greek verbs (entulisso, “wrapped, encircle”; eneileo, “compress, tightly wrap up” and deo, “fasten, bind) Yeshua’s body was LOOSELY wrapped on his entombment as you infer? I shall let the readers of this blog judge for themselves whether Yeshua’s body was loosely or tightly wrapped up on his entombment. And so on with die hard received ideas about Rabbi Yeshua’s burial. BTW, if you are so damn sure Yeshua’s body was LOOSELY wrapped, how then can you add: “the evangelists were much too vague to come to any solid conclusions on the matter”? In terms of exegesis, I shall let the readers of this blog judge for themselves again whether or not you are serious and “full of substance”. Sadly; the more I read some Christian “arch miraculists’ comments on my posts”, the more I cannot help thinking their Christian faith in Yeshua’s Resurrection is perverted by an idolizing faith in the supernatural of the Shroud image at the very expense of their Christian virtues and their insights into the relevant passages of the Gospels. “Examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good”..","date":"2012-03-05","mins":"10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/26/a-rather-silly-blog-with-a-not-sol-silly-shroud-of-turin-lecture/","cat":"history","title":"A Rather Silly Blog with a not so silly Shroud of Turin Lecture"},{"id":"comment-8890","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Many a half truth, biased/non confirmed observation, pseudo fact and received idea actually litter most of Shroud literature and set both Shroud science and archaeology back.

Adler NEVER SAID this indicated beyond the shadow of a doubt the TSM’s body had not been washed one way or another. THIS IS JUST YOUR “YOUR OWN LITTLE INTERPRETATION” of Adler’s observation and of the way you think or imagine a corpse is supposed to be washed under normal circumstances (i.e. Mainly through wiping). The fact is YOU ARE FALSIFYING BOTH BUCKLING AND ADLER’S CONCLUSIONS and totally ignoring/misunderstanding what my indirect washing theory REALLY is all about (i.e. Relatively exceptional circumstances). My theory excludes any form of wiping: it implies just body cloth compression and gradual pressure release as the inner cloth got taut again trough drying up. This is totally consistent for exudates of clots being humid enough to leave their neat decals on the inside of the burial inner cloth. Quoting Rogers you wrote: “No fibers in a pure image area were cemented together by any foreign material, and there were no liquid meniscus marks. The material that resembled blood stains was quite different. These facts seemed to eliminate any image formation hypothesis that was based solely on the flow of a liquid into the cloth.” It does seem you CANNOT READ Rogers when he wrote: “No fibers in a pure [BODY] image area were cemented together by any foreign material, and there were no liquid meniscus marks. THE MATERIAL THAT RESEMBLED BLOD STAINS WAS QUITE DIFFERENT. “This is totally consistent with my Sindon Image formation process theory! My theory is definitely NOT “based SOLELY on the flow of a liquid into the cloth” but ALSO on an external heating source and collimated mordanting. CANNOT YOU READ MY ENGLISH either? Still quoting Rogers, you wrote : “if a body was involved in image formation, it was dry at the time the color formed.” According to my theory the corpse was SUBECTED TO A DRING UP RITUAL. My theory is again totally consitent with Rogers’ opinion. You go even as far as contradicting yourself in two successive posts: You first wrote: “exudates of blood clots that were HUMID ENOUGH to leave a mirror imprint on the cloth” and then: “The conclusion that the body was MOST PROBALY DRY at the time it was put inside the Shroud.” And then to resolve the WET & DRY contradiction you called Barbet in: “[because] a fresh corpse can emit water vapors (and possibly some ammoniac too), once the corpse was put in the Shroud, these vapors were probably able to humidify again the surface of the blood clots on the skin. ” Does the use of the word “PROBABLY” by Barbet (a surgeon not a true medical examiner) mean his “surgeon’s opinion is a PROVEN/COMPELLING FACT there was no (indirect) washing at all of the body?

(I went thru all this months ago with him but it does seem I shall repeat it once more here till he really understands). Such a view (or should I better say “preaching”) of his presupposes: 1/Yossef Ha Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), waited until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him. Are you serious? Do you really think Yossef Ha Ramatayim would have also run the risk not to abide by Deuteronomy 21: 22 23 and wait to the very last minute for taking down himself or having Rabbi Yeshua’s body be taken down from the cross and buried? It does seem YC totally overlook “one little circumstantial fact”: in the Second Temple period, any working activity was to stop at midday “on preparation day” that is on the very eve of the great Shabbat of Pessa H/Passover (Pessa H 4, V). How then could possibly Joseph of Aramathia have bought a shroud after sunset and before dusk on that specific day when Jerusalem weavers’ workshops, stores and shops had all been closed for more than 6 6½ hours? This is a total exegetical non sense. Unless one is ignorant of the ethnic milieu and thinks a Judean of the Second Temple period would have waited until sunset on “preparation day” and go and buy a shroud long after all the weaver’s workshops and linen shops had closed, this reconstruction of the event chronology is most unlikely. In all likelihood, Yossef Ha Ramathaym had already bought a fine linen shroud for himself in anticipation of his own death and used it to wrap Yeshua’s body “with his shed innocent blood”. As a disciple of Yeshua, didn’t Yossef go as far as using his own recently hewn garden tomb near by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus to both abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to his burial? [Precision: the women bought the spices not just BEFORE but just AFTER the sabbatical rest. Mark (16: 1) raises the ambiguity which could result from the chronologically biased relation/presentation of the same fact in Luke (23: 56).] 2/ Modern time markers such as ‘evening’, ‘sunset’, ‘twilight dusk’ philologically cover the same realities for a Judean of the Second Temple period. Far from it! With respect to the time frame for Yeshua’s burial, here are the ancient biblical Hebrew words & expressions for the time markers from noon to night used in the Second Temple period yet currently overlooked by Shroud researchers/old students and exegetes: a/Tsot ha yom (or “midday”) refers to that time of the day at equal distance between sunset and sunrise. B/Tsohorayim (dual form of Tsohar, “dazzling light” or “zenith”) literally means “two dazzling lights” or “two zeniths” and refers to ‘both morning and evening lights’ merging into ‘noon’. C/Erev (“evening”) may indifferently refer to the 1st or the 2nd evening. Rabbi Yeshua died exactly between the first and the second evening (at the 9th hour). D/Beyn ha arbayim literally means “between the two evenings,” — arbayim being the dual form of erev, “evening.” The afternoon was divided into two halves: from noon to mid afternoon and from mid afternoon to sunset or put in other words from early to late evening (See Exodus 29:38 41, “They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha arbayim”). For the covenant people, the entire day revolved around the offering of the two Tamid lambs: that of the morning and that of the evening. “In a paper entitled « En Vue de la Solution Archéologique de l’Énigme » I presented in Turin in 1998, I wrote: « Le deuxième sacrifice quotidien du Temple (Numbers 28: 4 8) dit sacrifice du “soir” (evening sacrifice) se déroulait vers le milieu de l’après midi (mid afternoon) et pouvait être avancé d’une heure (une veille de Pâque) voire même de deux heures (lorsque cette grande fête tombait un Shabbat) (Pessa H 5:1). Le premier sacrifice avait lieu le matin. Ainsi “le premier soir” allait il du milieu du jour (from midday) jusqu’à la deuxième immolation en milieu d’après midi (until mid afternoon) et, « le deuxième soir », de la deuxième immolation du milieu d’après midi (from mid afternoon) jusqu’au crépuscule du soir (until twilight/dusk)».” e/Shqiya, “sunset”; the sun set at 18:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and 18:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. F/Beyn ha shemashot which literally means “between the suns” is an expression for “dusk” or “twilight” between the setting sun and the rising moon (which reflects the light of the sun). G/Layla, “night”; typically layla is taken to be when you can see three stars in the sky in reference to tset ha kokhavim, the first “three stars coming out” to announce a new day (here the great Shabbat of Pessa H). The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and19:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. Owing to a lunar eclipse or the Ruah Qadīm, “east wind” (Khamsin/Sharav); a wind blowing from the desert of Judea, the whole city of Jerusalem was plunged into darkness from tsohorayim (“noon”) to beyn ha arbayim (“between the two evenings” that is the 9th hour of the day; 15.34 p.m. On April 7 30 CE/ 15.04 p.m. On April 3 33 CE). In other words, for 3h34/3h04, on the very day Rabbi Yeshua died on the cross, it was also night, “layla” on that very day in the eye of a Judean of the Second Temple period. Hence, the actual maximum time frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. Within a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s 4 5 buriers had enough time to pre wash his body (i.e. To re dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. Sindôn/Heb. Sadin) soaked with alkaline waters and tightly wrap it up, with resh aromatic, medical insect repellent plants and floral heads (Gr. Aromaton), in linen clothes and strips (most likely the fresh spices were laterally placed on the shroud and then compressed through wrapping against Rabbi Yeshua’s naked body.) In the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three (or even seven) days immediately following his burial. Anointment was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite as it allowed preventing stench on those subsequent visits. Because this part of the rite was not done, the women had to buy and prepare spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the third day. They definitely had not to wash the deceased’s naked body at all but just to anoint his tightly wrapped up. Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period might well have been duly completed within a minimum of a two hours and a half time frame..","date":"2012-08-19","mins":"12:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/answers-to-many-questions-about-the-fold-marks-on-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"Answers to Many Questions About the Fold Marks on the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-15239","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"YC wrote: “HOW IN THE WORLD LIQUID BLOOD OOZING OUT OF MANY INJURIES (LIKE THE SCOURGE INJURIES FOR EXAMPLE) WOULD NOT CAUSE BIG SMUDGES ON A LINEN CLOTH ???

Ever thought of that? Cannot you read /haven’t you read my previous posts about my reconstruction of the TSM’s burial? Secondly, remoistened blood via in soaked linen doesn’t mean liquid blood. Cannot you discriminate between remoistened freshly dried up wounds and liquid blood? Thirdly, I am still waiting for you to geometrically and gravitationally account for the shooting star like shaped blood rivulet being recorded off image on the Sindon (as if coming off from the left elbow). Fourthly, in all likelihood the tightly wrapped up body within its in soaked long inner burial cloth was not washed as a 20th 21st century CE Shroud student think it should have. According to my theory, it might well have been purified via fumigation; in conjunction with warm alkaline waters, the very starch and saponine contained in the ancient linen having acted like washing agents.

The American medical examiner from STURP, the late Buckling NEVER CLAIMED as a proven fact the Sindon body had not been washed at all while another medical examiner, Zubige DID CONCLUDE the body was washed (one way or another)! Have you ever compared the Oviedo Sudarium and Turin Sindon haematic cartography? The former is heavily stained with body fluids when the latter is not so much so. CAN YOU ACCOUNT for that state of things if the corpse what not one way or another washed? Are you aware that starch and soap (saponaria officinalis) (detected on the Sindon) once mixed with warm alkaline water (and the corpse being subjected to a heating source such as a fumigation) is a very simple and rapid way if not to “meticulously clean up” at least to purify shed innocent blood and body on a hasty burial? Have you ever noticed that most if not all the biblical scholars who have/had an interest in the Turin Sindon are miraculists or arch miraculists and currently strived their outmost to have the Gospel testimonies fit in with what THEY THINK OR IMAGINE Yeshua’s resurrection was? This is not good exegesis. I made an in depth study of the Gospel Greek terminology (that e.g. Of the burial and empty tomb scenes), Yeshua’s most likely burial time frame and Second Temple period Judean burial customs, pratices and rites. This leads me to conclude there was time enough for 4 5 buriers to perform a complete specific burial (burying of the shed innocent blood of a man unfairly sentenced to death by the Sanhedrin). Because the women were not allowed to ground spices on Sabbath, SOLE was delayed the anointment ritual of the body with perfumed oil that allowed preventing bad smells on the visits during the first three (or even seven) days that immediately followed the deceased’s death. To that sole exception, ALL the other rituals were performed on the very day of Yeshua’s death. This means the women were not to anoint his naked but his tightly wrapped up body. In the Gospels, the conjugated Greek verbs entulisso, “wrapped, encircle”; eneileo, “compress, tightly wrap up” and deo, “fasten, bind” are used to describe Yeshua’s burial. That’s a literary and philological FACT you just keep ignoring to falsify the event… Yannick that’s “funny how you seem to most dramatically and dishonestly neglect all these data AND SO MANY OTHERS (I hane not time to expose them all here) in order to just comfort your own little “theory”…”.

The two stone sculpted inscriptions on the pedestal read: 1600 CE (on the West face) and LANVOXO (1515 CE) the North face) NOT MCCCIV (1304 CE) as François Gazais most misleadingly claimed (misreading). Besides the Capital writing style of both inscriptions just cannot be early 1300 CE style. The same goes for the general aspect of the Christ face embossed in granite. However the latter’s most original/intriguing features (Christ head with no nimbus and epsilon letter like shape mark, right in centre of stone sculpted and landscape frame 2 X1) could indicate this is a stone copy of a much older stone template dating back to the Knights Templar.

Reminder once I wrote re “the Turin Shroud configuration one”: “Most likely, two canes were inserted widthwise through the double tubed S like shaped fold purposefully made midway in the part of the cloth held taut to account for the lack of image at buttock level (see Thierry Castex’s figure 4 – 3 D Dorsal View of the Front Side). The horizontal S fold was an ease fold to help correctly handle, wrap and bind the stiff rigid body placed in extra height to be subjected to a (myrrhic )aloetic fumigation thus creating sort of a tight protective seal (much akin to shrink wrap back and front) over the stiff rigid corpse tightly wrapped up in shroud S. Most likely, once the corpse was tightly wrapped up, the pair of canes tranversally inserted through the S fold at buttock level (in the bottom half of the long inner burial cloth) could also have helped carry the wrapped up body down to the tomb chamber and place it on the tomb bench on granulized myrrh and then the canes were removed.”.","date":"2014-02-10","mins":"6:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"id":"comment-78077","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Or to put it in other words/if you prefer they are “held down rivulets” via a circlet at the back of the head..","date":"2014-02-10","mins":"12:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"id":"comment-78120","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: “held on rivulets”.","date":"2014-02-10","mins":"4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"id":"comment-78152","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Louis you wrote: “That is the best explanation position we seem to have right now.” Only IF the burial cloth was just loosely draped/wrapped over the body, which is far from proven yet.

The doubt in regard to what is here really meant is as old as Chrysostom. The latter says, (Horn. X. On this epistle) “that the word (phailonen) denotes a garment (to himation = a very large rectangle of fabric that can be draped as a shawl, a cloak, or a head covering)”. The philological fact is the word can read as a reference to a very large wrap, wrapping fabric or wrapper. Now the Greek Word φαιλόνην (phailonen) is derived from the ancient Greek word phao, “to shine”, “give light” (e.g. A heavenly light such as surrounds angels when they appear on earth) or “make manifest”. Thus philologically speaking, the word phailonen most accurately denotes “a very large wrap that shines and/or makes manifest (through a porthole in the middle?)” and can refer to the TS shroud as a 4.44m long and 1.13m wide sindon/himation in which shines (in full daylight or natural transmitted light) the crucifixion victim’s bloody body (or just face?) image as visual epitome of the Gospels.

Phrynicus, a Greek sophist of the second half of the third century, defines it as `a receptacle for books, clothes, silver, or anything else.’ Phelonen was a wrapper of parchments, and was translated figuratively in Latin by toga or paenula `a cloak,’ sometimes of leather; also the wrapping which a shopkeeper put round fish or olives; also the parchment cover for papyrus rolls. Accordingly it is claimed that Timothy in 4:13 is bidden to bring, not a cloak, but a roll case. So the Syriac Version.” 1 This is ok BUT the last word doesn’t automatically rest on the Syriac Peshitta version. Besides in Horn. X. On this epistle, Chrysostome says, I repeat, “that the word (phailonen) denotes a garment (to himation = a very large rectangle of fabric that can be draped as a shawl, a cloak, or a head covering)”.

Most likely John the Presbyter (of whom Polycrates said he was ONCE a high priest as he wore the petalon) = John Mark (since the latter is the transcription of Yo Hanan/Yonathan Ha Maqqabah = John “the Hammer”/the Maccabee = belonging to the priestly Judean family. At the time of Yeshua’s Passion, Death and Resurrection, he was both the assistant secretary/assistant scribe (= a young man), Gr. Hemeneutes + Gr. Huperethen — applied to the same person namely John Mark — < Heb. Sophereth, see my own analysis) and son of High Priest Hanan. Besides the Gospel of the Hebrews can be dated just after the middle of the 1st c. CE. It is a Lost Gospel not an Apocryphon per se if we are to rely on Jerome who is our chief source of knowledge about this Gospel. According to the latter Yeshua's gave his shroud [sindon] to \"the servant/auxiliary of the priest\". Here the words servant/auxiliary can refer to John Mark/\"The Maccabee\" as High Priest Hanan's assistant scribe. Now it is well known 'the regalia of the high priest' were zealously guarded by the Maccabees… John Mark/John the Presbyter was also designated to be a high priest as early as 36 CE yet resigned on the same year (see Claude Tesmontant's \"Enquête sur l'Apocalypse\", p.221 295, ed.

Since I read your comments on this blog, you currently keep rehashing Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was made in haste after sunset (that is within about half an hour or so) and his shroud just draped about his body or loosely bound for the women to wash and anoint his body at the first morning hour of the first day of the Hebrew week, that is just after the Shabbat, on the third day of Yeshua’s death. Such a view (or should I better say “preaching”) presupposes: 1/Yossef Ha Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), waited until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him. Are you serious? Do you really think Yossef Ha Ramatayim would have also run the risk not to abide by Deuteronomy 21: 22 23 and wait to the very last minute for taking down himself or having Rabbi Yeshua’s body be taken down from the cross and buried? It does seem you totally overlook “one little circumstantial fact”: in the Second Temple period, any working activity was to stop at midday “on preparation day” that is on the very eve of the great Shabbat of Pessa H/Passover (Pessa H 4, V). How then could possibly Joseph of Aramathia have bought a shroud after sunset and before dusk on that specific day when Jerusalem weavers’ workshops, stores and shops had all been closed for more than 6 6½ hours? This is a total exegetical non sense. Unless one is ignorant of the ethnic milieu and thinks a Judean of the Second Temple period would have waited until sunset on “preparation day” and go and buy a shroud long after all the weaver’s workshops and linen shops had closed, this reconstruction of the event chronology is most unlikely. In all likelihood, Yossef Ha Ramathaym had already bought a fine linen shroud for himself in anticipation of his own death and used it to wrap Yeshua’s body “with his shed innocent blood”. As a disciple of Yeshua, didn’t Yossef go as far as using his own recently hewn garden tomb near by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus to both abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to his burial? [Precision: the women bought the spices not just BEFORE but just AFTER the sabbatical rest. Mark (16: 1) raises the ambiguity which could result from the chronologically biased relation/presentation of the same fact in Luke (23: 56).] 2/ Modern time markers such as ‘evening’, ‘sunset’, ‘twilight dusk’ philologically cover the same realities for a Judean of the Second Temple period. Far from it! With respect to the time frame for Yeshua’s burial, here are the ancient biblical Hebrew words & expressions for the time markers from noon to night used in the Second Temple period yet currently overlooked by Shroud researchers/old students and exegetes: 1/Tsot ha yom (or “midday”) refers to that time of the day at equal distance between sunset and sunrise. 2/Tsohorayim (dual form of Tsohar, “dazzling light” or “zenith”) literally means “two dazzling lights” or “two zeniths” and refers to ‘both morning and evening lights’ merging into ‘noon’. 3/Erev (“evening”) may indifferently refer to the 1st or the 2nd evening. Rabbi Yeshua died exactly between the first and the second evening (at the 9th hour). 4/Beyn ha arbayim literally means “between the two evenings,” — arbayim being the dual form of erev, “evening.” The afternoon was divided into two halves: from noon to mid afternoon and from mid afternoon to sunset or put in other words from early to late evening (See Exodus 29:38 41, “They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha arbayim”). For the covenant people, the entire day revolved around the offering of the two Tamid lambs: that of the morning and that of the evening. In a paper entitled « En Vue de la Solution Archéologique de l’Énigme » I presented in Turin in 1998, I wrote: « Le deuxième sacrifice quotidien du Temple (Numbers 28: 4 8) dit sacrifice du “soir” (evening sacrifice) se déroulait vers le milieu de l’après midi (mid afternoon) et pouvait être avancé d’une heure (une veille de Pâque) voire même de deux heures (lorsque cette grande fête « allait il du milieu du jour (from midday) jusqu’à la deuxième immolation en milieu d’après midi (until mid afternoon) et, « le deuxième soir », de la deuxième immolation du milieu d’après midi (from mid afternoon) jusqu’au crépuscule du soir (until twilight dusk)». 5/Shqiya, “sunset”; the sun set at 18:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and 18:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. 6/Beyn ha shemashot which literally means “between the suns” is an expression for “dusk” or “twilight” between the setting sun and the rising moon (which reflects the light of the sun). 7/Layla, “night”; typically layla is taken to be when you can see three stars in the sky in reference to tset ha kokhavim, the first “three stars coming out” to announce a new day (here the great Shabbat of Pessa H). The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and19:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. Owing to a lunar eclipse or the Ruah Qadīm, “east wind” (Khamsin/Sharav); a wind blowing from the desert of Judea, the whole city of Jerusalem was plunged into darkness from tsohorayim (“noon”) to beyn ha arbayim (“between the two evenings” that is the 9th hour of the day; 15.34 p.m. On April 7 30 CE/ 15.04 p.m. On April 3 33 CE). In other words, for 3h34/3h04, on the very day Rabbi Yeshua died on the cross, it was also night, “layla” on that very day in the eye of a Judean of the Second Temple period. Hence, the actual maximum time frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. Within a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s buriers had enough time to pre wash his body (i.e. To re dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. Sindôn/Heb. Sadin) soaked with a watery solution (ashes of the Red Heifer?) and tightly wrap it up, with fresh aromatic medical insect repellent plants, in linen clothes and strips. In the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three days immediately following his burial. Anointment was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite as it allowed preventing bad smells on those subsequent visits. Because this part of the rite was not done, the women had to buy and prepare spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the third day. They definitely had not to wash the deceased’s naked body at all but just to anoint his linen wrappings. Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period might well have been duly completed within a minimum of a two hours and a half time frame..","date":"2012-03-17","mins":"2:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"},{"id":"comment-9365","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Dan you wrote: “Barrie Schwortz did some of the earliest technical work to show one optical illusion effect of the banding.” Acually, the U shaped box interference on each side of the Shroud face image should not be too easily identified with mere optical illusion effect of two symetric vertical banding patterns framing up the face.

In his book The Image of Edessa, Mark Guscin (a linguist), while talking about the word found in the manuscript De Fide Orthodoxa mention that it normally mean “large outer cloak” !!! How in the world a “large outer cloak” can measure 4 meters long my friend ?” The TRUE FACTS are: The Greek word “himation” applied to the Edessa cloth CANNOT refer to a small face cloth at all BUT ONLY to a LONG RECTANGULAR PIECE OF CLOTH. In a preceding post, (July 2, 2012 at 9:55 am | #29), I wrote (cannot you read/haven’t you read me?) In 730 CE, in his Apologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Images, John of Damascus described the Image of Edessa as a himation. THIS IS A LITERARY FACT. A himation is an ankle length cloak/garment. It can be made of wool or heavier drape (winter/autumn wear), linen and cotton or lighter drape worn next to the skin as achiton/sindon (workwear, summer/spring wear and night/evening wear see e.g. The young man running away naked scene in the Gospel of Mark). See Greek clothing: « Wearing the himation: The garment is worn either alone or over a chiton/ketoneh. The himation is worn draped about the body from shoulder to ankle. A. One end of the garment is thrown over the left shoulder to hang between calf and ankle. B. The remaining material is brought around under the right arm, across the back and thrown over the left shoulder. C. The remaining material is draped along the length of the arm to hand down towards the left foot. ». It does not denote a small (face )cloth! Had YOU proceeded to a more thorough probing of the topic, you would have been aware that for a man 5”8” to 6’2” the himation should have been roughly 420cm long & 140cm wide, which is consistent with the roughly 440cm long & 120cm wide Turin Sindon. THIS IS BOTH A PHILOLOGICAL & ARCHAEOLOGICAL FACT. Additional textual pieces of evidence: in the Codex Vossianus Latinus, the Edessa Cloth is definitely not a small face cloth but a cloth in which. . . You can see [not only] the figure of a face, but [also] the figure of the whole body. 12th c. CE authors such as Ordericus Vitalis, Gervase of Tibury and the anonymous of “Latin Legend of Abgar” also unequivocally describe the Edessa (linen) cloth as having recorded Yeshua’s entire body. THESE ARE LITERAY FACTS. Oftentimes in Byzantine & Medieval iconography, Yeshua/Christ wears both burial/resurrectional himation over a chiton and himation alone/next to the skin (= achiton/sindon). See e.g. The Armenian miniature by Toros Roslin or Nicolas de Verdun’s 12th C. CE decorative panels (Entombment, Resurrection & Descent ino Hell scenes. Had YOU really been aware of the Byzantine iconographic burial/resurrectional himation of Christ, YOU would also have noticed its striking similarity with the iconogrzaphic long rectangular burial/resurrectional cloth Yeshua wears e.g. In the Resurrection mosaic of Hosios Loukas, 10th century CE.

If you really want to hear about and see BLOODSTAINS IN CONJUNCTION WITH YESHUA’S BURIAL/RESURRECTIONNAL SINDON/HIMATION, don’t look up in Byzantine literature & iconography, just look up for instance in: – Georgian literature (e.g. The 5th/8th c. CE “I, Joseph”); – Armenian iconography (e.g. Toros Roslyn’s mid 13thc. CE miniatures); – Latin iconography (e.g. 12th c. CE Pray Ms’ two iconographic sindons: one bearing Yeshua’s body with a mark above his right eye corresponding to the reversed `3′ bloodstain on the Turin Sindon (page III, ink drawings 3) and the other one schetchily featuring the left right side wound in conjunction with the letf right forearm double blood rivulet (page III, ink drawings 4). In Byzantine liturgy, by a pious fraud, the Holy Face of the Holy Mandylion was associated with the garden of Gethsemane scene implying the vision of Yeshua’s face stained with blood having perspired and trickled. Ring a bell? Although all the contradictory versions of the Abgar Legend shall not be taken literally, they contain a kernel of truth; a kernel you just missed as you DELIBERATELY keep ignoring all the versions that most obviouly contredict “your small face cloth thesis”. What do you make of the visual fact a vast nimbus like shaped light discolouration can be detected all around the Turin Sindon face not only on contrast enhanced orthochromatic, traditional silver & extensive digital Sindon overall photographs but also in situ cathedralis torinensis by standing at a distance between 15 to 30m away from the relic. NOTHING since it is contrary to your belief. What do you make of the visual fact a short portion decal of a text in Nestorian type of Syriac script can be detected on the area just below the beard from digitally contrast enhanced 1978 Schwortz Turin Sindon face photograph. NOTHING since it is contrary to your belief. The rare Greek word tetradilon only applied to Yeshua’s sindon/rakos (= old stained/soiled fabric) can be translated in THREE different way: folded/doubled in four folded/doubled four times onto itself – 4 x1 = four times longer than wide Notice the last translation can be applied to both a roughly 4m long x 1m wide current himation AND the Turin sindon but NOT to the roughly 55cm high x 40 cm wide. Mandylion. Yannick, can you REALLY/LOGICALLY account for the use of this specific word (tetradiplon) applied to a rakos/sindon receiving a facial imprint? (BTW This is the fourth time I am asking you).

(…)Maurus Green clearly state that the first two epitaphios that we know were created for a chapel in the Vatican during the papacy of Pope John VII (between 705 and 707) !!! ” Actually there are not two original epitaphioi but TWO 17th CE drawings of THE SAME Umbella as recorded by Grimaldi. Green (after Münz but before Bonnet Eymard) just MISTOOK Grimaldi’s two drawings of the same epitaphios for two distinctive epitaphioi and so did Yannick blindly following his “Green guru”! The fact also is we can share with I. Wilson serious doubts whether the Umbella’s appearance via Grimaldi’s two drawings could be genuinely compatible with an 8th c. CE date: the Crucified Yeshua is depicted with a loin cloth in the Umbella scene. Now “in the 8th c. CE and before, the commonest way to depict Yeshua was with him wearing a colobium, or long sleeveless robe as in John’s VII’s time in St Mary Antiqua Rome (see G; Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art) also in the Rabula gospels, also on the wall of Pope John VII’s chapel in St. Peter’s as copied by Grimaldi”. Yeshua’s loin cloth iconography only starts c. 1000 CE NOT BEFORE! “Besides, there is NO EVIDENCE for the “Veronica” itself (which Veronica exactly since there are couple of them + the Uronica?) the showing of which the Umbella is said to have ornemanted having been in Rome BEFORE c. 1000 CE.” “According to Grimaldi’s careful archiving, the shrine that housed this “Veronica”, the same shrine the window of which the Umbella ornemanted, bore an inscription ‘Pope Celestine III had this work done in the 7th year of his pontificate (…). Since Pope Celestine III’s pontificate was 1191 98, AGAIN the indications are that the Umbella did not date from the time of Pope John VII (i.e. 705 7 CE), but MUCH MORE LIKELY sometimes around the end of the 12th century CE.” Can we still UNCRITICALLY believe Yannick Clément?.","date":"2012-07-25","mins":"4:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers"},{"id":"comment-14201","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Correction: ” Yannick Clémet asking Matt not to believe me”.","date":"2012-07-25","mins":"4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers"},{"id":"comment-14222","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Yannick, as far as the “TWO” alleged “8th c.

Step by step, I’ll try to address your most pressing questions and make some effort to be a little more articulated as much as possible for once (not that easy while working on professional files and with only free time in snatches). Never mind. Let’s go! You write as “Fact #1 : Every known reproduction of the Mandylion ALWAYS represent a living Christ with his eyes wide open and without any signs of injuries, bruises or bloodstains. The most important thing to note is the fact that many of them were done during the time the relic was kept in Constantinople and publicly showed at least once a year, from 944 until 1090 (at least). Many of these copies were probably done by artists who were able to see the relic with their own eyes, or at least, who were able to get precise information about his physical aspect from eyewitnesses who had seen it in Constantinople. But despite that fact, absolutely none of these copies that have survived until this day represent a bloody and beaten Christ, easily associated with his Passion, the way we see it on the Shroud of Turin. If Wilson’s hypothesis is correct, WHY is this so ???” THE TRUE FACTS HERE ARE: 1/ Firstly, today’s viewer shall realise that whether in the 1st century CE or in Byzantine times, the Shroud face image could have been viewed animistically, that is, as a living presence and thus be aware of the theory of animism as people in ancient times instinctively saw images as quasi living beings. Such an animism is TOTALLY CONSISTENT with the coming into existence (4th 12th century CE) of Christ’s faces copies and representations of the Turin Shroud (TS afterward) face all depicting Yeshua’s with his eyes wide open to evoke not so much his death or death mask than his divine nature as resurrected Christ. The Abgar legend shall be read in this light and so the Holy Mandylion reproductions. 2/ not only have a few reproductions of the Mandylion but also of the Keramidion/Keramion & the Sindon reached us… 3/ the vessel/reliquary table (60cm high x 45cm wide x 8cm deep) of the Holy Face of the Holy Mandylion was in the Paris Saint Chapel till the Revolution. Its precious stones were despoiled and its gold gilt trellis melted. 4/ in Byzantine times, each of the three famous relics was kept in a characteristically gold gilt trellised vessel/reliquary table with a central occulus on the front side so as to see the Holy face. Both the Mandylion’s and Keramidion/Keramion’s vessel were about square shaped whereas the Sindon’s was double square/gold rectangle like shaped. When seen in mosaics, frescoes and miniatures, it is most currently overlooked by Shroud searchers that, with no scale indication, each of the representation of the three relics kept within their reliquary can look alike or almost alike to the viewer. 5/ the Holy Face of the Mandylion (later known as the Holy Shroud of the Holy Veronica of Rome is now kept in Manoppello and known as the Holy Veil. That is most likely a very ingenuous copy of the Sindon face; very ingenuous in terms of half acheiropoetic and half man made “in rusted natural template” of Yeshua’s burial cloth death mask. It is a fine transparent Byssus.

In case the corpse is put to rest in extra height on one of its sides, by sheer gravity effect, remoistened blood can rivulet into a drop when meeting an obstacle (such as head flowers, plants or other solid objects laterally pressed onto the body)… (See e.g. TS left elbow). Yannick you also wrote: “Sorry but we don’t need speculation here to understand that the region of the face of the Shroud could not have been the only one exposed to air, dust and sunlight FOR CENTURIES, since there’s absolutely no chemical or physical proofs of such an exposition.” THE WHOLE IMAGE WAS EXPOSED TO AIR, DUST AND SUNLIGHT FOR CENTURIES? THIS IS NOT ONLY PURE SPECULATION THIS IS FALSE. The TRUE FACT is, most of the time, it was kept either hidden or within a reliquary. As both a secret and most sacred relic, it was very rarely publicly displayed both in Parthian and Byzantine times (only once ot twice a year).

No doubt about that. This is called “a fact” my friend and sorry but that doesn’t leave any place for doubt. Not in my mind at least! “. About dirt and dust, you’d better reread what a Byzantine emperor wrote in 958 CE… The relics were regularly remoistened with water (during the Holy Week and in times of war or great dangers.

(The true facts, continuation + a few pieces of evidence) 6/ in 730 CE, in his Apologetic Treatises against those Decrying the Holy Images, John of Damascus described the Image of Edessa as a himation. 7/ A himation is an ankle length cloak/garment. It can be made of wool or heavier drape (winter/autumn wear), linen and cotton. In Arabic, the word mandul < Byzantine Greek mandylion) translates as scarf, turban, face towel/veil. Since the Holy Mandylion was a fine transparent sea Byssus face veil, it just cannot be the 3/1 twill weave long rectangular Turin Shroud (see the pre 1618 century CE Sancto Vultus Veronicae Sudario of Rome aka the Manoppello Veil). 8/ The Greek himation when used alone (i.e. Without a ketoneh/chiton) as work wear, summer wear or evening/nightwear was called an achiton. Oftentimes in Byzantine & Medieval iconography, Yeshua/Christ wears both himation over a chiton and himation alone (= achiton). 9/ « wearing the himation: The garment is worn either alone or over a chiton/ketoneh. The himation is worn draped about the body from shoulder to ankle. A. One end of the garment is thrown over the left shoulder to hang between calf and ankle. B. The remaining material is brought around under the right arm, across the back and thrown over the left shoulder. C. The remaining material is draped along the length of the arm to hand down towards the left foot. » FIRST EVIDENCE: had Davor Aslinosky et al proceeded to a more thorough probing of the topic, they would have been aware that for a man 5”8” to 6'2” the himation should be roughly 4.2m long & 1.4m wide i.e. Exactly the same long rectangular shape and roughly the same size as the Turin Shroud 440cm long &115cm wide. SECOND EVIDENCE: had Davor Aslinosky et al really been aware of the Byzantine iconographic himation of Christ, they would have notice its striking similarity with a long rectangular cloth.

Il n’est donc autre que le quasi calque sémantique de l’italien è la Bocca de la Vérità, littéralement “[c’]est la Bouche de la Vérité”, expression applicable, au Moyen Âge, à un témoin digne de foi et véridique. Or dans tout le Nouveau testament, et plus précisément dans l’Apocalypse, seul le Christ, “revêtu d’un vêtement [de lin] trempé dans le sang [de sa mort sacrificielle sur le bois de la croix]” est désigné comme “témoin fidèle et véridique” (Apo. 19, 12). Ainsi ce mot, jusque là non élucidé, peut il renvoyer à la fois au Christ et à son Linceul. Quant à la Bocca della Verità, “La Bouche de la Vérité”, elle fait référence à ce médaillon de marbre de Phrygie (l’actuelle Turquie), de grand diamètre (175 centimètres), orné du masque érodé par le temps et d’aspect relativement terrifiant du Titan Océan, le père des fleuves qui y apparaît sous les traits d’un homme barbu, chevelu et cornu la bouche, les narines et les yeux évidés et creux.

CE Roman, Byzantine and Medieval Christological iconography issue and imposed their biased views (see e.g. On the Pray codex miniatures). Sadly (my personal experience), I have seen a religious scholar (not a Mishnaic exegete),and a laser engineer (with a laser physicist as general coordinator) whose specific field of expertise was not ‘quite really’ Second Temple Mishnaic exegesis, Jewish numismatics and/or archaeological late antique image analysis and/or cryptanalysis, allegedly/wishfully “PEER” review (!!!!!!!) my research paper on the coin on eye issue that was at the very cross road of the four specific fields of expertise… Although I hadn’t practiced both oral and written English Language for nearly a quarter of a century (1994 2010) at the time (2010), I wrote up my paper in snatches, in my spares times and in less than 10 hours. The reviewers proved far from being specialists… Here is a sample of the reviewers’ wishful thinking even in terms of plain English language (email I sent to Paolo di Lazzaro): “THE RIGHT TO REPLY or Eppure ha senso… by French Galileo of Shroud Science, Max Patrick Hamon ; ) DEAR PAOLO, so that you could knowingly judge for yourself, just allow me to give you here a few samples of the two referees’ purple patches of most specious allegations and criticisms on my paper form and content. – Part I – 1 ST SAMPLE of Referee # 1’s wishful thinking (ON MY PAPER FORM) • Referee # 1 writes: ” PAGE ONE: line – Keywords – Proponency – Cannot find this in any English dictionary. I believe he means to make a new name based on propound/proponent. Advocacy is the correct word. Line – 1. SCEPTICAL PROPONENCY – Change to ADVOCACY. ” • Plain Facts: “Proponency” (see e.g. Wiktionary) is a most well known word in British English not only to educated people but also on internet (35,700 results!). It is also known to poets who are familiar with English rhyming dictionaries. (DEAR PAOLO, DON’T YOU THINK THESE FACTS ARE IN RATHER CURIOUS CONTRAST WITH REFEREE’S # 1’S OPINION?). • My comments: Actually both “Advocacy” and “Proponency” are correct. Proponency IS a genuine English word which most unfortunately is totally unknown to referee # 1. To be an American English native speaker is a necessary condition, although not sufficient, to guarantee lack of ignorance of the English language. • My first question to Referee # 1: Did she/he really mean “[I meant] to make a new name (sic)” that has existed in the English language for centuries and is still very much used nowadays? • My subsequent question to Referee # 1: Did she/he really think American English vocabulary should prevail on any other lexical variety of the English language? • My take: Since there is neither rhyme nor reason to it, Referee # 1 is neither an English language specialist nor a… poetess/poet! • My give: …AND ONE EGG TO PUT IN REFEREE # 1’S FACE!

This is to GRATUITOUSLY induce the burial cloth was just loosely draped over and not wrapped around Yeshua’s body and therefore his burial to have been incomplete. This in blatant contradiction with John 19:40 “They took the body of Jesus and wounded/wrapped it in linen cloths along with spices, according to the burial custom of the Judeans.” Is Daveb WNZ used to just drape over burial sheets over a corpse in a very awkward position due to rigor mortis and not even try to counteract the latter through tightly wrapping up the corpse? This would be in blatant contradiction with the halakha (Judean corpus of religious. Laws). There are also signs the body once wrapped up was turned and laid on its right side during the image formation process (my archaeological blood pattern analysis of the blood droplets and butterfly wings and shooting star like shaped hematic constellations on the non body image area). The most likely position of the body during the Sindon Image formation process is laying on its side. Now I am asking Daveb WNZ this very simple question: since most of the Second Temple period Judean burials even in time of peace were done in a relative haste on the very day of death, shall we automatically infer that most of them were incomplete as such? In other terms, does the phrase “buried according to the burial of the Judeans” means an incomplete burial or a complete one?

The material that resembled bloodstains was quite different. These facts seemed to eliminate any image formation hypothesis that was based solely on the flow of a liquid into the cloth. This also suggests that, if a body was involved in the image formation, IT WAS DRY AT THE TIME THE COLOR FORMED.” Meditate on that FACT for a while and add to this the fact that STURP wasn’t able to detect on the cloth any substances that was known to be used in ancient burial rites (like olive oil, aloes, myrrh, etc.) !!! Look, even normal human sweat was not detected at all by STURP on the Shroud !!! The data from STURP really seem to indicate that the cloth AND the body had not been soaked with any known burial products in a liquid form. The true fact is the image just cannot “SOLELY” be based on “the flow of a liquid into the cloth”. This does not rule out at all the image formation hypothesis of an in soaked linen cloth having been DRIED UP through a purifying ritual… To really shift from mere theorical to experimental archaeology as far as the Sindon Man burial reconstruction is concerned, what is most needed is a full body silicone medical mannequin realistic replica of the Sindon Man with water chamber (to be filled with heated water to simulate body and body hyperthermia temperatures) and fully jointed neck, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles (to provide a deathlike range of similar rigor mortis positions) + 3 4 sets of ad hoc linen cloths (both medieval and late antique replicas)..","date":"2012-08-13","mins":"5:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/09/off-topic-is-consciousness-fundamental/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Consciousness Fundamental?

The red brick and white roundel motifs can be read two ways: – The three brick red roundels on the left (inside wing of a reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of Sophia (Greek for Wisdom) and her three holy daughters Pistis, Elpis, and Agape (Greek Faith, Hope and Charity) whereas the four three brick red roundels (on the right side wing of the reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of the four “cardinal” virtues: dikaiosyne (Greek for justice), phronesis (Greek for prudence), sophrosyne (Greek for temperance), and andreia (Greek for courage). [Reminder: the 13th 14th c. CE word Baphomet is the atbash encoded word Sophia (see Schonfield) and my own my finding: the Hebrew etymology of Baphomet (Ba phéo émet, “In–His Mouth is the Truth”) as refering to: –Yeshua as “the truthful witness, the first of the dead to be born to life, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins with his own blood” (see Revelation 5:1) –A most famous bearded human face called “La Bocca della Verità” or “the Mouth of Truth” (in Cosmedin church 6th century CE, Rome). –The Sindon face (once kept in Constantinople now in Turin).] – The three brick red roundels on the left (inside wing of the reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) whereas the four three brick red roundels (on the right (inside wing of the reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of the four orthodox Christian cardinal virtues: agape (Greek for selfless love), eleos (Greek for mercy), thysia (Greek for sacrifice), and diakonia (Greek for service).

Most curiously NON QUALIFIED EXPERTS’ non authoritative opinions in the 5 main relevant fields of expertise and/or approaches here involved (namely palaeography, numismatics, botany, archaeological image analysis and cryptanalysis), still do prevail in the Shroud world nowadays as such opinions by Guscin (a linguist), Schwortz (a technical photographer), Nicoletti, (an Art historian), Di Lazzaro (a laser physicist) and Murra (a laser engineer) are currently promoted via articles, Dan Porter’s blog posts and conference papers. Now these Shroud researchers have definitely not the trained eye & brain to authoritatively decide whether or not any writings and/or solid object very faint imprints are ghostly recorded on the linen cloth as they are all too prone, as non qualified experts, to be the victims of negative pareidolie (“I think I don’t sees/I don’t think I sees”) when it comes to forms, signs and images there are not familiar with. Reminder as a telling tale example of a pseudo authoritative misleading opinion on ghost writings, Barry Schwortz wrote (see Dan Porter’s blog November 23, 2009 entry): “To make matters worse, Marion and Courage based all of their imaging work solely on the 1931 Giuseppe Enrie photographs.” This is total disinformation. The true fact is (late) Pr. Marion and Ms Courage based their research work on BOTH 1931 Enrie’s and 1978 Miller’s Sindon face photograph (see their book). Barry also wrote: “As for the Marion and Courage inscriptions themselves, these were carefully evaluated from a linguistic point of view in 1999 by Shroud scholar and language expert, Mark Guscin”. The very fact both (late) Pr. Marion & Ms Courage did misread a few ghost inscriptions/writings does not necessarily imply (as suggested by Barry’s article), there is no ghost inscriptions/writings on and around the Sindon face at all. Contrary to Italian palaeographer, Pr. Aldo Marastoni who did identify a few Latin and Greek ghost inscriptions/writings around and on the Sindon face, French optic engineer, (late) Pr. André Marion and French computer science expert, Thierry Castex who both did confirm the presence of such ghost inscriptions/writings on the linen cloth, neither Schwortz nor Guscin are a palaeographer, a papyrologist, an epigraphist and/or an optic engineer. As a mere linguist (and no matter how talented he may be as such), Guscin’s opinion on THE PRESENCE OR THE ABSENCE of ghost palaeographic inscriptions/writings on the linen cloth is, first and foremost, that of a non qualified expert in both optic engineering, computer science and palaeography and should be taken as such. The same applies to Schwortz’s as a mere technical photograph (no matter how talented he may be as such). The true facts are mostly non qualified experts’ opinion (whether for or against the real presence of such ghost writings and solid object very faint imprints) still do prevail nowadays in the Shroud literature of all persuasion as qualified experts’ most scarce presentation of their findings should be better refined in order to really help the non initiated eye to see.

Shall I remind you both Schwortz and Lynn are definitely NEITHER archaeological image analysts and cryptanalysts NOR ancient blood pattern analysts? Here is two extracts from my 2011 Torun paper entitled Turin Shroud: The Third face of the coin on eyes issue Or A Full Reappraisal of Intriguing Tiny Bloodstain Patterns: “AS A PRELIMINARY APPROACH, we shall use here a set of rhetorical questions to probe the optical and numismatic potential of the linen clothe in connection with the coin on eyes issue. Hopefully, the real quality of both arch sceptics’ and arch advocates’ main opinions and reasoning will emerge in the following and help the reader to judge for himself on more solid and objective grounds. 1/Are there any button like protrusions over the eyes in the 3 D Shroud images? From 3 D reconstructions of a close up of the Shroud face, three eminent forensic medical examiners [namely Pr. Buckling, Pr. Baima Bollone and Pr. Zugibe]1 and four computer science experts (among whom a 3 D image analyst) [namely Mottern, Halarick, Pr. Tamburelli and Pr. Balossino] confirmed the finding, by the American physicist John Jackson, of flat somewhat rounded foreign solid object imprints on the eye areas. Unless one can demonstrate the eight researchers’ intersubjectivity, this is a rather well established optical and “extra anatomical” fact. Actually the whole problem the Shroud researchers were facing was to correctly identify the said object imprints. In 1978, the late American theologian, Francis Filas, submitted a photographic enlargement (a third generation reversed photonegative copy) of the right eye area to the American professional numismatist and Greek classical coin expert, Michael Marx. The latter could then identify the possible reading of “UCAI” – between 9.30 and 11.30 o’clock – as a fragment of the full Greek legend TIBEPIOY KAICAPOC, ″of Tiberius Caesar″, that appears on the obverse side of a small Roman colonial bronze coin 15.5 16mm in diameter minted under the authority of the prefect of the province of Judea, Pontius Pilate (26 36 CE). Between 29 32 CE, two small bronze coin types, a “dilepton” and a “lepton” featuring a “lituus” (short curved wand used by Roman priests to foretell the future) and a “simpulum” (libation bail with angular shaft and handle) on their respective obverse side, were actually minted under the authority of Pontius Pilate. Both coin types bear the Greek legend TIBЄPIOY KAICAPOC, ″ [coins] of Tiberius Caesar ″. In the 80’s of the past century, some Shroud researchers who were neither professional numismatists, nor archaeological image analysts or cryptanalysts or even familiar with late ancient Greek alphabets, claimed to have found half a dozen lituus dilepta (Greek plural of dilepton) showing a rounded U (without a tail) substituted for an upsilon (Y) and a lunate sigma (C) for a kappa (K) by a die maker confusing his Latin and Greek in the legend TIBЄPIOY KAICAPOC. 2/ Are misspellings such as TIBЄPIOU CAICAPOC or TIBЄPIOY CAICAPOC really to be found on extant Pilate coins? In actual numismatic fact, the claimed misspellings cannot be observed on any extant Pilate coins. They are only due to misreading inscription fragments on much worn out coins. This is pretty obvious from the following figure (figure 4) presenting the three alleged “best specimens”. In spite of my deep respect for Filas’, Whanger’s and Moroni’s pioneering work5, their “coin legend misspelling theory” shall therefore be dismissed here as totally erroneous. Actually the reading of the “UCAI” like fragmentary tiny inscription on the right eye area from authentic (first generation) reversed orthochromatic film or slide copies of the Shroud face and 3 D image enlargements can be specifically associated with the same reading “UCAI” embedded within the inscription KAICAPOC on tens of existing Pilate coins minted in the 16th, 17th and 18th regnal year of Tiberius. This is a spy numismatic detail. Here are a few examples (figure 5): In the hypothesis the impression on the right eye area would have been left by an ancient coin 2/3 the size of an average fingerprint: 3/Would not the Turin Shroud’s three up, one down twill weave linen fabric have been far too coarse to resolve the average 1.5mm high letters on such a small coin? The Shroud thread count is 38 lengthwise (warp) threads of 0.14mm in average diameter and 26 widthwise (weft) threads of 0.25mm in average diameter woven into a measured one centimeter square of the shroud fabric6. The 0.5cm Shroud body image resolution limit should not be mistaken for the 0.5mm Shroud blood imprint resolution limit that is also the visual resolution limit. Now – and contrary to the body image – it should be here emphasized that the intriguing faint and very tiny faint brown letter grouping like patterns on the right eye area do appear photographically positive like the blood stains on the linen cloth. If we apply the Occam razor principle (i.e. If we try to give the simplest explanation to account for sharply defined appearance of the very tiny impressions), in the light of a funeral custom, it might well be the kind of incomplete decal or tell tale sign a coin manipulated with blood stained fingertips and placed over the right eyelid of the deceased is expected to leave on the internal upper side of a shroud soaked with a watery solution and pressed to the face. This has been demonstrated by experiments [Rodante’s and Moroni’s] (see figure 6) and just bypasses the theoretical objection that the threads would be too large to show this type of faint brown tiny letters on the Shroud face image.” If any interested to see my paper research extract 6 illustrative figures, I can sent them by email to Dan’s to publish them on his blog along with the corresponding extract..","date":"2012-12-10","mins":"10:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-20139","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Therefore metrologically, optically and experimentally speaking, nothing at all precludes a 1.5mm high letter resolution blood decal to have been left on the facial image by a Pilate coin 16mm± 0.5mm in average diameter..","date":"2012-12-10","mins":"11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-20147","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"(contination, second extract) 4/ Can the reading of “UCAI” on the Shroud be a “mere figure in clouds” due to the photographic procedure, the computer processing or the variegations on the linen cloth? If we take a glance at digitized 2 D reversed photographic enlargements of the right eye area from 1931 Giuseppe Enrie’s, 1978 Vernon Miller’s and 2002 Gian Carlo Durante’s photo negative of the Shroud face, the same letter grouping like shapes can be detected (though as if a little bit out of focus on both Miller’s and Durante’s compared to Enrie’s). This means it is not an artefact of a certain photographic procedure as it can be depicted by photographs shot in different techniques whether orthochromatic, traditional silver and extensive digital (See figure 7, Photographic enlargement comparison of the right eye area from 5 Shroud face reversed photonegatives). The letter images are not apparent on 1978 Schwortz’s and 1997 Durante’s Shroud face photograph just because of the use of two different lighting techniques. In 1978, Schwortz lit the Shroud from the front so as to minimize weave appearance to invisibility thus causing some already faint bloodstain patterns nearly standing out on the Shroud fabric to technically disappear from the photographs. In 1997, the “UCAI” sequence orientation happened to be nearly aligned with the incoming light direction thus causing a form of obfuscation from illumination to occur. As far as 2 D to 3 D conversion by digital processing is concerned in terms of reduction in the weave pattern and increased sharpness of image, it must be noted that no additional graphic data can be found in a resulting 3 D image from an authentic (first generation) orthochromatic film or slide copy, had not the graphic information been integral to the original 2 D image8. The letter grouping like shapes are thus clearly distinguishable from the vagaries of the weave (see figure 8, Digitized reversed photographic enlargement of the right eye area from: (a) authentic orthochromatic film copy; (b) Tamburelli’s digitized 3 D image; (c) 3 D visualization within a maximum 16 mm diameter area). If the reading of “UCAI” had really come from the banding, both vertical and horizontal, encroaching on the area of the right eye, or been a mere “figure in clouds” on 1931 Enrie’s, 1978 Miller’s, 2002 Durante’s Shroud face photographs and 1981 Tamburelli’s 3 D reconstructions of the said area, how come then the same “figure in clouds” can be also seen – visually embedded within the inscription KAICAPOC as a spy numismatic detail – on tens of existing Pilate coins minted in the 16th, 17th and 18th regnal year of Tiberius (see Fig. 5)? The photographic, eidomatic and numismatic evidence offers therefore a complete rebuttal against the “mere figure in cloud theory”8. 5/ Can Enrie’s black and white orthophotographs of the Shroud face taken eighty years ago on large glass plate negatives still yield usable and accurate information? Besides mechanical squeeze and 3 D scanning, it is common knowledge, among archaeological analysts and cryptanalysts that the best aids for deciphering purposes of 3 D encoded ancient images and inscriptions invisible or almost invisible to the naked eye are applying false colour, 2 D to 3 D conversion and digital squeeze of photographs taken under appropriate raking light. 1931 Enrie’s Shroud face orthophotographs are not simply very aesthetic as some Shroud researchers would too hastily think. Mostly because of a longer time exposure under appropriate raking light and the use of specially designed filters which enhance local contrast, they did capture the finest details of the Shroud face image and haematic (or blood) imprints along with the characteristic weave pattern and the folds and creases of the linen fabric at scales 1:1 and 2:3. As such and regardless of 2008 HAL9000’s high definition digital photograph that should allow researchers* to analyse the Shroud in unprecedented detail, Enrie’s reversed negatives and positives are still the best candidates available so far (along with 2002 Durante’s digital photograph of the Shroud face as double or triple check) for detecting and studying any possible 3 D encoded blood stained coin tiny patterns embedded in the suspected image areas. Enrie’s photographs do yield usable and accurate information even more modern photographs fail to do. This is made pretty obvious with the photographic enlargement comparison of the right eye area from Shroud face photographs shot in different techniques (see Fig. 7)..","date":"2012-12-10","mins":"1:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/06/secrets-of-the-shroud-what-say-you-all/","cat":"history","title":"Secrets of the Shroud:  What say you all?"},{"id":"comment-20165","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"YC, Shall I endlessly repeat neither Lynn nor Schwortz are qualified experts in the fields of professional numismatic, paleography, archeological image analysis and cryptanalysis or/and ancient blood pattern analysis?

According to me, the Latin baffometus that can be trancripted in French baffomet/baphomet, comes from the medieval Hebrew phrase ba pheo emet, “in his mouth is the Truth”. This can allude at one and the same time to Yeshua as “la Bocca della Verità” (see Revelation), the already famous “Bocca della Verità” in Rome (literally “the Mouth of Truth” in Italian, an ancient stone mask from the Classical period that represents the river god Okeanos with an open mouth, wide eyes and a flowing mane of hair much like both Yeshua’s Holy Face of the Veronica Veil (also in Rome) and that of the Holy Face of the Holy Hemation/Sindon (i.e. Yeshua’s burial Sindon kept “tetradiplon” within a wooden reliquary table or monstrance so as to leave only the face visible through a vast circular central opening on front side). The true visual fact is both the Holy Face of the Holy Veronica (now in kept in Manoppelo) once combined with the Holy Face of te Holy Shroud/Sindon does look like the terrifying mask of La Bocca della Verità in Rome. Now both the Greek word Sindon and the medieval Latin Signum can be translated Synne/Sydoine in old French and specifically refer to Yeshua’s burial cloth.

This cryptographic art is known as steganography and dates back as early as the 5th century BCE. The Pray codex Hungarian Benedictine monk artist’s steganographic signature at least appears twice within two of his 5 pen & ink miniatures: – First in cursive uppercase letters (medieval script) embedded into the burial sheet lower folded line (upper section, anointing scene miniature) and reads ‘ALMOS’. – Then in cursive lower case letters (medieval script) as ‘a lmos’ embedded into the profiled face hidden into the first mary ‘s sleeve and read in conjunction with the “a”. – Beside, at first sight, the face hidden into the first Mary ‘s sleeve is to identify the latter as ‘Mary of Joseph’. Now in Hebrew Yossef can mean “(HE) ADDS UP”, which is totally consistent here BOTH with ‘a face being ‘added up’ to the sleeve and the Benedictine monk’s signature ‘almos’ being ‘added up’ to the scene in conjunction with the name ‘Jozsef’. – Finally, if we take a very close look, the face in the sleeve is seen with the eyes shut. This is the clinch to confirm our deciphering as his first name/surname/family name, ÁLMOS/almos, is the very Hungarian name of the legendary founder of Hungary, meaning “dreamy; sleepy” or, according to folk etymology, “the Dreamt One/Child.” Hence, if my deciphering is correct the miniaturist name would be no other than JÓZSEF ÁLMOS..","date":"2013-03-18","mins":"8:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/18/the-curious-a-in-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"history","title":"The Curious ‘a’ in the Hungarian Pray Manuscript"},{"id":"comment-27886","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"In he miniature field, the added up lower case open letter “a” (reading disconnected as “c i” with non flattened top) stands for “apocalipsis ihesu christi” (a + ci/ic), “revelation of jesus christ”;.","date":"2013-03-20","mins":"6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/18/the-curious-a-in-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"history","title":"The Curious ‘a’ in the Hungarian Pray Manuscript"},{"id":"comment-27925","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Donn, the hand gesture (with six fingers) is referring to Yeshua who in the sixth day, and at the sixth hour, was nailed to the Cross (see Eastern monk’s prayer of the sixth hour + Origen + Hand gesture medieval symbolism)..","date":"2013-03-20","mins":"2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/18/the-curious-a-in-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"history","title":"The Curious ‘a’ in the Hungarian Pray Manuscript"},{"id":"comment-27907","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"1192 1195 c.

SVAIRE IHV = SVAIRE Ih ESV, Old French phrase for “Shroud of Jesus”.

In conjunction with the broken border lined (“bordure brisée”) coat of arms of Jeanne de Vergy( Mirebeau) (“de gueules à trois quintefeuilles d’or”), we can read a “U” letter in Gothic script. It is the initial letter for U[ergy]/Vergy. BTW Wison wrote: “ON THE PARIS BADGE we see Geoffroi de Charny’s coat of arms on the left and Jeanne de Vergy’s on the right, while on the Machy badge these positions are reversed.” Actually Geoffroi de Charny’s coat of arms is at “dextre” as seen featured ON THE RELIQUARY KEEP featured on the Paris badge. This makes a lot of a difference. It means the RELIQUARY KEEP (that is not to be mistaken either with the empty tomb seen in a roundel of glory topped with a cross of Triumph and the “crown of thorns”/circlet of rushes) was made when Geoffroy of Charny was still alive while the badge in se, most likely dates back to late 14th early 15th c.

Two other letters, half visible, appear on either side of the coats of arms, under the pillars.

As early as the 1st century CE, YôHanan/John in his Book of Revelation associated the chain (and key) motif with Yeshua in his glory as both ‘crucifixion victim’ and ‘sacrificial lamb’ “wearing a garment soaked with blood” (Rev. 19:13). Had e.g. CB read it and been a true archaeo(crypto)logist, he couldn’t have missed the ‘sindonocryptographic hint’ in Yeshua being described via John’s mystic vision as “the messenger (sent by G.od) having THE KEY of the bottomless pit, and A GREAT CHAIN IN HIS HANDS” (Rev. 20:1) as “he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the devil, and satan, and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit” (Rev. 20: 2 7). (As an archaeopareidolic vision, a chain like shaped blood twin rivulets along with a key like shaped can be unconsciously or deliberately misperceived as ‘chain and key’ on the TSM’s left forearm and hand areas and even be associated with the chain like shaped blood flow on the small of the back area. A good trick if you want to initiate your eye and brain coordination system to see it (“primary visualisation”), just squint through semi closed eyelids) Can CB now figure out the dragon/crocodile and Yeshua laying hold of it to bind him? (The only snag is CB is definitely NOT a ‘crypto Christian, hagiographic, ‘hagiomysteric’ and Graalic ‘dormant imaginary’ specialist). As I wrote nearly one year ago on this very blog (see my posting on February 28, 2012 at 6:58 am | #6) : “John’s Revelation can be read in cryptic conjunction i.e. In “primary visualisation” with the Shroud image as oversized Rorschach.

Methinks neither HF nor Lde F (who keep criticiszing the archaeological thought experiment) and connot even substantiate their negative aprioristic opinion, are totally unable to really separate good archaeology from pseudoarchaeology. When was it last time HF or Lde F have atempted to dress in a set of clothing used as shrouds a real human body? Do they real think the TS shroud was still in the empty tomb and the Johannine soudarion can only refer to a PRE burial napkin? Methinks they are enslaved to exegetical presuppositions and Are HF and Lde F even aware that the Johannine word “soudarion” is not derived from the Latin sudarium but from the Aramaic sudara (the latter is used several times in the Palestinian Targums of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh and refers to an all enveloping wrap or cloak (used to sleep in too). It is a phonetic NOT a semantic equivalent! The Kornelimünster “Sudarium” (whether a genuine relic or a substitute replica of the sudara that was used as an all envelopping shroud (6.15×3.52m) and was the one left rolled up onto itself on the stonebench of cave tomb sole burial vaulted? Regarding Lazarus’s “soudarion” (John 11:44), are HF & Fde L even aware , that the Greek ê opsis does not refer at all to the face but to Lazarus’s “external appearance, form, or shape Because of their philological and Chrsitolipsological blind spots, just focus on the Oviedo Sudarium and Turin Shroud and keep overlooking other Christic contact relics (whether genuine ones or replicas) such as the Cahors Headdress (a bloodstained skull cap), the Kornelimüsnter Sindon Munda (half of a larger sindon), the Kornelimünster Sudarium Domini etc. A REAL SHAME indeed! They cannot even discriminate between a napkin used as a PRE burial shroud (Oviedo Sudarium) and clean white burial clothings used as shrouds (Turin Shroud, Cahors Headdress, Kornelimünster Sindon Munda and Sudarium Domini)! When was it last time the alleged “specialists” attempted to dress a real body in shouds the same size and shape as the still extant Christic contact relics to reconstruct Yeshua’s dressing in shrouds on his burial? Are they authorities/”High Priests” in Second Temple period archaeology or history? whatis their real authorities? They are just recycling exegetical presuppostions done by others and just cannot mistake contradictory exegesese for archeaological truth. A real shame! Methinks the Science of the Earth high school teacher and the free lance journalist should take more seriously extant relics and/or replicas of Yeshua’s set of clothing used as shrouds. Indeed a new field of expertise (“Christolipsology” in terms of research and studies of Christic relics and/or replicas) should shake a good many scholarly or pseudo scholarly presuppositions based on contradictory hermeneutics. Each of HF and Lde F “pet conservative exegesis” is not the absolute truth, far from it.

Neither HF nor Lde F took the trouble to delve into the real thing as I did and still do as far as Yeshua’s burila is concerned.

Actually it is just a matter of common sense (NOT guesswork!). In Ruth 3:15, Boaz gives her six measures (a biblical measure of dry goods) of barley in her “covering, –all envelopping shawl,cloak” Heb. Mitpa Hat, Aram. Sudara). “And (Boaz) told Ruth, “Bring the shawl/covering you’re wearing and hold it out.” When she held it out, he shoveled six measures of barley into her shawl/covering;” Given one se’ah is 6.959 quart or 7.7 liters Could you tell me how six she’arim/measures of barley (= nearly 50 liters of barley given as a gift to Ruth) can fit in a kerchief or a napkin the size of the Oviedo Sudarium?

It is an all enveloping veil or shawl (Heb. Mitpa Hat, Aram. Sudara) made of byssum and proceeding from Antioch, Syria; a city that was one of the centres that were producing byssum fabrics in Antiquity. The Patriarch of Jerusalem presented it as a gift to Charles The Great and from 812 CE onward the Sudarium Domini was kept in the core of the Aachen Cathedral until Louis the Pious, one of Charles’s sons, gave it to Abbot Benedict of Anian of the Kornelimünster Abbey and since about 1829, it is kept in the parish church. R Re the Hebrew mitpa Hat and its Aramaic translation sudara, in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), it is rendered by the French word, “châle” (in English, “shawl”) not “scarf” (Aramaic/Syrac = mindil).

Although his opinion is much in your line, it shall be received with caution as Poulle was not a pure byzantinist. Résumé/Abstract L’enquête conduite sur les sources de l’histoire des reliques christiques avait pour premier objet de repérer celles d’entre elles qui pouvaient concerner le linceul de Turin, de façon notamment à fixer le vocabulaire employé. Il a ainsi pu être établi que l’assimilation souvent faite du linceul de Turin avec le mandylion venu d’Édesse à Constantinople en 944 était impossible, les deux reliques étant conservées simultanément à Constantinople à partir d’une date inconnue, peut être dès le 11e s. Les témoignages (tardifs) faisant état de l’image sur le mandylion d’un corps, et non du seul visage reposent sur une interprétation erronée d’un texte latin maintes fois repris à la fin du Moyen Âge. Les textes (en latin et en grec) sont cités avec un contexte suffisamment large pour en éclairer le sens, et ils sont traduits. Ils attestent la présence du linceul à Constantinople avant 1204..","date":"2012-04-16","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"id":"comment-10772","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"…relatively wrong or right or… right..","date":"2012-04-23","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"id":"comment-10773","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Take it easy….","date":"2012-04-23","mins":"4:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"id":"comment-12151","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Anoxie, you are right.
