This is to be related to the “floating” shroud legend. Ever heard of it? In French Medieval literature, see e.g. Perlevaus or the High Book of the Grail.The floating shroud theme also appears in Byzantine literature. Check for yourself. Colin Berry, David Mo and Ly Fe, you really need more than an eye opener to see!

Poulle only reviews Chevalier’s work. It’s not an article on the Shroud. I don’t have to demonstrate anything. The Shroud is medieval. It appeared in France in the middle of the XIV century. This is what all professional scholars think (apart from a couple of taliban Christians). Soldiers or knights were given fake relics. This was quite ordinary. The imprint of the buttocks of Jesus or the milk of the Virgin Mary. Relics were a big business at the time (and still now for the Catholic Church): they attracted pilgrims. They enriched the men of God. And don’t tell me the fairy tale of the Edessa image, an apocryphal legend debunked even by a pope. Last but not least, don’t forget about the other full 16 burial cloths of Jesus in the Middle Ages. All genuine. All venerated by they faithful at the same time. With the approval of the Church.Your assertion, as professional Church Historian, is that the TS is mediieval. My comment: – As a professional Late Antique and Medieval Archeaocryptologist, my contention is that the TS IS Late Antique (1st century CE). I can prove it on a rather solid collective ground (numismatics, iconology, literature, Second Temple Judean History & Archaeology etc). I am no Taliban/Student. I am a former university professor.

Can you tell instead the exact date of at least a couple among the 16 Medieval faked shrouds you mentionned. How can you tell for sure between a faked Christ Shroud and a copy from a possibly original Christ Shroud. What are you objective archeaological criteria. To be so assertive (It is a faked shroud) Thank you for a very detailed LEARNED reply You wrote: “Poulle only reviews Chevalier’s work. It’s not an article on the Shroud.” That’s a really good one! The work is about the Shroud History as perceived by Ulysse Chevalier, a scholar and a real intellectual crook when it comes to the objectivity of his Lirey Shroud file. Cannot you remember?

But if the bloodstains are painted and the body image came later the conclusion suggests itself: it is also manufactured. The artificiality of the bloodstains imply the artificiality of body mark. So I am certain that the image of the man of the shroud of Turin is printed by human hands. It is not natural or supernatural.” David Mo’s ignorance has no limits… He would rather read “What is the Sudarion” by César Barta and Mark Guscin, RILT n° 26. Then he would have read the most likely archaeological answer (experimentally checked by pratical simulation): “The physical existence of the Sudario of Oviedo and its utilisation for the pre funeral of the man of the Shroud, would […] explain by itself the position of the hair […]. The inclination of the head of the crucified (see Pray Ms upper section miniature spy detail) makes the locks fall in front over the cheeks (on the TS). The blood leaking off the wounds produced by a crown[/headdress] mixed with sweat and dust, make a substance that gives a certain stability to the hair. A soudarion around the head, like that of Oviedo, congeals the hair in its position, and after two hours the hair takes permanent disposition, which is not easy to modify.”.","date":"2012-06-21","mins":"6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12759","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"On Examiner.

CE Byzantine iconography CURRENTLY featuring the resurrected Christ dressed in himation (a large rectangular piece of fabric/cloth (sindon in Greek), about four times longer than wide (tetradiplon in Greek) and arranged around the body in a variety of different ways either as a warm cloak (of loosely woven thick wool) over a short chiton (a basic garment that covered the upper body and varying portions of the legs) or as an achiton (of tightly woven lighter fabric usually linen covering the upper body and varying portions of the legs) next to the skin (i.e.. Worn as a summer wear, spring wear, evening wear or work wear). Men normally wore the himation alone. Both so called historians & art historians seem to TOTALLY ignore this basic fact in terms of Greek and Greek Byzantine clothing. They also ignore that the large rectangular piece of fabric/cloth could be draped over one’s head to veil his face and cover both his arms with it. Had both so called historians & art historians been aware the upper left edge of a himation could also be used to wipe one’s face, they would have understood the reason why in the 7th c. CE, John Damascene e.g. Used this very word (himation) to describe the cloth that received the imprint of Yeshua’s face (the Image of Edessa). How come both historians & art historians just keep ignoring the Greek and Greek Byzantine clothing? Most obviously they TOTALLY missed the whole point here. Reminder for both so called historians & art historians: the Turin Sindon is about four times longer than wide and as such can be described both as a tetradiplon AND a himation (a large rectangular piece of fabric/cloth) NOT JUST as a small face cloth. In the different legendary versions, the receiving surface of the Image of Edessa is (either implicitly or explicitly) described BOTH as a small face cloth AND a large full body cloth. Why should the John Damascene’s version of the Abgar legend be TOTALLY ruled out just because the Greek word himation doesn’t fit at all with so called historians’ and art historians’ pre conceived ideas?

These facts seemed to eliminate any image formation hypothesis that was based solely on the flow of a liquid into the cloth. This also suggests that, if a body was involved in image formation, it was dry at the time the color formed.” #9: “Body fluids (other than blood) did not percolate into the cloth.” #10: “All of the observational methods agreed that no pigments, normal painting vehicles, or natural exudations (other than the blood) had been added to the cloth after its production.” #11: “Neither aloes or myrrh could be detected on the cloth.” Shall I endlessly repeat what I wrote on August 13, 2012 at 3:02 pm | #35? Ray Rogers was neither a Second Temple period archaeologist nor an archaeocryptologist. He never even thought the TSM could have been subjected to any specific burial ritual. What he coud at best thought is the TSM could have been subjected to the 1st c. CE Jerusalem cave tomb temperature early in Spring. He totally overlooked/ignored (at least) two possible archaeological parameters/scenarios that just cannot be totally ruled out here namely a purifying and drying out ritual implying the use of a fumigation (the Sindon being used as a long INNER burial cloth) and/or a corpse buried still in hyperthermia. Hence archaeo(crypto)logically speaking, his observations either could be or are biased. The true fact is Ray Rogers never explored 3 4 possible archaeological scenarios (fumigation of a tightly wrapped up corpse; corpse in hyperthermia; corpse fumigation associated with hyperthermia) through state of the art experimental archaeology.

Strangely enough, many many Christian professional and amateur “Shroud researchers” have theories while IGNORING the Greek version of the Gospels, the Judean funeral practice of the Second Temple period and… sheer common sense..","date":"2011-12-27","mins":"7:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/24/letter-from-joe-marino/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Letter from Joe Marino"},{"id":"comment-47401","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh, you wrote: “Dan’s and my honest opinions are that the face of the image “is really there,” and that the coins, flowers and letters “are really not there.” Atre you talking about what you THINK you don’t see?

On July 29, 2014 at 3:47 I quoted from a research paper (I have had no time to complete so far) entitled “The Hungarian Pray Ms Illuminated Parchment Folio 28r Lower Ink Drawing Section: LUMEN PASCHALIS” (Or The Constantinople Sindon Turin Shroud Camouflaged Into A Sarcophagus Box & Lid: An ‘Iconosteganalysis’), I wrote: Is the Turin Shroud the crux literaria of the Constantinople Sindon? Suffice it to syntactically piece together several corroborating 944 1207 CE testimonies and eyewitness descriptions, from Gregory Referendarius’ (Archdeacon of Hagia Sophia), to Nicholas Mesarites’ (overseer of the treasuries in the Pharos Chapel of the Boucoleon Palace of the emperors) via Robert de Clari’s (Fourth Crusade Picard knight), and a few others, to build a strong if not crucial evidence the Turin Shroud (TS hereafter) and Constantinople Sindon (CS hereafter) could be one and the same object. The literary synthesis reads: “[In the church of My Lady Saint Mary of the Pharos (“lighthouse”) in the Golden Imperial Palace of the Boucoleon in Constantinople and another church called My Lady Saint Mary of Blachernae], Christ ‘rise[d] again’ [then], and the sindon(1) with the burial linens [was] the clear proof. [This sindon] as white as snow from antiquity, [was] of linen, of easily obtainable material, remained uncorrupted and smell[ed] fragrant of myrrh. [It] def[ied] decay because, after the Passion, it [had] wrapped the elusive(2) dead naked body. [When] raised upright, not only the image of the glorious features of the Saviour’s face with dripping drops of blood shine[d] out but also the form and most noble stature of his entire body hanging down from the cross and embellished with drops of blood and water that make the liquid flow from his own side, could be plainly seen. This [was] not the art of the painter and the various beautiful colours, which provide a door for the mind to consider the original and depict images [that could possibly have depicted] the reflection of his appearance and size imprinted on [his sindon]. [So much so] the ‘not made by hand’ image of Christ and G od, draped with a white/pure linen cloth he had worn, was sufficiently in lieu of the vision of the Lord coming into the flesh to those who had not corporally seen him. After the city was taken, the French partitioned the relics of the saints and the most sacred of all, the sindon in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before his resurrection. We know the sacred sindon in Athens. [In this city] we saw with our own eyes the burial linen cloths found in the sepulchre.” This is strong historical evidence indeed and tends to prove the presence of the most famous contact and blood relic of Christianity at Constantinople prior to 1204. Notes: (1). – Also called sydoine and synne1 in old French; the latter for “sign” (Latin signum; Greek symbulos). (2). – Greek aperilepton, i.e. Consistent both on one hand with G od’s “un circumscribed”, non coercive and loving, divine nature that has no shapes, is beyond description and the binds of Death cannot contain and, on the other hand, Yeshua’s “un outlined”, evanescent nature of his own image on his sindon..","date":"2014-10-14","mins":"7:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/14/dj-vu-squared/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Déjà vu Squared"},{"id":"comment-7521","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"On Steve’s blog I read one blogger (“Deuce”) boyh asking & answering to his own quiery: “what do you make of Max Patrick Hamon’s argument, in reply to your comment on that thread, that Jackson’s theory can’t work because the image on the reverse side of the Shroud contains only the face and hands and not the rest of the body? Hamon attributes it to “more pressure” on the cloth by the hands and face.” Deuce immedialte adding: “Personally, I find Hamon’s idea problematic because if the reverse side image were the result of more pressure, then there should have been a *much stronger* image of Jesus’ back on the reverse side of the back image than there is of his face and hands on the reverse of the front side. After all, the back is the side of the Shroud he was laying on, with the full pressure of his body weight!” I would have hoped both Deuce and Steve had more carefully read what I wrote. I wrote; “…his (Rabbi Yeshua’s) tightly enshrouded stiff body was placed first on his left side and then on his right side (at head and knee level?) upon two stones and in extra height above a slab to be submitted to a myrrho aloetic fumigation.” During the image formation process, his body was not laying on his back (in a suspine position)!

Bucklin never studied the TS man’s double bloodied body imprint just for the time of a 10 minutes’ film sequence! Are PHPL and CB really/deliberately that naive? Bucklin wrote a research paper on 1981, i.e. Three years after the 1978 STURP expedition. Shall I repeat, until proven otherwise, in the late 70s and early 1980s CE, Bucklin based his TS man’s autopsies from both Enrie’s and Miller’s life sized negative and positive photographs + VP8 image analyser 3 D reconstructions. When it comes to the height of the TS man recorded on a 3:1 herringbone twill linen planar surface and estimated on different displays, points in time and techniques, it is not at all surprising it can vary from 174cm 182cm in average depending on the real field of expertise of each expert. This is one of few main disagreements as far as medical forensic is concerned. Don’t archsceptics make too much of it to misleadingly dismiss all the anatomo pathological datas that tell out the shroud wrap a real corpse/body, most likely of a crucifixion victim who was severely flogged, crowned with ferocious thorns, nailed, sidewounded. Reminder: in less than 3.5 years CB –who repeatedly claims to be an expert in biochemistry and chemistry– have had several most contradictory theories to account for the TS image and each time it was a scientific and archeaological dead end not to say total flop (no bloodstain recorded at all, remotely reminiscent object/body imprints).

On May 20, 2014 at 1:37 pm, I wrote: ” (Given that splicing, glueing and dying are part and parcel of invisible micro reconstructions, in 2007), I advocate(d) a modern (not a medieval) contamination (in the 1860s CE) through spliced “reweaving thread by thread” as variant to mere Medieval French reweaving + a first century CE contamination due to a purifying ritual (alkali solution in soaked linen wrapping the deceased followed by ritual fumigation to dry it out).” And on May 21, 2014 at 2:39 pm I also wrote: Re fingers clutching the main body of the shroud four inches away from the seam during bishops’ and canons’ displays with bare hands as the seam beaded side strip was used for a better handling of the cloth. Here is an excerpt from my 2007 paper: “Il faut, en effet, savoir que, lors des ostensions et afin de garantir aux observateurs présents la vision la plus parfaite et la plus logique de la double empreinte du Crucifié, la relique était déployée entièrement à l’horizontale. Une bande de couture bourrelée courant sur toute sa longueur avait été confectionnée permettant une meilleure préhension du drap. L’échantillon parent, extrait d’un seul tenant entre 8 à 10 cm du bord supérieur du coin gauche et le long de la couture de repli du tissu sur lui même, se superposait donc presque parfaitement à la zone où – depuis au moins le XI Ve siècle et jusqu’au XI Xe siècle – la grande étoffe de lin avait été tenue en tenaille entre le creux de la paume et trois ou quatre des doigts de la main droite de plusieurs générations de dignitaires ecclésiastiques officiant à mains nues. Ainsi, à cet endroit très précis du drap, la toile, tantôt soumise à de fortes tensions, a des replis et à des pressions répétées d’extrémités onglées plus ou moins coupantes, tantôt exposée aux griffures du chaton des bagues d’évêques et d’archevêques, avait elle fini, un jour, par être abrasée, accrochée, cisaillée et/ou trouée et faire l’objet d’une (voire même de plus d’une) micro reconstruction(s) fil à fil invisible(s) à l’œil nu hors examen ad hoc.” In other words, one shall take into account the impact of repeated fingernail (whether sharp or not) pressures on the sharply bent linen outermost edge through at least one hundred public private & expositions of the Lirey Nice Chambery Turin Shroud from 1355 to the 1860s, which is a fair estimate. Secondly and historically speaking (prior to the official radiocarbon dating), we only know for sure four Clare nuns (in 1534), Sebastian Valfré (in 1694) and Clothilde of Savoy Bonaparte (in the 1860s) did intervene on the Shroud. Now as a reminder, according to King Umberto II, “(…) at ONE POINT IN THE PAST (uppercases mine), the edges of the Lenzuoli (Sheet) had become so tattered as to cause embarrassment or criticism of the Custodians (most likely in the XI Xth c. CE i.e. After at least one hundred bare handed expositions; comment mine), and those areas were repaired and rewoven using identical techniques, but obviously with similar, yet newer, materials containing dyes and other medieval manufacturing ingredients, in an attempt to better blend the new sections in, as best possible, with the original fabric.” Re the TWO different types of micro reconstructions that could mainly account for the linen to appear medieval, on June 22, 2013 at 5:00 pm I posted an excerpt from my 2007 paper on the TS 1988 C14 dating fiasco (in French): “Non détection d’une zone (sinon deux) ayant subi des réparations invisibles à l’œil nu : Tout cet ensemble d’éléments directs et indirects constitue un faisceau d’indices concordants : il tend à témoigner, dans ladite zone plus raide et plus sombre, d’une intervention selon une technique bien particulière inspirée de la technique du « retissage à la française » (bien connue des maîtres tapissiers ainsi que des experts en histoire de la tapisserie) ; technique qu’il ne faut cependant pas confondre avec celle d’un simple « entissage » d’un patch médiéval, repérable, quant à lui, à l’œil nu et à la lumière naturelle du jour par un spécialiste. La technique dont il s’agit ici s’avère plus précisément celle d’un « retissage par épissures », sans coutures ni nœuds, effectuée, semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement. Elle demande beaucoup de patience et une grande dextérité des doigts. Elle consiste à mettre, tout d’abord, en place les fondations de base et la chaîne. Pour ce faire, soit le tisserand commence par identifier la matière des fibres constituant les fils de chaîne puis se les procure soit il utilise systématiquement des fibres de coton. Ensuite ces fibres sont filées afin d’obtenir l’épaisseur des fils originels puis entortillées avec précaution sur elles mêmes et sur place aux fibres des fils de chaîne extraites de la partie cachée du tissu à réparer. Des fils de remplacement de la trame sont alors placés par dessus et par dessous les fils de chaîne reconstitués puis les fibres sont entortillées sur elles mêmes, là encore avec précaution, aux fibres des fils de trame originels de façon à reproduire très exactement la texture ou le motif du tissu et refermer ainsi, sans faire de nœuds, le trou ou la zone sévèrement cisaillée. Pour finir de rendre cette restauration fil à fil tout à fait invisible et consolider les épissures, une teinture à base de gomme résineuse est appliquée localement sur la trame ainsi reconstruite pour que celle ci, d’où provient l’effet de texture ou de motif, se fonde dans l’original (en l’occurrence la toile jaunie par la patine ivoire des siècles). Cette intervention sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe, si elle est bien réalisée et bien dissimulée, peut réellement être invisible sur les deux faces d’une pièce d’étoffe au point d’échapper parfois même à la main et à l’œil exercés d’une personne du métier qui, à l’œil nu et sous une lumière inadéquate, a tendance à confondre ces reconstructions avec des irrégularités apparues au cours du tissage. De fait, la structure artisanale du lin originel du Linceul, son calibre assez fort ainsi que son tissage serré en chevron sont de nature à parfaitement intégrer ce type d’intervention. Quant à l’échantillon de Zurich (et partant « l’échantillon 1 d’Arizona ») tiré de la partie claire de la bande C14 officielle du Linceul, celui ci bien que ne présentant apparemment pas ou très peu de trace de contamination par une quelconque teinture14, n’en devait pas moins être recouvert d’une patine de microorganismes. De par l’aspect anormale de la zone où il fut prélevé, il suggère fortement, en tout cas, un second type d’intervention indétectable à l’œil nu car effectuée, elle aussi semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement : « un raccommodage à perte ». Cette technique consiste très précisément à insérer, entre les fils de trame et de chaîne, des fils (ici de coton) qui, à chaque fois, sont coupés à leurs deux extrémités sans faire de nœuds, les laissant ainsi littéralement se perdre dans le tissu de lin existant. Ces deux types spécifiques d’intervention (l’une dans le sens d’un remplacement de matière carbonée, l’autre dans celui à la fois d’un remplacement et d’un léger apport) permettraient de rendre compte de la grande dispersion des résultats observée (1238 1407) sur une si petite distance (à peine quatre centimètres de tissu). L’enduit de gomme arabique étant soluble dans l’eau et présent dans cette zone du coin supérieur gauche, il ne pouvait avoir été appliqué sur les fils superficiels des échantillons Raës et C14 qu’après l’incendie de la Sainte Chapelle de Chambéry de 1532. La teinture l’eût elle été avant, celle ci n’aurait pas dissimulé l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole dentelée car l’eau de l’incendie eût entraîné les produits de la pyrolyse locale au cœur des fils. Ce revêtement coloré ajouté tardivement explique l’absence de fluorescence aux UV observée dans cette aire particulière du drap. L’histoire de la conservation du Linceul après 1532 permet donc de dater, d’une manière très précise, au moins une sinon les deux interventions. Seules, en effet, les quatre sœurs clarisses, en 1534, et la princesse Clothilde de Savoie Bonaparte, en 1863/8, qui intervinrent de façon étendue sur la relique, auraient pu effectuer ce type de réparations invisibles de mains aussi expertes. Les sœurs clarisses s’étant vues confiée la tache bien spécifique de réparer et de consolider la pièce d’étoffe endommagée lors de l’incendie de 1532, la princesse de Savoie Bonaparte s’avère donc être, pour ces travaux délicats de restauration, la candidate la plus hautement probable (aidée ou non en cela du maître tapissier de la cour royale d’alors). Ce d’autant qu’en 1863, cela faisait déjà plus de cinq siècles qu’à chaque ostension à mains nues, la relique se retrouvait être tendue à l’horizontale. Tout ceci explique (ou expliquerait) pourquoi, lors de la découpe de l’échantillon et faute d’un éclairage adéquat (en lumière UV ou rasante), ces deux variantes locales passèrent totalement inaperçues aux yeux des experts textiles chargés de superviser le prélèvement pour la datation officielle de 1988. Toute leur attention était alors absorbée soit par l’étude technique du drap (qu’ils voyaient pour la toute première fois) soit par la présence gênante des fils de la couture épaisse qui liaient un résidu de la partie supérieure du Linceul au tissu à découper. Ainsi en oublièrent ils de procéder à un examen minutieux du cœur même du site textile à prélever. L’eurent ils examiné, ils n’auraient pu manquer, en effet, d’y repérer la petite reconstruction de forme serpentine, la teinture dissimulant l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole d’eau dentelée ainsi que le caractère plus raide et plus sombre de la zone. En principe, une restauration « invisible » ne saurait échapper au compte fil et a fortiori à la binoculaire lorsque l’œil derrière est compétent. Les photos qui montrent les Prs Francesco Testoré et Gabriel Vial († 2005) s’affairant avec divers instruments sont, cependant, on ne peu plus trompeuses en ce qu’elles laissent croire que lesdits experts étaient occupés à des vérifications préliminaires de l’intégrité de ladite zone quand, de fait, leurs vérifications ne furent pas étendues au cœur de l’échantillon mais se bornèrent à la seule lisière du drap. Ainsi croyant avoir libéré l’échantillon aux bords effilochés de tout fil étranger, laissèrent ils à l’opérateur, Giovanni Riggi di Numana († 2008), « le soin » de réduire à une bande rectangulaire un peu plus régulière le rectangle grossier que celui ci, à l’aide de ciseaux de chirurgien, venait d’extraire sans gants protecteurs et plus ou moins malhabilement à la pièce principale. De toute évidence, ce technicien (à qui échut la responsabilité et du choix de l’emplacement et de la prise d’échantillon !) n’était pas expert textile pas plus qu’il n’était carbonologue ou bien archéologue15. Il semblait en effet ignorer à quel point, en matière de radiodatation, la haute technologie de l’Accélérateur Spectromètre de Masse (adaptée pour les mesures sur des microéchantillons) s’avère être sensible aux contaminations y compris à celle du sébum humain. Ce choix d’une zone qui avait fait l’objet, au cours des siècles, de nombreuses manipulations à mains nues lors des ostensions, était donc déjà, de ce seul point de vue, tout sauf judicieux.” Re Mme Metchild Flury Lemberg’s opinion, I commented in a note: ” 10. – Lorsque l’on sait que de petites reconstructions invisibles à l’œil nu et à la lumière naturelle du jour pouvaient se trouver très circonscrites au cœur même du site de l’échantillon carbone 14 daté, on est pour le moins étonné qu’une experte textile de la valeur de Mme Metchild Flury Lemberg, sans même avoir jamais examiné de visu ledit cœur de l’échantillon in situ textilis ni avoir pris connaissance de la photographie précise et contrastée d’Enrié, puisse affirmer sans ambages que la texture dudit échantillon était uniforme et intacte. Partant du principe qu’un expert textile se devait d’être très attentif à l’origine (et à la représentativité) des fils qu’il observe, de toute évidence, il demeure difficile pour Mme Metchild Flury Lemberg d’accepter un seul instant l’idée que des confrères aient pu, juste avant la découpe de l’échantillon brut, ne pas procéder, à l’aide de loupes, compte fils et binoculaires, à l’examen des fils de chaîne et de trame au cœur même du site de prélèvement.”.","date":"2014-08-09","mins":"11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"},{"id":"comment-15358","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Actually in “the Gospel of Mark” the Aramaic is Peter’s not Mark’s….","date":"2012-08-22","mins":"10:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/21/another-review-of-thomas-de-wesselows-the-sign/","cat":"books","title":"Another Review of Thomas de Wesselow’s “The Sign”"},{"id":"comment-36575","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"John, bear in mind the potential limitations of Occam’s razor in many fields of expertise, please.

They are dried fluid images punctually resulting from some more significant yet partial pressure of smaller shrouds that were tightly closing the top of the long inner winding sheet. This is pretty obvious ONLY when the said areas are observed in transmtted light or from photograph taken in transmitted light (see 1988 Riggi photographs).

This amino acid is present in animal proteins including blood proteins or collagen.” Whence CB “[…]think[s] [he] now know[s] why STURP chemist Raymond Rogers detected hydroxyproline in the blood on the Shroud – and it’s to do with […] medicinal leeches…” In response to Colin Berry’s post I wrote: “CB, for once I will tend to agree with you: there is “[…] human blood […] accompanied by [an] animal derived product[]“.
