First the deceased’s eyes were closed or covered. Solely the long inner burial sindon (Heb. Sovev) was moistened with alkaline waters. Then it was tautly wrapped lengthwise around the stiff rigid body while the legs and torso were tightly wrapped up widthwise with two long linen strips and/or a shawl (Heb. Thalith) and the head tightly wrapped up (on top of the sovev) with a veil and a skullcap to both honour the deceased and counteract the head rigor mortis and keep the mouth shut (three wooden pieces were used to make a “small jaw box ” in conjunction with the two burial head dresses) During the image formation process, the sovev didn’t quite return to its natural size and shape as it got sort of taut again lengthwise through shrinking. The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from adduction to abduction thus creating sort of a counter pressure to wrapping up pressure. This resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint. The ritual fumigation allowed the latent body imprint to be revealed onto the long inner ancient burial cloth..","date":"2012-09-11","mins":"7:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/a-different-approach-to-what-some-see-as-problems-with-the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A different approach to what some see as problems with the image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-16140","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Mistyping: sorry I misposted my reply.","date":"2012-09-11","mins":"7:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/a-different-approach-to-what-some-see-as-problems-with-the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A different approach to what some see as problems with the image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-16161","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typing errors: “The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from a Bduction to a Dduction thus creating sort of a counter pressure to wrapping up pressure.

On the individual sick with various diseases that do not interest here, the hydroxyproline increases in the blood serum and urine. Did they guess situations in which increases substantially the hydroxyproline in serum and urine? The hydroxyproline increases very significantly in blood serum and urine in deep stretch muscle kept, what is well known for the sports medicine. I think not a stretch muscle maintained more intense than the one provided for 3 hours of CRUCIFIXION.

Re the latter remark: most likely, lateral presence of solid objects (fresh medical plants, small “jaw box” etc) + lateral body to cloth ‘bridges’ could account for no serious lateral distortion (panoramicity) since there was no lateral body to cloth direct contact (hence no lateral images). Re Jackson’s reconstruction, shall I remind you of his most striking errors that show how amateurish his alleged ‘reconstruction’ is: – the Turin Shroud blood image and body image imply at least TWO (slightly) different configurations of the long burial cloth in close conjunction with the corpse, not just one from beginning to end as far as the bloody body formation process is concerned. – the side strip mistakingly is left on the Shroud for this demonstration.

The fact is I DID study Technical Drawing for two years (in high school) in France + soft and hard stone carving/sculpting for one year at the CFC des Compagnons du Tour de France, Nantes, France. I DO know ‘the way that the projection would work’! I can think in 3 D, thank you. I can even think in 4 D (+ archaeological TIME), in 5 D (+ MATTER in terms of 3:1 twill linen return force) and 6 D (+ archaeological thermal source(s) of ENERGY)… Besides I attempted twice to reconstruct as accurately as possible the TS man’s “wrapping in shrouds” in 1994 and 1997 (I even got two sets of photographs). If much further experimental work is something that is sadly lacking, in ALL of the various theories of image formation, shall I endlessly repeat my research work is still in progress. I STILL need a full body silicone medical mannequin realistic replica of the Sindon Man with water chamber (to be filled with heated water to simulate body and body hyperthermia temperatures) and fully jointed neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles (to provide a deathlike range of similar rigor mortis positions) + 3 4 sets of ad hoc linen cloths (both medieval and late antique replicas) so that I could reconstruct the Sindon’s Man specific burial in state of the art experimental archaeology. This is not as easy as just looking up the Encyc. Brit. To get the answer (as you most wrongly think an old idle All Black man on pension named Dave Belz, Wellington, NZ). Mr all black belz, have you ever attempted to reconstruct the TS man’s wrapping in shrouds to be so assertive and so critic of my research work? Most obviously you haven’t. Had you, you should have been aware the image formation process is NO mere 3 D geometry problem. G.od forgive the all black old idle man to be so discorteously arrognorant! Methinks, Mr Belz Dave should do his homework in complex variable projective geometry as far as the bloody body image formation process is concerned! A MATTER OF “COMPLEX VARIABLE PROJECTIVE GEOMETY” Re distortions: The Sindon image is affected by several distortions strongly suggestive of rigor mortis such as head slightly bent forward, back curved and legs bent with raised knees. The unusually long arms and seemingly long fingers on the right hand imply both dislocation and uneven stretching at the arm level. The latter distortions are a matter of “complex variable projective geometry” as the long inner burial cloth shrank up and got somehow taut again – during the Sindon image formation process – in conjunction with abducted adducted arms counteracted rigor mortis. During the image formation process, the tightly pulled sovev (long inner burial sheet) didn’t quite return to its natural size and shape as it got sort of taut again lengthwise through shrinking. The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from abduction to adduction thus creating sort of a counter pressure to wrapping up pressure. Through drying out and slight cloth to body pressure release, the arms mechanically tended to slightly raised again, this resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint. Addition to my #63 as reminder: A stiff rigid body does behave like a wooden board and the TS man’s corpse was all in freshly dried blood covered with dust, which explains the absence of any smearing on the cloth. The horizontal S fold (at the buttock level see Thierry Castex 3 D reconstruction) is an ease fold to help correctly handle/wrap the body placed in extra height to be subjected to a (myrrhic )aloetic fumigation thus creating sort of a tight protective seal (much akin to shrink wrap back and front) over the stiff rigid corpse after the canes are removed. Once the corpse is tightly wrapped up, the pair of canes tranversally inserted through the S fold at buttock level (in the bottom half of the long inner burial cloth) could also have helped carry the body down to the tomb chamber and place it on the tomb bench on granulized myrrh bags..","date":"2013-06-07","mins":"12:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-completely-inappropriate-experiment-nice-white-lab-coats-anyway/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A completely inappropriate experiment.

And that the epitaphios was influenced by the Shroud. I doubt the Shroud was in southern Germany in the the late 1200s, although it could have been.” And Charles replied: “Of course you are free to put forward your own theories, Thomas. And we all know cases where people, whether academics or not, stick to their theories even if there is no evidence to support them.” Now what about outstanding American Byzantine Art Historian, Dr. Ernst Kitzinger’s opinion in 1979: “The Shroud of Turin is unique in art. It doesn’t fall into any artistic category. For us, a very small group of experts around the world (German Byzantine Art Historian Hans Belting included), we believe the Shroud of Turin is the Shroud of Constantinople. You know that the crusaders took many treasures back to Europe during the 13th century, we believe that the shroud was one of them (Lavoie 2000: 73 – 74).”? Threnoi epitaphioi do show Shroud like characteristics as early as 1200 and 1300 CE. They are modeled on the famous relic. Can Charles account for the sudden emergence of the threnoi epitaphioi in the 1200s CE? He just cannot. Besides can he account for the dramatic change in the depiction of the two Archangels’LONG NARROW HERRINGBONE WEAVE PATTERNED loros (or stole) symbolic of Yeshua’s burial shroud (see late 13th CE Grandson antependium from a Cypriot workshop) when the Knights templar owned the entire island of Cyprus?

CE Salki/”Hidden” Church fresco depicts the Hoy Face of the Constantinople Sindon (now kept in Turin) in conjunction with the same Byzantine roundel motifs that are depicted on the entire garments/robes cloaks of individuals of secular significance (the elite), the Christian Militant Saints & Martyrs and Archangels. The seven red brick and white roundel motifs, as a symbol of the perfection and the unity, can be read at two different levels: 1/ no matter how sketchy it looks, in the particular grouping of the seven brick red coloured roundels, an 11th century CE Cappadocia shepherd could have easily recognized the seven star asterism seen as a Ladle (in the constellation of Ursa Major/the Great Bear). All the more so if you think they were featured both on the inside and outside of the two outer wings of a reliquary, when swung shut, the facial image was no longer intervening between the three stars – Alcor, Mizar, Alioth – in the tail forming the handle and the four stars – Pheeda, Megrez, Dubhe, Merak – at the head forming the scoop and the asterism geometry restored. Reminder: Zeus (the king of the gods) turned Callisto and her son Arcas into bears and put them in the sky to form two constellations: the Great Bear (Plough or Ladle) and the Little Bear. Both constellations are made of seven mains stars. In ancient times the name of the Great Bear constellation was Helike, (“turning”), because all northern hemisphere stars will of course be seen to rotate around Polaris but of course this will appear more manifest for the brighter asterisms at the north most declinations, such as Ursa Major. In the Sakli fresco, Yeshua is the Pole as an example to follow and a guide through the journey of life, from earth to heaven. As to the white roundel field, it is a symbolic motif of all the good deeds the truthful and faithful place as a treasure in heaven (see Yeshua’s teachings:”If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven (Matthew 19:21).” 2/ because there are two different kinds of wisdom: “Heavenly Wisdom (or Christian Wisdom) ‘vs.’ Earthly Wisdom (or Greek Wisdom)”, there are also two ways to read the constellation like shaped seven roundel motif: First reading: the three brick red roundels on the left (inside wing of a reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of Sophia (Greek for Wisdom) and her three holy daughters Pistis, Elpis, and Agape (Greek Faith, Hope and Charity) whereas the four three brick red roundels on the right (inside wing of the reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of the four “cardinal” virtues: dikaiosyne (Greek for justice), phronesis (Greek for prudence), sophrosyne (Greek for temperance), and andreia (Greek for courage). Second reading: the three brick red roundels on the left (inside wing of the reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Ghost) whereas the four three brick red roundels (on the right (inside wing of the reliquary?) are symbolic motifs of the four orthodox Christian cardinal virtues: agape (Greek for selfless love), eleos (Greek for mercy), thysia (Greek for sacrifice), and diakonia (Greek for service)..","date":"2014-11-18","mins":"9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/a-scorch-is-a-scorch-of-course-of-course/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A scorch is a scorch, of course, of course,"},{"id":"comment-203440","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Re post: Could now Colin Berry tell us how one can get the Turin Shroud double bloodied body imprint that is neat and tidy blood rivulet and bloodied wound decals along with ventral and dorsal negative permanent fuzzy and faint yet fairly translucent straw yellow coloured 3 D very superficial imprints of one’s subject?.","date":"2015-06-24","mins":"6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/a-shameless-plug/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Shameless Plug"},{"id":"comment-193682","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"..

To trigger up such an accidental/providential image formation process, it requires: 1/pre mordanting conditions (i.e. Burial linen cloth in soaked with aqueous alkaline solution such as ashes of the Red Heifer, Jerusalem limestone dust and/or ammonia present in urea residues mixed with pure living water/collected rainwater), could have been then subjected to a low temperature accidental/providential thermal imprinting process (e.g. Ritual fumigation and/or corpse hyperthermia) 2/auto collimation. The Maillard reaction, in of itself, is not sufficient to explain the (uniform) degree of resolution of the collimated TS image. Adhesion of water insoluble (e.g. Iron oxyde and/or other “opaques”/silica particles present in the desert of Judea dust) onto the blood covered body skin and/or receiving flax surface are most needed, which implies first a tightly wrapped up coth to body configuration (with relatevely few air gaps front and back) and then slight and gradual unsticking, back and front, of the long shroud used as inner shroud, through shrinking up. Reminder: the Sharaf (the biblical Ru Ha Qâdim or East Wind) is an Israel dust wind more commonly known as Khamsin or the Dark Breath of the desert of Judea.body covered with “opaques” present in the Judean desert and/or Jerusalem limestone/Melky stone dust 3/heating source such as corpse in hyperthermia and/or fumigation as a purifying and drying out ritual. Reminder 1: Dead kings’ cave tombs and corpse could be fumigated (see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum). Hence, in the hypothesis the Turin Shroud is Yeshu’a’s, the body could have been subjected to a specific purifying/drying out ancient Judean ritual in the shape of fumigation/burning aromatic woods/spices and at least one incense pan to hold burning charcoal could have been used. Most likely the body image only affected a superficial thin layer of impurities made of starch, lignin, pectin, saponin, hemicellulose deposits and/or flax wax. Note: in case no aloetic myrrhic particles could be found neither on the surface nor in the threads, that could mean the shroud was not in direct contact with the fumigation but shorter outer shrouds AND/OR a longer outer shroud also wrapped up the corpse and acted as a screen 4/ low temperature alkali gelatinisation of starch residuals present in ancient linen cloth is also a possible factor as printing paste to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process. Now Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with water can gelatinize starch at 55° 85°C and act as as a extremely fine printing paste. 5/ in soaked 3:1 twill weave linen mechanical return force. Most likely the in soaked long inner cloth burial shroud was first tautly wrapped lengthwise and then compressed widthwise around body with dry outer shrouds and then slightly unstuck back and front through drying out and got sort of taut again lenghtwise while still compressed widthwise (by the second layer and/or third layer of dry shorter outer shrouds AND/OR a longer outer shroud) and shrinking up” “Naturally pre mordanted linen once naturally mordanted, the mordanting looks like a very light scorch or ‘pre scorch’.” Absent Yeshua’s return to life/resurrection that could account for his inner cloth burial shroud having been kept as a memorial of his dramatic event and the relic being not deteriorated (prior to the 1532 Chambery Sainte Chapelle fire), this reaction I theorize could have been relatively or even totally unsusual to Second Temple inner cloth burial shroudss ince Yeshua’s shed innocent blood had to be purified (via the ashes of the Red Heifer combined with spring water or just Jerusalem limestone dust?) since it could not be avenged (all the members of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin that sentenced him to deah just could not be killed all the more so as Yeshua’s taught his disciples to love his/their enemies). Besides as a victim of a violent death, his body should be buried with his shed innocent blood.” “I went as far as thought experiment allowed me to go. Methinks the image formation process aka pre or light mordanting, can be replicated. Methinks alkali water solution vapor/fumigation in conjunction with linen textile substrate can reveal bodyprint all right (in the no air gaps areas in conjunction with the first cloth to body inner shroud configuration) On May 22, 2013 at 9:20 am, I also wrote as notes: “During the whole image formation process, the TS man’s stiff rigid corpse could have been first wrapped up and then laid out in extra height (first on its left side and then right side) on two raised stones to be subjected to a ritual myrrhic aloetic fumigation/drying ritual in the antechamber. Reminder: this implies the presence of 5 6 buriers. Also note: A resin such as that of the fragrant myrrh has always been associated with fumigation and purification rituals. As a ‘funeral’ herb, myrrh is said to ease grief and heal emotional wounds, bringing peace and calm. Besides it has anti microbial properties. When burned with moistening rotten aloe wood chips (moistening helps produce more smoke), some carbon monoxide is liberated along with smoke. On January 29, 2015 at 8:07 and 8:41am and on March 16, 2013 at 11:40 a.m. (#5 Reply) and 7:35 p.m. (#21 Reply), I wrote: “(Now) blood intensifiers (such as pre or light mordanting, carbon monoxide liberated along with smoke in the course of a Judean ritual in the shape of fumigation/burning aromatic aloetic woods/myrrh etc) could account for the aged/archaeological blood colour changing (upon exposure to bright sunlight or UV exposure) from standard old brownish to bright carmin rose via brownish mauve.” “In terms of ancient bloodstain pattern analysis, the TS crucifixion victim haematic cartography is flawless. It strongly suggests a cloth in soaked/moistened with aqueous alkaline solution, remoistened freshly dried blood and both a cloth to body very close contact and gradual loss of contact 2 D to 3 D image resulting from a collimated/auto regulated light (or pre )mordanting (of a thin carbohydrate and/or dust, dirt and body fluid layer of impurities). Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking gradual unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner body sheet soaked in a watery solution was compressed widthwise (with smaller dry clean outer shrouds + large all envelopping burial cloth– now kept in Kornelimïnster and known as sudarium domini = the Johnian soudarion) while taut lengthwise back and front as all parts of the body should be wrapped up (see Naḥmanides, Torat ha Adam; Inyan ha hoẓa’ah) and then the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse, lying in extra height first on one side and then the other side, was subjected to fumigation (in the proscess the long inner body sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up).” “Natural mordanting of dry blood remoistened with aqueous alkaline solution along with drying through myrrhic aloetic (wood aloe) fumigation could account for: – The aged bloodstains still “looking fresh” today when seen in full day on the long inner burial cloth as if the blood had just been shed the day before. Mordant is known to be used for INTENSIFYING STAINS e.g. In cell or tissue preparations – Potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now it is well known gelatine is a breakdown product of collagen. The true fact is low temperature (55° 85° C) alkali gelatinisation of starch residuals present in the ancient linen cloth could be a possible factor as bubbling very fine printing paste to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process. – Bilirubin being neither the problem nor the solution, just probably one part of the whole equation as it could have been trapped (along with carbon monoxide?) during the image formation process. – Most likely dust, dirt and body fluids should be found in the very impurity layer that makes up the body image and the neat haematic cartography results from a sticking gradual unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner body sheet soaked in a watery solution was compressed widthwise (with smaller dry clean outer shrouds + large all envelopping burial cloth– now kept in Kornelimïnster and known as sudarium domini = the Johnian soudarion) while taut lengthwise back and front as all parts of the body should be wrapped up (see Naḥmanides, Torat ha Adam; Inyan ha hoẓa’ah) and then the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse, lying in extra height first on one side and then the other side, was subjected to fumigation (in the proscess the long inner body sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up).” And on June 4, 2013 at 8:00 am (#63 Reply), I also wrote: “The presence of oozing from the wounds + the very fact the buriers took great care not to disturb the blood is consistent with an ancient Judean/Jewish burial custom in terms of bloody corpse tahara (purification ritual). It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. Aged/archaeological human blood is definitely not human fresh blood. The former could have been degraded through a specific burial ritual, which both shroudies and anti shroudies seem to totally overlook.” “My thesis neither include nor preclude the TSM’s resurrection or coming back to life.”.","date":"2015-03-05","mins":"10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/checking-in-on-colin-berry-a-new-image-model-forming-in-my-mind/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Checking In On Colin Berry:  A New Image Model  ‘forming in my mind’"},{"id":"comment-192397","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"CB wrote: “Science, real science that is, should be curiosity – not agenda driven”.

Could You remember and tell me if Swiss criminologist Dr Max Frei lifted pollen grains with his sticky tapes BEFORE or AFTER You and Vernon Miller took pictures of the Shroud Face? Or else was it IN BETWEEN? I do suspect him to have partially fragmented or damaged the already faint and incomplete blood decals on the right eye area by his too vigorous pressure of a sticky tape on the linen cloth in 1978.” Here was Barrie’s reply: “As for your final and most important question, Max Frei did NOT take ANY sticky tape samples from the face! He was about to do so when John Jackson stopped him. Rogers also did not take tape samples from the face. There is no way sticky tape samples could have impacted the supposed coin images. That is a fact.” IF THIS IS A FACT, how come then Avinoam Danim did study at least one stycky tape lifted up by Max Frei from the Shroud Face in 1978? Could Barrie explain it? ” MORE THAN A YEAR LATER, I AM STILL WAITING FOR BARRY’S CLEARING IT UP… The very fact Barry “now” certified “[he] documented every minute of Max [Frei]’s tape sampling experiment photographically and [he] can assure [Dave] that neither he nor Rogers took any tape samples from the face” ONLY ADD UP TO THE GENERAL CONFUSION (with Lucotte’s mentionning a second sticky tape pulled up from the facial area!).

A good example of a possible biological explanation would be to assume that, for some reason (more urea deposit over the eyes than around the eyes?), there has been a higher release of ammoniac gases in this particular region of the eyes versus the peripheral region, which would have caused a more important density of coloration on the surface of the cloth in this particular area. Another rational explanation could come from the fact that the eyes of the Shroud man were very swollen and because of that, they were closer to the fabric than normal, which lead to a more important coloration because of this high proximity (probably a direct contact). ” Who’s really getting too far? The French Canadian YC! Bucklin did examine both 3 D AND 2 D. Can YC tell us how really can an eminent professional forensic pathologist like Buklin, mistake “swollen eyes” images for (somehow) rounded protrusions?

This frontal only shroud copy of 1377 CE was singled out in the official account of those events in 1794 C Eas having been torn into bandages.” If the Lirey Shroud was thought to be a cunning copy of the Shroud of Christ, most likely the Besançon Shroud was a clumsy frontal only shroud painted copy and a pale/non embroidered copy of Byzantine Greek threnoi epitaphioi..","date":"2015-05-11","mins":"6:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/09/colin-berry-has-it-all-figured-out-sort-of-maybe/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Has It All Figured Out, Sort Of, Maybe"},{"id":"comment-198854","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh wrote: “There is no suggestion whatever in the d’Arcis memorandum that the Bishop thought there was actually a shroud from which the Lirey one was copied.” Oh, really?

Pierre d’Arcy discarded the Lirey Shroud as such since he thought there was no figure on the Shroud of Christ and therefore could only be a fraudulent… COPY/REPRODUCTION! Methinks Hugh you got it all wrong and have a real knack to mispresent other’s opinion (mine, Pierre d’Arcy and Wölfli etc) Once you wrote re Wölfli having problems dating his mother in law’s linen tablecloth (see link at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n20part4.pdf): “A modern tablecloth would probably date at BP200 or more, which on calibration would indicate a number of dates between about 1670 and the present day.

Indeed Dr Wolfli was NOT joking AT ALL.” On April 21, 2015 at 9:08 am you replied: “How do you know that? Anyway, in that case, he perhaps was not aware that all modern artefacts date as well to the 17th century as they do to the 21st. The accuracy of any C 14 date depends on the slope of the calibration graph, which, averaged out over the last three or four hundred years, is more or less flat. Everybody’s mother in law’s tablecloths will date as well to then as they do to now.” On April 21, 2015 at 10:22 am, I replied: “See Ian Wilson’s review of David Sox’s The Shroud Unmasked: Uncovering the Greatest Forgery of all Time, Lamp Press paperback. On p. 138 Sox notes: “Wölfli of Zurich was WORRIED (upper cases mine; NOT JOKING) about the results he had with the linen tablecloth of his wife’s mother. It was 50 years old, but carbon dating said it was 350 years old. There might have been A PROBLEM CREATED BY DETERGENT (upper cases mine) which had been used on the cloth.” On April 21, 2015 at 9:57 am, Louis commented Re: Dr.Wolfli It is evident that Ian Wilson didn’t take it as a joke.If he had, there would be no mention in the review. Dr. Wolfli is recorded elsewhere expressing doubts about the Shroud’s radiocarbon dating. On April 21, 2015 at 10:50 and 10:52 am and on April 22, 2015 at 5:14am, I myself commented: “Actually, it was Sox first who didn’t take it as a joke and then Wilson didn’t either. Most criously, ONLY Hugh takes it as a joke! It does seem actually Wölfli feared the TS could be dated 9th or 10th centrury CE (that is 300 years older than expected) because of the presence of detergent.

Could you tell me when exactly ALL KINDS of substantial detergent residue could be first removed once and for all? Had you read radiocarbon literature, you should have been aware “Detergents can resist removal due to their hydrophobic attractions with proteins. Incomplete rinsing can leave a substantial detergent residue that may skew the F14 C value.” Can you refer me to any scientific paper backing up your opinion (there is “NO EVIDENCE” at all modern AND ancient detergent have a signficant effect as a contaminant on modern AND ancient linens? Actually, you just cannot. Period. BTW re natural soap and detergent, have you ever studied the impact of remoistened substantial human urea residue mixed with ashes and water on a linen cloth that was fumigated (aloetic fumigation) as far as radiocarbon dating is concerned? Most obviously you haven’t. Reminder: when it comes to radiocarbon date very old textiles, oddly in only 60 70% cases carbonometry is accurate chronometry. It is not 100%. You also wrote: “Both Victor Saxer and Bruno Bonnet Eymard make clear that their use of the term ‘reproduce’ does not refer to a copy of a painting, as you would know if you read their accounts in full rather than snatching at snippets.” I read both Victor Saxer’s and Boonet Eymard’s. Methinks you just skipped twice the word “une copie” in VS ‘s paper on p. 31 and in BBE’s on p15 16 the words “reproduit” (two occurrences), reproduire (one occurrence) and reproductions (two occurrences). BBE states “les reproductions de reliques étaient d’usages courant à l’époque (…) elles étaient considérées comme nos modernes reproductions photographiques” in other words “reproductions” here within a medieval context is synonym of “more or less faithful copies/reproductions”. This is no misrepresentation at all! Most obviously you cannot correctly read French (BTW I did read their whole paper each time and more than once and both are written in French NOT in English just in case who had missed it!). Etymologically speaking, copia/”copy” is the most fitted vocable to describe the Lirey Shroud aka the TS as a most impressive/creative/genial rendering of the true burial of Shroud of Christ.

Not to mention pre washing out of the blood (through wearing a woollen tunic in conjunction with heavy sweating on his way to the cross + a pre burial linen napkin or sudarium placed over his head to soak up and keep his blood oozing from his nose and mouth on the cross and on the way to the tomb) nor the Gospel accounts of Yeshua’s burial (in terms of winding, compressing and fastening his body in shrouds), my theory can account for what precisely other theories have totally failed to do so far namely: – body imprint/image superficiality and blood appearing too reddish in terms of light or pre mordant joining with the linen fibers and the gelatinized starch (as ultra fine printing paste/medium) to set the straw yellow colour (as thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that makes up the body image) permanently and along with the freshly dried blood (remoistened with aqueous alkaline solution) to set the carmin red colour through myrrhic woodaloetic fumigation/burning and exposure to carbon monoxide liberated along with smoke in the course of a specific Judean ritual. Reminders: (light) mordant is known to be used for intensifying stains e.g. In cell or tissue preparations. Low temperature (55° 85° C) alkali gelatinisation of residual starch present in the ancient linen cloth could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal.

It begins by defining the coin on eye issue and determining the real problem. In a preliminary approach to evaluate the quality of both arch sceptics and arch advocates’ main opinions and reasoning, it demonstrates the need to apply to the suspected eye areas, the strict methodology of an eidomatico numismatic reading grid based on the bloodstain pattern analytical technique. It then proceeds to a full reappraisal of possible coin impressions left on the said areas. Finally, in the light of the new observations and findings, it considers the necessity to integrate the new data within a more coherent archaeological framework. Through mere repetition from one author to the other and via a couple of successful websites, many an interpretation, biased result, received idea, pseudo theory and half truth have become quasi facts and even at times quasi dogmas in Shroud literature of all persuasions. In connection with the famous linen cloth, the coin on eye issue is no exception to this general state of things. For over three decades, arch advocates adamantly have been thinking they see coin images on the eye areas while arch sceptics, just as adamantly, have been thinking they do not. Even among “pro coin on eye” researchers, interpretative discrepancies are observed for each eye area. As an archaeocryptologist i.e. As an ancient enigmatic image, inscription and artefact analyst and cryptanalyst, the issue did pique my curiosity. Are the coin images just mere “figures in clouds” or are they real? Could the problem objectively be ever solved? In this light, both proponents and opponents must be reminded that there may be a very fine line between “I think I see coin images” and “I think I don’t see coin images”, depending on five crucial parameters: first and foremost, quality of material (is it biased or unbiased?); secondly conditions for observations (are the tools and technique appropriate?); thirdly observer’s particular field or fields of expertise (is s/he the right or the wrong expert/is s/he speaking inside or outside her/his own field or fields of expertise?); fourthly and fifthly observer’s personal approach and vulnerability (is s/he making use or non use of inductive reasoning/is s/he the victim of intersubjectivity, unconscious and/or ideological biases in the recording, analysis and/or cryptanalysis of data?). In order to get out of the research dead end, I think it is essential now to go beyond the “pro and anti coin on eye” dichotomy. One must be fully aware that those who claim the ability to identify the presence or the absence of coin impressions left on the Shroud (a theologian, a psychiatrist, a medical doctor, an amateur scholar of numismatics or coin collector, a technical photographer, a church historian, a mathematician, a linguist, a lawyer, a laser physicist or engineer for instance) are definitely not the best qualified Shroud researchers to analyze and/or cryptanalyze ancient images and inscriptions. How can anyone of them turn into a professional numismatist, an archaeological analyst or cryptanalyst overnight? It does take extensive data analysis and/or cryptanalysis before you acquire the proper eye and brain. Without such a trained eye and brain for forms, how can a non specialist, credibly discriminate between misspelling, misreading and non univocal forms; between mere “figures in clouds” and genuine palaeographic information embedded in visual background noise and random shapes? From an archaeocryptologist’s perspective, the present paper aims therefore at making a full reappraisal of intriguing patterns on the eye areas in an attempt to surface more real facts and reach an illuminating synthesis no matter which side of the Shroud authenticity the coin on eye issue may fall..","date":"2011-10-22","mins":"9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/19/comment-promoted-of-coins-and-flowers-and-more-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted: Of Coins and Flowers and More on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4253","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"I am 100% with you Ron..","date":"2011-10-22","mins":"10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/19/comment-promoted-of-coins-and-flowers-and-more-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted: Of Coins and Flowers and More on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-4262","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Yannick, you seem to think and write as if you had attended Yeshoua’s burial two thousand years ago.

Ask any forensic image analyst, glyptographist, paleographer or archaeologist worth his salt, he will confirm you the use of such ‘a revealing technique’ to help him to read inscription or imprint. Secondly THE SAME intriguing minute patterns DOES ALSO show (though a little less constrasted) on BOTH 1978 Miller’s and 2002 Durante’s Shroud photographs (I still have to check Hal 2008 Shroud eye area photographs). The FACT is no less than THREE different photographic procedures (orthochomatic, traditional silver and digital) and a very close eidomatic numismatic reading grid based on the the blood pattern analysis, do confirm the presence of partial Pilate coin patterns on both eyes each time. There “those who think they see” what is not really there (and are all too prone to be the victim of pareidoliae, semi pareidoliae in terms of misreading namely Filas et al) AND “those who think they don’t see” what is really there (and are all too prone to judge it is just “crazy stuff” namely Dan, Schwortz etc).

(Contre enquête sur un fiasco scientifique et archéologique) Par Max Patrick HAMON Résumé En 1988 et en contradiction avec les conclusions de près de cent ans de recherches multidisciplinaires, le Linceul de Turin fut déclaré d’origine médiévale par le Dr Michaël Tite, coordinateur des trois laboratoires universitaires de datation radiocarbone d’Oxford, de Zurich et de Tucson (Arizona) chargés conjointement de dater un échantillon de tissu prélevé sur la relique. À en croire le Pr Évin, porte parole officiel de l’expérience, ce résultat, était incontestable. Pourtant, vingt années de contre expertises plus tard, un noyau irréductible de faits avérés contribuent à accréditer très fortement la thèse selon laquelle, lors d’une petite restauration invisible (voire même de deux) effectuée(s) au XI Xe siècle, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement, du matériel textile étranger de remplacement beaucoup plus récent avait été habilement entremêlé aux fils de lin originels dans le coin supérieur gauche du Linceul d’où avait été extrait l’échantillon. Cette matière carbonée, issue d’activités humaines postérieures à la formation du lin, ne fut ni détectée ni éliminée que ce soit par les deux experts textiles responsables du prélèvement ou bien par les trois laboratoires qui procédèrent à la mesure de la teneur carbone 14 résiduelle de l’échantillon officiel.

On “February 16 17, 2013, I wrote: CLOTH TO CORPSE ARCHAEOLOGICAL HYDROTHERMOCHEMICAL IMPRINTING “Reminder for Colin Berry et al: Archaeo(crypto)logically speaking, in the most likely hypothesis the TSM is Yeshua’s, a natural cloth to corpse thermal imprinting should account in turn for a high resolution superficial body image, undisturbed bloodstains and a two thousand years’ old degraded blood still looking fresh on the cloth. To trigger up such an accidental/providential image formation process, it requires: 1/pre mordanting conditions (i.e. Burial linen cloth in soaked with aqueous alkaline solution such as the Red Heifer waters and/or Jerusalem limestone/Malky dust mixed with waters + ammonia present in urea residues) 2/auto collimation (body covered with “opaques”/sand grains present in the Judean desert and that most likely covered the TSM’s corpse) and/or Jerusalem limestone/Malky dust (to account for both the soft focus effect and stochastic aspect of the Shroud image) + long inner burial linen cloth first tautly wrapped lengthwise and then compressed widthwise around body (with stretching and excessive compression at head level to explain the reverse side incomplete pressure imprint) + next to skin to cloth contact followed by gradual loss of next to skin to cloth contact through burial inner sheet shrinkage and relative loosening as it gets sort of taut again front and back and gradually unstuck from deceased’s body the latter resting in extra height and being laid out first on its left side and then right side while drying out 3/heating source such as corpse in hyperthermia and/or fumigation as a purifying and drying out ritual. Low temperature alkali gelatinisation of starch residuals present in ancient linen cloth is also a possible factor as printing paste to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process. Purifying aqueous alkaline solution (e.g. Red Heifer ashes and/or Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with water) bubble and gelatinise at low temperature (55° 85° Celsius) and thus can be used in turn as imprinting paste thin film, mordanting and pre washing agent).

The true fact is a loosely draped body actually is totally inconsistent with the Greek verbs used in the Gospel to describe Yeshua’s body wrapping in shrouds: entulisso, “to wrap, encircle”; eneileo, “to compress, tightly wrap up” and deo, “to fasten, bind”. As wrapping in shrouds was/is one of the Judean/Jewish burial core procedures, in order to counteract arms forced in rigor mortis from adduction to abduction, a crucifixion victim’s bloody body fastening/binding + compressing/tightly wrapping up were most needed. The true fact is the TS bloodstain cartography implies a tightly wrapped up cloth to body front and back configuration. During the bloody body image formation process (as the cloth got somewhat taut again via shrinking and resulted in a new configuration), the arm counteracted rigor mortis was recorded in terms of image distortion (right hand with elongated ‘bony’ fingers + unequal abducted arm length)..","date":"2013-06-23","mins":"3:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/23/paper-chase-computerized-anthropometric-analysis-of-the-image/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase:  Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Image"},{"id":"comment-37916","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Correction: Matthias, don’t you mistake a 2h 2h30′s speedy burial for a 30 minutes’ hasty one, PLEASE!

Nothing. He just cannot care less and still claim the body was just draped over… beside he cannot read koine Greek. What does he make of the fact it is written Yeshua was buried according to the JUDEAN burial custom? Nothing again. He just cannot care less. The burial time frame between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath is 4 hours. No problem, he keeps claiming Yeshua’s burial was dispatched in less than half an hour.

Such a view (or should I better say “preaching”) presupposes: 1/Yossef Ha Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), waited until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him. Are you serious? Do you really think Yossef Ha Ramatayim would have also run the risk not to abide by Deuteronomy 21: 22 23 and wait to the very last minute for taking down himself or having Rabbi Yeshua’s body be taken down from the cross and buried? It does seem you totally overlook “one little circumstantial fact”: in the Second Temple period, any working activity was to stop at midday “on preparation day” that is on the very eve of the great Shabbat of Pessa H/Passover (Pessa H 4, V). How then could possibly Joseph of Aramathia have bought a shroud after sunset and before dusk on that specific day when Jerusalem weavers’ workshops, stores and shops had all been closed for more than 6 6½ hours? This is a total exegetical non sense. Unless one is ignorant of the ethnic milieu and thinks a Judean of the Second Temple period would have waited until sunset on “preparation day” and go and buy a shroud long after all the weaver’s workshops and linen shops had closed, this reconstruction of the event chronology is most unlikely. In all likelihood, Yossef Ha Ramathaym had already bought a fine linen shroud for himself in anticipation of his own death and used it to wrap Yeshua’s body “with his shed innocent blood”. As a disciple of Yeshua, didn’t Yossef go as far as using his own recently hewn garden tomb near by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus to both abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to his burial? [Precision: the women bought the spices not just BEFORE but just AFTER the sabbatical rest. Mark (16: 1) raises the ambiguity which could result from the chronologically biased relation/presentation of the same fact in Luke (23: 56).] 2/ Modern time markers such as ‘evening’, ‘sunset’, ‘twilight dusk’ philologically cover the same realities for a Judean of the Second Temple period. Far from it! With respect to the time frame for Yeshua’s burial, here are the ancient biblical Hebrew words & expressions for the time markers from noon to night used in the Second Temple period yet currently overlooked by Shroud researchers/old students and exegetes: 1/Tsot ha yom (or “midday”) refers to that time of the day at equal distance between sunset and sunrise. 2/Tsohorayim (dual form of Tsohar, “dazzling light” or “zenith”) literally means “two dazzling lights” or “two zeniths” and refers to ‘both morning and evening lights’ merging into ‘noon’. 3/Erev (“evening”) may indifferently refer to the 1st or the 2nd evening. Rabbi Yeshua died exactly between the first and the second evening (at the 9th hour). 4/Beyn ha arbayim literally means “between the two evenings,” — arbayim being the dual form of erev, “evening.” The afternoon was divided into two halves: from noon to mid afternoon and from mid afternoon to sunset or put in other words from early to late evening (See Exodus 29:38 41, “They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha arbayim”). For the covenant people, the entire day revolved around the offering of the two Tamid lambs: that of the morning and that of the evening. “In a paper entitled « En Vue de la Solution Archéologique de l’Énigme » I presented in Turin in 1998, I wrote: « Le deuxième sacrifice quotidien du Temple (Numbers 28: 4 8) dit sacrifice du “soir” (evening sacrifice) se déroulait vers le milieu de l’après midi (mid afternoon) et pouvait être avancé d’une heure (une veille de Pâque) voire même de deux heures (lorsque cette grande fête tombait un Shabbat) (Pessa H 5:1). Le premier sacrifice avait lieu le matin. Ainsi “le premier soir” allait il du milieu du jour (from midday) jusqu’à la deuxième immolation en milieu d’après midi (until mid afternoon) et, « le deuxième soir », de la deuxième immolation du milieu d’après midi (from mid afternoon) jusqu’au crépuscule du soir (until twilight/dusk)».”. 5/Shqiya, “sunset”; the sun set at 18:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and 18:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. 6/Beyn ha shemashot which literally means “between the suns” is an expression for “dusk” or “twilight” between the setting sun and the rising moon (which reflects the light of the sun). 7/Layla, “night”; typically layla is taken to be when you can see three stars in the sky in reference to tset ha kokhavim, the first “three stars coming out” to announce a new day (here the great Shabbat of Pessa H). The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and19:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. Owing to a lunar eclipse or the Ruah Qadīm, “east wind” (Khamsin/Sharav); a wind blowing from the desert of Judea, the whole city of Jerusalem was plunged into darkness from tsohorayim (“noon”) to beyn ha arbayim (“between the two evenings” that is the 9th hour of the day; 15.34 p.m. On April 7 30 CE/ 15.04 p.m. On April 3 33 CE). In other words, for 3h34/3h04, on the very day Rabbi Yeshua died on the cross, it was also night, “layla” on that very day in the eye of a Judean of the Second Temple period. Hence, the actual maximum time frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. Within a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s buriers had enough time to pre wash his body (i.e. To re dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. Sindôn/Heb. Sadin) soaked with a watery solution (ashes of the Red Heifer?) and tightly wrap it up, with fresh aromatic medical insect repellent plants, in linen clothes and strips. In the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three days immediately following his burial. Anointment was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite as it allowed preventing bad smells on those subsequent visits. Because this part of the rite was not done, the women had to buy and prepare spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the third day. They definitely had not to wash the deceased’s naked body at all but just to anoint his linen wrappings. Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period might well have been duly completed within a minimum of a two hours and a half time frame.”.","date":"2013-03-20","mins":"6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"id":"comment-157234","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh’s too good to be true camel consists in believing the TS is “a 1260 1390 c CE image”.

Scientificamente, quelle anomali temperature sono studiate, nel 1920, dal dottor Giorgio Festa, perché, avendone sentito parlare, non crede che un fenomeno sia possibile per un essere umano. Ha un suo metodo di studio: misura la temperatura a Padre Pio due volte al giorno ed ordina ai superiori del convento che nessuno debba farlo in sua assenza. Nel suo rapporto, il dottor Festa, afferma che vi sono giorni in cui la febbre di Padre Pio va dai 36.oo ai 36.5 °C, ed altri giorni in cui riscontra 48 48.5 °C. Quando queste forti temperature compaiono, il corpo del frate è molto sofferente e si agita nel letto, ma non c’è ombra di delirio o quegli scombussolamenti che, in genere, si manifestano dopo stati febbrili forti.

Dopo l’incontro col santo, al commendatore cadde il fazzoletto che Padre Pio raccolse con le sue mani e lo porse al signor Francesco. Ritornati dopo alcuni anni per commemorare la morte del frate, Cavicchi dopo aver sognato Padre Pio prese il fazzoletto in chiesa per asciugarsi il volto e da quel momento notò i due volti impressi.” “La storia del fazzoletto appartenuto dal commendator Francesco Cavicchi, e per tanti anni custodito nella villetta di via Croce a Conegliano, è già di per sè abbastanza misteriosa. Nel 1967 i coniugi Cavicchi andarono in pellegrinaggio a San Giovanni Rotondo e incontrarono Padre Pio. Al commendatore cadde un fazzoletto, il frate lo raccolse e glielo consegnò. L’anno dopo il frate morì e i coniugi nel 1969 decisero di tornare a San Giovanni Rotondo. E’ in quell’occasione che, secondo il racconto di Cavicchi, il fazzoletto mostrò improvvisamente ai due lati i volti di Gesù e del frate di Pietrelcina, che non scomparvero mai più (…)”.","date":"2014-11-18","mins":"4:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-171945","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"It could be a ‘PI Ous fraud’ (Latin: PIA fraus) as well (pun intended)….","date":"2014-11-18","mins":"4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-171947","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"….as (at first sight) it looks like ninhydrin has turned dark, obscuring Padre Pio face imprint and was then treated with a ninhydrin clearing reagent to remove the darkened layer uncovering the developed latent face imprint..","date":"2014-11-18","mins":"4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-171948","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Standard formulations for ninhydrin can cause the active chemicals on THERMAL porous surfaces (paper, textile) to turn dark..","date":"2014-11-18","mins":"4:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-171952","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"In other words an application of fingerprint powder to Padre Pio face imprint on the handkerchief cannot totally be ruled out..","date":"2014-11-18","mins":"5:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-172110","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Dan, how come my comments are still awaiting moderation?

Reminder 1: Dead kings’ cave tombs and corpse could be fumigated (see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum). Hence, in the hypothesis the Turin Shroud is Yeshu’a’s, the body could have been subjected to a specific purifying/drying out ancient Judean ritual in the shape of fumigation/burning aromatic woods/spices and at least one incense pan to hold burning charcoal could have been used. Most likely the body image only affected a superficial thin layer of impurities made of starch, lignin, pectin, saponin, hemicellulose deposits and/or flax wax. 2: Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with water can gelatinize starch at 55° 85°C and act as as a extremely fine printing paste. Then Kelly asked: “Is the Maillard reaction, in of itself, sufficient to explain the (uniform) degree of resolution of a collimated image?” Not at all! Adhesion of water insoluble (e.g. Iron oxyde and/or other “opaques”/silica particles present in the desert of Judea dust) onto the blood covered body skin and/or receiving flax surface are most needed so as to collimate the TS man’s image, which implies a tightly wrapped up body and then the long shroud used as inner shroud, gradually loosening somehow back and front though shrinking up. Reminder: the Sharaf (the biblical Ru Ha Qâdim or East Wind) is an Israel dust wind more commonly known as Khamsin or the Dark Breath of the desert of Judea. Then Kelly asked: “For me, the Maillard reaction makes sense, but by itself has some issues why the calves, buttocks don’t appear more flattened, differentially resolute in certain areas?” When will Kelly et al seriously consider the TS man’s stiff rigid corpse could have been first wrapped up and then laid out IN EXTRA HEIGHT on two raised stones to be subjected to a ritual myrrhic aloetic fumigation in the antechamber. Reminder: this implies the presence of 5 6 buriers. Also note: A resin such as that of the fragrant myrrh has always been associated with fumigation and purification rituals. As a ‘funeral’ herb, myrrh is said to ease grief and heal emotional wounds, bringing peace and calm. Besides it has anti microbial properties. When burned with moistening rotten aloe wood chips (moistening helps produce more smoke), some carbon monoxide is liberated along with smoke. According to my thesis, the Sindon Image is a cryptovolumetric bloody body cloth CONTACT AND GRADUAL LOSS OF CONTACT 2 D to 3 D IMAGE resulting from a collimated/auto regulated light (or pre )mordanting of a thin carbohydrate layer of impurities. My thesis neither include nor preclude the TSM’s resurrection or coming back to life. Final reminder: A full body silicone medical mannequin realistic replica of the Sindon Man with water chamber (to be filled with heated water to simulate body and body hyperthermia temperatures) and fully jointed neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles (to provide a deathlike range of similar rigor mortis positions) + 3 4 sets of ad hoc linen cloths (both medieval and late antique replicas) are most needed so that the Sindon’s Man specific burial could be reconstructed..","date":"2013-05-22","mins":"9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/21/the-pig-experiment-was-not-barries-experiment/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The pig experiment was not Barrie’s experiment"},{"id":"comment-10438","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Don’t you ever forget, it is common knowledge in archaeology, glyptology and criminology to use flash in an oblique angle to make appear imprints/impressions that do not appear under other lightings..","date":"2012-04-16","mins":"7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/the-image-on-david-rolfes-website-absence-of-eyebrows/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Image on David Rolfe’s Website:   Absence of Eyebrows?"},{"id":"comment-34344","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder for YC: There are myrrhic aloetic particles in the threads not on the surface (Baima Bollone) of the Shroud and on the surface of the Sudariumf of Oviedo.

How long will DWZN deliberately ignores (out of his ill rancour and stubborn ignorarrogance) the mechanic return force of a linen fabric soaked with warm alkaline waters (spring waters mixed with ashes of the Red heifer or rainwater collected in water reservoir hewn out in malky rock stone) as possible archaeological parameters to be taken into account within the Sindon Man ritual burial’s reconstruction? How long will he ignore (still out of his ill rancour and stubborn ignorarrogance ) the possibility for such a long in soaked inner linen burial cloth to have been first taut lengthwise and then tightly wrapped up width wise around a corpse (to counteract its rigor mortis)? Such a specific wrapping of the corpse might well accoutn for the inner long cloth while shrinking to sort of get taut again during a purifying and drying up ritual (myrrhic aloetic fumigation of the corpse resting in extra height on two stones, first on its left and then right side).

My opinion as a professional archaeocryptologist is that the laws of nature, men and G.od could be the KEY to solve the image formation process mystery as far as a specific Judean burial ritual is concerned. I mean G.od as a provider here of a PROVIDENTIAL (hence half ‘miraculous’) image of Yeshua left to Christians.Supernature/True Life magic is everywhere at work in…nature e.g. My own body cells DAYLY PRODUCE DNA 300,000 KM for their rejuvenation and the very maintenance of my life. They are not that many those even among Christians who really care about daily ‘ordinary’ miracles. Who is even aware of them? What now if there is no direct link between the TS image and Yeshua’s alleged resurrection? Or to put it in other words, what if the latter’s body was not resurrected through the sindon at all but Yeshua had just taken it off his body leaving the blood clots intact as his body skin, blood clots and inner long burial cloth had dried out and the cloth mechanically gotten unstuck through shrinking via his stiff rigid body fumigation drying/purifying ritual? 1st reminder: The buriers had to do without the spicy perfumed oils on Yeshua’s burial and his innocent blood had been shed by the Sanhedrin and Roman soldiers. Since his shed innocent blood couldn’t be atoned by men, his corpse was all the more to be honoured and purified one way or another by those same buriers (among whom at least two Sanhedrin members) who did not take a hand in his being sentenced to death. Since the corpse was left in the open for more than an hour, corpse colonizing flies had laid eggs in countless numbers on the body’s natural orifices (ears, eyes, nose, and genitals) or any open wounds (hence the use of a sudarium on the cross to wrap up the TS man’s head). In all likelihood, the corpse was purified by in soaking the long inner burial sheet with alkaline waters (waters mixed with ashes and/or Jerusalem malky stone dust) to kill the eggs 2nd reminder: The TS image was not really PR Ojected onto the cloth surface but sort of gradually RETROPR Ojected as the long inner burial cloth somehow got taut again (through shrinking and watery solution evaporation) and gradually unstuck front and back from the body skin in blood via a fumigation and drying out ritual..","date":"2012-10-31","mins":"6:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18668","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Louis, why do you care so much for the form and so little for the content?.","date":"2012-10-31","mins":"8:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18664","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typos: “flesh or corpse colonizing flies had deposited larvae in countless numbers around/on the body’s natural orifices (ears, eyes, nose, rectum and genitals) or any open wounds” “to kill larvae” In terms of blood pattern analysis, the blood on the Turin Sindon comes from exudates of (alkaline water?) remoistened/dampened relatively fresh blood clots, rivulets and drippings..","date":"2012-10-31","mins":"7:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18670","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"I don’t belong to any church, temple, synagogue or mosque and I write English as I write/can write English (note it is only one year, I started currently writing up comments in English on this very blog and to the two sole exceptions at Fascati in 2010 and Torun in 2012, I hadn’t practiced English for the past 25 years and not that very much even before)..","date":"2012-10-31","mins":"8:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18674","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"In Hebrew the very name Yeshua DOES have a meannig: ‘[providential] Salvation’.","date":"2012-10-31","mins":"8:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18675","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Even when I speak Arabic I say Yeshua’ not ‘Issa….","date":"2012-10-31","mins":"8:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18684","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"One of my best friends’ name was ‘Issa (he untimely died in 2009).

In other words, they are not “superficial images” but in the thickness of the linen fabric and do completely run through the material (capillary action). They are dried fluid images. This is pretty obvious ONLY when the said areas are observed in transmitted light or from photograph taken in transmitted light (see 1988 Riggi photographs). French Shroud scholar Marcel Alonso noticed it well before me: “L’hypothèse de la double superficialité de l’image (Fanti, Rogers, 2005) est démentie par l’image en transmission prise par Riggi en 1988, qui montre qu’elle existe bien dans l’épaisseur du tissu.” and “les images par transmission laissent voir un léger épaississement des fils, dans les mailles (pourtant lâches), confirmant la présence de l’image dans la profondeur du tissage. En effet, les fils dont le diamètre est 100 fois plus grand que les fibres n’ont pu piéger un surcroît de liquides, colloïdes et particules associées, qu’aux points de contacts entre eux. Ce seront les zones ayant retenu dans leurs mailles le plus de fluides qui apparaîtront après séchage les plus sombres (celles au contact des cheveux, moustache, barbe, sourcils…). C’est une preuve supplémentaire en faveur du principe d’image capillaire, opposé au à celui d’image radiative.” (the above mentioned observations are extracted from a paper entitled “Le Linceul est il Surnaturel ?” Alonso wrote in 2005). On February , 2012, I quoted French Shroud scientist Marcel Alonso: “The hypothesis of the double superficiality of the [face Shroud] image (Fanti, Rogers, 2005) is belied by the image in transmitted light taken by Riggi in 1988. [To the sole exception of the right side of the Shroud man’s long flowing hair], the image shows that it does exist in the thickness of the fabric (on the backside of the long linen cloth)”. In spite of image enhancement, most of the left side of the face actually does not even clearly appear on the backside of the long linen cloth. There are more than some caveats re “double superficiality”. And on March 16, 2014 at 6:06 am I wrote: “Alonso provides the right explanation re the image apparent non uniformity in a few areas: “les fils dont le diamètre est 100 fois plus grand que les fibres n’ont pu piéger un surcroît de liquides, colloïdes et particules associées, qu’aux points de contacts entre eux. Ce seront les zones ayant retenu dans leurs mailles le plus de fluides qui apparaîtront, après séchage, les plus sombres (celles au contact des cheveux, moustache, barbe, sourcils…)”, which implies (my own explanation) they fit in rather neatly with tighter wrapping up in shrouds or more cloth to body/body to cloth pressures in these most specific areas.” The image is uniformly and not randomly superficial per se. “Reminder: in my ritualistic hypothesis, the tightly wrapped up body would have been dried out in extra height resting on its right side (and then left side?) NOT in suspine position. Besides, it cannot either be totally ruled out the fabric had ORIGINALLY(i.e. Once woven) been put in the field to dry out on one side only.”.","date":"2014-10-15","mins":"8:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"id":"comment-160076","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: can stare into the eyes of the attentive observer.","date":"2014-10-07","mins":"5:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"id":"comment-160097","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Methinks too, there’s is no stochastic imaging process involved in The TS bloodied body image..","date":"2014-10-07","mins":"7:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"id":"comment-85218","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"OK wrote: “There were also suggestions, by Marion & Courage, that wooden supports for head were used during the burial.” Actually, they only suggested a head shaped hole carved out in the STONE bench, not wooden supports at all.

Hence the shroud that had been bought by Joseph (III) of Aramathia can be read in the bibical light of the Joseph ben Jacob and his half brothers’ story: Joseph (I) was sold as slave for 20 pieces of silver. The half brothers then dipped his coat/garment into the blood of a slaughtered male goat and brought it back to Jacob as proof of his death. Jacob deeply mourned for his son, believing him dead though he was not.

That ceremony created a ritual identification between the covenantors and the cut up animal. Now if we take a look at the Tor(ell)ino/Turin Shroud, the faintly apparent frontal and dorsal bloody imprints of the crucifixion victim look divided on the inner side of the linen cloth and, symbolically speaking, can be read as a sign of a convenant/sacrifice/man ‘cut in twain’… Just a thought….","date":"2013-08-29","mins":"6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/27/when-is-a-scorch-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"When is a Scorch NOT a Scorch?"},{"id":"comment-42297","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"It also works in French Taurillon/T(a)uri(llo)n = Turin = Torino, Tori(nell)o.","date":"2013-08-29","mins":"6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/27/when-is-a-scorch-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"When is a Scorch NOT a Scorch?"},{"id":"comment-5270","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Donald is right to a certain extent.

This is a received idea. In my 1998 Turin paper, I demonstrated the Shroud man burial time frame should be reconsidered in the light of « the midday night » (through the eyes of a Judean of the first Temple period, there were two nights and two days on that very day). Actually, two hours and a half as a minimum burial time frame is a much fairer estimate than just half an hour. You also wrote: “The Synoptics all say that the Galillee women witnessed the burial. Earliest gospel Mark has Mary Magdalen and Mary mother of James purchasing spices on Sunday morning to annoint him, corroborated by Luke who has the women going off to prepare spices. If (Rabbi Yeshua) was already tied up as Max asserts, why would the women (prepare spices on Sunday morning to annoint him), unless they merely intended making up for some missed ritual.” This is another received idea.The women’s visit to the tomb on the following Sunday is to be read in the light of a specific Judean tradition which consisted to pay visit to the deceased during the week that followed his death. The use of (liquid) perfume here was just to prevent bad smells (to soak the deceased’s wrapping linens with) The bloodstains on the Shroud look undisturbed. In Steve’s eye, the very fact that the Shroud was not removed from the body during the image formation process is a “clear” sign of resurrection. Is it really so? Couldn’t this “clear” sign of resurrection just be another pro Shroud authenticity Christians’ received idea? Is it impossible for a previously tautly wrapped Shroud (soaked with water mixed with ashes) to just separate from a remoistened blood stained body through gradual pressure release? Couldn’t a tightly wrapped up stiff rigid body resting first on the left and then on the right side and in extra height on two stones and being subjected to a myrrho aleotic fumigation be a much more fitting scenario? Through evaporation and gradual pressure release, the interior shroud (soaked with a watery solution) could have gradually lost contact with the blood stained body. Owing to the purifying and drying up ritual, blood could not have time to cement to the shroud. Couldn’t “a direct contact/gradual loss of contact mechanism” be a much more naturalistic explanation? In a recent post I wrote : “In accordance with the halakha (religious rules), any Judean dead of a violent death was to be buried “with his bloods”. In case of shed of innocent blood by the Sanhedrin, just because such innocent blood could not be atoned, it should also be purified. Most obviously, the Man of the Shroud’s body (still in hyperthermis) was not directly washed. Most probably his interior burial sheet was all soaked with the waters of Red Heifer or Cow (ritual ashes mixed with pure living water) and his tightly enshrouded stiff body placed first on his left side and then on his right side (at head and knee level?) upon two stones and in extra height above a slab to be submitted to a myrrho aloetic fumigation as if the man of the Shroud were a prince or a notable. Such a specific taharah or ritual purification might as well account for the “weightlessness effect”, part of the 1988 wrong official carbon 14 dating and the overall formation process of the body image (with such neat and almost fresh looking blood imprints on the linen fabric). Since the double imprint might well result from an overall gradual pressure release of the soaked long interior linen cloth drying up next to the crucifixion victim’s stiff body, a project in experimental archaeology would be most appropriate to reconstruct this specific late ancient Judean burial rite.” (January 20, 2012 at 11:25 am | #31).","date":"2012-02-10","mins":"1:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/08/why-do-we-think-the-resurrection-was-a-process-what-if-it-was-not/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process?
