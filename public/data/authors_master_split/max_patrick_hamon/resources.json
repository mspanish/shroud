[{"id":"comment-200347","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh, keep up misrepresenting others’ opinion and Herculaneum findings as far as scourge marks (for the former) and flagra (for the latter) are concerned. You wrote: “These couple of exceptions are the thin end of a wedge which will eventually mean that ALL (uppe cases mine) the alleged flagra are rejected”. By whom? By you (not Flavia Manservigi). Are you rejecting too the finding of flagra in Herculaneum? How do you account for the extant xylographies of flagra then? How can you tell they are not flagra either and will eventually be rejected? Where did you get your allegedly ‘superior archaeological knowledge of flagra’ from to be so negatively assertive? Methinks you are light years’ far from being an archaeologist of whips and scourges! Reminder for Hugh: CURRENT redirecting of the original function of the same object (e.g. A decorative pendant redirected as a scourge) can result in (a) new object (s) (e.g. A flagrum and/or a flagellum). The concept of habitus is the cornerstone here. In sharp contrast, ‘your approach’ of Roman whips/scourges is only based on “processual archaeology”. The latter arrived at explanations based on monocausal intentionality of human relationships with things, if any human action was considered to be intentional at all. In principle, it was assumed that every object had its own specific function and that this object was created by man with the intention of exactly fulfilling this function. Thus you totally ignore “post processual archaeology. The latter has always emphasised the plurality of an object’s functions. Particular strands of post processual archaeology replace the monocausal intentionality of processual archaeology by polycausal intentionality. In their view, humans do not create objects with a single function in mind, but do so with several possible functions in mind. You are not even aware meanwhile more and more approaches try to improve on processual and post processual archaeology. Archaeology owes important thought provoking impulses to French sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Bruno Latour, namely Bourdieu’s concept of habitus and Latour’s actor network theory (ANT). In contrast to the dominating mentalist approaches in anthropology and sociology in the 1970s, Bourdieu rightly acknowledged the importance of the material in human living environments. He thereby created possible approaches for archaeologists who have only completely taken up these possibilities over the last twenty years. Bourdieu’s (1987) concept of habitus is based on the notion that, to a large extent, our practices with things are governed by unconscious internalisation of collective dispositions. Therefore, humans act in a way that is specific to their social background, often without being aware of this and without acknowledging the important influence of their material surroundings on them. These material surroundings shape the habitus, where things are integrated within social practices. Archaeology can only yield momentary meanings and functions of an object..","date":"2015-05-27","mins":"11:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/a-treasure-of-reading-material/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Treasure of Reading Material"},{"id":"comment-200419","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Etymology of Hugh: it refers to somebody who says/claims he is all thinker: hug (“thought,reflection, intellect”) from Aramaic H Ou G for “mental activity”.

Flavia Manservigi confirms my opinion (see my post on May 19, 2015 at 2:02 pm) namely “It does seem the flagrum/flagra used on the TS man’s naked back is/are an in between(s) i.e. Between a common flagrum (see above) and a flagrum talis tessellatum/tesseratum”. According Flavia Manservigi: “Probably, the flagrum used to scourge the man of the Shroud was a rough object, made of chains or lashes ending with heavy knobs, maybe of the type quoted before (so the plumbum and plumbata). As we have seen, the use of these tools in the first centuries of the Roman world is witnessed by historical, literary and iconographical sources. ARCHAEOLOGICAL WITNESSES But what about Archaeology? Are there any Archaeological witnesses of the Roman era confirming the use of whips compatible to the ones used to scourge the Man of the Shroud? It is necessary to state that the great part of the instruments used to scourge criminals can not have preserved, since they were made of natural (and so perishable) materials, like leather or wood. For this reason, it will be very unlikely to find specimens of virgae, ferulae or Spanish cords.The same matter applies to the flagrum with astragals, even if it is possible that single parts of it have preserved, like for example the bones. For what concerns flagra made of chains and metal balls, we have some indications about the existence of such kind of tools in some dictionaries of Archaeology: we can quote a specimen mentioned in the Dictionary of Antony Rich, dated to 1890, which, according to the author, was found at Herculaneum and so was surely dated to the 1st century34. This information is reported also in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities by William Smith35, in the Dictionary of Roman and Greek Archaeology by Daremberg and Saglio36 and in the dictionary of Christian Archaeology by Cabrol and Leclercq37. In all these cases, the specimens are reproduced with xylographies. 34 A. RICH, A dictionary…, p. 289, s.v. Flagrum. 35 W.

Now potassium gives only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) is giving strong signal. The true fact is low temperature (55° 85° C) alkali gelatinisation of starch residuals present in the ancient linen cloth could be a possible factor to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process in terms of bubbling printing paste – Bilirubin is neither the problem nor the solution here, just probably one part of the whole equation.

CE Stuttgart Psalter flogging scene, Yeshu’a’s scourge marks are already represented: On October 21, 2013 at 7:15 am, I wrote: “Re the Psalter miniature and TS dorsal frontal image Christ like figure connection, to the astute observer: ●Both are stark naked with long flow of hair in the back; a hair flow that originally was braid from top into a narrow pigtail but has come half undone. In the miniature, the whole pigtail can be made out from top to tip as it appears slightly darker and longer in the hair flow. ●Both have arm(s) bound and/or crossed in front. Had both no scourged and/or furrow marks on the inner side arms? This cannot be checked today any longer. ●Both have bloodied furrow and/or scourged marks in conjunction with two whips with lashes each fitted with doubled pellets implying two executioners. ●Both have almost feminine curved left hip & thigh (later to be called “the Byzantine curve”). In the miniature the pelvis is shown three quarters as a mishmash of the TS frontal and dorsal images. ●Both are/were tied at frontal tibiofibular level with left leg in front of right leg (TS man accurate Forensic description from both frontal and dorsal views: left leg in front of right leg with rope marking in the tibiofibular fleshes). ●Both show a most unnatural/awkward feet position as the three quarter back view stark naked Christ like figure being flogged in the miniature combines the TS dorsal and frontal images to be readable. ●And last but not least, by means of a very intriguing tailed Epsilon hand sign each time formed with unnaturally curved fingers, the executioner on the left seem to point with his left hand index finger to his own head while the executioner on the right does point to Christ’s head with his left hand index finger too. Both left hand signs cryptically resemble the tailed Epsilon shaped like bloodstain pattern decal we can observe on TS man’s forehead, just above his left eyebrow. In a Descent from the Cross miniature from the Bamberg Psalter, (ca 1255 CE, Melk, Stiftsbibliothek), Yeshu’a’s is depicted with a transparent loincloth with scourge marks all over his body. 2/ “The wound and welts and open sores” (scourge marks included) are also symbolically represented as stylised flowers or palmettes in conjunction with an himation/sindon in 1267 1268 CE Malatia Armenian Gospel Iconography or red crosses see the Hungarian 1163 1195 Pray Ms bifolium folio 28r lower section.

Thank you. I can read Modern French, Old French, a few Old French dialects, Classical Latin, Medieval Latin and Ecclesiastical Latin all right, what about you? I photocopied and read the POULLE’s whole article in 2006, in the very semester it was published, which led me to read both Ulysse Chevalier articles’ 1900 and 1903 versions (in “Bulletin d’histoire et d’archéologie du diocèse de Valence”, t.20, p. 113 167 and in Memories of the Academy of Sciences, Great Literature and Arts of Lyon, 3rd series t.7, p. 237 312). I STILL think you just cannot read Emmanuel POULLE’s French correctly and totally missed Ulysse Chevalier’s manipulation of the documentary evidence. Shall I remind you: Re the APPEARANCE of truth As early as the end of the 14th c CE, it was agreed Clement VII took a position clear and cut against authenticity of the TS: it was indeed the obvious conclusion upon the reading the documents published by the canon Ulysse Chevalier more than a hundred years ago… Re the archivistic REALITY …till in 2006, Emmanuel POULLE published his work in a peer reviewed journal (“Revue d’Histoire de l’Eglise de France, t.92, p.344 5358) and convincingly demonstrated the documents in question were falsified by the canon. Just in case you hadn’t read it (and methinks you hadn’t), here are a few excerpts from an article published in the RILT, n° 20,p. 10 15, June 2007 and entitled: “Examination of the file published by Ulysse Chevalier” (I do hope you’ll be able to understand what the article REALLY say in English since French language and Latin subtleties do seem just to elude you). “Emmanuel POULLE submitted a new examination of the file published by Ulysse Chevalier, and he dismantles the MECHANISM (upper cases mine) WHICH TRANSFORMED what should have been a serene and strictly scientific erudite work in a machine of (intellectual) war TO MAKE THE dug up DOCUMENTS SAY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT SAID (upper cases mine”). “(In his 1900 article) Ulysse Chevalier had retained for his edition the first version (of the bull) ether becaus it was in better coherence with Pierrre d’Arcis’ report, or because it answeed better than the second on his own conviction (UC’s) about the attitude of the Church in front of the gullibility of ancient times. The textual variants of the qualified version with regards to the edited version were, according to practice followed for scientific edition of the historic sources, sent back in critical apparatus, thus printed in small characters, at the bottom of the page, so that the TEXT of this SECOND VERSION passed UNNOTICED; and actually, NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE NOTICED that the VARIANTS of the critical apparatus were NOT OF PURE SHAPE, BUT PRODUCED A TEXT SOLEMNLY DIFFERENT from the published text.” Re the corrections to the first bull version: “The deletions and additions basically came down to two major corrections: – The first one consists of the abolition of part of bans formulated in the first version: no further mention of preventing the clergy from dressing in his priestly clothes during ostensions, only remains the limitation of the profusion of light to which ostensions gave place. The second correction concerns the very question of authenticity of the shroud: while the first version ordered the clergy to assert peremptorily that the relic preserved at Lirey was a forgery, the second was content in asking that, during the solemnities of the ostension it was specified that these solemnities were due, not to the shroud itself, but to the presence of the image of Christ. The correction was made by moving the “non significance” (“figura predicta non est verum sudarium”) became “figuram predictam non ostendunt ut verum sudarium”), by getting rid of the almost offensive name of the shroud “pictura seu tabula” and by playing on the sense of neutrality of (the Latin phrase) “figura seu representatio”, WHICH DOES NOT FORSEE THE NATURE OF THE “FIGURE” IN QUESTION, first appeared as painted, then for which the presence of the image on the shroud is simply noted. As A MATTER OF FACT, the Pope contented himself to recommend to proceed with caution during ostensions of the relic.” The fact remains there are strong yet subtle differences in both versions: “THE FIRST VERSION THAT ULYSSE CHEVALIER WANTED TO PASS, AND THE SECOND (and definite version) WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONLY VERSION TO BE HELD BUT WHICH HE DELIBERATELY MADE UNRECOGNISABLE.” (for the two different versions one uncorrected and the other corrected see ib. P.13) “Thus the conclusion is VITAL: the Papal chancellery had AT FIRST intended to make his position which Pierre d’Arcis had expressed in his report, which remember, is only known by a copy and it had asserted the falseness of the shroud and forbidden ostensions be made in solemnity; THEN, investigation made, it had appreciably (re)qualified his instructions. Moreover, we will note that in the part of the bull of general reach which was not the object of corrections, therefore from its first version (it was the object of that of the four bulls which was specifically sent to him), about the question of the public ostensions of the shroud which took place at Lirey, a perpetuum silentium, which looks like an invitation to be quiet.” Reminder here: re pilgrimage making and money making, Pierre d’Arcis was in conflict of interest with Geoffroy de Charny II. “What’s more, confirming this change of point of view on the shroud (investigation made), the Pope, at that same time as he was having the bull of general reach corrected inearly J Une 1390, another bull was being written to ENCOURAGE THE PILGRIMAGE TO LIREY, bull which formulated NO RESERVE OF ANY KIND EITHER ON THE RELIC OR IN ITS OSTENTIONS: it is the “L” document of the file of 1903, that Ulysse Chevalier had not heard of in 1900 and that he discovered four years later when recording in the Registers of Avignon. The 1903 file, containing the new version of the published bulls four years later as well as this “L” document, could thus appear as A REHABILITATION OF THE SHROUD which the 1900 file had rather manhandled; unfortunately it was not the case BECAUSE OF THE UNSPEAKABLE BEHAVIOUR OF ITS PUBLISHER (aka ULYSSE CHEVALIER). Denied, in a sense, by the versions of the bulls found in the Avignonnais Registers, dressed in more authenticity than the copies devoid of any sign of (official) validity” which he has used in 1900, Ulysse Chevalier should have, in all honesty, recognised that he had made the bad choice and he should have published in “Autour des Origines”, the version that he had primitively rejected. Not only did did he not do so but he repeated in 1903, STRICTLY UNCHANGED, the already published FALSE VERSION, but, by continuing to relegate the right one in a harmless critical apparatus, he was careful not to indicate that the difference between the two versions was based on a series of deletions and corrections; whilst the first version was henceforth non longer, as in 1900? an option which no one would have been able to continue to consider defensible, he sinned by omission, and by grave omission, by abstaining from mentioning that it had formally been rejected by the office of the Pope, otherwise by the Pope himself.” Ulysse Chevalier’s stubbornness (to maintain the first version of the bull of January 1390, while he had it followed by the text of the June bull the same year, which contradicted it, ending up as a file of incoherence), disqualified him definitively. “Clement VII took by no means the responsibility of the assertions hurled without proof by Pierre d’Arcis, to say the shroud, then kept at Lirey was false, a painting made by an individual who has been identified and who has recognized his work. (The true fact is the Pope) encourages the believers (the “L” file) to continue to come and honour the shroud of Christ.”.","date":"2014-10-22","mins":"8:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"id":"comment-164840","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Da M, You wrote: “Don’t deconstruct the text, please”… … when I was just quoting the passage in Latin “figuram predictam non ostendunt ut verum sudarium, sed tanquam figuram dicti sudarii Domini” you clearly misunderstood and therefore addressing your main point !

Here are the literary synthesis: “[In the church of My Lady Saint Mary of the Pharos (“lighthouse”) in the Golden Imperial Palace of the Boucoleon in Constantinople and another church called My Lady Saint Mary of Blachernae], Christ ‘rise[d] again’ [then], and the sindon(1) with the burial linens [was] the clear proof. [This sindon] as white as snow from antiquity, [was] of linen, of easily obtainable material, remained uncorrupted and smell[ed] fragrant of myrrh. [It] def[ied] decay because, after the Passion, it [had] wrapped the elusive(2) dead naked body. [When] raised upright, not only the image of the glorious features of the Saviour’s face with dripping drops of blood shine[d] out but also the form and most noble stature of his entire body hanging down from the cross and embellished with drops of blood and water that make the liquid flow from his own side, could be plainly seen. This [was] not the art of the painter and the various beautiful colours, which provide a door for the mind to consider the original and depict images [that could possibly have depicted] the reflection of his appearance and size imprinted on [his sindon]. [So much so] the ‘not made by hand’ image of Christ and G od, draped with a white/pure linen cloth he had worn, was sufficiently in lieu of the vision of the Lord coming into the flesh to those who had not corporally seen him. After the city was taken, the French partitioned the relics of the saints and the most sacred of all, the sindon in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before his resurrection. We know the sacred sindon in Athens. [In this city] we saw with our own eyes the burial linen cloths found in the sepulchre.” Doesn’t it reads as strong historical evidence indeed and tends to prove the presence of the most famous contact and blood relic of Christianity at Constantinople prior to 1204? Notes: (1). – Also called sydoine and synne1 in old French; the latter for “sign” (Latin signum; Greek symbulos). (2). – Greek aperilepton, i.e. Consistent both on one hand with G od’s “un circumscribed”, non coercive and loving, divine nature that has no shapes, is beyond description and the binds of Death cannot contain and, on the other hand, Yeshua’s “un outlined”, evanescent nature of his own image on his sindon. Hope English Roman Historian, Charles Freeman can arguably reply with more than a mere wave of the hand declaring ‘irrelevant’ any testimonies and eyewitness descriptions of the Shroud (now kept in Turin) prior to HIS ‘1300s. Are literary, iconographic and archaeological pieces of evidence prior to 1300s REALLY irrelevant because they are in blatant contradiction with Mr Freeman’s alleged ‘theory’ and he just doesn’t want to hear about them?.","date":"2014-10-21","mins":"6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"id":"comment-164390","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Charles you wrote: “there is NOT A SHRED OF EVIDENCE that it is the Shroud that they are referring to”.

Reminder: as early as the 4th c. CE John Chrysostom (c.347 CE–c.407 CE), archbishop of Constantinople and Augustine (354 CE– 430 CE), bishop of Hippo totally disagreed on its interpretation. Most unfortunately, the exegesis bias came in with John Chrysostom who misunderstood and overtranslated (for liturgical purposes?) the said scene. Today most if not all Christians (Catholics et al) ONLY rely on Chrysostom’s faulty/expanded translation and a male dominated Paulinistic Christianism promoting John Chrysostome’s exegesis focusing on Peter & John’s discovery of the empty tomb at the expense of Mary Magdalene’s testimony and Augustine’s most likely correct understanding of the famous verse (in Jn 20:40, the other disciple NOW just believed in what the women had told them namely: Yeshu’a had been taken away from the tomb. Period. To infer John was the sole to understand Yeshua was risen from the dead in the empty tomb scene is plain inaccuracy of translation or overtranslation (i.e. To infer much more than what John actually witnessed then). Reminder, on January 3, 2013 at 1:00 pm, I wrote: In Joannis Evangelium Tractatus CXXIV) Augustine of Hippo wrote: “And he saw, and believed.” Here some, BY NO GIVING DUE ATTENTION (upper cases mine), suppose that John believed that Jesus had risen again; but there is no indication of this from the words that follow. For what does he mean by immediately adding, “For as yet they knew not the scripture, that He must rise again from the dead”? He could not then have believed that He had risen again, when he did not know that it behoved Him to rise again. What then did he see? what was it that he believed? What but this, that he saw the sepulchre empty, and believed what the woman had said, that He had been taken away from the tomb?” …and further on in the following tractate: “Mary Magdalene had brought the news to His disciples, Peter and John, that the Lord was taken away from the sepulchre; and they, when they came thither, found only the linen clothes wherewith the body had been shrouded; and what else could they believe but what she had told them, and what she had herself also believed?” (As early as 1994 and as far as the empty tomb scene exegesis is concerned, I came to the same conclusion as Augustine of Hippo’s without even having previously heard of it. So did William Meacham, see http://freepages.religions.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wmeacham/ton) According to the Gospels, Yeshu’a had to open his disciples’ mind to the scriptures… AFTER his death. And in this regard, John is in no really better off than Peter since THEY (i.e. John included) had NOT YET understood Yeshu’a’s was actually to rise from the dead according to the scripture. How long will this MISTAKEN VIEW (John was the first to perceive the real significance of Yeshua’s empty tomb on that very morning) be dominant among Christians?

No wonder then all the faith archimiraculist shroudies placed in “the empty tomb scene” had to be eroded to the core in spite of all their endless attempts to forcefully have the long inner burial winding sheet aka Turin Shroud aka sindon ‘get back into’ the empty tomb scene at all costs and ‘prove’ John saw (and understood) sthg Peter didn’t and was the first of the disciples to have faith in Yeshua’s resurrection.

CE as if Pliny was living in the Middle Ages and practicing Medieval Latin; your use of depinxit instead of depinxerat; your unability to figure out the chain like crest and valley configuration of the back of a muscular and venous right forearm bulging and your additional unability to get the very idea depinxerat in Pierre D’Arcy memorandum could mean the artist had not only ‘painted’ but cunningly reproduced/copied” what Christ Shroud could have been like whether making a more elaborate copy/reproduction of a threnos epitaphios like Shroud or another then existing Shroud painted copy). This was a bit too much! – Re Late Antique and Medieval Latin verb copio, copiare. You are right. I did mix all my links up and got totally confused here. No question the Latin 1st singular person present indicative copio, “I copy” is not a synonym of copiare, “to copy”, but the present infinitive. I also mixed up most of my links. It does happen at times when I am really overworked and harassed by a long winded commentator who has an unfair discourse, keeps putting words in my mouth and deliberately/unconsciously misrepresent my real opinion! In sum, yes I confess I got really tired and confused! In 1988, as a relevant ALTERNATIVE translation to depinxerat, I first thought Pierre d’Arcy could have used the Latin conjugated verb (pluperfect active indicative) depinxerat (not depinxit, perfect active indicative, as you most erroneously stated) to mean the artist HAD not so much “painted” as “made a painted copy/reproduction” or to put it differently “copied/reproduced” the Lirey Shroud or a Christ Shroud. – In 1991, French scholar Bruno Bonnet Eymard (who BTW is far more familiar with Latin than both Thibault, Hugh and me put together!), translated depinxerat as “He had reproduced (= copied” since both in English and French “copier/to copy” and “reproduire/to reproduce” are synonymous as far as text transcription and miniature depiction are concerned, which Thibault (a French native speaker who can write in English, most oddly does seem to ignore!). – Taking into account BBE’s acception of depinxerat as “il avait reproduit” (“he had reproduced” I kept the three most relevant acceptions “painted/reproduced/copied” here most likely involved. I am not telling you depinxerat can ONLY translate “he had reproduced/copied”! I am perfectly aware it first and foremost means “he had painted”! STILL the fact remains the medieval/late Medieval Latin copio copiare has no known occurrences in the pluperfect active indicative prior to the second third of the 14th c. CE and there are just a few occurrences of the its perfect active indicative (e.g. Copiavi and ciopiavit), all in conjunction with pope Uban the fifth. My question to you is what EXACTLY is the pluperfect active indicative of the medieval/late medieval verb copio, copiare? SO FAR you have just failed to answer it (STILL waiting for your reply!). I do think, most likely Pierre D’arcy was as ignorant as yourself of the pluperfect active indicative of the medieval/late medieval verb copio, copiare and had to use depinxerat instead. All the more so as he was aware that the Lirey Shroud CUNNINGLY REPRODUCED Christ Shroud! Methinks BBE’s translation is the best suited here.Whence my personal translation of the key passage: Latin key sentence: (…) probatum fuit etiam per artificem qui illum depinxerat, ipsum humano ope factum, nonmiraculose confectum vel concessum (…) My translation in French (with relevant /acceptions/ BBE’s included) : “(…) preuve fut même donnée par un artiste qui l’avait peint/reproduit/copié que de main humaine il avait été fait et non point par miracle réalisé ou bien accordé (…)” STILL another fact remains, etymologically speaking, copio, copiare (as far as painting NOT writing is concerned) via medieval/late medieval Latin verb copiare from copia (from ops, opis, “power, ability, resources”) can mean TO PAINT with resources, ability and power (while multiplying images/illustrations/copies/reproductions) or in other words TO CUNNINGLY PAINT (not just ‘to paint’)..","date":"2015-05-06","mins":"5:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198458","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"What is the third singular person pluperfect active indicative of the late Latin verb copio, copiare?

Had Pierre d’Arcis really meant the artist had painted the Lirey Shroud (that was not a painting btw and the latter fact was already known from old then!) or made a more elaborate/original painted copy with fresh looking blood of the Besançon shroud (a copy of a copy), a threnos epitaphios like Christ lying back on his shroud or any other Christ Shroud copy/reproduction, could Thibault tell us which medieval Latin verb was best suited if depinxerat wasn’t? Can now Thibault tells us what Pierre d’Arcis really meant by “he had painted it”? What was he referring to? Was he referring to an artist that painted the Lirey Shroud or did Henry de Poitier just consulted an artist who once copied/reproduced the Besançon or another Christ Shroud… painted copy (as imitation of an imitation) in terms of susbtitute relic? If the word depinxerat only mean “he had painted” how come then the word could be most ill suited to describe the L Irey Shroud aka Turin Shroud? Was Pierre d’Arcy deliberately/unconsciouly misrepresenting the case to the pope? How come Henry de Poitier’s expert artist mistook the Lirey Shroud image for a painting when most obviously (except for Charles) it was not as far the relic’s aesthetic singularity is concerned? Actually through the eye of a medieval observer, the fully displayed dorsal and frontal image could look more like “an embalmed skin of an old bearded man with four legs, two at the front and two at the back” than a painting (see e.g. The Knights Templar testimonies). Bruno Bonnet Eymard (who is far more familiar with Latin than both Thibault and Hugh put together), translated depinxerat as “He had reproduced (= copied”).

I think you’re right. In fact I said this several posts ago (except for the Templar bit).” In the Grandson antependium, the body of the two archangels’ loroi do appear without any of the addition of Byzantino Byzantine embellishments (no embroidery or appliqued fabric/embroidery, no gemmed trim on the neckline, no pearled cuffs, no hems with pearls and/or precious gems at all. The two Archangels’ Loroi show nothing at all to give the impression of expensive fabric, which is in keeping with Knight Templars’s philosophy of clothing. The altar antependium was made in Cyprus workshop in the 1270s. Now the Knight Templars owned the entire island at that time. The Archangels’ loroi are definitely mingling Western and Byzantine styles. We can even read Gothic inscriptions in Old French (SAINT GABIEL and SAINT MICHIEL). METHINKS (whether Dan like it or not), the loroi her are most likely Templar depictions of the Byzantine loros. METHINKS the knight Templars elite knew about the Shroud (now kept in Turin). If the weaver did not try to represent what he thought was Yeshua’s double length Shroud (now kept in Turin) can Hugh (anyone) account for the late 13th c. CE herringbone patterned loros STRONGLY evocative of the herringbone patterned TS? Or to put it in other words, can you (anyone) account for such an iconographic departure from the traditional depiction of the Byzantine Loros symbolic of Yeshua’s shroud in the 1270s CE?.","date":"2014-11-01","mins":"7:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"id":"comment-167604","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh, you wrote: “You have to demonstrate your expertise (in live).” I think (without much effort) I HAVE.

Besides the word image play on the name of the emperor “Manuel”, an allusion to his young age (24) at his accession to the throne and the Byzantine tradition to use the portrait of Christ as an apotropaic shield (i.e. As both a protection of Christ for the emperor and the coin owner), the three roundels (two and one) of eyes and chin distributed in the manner of the Greek capital letter delta (Δ) upside down, could have either simply been an iconic reduction of the face or featured an interpretation of the Christ Emmanuel as a hypostasis of the Holy Trinity or both. The Greek capital letter delta (Δ) motive in conjunction with three roundels and a portrait of Christ can also be observed in the Sakli/Hidden Church fresco of the Holy Face of the Holy Mandylion (see Sakli Church Image of Edessa Wilson The Shroud.jpg). Symbolically speaking, as an upside down triangle (▽), the Greek capital letter delta motive could refer to Christ incarnation on earth as Byzantines believed that their emperor should represented Christ on Earth while the three beaded ear ring echoes the three roundels (two and one) of eyes and chin.

The loros and mappa were reserved specifically for the emperor. According to Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, the loros and mappa symbolized Christ’s burial winding sheets (a long and a much shorter one). Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos also says that this type ceremonial scarfs should not be worn by any other country’s rulers, but that there were specifically meant as a gift to the Byzantines. As such, the loros along with the mappa were only worn on the holiest days of the year including Easter when the emperor represented the risen Christ.

Besides “The “desacrated” throne is a 3 D alabaster replica at reduced scale of the Hetoimassia (or relic throne of the “Preparation” to the Second Coming of Christ). Hetoimassia, literally “preparation”, meaning “that which has been prepared” or “that which is made ready”, specifically refers to the “sign of the Son of Man” and his return at the Last Judgement. The (4th?) 6th c. St Mark’s cathedra was part and parcel of the booty from the 1204 CE sack of Constantinople by Franks & Venetians.” “The motif essentially consists of an empty throne with a prominent cushion and various Christic relics (among which his burial cloth covering or sitting on the throne and/or his pre burial sudarium/ burial Byssus small face cloth draped round a crux gemmata and/or the ring of twisted rushes, to which thorns were attached to form his crown around or over the cross).” “Here is the link to the Hetoimassia or relic throne known as the cathedra or throne of Saint Mark: http://stephanhuller.blogspot.com/2009/11/my article on throne of st mark has.html The same herrring bone pattern also appears in conjunction with a veil & a full length portrait of Christ in a last quarter of the 8th century CE missal miniature from the Echternach Abbey (founded in 698 CE as a Benedictine monastery by St. Willibrord, an English monk.” “All those representations of an herringbone weave pattern cloth are very rare as far as pre 13th c.

Moons ago, I myself dicussed on this very blog Hebrew/Aramaic to Greek translation entropy For instance: – on August 22, 2012 at 10:38 am, on this very blog I wrote: “Actually in “the Gospel of Mark” the Aramaic is Peter’s not Mark’s…” – And on March 1, 2013 at 2:58 and 3:49) pm: “Paulus/Shaul dictated it (The Letter to the Hebrews he sent to hellenised Judeans) in Aramaic/Hebrew while Lukas/Yair translated it into written Greek (or else the reverse: since Paulus/Shaul was a Judean who was Hellenised and also a Roman citizen, he could have dictated the letter in Greek and had Lukas/Yair translated it into written Hebrew/Aramic)” – And on March 4, 2013 at 9:24 am and 7:27 pm, I wrote: “Dave,you wrote: “… so that it’s if Mark who runs off naked, then clearly it’s not Mark who has his ear cut” as if I had ever claimed the contrary?! This is pretty obvious and was NOT the real issue under discussion! What I don’t really get is the reason why you had the ear cut incident come into the debate. You also wrote: “It would seem that the only really good reason for asserting that Mark was the Sanhedrin’s secretary, was that all other three gospel accounts of the trial adhere to Mark’s version fairly closely, albeit with some minor additions. But both Nicodemus & Joseph of Arimathaea could also have provided oral accounts which all four gospels could have then followed.” Reminder 1: According to Papias: ‘the Elder’ (Presbyter) used to say this, ‘Mark became Peter’s interpreter [hermeneutes, Greek that can also be rendered by ‘translator’ and/or ‘stenographer’] and wrote accurately (Peter’s memoirs). Reminder 2: from a close scrutiny of the High Priest House nightly episode and knowledge of Sanhedrin procedures, the Sanhedrin could only be composed of 3 members.Thus the odds for “Nicodemus & Joseph of Arimathaea” to be both in attendance that very night are very weak. Now if we base our deduction from Hebrew to Greek translation entropy (Gr. Hemeneutes + Gr. Huperethen (applied to the same person namely John Mark) < Heb. Sophereth, 'assistant secretary/assistant scribe = a young man), John (Mark) as High Priest Hanan's assistant/servant secretary (stenographer) does make more sense. Most likely he was the one to let Kêpha/Peter in and reported the dialogue between Yeshua and Hanan. Maybe we can go as far as deducing 'the young man who runs off naked' was John (later to be called) Mark. Maybe. The fact is this crypto exegesis is totally consistent with our knowledge of Second Temple period Sanhedrin procedures, Aramaic/Hebrew to Greek translation entropy and NT Greek Version.\" \"Dave you wrote: Mark 14:53 56: “They led Jesus off to the high priest; and ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS AND THE SCRIBES ASSEMBLED THERE. [Peter warms himself at fire] THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE WHOLE SANHEDRIN were looking for evidence against Jesus on which they might pass the death sentence. SEVERAL indeed brought false evidence against him, but their evidence was conflicting. …” And you comment: “It is plain from Mark that there were rather more present than the three rostered members of the Sanhedrin.” The TRUE fact is this is ONLY PLAIN FROM the above CURRENT TRANSLATION. Is the CURRENT TRANSLATION from the ancient koine Greek version accurate? I very much doubt so. What about the most likely Galilean Aramaic substratum? The same text can be understood in a quite different way, it just depends of the translation strategy (word for word translation vs. Sense for sense translation/source oriented translation vs. Target oriented translation, direct translation vs. Oblique translation (by Vinay & Darbelnet), adequacy vs. Acceptability, formal equivalence vs. Dynamic equivalence (by Eugene Nida), semantic translation vs. Communicative translation (by Peter Newmark), overt translation vs. Covert translation (by Juliane House), documentary vs. Instrumental translation (by Christiane Nord), foreignization vs. Domestication (by Lawrence Venuti), etc. While these binary oppositions have much in common, they reflect different perspectives and emphasize different translation aims and effects). The other TRUE fact is the same text can be translated according to a time perspective more consistent with the real chronology in terms of Yeshua’s trial by the Sanhedrin. The same sentences can be read as follows: 1 They led Jesus off to the high priest 2 And It was there all the chief priests and elders and the scribe WOULD assemble (…) 3 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin HAD BEEN looking for evidence against Jesus on which they might pass the death sentence. Several (witnesses) indeed HAD BROUGHT false evidence against him, but their evidence was conflicting. Reminder for Dave: Yeshu'a HAD ALREADY BEEN judged and sentenced to death in absentia. To confirm a death sentence in presentia ONLY 3 Sanhedrin members were needed.\" Etc..","date":"2015-04-10","mins":"8:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/10/to-every-honest-seeker-of-historical-truth/","cat":"article","title":"To every honest seeker of historical truth"},{"id":"comment-199037","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Colin you wrote: “In a 14th century forgery scenario, the linen did not actually serve, or even need to serve, as a stretcher of body bag.

Firstly, could Colin CLEARLY agree with himself on the real/fictive (?!) use of the TS before disagreeing with me? The very fact of thinking such artistic (and most unrealistic) reconstructions of the Descent of the Cross and Transport to the Tomb are both valid and reliable in terms of forensic and/or archaeological reconstructions definitely does need MORE THAN JUST A STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION! Such artistic reconstruction are in sharp contrast with bloodstain pattern analysis indeed. Reminder for Colin: besides burial a SET OF SHROUDS, PRE burial clothes could have been used (to soak up blood and so prevent excessive blood loss) and heavy sweating can account too for the wounds looking as if washed out neat and clean. Most obviously Colin just cannot discriminate between a state of the art archaeological reconstruction (e.g. That of a Second Temple period wrapping in shrouds from the TS used as long narrow INNER winding burial sheet) and an artistically unrealistic rendering of Yeshua’s body Descent from te Cross and Transport to the Tomb! Is it having a hard time for Colin ‘thinking’ a long narrow zigzag patterned winding sheet or himation/sindon might well have been used as an inner winding burial sheet along with several additional shrouds to tightly wrap up the TS man’s body in dignity? Reminder for him: to Judeans the zigzag weave pattern was symbolic of the living waters of the Torah and do fit well into… the (archaeological) picture.

Since most likely it is Yeshua’s, it should be the natural end product of a mechanical chemical interaction between his corpse and burial cloth as the former most likely was heavy sweat residue and Judean desert dust covered and in freshly dried blood; the latter in soaked with alkaline waters to purify his shed innocent blood and kill flesh flies’ larvae and blow flies’ eggs. Reminder: Yeshua’s buriers thought him innocent of the crimes for which he was sentenced to death and his corpse had remained in the open for at least an hour an hour and a half. Adhesion of water insoluble (e.g. Iron oxyde and/or other “opaques” present in the desert of Judea dust) onto the body skin and/or receiving flax surface could have resulted from the Sharaf (the biblical Ru Ha Qâdim or East Wind), an Israel wind more commonly known as Khamsin or the Dark Breath of the desert of Judea. See also 3/1twill weave linen fabric return force and the effect of alkali pre treatment on mechanical and morphological properties of flax. First the long inner burial cloth soaked in (warm?) alkaline solution (ashes of the Red Heifer and/or malky stone or/and Jerusalem malky stone –– specific Jerusalem limestone –– dust, mixed with water) is held taut – by two buriers – on two raised stones (most likely) respectively placed at head and foot of an unction slab. The disposition of the cloth at the time of the image formation implies, on one side of the slab, a third burier holding two canes previously inserted widthwise through the ease horizontal S fold made in the middle of the half bottom of the long inner burial cloth held taut (i.e. At the buttock level, see Thierry Castex’s figure 4 – 3 D Dorsal View of the Front Side) in order for the stiff rigid corpse handling, wrapping and binding to be correctly performed in extra height. Then the body –– carried by two or three other buriers –– is carefully laid out on the half bottom of the cloth kept taut (in extra height), by the other side of the slab. Reminder: a stiff rigid body does behave like a wooden board (board like stiffness) and the TS man’s corpse was all in (freshly) dried blood, which explains the absence of any smearing on the cloth. As the bottom half of the long burial sheet is pulled rigidly tight and the body laid on it and the two stones, fresh antiseptic insect repellent aromatic flora (Gr. Aromaton) and solid objects such as a cane of Arundo donax, a cord or rope etc are laid alongside the body with a few items such as a cord or rope, cane etc. (+ symbolic & affective tokens laid on top?). Two wooden pieces (sawn off the Yeshua’s trilingual titulus damnationis to make a small ‘jawbox’: a wooden piece is stuck on both sides of the bent forward head, between cheeks and dried blood, sweat and dust pasted long hair side strands hard like cardboard. Then the top half of the long burial sheet is tautly wrapped lengthwise over the body from head to toe. A shorter burial sheet (about 2m long and 1m wide) is transversely tightly wrapped around the moistened long inner burial sheet to close the stiff rigid body at the torso level and counteract dislocated arms rigor mortis. Two (alkaline water in soaked?) long linen strips/thin bandages are then used to bind the corpse widthwise from shoulders to feet in order to keep the Sindon close around the torso and legs. A small veil of fine transparent byssus is placed over the enshrouded face; a third shorter wooden piece sawn off the titulus damnationis is stuck under the enshrouded chin and between the two enshrouded lateral wooden piece ends and a skull cap is fastened on top of it all to keep the deceased’s mouth close and the Sindon close around the head. (This can be deduced from the Greek conjugated verbs used in the Gospels to describe Yeshua’s burial, the Turin Sindon’s absence of lateral body image; Israeli botanist, Avinoam Danin’s, Italian paleographer, Aldo Marastoni’s, French optic engineer, late André Marion’s findings and my personal and other researchers’ thorough examinations of additional possibly genuine contact Christic relics kept in Germany, Italy and France). Reminder: Read in the light of the Turin Sindon, the Gospels implies the lengthy linen cloth (Heb. Sadin, sovev), was first tautly wrapped (Gr. Enetulixen, Matthew 27,59) lengthwise around the stiff rigid body in dried blood and the latter thus wrapped to be then compressed (Gr. Eneilesen, Mark 15,46) and fastened (Gr. Edesan, John 19,40) width wise with spices (Gr. Aromaton). This implies the corpse was subjected to a purifying and drying out ancient Judean ritual in the shape of small scale myrrhic aloetic fumigation (burning an aromatic plant/resin and wood on activated charcoal; see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum) and at least an incense pan to hold burning charcoal was used. This is totally consistent with the evidence that supports a low temperature image colour formation process. The Sindon image is affected by several distortions strongly suggestive of rigor mortis such as back curved, head slightly bent forward, legs bent with raised knees and elongated arms and fingers on the right hand. The unusually long arms and seemingly long fingers on the right hand imply both dislocation and uneven stretching at the arm level. The uneven recording of the two arms on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from abduction to adduction thus creating sort of a counter pressure to wrapping up pressure. Through drying out and cloth to body pressure release, the arms mechanically tended to slightly raise again, this resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint. The particular distortions here are a matter of “complex variable projective geometry” as the long inner burial cloth shrank up and got somehow taut again – during the Sindon image formation process – in conjunction with abducted adducted arms counteracted rigor mortis. Most likely (this can be deduced from the Sindon image characteristics): –The ease horizontal S fold made in the middle of the half bottom of the long inner burial cloth allowed two canes to be transversally inserted through the double tube at the buttock level in order to help correctly wrap the body resting in extra height on the two raised stones in the antechamber. Once the corpse was tightly wrapped up, the pair of canes could have helped carry the body down from the antechamber to the burial chamber and have it rest first on one and then the other side on two piles of granulized myrrh on the tomb bench in order to be subjected to a myrrhic aloetic fumigation. Once the linen dried out, the canes were removed and the body placed in supine position inside the sole funerary vaulted niche (Heb. Kokha) on a bed of granulized myrrh (blended myrrh and aloes?) to keep it from putrefying and the burial cave entrance sealed by a large stone disc. In anticipation of honorary visits, his linen wrappings were to be anointed with the perfumed spicy oils the women had prepared immediately after the Sabbath and brought at the first hour of the first day of the Judean week (Sunday) to prevent the stench of his decomposing corpse (However the anointing was not done as they found the tomb empty of Yeshua’s body on that very day). –The body image only affected a superficial thin layer of impurities (a mere 0.0002 0.0006 of a millimetre thick, as thin as the wall of a soap bubble) made of starch, lignin, pectin, saponin, hemicellulose deposits and/or flax wax i.e. A layer of adhering carbohydrate (acquired adventitiously, e.g. In linen weaving and manufacture) that is not cellulose, but something chemically more reactive, more prone to dehydration as the heat evaporated the moisture on the cloth, drawing the dissolved solids outwards. –Prior to being laid in supine position on the tomb bench, the stiff rigid corpse –– tightly wrapped up both length and width wise in linen –– resting in extra height on two granulized myrrh piles, was left to dry out first on its left and then right side when the image formation process occurred. His blood and body image were recorded on the burial cloth inner side along with a much fainter corresponding blood and facial hair image (beard, moustache and part of long hair) on its external side. –Both bloodstains and body frontal and dorsal imprints come from direct contact and gradual loss of direct contact transfer from the body to the cloth implying, as a mechanical chemical model, the tightly wrapped up corpse was basically anaerobic (with no air gap), front and back and while drying out and shrinking close to the skin, water mechanically entrapped in the void spaces among the flax fibres of the in soaked 3/1twill weave linen cloth, evaporated while compressed involving conducted heat through almost atom to atom contact as the lengthy inner burial sheet mechanically got somehow taut again. –The “opaques’ present in the Judean desert dust or/and Jerusalem malky stone dust allowed collimation as the concentration evaporation could have catalyzed the dehydrative oxidation of the cellulose; dissolved the adhered powder and coloured the long inner burial sheet, front and back, according to the body front and back ‘valley hollows’ and ‘hill tops’. –The oxidation, dehydration and conjugation of a layer of adhering carbohydrate/“collimated/auto regulated vaporographic mordanting process” of the thin impurity layer results from first maximal cloth/body direct contact with a corpse (still in hyperthermia at 41 42°C as a crucifixion victim’s body is most likely to overheat?) tightly wrapped up in dry outer linen and a pre soaked interior lengthy linen shroud, which, once subjected to a myrrhic aloetic fumigation and under pressure release of the lengthy inner burial wrapping, has then gradually lost intimate contact through evaporation and shrinking, thus creating sort of a tight protective seal (much akin to shrink wrap) over the stiff rigid corpse (as the long inner burial sheet gradually unstuck from body skin and got somehow taut again hence the high (undisturbed) quality of the bloodstains (who are mainly mirror images of freshly dried blood clots that were remoistened to stain the cloth). The in soaked compressed lengthy inner burial cloth was first touching most if not all body ‘valleys’ and ‘hills’ of the contours of the body, both front and back, then only the body ‘hill tops’, front and back, as it dried out and shrank and the shorter outer burial sheet and the linen strips/thin bandages, wrapped widthways across the body, stretched. To the sole exception of lateral macro and micro air pockets (and next to no fontal and dorsal ones), the absence of body skin to cloth front and back air gap prevented the ‘opaques’ (present in the Judean desert and the malky stone dusts) being deflected by air molecules somehow created a molecular beam. –In this burial reconstruction, the Maillard reaction has nothing to do with the TS man’s image formation process. The appearance of the decomposition amines (that would otherwise have slowly appeared at the surface of the skin under normal circumstances during the time in the tomb) was temporarily delayed/suspended through a specific ancient Judean purifying and drying out ritual that was performed about two hours after the Turin Sindon man’s death and resulted in something like ‘shrink wrapping’.

The true fact is placing coins over the deceased’s eyes as a Second Temple period/1st century CE CURRENT/DAILY PRACTICE is myth. However, the numismatic archaeological finds in Second Temple tombs just cannot TOTALLY RULED OUT a MOST SPORADIC PRACTICE of placing either a coin between the teeth/on the tongue OR over each eyes. 1/Is it “impossible” for coins to fall down into the mouth of an undamaged skull? So far as the archaeological record is concerned, only four small bronze coins (or prutot in Hebrew, dilepta in Greek) were retrieved inside three different skulls (one damaged, two undamaged) excavated from Judean tombs of the Second Temple period. Because all the coins were found in the oral cavity, those inside the two intact skulls were explained as coins “unequivocally” placed in the mouth and very rare manifestations of a pagan influence on Judean burial customs associated with Charon’s obol (or payment required by the ferryman Charon to reach the mythical underworld). Now it has been demonstrated experimentally a prutah or dilepton type coin, placed over the eye of a deceased lying in a supine position with his head held upright (as if on a headstone or head rest) or tilted forward (as if on a pillow), may drop through the lower fissure in the back of the eye socket and fall into the mouth, by a “piggybank effect”, as the body decays. It may also happen with a coin placed over both eyes. Although arch sceptics dismiss the coin on eye theory in connection with these finds, at close examination, in the context of a Judean burial of the Second Temple period, the Charon’s obol theory is a most unconvincing explanation as it creates more questions than answers and has a potential to mislead. For instance, in the Jericho D/18 tomb case, why exactly a Judean burier or mourner would have felt the need to place two coins instead of only one in the deceased’s mouth as Charon’s obol? Would the two coins have been intended for a return trip? In the Caiaphas’ daughter’s intact skull case, why exactly would a high priest family of Jerusalem have felt the need to recur to the pagan custom to bury one of its deceased members? It actually verges on sheer anachronism. Therefore, it would be good archaeology to integrate the forensic datum to reassess past findings and keep an open mind for the coin on eye issue in connection with the Turin Shroud. Reminder 1: More than thirty Pilate coins were found in 1st century CE cave tombs through Israel. Reminder 2: An erroneous numismatic theory crept into Shroud literature.

Is the Turin Shroud the crux literaria of the Constantinople Sindon? Suffice it to syntactically piece together several corroborating 944 1207 CE testimonies and eyewitness descriptions, from Gregory Referendarius’ (Archdeacon of Hagia Sophia), to Nicholas Mesarites’ (overseer of the treasuries in the Pharos Chapel of the Boucoleon Palace of the emperors) via Robert de Clari’s (Fourth Crusade Picard knight), and a few others, to build a strong if not crucial evidence the Turin Shroud (TS hereafter) and Constantinople Sindon (CS hereafter) could be one and the same object. The literary synthesis reads: “[In the church of My Lady Saint Mary of the Pharos (“lighthouse”) in the Golden Imperial Palace of the Boucoleon in Constantinople and another church called My Lady Saint Mary of Blachernae], Christ ‘rise[d] again’ [then], and the sindon(1) with the burial linens [was] the clear proof. [This sindon] as white as snow from antiquity, [was] of linen, of easily obtainable material, remained uncorrupted and smell[ed] fragrant of myrrh. [It] def[ied] decay because, after the Passion, it [had] wrapped the elusive(2) dead naked body. [When] raised upright, not only the image of the glorious features of the Saviour’s face with dripping drops of blood shine[d] out but also the form and most noble stature of his entire body hanging down from the cross and embellished with drops of blood and water that make the liquid flow from his own side, could be plainly seen. This [was] not the art of the painter and the various beautiful colours, which provide a door for the mind to consider the original and depict images [that could possibly have depicted] the reflection of his appearance and size imprinted on [his sindon]. [So much so] the ‘not made by hand’ image of Christ and G od, draped with a white/pure linen cloth he had worn, was sufficiently in lieu of the vision of the Lord coming into the flesh to those who had not corporally seen him. After the city was taken, the French partitioned the relics of the saints and the most sacred of all, the sindon in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before his resurrection. We know the sacred sindon in Athens. [In this city] we saw with our own eyes the burial linen cloths found in the sepulchre.” This is strong historical evidence indeed and tends to prove the presence of the most famous contact and blood relic of Christianity at Constantinople prior to 1204. Notes: (1). – Also called sydoine and synne1 in old French; the latter for “sign” (Latin signum; Greek symbulos). (2). – Greek aperilepton, i.e. Consistent both on one hand with G od’s “un circumscribed”, non coercive and loving, divine nature that has no shapes, is beyond description and the binds of Death cannot contain and, on the other hand, Yeshua’s “un outlined”, evanescent nature of his own image on his sindon..","date":"2014-07-29","mins":"3:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"id":"comment-141012","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Re 1300 1357 CE written records: A Templar named Sabatier did talk about a long piece of linen cloth he venerated.

Re frequency of displays: As a fair estimate, most likely one hundred to one hundred and fifty public bare hand held displays took place from 1355 to 1842 and almost as many private displays. Is that what you implied by your phrase “paucity of displays”? Are you kidding? Re ‘threadbareness’, you wrote « I do not consider ‘sharp fingernail pressure (per cm2)’ an avenue worth pursuing ». Unless you also consider in general neither Archbishops nor Bishops nor prelates have fingernails and the latter never could be sharp and could not exert any strong pressure per cm2 on the shroud totally unfolded and stretched for display and unless you consider Bishops’ and Archbishop rings were accident proof as far as shearing and thread tugging are concerned, methinks thread bareness and other damages to the outermost edge are most likely to happen in the very area the C14 sample was lift off. Actually the damage could have happened just underneath the seam beaded side strip as linen cloth that is repeatedly sharply bent because of finger grip begins breaking and tearing away from the seams. The very fact the two corners are missing can be seen as tell tale evidence per se (pun intended with French word “percé”). Reminder: according my reconstruction of the best way to hold the TS bare handed during an exposition so as to lessen the risk of cramps in the fingers and wrists, fingers DO grip the main body of a shroud replica as the seam is used for a better grip of the cloth, which implies strong and even very strong fingernail pressure per cm2 in the area under study especially with only two (see Lirey Shroud Pilgrim badge and Machy mold) or three prelates operating (see Turin Shroud public exposition iconography). Reminder (translation from French for Hugh): “In theory, an “invisible” restoration just cannot escape the counting glass, all the more so when the eye behind the binocular is competent. Photos that show P Rs Francesco Testore and Gabriel Vial († 2005) bustling around with various instruments, however, are a little misleading as they suggest that such experts were engaged in preliminary integrity checks of the said area when in fact their visual examinations under natural light were not extended to the heart of the sample but were confined to the sole edge of the sheet.” Unless you factually could account for the wide distribution of observed results (calendar years 1238 1407) on a small distance (just four centimeters of tissue), invisible repair and reweaving are most likely (without totally ruling out the additional impact of a Second Temple period purifying ritual). Now most likely the micro reconstructions were circumscribed to two very tiny damaged areas (less than one cm2 each) at the very core of the C14 sample. If were are to rely on the body of statistical, chemical, microscopic, historical and textile of evidence, a natural variant to French reweaving (« reweaving via splicing ») most likely was applied at least to one of the said tiny damaged areas..","date":"2014-05-23","mins":"5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"id":"comment-123609","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh wrote: “I do not believe it was made threadbare by handling.” Keep on “not believing”.

To Angel: The true fact is Pareidolia, Apophenia and Hierophany (PAH triad), as psychological phenomena, DID influence diverse cultures across the world. My personal research work and finds in archaeocryptology leads to me conclude that PAH seems to be present in the origin and/or development of the religions, Christianism INCLUDED. Its presence in a ‘sacred textile site’ such as the Turin Shroud can be traced up as early as about 1950 years ago (see e.g. Book of Revelation in the light of the TS + late antique Christian apocalyptic literature, Syriac secret liturgical rituals, late antique and medieval (pseudo )hierographic literature, the Grail medieval legend etc). More specifically, the second earliest ‘L’/‘Γ’ (gamma) like shaped marks, I came across in my research work, are to be found on several ancient Egyptian and Ethiopian Coptic domestic, garment and/or liturgical textiles. Greek capital letter gammas (mirrored and non mirrored) generally occur in pairs (front and back or top and bottom). The repeated motif as 4 gamma shaped patterns appears to have been at the same time both decorative and symbolic. Most likely, it does have a meaning as a reference to Yeshua’s burial winding sheet/garment 4 ‘L’/‘Γ’ shaped burn holes caused by incense grains and geometrically distributed on the famous burial cloth. Besides the ‘L’ and ‘Γ’ the ‘I’ also occurs as early as the 5th c. CE. Etc. Roman and Byzantine paintings and mosaics often include representations of decorated textiles with ‘clavi’ that can symbolically be equated with the TS 4 geometrical burn holes. Re gammadion (from Greek γαμμάδιον), in ancient Greek the word tetraskelion (Greek: τετρασκέλιον), literally meaning, “four legged”, is one of the other names for the shape.

At its simplest, it is the art of literally camouflaging (i.e. Hiding in full view via subtly equivocal signs translated and in translation for the beholder) visual (with or without textual) information within the structure of an apparently rather conventional and innocuous iconographic ‘cover’ (panel painting, sculpture, manuscript illumination, graffiti) so that outsiders are not aware of its very presence. Or to put it in other words and paraphrase Carvin, “it is simply a case of disguising a covert image within an overt one for the purposes of concealment”. Whereas more specifically, its Christian form is none other than the advanced crypto mnemonic Art of embedding the sacred image of Christ’s body image and blood on his burial winding sheet in an overtly conventional (or even overtly non conventional) biblical, New Testament and/or hagiographic scenic ‘cover’ for the Benedictine monk’s or nun’s eye well versed in ‘Histotheoria’ (interpretative image/text processing from material direct observation to spiritual teachings) to (discreetly/secretly) meditate at will on the Christian Mystagogic Image par excellence.

Now in the 14th c. CE, French was the international vehicular language of the Catholic world. “In 1328, the last of the Capetians (Charles IV) died without an heir. The King of England asserted his right to the throne, but the French princes preferred Philippe VI of Valois (1337). So it was that two French speaking kings struggled for control of the kingdom of France until 1453—the period known as the 100 Years’ War. This lengthy conflict weakened the French monarchy, which lost a number of provinces to England until the intervention of Constable Du Guesclin (1320–1380) under Charles V and later Joan of Arc (1412–1431) under Charles VII finally swung the advantage back to the King of France, who gradually retook Paris (1436), Normandy (1450), Guienne (1453), and other regions.” “In reaction against France, English replaced French at the Parliament of London in 1363. After the defeat of Agincourt (1415), the Treaty of Troyes (1420) recognized Henry V of England as the heir to the kingdom of France. He was the first king of England to use English in official documents, and he drew up his will in English. However, French continued to be the spoken language of the English court since most of England’s monarchs came from France.” (See http://www.slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=french history) So recurring to the English appellation “The Holy Grail” to code (in English) “Lirey Toga” doesn’t make sense here at all since the appellation known by the French and English elite was first and foremost that of “Li Saint Graal” of which anagram just cannot be “The Lirey Toga”!.","date":"2014-10-20","mins":"11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/19/new-paper-the-lirey-toga/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"New Paper:  The Lirey Toga"},{"id":"comment-168868","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"This is NO coincidence at all!.","date":"2014-11-05","mins":"6:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/decrypted-iconosteganalysist-or-iconocryptanalyst/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Decrypted:  Iconosteganalysist or Iconocryptanalyst"},{"id":"comment-164062","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder: the old French word ‘grail’ translates “(diamond shaped) metallic trellice”.

In Luke 20:22, Sanhedrin hired “spies” were sent to Yeshua. Their mission was to seize on Yeshua’s likely unguarded answer to their political and theological question (“Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?”) as a basis of handing him over to the Roman procurator on the charge that he taught the people not to pay tribute to Caesar. This would amount to a charge of seditious rebellion against Rome and would carry the death penalty. The denarius, which had a bust of Tiberius Caesar on it, was a relatively small silver coin issued from the imperial mint in Lyons by the command of Caesar himself. Its “superscription” read: “Tiberius Caesar Augustus, son of the divine Augustus.”The reverse of the coin had an image of the emperor’s mother, Julia Augusta (Livia), sitting on a throne holding a scepter in one hand and an olive branch in the other, and an inscription that read Pontifex Maximus, that is, “High Priest.” The denarius thus proclaimed the power and glory of Rome and the divine origin and character of Tiberius. Now all sacred taxes were to be paid in silver Tyrian currency not silver Roman dinarii with and image of Caesar. Besides the latter were not allowed to enter the Temple and were to be changed for Tyrian currency whereas the poll tax denarius was paid in silver Roman currency only to the Roman authorities via the Sadducean authorities. In Judea a Roman procurator took over control and was responsible for securing the taxes while the Sadducean authorities, whose loyalty was proved again and again, were his agents. So not only did they advocate the payment of the tribute, they were loyal agents in seeing that it was collected..","date":"2015-06-19","mins":"8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

Prior to Klausner, Jewish distinguished scholar Jacqueline Genôt Bismuth refer to Jesus of Nazareth as Yeshu’a Ha Notsry. The fact is, In the first c. CE, the name Yehoshua was abridged in Yeshu’a and Ha Notsary in Ha Nostry.
