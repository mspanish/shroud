What about the (real) possibility of the long inner shroud or sindon missing and Yeshua appearing not stark naked to Mary Magdalene but draped in it like a gardener (Reminder in the Second Temple period, a long sindon could be used as inner garment, indoor wear, spring/summer outdoorwear and… workwear).

Moreover the two words are used in a very specific context: that of the Empty Tomb scene, and, last but not least, the koine Greek the writer used in his gospel is NOT natural Greek at all but translation Greek from Hebrew/Aramaic. Now the Greek word OTHONIA can read as cryptic hermeneutical crux via wordplay on the Hebrew phrase OTH YONA, “SIGN OF JONAH”, in conjunction with the Empty Tomb scene. It echoes BOTH Jonas’s Prayer (Jon 2:1 3)– “Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his G.od from the belly of the she fish, and he said, “I called out from my limit for the LORD and he answered me; out of the Sheol (Abraham’s bosom) I called, my voice thou heardest” AND Matthew (Mat 12:40) – “For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” This is not just coincidental here. Besides the “Greek” word SOUDARION as the hellenisation of the Aramaic word SUDARA’ and his triliteral or triconsonantal root (Samekh Rosh Daleth) plays on the Hebrew/Aramaic word SEDER, “order, arrangement, and composition” in reference to the Passover Seder. It is also in Aramaic Syriac sidar, “he arranged” and Akkadian sadaru, “to put in order, to weave”. Therefore cryptically speaking, it evokes at one and the same time the large wrap rolled up onto itself and the Passover Seder in conjunction with the Hebrew Letter Samekh (literally “fish bone”, first letter of the Aramaic word sudara’). Reminder the Turin Shroud itself is a piece of HERRINGBONE patterned linen in a 3:1 twill weave. Finally, based on the Hebrew verbal root (Y Sh ‛Ah), the deceased’s Aramaic given name Yeshu‛a tells us about “[providential] salvation, deliverance, safety and… RESCUE” and back we are to Jonas’s story and Yeshua’s prophecy in Matthew 12:40….","date":"2013-10-15","mins":"10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later"},{"id":"comment-47564","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Sovev, sovev, “round and round….","date":"2013-10-15","mins":"10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/09/a-picture-worth-a-thousand-words-a-shroud-2000-years-later/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Picture Worth a Thousand Words:  A Shroud 2000 Years Later"},{"id":"comment-47572","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Coorection: nor the CAHORS HEADDRESS as burial SKULL CAP placed first in soaked with a watery solution right on the head then removed to be placed on top of the Turin face and underneath the skull cap.

So let me REALLY clear it up now I feel more rested. Reminder: as I am a non English speaking person, I had to go back practicing the English written language and actually have been practicing it thanks to Dan’s blog since late october 2011 (from the summer of 1994 summer to the autumn of 2011, I just wrote once in English in order to prepare a poster session to be presented in Frascati, Rome, Italy). Back to the issue. Re your opinion “it’s PERFECTLY CLEAR (my upper case) in all of them (the alternative translations) that the shroud was not to be exhibited as the true shroud” and again “But the fact that it was to be announced “alta et in intelligibile voce, omni fraude cessante, quod figuram … non ostendunt ut verum sudarium … sed tanquam figuram” CLEARLY SAYS (my upper cases) that it was not to be claimed to be the Shroud, whatever anyone’s beliefs.” Methinks actually you’re totally off the mark. Firstly, the Latin sentence is NOT clear at all per se as it can trigger two translations. It is most circumvolved nay deliberately ambiguous. The true fact (my correction) is it doesn’t say clearly whether this is not the true shroud nor this is a fake/forgery/hoax. Translation is neither revision nor correction. You shall stick to the way it is phrased no matter how circumvolved and ambiguous and, if need be, provide an alternative translation for the sake of intellectual honesty. Still with me that far? Besides if the Shroud had been CLEARLY VIEWED in June 1390 to be a painting/fake/hoax/forgery, could you then tell me/us why would Clement VII have allowed and even encouraged the Lirey Shroud to be displayed with an indulgence attached? This is not serious. Taking into account the intrinsic and extrinsic context namely Medieval Ecclesiastical prose per se + Pierre d’Arcis’s report + conflict of interest + the very fact the Lirey Shroud could be the Constantinople Shroud that was stolen by Crusaders during the 4th Crusade) now I ask you another question: Investigation made, had Clement VII really known the Lirey Shroud was the true Shroud of Christ, could the pope officially recognize the Lirey Shroud as the Shroud of Christ that was stolen during the 4th crusade of which the whole episode is one of the most shameful blots on church history? Could he have deliberately associated the Holy Relic with this shameful episode? He just couldn’t have, which DOES account for his/his official scribe most circumvolved and ambiguous prose. Finally I refer you to your own conclusion (proving my point). On October 23, 2014 at 12:46 pm, you wrote: “Oh, I quite agree. Neither the d’Arcis memorandum nor the (second and definite version, my comment added) Papal bull prove that the Shroud is not authentic, not even that their respective authors really thought it was not authentic.” All the ambiguity is encapsulated in the sentence written in Medieval Ecclesiastical Latin and in the formule omni faud cessante, “all misrepresentation ceasing” or “all misstatement ceasing” in other words “in all honesty”..","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty"},{"id":"comment-164963","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh you wrote: it’s perfectly clear in all of them that the shroud was not to be exhibited as the true shroud”.

Investigation made (most likely after he received the bishop of Troyes, Pierre d’Arcis’s memorandum), most strikingly, the Pope officially took a position clear and cut against the very bishop himself: he imposed him a ban of perpetual silence under a pain of excommunion. In order words Pierre d’Arcis was NO LONGER ALLOWED to claim the Lirey Shroud was a fake. Conversely, the Pope imposed the canons of Lirey to publicly announce on ostensions “(They) don’t show the figure or representation because it is the true Shroud of Christ but because the figure or representation which it carries is said to be that of Christ.” In other words the Lirey canons were not allowed to say the Lirey shroud was the true Shroud of Christ (whether de facto it was the true one or not) since, had they said it was the true one, it would have been very much detrimental to the pilgrimage to the (painted) Besancon Shroud. The formula omni fraude cessante, “all misrepresentation/fraudulent presentation ceasing” just means neither Pierre d’Arcis could claim the Lirey Shroud was a fake/”a painting on a table” nor the Lirey canons claim they were going to show what was the true Shroud of Christ ONLY the figure OR representation the Shroud carried that was said to be the Shroud of Christ. Da M’s position disqualifies him as so called ‘historian’ as he still relies on the first bull (based on Pierre d’Arcis report heavily tinged with conflict of interest) that shall not be held and (alike Ulysse Chevalier) keeps falsifying the second and definite Papal bull (final version CORRECTED once the investigation was made). Da M’s heavy misreading of the formula omni fraude cessante is ‘a fraud’ in itself as he totally overlooks both the intrinsic and extrinsic contexts. It shall be translated “all misrepresentation/misstatesment ceasing” since it simply applies to the correct way the Lirey Shroud shall be presented to the public/pilgrims not to the Lirey Shroud as forgery or fake! To unashamedly and wronly assert that the sentence “We don’t show the figure or representation because it is the true Shroud of Christ but because the figure or representation which it carries is said to be that of Christ” means the Shroud is clearly a fraud is a linguistic and intellectual fraud (une imposture)!

Actually was is mostly needed is an alkaline solution in terms of remoistened human lactic acid and/or Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with rainwater and/or Red Heifer ashes mixed with living waters + (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation = pre or light mordanting conditions on Second Temple period burial (basic archeological chemistry).

The buriers had temporarily to make up for the latter and thus recurred to a (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation of the body/corpse to prevent bad odors on subsequent visits to the deceased in the three or seven days that followed his death (Second Temple period custom). Besides in the OT (“shall I repeat it endlessly” indeed!), fumigation/burning aromatic woods/spices to prevent dead body bad odors or euphemistically put it “honour the deceased” are reported in ancient Jewish/Judean funerary rites see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum.

Although he knew that Jesus was innocent he could not go against the wishes of fellow members of the Sanhedrin, who had Jesus executed as a criminal. The least he could do,therefore, was to arrange a tomb and burial cloth.” In 1998 in Turin I presented a paper demonstrating via mostly Hebrew time markers (translation entropy from Hebrew to koine Greek) + posts in this very blog, indeed there was time enough (two hours to two hours and a half) for 5 6 buriers (Yeshua’s Jerusalem secret disciples among whom Joseph and Nicodemus) to perform all the core procedures (substituting myrrhic aloetic fumigation to anointing procedure for lack of spicy perfume oil) applied to Yeshua’s bloodied body.

No matter how clever or cheeky Dayvault’s idea may seem at first sight, his forensic demonstration is far from being convincing as it falls short of both really extrinsic and intrinsic objective verifications. Firstly a more “eido(mosaico)matic” tile by tile minute detection, isolation, identification and back and forth gradual construction deconstruction process from source object’s accidental characteristics (i.e. Those of the TS face) to target object artificial characteristics (i.e. Those of the Sistine chapel fresco portion) should have been visually stressed to allow the reader to more easily follow and evaluate the relevance/accuracy of Dayvault’s observations. Secondly the latter’s so called ‘forensic demonstration’ falls short of overlaid counter examples that could have proved whether or not beyond the shadow of a rational doubt (rather/perfectly) similar matches JUST COULD NOT be arrived at through applying the same forensic methodology e.g. To “continuous directional derivatives” (or CD Ds) of Michelangelo’s, Leonardo da Vinci’s, Raphael’s, Albert Durer’s, The Joconde’s and Manoppello Veil/Veronica’s face image. Thirdly, beside 1991 Whanger CDD Sindon face photograph, 2 3 additional “Sindon face windows to look through” (make specific comparisons with) would have been most needed in terms of really building up a truly compelling forensic AND archaeocryptological case here. In spite of his 15 page paper piling up of tiny pieces of evidence, with respect, Dayvault never really builds into asolid, thorough and compelling scientific and archaeological crucial evidence. His methodology is flawed and more ad hoc imagery would also be needed for Dayvault to really drive his point home i.e. In his readership’s mind. This is rendered all the more difficult by Dayvault candidly asking his reader to believe Michelangelo encoded the Sindon face image in the Sistine church ceiling without even being aware of it. Hence one may suggest a better title for his paper: Michelangelo, “an iconocryptographer in spite of himself”?.","date":"2012-11-05","mins":"7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-20910","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: advance.","date":"2012-12-21","mins":"10:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/20/endowed-by-their-maker-with-dim-wits/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Endowed by their maker with dim wits"},{"id":"comment-18810","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: with respect, Dayvault never really builds IT into a solid, thorough and compelling scientific and archaeological crucial evidence..","date":"2012-11-05","mins":"7:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-18829","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"+ typo: with respect, Dayvault never really builds IT into solid, thorough and compelling scientific and archaeological crucial evidence..","date":"2012-11-05","mins":"9:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-18822","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"As a really impressive image misperception, see “The face of Jesus Christ seen in a cloud” by Rex Features in “The Telegraph”...","date":"2012-11-05","mins":"6:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-18823","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"See also Toby Elles (from Lancaster)’s frying pan with an image of “Jesus Christ” on it, Etc..","date":"2012-11-05","mins":"6:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-18825","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"“The face of Jesus” on a naan bread is OK too (see Picture: SWNS).","date":"2012-11-05","mins":"6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-18826","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"“The face of Jesus” spotted in April 2011 in a three cheese pizza at the Posh Pizza shop in Brisbane, Australia, even/oven shows “a non inverted 3”!.","date":"2012-11-05","mins":"6:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-18911","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"A valid way to really identify ‘TS MV face images’ in artworks or items such as the Justinian II solidus (there are only 9mm from hair top to pointed beard) is from at least 3 copied/interpreted TS MV facial accidental characteristics + at least 3 copied facial non accidental idividual characteristics.

The two initial letters for Salvator Mundi, SM, might well also allude to the Sindone Munda (see Matth. XXVII, 59 : « Et accepte corpore, Joseph involvit illud in sindone munda. »). Besides, the Constantinopolis Holy Mandilyon, as a “monstrance”, had a large central pearled oculus made of a rock crystal for beholders to see the Holy Face through it (“and the rock was Christ”). It might well mean “seen/painted after the Face of the Sindone Munda”. I hope the information is useful and… crystal clear.

Actually, your chronic denial of any forms of washing (whether direct or indirect) of Yeshua’s body rests, first and foremost, on A DIE HARD RECEIVED IDEA namely Yeshua’s burial (which happened to fall on a Friday, Preparation Day on Nissan 14th) was mostly hasty (within half an hour or so) and consequently incomplete/interrupted to preserve the sanctity of the impending great Sabbath of Passover (as you imply). From which you still most SUBJECTIVELY infer the women who returned on the third day were to anoint AND wash his body. Actually there is a great deal more flexibility involved then just the ‘hard stop at astrophysical sundown view’. In the hypothesis the Shroud is Yeshua’s, the TRUE FACTS to be taken into account are: –By Judean tradition, Passover begins at twilight, the dividing line between Nissan 14 and 15, NOT at sunset. –Yeshua was not executed by the Judean Supreme Court/Sanhedrin but by the Roman state. Had the Sanhedrin executed him, no rites whatsoever should have been observed (Semahot II.6; b. Sanh. 63a). –Yeshua as a Sage was given an honorable burial by at least two of his secret disciples (all the more so because of the shedding of his innocent blood). –Because of Deuteronomy, Yeshua’s body was to be taken down the cross as soon as possible on Preparation Day which means Yosseph Ha Ramatayim JUST CANNOT have awaited sunset (i.e. 2:30 after Yeshua’s death) and, then and only then, attended to the business of Yeshua’s corpse (i.e. To have gone to Pilate’s to ask for the body, bought a burial cloth and taken Yeshua’s body down the cross). He attended to the business of his secret master’ corpse as soon as the latter died on the cross i.e. At the 9th hour (about 15:00). –By Judean tradition in the Land of Israel in the Second Temple period, the Sage buried in a cave tomb used to be visited during the three or seven days immediately following his death (in the Gospels the women were to anoint Yeshua’s linen wrappings with perfumed spicy oils to mask bad odors on honorary visits to the cave tomb on the third day NOT to handle and wash Yeshua’s naked body on that same day. –Because of the Oral Torah observance, the women were not allowed to prepare (more specifically to grind) spices on Sabbath. Had they prepare them beforehand, then and only then, they would have been allowed to anoint Yeshua’s linen wrappings even into the Sabbath (B. Shab. 23.5). –As the first star appeared in the sky, the buriers sealed the tomb entrance with a “rolling stone”. Micro traces of granulized myrrh were detected on the pre burial sudarium/soudâra — now kept in Oviedo, Spain, — left inside the sole funerary niche of Yeshua’s cave tomb. Had Yeshua’s been buried into the Sabbath, by the Oral Torah his buriers (a minimum of 4 to form a Holy Brotherhood) would have been allowed to proceed to the preliminary disposal of the body (including its anointing, washing and placing on sand, salt or myrrh) as it took precedence over celebration of the Sabbath (B. Shab. 23.5). Now putting these 7 Judean ethnic milieu and evangelical puzzle pieces together, one should be more than aware that Yeshua’s burial must have occurred within a 4:00 maximum time frame (i.e. Immediately after his death on the cross at the 9th hour to the apparition of 3rd star as the dividing time marker between Nissan 14th and 15th). There was no problem to duly complete the specific main burial procedures within a minimum time frame of 2:30 (see one of my previous posts on this blog). Hence to assert Yeshua’s burial main procedures were not duly completed on Preparation Day, Nissan 14th and his body was still to be washed and anointed on the third day so as to preserve the sanctity of the Sabbath (as you imply) is to be totally ignorant of the Hebrew time markers of the day, Judean ethnic milieu burial customs and practices and, last but not the least, Oral Torah.

And if “the closing verses of the gospel MAY (mine) indicate its final form was compiled by a Johannine school, probably at Ephesus”, this accounts for my “MOSTLY (that is “not totally”) IN HEBREW (besides a few Aramaisms).

Fr. Benoît’s opinion you reported via Green does prove only one thing: THEIR DEFINITELY BEING ignorant in such matters. “Your” blindfolded opinion, borrowed from your medical, historical and exegetical gurus, has you believe Yeshua’s burial was only a pre burial done within half an hour or so and the women had to return on the third day to complete it in terms of handling, anointing and washing his body. Shall I repeat here, in the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period, A QUICK BURIAL IS DEFINITELY NOT A QUICK INCOMPLETE BURIAL as you most subjectively/biasely imply in blatant contradiction with the Oral Torah. According to the oral Torah: “For all other [except his father or mother], he should HASTEN the burial and not make the funeral elaborate. […] In an emergency, however, or on Sabbath Eve […], he should HASTE the burial and not prolong the funeral.” [Semahot IX.9] Besides and curiously enough, you do seem not to make any difference between a maximum 0:30 and a minimum 2:30 time frame for Yeshua’s burial or, to put in other words, between a VERY HASTY and a SIMPLY HASTY burial. You also do seem to superbly ignore the fact that the preliminary disposal of the body (including its anointing, washing and placing on sand, salt or blended perfumes) took precedence over celebration of the Sabbath (B. Shab. 23.5). The very fact that YESHUA’S BURIAL SHOULD BE HASTENED DOESN’T IMPLY AT ALL the core procedures were not done (included washing and purification). Actually, true Shroud Science based on the Gospels, Hebrew Bible, Oral Torah, Judean burial customs & practices of the Second Temple period, pre 70 CE Judaism History, Philology, Archaeology, Archaeoastronomy does point in one direction, with nothing (or next to nothing) to suggest the contrary: Yeshua’s burial was completed (to the sole technical exception of the custom of anointing his linen wrappings). (In all likelihood, pre burial linen napkins or strips were used to clean Yeshua’s face and body. In the light of the fresh looking neat wound blood decals on the Shroud, it appears that the linen napkins or strips should have simply been placed on the face and whole body to absorb the blood as much as possible, but not used in any kind of wiping movement. This simplified yet careful washing might well have been completed by purification namely the use of the water/watery solution soaked inner shroud made naturally soapy to purify Yeshua’s shed innocent blood and keep it with his body through rapid drying up (namely subjection of the tightly fastened body to myrrhic aloetic/aloetic fumigation). This specific simplified washing via linen napkins or strips and purification via the inner shroud just made soapy (with the water of the Red Heiffer?) and subsequent rapid drying up through fumigation could well account for possible micro traces of Jerusalem malky stone dust to be still detected on the shroud in the foot sole/knee/nose/ areas)..","date":"2012-03-28","mins":"1:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-22149","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"BTW Matthew was a Levy and Yo Hanan/John a priest….","date":"2013-01-16","mins":"5:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-22151","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"…and Peter as a fisherman from Galilee spoke Galilean Aramaic…..","date":"2013-01-16","mins":"5:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-22150","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Yair/Luke might well have been a chief ruler of a synagogue….","date":"2013-01-16","mins":"5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-22164","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder for Hugh: Hebrew was currently used by Levys/priests in Second Temple period Jerusalem.

The Shroud thread count is 38 lengthwise (warp) threads of 0.14mm in average diameter and 26 widthwise (weft) threads of 0.25mm in average diameter woven into a measured one centimeter square of the shroud fabric6. The 0.5cm Shroud body image resolution limit should not be mistaken for the 0.5mm Shroud blood imprint resolution limit that is also the visual resolution limit. Now – and contrary to the body image – it should be here emphasized that the intriguing faint and very tiny faint brown letter grouping like patterns on the right eye area do appear photographically positive like the blood stains on the linen cloth. If we apply the Occam razor principle (i.e. If we try to give the simplest explanation to account for sharply defined appearance of the very tiny impressions), in the light of a funeral custom, it might well be the kind of incomplete decal or tell tale sign a coin manipulated with blood stained fingertips and placed over the right eyelid of the deceased is expected to leave on the internal upper side of a shroud soaked with a watery solution and pressed to the face. This has been demonstrated by experiments [Rodante’s and Moroni’s]7 (see figure 6) and just bypasses the theoretical objection that the threads would be too large to show this type of faint brown tiny letters on the Shroud face image.” Most likely, the Pilate coin obverse partial tiny imprints are bloodstain patterns (see 2002 Durante digital authentic or second generation copy on paper of the Turin Shroud face).

The doubt in regard to what is here really meant is as old as Chrysostom. The latter says, (Horn. X. On this epistle) “that the word (phailonen) denotes a garment (to himation = a very large rectangle of fabric that can be draped as a shawl, a cloak, or a head covering)”. The philological fact is the word can read as a reference to a very large wrap, wrapping fabric or wrapper. Now the Greek Word φαιλόνην (phailonen) is derived from the ancient Greek word phaos, “to shine”, “give light” (e.g. A heavenly light such as surrounds angels when they appear on earth) or “make manifest”. Thus philologically speaking, the word phailonen most accurately denotes “a very large wrap that shines and/or makes manifest (through a porthole in the middle?)” and can refer to the TS shroud as a 4.44m long and 1.13m wide sindon/himation in which shines (in full daylight or natural transmitted light) the crucifixion victim’s bloody body (or just face?) image as visual epitome of the Gospels.

To claim to the contrary is BAD archaeology. How long shall I have still to DE poison the well? Several 1st c. CE tombs yielded 46 (forty six) Pilate coins throughout the Land of Israel. Hence archaeologically speaking and no matter how sporadically, Roman Procurators coins, among which mostly Pilate coins were used on Second Temple period burial practices (unless Dan anachronologically thinks alike Joe Zias, an anthropologist –not an archaeologist!–, ALL the Pilate coins found in STP tombs ‘simply fell out of the POCKETS(sic!) (upper cases mine) of the STP buriers or mourners. The numismatic archaeological finds in Second Temple tombs just cannot any longer be denied (see L.Y.RAHMANI, “Jason’s Tomb”, Israel Exploration Journal 17(1967) 100 and L.Y.RAHMANI, A Catalogue of Jewish Ossuaries. Re his totally biased (and agenda driven) opinion/reliability on the TS coin on eye issue, in 1980, Rahmani stated “No coins of the period 50 BC to 70 AD were found in any tomb” while, in 1956, Jason’s Tomb (excavated by Prof. Rahmani himself!), yielded no less than 55 coins among which 28 Pilate coins (both lepton simpulum and dilepton littus types). This is not serious!) Besides thanatologically speaking, they could have been placed over the eyes of the TS man. Indeed it has been demonstrated experimentally a prutah or dilepton type coin (i.e. A thin small coin), placed over the eye of a deceased lying in a supine position with his head held upright (as if on a headstone or head rest) or tilted forward (as if on a pillow), by a “piggybank effect” may drop through the lower fissure in the back of the eye socket and fall into the mouth, as the body decays. It may also happen with a coin placed over both eyes. Still the fact remains though the very partial Pilate coin tiny patterns haven’t been correctly/convincingly extracted so far from the linen cloth pattern in which they are unfortunately embedded (eidomatically and numismatically speaking and in conjunction with archaeological bloodstain pattern analysis/cryptanalysis, markings –no matter how incomplete left by Pilate coin obverses can be seen on the TS man’s eyelid areas. Hope I’ll finally publish a research paper I wrote in 2011 CE demonstrating beyond the shadow of a rational doubt the very partial Pilate coin obverse impressions are really there). Reminder one for Dan: one American professional numismatist and two scholar numismatists and Jewish ancient coin experts did identify the partial imprint of a Pilate coin (dilepton lituus type) on the TS man’s right eye. Is Dan a Jewish ancient coin expert and/or an eidomatic numismatic/archaeological bloodstain pattern analyst or cryptanalyst? He definitely is not. Reminder two for Dan: Both ‘I think I sees’ (or false positives) and ‘I think I don’t sees’ (or false negatives) just cannot make up for the real thing. Reminde three, on March 19, 2014 at 9:00 am, I wrote: “Most likely too Pilate coins were used in Second Temple period funerary practices. All the more so as, symbolically speaking, Pilate coin central devices were specifically designed (or ambivalent enough as ‘aniconic designs’) to agree with both 1st c CE Judean and Roman sensibilities and be used by Judeans on an everyday basis. The fact is aniconic lepta and dilepta were allowed in the Jerusalem Temple treasure chamber (re read Mark and the ‘widow’s mite/Pilate coin episode’). Had Pilate coins feature really offensive central devices, they just could not have been used by Judeans, which is not the case. Archaeologically speaking, Pilate coins were used in Second Temple period/1st c. CE funerary practices too (nearly a dozen of Jewish tombs yielded 46 Pilate coins both dilepta (lituus type) and lepta (simpulum type). That’s a fact unless like Zias you think all the Pilate coins found in STP tombs ‘simply fell out of the pockets (sic!)of those visiting or preparing the tomb'(dixit). If so in the Jason’s Tomb for instance (Greenhut’s reference), they were many to have a hole in ‘their pockets’ and to lose Pilate coins since, in 1956, it yieded more than 55 coins among which no less than 28 Pilate coins (at the feet and nearby the body remains). Sporadic Second Temple funerary practices have not been convincingly cleared up yet (see Greenhut). Placement of Roman aniconic coins over the deceased’s eyes (no matter how sporadic) just cannot thus be totally excluded in the state of our knowledge of 1st c. CE Jewish burials. The fact remains 59 coins of “Roman procurators” + 12 “Roman” coins were found inside a dozen of Second Temple period tombs (the issue here is on coins found in SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD TOMBS untouched by robbers and still closed at the time of investigation (implied). More than half of the coins found are Pilate coins (augur wand and pail types). This speaks volumes re the use of Roman coins in Second Temple period funerary pratices. It was a Second Temple period sporadic funerary pratice at worse, yet a funerary practice all the same.Besides Roman coins, Herodian coins too shall be taken into account, which involved 27 Second Temple period tombs (hence more than two dozens) and 124 coins in all (in 2005) thus more than 10 dozens of coins. Methinks they might well be only the tip of the Second Temple period funerary monetary iceberg respective of the percentage of coins inside tombs that were undiscovered, or else disappeared with time and given the fact only 8 9 hundreds of Second Temple period TOMBS were excavated so far. The body image resolution is 0.5cm while the blood image (and thus any blood smeared object images) resolution is 0.4 0.5mm. Experimentally, Moroni, Rodante and myself could record Pilate coin or one Euro cent coin tiny characters on a 3/1 twill fabric providing the coin is partially smearded with blood. This is an experimental fact. My (archaeo)cryptological theory: Yosseph Ha Ramathaym/Yossef Bar Naba could have placed himself the coins over Yeshua’s eyes on burial as the very name Yossef was given to the eldest son/disciple (Ben = Tamid = Disciple in Hebrew)for him to close not only his father’s eyes but also his master’s (aka Yeshua Ha Nostry’s/Jesus of Nazareth’s). The placing of coins over Yeshua’s eyes had nothing to do with the Charon’s obol. Most likely it was both to keep his eyelids closed or to cover his still open/half open eyes AND to read as a silent/coin rebus like/coin puzzle like eulogy as eulogy was not allowed to be pronounced in the month of Nissan, the month in which Yeshua was put to death. According to Jewish traditional custom, the eulogy should not be PRONOUNCED to honour the departed during the entire month of Nisan. Hence recurring to a monetary rebus to silently honour the departed Rabbi is therefore a real possibility to finally account for the placement of coins over eyes in the Second Temple period. Most likely, the placement of coins over Yeshua as great Torah Scholar’s eyes was done with this kavannah, i.e. In this specific design. The word kavvanah (literally “direction”)refers to one ‘s state of mind/intention i.e. Concentration on the meaning of the words recited, the act performed (here silent eulogy), or the theological goal (such as the acceptance of the sovereignty of God). The placing of coins over the deceased eyes is sort of an original recycling/revisiting of the Hellenistic custom of placing a coin or two in the deceased’s mouth. Most likely, there were specific circumstances in which (rich?) Judean buriers or mourners recurred to placing coins over eyes not only to prevent the deceased’s eyelids to lift up or to hide his/her open/half open eyes but also to honour the deceased’s memory and abide by the Halakha(Judean religious law) when the eulogy was not allowed to be pronounced.

Etymologically speaking (scientific etymology) this is a Celtic name that literally means “he (the Virgo male) with a stag head” referring to a young man wearing a white stag mask with real antlers symbolic of Divine Power. In the feminine form, “she (the Virgin) of the stag headed (young virgo male)” symbolic of Materia Prima (the Human condition) in conjunction with a fecundation rite dedictated to Celtic G od Cernunos. Iconosteganlogically speaking, you can see the young stag head (as archaeoprareidolia /optical illusion) in the TS man’s bloodied image of his forearms. This TS steganic image accounts for the parallelled hagiographic legends of saint Stacey/cie, saint Julian and saint Hubert. Now: – the scientific etymology for Stacey/cie is Greek word eu stachys, “nice ear (of barley/wheat)” (and can be read in light of the TS weave pattern). All the more so as the latter surname plays with Greek word Anastasis, “Resurrection” too. – the surname Julian derives from the Greek word ioulos, “whole (ear of barley)”, which echoes Stacey/cie). – the scientific etymology for Hubert is ()possibly) Germanic hug, “thought, reflection, intellect” and bert, “to shine,enlighten, awaken”. The former copies the Aramaic word H Oug, “mental activity” and Chaldaic HâGo H, “to meditate, think, reflect, reason, deduce”. In Celtic houg/huw, “meditation, thought, inspiration”. All this speaks volumes on icono/cryptosteganology image and word interconnections. Then finally one can also notice the word brend (“antlers”) derived from the Celtic brand “to split (a host)”, “to divide (into TWO)”. The Celtic word comes from the Aramaic word P Ra D “to divide, split, share” (Heb. PâRa D). The latter plays with the Heb. Para ‘Aduma, ‘”the Red Heifer”, which plays in his turn with Heb.

The finger bones DO speak of thermal effect AND a tightly wrapped up bloody body.

The latter distortions are a matter of “complex variable projective geometry” as the in soaked long inner burial cloth (aka TS) shrank up and got somehow taut again – during the Sindon image formation process (through drying out when subjected to (myrrhic )aloetic fumigation)– in conjunction with abducted adducted arms counteracted rigor mortis. During the image formation process, the tightly pulled and compressed in soaked long inner burial sheet didn’t quite return to its natural size and shape as it got sort of taut again lengthwise through shrinking (through drying out). The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from abduction to adduction thus creating sort of a counter pressure to wrapping up pressure. Through drying out and slight cloth to body pressure release, the arms mechanically tended to slightly raised again, this resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint.”.","date":"2013-06-08","mins":"8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/05/r-i-p-ben-wiech/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"R.I.P.

It implies: – dust sweat and blood covered stiff rigid body ‘PRE WIPING’ (via post flogging cloth (Argentueil Tunic) and pre burial cloth (Sudarium of Oviedo)) – winding inner burial sheet (aka TS shroud) first in soaked with an AQUAEOUS ALKALI SOLUTION (ring any bell?) and then taut and manually molded/COMPRESSED (ring any bell?) lengthwise from head to toe and finally tighly wrapped up/COMPRESSED widthwise in a set of dry outer shorter shrouds (Veil of Manoppello, Cap of Cahors, Two Halves of the original Sindon Munda), all around the stiff rigid bloodied body (along with insect repellent flower heads, thorny plants to pin the inner and outer shrouds together and screening objects such as a small ‘jaw box’ made of three wooden plaques –see (copy of?) part of the Titulus Damnationis of Rome). – stiff rigid bloodied body placed in EXTRA HEIGHT (on two stones or piles of granulized myrrh bags) being tightly wrapped in shrouds and subjected to (myrrhic?) aloetic FUMIGATION (ring any bell?) first on one side and then on he other side – adhesion of water insoluble (e.g. Iron oxyde and/or other silica particles as ‘opaques’ present in the desert of Judea dust and Jerusalem limestone dust) onto the dried off urea residues and blood covered body skin and/or receiving flax surface to COLLIMATE the TS man’s image – GELATINIZED STARCH (at 55° 85°C) (ring any bell?) as extremely fine printing foaming agent and blood intensifier (monoxyde present in aloetic fumes can also ne a blod intensifier).

After a 15 30 minutes’ subjection to fumigation to purify and dry out the bloodied body (in the fumigated tomb antechamber), the linen held the bloodied body image through a providentially ‘built in’ pre or light mordanting process, which resulted in ventral and dorsal HD prints born on the inner side of the winding inner burial sheet (here linen with carbohydrate layer on it) – at least two cloth to body configurations in terms of COMPRESSURE (via tighlty wrapped up shrouds) and slight loss of COMPRESSURE (as the in soaked inner shroud aka TS got sort of taut again through shrinking and gradually unstuck) – AQUAEOUS ALKALI SOLUTION as pre or light mordanting agent since the warm/hot water solution used to soak the inner winding burail sheet in order to purify the bloodied corpse without disturbing the blood and wasting time, most likely was either the Red Heifer waters (in order to purify the TS man’s shed innocent blood along with his corpse), waters mixed with Jerusalem limestone/Melche stone dust (just to purify the bloodied corpse) or just remoistened urea residues (presence of ammonia) (A combination of waters mixed with ashes, limestone dust and ammonia cannot either be totally ruled out as far as aqueous alkaline solution is concerned) – use of an all wrapping sheet (Sudarum of Kornelimûnster) as ‘final touch’ prior to the body be carried down to the tomb chamber and laid suspine on a stone bench on granulized myrrh bags..","date":"2015-04-23","mins":"1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-197350","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"April 23, 2015 at 5:36 pm Reply Your comment is awaiting moderation.

Ever heard of the effect of alkali pre treatment on mechanical and morphological properties of flax? Ever heard of a compressed linen burial sheet in direct contact with a stiff rigid body and gradually getting taut again while shrinking and acting like a collimator? Ever heard of 3/1 twill weave linen fabric return force etc?).” “The lab chemist needs (absolute or relative) vaccum tubes to explain what archaeology can explain without… Lab/kitchen chemistry JUTS CANNOT explain all and be substituted to a multidisciplinary scientific/archeaological approach. I got a pretty good idea of what vaccuum means not only when I think of the void spaces present in the flax fibres but also when I read your eccentric pseudo scentific claim, you old mummy!” Colin said then (still on April, 2012 while he was promoting is scorch theory): “Because I omit to mention all YOUR DAFT IDEAS, MORDANTING INCLUDED (upper cases mine), having contented myself with “auto collimation etc” (…) that means this Biochemistry Ph D is ignorant of mordanting.” “For your information, I first encountered mordanting as a young teenager with a home chemical laboratory, a friendly local pharmacist who supplied me with virtually any chemical I asked for. I probably encountered mordanting as I worked my way through every fat textbook of descriptive chemistry in the local library – the kind they don’t write anymore – probably under the chapter headed “aluminium”, more specifically alum and aluminium oxy or hydroxyanions. ” Three years later (after he dropped his mummified monk skeleton/cadaver baking, template scorching and the like, “ (Colin) align(s) (him)self with Joseph Acetta … in thinking that THE TS IMAGE WAS PROBABLY DYED ONTO THE LINEN (upper cases mine), rather than heat scorched.

(Most likely this is not a dye stricto sensu, just pre or light mordanting of remoistened dried off urea residues and dried off or half dried off blood along with dust.) Still in his own blog, on April 17, 2012 (NOT 2015!) at 11:38 am, Colin also wrote: “I see you have set out your imaginary scenario for how the image was formed on Dan Porter’s site. As I suspected from your use of fanciful terms like “auto collimation” etc is absolute tripe from start to finish.” “Any kind of ‘vaporographic’ theory (BTW FUMES IS A SYNONYM FOR VAPOURS, comment mine), autoregulated or otherwise, would require a molecular beam, which in turn would require a collimator and a vacuum tube.

Because he’s neither a physicist nor an optical engineer or archaeological experimenter, he was then (in April 2012 CE) still unaware how ‘opaques’ (in terms of iron oxide and silica particles adhering to blood and in soaked long inner burial cloth) can be used as image collimating agents.

Alkaline water vapour concentration due to the resulting diffusion in relation to the dust covered bloodied body to cloth first absence of distance and then gradual distancing (at most a few millimetres from the body at points where image elements are now still visible beyond three paces), can have dissolved the adhered dust and via accumulated insoluble components (as enhancing agents) and gelatinized starch (as printing paste) collimated and mordanted the surface of the cloth according to a very small distance (in terms of a very small unsticking of just a few millimetres as the in soaked inner winding burial sheet got sort of taut again as it gradually shrunk front and back on drying out). The very presence of air gaps and/or screening objects and/or aromatic fresh flower heads and/or fresh flowering heads of spiny plants, prevented body image formation mostly on each side and incidentally on the epicranial interspace and neck areas, around the head and hands, at buttock and popliteal levels.

Not one of your previous twelve posts has come anything near to postulating a method whereby an “energy beam” is collimated by dust. We need better than cheap insults and Latin derivations. So come on, Max. Explain. I don’t believe you can.” First reminder for you: My archaeo(crypto)logy of the TS as textile artefact likely bearing the double image of a crucifixion victim who could be Yeshu’a does not rest on ‘fantasy’ as you mischievously/ misleadingly wrote but on: – My constant challenge not to reproduce ‘anti shroudies” and ‘shroudies” errors, – An excellent descriptive knowledge of the famous contact textile relic or substitute relic – An excellent (and at times ‘first hand’) descriptive knowledge of likely related christic textile and even wooden relics or substitute relics as well (Christolipsology). – Many a reliable iconographic and literary documents that pre dates –by one to nearly fourteen centuries– the TS official radiocarbon date (1325 ±65) (BTW a few of the documents were even unknown to you till I mentioned them in this very blog or are still unknown to you and the Shroud sphere) – Second Temple period history and Archaeology, Archaeoastronomy – Koine Greek Gospel accounts (+their Hebrew and Aramaic retroversions) + their translation entropy, Talmudic literature (mostly Mishnaic age 273 BCE–190 CE), Biblical literature, Patristics – Empirical facts that clearly demonstrate what the TS formation image process is not – Intuitive thought experiment (to bypass allegedly ‘archaeological’ and/or ‘scientific’ double bind experimental situations or allegedly ‘archaeological’ and/or ‘scientific’ double bind observations or interpretations) Now re my fumigation or vaporographic mordanting theory & your MISUNDERSTANDING (in terms of language and communication barriers): I STILL suspect (and your last comment says it all!) you (as high school teacher of the Science of the Earth and archsceptic ‘shroudie’) do not understand at all the thermal and textile physics and chemistry REALLY involved as far as the ARCHAEOLOGY of the TS image formation process is concerned. Most obviously and most unfortunately, you not only took at face value the few optical metaphors (bent & planar mirror, scan) I used but also mispresented a few of them (e.g. I never postulated “a method whereby an “energy beam” is collimated ONLY –my upper cases and addition– by dust” as you wrongly imply! Cannot you correctly read me? I actually referred to a DUST (urea residue) blood COVERED body like membrane shroud acting as a natural primary collimator in terms of accurate alignment AND image enhancer. You totally missed the implication (it makes a world of difference indeed)! (Second reminder for you: for the latter propriety of dust covered linen and contactless image transfer mechanism in a humid environment, see Bruno Azzola’s paper presented at the fourth Congresso Nazionale, Siracusa, Sicily, Italy in 1987. BTW that’s the third time I am referring you to the paper and most obviously you haven’t still read it yet before passing your most uninformed, misrepresenting and unsubstantiated negative comments!) How long will you misrepresent my ideas to overrate your allegedly ‘scientific’ opinion and underrate my archaeo(crypto)logical opinion in Dan’s blog? When was it last time you made an attempt to reconstruct the TS man’s dressing in shroud S to experimentally check out if his shroud(s) was/were not a genuine one/genuine ones or a fake/fakes? (I personally made two attempts in 1994 and 1997). What do you REALLY know about the mechanical return force exerted by textile structure in specific circumstances as described below?) In previous posts, in my haste (and admittedly tentative English) to explain (between two professional appointments!), I found it convenient to recur to the optical metaphor “bent & planar mirror”. The phrase (as you should have guessed!) does not refer to any ‘bent and planar mirror’ stricto sensu but the energy receiving re emitting textile surface in light of the body to cloth initial and final configurations! (And absent noteworthy exceptions) Indeed I integrated the likely fact that, first the cloth was tightly moulded around the body front and back and then sort of got taut again (through gradual shrinking and unsticking) from about 0.5mm to only a few millimetres’ distance just above the body. As to my use of the substantive “scan” and the phrase ‘energy beam’, they were for convenience too. The former was no reference at all to an ‘actual scan’ but to a superficial uniform front and back enhanced (3 D encoded/volumetric indeed) recording of the bloodied image onto the inner side textile surface on fumigation procedure! The latter (“energy beam”) most exactly referred to a collimated/ body shaped like vaporographic beam of energy resulting from fumigation of the alkaline water in soaked inner winding burial sheet (aka TS) moulded around the body front and back.

During experiments with a third scale replica of the escalator constructed at the UK’s Health and Safety Executive site at Buxton, a fire was lit and after seven and a half minutes of normal burning the flames lay down as in the computer simulation.The metal sides of the escalator served to contain the flames and direct the temperature ahead of the fire.When the treads of the escalator flashed over, the size of the fire increased dramatically and a sustained jet of flame was discharged from the escalator tunnel into the model ticket hall.

She couldn’t recognize her own master at first sight nor even ‘until he spoke’ (as you wrongly contend): she could recognize him ONLY when he called her by her name.

Until he appeared in his body and flesh to them, the disciples only thought their master’s body had been taken away and could not believed he had resurrected. Unless of course you imagine John and Lazarus ‘the resurrected’ were one and the same person, (which is quite possible as a Judean ‘coming back to life’ was and is still given today a new name) and the latter was ALSO the SOLE male EXCEPTION to the rule (then he would have hidden his true feeling to the other disciples) Saint Augustine’s, mine or Meacham’s reading of John 20:8 is most likely the good reading.

Mentioning chronology in the Gospels, could you give me the EXACT chronology of the events on that morning? Did Mary of Magdalene went only once or twice to Yeshua’s tomb? I wait for you… The literary fact is the women (i.e. Mary of Magdalene included) were FIRST told by Yeshua’s angels/messengers to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee and Mary of Magdalene (then alone) was told so A SECOND TIME by Yeshua alive in flesh and blood. You wrote: “I interpret the Greek as John at that precise moment of perception ‘believed’ Jesus had risen, not ‘KNEW’. He was not absolutely 100% sure, but believed so, from what he just witnessed, and notice also; he states only ‘he’ believed and not that ‘they’ believed, as in Peter believing so also!” First, can you tell me (from 20: 8) WHAT EXACTLY did John perceive’ (I’ll very much like you to tell me!) and what makes you so sure Saint Augustine, me and Meacham are “completely wrong” and cannot read properly? Second, you do tend to totally overlook or ignore this contextual metalinguistic/philological fact: the conjugated Greek verb for ‘he believed’ implies here John uses the Hebrew word ‘aman in the hiphil (verbal stem – causative) form of the verb for his original testimony in order to signify what he saw ‘caused him to be certain, sure’ or ‘to be certain about,’ ‘to be assured.’ Then he was certain about the fact the women had told them the truth. In this sense the word ‘aman in the hiphil conjugation implied in John 20: 8 shows that it is an assurance, a certainty, in contrast with the English verb ‘to believe’ in reference to something possible, hopefully true, but not certain. Now this ethnolinguistic fact is in rather curious contrast with your contention that “John at that precise moment of perception ‘believed’ Jesus had risen, not ‘KNEW’. He was not absolutely 100% sure, but believed so, from what he just witnessed.” You’d better do your linguistic/philological homework. Mentioning Early Christian history, how do you account for the early church NOT TO APPEAL to the testimony of the beloved disciple to the empty grave AS EVIDENCE of Yeshua’s resurrection in evangelistic preaching? The true fact is Peter and John went to Yeshua’s tomb JUST TO CHECK OUT what the women had just told them (‘they have taken the Master away’). Once inside the empty tomb, Peter was puzzled (not knowing what to really think about the missing body) while John no longer doubted what the women had told them was the plain truth. Had it been otherwise, the kerygma would have literally hinged around the empty tomb scene evidence. The true fact is the scene is… left behind. Yeshua “died… was buried… was raised… appeared…” Please do your early church historical and theological homework before indulging in wishful exegetical thinking… I could go on for hours and hours commenting on your overall wishful thinking here….","date":"2012-10-22","mins":"9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-18019","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Your pseudo traditional interpretation is not only speculative, it is contradicted by narratology, early Christian theology and history, the Gospel of the Hebrews (see Saint Jerome, common sense and Saint Augstine..","date":"2012-10-22","mins":"4:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-18035","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"…the whole irony of it is the Amarican Historian and Biblical exegete, Diana Fulbright (who talked on this blog about wishwul thinking),does read John 20: 8 (almost) like you….","date":"2012-10-22","mins":"10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-18037","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"There is so much dead wood to be cleared up in the forest of both Christian & Shroud Literature….","date":"2012-10-22","mins":"10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-18036","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"…and so do so many Christians..","date":"2012-10-22","mins":"10:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/16/the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-18038","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Since neither Yannick Clément nor Ron answer my questions, can any Christian scholar tell me exactly which burial clothes were ‘still present’ inside the empty tomb on Easter morning ?

Reminder for Louis: you keep asking others to behave and learn from their mistakes. What about you? Methinks carity begins at home! The fact is on July 1, 2015 at 3:43 am, I wrote (taking up the word “heavyweight” you applied to Fitzmyer and flung at me to underrate my own personnal opinion and Tresmontant’s): “Now alleged “Biblical scholar heavyweights” want us to believe the Book of Revelation was written in the 90s CE or even in the Second century CE! They are wrong. Most likely, it was written in 52 and/or 54 55 CE (see Tresmontant’s “L’Enquête”, 1994 CE)” Here the reply I got from you (a purple patch of most unkind and ungentlemanly ad hom indeed). “You will be laughed out of court if you try to challenge them (Biblcal scholars among whom Fitzmyer you look up as “a heavyweight”) with your interpretations, which will be dismissed as the result of feverish imagination” Louis, your “do as I say, not do as I do” stand is just beyond me (whence my highly unappreciated prompt answer)! This said, how can you tell for sure there is no apocalyptic dormant archaeoparadolias to be ‘woken up’ in light of the the Turin Sindon/Himation bearing the translucent imprint of a crucifixion victim bloodied body (most likely Yeshua’s)? How can you tell for sure it is just the result of my feverish imagination and not John’s psycho mystical feverish state at the time of his vision from/of Yeshu’a appearing to him in a garment (Gr himation = sindon) soaked/stained in blood? Methinks neither you (nor Fitzmyer) know what archaeperception or perceptive archaeology (the art of seeing what people from the past saw, whether pareidolias, apophenias, hierophanies or the real thing) is all about! Are you (and “your” Fitzmeyer) in complete denial of the fact Yeshu’a appeared to John in a garment (Gr himation = sindon) soaked/stained in blood and the TS translucent bloodied body double imprint can behave like an oversized Rorschach inkblot test and re project visions and semblances from the Book of Revelation through the eyes of an astute archaeoperceptive observer? Reminder: according to the Gospels of the Hebrews Yeshua’s gave his sindon to “the servant/auxiliary of the (high) priest”. Now at the time of the event, most likely John Mark was a young assistant scribe (= servant/assistant/auxiliary) of the High Priest (Hanan? and a son of the latter? see Tresmontant’s “Enquête sur l’Apocalypse”, 1994). Because of his secretarial role in the High Priest’s proximtiy, most likely too the young John Mark is the one who faithfully recorded Hanan’s exchange with Yeshu’a on that night at the Hanan Palace (unless you and Fitzmeyer can convincingly account for it otherwise, which I very much doubt). Could you tell me exactly what was the time of John’s vision from/of Yeshu’a appearing to him in a garment (Gr himation = sindon) soaked/stained in blood: 50 and/or 54 55 CE? 69 70 CE or 90 110 CE? Was is under Nero’s or Domitian regnal years? (According to you (and Fitzmyer and some other Biblical scholar “heavyweights” the Book of Revelation”has been dated to the second century and demonstrates some gnostic influence”. Methinks they make a confusion between esoteric coding of an image for the sake of prophecy and gnoticism stricto sensu. Besides John took up, among other oracles/prophecies, Jeremaiah’s and Isaiah’s oracles/prophecies (see Jer 50:8 ; 51:6 and Isaiah 48:20) and applied them to Jerusalem. Most likely he wrote it in the 50s (see Tresmontant’s rather convincing demonstration, ibidem, p. 351 375). Still waiting for yours answers to the following questions I asked you more than a day ago: Do you (and Fitzmyer) believe in prophecies that are SOON to be fulfilled i.e. “before a generation passses away”? If you do and in light of your deciphering Babylon and 666, then could you account for your decoding the seven headed beast (666) as Domitian) implying ipso facto Babylon codes the cty of Rome and tell me when exactly Rome was destroyed? And in the light of your alleged “deciphering”, could you (and Fitzmeyer) account for: – the prophecy in Rev 18:4 that reads: “And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her (= “Babylon”), MY PEOPLE (= early Christian community), that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues (= war, famine, plague and persecution)” – Rev 11:2: “But the court that is without the Temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the goyim: and the Holy City (= Jerusalem NOT Rome!) SHALL (upper cases mine; prophetic future tense) they (the goyim) tread under foot forty [and] two months.” (Rev11:2) Reminder: it took the Romans forty two months (september 7th, 70 CE earlymay 73 CE) to dismantle the Temple of Jerusalem – (Matt 24:34): “Very truly I tell you, THIS GENERATION (upper cases mine) will not pass away until all these things have happened.” – Eusebius of Caesarea writing that the early Christian community of Jerusalem had been commanded by AN ORACLE/PROPHECY given “BEFORE THE WAR” to depart from the city of Jerusalem (Eusebius Eccl. Hist. 3.5 and Panarion 30:2)? Reminder for you: Around the year 66 C.E., the early Christian community in Jerusalem evacuated to Pella in Jordan because of an oracle/ prophecy. Which was it according to you (and ‘ “your heavyweight”)? In sum, could you (and Fitzmyer) convincingly account for the prophecy in Rev. 18:4 and the Christian community of Rome’s flight from the city in the 1st or second c. CE after the city was burned and destroyed since the prophecy is to be fulfilled SOON (i.e. Before the present generation to which it is adressed passes away)? Could you account on historical grounds for Domitian’s persecution of the Christian community of Rome?

As the number of the SEVEN headed beast can refer to the Herodian dynasty that counts SEVEN kings. Could you as accurately account for Nero being described as a SEVEN headed beast? Then if 666 refers to Nero (actually NRWN KSR, “NERON CAESAR”, transliterated into Hebrew, renders the number in conjunction with seven letters), it does not make much sense and is not the sole encryption possibility since the very name “Horodos” was indifferently used in Greek, Aramaic and Hebrew by both Hellenistic and non Hellenistic Judeans. Now when transliterated in Hebrew, it is spelled with SEVEN letters and three vavs = .6.6.6.. In light of “the Acts” of the Seven Herodian Kings and the events related by Joseph Flavius and Philo of Alexandria (you should read or re read them), the reference to “Horodos” as .6.6.6. Does make sense, which it does not if 666 should refer to Nero. According to Tresmonant, the Book of Revelation was written at a time of Herodian persecutions of the early Christian community in the 50s C.E.. Actually the Herodian tyranny started with Herod the Great (Yeshua’s parents had to flee to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill the newly born Messia H) and ended with Herod Agrippa II (born in 37 C.E., he committed suicide in 68 C.E. When the empire revolted) whereas Nero’s persecution of the early Christian community started not until 64 C.E.. If you think .6.6.6. Refers to Nero not to “Horodos” (= standing for the Herodian dynasty of seven kings), it means you totally missed the fact, as early as the 50s C.E., John prophesied/predicted the destruction of Jerusalem to “those who have ears to hear and can hear”. The fact is the early Christian community around the time the war between Rome and Judea broke out in Caesarea (66 C.E.), the Christian community in Jerusalem evacuated to Pella in Jordan because of a prophecy: the one in the Book of Revelation.

Re. “your” ominous 666 coding Nero, lately a team of expert classicists, using new photographic techniques, “finally” thinks they deciphered the Book of Revelation original writing. According to the newly revisited fragment of THE OLDEST SURVIVING COPY of the New Testament, written in ancient Greek and dating FROM THE LATE THIRD CENTURY (as part of a hoard of previously unintelligible manuscripts discovered in historic dumps outside Oxyrhynchus in Egypt), instead of 666, the Antichrist’s name should be 616! Whence, according to Professor David Parker, Professor of New Testament Textual Criticism and Paleography at the University of Birmingham, “(616) is an example of gematria, where numbers are based on the numerical values of letters in people’s names. Early Christians would use numbers to hide the identity of people who they were attacking: 616 refers to the Emperor Caligula.” Ring some bell? In sum THE OLDEST SURVIVING COPY of the New Testament (late third of the 3rd c. CE) has 616 (and neither 666 nor “Six Hundred And Sixty Six”)! What now do you make of that?

(Tresmontant rather convincingly demonstrated the prophecy was in the Hebrew original version ot he Book of Revelation).

Besides HORODOS (right Hebrew form for Herod) is spelled with three vavs that can be read as three six as well embedded in his name while the Greek form NERON KAISAR and the Latin form NERO CAESAR translate the right Hebrew form NRON QSAR NOT the alleged ‘QSAR NERON’! BTW the alternative reading 616 (already known to Irenaeus, Adv. Haer. 5.28.2) neatly fits two Latin forms namely ‘Nero Caesar’ and ‘Caligula Caesar’ while neither NERO CAESAR nor CALIGULA CAESAR or Heb. “NRON QSAR” are names per se since both refer to a name AND a title. While Heb. HORODOS is a name per se. Most obviously Daveb uncritically and blindlingly relies too much on Ifrah’s totally biased gematric calculation.

How come you’re only aware of “six hundred and sixty six” whent there is the alternative reading six hundred sixten? If 666 codes Neron Caesar, how come then you cannot even account for Nero being referred to as the SEVEN headed beast? Besides if 666 codes Nero Caesar, Babylon codes Rome, how can you account for the prophecy in Rev 18:4 and it reads: “And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her (= “Babylon”), MY PEOPLE (= early Christian community), that you be not partakers of her sins, and that you receive not of her plagues (= war, famine, plague and persecution)” and Eusebius of Caesarea writing that the early Christian community of Jerusalem had been commanded by AN ORACLE/PROPHECY given “before the war” to depart from the city of Jerusalem (Eusebius Eccl. Hist. 3.5 and Panarion 30:2)? Reminder: Around the year 66 C.E., the early Christian community in Jerusalem evacuated to Pella in Jordan because of an oracle/ prophecy. Do still really think “Babylon” originally had coded Rome? PLAIN COMMON SENSE tells us “IT JUST COULD NOT HAVE”. Here is Tresmontant’s argumentum ad absurdum reasoning (see L’Enquête): “Babylone, dans ce texte chiffré, ne peut désigner la ville de Rome pour une raison simple. Supposons un instant avec la majorité des critiques que l’Apocalypse ait été composée et diffusée vers la fin du règne de Domintien, autour de l’année 96 (Now Louis most erroneously wrote: “It –i.e.The Book of Revelation– has been dated to the second century and demonstrates some gnostic influence”?!).” “Les chrétiens de cette époque là n’étaient pas plus sots que ceux d’auhourd’hui. Jean sans l’Apocalyspe, annonce depuis le début que LE TEMPS EST PROCHE (upper cases mine), QUE C’ESR IMMINENT (upper cases mine), QU’IL N’Y AURA PLUS DE DELAI (upper cases mine). Or la ville de Rome n’a pas été détruite au IIème siècle ni plus tard. La communauté chrétienne de Rome ne s’est pas enfuie comme un seul homme, ou plutôt comme une seule femme, comme lui commande Apocalypse 18,4.” “Par conséquent, très vite les chrétiens de ce temps là auraient constaté que les prophéties de l’Apocalypse cntre la ville de Rome ne se réalisent pas. C’est donc une fausse prophétie. Si c’est une fausse prophétie, on n’en tient plus compte. On ne recopie pas l’Apocalypse dans les communautés chrétiennes. Et donc nus n’aurions plus à cette heure le manuscrit de l’Apocalypse dans les communautés chrétiennes. Nous ne saurions même pas qu’elle a esxité. Lorsque, aux IIème et IIIème siicles, l’Apocalypse a été attaquée pour des raisons diverses, PERSONNE N’A JAMAIS MIS EN AVANT CET ARGUMENT (upper cases mine) qui aurait été décisif : L’APOCALYPSE ANNONCE LA DESTRUCTION INTEGRALE, SUBITE, TOTALE ET IMMINENTE DE LA VILLE DE ROME. OR ROME N’A PAS ETE DETRUITE (upper cases mine). Donc l’Apocalypse est une fausse prophétie !” “LA VILLE DE JERUSALEM A ETE DETRUITE TOTALEMENT AUX MOIS D’AOÛT ET SEPTEMBRE DE L’ANNEE 70 ET QUELQUES ANNEES AUPARAVANT LA PETITE COMMUNAUTE CHRETIENNE DE JERUSALEM S’EST ENFUIE (upper cases mine), comme lui avait commandé Apocalypse 18,4.” John took up Jeremy’s and Isaiah’s oracles/prophecies (see Jer 50:8 ; 51:6 and Isaiah 48:20) and applied them to Jerusalem. Most likely he wrote it in the 50s (see Tresmontant’s rather convincing demonstration, ibidem, p. 351 375). To Louis re the Four Apocalyptic Horses (war, famine, plague and persecution), they are a quadruple “cryptic pareidoliac allegory/vision” of the TS man’s/Yeshua’s then undamaged ventral bloodied body imprint recorded on his burial Sindon/Himation i.e. To be deciphered as an oversized Rorschach inkblot test. Archaeoperceptively speaking and most likely, the apocalyptic visions implies the burial Sindon/Himation image was seen in turn in bright daylight and at least at two different observation distances (red and white pareidoliac horses), on oncoming dusk (dark pareidolac horse) and at full or new moon night (greenish yellow/yellowish green horse pareidoliac image)..","date":"2015-06-27","mins":"4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/was-laudato-si-and-the-popes-visit-to-the-shroud-related/","cat":"2015","title":"Was Laudato Si and the Pope’s Visit to the Shroud Related?"},{"id":"comment-203828","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"More typo: Jean dans l’Apocalyspe.","date":"2015-06-27","mins":"4:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/was-laudato-si-and-the-popes-visit-to-the-shroud-related/","cat":"2015","title":"Was Laudato Si and the Pope’s Visit to the Shroud Related?"},{"id":"comment-203829","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"They are more typos yet I have no time to correct them all.

Who’s really posting “rubbish”? YOU ARE! First you wrote I was a “Polish immigrant living in Rezé, France”. Methinks you’ve got to know both my parents were French, which cannot make me a “Polish immigrant”, you freaking idiot! Besides what is your problem with Polish immigrants? Secondly, you implicitly boast yourself of having published in a leading daily (and monthly?) and I haven’t–have you? Since you’re a free lance journalist, this would the least expected! Absent the fact I made a couple of oral presentations or contributions at Shroud conferences (in France, Italy, Poland), had an article on Knight Templars’ enigmatic graffitis published in France in 2010 and I’am about to publish an 80 page monography on my deciphering of the Knight Templars’ egnimatic graffitis in the Coudray Tower. I localized the place where most if not all the Christic relics that disappeared at the French Revolution, are buried. Hope to be allowed to make an expedition. Besides I can give you a list of my still unpublished discoveries in sindonology along with a list of the research I have been conducting on the TS for now more than a quarter of a century. I did make a few discoveries! Could YOU tell me what are your discoveries in sindonology?

Further, you said that that is what made the Shroud become yellow! You are indulging in feverish imagination. Why? As I pointed out previously, this water was used on very few occasions because it was very costly. It was not used to wash dead bodies, it was used to purify people who had touched a dead body.” Firstly, I’m not trying to convince anybody, just give people food for thought re a new avenue. My thought experiment or red heifer waters acting as light mordant/fumigation scenario is based on experimental archeological pre reconstructions (wrapping in shrouds) in light of Christolipsology, philology (Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek), achaeoastronomy, the Gospels, Biblical and Talmudic Literatures, Second Temple period burial practices, custom and rites, Ancient Textiles mechanics and chemistry, Paleaoantomopathology, archaeological bloodstain analysis, reconstructive cryptology etc. Archaeologically and chemically speaking my red heifer waters acting as light mordant/fumigation scenario, in the hypothesis the TS is Yeshu’a, is far less speculative than the gesso or flour scenarios. It does hold water (British biochemis/chemist, Colin Berry went as far as attempting to sort of recycle my theory and develop a fraudulist scenario that would sort of parallel mine in terms of use of an alkali solution and mordanting). Secondly I never wrote “the Shroud was washed with the ashes of a red heifer mixed with water” but Yeshua’ shed innocent blood had to be purified. Once you misleadingly wrote: “it is HIGHLY (upper cases mine) doubtful that Joseph, being a member of the Sanhedrin, would have Jesus buried as an innocent man.” Oh really? Just prove it? What say the Gospels? reminder for the free lance journalist: Yeshua’s buriers were Sanhedrin members who HAD NOT TAKEN A HAND IN Yeshua’s sentence to death because most likely they were his secret disciples and thought him innocent. Yeshua died on the cross and was INNOCENT i.e. WITHOUT SIN if those words has a meaning for a Catholic as they had for Yeshua’s disciples then. Besides, you does seem to ignore SHED INNOCENT BLOOD WAS A POLLUTANT in the Second Temple period, which speaks volume on how familiar you’re with the Talmud literature and the halacha!!! Now I’m asking the 21th c. CE free lance journalist, how could Second Temple period Judean allow themselves to keep Yeshua’ burial shrouds had not their master’s shed innocent blood that was a pollutant not been purified via the red heifer waters whether on Yeshua’s burial or after his resurrection? In my reconstructive scenario the sindon/himation was first dipped in boiling red heifer waters then stretched taut front and back lengthwise. Then the stiff rigid body was compressed widthwise in smaller burial shrouds prior to being fumigated with aloetic wood. On fumigation, the sindon/himation used as inner burial shroud shrank and get sort of taut again front ad back. Methinks you know very little about the red heifer waters as a slightly corrosive purifying/cleansing product! And you indignation is just a mask to hide out your mischief making on the sly. Re my expertise on Knight Templars, the Ancient Graffiti Museum Director, the late Serge Ramond, Ulysse , Director of the Château de Chinon, Director of the Château de Loches, Pascal Poirier asked me do make an oral presentation on Knights Templar’s graffitis at the 4th congress of glyptography, Loches, 2006 (see the proceedings published in 2010, ASPAG et le Conseil Général d’Indre et Loire).

Firstly, Mr. Figueiredoc’s lying tongue: I never insulted Barrie! On June 19, 2015 at 6:14 am, I just wrote: “Barrie Schwortz who wrote/told Yannick Clément: “if they (Yeshua’s buriers) did use coins, they CERTAINLY (upper cases mine) would not have put a pagan Caesar coin on the face of the prophesized Messiah!”, is totally wrong. The Pilate coin devices were specifically designed to agree with BOTH Roman and Judean sensitivities (e.g. The lituus once seen through the Judean’s eyes as shevet (“rod” or “sceptre of Judah”) on the contrary can/does refer to the prophesized Messiah!). Schwortz (without even being aware!) bases his opinion on false premises (Stauffer pseudo theory and unsubstantiated numismatic evidence) and does lack archaeoperceptive ambivalence/sight and brain coordination system flexibilty in terms of Romans’ and Judeans’ image and symbol respective reference frame.” (Unless Mr. Figuereidoc as sole judge and blog arbiter of this blog considers anybody who thinks Barrie is leaving his field of expertise –technical photography– or totally overlooking whence exactly the Pilate coin offensiveness pseudo theory comes from, is insulting; unless Mr. Figueiredoc thinks Barrie is infallible and his opinion Gospel Truth even if Barrie is neither a professional numismatist nor an ancient Jewish coin scholar or even a Second Temple period Judean no matter how as a 20th 21st CE Jewish he can excel in technical photography and Turin Shroud oral presentations) BTW, Barrie can defend himself all right.

Right in the beginning I pointed out that thix mixture was used to wash people who touched a dead body, it was a purification ritual. The mixture was also very costly, making it unlikely that Jews in general could afford it.” In the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s (long inner) burial shroud: Firstly, Louis de Figuereido deliberately distorts/misrepresents my opinion to ridicule it (intellectual dishonesty = a lying tongue) as I never claimed “Jesus’ BODY was WASHED (upper case mine) with red heifer ashes mixed with water”. I just wrote Yeshua’s shed innocent blood should/had to be PURIFIED (since it was a pollutant as far as Holy land was concerned) and the best purifying product available then was the red heifer waters especially for his rich buriers who thought he was the prophesied Messiah and who had not taken a hand in Yeshua’s death sentence (they were his secret disciples). Secondly Louis de Figuereido misleadingly wrote (because he is a poor NT exegete: “The mixture was also very costly, making it unlikely that Jews in general could afford it” while totally overlooking the fact Yeshua’s buriers were Sanhedrin members (at least two of them) and consequently were rich men who could afford the costly ref heifer waters (reminder for the alleged Brasilian “biblical scholar”, Louis de Figueiredo: Yossef used his own newly hewn memorial cave tomb and fine linen sindon/himation on Yeshua’s burial while Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about 100 litra). Thirdly: Can Louis de Figuereido account for the Yeshua’s Second temple period Jewish disciples having kept their master’s sindon/himation that was used as inner burial shroud and came into contact with Yeshua’s stiff rigid corpse? Reminder for the alleged “biblical scholar”, Louis e Figuereido: the red heifer waters are NOT ONLY used “to wash people who touched a dead body” BUT ALSO to purify objects that came into contact with a corpse. Now the sindon/himation DID COME INTO CONTACT with Yeshua’s stiff rigid dead body. Can Louis de Figueiredo tell us how Yeshua’s sindon/himation used as inner burial shroud was purified so that his disciples could be allowed to keep it as a memento? Any suggestion Mr. Figuereidoc? Fourthly: I never wrote the yellowish colour could be due TO THE SOLE use of the red heifer water (uric acid residues, time patina are involved too). The fact remains though because of the very presence of starch residues, soaking a linen fabric in a mildly corrosive lye water (i.e. Animal and/or wood ashes mixed with water) such as the red heifer waters allows them to have a yellowish white colour.

Absent the pre washing out of the blood (through wearing a woollen tunic in conjunction with heavy sweating on his way to the cross + a pre burial linen napkin or sudarium placed over his head to soak up and keep his blood oozing from his nose and mouth on the cross and on the way to the tomb) or the Gospel accounts of Yeshua’s burial (in terms of winding, compressing and fastening his body in shrouds), my theory can account for what precisely other theories/scenatios have totally failed to do so far namely: – body imprint/image superficiality and blood appearing too reddish in terms of light or pre mordant joining with the linen fibers and the gelatinized starch (as ultra fine printing paste/medium) to set the straw yellow colour (as thin layer of carbohydrate impurities that makes up the body image) permanently and along with the freshly dried blood (remoistened with aqueous alkaline solution) to set the carmine red colour through myrrhic woodaloetic fumigation/burning and exposure to carbon monoxide liberated along with smoke in the course of a specific Judean ritual. Reminders: (light) mordant is known to be used for intensifying stains e.g. In cell or tissue preparations. Red Heifer ashes and/or Melche/Jerusalem limestone dust mixed with warm/hot (55° 85° Celsius) water can gelatinized residual starch (alkali gelatinization) present in the ancient linen cloth (if starch was really detected or used on the TS) and could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now it is well known gelatin is a breakdown product of collagen. – collimation in terms of self collimated light mordanting extended to the back and front of the stiff rigid corpse of the crucifixion victim’s bloodied body (the crucifixion victim’s ‘smooth wet and dust covered textile skin’ –or ‘second skin’ aka his aqueous alkali solution in soaked inner winding burial sheet now known as the Turin Shroud–, tightly moulded over his dust lactic acid residues blood covered body, acting as an image enhancing membrane for accurately aligning (collimating) compressible and de compressible vapour flow and orthogonally moving in terms of body to cloth gradual shrinking and unsticking front and back by means of the said flow as a thermal actuator. – 3 D volumetric recording of the crests and valleys of the bloodied body (the clean sindon/himation being used as a long narrow inner winding burial sheet in soaked with an aqueous alkali solution and tightly moulded over his dust lactic and uric acid residues blood covered body) was first tautly wrapped lengthwise around the stiff rigid bloodied body from head to toe and then manually compressed widthwise in shorter dry clean outer shrouds to be subjected to a (myrrhic?) xyloaloetic fumigation and then the inner burial winding sheet slightly decompressed while sort of getting taut again through drying and shrinking). Reminder: whether it be 3 D printing of a crucifixion victim body between two sheets of linen cloth or small sprigs of fresh herbs, the fresh individual flowers and/or freshly caught fishes between two sheets of (blotting) paper, such a process requires moulding by either manually rubbing, pressing or compressing crests and valleys between the said sheets – neatness and tidiness (or integrity) of blood clots (through a cloth to body skin sticking and gradual unsticking process) while the very presence of “opaques” from the Judean desert could account for the Body image fuzziness. …just to name a few..","date":"2015-12-18","mins":"3:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216947","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder one for the alleged “biblical scholar Louis de Figueiredo: the ashes of the red heifer (mixed with spring waters = water of lustration) were used NOT ONLY in the ritual purification of persons AND objects defiled by a corpse (Num. 19 (BTW Yeshua’s long inner shroud had been defiled by its very contact with his stiff rigid corpse all the more so as it was all covered in his shed innocent blood).BUT ALSO to atone for the bloodguilt of the unidentified manslayer (Deut. 21:3) that is for anyone (be he an unnamed Sanhedrin member who, along with his fellow colleagues had had a hand in sentencing to death an innocent whose innocent blood had been actually shed in the Holy Land). Reminder two: In the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s long inner burial shroud, in the gospels, it is written Yeshua was buried according to the JUDEAN burial custom besides Yeshua’s stiff rigid body was not just draped but just wrapped/encircled, but COMPRESSED and FASTENED too (see the 3 different conjugated koine Greek verbs used by the 4 evangelists and the koine Greek word for ‘shorter shrouds/pieces of linen’ (othonia). Besides in light of the Hebrew time markers and translation entropy (from Aramaic/Hebrew to koine/translation Greek), the burial time frame between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath is four hours (maximal time frame) and two two and a half hours (minimal time frame) NOT about half an hour (according to a die hard misinterpretation Lde F, one among many, keeps parroting unawareas they are of the translation entropy). As to the very reddiness of the bloodstains on the Turin Sindonand the slightly transluscent straw yellow body image, they does imply the idea of (speedy) purification ritual and the use of a mildly corrosive sort of lye wate (the red heifer wters) .in conjunction with starch residues present in old linen.
