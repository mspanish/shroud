Reminder: the Hebrew word taharah means “purification” in terms of “dressing/wrapping in shrouds”, “washing”, “drying” and “anointing” as core procedures. Reminder in the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s: Because the women had to abide by the Halakha (Judean religious law), anointing was not performed though as they were not allowed to grind solid/granulised spices to make spicy oily perfumes after sunset on Sabbath (even had the grinding been initiated before sunset). Hence Yeshua’s body was not anointed on his burial. Because the TS man’s shed innocent blood was to be buried with his body, the latter was not washed as carefully as a non bloodied corpse, thus implying the very long burial (inner) sheet (known today as the TS) could have been used as part and parcel of the speedy purifying and drying ritual to save time and funeral items. The only snag here is no matter how talented the forensic medical examiners are/were (from Bucklin to Zugibe or Baima Bollone or Cameron), they are neither palaeopathologists nor forensic archaeologists familiar with ancient Judean funerary customs, practices and rites or archaeological bloodstained pattern analysts and just could not reach a consensus when it came to the “washing or no washing issue”. Besides they were only working from lifesize Turin Shroud negative/positive photographs not from a real corpse. In the hypothesis the TS is Yeshua’s, both archaeologically and forensically speaking, it is most likely though the body was speedily but ritually “purified” and dried out in a most specific way (that of the Second Temple period Judeans) so as to bury “the shed (innocent) blood” with the corpse and abide by the Halakha. In order to achieve this and “purify” flies’s eggs/larvae, dust, dirt, blood and other body fluids, the Judean buriers could have soaked the long (inner) burial linen sheet in an alkaline solution. On March 16, 2013 at 11:40 a.m. (#5 Reply) and 7:35 p.m. (#21 Reply): I wrote: “As far as the archaeological bloodstain pattern analysis is concerned: – Natural mordanting of dry blood remoistened with aqueous alkaline solution along with drying through myrrhic aloetic (wood aloe) fumigation could account for: – The aged bloodstains still “looking fresh” today when seen in full day on the long inner burial cloth as if the blood had just been shed the day before. Mordant is known to be used for INTENSIFYING STAINS e.g. In cell or tissue preparations – Potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now it is well known gelatine is a breakdown product of collagen. The true fact is low temperature (55° 85° C) alkali gelatinisation of starch residuals present in the ancient linen cloth could be a possible factor as bubbling very fine printing paste to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process. – Bilirubin is neither the problem nor the solution, just probably one part of the whole equation as it could have been trapped (along with carbon monoxide?) during the image formation process. – Most likely dust, dirt and body fluids should be found in the very impurity layer that makes up the body image.” Jesterof, you also wrote: “Your remark about the lighter head part due to the Oviedo head scarf is very interesting. Would like to learn more as well – from you.” Methinks you missed my point or got rather confused.

Re Yeshua’s burial time frame: most obviously you missed one of my previous post (April 23, 2013 at 6:56 am (#61 Reply): “The true fact is Judean liberal Pharisees were allowed to complete a burial rite on the Sabbath (once initiated) even after sunset if need be to honor the deceased as long as they didn’t move the body. Because the women had to abide by the Halakha (Judean religious law), anointing was not performed though as they were not allowed to grind solid/granulised spices to make spicy oily perfumes after sunset (even had the grinding been initiated before sunset) on Sabbath. Hence Yeshua’s body was not anointed on his burial. Therfore anointing on the third day shall be considered in the light of the ancient Judean tradition of paying a visit to the deceased on the three or seven days immediately following his burial that is to prevent unpleasant smells. Besides, Yeshua’s burial as related in the Gospels, doesn’t mean at all that at least four of the five Judean burial core procedures (namely speedy burial, wrapping in shrouds, specific purifying and drying were not completed within a minimum 2 hours 2hours and a half time frame (i.e. Till the apparition of the third star heralding the Shabbath).”.","date":"2013-06-05","mins":"3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35268","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"…unless YC thinks Barbet was himself over simplistic when it comes to interpret aged/archaeological blood..","date":"2013-05-29","mins":"1:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"id":"comment-35237","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"This not a convincing argument.

In other words, they are not “superficial images” but in the thickness of the linen fabric and do completely run through the material (capillary action). They are dried fluid images. This is pretty obvious ONLY when the said areas are observed in transmtted light or from photograph taken in transmitted light (see 1988 Riggi photographs). French Shroud scholar Marcel Alonso noticed it well before me: “L’hypothèse de la double superficialité de l’image (Fanti, Rogers, 2005) est démentie par l’image en transmission prise par Riggi en 1988, qui montre qu’elle existe bien dans l’épaisseur du tissu.” and “les images par transmission laissent voir un léger épaississement des fils, dans les mailles (pourtant lâches), confirmant la présence de l’image dans la profondeur du tissage. En effet, les fils dont le diamètre est 100 fois plus grand que les fibres n’ont pu piéger un surcroît de liquides, colloïdes et particules associées, qu’aux points de contacts entre eux. Ce seront les zones ayant retenu dans leurs mailles le plus de fluides qui apparaîtront après séchage les plus sombres (celles au contact des cheveux, moustache, barbe, sourcils…). C’est une preuve supplémentaire en faveur du principe d’image capillaire, opposé au à celui d’image radiative.” (the above mentioned observations are extracted from a paper entitled “Le Linceul est il Surnaturel ?” Alonso wrote in 2005). On February , 2012, I quoted French Shroud scientist Marcel Alonso: “The hypothesis of the double superficiality of the [face Shroud] image (Fanti, Rogers, 2005) is belied by the image in transmitted light taken by Riggi in 1988. [To the sole exception of the right side of the Shroud man’s long flowing hair], the image shows that it does exist in the thickness of the fabric.” In spite of image enhancement, most of the left side of the face actually does not even clearly appear on the backside of the long linen cloth.

Now in the 1990s CE, Italian MD, Sebastiano RODANTE and Italian ancient coin collector Mario MARONI convincingly demonstrated a small coin of the augur wand/lituus type placed over the eye of a deceased head held upright or stilted forward can fall into the mouth as the body decays.

Methinks The placing of coins over the deceased eyes is sort of an original recycling of the Hellenistic custom of placing a coin or two in the deceased’s mouth. Most likely, there were specific circumstances in which (rich?) Judean buriers or mourners recurred to placing coins over eyes not only to prevent the deceased’s eyelids to lift up or to hide his/her open/half open eyes but also to honour the deceased’s memory and abide by the Halakha(Judean religious law)when the eulogy was not allowed to be pronounced. In the years 2003 2004, my personal investigation of the issue led me to seriously consider the possibility of coins central devices and/or legend to be used (within Second Temple period Judean context) in a manner of puzzle or rebus (i.e. Via image and word plays in Hebrew, Aramaic and even Greek) to have silent eulogy. Reminder: no eulogy for instance should be pronounced during burials occuring in the month of Nissan. Now in the hypothesis the TS man is Yeshua, he was put to death in the very month of Nissan at a time when most definitely a eulogy just could not be pronounced over his body (today it is allowed/ tolerated to pronounce a eulogy only over great Torah Teachers’ bodies though). I even went as far as reconstructing both a short and long version of the TS man’s silent eulogy by means of Pilate coins symbols and legends (see my 2005 unpublished paper “Linceul de Turin : L’Eloge Funèbre du Christ Retrouvée ? ou Tentative de décrytptage d’un très singulier rebus monétaire”)..","date":"2014-03-19","mins":"9:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"id":"comment-90764","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Dave, re the full face and body veil or niqab Islamic women are required to wear in Saudi Arabia, I should say what is little known by westerners and even most Muslims: originally Muhammad’s brides went unveiled.

Most likely, shortly prior to the stiff rigid body image formation, the TS, used as moistened long inner shroud, was FIRST tightly wrapped up lengthwise around the body all covered in freshly dried blood to account for such accurate front and back haematic cartography. In other words, the TS was FIRST moulding the body front and back (even the back of the kees!), no question! Besides,this would be totally consistent with the 3 koiné Greek words used in the Gospels to descruibe Yeshu’s body as encircled/wrapped – compressed/tightly wrapped – fastened/bound in shrouds along with spices, which could include fresh flower heads used as insect repellent. The TS man’s dressing in shrouds needed 5 6 buriers on hasty burial (i.e. Within 2 hours – 2 hours and a half with only four out of five of the core burial procedures performed: 0/the long inner buial shroud is in soaked/moistened with (warm?) alkaline waters 1/then it is taut in extra height on two raised stones or piles of bags of spices 2/then the in soaked/moistened inner burial cloth is tautly wrapped lengthwise around the body stiff rigid as a wooden board 3/the latter’s ‘hills’ and ‘valleys’ front and back are manally moulded while compressed widhwise with other (dry) burial shrouds (along with spices and objects) 4/then the tightly wrapped up stiff rigid body, once placed on its right side and in extra height on the 2 raised stones or piles of bags of spices, is subjected to a ritual (myrrhic aloetic) fumigation (acting in conjunction with body hyperthermia?)in order to dry out the long inner burial shroud moulding the body front and back 5/then the compressed long inner burial shroud gradually and slightly comes unstuck from skin till it gets sort of taut again through drying out and shrinking (only first close contact AND then gradual loss of cloth to body contact through gradual pressure release can account for such a high definition/volumetric recording front and back of the stiff rigid body image on the TS inner side since basically the physical chemical reaction shall have been anaerobic back and front and collimated thanks to ‘opaques’ present in desert and/or limestone dust) 6/ as a result the dried out long inner shroud is no longer tightly compressed widthwise but sort of taut again through shrinking, which implies two cloth to body configurations: one to account for the TS neat blood imprint and another for the high definition/volumetric body image (a fact that is curently and most curiously overlooked by both ‘fraudulists’ and ‘supernaturalists’ and even most ‘naturalists’) 7/ most likely the body, once tightly wrapped up in the shrouds (= koiné Gr. Othonia), is finally encircled in a all envelopping shroud (Heb. Sovev, Jerusalem Heb. Aram. Sudara, koiné Greek soudarion, see the Kornelimunster “Sudarium” as representative or genuine relic of Yeshua’s burial) 8/ thus most likely the reaction of Maillard was interrupted via corpse fumigation.

In the Second Temple period any corpse should be purified, dried out, dressed up/wrapped up in clean shrouds/burial cloths and speedily buried to abide by the halakha. Those were the core procedures. If some may fall in your most curious ‘take and leave’ interpretative line, here are a few additional reminders and questions for you: Reminder one: The actual maximum time frame (between Yeshua’s death on the cross and the apparition of the 3rd star heralding Shabbath) for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. His burial was NOT dispatched in less than half an hour as it is currently yet wrongly claimed. Yossef Ha Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), DID NOT wait until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him at the risk of not abiding by the halakha and dishonouring his master’s memory! Just bear in mind too Yeshua was buried in the memorial tomb of Yosseph, a rich man, and not just thrown into a pit as a criminal. The rich man and secret disciple used the sindon/hemation he HAD bought for his own burial and used his newly hewn own garden tomb near by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus both did abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to the burial and honour his master’s memory. Speedy burials’ is the norm as far as Jewish/Judean funerary customs, practice and rites are concerned NOT the other. Reminder two: The 3 different conjugated koine Greek verbs used by the 4 evangelists meaning bind/fasten – compress/wrap up – wind/encircle and the koine Greek word for ‘shorter shrouds/pieces of linen’ (othonia) do imply Yeshua’s body was tightly wrapped up in shrouds not just draped over or loosely bound for the women to wash, anoint and tightly wrap up his naked body in shrouds at the first morning hour of the first day of the Hebrew week, that is just after the Shabbat, on the third day of Yeshua’s death. Most likely the stiff rigid body tightly wrapped up in shrouds (along with flower heads, ferocious thorns –used as stitches to hold the shrouds together– and even objects and tokens?) was encircled widthwise in a much larger “all enveloping shroud” or sovev in Hebrew, sudara in Aramaic (the Korneilmünster Shroud = the Johannine “soudarion”?). Reminder three: Most likely, the neat haematic cartography resulted from a sticking gradual unsticking transfer mechanism implying first the clean long inner burial sheet soaked in an aqueous alkali solution (made of living or rainwater + ashes and/or limestone dust) and tautly drawn lenthgwise back and front from head to toes, was compressed widthwise with shorter dry clean shrouds (othonia) as ALL PARTS of the body should be wrapped up (see Naḥmanides, Torat ha Adam; Inyan ha hoẓa’ah) and then, most likely, the tightly wrapped up bloody corpse was subjected to fumigation (see see 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum) and the long inner burial sheet somehow got taut again back and front through shrinking up.To his likley five six buriers and (secret) disciples Yeshua was no am ha arets (“average citizen) but a prophet (and even the Messiah) whose freshly dried innocent blood had been shed, and should be kept with his body and purify. In the case here under study, Second Temple period speedy tahara in terms of wrapping in shrouds, purifying & drying out was an act of ultimate kindness to honor the deceased who died a violent death. It shall not be mistaken with careful physical cleansing Jewish/Judean ritual of a NON bloody body.The (myrrhic?) aloetic fumigation rite temporarily made up too for the anointing procedure that could not have been performed on burial since grinding spices was not allowed on shabbat to prepare spicy oils. Actually the women came back to Yeshua’s tomb after shabbath JUST TO ANOINT/apply the spicy oil perfumes to his wrapping shrouds (NOT TO WASH, ANOINT AND tightly WRAP up his naked body in shrouds as it is currently misthought). In the koine Greek Gospels, do you really read Yeshua’s shroud was just draped over or loosely bound? And, besides anointing, do you really read the women were to wash and tightly wrap up Yeshua’s body in shrouds/linens clothes on Sunday morning? Why the wrapping in shrouds/linen clothes SHOULD be read as ONLY metaphoric in the Gospels while the anointing procedure the women were about to perform on Sunday Morning SHOULD be read as referring not only to FACTUAL anointing to be but also to FACTUAL washing and wrapping to be (had Yeshua’s body be still in the tomb)? This implicit interpretative line makes no sense a tall. Reminder four: As a victim of a violent death, Yeshua’s body should be buried with his shed innocent blood and his post mortem blood could not be DIRECTLY cleansed. The use of alkaline solution along with (myrrhic )aloetic fumigation) could account for potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now these two signals precisely tend to prove the body could have been purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial custom/practice. The true archaeological fact is there is more than one way by which blood could have become depleted of key ingredients if one considers the bloody body purifying & drying ritual scenario, which Adler clearly did not (crucifixion being an implicit assumption in all his discussion at the expense of specific burial practices, rites and customs). It is light years’ far from proven yet the burial cloth was just draped about or loosely bound the TS man’s body and the image recording implies JUST ONE body to cloth configuration. YOUR interpretation is plain conjecture not mine. Mine is substantiated as far as forensic archaeological textile imprint and bloodstain pattern analyses, Judean/ancient Jewish burial practices and Biblical and Gospel accounts are concerned. Now you’re totally in denial the TS bloodied body front and back image recording calls for at least TWO DIFFERENT cloth to body CONFIGURATIONS (one resulting from tightly moulding/compressing the relief of the corresponding area with the linen cloth –in soaked most likely with a watery solution– and another resulting from the gradual shrinking of the cloth while getting somewhat taut again front and back and unsticking –through a drying procedure and a resulting pressure release front and back), how then could you account for only one body to cloth configuration or in other words how could you account for: 1/ the correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3 D structure of a human body? 2/ the discrepancy between the apparent location of some bloodstains on the cloth versus the body image and their real location on the corpse, e.g. The oozing APPEARING to be in the hair image when actually it was first recorded at cheek level? 3/ the fact that, to the sole exception of the bony areas of the eye sockets and nasal septum, all the rest of the face shows irregular features and displacements. Reminder: – most likely the TS man’s face was compressed by a sindon, sweat veil and skull cap (not to mention the possible use of a smal “jaw box” made of three wooden pieces to keep the mouth closed, see my reconstruction).Now a forensic examination of the nose area reveals that in this operation the cartilaginous or fleshy rounded part of the nose would have been squashed. Actually the Sindon face tells us this area is not only squashed but also turned to the left with the TS man’s face right profile appearing as if embedded in his facial image. 3/ the very fact the small of the back is recorded (despite lordosis) while the image at buttock level (upper thigh area) is not, which is not consistent at all with Mario’s explanation 4/ the left thigh image being LARGER than expected compared to the right thigh one? 5/ neither the backside image nor the calve images (of the anatomical left leg bent a little more than the right leg) appearing flattened but round AS IF these areas were ‘elevated’ AWAY FROM underlying shroud? Do you really advocate levitation? Reminder: The very fact the buriers took great care not to disturb the blood is totally consistent with an ancient Judean/Jewish burial custom in terms of corpse covered in blood tahara (purification ritual). It has nothing to do with a supernatural event. Re the backside gap, the latter JUST CANNOT be explained “by either the distance of the cloth from the body, […] or possibly by packing with flora or spices.” There is a visual body image discontinuity most likely due to a “S ease fold”. 6/ the presence of some scourge marks at popliteal fossae (back of the knees) level while there is no back of the (partially flexed) knee images? Reminder: Miller and Pellicori UV photos do show that there are scourge marks and yet no (or next to no) body image (this in conjunction with an air gap). The eye brain coordination system has somehow “to fill the anatomical/air gap” (see Fanti’s most circumlocutive prose misleadingly describing the scourge marks “in correspondence to lower luminance levels of the body image”, A69 in Evidences for Testing Hypotheses about the Body … ) In the light of the general economy of the TS man HD bloody body image, such paradoxical visual evidence is consistent with: a/a blood comes first body image second scenario b/creation of an air gap as the (watery solution in soaked) long inner burial sheet (TS) first stuck to the body (hence the mirror image of blood transfer by direct contact) and then somehow got taut (too rapidly for the popliteal fossae to be correctly recorded and 3 D encoded). 7/ the unusually long arms and seemingly long fingers on the right hand image imply both dislocation ( and uneven sindon stretching at arm level? During the image formation process, the tightly pulled and compressed in soaked long inner burial sheet didn’t quite return to its natural size and shape as it got sort of taut again lengthwise through shrinking (through drying out). The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from adduction to abduction thus creating sort of a stiff rigid arm counter pressure to shrouds’ wrapping up pressure. Through drying out and slight cloth to body pressure release as the Shroud got somewhat taut again through shrinking, the arms mechanically tended to slightly raised again above body. It resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint. Yes indeed, in the light of the TS bloodied dorsal and ventral body imprints and the three other Gospel accounts, John 19: 40 can read: “Then they took the body of Yeshua, and wound and compressed and fastened it in linen shrouds with the spices, as the manner of the Judeans is to bury”..","date":"2015-06-09","mins":"9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines"},{"id":"comment-201423","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder for Daveb: you wrote “the Shroud cloth had to be drawn quite firmly over the top of the head to match the likely distance between the ventral and dorsal images”, which is in sharp contrast with your other claim the shroud cloth was loosely draped over/loosely bound the TS man’s body..","date":"2015-06-09","mins":"2:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines"},{"id":"comment-201427","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Additional reminders, on January 30, 2015 at 7:44 am I wrote: “The TS man’s face show many an image deficit implying air gaps and/or presence of screening objects. 3 D images can give you a fairly good idea of the way prominent crease marks at headtop and chin level did fit the TS man’s head and imply the latter was bound and compressed as the (then watery solution in soaked) shroud, literally do appear moulded around his head, front (and back).

They read as follows: “Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:45 46) “And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Mark 15:33 34) My Comment: Opening verse of Psalm 22 stands here for the whole psalm. One shall be reminded the “yet” in verse 3 turns around forsakenness into deliverance. It has the ring of truth as for time immemorial, psalm 22 is one of the psalms pious Jews use TO RECITE DURING THE PROCESS OF DYING or whenever they found themselves in difficult situations. And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, certainly this was a righteous man. 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. (Luke 23:44 48) SHOULD the three passages above to be taken just as metaphors and be pious lies? If we are to fall in YC’s most curious ‘take and leave’ interpretative line: Why SHOULD anyone consider too the very fact that Rabbi Yeshua is reported in the Gospels to have died at the ninth hour of the day (i.e. Exactly “between the two evenings”, beyn ha arbayim in Hebrew), be true/an historical reality? Why SHOULD NOT YC or anyone read it just as another literary device/forgery to most artificially have Exodus 29:38 41 (“They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha arbayim” = at the ninth hour of the day) symbolically fit the event? Why SHOULD YC give more credence to Rabbi Yeshua’s time of death and hold darkness at the resurrection to be a pious lie? Etc. After committing the fallacy of arguing ad nauseam from silence as far as Adler, Rogers, Barbet are concerned YC now commits the fallacy of arguing ad nauseam from chronic metaphor/pious lie as far as Matthew, Mark and Luke are concerned. The true fact remains though a simply naturalistic explanation, namely a Judean desert dust storm of great magnitude blowing in Jerusalem (followed or not by the rising of a bloody moon) could rationally account for the darkness at crucifixion. Would YC be unable for once to apply his dearest Occam razor principle when it comes to this specific issue? From his Quebecois viewpoint, would YC be unable to imagine ‘the black breath’ of the Judaean desert darkening the sun over Jerusalem and its vicinity?.","date":"2013-08-05","mins":"6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40344","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: (too rapidly for the popliteal fossae to be correctly recorded and 3 D encoded)..","date":"2013-08-03","mins":"11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40419","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder for Yannick: On June 1, 2013 at 2:20 pm | #18 Reply |, I wrote: “As far as the TS image is concerned, on one hand, the bloody body image is first and foremost readable as old archaeological bloodstain patterns and thus shall be studied in the light of a specific burial by an archaeological bloodstain pattern analyst, a Second Temple period archaeologist and/or a forensic archaeologist.” On June 1, 2013 at 11:54 am | #9 Reply |, I also wrote: “the thread (on the TS man blood issue) was sort of spoiled by YC’s received and most biased ideas (as the latter does seem totally enable to discriminate between: 1/nearly 2000 years’ old archaeological blood vs. Dry stains of relatively fresh one; 2/a biochemist and an archaeological bloodstain pattern analyst; 3/a surgeon and a forensic palaeopathologist/archeaologist) to say nothing of his pathologically irrelevant “hypergraphic” comments on Zugibe’s opinion (as the latter’s voice as forensic expert was just one among several others) and YC’s shameless knack for distorting or ignoring others’ interpretation while having misleadingly the dead speak (e.g. Adler, Rogers and Barbet) through recurring ad nauseam to “the silence argument.” “Adler’s finding (that still needs to be independently confirmed) doesn’t prove beyond the shadow of a rational doubt the TS man’s bloody body was not purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial practice.

No problem, he keeps claiming Yeshua’s burial was dispatched in less than half an hour implying Joseph of Arimathea waited to the very last minute to buy a burial cloth and then ask Pilate for his master’s body just before sunset? Nope.” Additional reminders for YC: On March 17, 2012 (that is more than one year ago) I wrote: “(YC) currently keeps rehashing Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was made in haste after sunset (that is within about half an hour or so) and his shroud just draped about his body or loosely bound for the women to wash and anoint his body at the first morning hour of the first day of the Hebrew week, that is just after the Shabbat, on the third day of Yeshua’s death. Such a view (or should I better say “preaching”) presupposes: 1/Yossef Ha Ramathayim (both a member of the Sanhedrin/Judean Supreme Court and a secret disciple of Rabbi Yeshua), waited until shqiya/sunset (18:08/18:38 p.m.) that is a minimum of 3 hours AFTER his master’s violent death on the Golgotha (at 15:04/15:34 p.m.) BEFORE he actually went to Pilate’s and ask him for Yeshua’s body and then bought a linen shroud to bury him. Are you serious? Do you really think Yossef Ha Ramatayim would have also run the risk not to abide by Deuteronomy 21: 22 23 and wait to the very last minute for taking down himself or having Rabbi Yeshua’s body be taken down from the cross and buried? It does seem you totally overlook “one little circumstantial fact”: in the Second Temple period, any working activity was to stop at midday “on preparation day” that is on the very eve of the great Shabbat of Pessa H/Passover (Pessa H 4, V). How then could possibly Joseph of Aramathia have bought a shroud after sunset and before dusk on that specific day when Jerusalem weavers’ workshops, stores and shops had all been closed for more than 6 6½ hours? This is a total exegetical non sense. Unless one is ignorant of the ethnic milieu and thinks a Judean of the Second Temple period would have waited until sunset on “preparation day” and go and buy a shroud long after all the weaver’s workshops and linen shops had closed, this reconstruction of the event chronology is most unlikely. In all likelihood, Yossef Ha Ramathaym had already bought a fine linen shroud for himself in anticipation of his own death and used it to wrap Yeshua’s body “with his shed innocent blood”. As a disciple of Yeshua, didn’t Yossef go as far as using his own recently hewn garden tomb near by to bury his master executed as a criminal and thus to both abide by Sanhedrin 6: 46b and spare some precious time to proceed to his burial? [Precision: the women bought the spices not just BEFORE but just AFTER the sabbatical rest. Mark (16: 1) raises the ambiguity which could result from the chronologically biased relation/presentation of the same fact in Luke (23: 56).] 2/ Modern time markers such as ‘evening’, ‘sunset’, ‘twilight dusk’ philologically cover the same realities for a Judean of the Second Temple period. Far from it! With respect to the time frame for Yeshua’s burial, here are the ancient biblical Hebrew words & expressions for the time markers from noon to night used in the Second Temple period yet currently overlooked by Shroud researchers/old students and exegetes: 1/Tsot ha yom (or “midday”) refers to that time of the day at equal distance between sunset and sunrise. 2/Tsohorayim (dual form of Tsohar, “dazzling light” or “zenith”) literally means “two dazzling lights” or “two zeniths” and refers to ‘both morning and evening lights’ merging into ‘noon’. 3/Erev (“evening”) may indifferently refer to the 1st or the 2nd evening. Rabbi Yeshua died exactly between the first and the second evening (at the 9th hour). 4/Beyn ha arbayim literally means “between the two evenings,” — arbayim being the dual form of erev, “evening.” The afternoon was divided into two halves: from noon to mid afternoon and from mid afternoon to sunset or put in other words from early to late evening (See Exodus 29:38 41, “They shall slaughter it [the paschal lamb]… beyn ha arbayim”). For the covenant people, the entire day revolved around the offering of the two Tamid lambs: that of the morning and that of the evening. “In a paper entitled « En Vue de la Solution Archéologique de l’Énigme » I presented in Turin in 1998, I wrote: « Le deuxième sacrifice quotidien du Temple (Numbers 28: 4 8) dit sacrifice du “soir” (evening sacrifice) se déroulait vers le milieu de l’après midi (mid afternoon) et pouvait être avancé d’une heure (une veille de Pâque) voire même de deux heures (lorsque cette grande fête tombait un Shabbat) (Pessa H 5:1). Le premier sacrifice avait lieu le matin. Ainsi “le premier soir” allait il du milieu du jour (from midday) jusqu’à la deuxième immolation en milieu d’après midi (until mid afternoon) et, « le deuxième soir », de la deuxième immolation du milieu d’après midi (from mid afternoon) jusqu’au crépuscule du soir (until twilight/dusk)».”. 5/Shqiya, “sunset”; the sun set at 18:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and 18:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. 6/Beyn ha shemashot which literally means “between the suns” is an expression for “dusk” or “twilight” between the setting sun and the rising moon (which reflects the light of the sun). 7/Layla, “night”; typically layla is taken to be when you can see three stars in the sky in reference to tset ha kokhavim, the first “three stars coming out” to announce a new day (here the great Shabbat of Pessa H). The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and19:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. Owing to a lunar eclipse or the Ruah Qadīm, “east wind” (Khamsin/Sharav); a wind blowing from the desert of Judea, the whole city of Jerusalem was plunged into darkness from tsohorayim (“noon”) to beyn ha arbayim (“between the two evenings” that is the 9th hour of the day; 15.34 p.m. On April 7 30 CE/ 15.04 p.m. On April 3 33 CE). In other words, for 3h34/3h04, on the very day Rabbi Yeshua died on the cross, it was also night, “layla” on that very day in the eye of a Judean of the Second Temple period. Hence, the actual maximum time frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. Within a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s buriers had enough time to pre wash his body (i.e. To re dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. Sindôn/Heb. Sadin) soaked with a watery solution (ashes of the Red Heifer?) and tightly wrap it up, with fresh aromatic medical insect repellent plants, in linen clothes and strips. In the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three days immediately following his burial. Anointment was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite as it allowed preventing bad smells on those subsequent visits. Because this part of the rite was not done, the women had to buy and prepare spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the third day. They definitely had not to wash the deceased’s naked body at all but just to anoint his linen wrappings. Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period might well have been duly completed within a minimum of a two hours and a half time frame.” On March 24, 2012, I also wrote: “Both historically and archaeoastronomically speaking, here is the best alternative to account for the darkening of the sun on Yeshua’s death on the cross: Either it did actually happen one “April 7th of 30 CE” and if so, the “black breath” of the Ruah qâdim (“east wind”, also called Sharav/Khamsin), blowing from the desert of Judea, is the most likely phenomenon to have occurred to account for the darkening of the sun. Or it did actually happen one “April 3rd of 33 CE” and if so, the same “black breath” or dust tempest has been followed by the rising of a moon already bloody/in eclipse that evening/second evening, thus fulfilling Joel’s prophetical “blood moon” vision (Joel 2:31).” This is my hypergraphic answer to YC hypergraphic prose..","date":"2013-08-04","mins":"6:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40420","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"(Better post my #96 post here, at the end of the thread) Reminder for Yannick: On June 1, 2013 at 2:20 pm | #18 Reply |, I wrote: “As far as the TS image is concerned, on one hand, the bloody body image is first and foremost readable as old archaeological bloodstain patterns and thus shall be studied in the light of a specific burial by an archaeological bloodstain pattern analyst, a Second Temple period archaeologist and/or a forensic archaeologist.” On June 1, 2013 at 11:54 am | #9 Reply |, I also wrote: “the thread (on the TS man blood issue) was sort of spoiled by YC’s received and most biased ideas (as the latter does seem totally enable to discriminate between: 1/nearly 2000 years’ old archaeological blood vs. Dry stains of relatively fresh one; 2/a biochemist and an archaeological bloodstain pattern analyst; 3/a surgeon and a forensic palaeopathologist/archeaologist) to say nothing of his pathologically irrelevant “hypergraphic” comments on Zugibe’s opinion (as the latter’s voice as forensic expert was just one among several others) and YC’s shameless knack for distorting or ignoring others’ interpretation while having misleadingly the dead speak (e.g. Adler, Rogers and Barbet) through recurring ad nauseam to “the silence argument.” “Adler’s finding (that still needs to be independently confirmed) doesn’t prove beyond the shadow of a rational doubt the TS man’s bloody body was not purified in accordance with an ancient (Judean) burial practice.

The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and19:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. Owing to a lunar eclipse or the Ruah Qadīm, “east wind” (Khamsin/Sharav); a wind blowing from the desert of Judea, the whole city of Jerusalem was plunged into darkness from tsohorayim (“noon”) to beyn ha arbayim (“between the two evenings” that is the 9th hour of the day; 15.34 p.m. On April 7 30 CE/ 15.04 p.m. On April 3 33 CE). In other words, for 3h34/3h04, on the very day Rabbi Yeshua died on the cross, it was also night, “layla” on that very day in the eye of a Judean of the Second Temple period. Hence, the actual maximum time frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30” left for Yeshua’s burial time frame burial as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. Within a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s buriers had enough time to pre wash his body (i.e. To re dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. Sindôn/Heb. Sadin) soaked with a watery solution (ashes of the Red Heifer?) and tightly wrap it up, with fresh aromatic medical insect repellent plants, in linen clothes and strips. In the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three days immediately following his burial. Anointment was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite as it allowed preventing bad smells on those subsequent visits. Because this part of the rite was not done, the women had to buy and prepare spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the third day. They definitely had not to wash the deceased’s naked body at all but just to anoint his linen wrappings. Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period might well have been duly completed within a minimum of a two hours and a half time frame.” On March 24, 2012, I also wrote: “Both historically and archaeoastronomically speaking, here is the best alternative to account for the darkening of the sun on Yeshua’s death on the cross: Either it did actually happen one “April 7th of 30 CE” and if so, the “black breath” of the Ruah qâdim (“east wind”, also called Sharav/Khamsin), blowing from the desert of Judea, is the most likely phenomenon to have occurred to account for the darkening of the sun. Or it did actually happen one “April 3rd of 33 CE” and if so, the same “black breath” or dust tempest has been followed by the rising of a moon already bloody/in eclipse that evening/second evening, thus fulfilling Joel’s prophetical “blood moon” vision (Joel 2:31).” This is my hypergraphic answer to YC hypergraphic prose.

Nope..","date":"2013-08-04","mins":"7:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40508","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"YC, 1/Could you give me the name of a REALLY INSPIRED biblical scholar, please and tell me what does he say about the darkness at crucifixion (if you know any such Biblical scholar!). 2/Could you account for your sudden dismissing of the Occam razor principle as far as the darkness at crucifxion is concerned? 3/How can you be so sure such a literay device was applied in 100% cases as far as the Biblical texts are concerned? 4/ What about ‘the ninth hour’ according to your pious lie/literay forgery so called theory?

In his eponymic gospel, he reports Peter’s testimony. Now Peter was also a direct witness of the darkness. Most likely Luke (Heb. Yair, mistranslated in Greek by iatros) helped Yeshua to carry his cross (beam) and as such was also a direct witness of the darkness. Matthew was not only a Roman tax collector but also a Judean and one of Yeshua’s disciples and report there were darkness. We have 3 4 direct witness for the darkness at the crucifixion. Reminder of YC’s claimed opinion (on this very thread) for YC himself: Re darkness at the crucifixion, when YOU CLAIMED as if it were a proven fact it was “NOTHING ELSE THAN (upper case letters mine) A SYMBOLICAL MANNER for the Gospel writers to say that it was the hours of the darkness powers and that God was about to begin a brand new creation”… YES, I am100% sure you are totally wrong just because YOURSELF claimed “THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW.”! Reminder AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN for YC: I NEVER say, as you most misleadingling infer, I was 100% sure there was darkness at the crucifixion. Don’t you but the words in my mouth. I just said “IT WAS MOST LIKELY”. I would say I am 95% sure if we take into account – severeal direct witnesses DID produce valid testimonies in the light of the Judean law system and their testimonies just cannot be as easily overlooked as you most wrongly think. Judean law system is part and parcel of the Judean culture. – the Judean desert dust storm is a factual datum. It would account for “a storm” in conjunction with “darkness” as it does blow in Jerusalem and its vicinity and/or ‘lontanicity’ (“all over the land” of Judaea or as far as the eye could reach from the mount Golgotha). Meteorological phenomena is also part and parcel of the Judean culture. Reminder ACAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN for YC: MOST LIKELY (95%), this was BOTH a physical darkness AND a sign as far as Yeshua’s crucifixion are concerned. In other words, MOST LIKELY the darkness at the crucifixion war DRAMATIC AND FACTUAL as it is totally consistent with a Judean desert dust storm of great magnitude (remember for e.g. March 1998 dust storm blowing in Jerusalem and its vicinity) and the several direct witnesses’ testimonies are in accordance with legal validity as far as the Judean/Jewish law system is concerned. MOST LIKELY THIS IS MORE THAN A MERE LITERAY DEVICE IN TERMS OF DRAMATIC EMPHASIS. Oftentimes, Yeshua’s resurrection itself is also seen by Christians BOTH as A FACT (several direct witnesses bore testimonies they saw Yeshua alive after his death) and a SIGN (as a new covenant between G.od and Manhood).

He also did overlook they took the cloak off, most likely causing some of his wounds to exude again, put “his (dry) woollen seamless tunic, woven in one piece”, upon his re exuding wound covered body and carried him to Golgotha (= most likely the tunic more or less stuck to most of his wounds).

The true fact is the presence of solid objects, medical plants and flower heads laterally pressed against the body together with the presence of “small bridges” between body and inner burial cloth could account for truncated panoramicity. The latter doesn’t preclude a tightly wrapped body front and back at all. Finally you asked me “How can you account for the fact that these scourge wounds too have been able to leave a pretty good imprint on the cloth? It’s pretty evident for me that these particular wounds on the legs were NOT stuck to the tunic after the carrying of the cross?” Most likely his buriers also wrapped around his bleeding pierced feet and lower part of the legs from about the knees with an additional pre burial cloth when they took down the body from the cross..","date":"2013-08-01","mins":"5:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"id":"comment-40343","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"To Yannick (playing his old trick of shirking the point on me too by claiming not to understand my point as far as the sticking unsticking process is concerned): Re evidence of the sticking unsticking process in relation to the Turin Shroud (TS) bloody body image, the exception proves the rule: At one and the same time and at popliteal fossa level (the knees being in partially flexed position), Miller and Pellicori UV photos do show that there are scourge marks and yet no (or next to no) body image (this in conjunction with an air gap).

AN ARCHAEOPERCETIVE SOLUTION for experiencing a “sindonopareidolia ”/Shroud like semblance information decoding of the gridiron with small wheels and a rampant fire raging underneath (Gallia Placida Mausoleum Mosaic of Saint Lawrence, early 5th c.

First fold up the long cloth four times onto itself widthwise to get a rectangle about 22cm wide x 444cm long and 5 layers; then twice onto itself lengthwise to get a shorter rectangle about 22cm wide x 222cm long and 10 layers and finally nine times onto itself lengthwise to get a square about 22cx22cm and 100 layers. Place a weight on top of it. After a length of time of about 24 hours, take off the weight and carefully unfold the folded cloth. The whole surface of the latter shall appear marked with 100 squares. Now contemplate in primary vision and in conjunction with Saint Lawrence’s or Saint Vincent’s martyrdom. You get your gridiron. Keep the mental semblance or pareidoliac part 1 in store. 4/ Now contemplate the 4 symmetrical series of burn holes in conjunction with the 4 small somehow rounded water stains. Place the cloth flat on a slab or table 180cm long x 55cm wide so as to have the 4 L shaped burn holes each in conjunction with a rounded water stains hang down form the four table/slab corners. Now contemplate the view of the 2 dorsal image L shaped burn holes each in conjunction with its rounded water stain hanging down form the 2 table/slab corners. From your mental storage, get the semblance of the gridiron in. Now you get your gridiron with small wheels.

In the hypothesis the shroud is Rabbi Yeshua’s, this is IN BLATANT CONTRADICTION with John’s Gospel. The fact is the latter was first fastened/tightly wrapped into LINEN SHEETS. Most probably, the long inner shroud soaked with a watery solution GRADUALLY LOOSENED UP while it was subjected to a myrrho aleotic fumigation hence your misthinking the inner shroud was just loosely draped over.” AGAIN on January 20, 2012 at 11:38 am | #16 YOU WROTE: “The fact that the Shroud was probably loosely draped over the body come from the study done by Jackson, Ercoline and Al. And also another study done by Mario Latendresse concerning possible distortions present in the images and the way the cloth could have been draped over the body. The most probable way the cloth was draped during the image formation process, if I base my judgement on those 2 studies, is loosely draped without being tied up with linen strips. That’s my perception after having read those 2 studies.” I have kept telling you the sindon was FIRST tightly wrapped up/compressed and THEN loosenened up (through the drying up ritual).

Both shall be put in the right perspective. In the light of the Judean ethnic miileu of the Second Temple period, the inference is Yeshua’s buriers used a mixture of pulverized aloes wood and myrrh (i.e. A blend of one perfume and one spice) to fumigate his corpse (purifying & drying up ritual) and perfumed his “tomb bed”. On the 3rd day of Yeshua’s death, the aromatic/spicy ointment the women brought was intended to ONLY anoint Yeshua’s burial linen cloths/sheets as women would not have been entitled to anoint a male naked body!

Since you don’t seem to clearly get my point, allow me to remind you of Flury Lemberg’s “off centred primeval fold hypothesis” (which is still to be confirmed by independent analyses). In Sindone 2002 (Preservation, p.43), she wrote: “Only a few centimetres away on the left from the centre fold line a second, much more delicate, firmly impressed V shaped groove can be distinguished which also runs along the whole length of the cloth. I would like to call this the “primeval fold” as it belongs to the very first folding after the Shroud had been finished. Those folds are due to the production process of the fabric, they are not the result of using the fabric.” Now if we rely on Flury Lemberg’s observation and since the primeval fold is 6.2cm±0.5cm off centred, one can easily deduce the Shroud originally was 6.2cm±0.5cm wider than it is to day. The re sewn side strip being 9cm wide (7cm wide as it appears at first sight), then it would mean a second side strip 4 2cm±0.5cm might well have been cut off for burial purpose. Archaeologically speaking, it could then be an ALTERNATIVE to the “side strip hypothesis.

Most likely the Shroud was soaked in aqueous alkaline solution, tautly wrapped lengthwise as inner burial cloth and compressed widthwise with outer burial cloths to tightly wrap up the stiff rigid body. The shooting star shaped like diluted blood stain passive pattern off elbow is consistent with body resting in extra height on its left side and diluted blood pearling at elbow tip to be drained from the corpse to the fabric.

Christian Thinktank on the internet. Here is an extract: “A FULL burial included washing/anointing (done with spices, oils, and water), bindings (linen strips, with spices), shroud (recorded from the Synoptics), entombment, and sealing the tomb. [Actually, it looks more like a “some rite” burial, because of the quantity of spices and statue of the burial party–Joseph and Nicodemus.] This indicates that Jesus was buried–whether it was an honorable burial or not, whether in shame or not–in accordance with the already documented Jewish requirements. He was fully buried. The seven days of mourning–shiva–(in case it was NOT a dishonorable burial) would have begun when the tomb was closed. [Note: If the historical data leads us to believe that Jesus actually was considered to have died on the Cross that day, then we have every right to believe He was buried by nightfall–regardless of how we view the accuracy of the gospel accounts. The Jewish social/religious pressures to bury by nightfall insure us that (absent an entourage of people who wish to eulogize Jesus too long) He was buried that night. Accordingly, it is not ‘begging the question’ to assert that Jesus was buried. This can be confidently believed, irrespective of our confidence or non confidence in the gospel narratives, on the basis of Jewish custom/culture of the day… As for the gospel narratives, I consider the fact that the ‘operational’ or physical aspects of the burial (e.g., carry, anoint, wash, rock, etc) are not ‘theologized’, but are simply described, as indicating that these physical details are adequate historical data to work with. A secular historian might raise eyebrows at the quantity of spices, the sudden appearance of J of A, or the remark about “in which no one had been buried before”, but the “non interpreted” nature of the physical details in the narratives seems trustworthy enough to consider the description of the burial as being true to fact.] · “They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, according to the burial custom of the Jews” [John 19.40] · “The burial of the body was hasty and had to be completed before sundown. The process is uncertain. The spices, being of somewhat gummy character, may have been laid in the folds of the cloth to provide a rigid casing for the body, or they may have been ground and mixed with oil to form an ointment to rub on the body. The former procedure agrees better with the text. “Strips of linen” is a translation of othoniois. Later usage in the koine Greek made the term a generic equivalent of clothes (cf. MM, p. 439). In the case of Lazarus, the graveclothes were wrapped around him in such a way that he had to be released after he was raised.” [EBCNT, at John 19.40] · “Shroud. In Mt. 27:59 par Mk. 15:46; Lk. 23:53 sindoµn describes a linen cloth used for the wrapping of a dead body in preparation for burial. Jewish burial practices in NT times included washing and anointing the body, perhaps even after it had been earlier cleaned with oil and washed at the place of death (cf. Jn. 19:40) or in the deceased’s home. Anointing might be repeated in the tomb itself (cf. Mk. 16:1). The dead were then buried in their own clothes or specially prepared ones such as a simple linen cloth on which spices would be spread as the cloth was wound around the body. With regard to Jesus’ burial, the Synoptic Gospels all relate how Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of Jesus in a shroud. The Johannine account states that Joseph and Nicodemus followed “the burial custom of the Jews,” anointing the body with a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about 45 kgs. (100 lbs.) and binding it in “linen cloths” (Jn. 19:39f). Those “linen cloths” were found in the empty tomb on Easter morning along with a “napkin, which had been on his head,” which was “not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself” (20:6f). [ISBE, s.v. ‘shroud’] This data, of course, argues that Jesus was formally buried on Friday night–as the text says, and as the customs dictated. But what were the women planning to do, if Jesus was already buried? As far as the text indicates, they didn’t know what all Joseph/Nicodemus/burial tradesmen had done (some only watched from a distance initially–this makes sense if Joseph and Nicodemus were known Council members, yet unknown disciples of Jesus!). They might not have assumed that these Jewish leaders had performed all the anointing/washing. They did, however, see the tomb and ‘how the body was laid’ (Lk 23.55: “Now the women who had come with Him out of Galilee followed after, and saw the tomb and how His body was laid.”). But the text (Mr 16.1) only speaks of them wanting to ‘anoint’, not ‘wash’ him. This means they were aware that the core procedure of burial had been done. They probably were also intending on adding the personal touches, much as when a grieving parent wants to put a special toy into a casket, to put a special necklace on the deceased, or to straighten the clothes of a lost one. So they carried their spices and their grief, and went to be with the One who loved them… From the textual data, there is no reason to assume that they regarded the burial of Jesus as ‘uncompleted’ at all. They had seen the spices and perhaps saw the wrapping of the body, spoken of in John 19.40: “And so they (Joseph/Nicodemus/company) took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews”. But I am not trying here to address all the issues in the burial/resurrection accounts–just the ‘temporary tomb’ issue for now…so let me try to get back on track here… So, I think it’s very accurate to say that “temporary tomb” and “temporary burial” do NOT refer to ‘holding areas, prior to initial FULL burial’, from the standpoint of Semahot, Kloner, and the rabbinic literature.”.","date":"2013-02-22","mins":"11:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/19/on-the-topic-of-bloodstains-picking-up-threads-of-useful-discussion/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"On the Topic of Bloodstains: Picking up Threads of Useful Discussion"},{"id":"comment-25302","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Extract: “Preparing the body — Taharah There are three major stages to preparing the body for burial: washing (rechitzah), ritual purification (taharah), and dressing (halbashah).

And I probably missed a Y after the i. The right word for resurrection is Al Qi Yamah (القيامة). But that proves my point even more. The i Y is before the m (م)and when pronounced its very obvious, where Qimyyah (or more likely pronounce Al Kemiyah)( الكيمياء), the heavy i Y or double Y as you wrote it is after the m(م). I lived in Egypt till I was 27 years old. Believe me, I don’t need to brush up on my Arabic. Please try to communicate with somone else who speaks Arabic and they will tell you the same thing.

Mike M February 28, 2014 at 9:05 am | #52 Quote Yeah, I am sorry. I know that كيمياء in Arabic means chemistry. I didn’t know the ancient Egyptian root for it.

This is rather confusing. Don’t you misunderstand me. Methinks (كيمياء) ‘kimyâ’ just means “woman from The Black Country”. It derives from ‘khem,’ “the black country” to designate Egypt. The Egyptian woman is just an allegory for Alchemy. Another etymology traces the word back to the Greek ‘chyma,’ “to fuse or cast metal. My personal opinion is the word alchemy was coined from merging BOTH the Arabic word Al Qiyamah, “The Resurrection” AND the Egyptian word kimyâ, “Woman from the Black Country” (to be understood in the light of the cult of Black Virgins). Hence the neologism [Al Qimyyah] (written with a “Q” not a “K”) as the most likely etymology for the word Alchemy. Mike M February 28, 2014 at 8:32 pm | #54 Quote (…) I think the Etymology of Alchemy is based, as you mentioned, the Arabic word (الکیمیاء) Kimya meaning chemistry, without the need to merg it with (القيامة) arabic for resurrection (from the root of standing up) which I find to be very different in pronunciation.

The Egyptian words kem (< kimia) means black land (Egypt) in reference to the dark silty soil of the Nile delta and was associated with the Nile valley life as opposed to death/barren land of the desert. 'Sarah the Black One' is associated with Alchemy (spiritual alchemy as the art of shifting from darkness/ignorance to light/truth and therefore resurrection). \"But then again, why am I doing this trying to argue my original language with someone who doesn’t speak it and doesn’t listen.\" I got a few Arabic friends (two Syrians, one Palestinian, two Algerians, two Lebaneses) who do think I get along quite well in Arabic.

Besides the stylized monogram reading both SOT, “secret” in Hebrew and OST as initials for O S(ùdario de) T(urim), had you the initiated eye for secret references (in terms of the sculptor’s FREE interpretation of part of the bloodied body of the man of the Shroud), you could have noticed a few striking parallels (strong athletic build, head tilted forward, rope bound at trunk level, awkward position of the left leg placed in front of the semi flexed right leg, rope tied at left wrist level, hair in a poney tail etc).

Partial extreme compression of the face could account for the very faint partial “second blood image of the head” found by Fanti at the back of the cloth. Most likely the TS man’s dried blood heavy perspiration dust stiffened long hair side strands were hard like cardboard when the long Shroud was first tautly pulled up over the head lengthwise and then a smaller shroud (a face cloth or veil) was tightly wrapped up around widthwise along with a skull cap on top of it all to tightly close the long burial upper end. Thus most likely the corpse was tightly wrapped up in linen shroud S. Then it was placed in extra height –first on the right side then on the left side– to be subjected to a myrrhic aloetic fumigation to dry out. In the process the long inner body shroud (aka the TS) got sort of taut again through shrinking, which account for some of the resulting blood marks (resulting from thorn punctures of the temple and forehead) seen on the face and hair to have been originally on the cheek (geometric distortion most likely due to shrinking up while getting sort of taut at one and the same time at face level).
