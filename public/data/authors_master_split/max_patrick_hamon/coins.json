[…]Maybe. I don’t know.” –There is no ‘maybe’ as the TRUE fact is most definitely, IT IS NOT. (Your opinion is biased as long as you ONLY rely on NON professional numismatists, NON archaeological/ancient bloodstained pattern analysts, NON archaeological image analysts/cryptanalysts and NON palaeographers such as Lynn, Gonella and Schwortz who most obviously confuse NON body tiny blood images with body images). –Rodante’s and Moroni’s experiments DO prove that (via blood transfer) a 3:1 twill linen fabric (soaked with a watery/oily solution) such as the TS is not too coarse to record small/Pilate coin partial patterns. To assert it is too coarse to record such patterns is totally misleading and nothing less than a pseudo scientific and pseudo archaeological untruth. Secondly, “Is the nature of the film inadequate? Maybe. I don’t know.” –Which film/picture of the Sindon face close up are you referring to? The TRUE fact is the same intriguing tiny patterns do appear (more or less out of focus) whatever the photographic procedure not only in 1931 Enrie’s (orthochromatic) and 1978 Miller’s (traditional silver) but also in 2002 Durante’s (extensive digital). The intriguing tiny patterns may completely or partially disappear only under specific lighting conditions. –To assert that the nature of the film is inadequate in se is to ignore the same intriguing tiny patterns DO appear on genuine Sindon face photographs whatever the photographic procedure. Then Dan you added: “My problem is perception.” –I have no doubt about it since it is a very tricky case we have here. As a final comment you wrote: “I suspect that some of us have different, indeterminable acceptance thresholds where I think I see becomes I see.” –When e.g. It comes to “ancient coin PARTIAL TINY pattern recognition”, it is even more tricky for the uninitiated brain and eye system as the latter may be not only the victim of ‘I think I sees’ (i.e. Falsely positive perceptions) BUT ALSO ‘I think I don’t sees’/‘I don’t think I sees’ (i.e. Falsely negative perceptions) AND misreading (fragmented letters, letter sequences or image) AND even a mixture of falsely positive perceptions, falsely negative perceptions and misreading. So much for the “different, indeterminable acceptance thresholds” where I think I see becomes I see, I don’t think I see/I think I don’t see becomes I don’t see, I think I don’t read becomes I don’t read, I misread becomes I read etc. –The TRUE fact is the Pilate coin pattern recognition issue is completely spoiled by such biased approaches by NON professional numismatists, NON archaeological/ancient bloodstained pattern analysts, NON archaeological image/inscription/text analysts/cryptanalysts and NON palaeographers. –Di Lazzaro, Murra & Schwortz’s paper is brilliantly desinformative as it ONLY tackles/sees ‘ONE side of the issue’ as far as pareidolia is concerned. The FACT is It only tackles the ‘I think I see [what is not really there]’ side but most misleadingly overlooks to tackle/see the TWO OTHER sides of the optical illusion issue namely ‘I think I don’t see/I don’t think I see [what is really there] and falsely positive perceptions mixed with falsely negative ones in conjunction or not with misreading. –It is now up to the professional numismatist, palaeographer/epigraphist and/or archaeological image analyst/cryptanalyst (ideally working in close association with an optic engineer) to REALLY help the uninitiated eye to see what is really not there and what is really there in terms e.g. Of partial tiny coin patterns or inscriptions around and on the TS face..","date":"2013-01-06","mins":"1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-21882","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Answer: IT CAN..","date":"2013-01-11","mins":"9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/06/paper-chase-why-there-are-probably-no-images-of-coins-lettering-flowers-and-whatnots-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Why There Are Probably No Images of Coins, Lettering, Flowers and Whatnots on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-21883","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Dave, you challenge me to “find you another example, if I’ve a point!”.
