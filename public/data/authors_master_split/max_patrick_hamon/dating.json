In my 2007 research paper on the TS C14 dating fiasco, I wrote: “Parmi ces quelques fils ou sections de fils provenant de cette zone plus sombre que forment le Coin de Raës et plus des deux tiers de l’échantillon C14 officiel, Rogers identifia, consolidé par l’enduit résineux, un fil ayant subi une épissure bout à bout de deux fils d’origines différentes. Des fibres de ce fil s’échappaient, en effet, de sa partie centrale et d’autres fibres situées à ses deux extrémités se trouvaient positionnées en sens inverse. Anomalie qui avait déjà été remarquée en 1988 sur le seul et unique fil qu’examina au microscope le Pr Edward Hall du Laboratoire d’Oxford (Cette anomalie, pourtant elle aussi avérée, n’a pas non plus été évoquée lors de la toute dernière communication de Madame Metchild Flury Lemberg. On ne peut que le regretter). I also wrote about the 1982 unofficial attempt at radiocarbon dating the TS: “Comme beaucoup de gens encore aujourd’hui, ils (Tite et al) ignoraient qu’en 1982, un minéralogiste de renommée mondiale, le Pr George R. Rossman du laboratoire de l’Institut Technologique de la Californie (« Caltech ») à Pasa dena, avait déjà procédé d’une façon non officielle, à un test radiocarbone sur la relique. Le micro échantillon daté en secret6 avait consisté en un seul et unique fil d’environ 8 cm tiré à partir de la zone de l’échantillon semi triangulaire7 prélevé, en 1973, par le Pr Gilbert Raës ; zone jouxtant celle précisément où avait été extrait l’échantillon C14 officiel. Le fil dont une partie était apparue enduite d’une couche superficielle plus sombre avait été coupé en deux. On avait alors abouti, pour le même fil, à une datation à deux extrémités encore plus hétérogènes que celle obtenue en 1988 par les trois autres laboratoires : le I Ie siècle pour la partie apparemment non contaminée et le XI Ie siècle pour l’autre partie pourtant décontaminée (soit un différentiel de mille années !). Rossman ne publia jamais son résultat. En 1988 tout comme en 1982, le principe même de la datation par la méthode éprouvée du radiocar bone ne pouvait être mis en cause. Pas plus qu’on ne pouvait douter du sérieux avec lequel furent, à chaque fois, effectuées les mesures de la teneur en radiocarbone surtout lorsqu’on sait qu’en 1988 les diverses phases de la procédure classique de mesure furent doublées voire même triplées pour certains des microéchantillons lors de mesures d’essai. Que des microéchantillons provenant de la même aire du drap puissent refléter cinq points diffé rents dans le temps (le X Ve, XI Ve, XII Ie, XI Ie et I Ie siècle de notre ère), permet de conclure, de toute évidence, non pas à des erreurs aléatoires (hasard statistique ou approximations commises au cours de l’analyse) mais à une erreur systématique due à l’hétérogénéité des échantillons testés. En d’autres termes, cela signifie que toute cette série de datations 14 C erratiques du même objet ne pouvaient être dû qu’à un prélèvement d’échantillons de provenance douteuse et à la non élimination de carbones plus récents malgré les traitements physiques et chimiques de nettoyage employés par lesdits laboratoires. En fonction de la valeur réelle du test du khi2 (valeur faussée dans le rapport officiel, 5 pour 1,04), il existe très exactement pas moins de 98,96 chances sur 100 pour que les différences des dates moyennes entre les 3 laboratoires soient dues au manque d’homogénéité du matériel daté en 1988. Selon le physicien en radiocarbone français Jacques Évin, pour concilier la date historiquement possible du Ier siècle avec la fameuse datation en âge moyen de 1260 1390, (soit avec la mesure radiocarbone 663 ± 65 années avant la date de référence de 1988), « l’échantillon atypique idéal » devrait avoir été formé, d’un poids de carbone moderne égal au poids de carbone du lin originel ou bien, dit autrement, être composé à 50% de fibres de 1858 1988 et à 50% de fibres du Ier siècle de notre ère parfaitement mêlés. D’après une autre estimation par le physicien américain John Jackson, il était possible que cette proportion fut de deux tiers/un tiers8 (66% 33%).” 2/Statistical sleigh of hand (Reminder) As a foot note: “Annoncé officiellement à 5 % (soit juste le seuil de validité admis), le niveau de signification (ou degré de cohérence) des résultats interlaboratoires, une fois recalculé, s’avéra être totalement faux. Il était, en fait, de 1,04 % c’est à dire bien en dessous du seuil critique impliquant, soit qu’une erreur systématique avait été commise au cours de l’analyse (ce qui n’était pas le cas) soit que l’échantillon n’était pas homogène (ce qui était précisément le cas). Ainsi, “par obligation de résultat”, Mme Sheridan Bowman, la responsable de la partie statistique de l’expérience, avait elle « arrondi » ce chiffre de 1,04% » à 5%. On ne peut que regretter cet excès de zèle par complaisance envers son patron, le Dr Michael Tite. Celui ci n’avait, en effet, jamais fait mystère qu’il ne croyait pas à l’authenticité du Linceul de Turin.” It just seem the recurrent presence of spliced threads (coton with linen) found in the TS Raes C14 corner and Tite and Bowman’s gross statistical sleigh of hand are just anecdotal pieces of evidence in Hugh’s eyes….","date":"2015-03-10","mins":"5:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-193025","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder for Hugh: since three tiny postage stamp size samples were used, to skew the radiocarbon date of the TS by a thousand years, doesn’t require a huge QUANTITY of the dated material to be of a later date, about 40% if the contamination is pure carbon, about 60 66% if the contamination is 19th CE cotton (most likely 19th century microreconstructions either by the princess Clothilde of Savoy Bonaparte or the Master of upholstery in the Royal court of Savoy, in 1863 or 1868).

When studied in the light of the Gospels, the Oral Torah (see tractates Semahot, Sanhedrin, Pessah and Sabbath), the Judean burial customs and practices of the Second Temple period (mostly pre 70 CE Judaism History & Archaeology), archaeoastronomy (to determine the exact burial minimum & maximum time frames for Yeshua’s emergency burial on a Sabbath eve), philology (to take into account Hebrew time markers; Hebrew & Greek action & object markers), ancient textiles, paleopathology and archaeological blood pattern analysis, all points to one naturalistic/ritualistic direction and nothing to the contrary: an “(absolo)vaporographic mordanting” based on gradual linen cloth to body loss of direct contact mechanism. This most likely burial scenario to be tested and control via a very specific archaeological experiment implies the following: First, Yeshua’s naked body (still in hypothermia at 41 42° C?) covered in dried or drying bloody wounds and resting in extra height on two stones in the tomb antechamber, was tautly wrapped lengthwise in a lengthy burial sheet of fine linen (or inner shroud) soaked with an alkaline solution (warm waters mixed with the ashes of the Red Heifer and/or rich in Jerusalem limestone?) and then his legs and torso compressed/fastened widthwise, with fresh antiseptic insect repellent aromatic plants (together with a prayer shawl used as shorter shroud?), in two long strips first cut off/torn off from the main burial sheet and a shorter strip and/or a gauze veil to tie around the head (together with three wooden pieces — cut off/sawed off the Titulus crucis? — to be used as a “small jaw box” to make up for a faulty skullcap?). Once his body was thus tightly wrapped up in linen, it was subjected to myrrhic aleotic fumigation and left to dry up first on its left and then right side. Finally, his tightly wrapped up body was taken down to the tomb chamber and placed in supine position inside the sole funerary niche on a bed of blended myrrh and aloes to keep it from putrefying and the burial cave entrance sealed by a large stone disc. [In anticipation of honorary visits, his linen wrappings were to be anointed with the perfumed spicy oils the women had prepared immediately after the Sabbath and brought at the first hour of the first day of the Judean week (Sunday) to mask the stench of his decomposing corpse. However the anointing was not done as they found the tomb empty of Yeshua’s body on that very day] In fraternitas sindonis.","date":"2012-04-06","mins":"5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"},{"id":"comment-10063","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"+++ correction: “got TAUT again” (sorry).","date":"2012-04-07","mins":"9:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"},{"id":"comment-10006","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Correction: “in HYPE Rthermia”.","date":"2012-04-06","mins":"5:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"},{"id":"comment-10064","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"“Got taut again through shrinking”.","date":"2012-04-07","mins":"9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"},{"id":"comment-10080","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Miguel Lorente Acosta MD, Ph D, Forensic Doctor, University of Granada wrote about “Body Temperature” in conjunction with the Turin shroud wrote: “The human being is a homoeothermic animal that maintains its temperature due to a set of exothermic processes. When death occurs and these processes come to a stop, a progressive cooling of the body (already a corpse) begins until the body temperature matches the ambient temperature. This gradual process is known as cadaveric cooling or algor mortis. The decrease of a corpse’s temperature takes place after a certain amount of time. At first, there is a plateau of thermal balance that can last up to two hours, and after that, the temperature decreases progressively. Sometimes this evolution goes through a phase of hyperthermia, an increase rather than a decrease of the corpse’s temperature, but this only happens in extraordinary situations provoked by certain causes of death. In the case of the studies of the Shroud of Turin, the evaluation of body temperature is only an indirect element that may have helped the formation of the image, as it facilitates the diffusion of the products from the contact (weft) side to the external (warp) side. The existence of hyperthermia would have helped the diffusion of the products and contributed to creating a delimitated and photographic image, since it would have acted along with the sweat produced by the sympathetic activation of shock which, due to its own composition and to the presence of other products derived from the blood, would have contributed to the formation of the image on the Shroud with the characteristics that we can observe today. If Jesus had died of traumatic shock with an important hypovolemic component and with the multiple wounds distributed throughout, – especially if we keep in mind that the body was taken to the tomb, a cold and humid hollow in a rock, late in the afternoon, and that it was washed – the body’s temperature when it came into contact with the linen must have been inferior to average body temperature. This would have made the diffusion of the degradation products and the formation of the image on the side of the linen that did not come into direct contact with the body rather difficult. If, as we have discussed, he had not yet been dead, his physiopathological characteristics would have more than likely caused a hyperthermia that would have contributed to the formation of the images that we can observe on the Shroud.” Hyperthermia is not “a must” within the economy of the scenario I propose. However, it just cannot be totally ruled out. Besides this possible internal heating source, the use of warm waters together with body aleotic/myrrhic aloetic fumigation, as external heating sources might well account for maintaining an elevated body temperature..","date":"2012-04-07","mins":"12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"},{"id":"comment-10144","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Note: As he is neither a paleopathologist nor a forensic archaeologist familiar with Late Antique crucifixion theme, a forensic doctor has a mostly theoretical and incomplete knowledge of crucifixion victims to say nothing of pre 70 CE Judean burial practices and customsl.

In the miniature, the whole pigtail can be made out from top to tip as it appears slightly darker and longer in the hair flow. ●Both have arm(s) bound and/or crossed in front. Had both no scourged and/or furrow marks on the inner side arms? This cannot be checked today any longer. ●Both have bloodied furrow and/or scourged marks in conjunction with two whips with lashes each fitted with doubled pellets implying two executioners. ●Both have almost feminine curved left hip & thigh (later to be called “the Byzantine curve”). In the miniature the pelvis is shown three quarters as a mishmash of the TS frontal and dorsal images. ●Both are/were tied at frontal tibiofibular level with left leg in front of right leg (TS man accurate Forensic description from both frontal and dorsal views: left leg in front of right leg with rope marking in the tibiofibular fleshes). ●Both show a most unnatural/awkward feet position as the three quarter back view stark naked Christ like figure being flogged in the miniature combines the TS dorsal and frontal images to be readable. ●And last but not least, by means of a very intriguing tailed Epsilon hand sign each time formed with unnaturally curved fingers, the executioner on the left seem to point with his left hand index finger to his own head while the executioner on the right does point to Christ’s head with his left hand index finger too.

Si l’échantillon carbone 14 officiel, fut choisi loin (et encore pas si loin) de tout rapiéçage visible et de toute zone carbonisée, deux imprudences « de taille » perçaient cependant dans cette première procédure mise en place. Pour savoir si l’on se trouvait ou non en présence d’un échantillon typique du Linceul, une information fondamentale sur la structure de son lin originel aurait due impérativement être vérifiée in situ par les deux experts textiles chargés de superviser le prélèvement de 1988 : celle de la normalité de ses irrégularités de tissage. Pour ce faire, il eut été nécessaire de procéder, sous un éclairage rasant et en fluorescence UV, à une observation minutieuse à la loupe, au compte fil et à la binoculaire non seulement des abords mais aussi au niveau même du cœur du site de prélèvement de l’échantillon carbone 14 afin de lever toute ambiguïté possible en ce domaine. On négligea totale ment cette dernière précaution. Or, tel qu’il apparaît sous fluorescences UV et sous éclairage rasant, – et donc tel que ne le virent jamais les deux experts textiles –, le fragment prélevé empiétait, par le bas sur une grande auréole d’eau dentelée vestige de l’incendie de 15329 tout en mordant en plein, dans deux aires hautement suspectes de réparations. Abstraction faite des zones carbonisées, la première de ces deux aires, au cinquième à cheval sur le pli barrant à la verticale le site de prélèvement, offrait, un aspect nettement plus raide et plus sombre que sur tout le reste de la surface du drap. Il s’agissait ici soit d’un dépôt de salissures graisseuses résultant des nombreuses manipulations de ce coin de la toile, soit d’une teinture locale destinée à camoufler, selon l’art des tapissiers, une restauration à l’identique de la texture, soit des deux. Dans la seconde aire plus claire et à droite de ce même pli et à gauche d’un pli courbe, on pouvait distinguer tout aussi nettement une anomalie structurelle : comme un réseau de fils plus dense de forme serpentine caractéristique d’une zone d’accroc ou de cisaillage ayant fait l’objet de micro reprises. Vues dans ces conditions très particulières d’observation, cette pollution et ces anomalies d’aspect ne sauraient être confondues avec une simple ombre portée, un pli du tissu ou bien une irrégularité normale apparue au cours du tissage10. Ainsi, dès le départ, la validité du résultat final se retrouva t elle être très sérieusement hypothéquée. De toute évidence, les deux experts textiles, les représentants des trois laboratoires et le coordinateur du projet n’étant pas des spécialistes du Linceul de Turin, ignoraient que dans sa composition matérielle même, la relique s’avère beaucoup plus complexe qu’il n’y paraît à première vue. Il faut, en effet, savoir que, lors des ostensions et afin de garantir aux observateurs présents la vision la plus parfaite et la plus logique de la double empreinte du Crucifié, la relique était déployée entièrement à l’horizon tale. Une bande de couture bourrelée courant sur toute sa longueur avait été confectionnée permettant une meilleure préhension du drap. L’échantillon parent, extrait d’un seul tenant entre 8 à 10 cm du bord supérieur du coin gauche et le long de la couture de repli du tissu sur lui même, se superposait donc presque parfaitement à la zone où – depuis au moins le XI Ve siècle et jusqu’au XI Xe siècle – la grande étoffe de lin avait été tenue en tenaille entre le creux de la paume et trois ou quatre des doigts de la main droite de plusieurs générations de dignitaires ecclésiastiques officiant à mains nues. Ainsi, à cet endroit très précis du drap, la toile, tantôt soumise à de fortes tensions et à des pressions répétées d’extrémités onglées plus ou moins coupantes, tantôt exposée aux griffures du chaton des bagues d’évêques et d’archevêques, avait elle fini, un jour, par être abrasée, accrochée, cisaillée et/ou trouée et faire l’objet d’une (voire même de plus d’une) microreconstruction(s) fil à fil invisible(s) à l’œil nu hors examen ad hoc. Or, pour dater correctement au carbone 14 un objet textile ancien – un étudiant en archéologie aurait pu le savoir –, il était tout sauf recommandé de prélever un seul et unique échantillon de tissu dans une telle zone. Il eut été beaucoup plus avisé et moins destructeur de procéder à un échantillonnage de quelques fils en plusieurs endroits beaucoup plus fiables en vue d’assurer, par intercomparaison, la représentativité de la datation.” There is nothing absurd at all about such a possibility..","date":"2013-10-07","mins":"5:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/03/and-then-too-we-have-two-comments-from-daveb-of-wellington/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"And then, too, we have two comments from Daveb of Wellington"},{"id":"comment-46406","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Still think it is not absurd at all when it comes to “pious Christian hands” (Princess Clothilde’s)….","date":"2013-10-07","mins":"6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/03/and-then-too-we-have-two-comments-from-daveb-of-wellington/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"And then, too, we have two comments from Daveb of Wellington"},{"id":"comment-48118","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Actually, I just would dream/love GENUINE Art Historians could made observations on the miniatures and/or my cryptanalysis….","date":"2013-10-20","mins":"10:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/20/an-intriguing-9th-century-image-suggestive-of-the-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-max-patrick-hamon/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Intriguing 9th Century Image Suggestive of the Shroud – A Guest Posting by Max Patrick Hamon"},{"id":"comment-46538","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Thibault, you understand well.

La technique dont il s’agit ici s’avère plus précisément celle d’un « retissage par épissures », sans coutures ni nœuds, effectuée, semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement. Elle demande beaucoup de patience et une grande dextérité des doigts. Elle consiste à mettre, tout d’abord, en place les fondations de base et la chaîne. Pour ce faire, soit le tisserand commence par identifier la matière des fibres constituant les fils de chaîne puis se les procure soit il utilise systématiquement des fibres de coton. Ensuite ces fibres sont filées afin d’obtenir l’épaisseur des fils originels puis entortillées avec précaution sur elles mêmes et sur place aux fibres des fils de chaîne extraites de la partie cachée du tissu à réparer. Des fils de remplacement de la trame sont alors placés par dessus et par dessous les fils de chaîne reconstitués puis les fibres sont entortillées sur elles mêmes, là encore avec précaution, aux fibres des fils de trame originels de façon à reproduire très exactement la texture ou le motif du tissu et refermer ainsi, sans faire de nœuds, le trou ou la zone sévèrement cisaillée. Pour finir de rendre cette restauration fil à fil tout à fait invisible et consolider les épissures, une teinture à base de gomme résineuse est appliquée localement sur la trame ainsi reconstruite pour que celle ci, d’où provient l’effet de texture ou de motif, se fonde dans l’original (en l’occurrence la toile jaunie par la patine ivoire des siècles). Cette intervention sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe, si elle est bien réalisée et bien dissimulée, peut réellement être invisible sur les deux faces d’une pièce d’étoffe au point d’échapper parfois même à la main et à l’œil exercés d’une personne du métier qui, à l’œil nu et sous une lumière inadéquate, a tendance à confondre ces reconstructions avec des irrégularités apparues au cours du tissage. De fait, la structure artisanale du lin originel du Linceul, son calibre assez fort ainsi que son tissage serré en chevron sont de nature à parfaitement intégrer ce type d’intervention. Quant à l’échantillon de Zurich (et partant « l’échantillon 1 d’Arizona ») tiré de la partie claire de la bande C14 officielle du Linceul, celui ci bien que ne présentant apparemment pas ou très peu de trace de contamination par une quelconque teinture14, n’en devait pas moins être recouvert d’une patine de microorganismes. De par l’aspect anormale de la zone où il fut prélevé, il suggère fortement, en tout cas, un second type d’intervention indétectable à l’œil nu car effectuée, elle aussi semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement : « un raccommodage à perte ». Cette technique consiste très précisément à insérer, entre les fils de trame et de chaîne, des fils (ici de coton) qui, à chaque fois, sont coupés à leurs deux extrémités sans faire de nœuds, les laissant ainsi littéralement se perdre dans le tissu de lin existant. Ces deux types spécifiques d’intervention (l’une dans le sens d’un remplacement de matière carbonée, l’autre dans celui à la fois d’un remplacement et d’un léger apport) permettraient de rendre compte de la grande dispersion des résultats observée (1238 1407) sur une si petite distance (à peine quatre centimètres de tissu). L’enduit de gomme arabique étant soluble dans l’eau et présent dans cette zone du coin supérieur gauche, il ne pouvait avoir été appliqué sur les fils superficiels des échantillons Raës et C14 qu’après l’incendie de la Sainte Chapelle de Chambéry de 1532. La teinture l’eût elle été avant, celle ci n’aurait pas dissimulé l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole dentelée car l’eau de l’incendie eût entraîné les produits de la pyrolyse locale au cœur des fils. Ce revêtement coloré ajouté tardivement explique l’absence de fluorescence aux UV observée dans cette aire particulière du drap. L’histoire de la conservation du Linceul après 1532 permet donc de dater, d’une manière très précise, au moins une sinon les deux interventions. Seules, en effet, les quatre sœurs clarisses, en 1534, et la princesse Clothilde de Savoie Bonaparte, en 1863, qui intervinrent de façon étendue sur la relique, auraient pu effectuer ce type de réparations invisibles de mains aussi expertes. Les sœurs clarisses s’étant vues confiée la tache bien spécifique de réparer et de consolider la pièce d’étoffe endommagée lors de l’incendie de 1532, la princesse de Savoie Bonaparte s’avère donc être, pour ces travaux délicats de restauration, la candidate la plus hautement probable (aidée ou non en cela du maître tapissier de la cour royale d’alors). Ce d’autant qu’en 1863, cela faisait déjà plus de cinq siècles qu’à chaque ostension à mains nues, la relique se retrouvait être tendue à l’horizontale. Tout ceci explique (ou expliquerait) pourquoi, lors de la découpe de l’échantillon et faute d’un éclairage adéquat (en lumière UV ou rasante), ces deux variantes locales passèrent totalement inaperçues aux yeux des experts textiles chargés de superviser le prélèvement pour la datation officielle de 1988. Toute leur attention était alors absorbée soit par l’étude technique du drap (qu’ils voyaient pour la toute première fois) soit par la présence gênante des fils de la couture épaisse qui liaient un résidu de la partie supérieure du Linceul au tissu à découper. Ainsi en oublièrent ils de procéder à un examen minutieux du cœur même du site textile à prélever. L’eurent ils examiné, ils n’auraient pu manquer, en effet, d’y repérer la petite reconstruction de forme serpentine, la teinture dissimulant l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole d’eau dentelée ainsi que le caractère plus raide et plus sombre de la zone. En principe, une restauration « invisible » ne saurait échapper au compte fil et a fortiori à la binoculaire lorsque l’œil derrière est compétent. Les photos qui montrent les Prs Francesco Testoré et Gabriel Vial († 2005) s’affairant avec divers instruments sont, cependant, on ne peu plus trompeuses en ce qu’elles laissent croire que lesdits experts étaient occupés à des vérifications préliminaires de l’intégrité de ladite zone quand, de fait, leurs vérifications ne furent pas étendues au cœur de l’échantillon mais se bornèrent à la seule lisière du drap. Ainsi croyant avoir libéré l’échantillon aux bords effilochés de tout fil étranger, laissèrent ils à l’opérateur, Giovanni Riggi di Numana († 2008), « le soin » de réduire à une bande rectangulaire un peu plus régulière le rectan gle grossier que celui ci, à l’aide de ciseaux de chirurgien, venait d’extraire sans gants protecteurs et plus ou moins malhabilement à la pièce principale. De toute évidence, ce technicien (à qui échut la responsabilité et du choix de l’emplacement et de la prise d’échantillon !) n’était pas expert textile pas plus qu’il n’était carbonologue ou bien archéologue15. Il semblait en effet ignorer à quel point, en matière de radiodatation, la haute technologie de l’Accélérateur Spectromètre de Masse (adaptée pour les mesures sur des microéchantillons) s’avère être sensible aux contaminations y compris à celle du sébum humain. Ce choix d’une zone qui avait fait l’objet, au cours des siècles, de nombreuses manipulations à mains nues lors des ostensions, était donc déjà, de ce seul point de vue, tout sauf judicieux.” Hope it can help..","date":"2013-10-07","mins":"4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/03/and-then-too-we-have-two-comments-from-daveb-of-wellington/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"And then, too, we have two comments from Daveb of Wellington"},{"id":"comment-78832","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Mr Nicoletti, do notice the Old French wordplay ‘MIREBEAV SVAIRE (NS) Jh ESV CRIST.

To trigger up such an accidental/providential image formation process, it requires: 1/pre or light MORDANTING conditions (i.e. Burial linen cloth in soaked with AQUEOUS ALKALI SOLUTION such as the Red Heifer waters and/or Jerusalem limestone/Malky dust mixed with waters + ammonia present in urea residues) 2/auto collimation (body covered with “opaques” present in the Judean desert and/or Jerusalem limestone/Malakystone dust + long inner burial linen cloth first tautly wrapped lengthwise and then COMPRESSED widthwise around body + NEXT TO SKIN TO CLOTH CONTACT followed by gradual loss of next to skin to cloth contact through burial inner sheet shrinkage and relative loosening as it gets sort of taut again front and back and gradually unstuck from deceased’s body the latter resting in extra height and being laid first on its left side and then right side while DRYING out 3/heating source such as corpse in hyperthermia and/or (myrrhic?) aloetic FUMIGATION as a purifying and DRYING out ritual. 4/ low temperature ALKALI GELATINISATION OF STARCH residuals present in ancient linen cloth is also a possible factor as PRINTING PASTE to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process.

Mordant is known to be used for intensifying stains e.g. In cell or tissue preparations – Potassium giving only a weak signal in Shroud bloodstains while hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) giving strong signal. Now it is well known gelatine is a breakdown product of collagen. The true fact is low temperature (55° 85° C) ALKAI GELATINISATION OF STARCH residuals present in the ancient linen cloth could be a possible factor as bubbling very fine PRINTING PASTE to be taken into account in the Shroud image formation process. – Bilirubin is neither the problem nor the solution, just probably one part of the whole equation as it could have been trapped (along with carbon monoxide?) during the image formation process. – Most likely dust, dirt and body fluids should be found in the very impurity layer that makes up the body image.” On January 30, 2013 at 8:24 a.m. (#5 Reply), I also wrote: “Most likely the bloodstains are aged “re dried re moistened freshly dried bloodstains” strongly suggesting the burial sheet was first moistened or in soaked with AQUEOUS ALKALI SOLUTION (e.g. Ashes, Jerusalem limestone dust and/or urea residues mixed with pure living water/collected rainwater).

La technique dont il s’agit ici s’avère plus précisément celle d’un « retissage par épissures », sans coutures ni nœuds, effectuée, semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement. Elle demande beaucoup de patience et une grande dextérité des doigts. Elle consiste à mettre, tout d’abord, en place les fondations de base et la chaîne. Pour ce faire, soit le tisserand commence par identifier la matière des fibres constituant les fils de chaîne puis se les procure soit il utilise systématiquement des fibres de coton. Ensuite ces fibres sont filées afin d’obtenir l’épaisseur des fils originels puis entortillées avec précaution sur elles mêmes et sur place aux fibres des fils de chaîne extraites de la partie cachée du tissu à réparer. Des fils de remplacement de la trame sont alors placés par dessus et par dessous les fils de chaîne reconstitués puis les fibres sont entortillées sur elles mêmes, là encore avec précaution, aux fibres des fils de trame originels de façon à reproduire très exactement la texture ou le motif du tissu et refermer ainsi, sans faire de nœuds, le trou ou la zone sévèrement cisaillée. Pour finir de rendre cette restauration fil à fil tout à fait invisible et consolider les épissures, une teinture à base de gomme résineuse est appliquée localement sur la trame ainsi reconstruite pour que celle ci, d’où provient l’effet de texture ou de motif, se fonde dans l’original (en l’occurrence la toile jaunie par la patine ivoire des siècles). Cette intervention sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe, si elle est bien réalisée et bien dissimulée, peut réellement être invisible sur les deux faces d’une pièce d’étoffe au point d’échapper parfois même à la main et à l’œil exercés d’une personne du métier qui, à l’œil nu et sous une lumière inadéquate, a tendance à confondre ces reconstructions avec des irrégularités apparues au cours du tissage. De fait, la structure artisanale du lin originel du Linceul, son calibre assez fort ainsi que son tissage serré en chevron sont de nature à parfaitement intégrer ce type d’intervention. Quant à l’échantillon de Zurich (et partant « l’échantillon 1 d’Arizona ») tiré de la partie claire de la bande C14 officielle du Linceul, celui ci bien que ne présentant apparemment pas ou très peu de trace de contamination par une quelconque teinture14, n’en devait pas moins être recouvert d’une patine de microorganismes. De par l’aspect anormale de la zone où il fut prélevé, il suggère fortement, en tout cas, un second type d’intervention indétectable à l’œil nu car effectuée, elle aussi semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement : « un raccommodage à perte ». Cette technique consiste très précisément à insérer, entre les fils de trame et de chaîne, des fils (ici de coton) qui, à chaque fois, sont coupés à leurs deux extrémités sans faire de nœuds, les laissant ainsi littéralement se perdre dans le tissu de lin existant. Ces deux types spécifiques d’intervention (l’une dans le sens d’un remplacement de matière carbonée, l’autre dans celui à la fois d’un remplacement et d’un léger apport) permettraient de rendre compte de la grande dispersion des résultats observée (1238 1407) sur une si petite distance (à peine quatre centimètres de tissu). L’enduit de gomme arabique étant soluble dans l’eau et présent dans cette zone du coin supérieur gauche, il ne pouvait avoir été appliqué sur les fils superficiels des échantillons Raës et C14 qu’après l’incendie de la Sainte Chapelle de Chambéry de 1532. La teinture l’eût elle été avant, celle ci n’aurait pas dissimulé l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole dentelée car l’eau de l’incendie eût entraîné les produits de la pyrolyse locale au cœur des fils. Ce revêtement coloré ajouté tardivement explique l’absence de fluorescence aux UV observée dans cette aire particulière du drap. L’histoire de la conservation du Linceul après 1532 permet donc de dater, d’une manière très précise, au moins une sinon les deux interventions. Seules, en effet, les quatre sœurs clarisses, en 1534, et la princesse Clothilde de Savoie Bonaparte, en 1863, qui intervinrent de façon étendue sur la relique, auraient pu effectuer ce type de réparations invisibles de mains aussi expertes. Les sœurs clarisses s’étant vues confiée la tache bien spécifique de réparer et de consolider la pièce d’étoffe endommagée lors de l’incendie de 1532, la princesse de Savoie Bonaparte s’avère donc être, pour ces travaux délicats de restauration, la candidate la plus hautement probable (aidée ou non en cela du maître tapissier de la cour royale d’alors). Ce d’autant qu’en 1863, cela faisait déjà plus de cinq siècles qu’à chaque ostension à mains nues, la relique se retrouvait être tendue à l’horizontale. Tout ceci explique (ou expliquerait) pourquoi, lors de la découpe de l’échantillon et faute d’un éclairage adéquat (en lumière UV ou rasante), ces deux variantes locales passèrent totalement inaperçues aux yeux des experts textiles chargés de superviser le prélèvement pour la datation officielle de 1988. Toute leur attention était alors absorbée soit par l’étude technique du drap (qu’ils voyaient pour la toute première fois) soit par la présence gênante des fils de la couture épaisse qui liaient un résidu de la partie supérieure du Linceul au tissu à découper. Ainsi en oublièrent ils de procéder à un examen minutieux du cœur même du site textile à prélever. L’eurent ils examiné, ils n’auraient pu manquer, en effet, d’y repérer la petite reconstruction de forme serpentine, la teinture dissimulant l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole d’eau dentelée ainsi que le caractère plus raide et plus sombre de la zone. En principe, une restauration « invisible » ne saurait échapper au compte fil et a fortiori à la binoculaire lorsque l’œil derrière est compétent. Les photos qui montrent les Prs Francesco Testoré et Gabriel Vial († 2005) s’affairant avec divers instruments sont, cependant, on ne peu plus trompeuses en ce qu’elles laissent croire que lesdits experts étaient occupés à des vérifications préliminaires de l’intégrité de ladite zone quand, de fait, leurs vérifications ne furent pas étendues au cœur de l’échantillon mais se bornèrent à la seule lisière du drap. Ainsi croyant avoir libéré l’échantillon aux bords effilochés de tout fil étranger, laissèrent ils à l’opérateur, Giovanni Riggi di Numana († 2008), « le soin » de réduire à une bande rectangulaire un peu plus régulière le rectan gle grossier que celui ci, à l’aide de ciseaux de chirurgien, venait d’extraire sans gants protecteurs et plus ou moins malhabilement à la pièce principale. De toute évidence, ce technicien (à qui échut la responsabilité et du choix de l’emplacement et de la prise d’échantillon !) n’était pas expert textile pas plus qu’il n’était carbonologue ou bien archéologue15. Il semblait en effet ignorer à quel point, en matière de radiodatation, la haute technologie de l’Accélérateur Spectromètre de Masse (adaptée pour les mesures sur des microéchantillons) s’avère être sensible aux contaminations y compris à celle du sébum humain. Ce choix d’une zone qui avait fait l’objet, au cours des siècles, de nombreuses manipulations à mains nues lors des ostensions, était donc déjà, de ce seul point de vue, tout sauf judicieux.” Hope it can help..","date":"2013-06-22","mins":"5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/20/colin-berry-a-hunch-just-that-that-rogers-may-have-been-used/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry:  a hunch – just that – that Rogers may have been used"},{"id":"comment-37940","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Re my RESEARCH paper on the TS 1988 radiocarbon dating: Bibliographie (par ordre chronologique) • The Frenway System of French Reweaving, Fabricon Compagny Chicago, Illinois, 1951. • Radiological Examination of the Shroud of Turin – A Preliminary Report, Mottern, Landon et Morris, 1979. • Rapporto Sindone, Giovanni Riggi di Numana, éd. 3 M, Milan 1988. • Rogue Fibres found in the Shroud, P.H.

Therefore I will ONLY tell you about me WHAT IS REALLY RELEVANT to know in this debate and no more namely I am a professional cryptologist (since 2005) who created 5 new approaches in cryptology among which one applied to criminology and another to both Late Antique and Medieval archaeology in relation with enigmatic image, inscription and text perception. I first applied my archaeocryptological/archaeopereptive approach (in 2006) to the enigmatic graffiti in the Coudray Tower, Chinon, France (see my 2006 Loches paper entitled “D’une pierre a graffiti templiers dans la tour du Coudray à Chinon”, proceedings 4ème Colloque national sur les Graffiti Anciens de Loches, 2010, éd. ASPAG/Indre Regional Council). I was an amateur cryptologist for 20 years and have been a professional cryptologist for more than 7 years to present (i.e. I have a 27 years’ experience as a cryptologist). I am also a Shroud scholar and researcher (I first got interested in the Turin Shroud as early as 1988). I attended 4 international Turin Shroud conferences, in Nice (France, 1997), Turin (Italy, 1998), Frascati (Italy, 2010) and Torun (Poland, 2011) and made an indirect contribution in the first one and a direct contribution in the last 3 of them).” Reminder for CB: Don’t you put words in my mouth, I NEVER described myself as “Dr”, only as “Professor” (the fact is the title “Dr” in stead of “Pr” may have appeared in an international conference program but this is not my responsibility). In France the Academic ranks differ from the English speaking countries. Prior to 1984, in France you did’t need to have a Ph D to be a University professor but had to pass ‘un concours’ and be hired by the French ministry of Foreign Affairs to teach abroad as such. BTW, in France, meta analysis is acknowledged as research work in se. It does seem MR Colin Berry (who lived 5 years in France and cannot even read AND understand French) is also ignorant of the fact. RE MR Colin Berry most spurious interpretation of the Lirey badge within his Scorch theory + his denial/utter ignorance of the real Khi2 value as far as the TS 1988 radiocarbon dating is concerned, can Colin Berry NOW tell us what is his expertise in Templar archaeology AND meta analysis?

In my 2007 research paper on the TS C14 dating fiasco, I wrote: “Parmi ces quelques fils ou sections de fils provenant de cette zone plus sombre que forment le Coin de Raës et plus des deux tiers de l’échantillon C14 officiel, Rogers identifia, consolidé par l’enduit résineux, un fil ayant subi une épissure bout à bout de deux fils d’origines différentes. Des fibres de ce fil s’échappaient, en effet, de sa partie centrale et d’autres fibres situées à ses deux extrémités se trouvaient positionnées en sens inverse. Anomalie qui avait déjà été remarquée en 1988 sur le seul et unique fil qu’examina au microscope le Pr Edward Hall du Laboratoire d’Oxford (Cette anomalie, pourtant elle aussi avérée, n’a pas non plus été évoquée lors de la toute dernière communication de Madame Metchild Flury Lemberg. On ne peut que le regretter). I also wrote about the 1982 unofficial attempt at radiocarbon dating the TS: “Comme beaucoup de gens encore aujourd’hui, ils (Tite et al) ignoraient qu’en 1982, un minéralogiste de renommée mondiale, le Pr George R. Rossman du laboratoire de l’Institut Technologique de la Californie (« Caltech ») à Pasa dena, avait déjà procédé d’une façon non officielle, à un test radiocarbone sur la relique. Le micro échantillon daté en secret6 avait consisté en un seul et unique fil d’environ 8 cm tiré à partir de la zone de l’échantillon semi triangulaire7 prélevé, en 1973, par le Pr Gilbert Raës ; zone jouxtant celle précisément où avait été extrait l’échantillon C14 officiel. Le fil dont une partie était apparue enduite d’une couche superficielle plus sombre avait été coupé en deux. On avait alors abouti, pour le même fil, à une datation à deux extrémités encore plus hétérogènes que celle obtenue en 1988 par les trois autres laboratoires : le I Ie siècle pour la partie apparemment non contaminée et le XI Ie siècle pour l’autre partie pourtant décontaminée (soit un différentiel de mille années !). Rossman ne publia jamais son résultat. En 1988 tout comme en 1982, le principe même de la datation par la méthode éprouvée du radiocar bone ne pouvait être mis en cause. Pas plus qu’on ne pouvait douter du sérieux avec lequel furent, à chaque fois, effectuées les mesures de la teneur en radiocarbone surtout lorsqu’on sait qu’en 1988 les diverses phases de la procédure classique de mesure furent doublées voire même triplées pour certains des microéchantillons lors de mesures d’essai. Que des microéchantillons provenant de la même aire du drap puissent refléter cinq points diffé rents dans le temps (le X Ve, XI Ve, XII Ie, XI Ie et I Ie siècle de notre ère), permet de conclure, de toute évidence, non pas à des erreurs aléatoires (hasard statistique ou approximations commises au cours de l’analyse) mais à une erreur systématique due à l’hétérogénéité des échantillons testés. En d’autres termes, cela signifie que toute cette série de datations 14 C erratiques du même objet ne pouvaient être dû qu’à un prélèvement d’échantillons de provenance douteuse et à la non élimination de carbones plus récents malgré les traitements physiques et chimiques de nettoyage employés par lesdits laboratoires. En fonction de la valeur réelle du test du khi2 (valeur faussée dans le rapport officiel, 5 pour 1,04), il existe très exactement pas moins de 98,96 chances sur 100 pour que les différences des dates moyennes entre les 3 laboratoires soient dues au manque d’homogénéité du matériel daté en 1988. Selon le physicien en radiocarbone français Jacques Évin, pour concilier la date historiquement possible du Ier siècle avec la fameuse datation en âge moyen de 1260 1390, (soit avec la mesure radiocarbone 663 ± 65 années avant la date de référence de 1988), « l’échantillon atypique idéal » devrait avoir été formé, d’un poids de carbone moderne égal au poids de carbone du lin originel ou bien, dit autrement, être composé à 50% de fibres de 1858 1988 et à 50% de fibres du Ier siècle de notre ère parfaitement mêlés. D’après une autre estimation par le physicien américain John Jackson, il était possible que cette proportion fut de deux tiers/un tiers8 (66% 33%).” 2/Statistical sleigh of hand (Reminder) As a foot note: “Annoncé officiellement à 5 % (soit juste le seuil de validité admis), le niveau de signification (ou degré de cohérence) des résultats interlaboratoires, une fois recalculé, s’avéra être totalement faux. Il était, en fait, de 1,04 % c’est à dire bien en dessous du seuil critique impliquant, soit qu’une erreur systématique avait été commise au cours de l’analyse (ce qui n’était pas le cas) soit que l’échantillon n’était pas homogène (ce qui était précisément le cas). Ainsi, “par obligation de résultat”, Mme Sheridan Bowman, la responsable de la partie statistique de l’expérience, avait elle « arrondi » ce chiffre de 1,04% » à 5%. On ne peut que regretter cet excès de zèle par complaisance envers son patron, le Dr Michael Tite. Celui ci n’avait, en effet, jamais fait mystère qu’il ne croyait pas à l’authenticité du Linceul de Turin.” It just seem the recurrent presence of spliced threads (coton with linen) found in the TS Raes C14 corner and Tite and Bowman’s gross statistical sleigh of hand are just anecdotal pieces of evidence in Hugh’s and CB’s eyes….","date":"2013-06-22","mins":"8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/20/colin-berry-a-hunch-just-that-that-rogers-may-have-been-used/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry:  a hunch – just that – that Rogers may have been used"},{"id":"comment-37742","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"For all his posturing, Mr Colin Berry clearly does not have the first clue about carbon dating technology.

Several passages of my 2007 paper were published as comments on this very blog. You probably missed them. I wrote the text as I first thought of joining the SSG. Here are two email excerpts from Marcel Alonso: 1/Marcel ALONSO 20/06/2009 à Giulio (Fanti), moi Cher Ami, J’ai enfin lu attentivement vos textes et je tiens à vous féliciter pour votre travail de synthèse et de présentation, ainsi que votre discernement qui vous permet de mettre en valeur ce qu’il y a de positif dans le fatras des observations publiées.(…) 2/Marcel ALONSO 02/07/2009 à moi Veuillez excuser ce retard, j’étais en voyage à Nîmes… J’ai bien reçu votre nouveau texte, toujours intéressant, mais dont les corrections/discussions risquent d’être longues… Or, dans l’immédiat, à la suite de différends avec les principaux leaders du SSG, j’ai été amené finalement à décider de n’y plus participer, et donc je me vois mal y retourner immédiatement en proposant votre admission… Aujourd’hui, le participant français très actif, et tout à fait qualifié, est le Dr Thibault Heimberger. Je vous propose donc de lui envoyer notre correspondance afin qu’il puisse en prendre la suite et présenter votre candidature, laquelle ne devrait pas poser de problèmes puisque vous semblez pouvoir vous exprimer aisément en Anglais et qu’il me paraît acquis que la version anglaise de votre synthèse intéressera dans l’ensemble les membres présents du SSG. (…) I finally dropped the idea of joining the SSG (after the 2010 Frascati International Workshop) as I became aware SSG members were most if not all arch miraculists and I would to have to disagree with most if not all of them… all the time. Here is the Résumé: En 1988 et en contradiction avec les conclusions de près de cent ans de recherches multidisciplinaires, le Linceul de Turin fut déclaré d’origine médiévale par le Dr Michaël Tite, coordinateur des trois laboratoires universi taires de datation radiocarbone d’Oxford, de Zurich et de Tucson (Arizona) chargés conjointement de dater un échantillon de tissu prélevé sur la relique. À en croire le Pr Évin, porte parole officiel de l’expérience, ce résultat, était incontestable. Pourtant, vingt années de contre expertises plus tard, un noyau irréductible de faits avérés contribuent à accréditer très fortement la thèse selon laquelle, lors d’une petite restauration invisible (voire même de deux) effectuée au XI Xe siècle, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement, du matériel textile étranger de remplacement beaucoup plus récent avait été habilement entremêlé aux fils de lin originels dans le coin supérieur gauche du Linceul d’où avait été extrait l’échantillon. Cette matière carbonée, issue d’activités humaines postérieures à la formation du lin, ne fut ni détectée ni éliminée que ce soit par les deux experts textiles responsables du prélèvement ou bien par les trois laboratoires qui procédèrent à la mesure de la teneur carbone 14 résiduelle de l’échantillon officiel.

Now WB wrote: “The Man of the Shroud, however, was given an honorable burial, in a truly exceptional manner, wrapped in a precious cloth with aromatics. Moreover, the lack of distortion of the body image (except for a few small areas) supposes that the cloth lay flat under and over the body, doubled over at the head—a manner unknown in all the world. This can be understood only in the light of a hasty and provisional burial, as suggested in the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ burial.” Re Historical circumstances in the death and burial of Yeshua in light of the Shroud image, HAD Werner Bulst really relied on the Gospels as he claimed, he should have known at least: 1/ Re a speedy burial (Luke 23:54: “It was Preparation day and the Sabbath was beginning to grow light” = the stars which marks a new day, here the beginning of the Sabbath, were shining), which by the way is part and parcel of Judean/Jewish burial), “(…) Heb. Layla, “night”; typically layla is taken to be when you can see three stars in the sky in reference to tset ha kokhavim, the first “three stars coming out” to announce a new day (here the great Shabbat of Pessa H). The 3rd star respectively appeared at 19:38 p.m. On April 7th 30 CE and 19:08 p.m. On April 3rd 33 CE. (…) Hence, the actual maximum time frame for Rabbi Yeshua’s burial was 4h04. If we now take off 30 45mn to Pilate’s and back + 30 45mn to take down Yeshua’s body from the cross and carry it to the garden tomb near by, we are left with a minimum time frame of about 2h30. It totally rules out the pseudo “0h30 burial scenario” as the very notions of ‘evening’, ‘sunset’ ‘twilight dusk’ and ‘night’ as time markers, do not philologically cover the same realities for a Judean as they do for a 20th 21st reader relatively or totally unfamiliar with the Judean ethnic milieu of the Second Temple period. Within a minimum of 2h30, Rabbi Yeshua’s 4 5 buriers had enough time to pre wash his body (i.e. To re dampen most of his wounds – to the sole exception of those likely to flow so as to keep his blood with his body as much as possible), purify his shed innocent blood via his lengthy inner shroud (Gr. Sindôn/Heb. Sadin) soaked with alkaline waters and tightly wrap it up, with insect repellent fresh plants and floral heads (Gr. Aromaton, “spices”), in linen clothes and strips (most likely the fresh spices were laterally placed on the long inner shroud aka the TS and then compressed along with objects through wrapping against Rabbi Yeshua’s naked body and acted as a screen.)” (This I wrote on August 19, 2012 at 12:16 pm in this very blog). 2/ Neither Yeshua’s dead body could have been just “(loosely) draped over” as WB also implied. The (phrase)/conjugated verb is never used in conjunction with Yeshua’s burial through all the 4 Gospel accounts in koine/translation Greek. The Greek verbs entulisso, “to wrap, wind, encircle”; eneileo, “to compress, tightly wrap up” and deo, “to bind, fasten” are used instead and no others to describe the dressing in shrouds. Most curiously though, that’s a literary and philological fact Werner Bults just kept overlooking (and so does his blind folded follower aka Yannick Clément). From the three koine Greek verbs really used in the Gospels to describe the way Yeshua’s body was wrapped in linen/shrouds with “spices” (along with objects) and in the hypothesis the Turin Shroud bloodied body image is that of Yeshua as crucifixion victim, literally and philologically speaking we can rightly deduce the wrapping was done tightly around the whole body from head to toe..","date":"2014-05-28","mins":"9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/25/dissent-of-the-day-ill-say-one-thing-for-jones/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dissent of the day:  I’ll say one thing for Jones"},{"id":"comment-125700","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Reminder for Yannick Clément: “You’re neither right nor wrong because other people agree with you.

Dave, you wrote: « the fact remains that at the time of image formation, the cloth was so disposed as to produce an orthogonal image. I cannot accept Max’s explanation that this came about because of any stretching or shrinkage of the cloth. It makes no geometrical sense to me at all. » Had you really made a couple of attempts to experimentally reconstruct the TSM’s burial as I did in the 1990s (especially his dressing in shrouds and fumigation in extra height with his stiff rigid body resting in extra height on its right side) and considered the phenomena of ‘truncated horizontal panoramicity’ (head, torso, lower & upper limps), volumetric (com)pressure with bloodied body frontal & dorsal imprints recorded as image in plane with intriguing distortions, twill weave linen specific mechanical responses (whether dry or in soaked with alkali solution, whether shrinking taut or non taut lengthwise while compressed widthwise by an all enveloping sovev), my explanation could have made ‘geometrical sense’ as far as “complex variable projective geometry” is concerned. Re the alleged “absence of distortions” in conjunction with the cloth as flat surface: the true fact is the Sindon image is affected by several distortions: two squared ‘U’ shaped boxes framing up the Shroud face; absence of a neck image along with presence of chin lower area (vertical panoramicity); unusually long adducted abducted arms (of which rigor statuaries, “statuar rigidity”, was counter acted) and seemingly long fingers on the right hand (implying both dislocation and uneven stretching at the arm level). Along with head slightly bent forward, curved back and legs bent with raised knees, all these distortions do point in one direction: a volumetric recording of a moulded stiff rigid bloodied body with at least two slightly different body to cloth configurations (initial and final). The distortions in conjunction with rigor mortis signs or not are a matter of “complex variable projective geometry” as the long inner burial cloth though transversely compressed, shrank up and got somehow taut again lengthwise – during the Sindon image formation process with slight gradual pressure release (e.g. At counter acted rigor statuaris arm level resulting in a slight lengthening of the right arm image and fingers on the right hand image). BTW Dave, if there was no FIRST body to cloth contact and THEN gradual slight loss of contact (as the watery solution in soaked inner shroud aka the TS dried out (through fumigation) and got somehow taut again lengthwise (through shrinking), geometrically speaking what is your explanation to account for the following distortions: 1/ blood rivulets FIRST appearing on the face and THEN as if on the hair 2/ some bloodstains appearing in the area of the back of the knees BUT no image while the very fact the small of the back is recorded (despite lordosis)?

The true fact is your worn out interpretation flatly contradicts the Gospels and only works on a self serving take and leave basis JUST to fit an arch miraculistic preconception of the TS image. Philologically and hermeneutically speaking, your preconception have you most curiously TOTALLY overlook the koine/translation Greek verbs used in the Gospels to describe Yeshua’s dressing in shrouds ON FRIDAY. When will you ever consider the likeliness of the TS man’s body having been ALREADY “wound/compressed/fastened” in linen clothes/shrouds with ‘aromaton’ ON FRIDAY for such is ALSO the meaning of the koine/translation Greek verbs entulisso, “to wind”, eneileo, “to compress”, and deo, “to fasten” used in the conjugated form in the Gospels? When will you ever consider the UNLIKELINESS for the said three koine Greek verbs to ever mean “to loosely drape over”? Philologically speaking, your worn out interpretation is totally inconsistent with the 3 koiné Greek words used in the Gospels to describe Yeshu’s body as wound/compressed/fastened in shrouds along with ‘aromaton’. Shall I repeat the manner of Second Temple period Judeans to bury” their dead was NOT just to ‘loosely drape over’ their body with a linen cloth but to WIND/COMPRESS/FASTEN them in linen clothes/shrouds with ‘aromaton’. I do stand correct here as far as Philology and the Gospels are concerned and you stand incorrect. Have you ever thought the linen shrouds could also be used to counter act rigor mortis if need be (especially the abducted arms in rigor statuaris) so as to have the deceased’s body rests as flat as possible and be composed in dignity? Now you ALSO want us to think the women wanted NOT ONLY to anoint Yeshuas’ dead body but also to undress and redress him in shrouds! This is NOT what the Gospels say at all! Anointing Yeshua’s body 2 3 days after he had been buried shall be understood in light of visits paid to the deceased and as a procedure to preventing bad smells on those subsequent visits. Most likely the women were NOT to anoint his naked but ONLY his already tightly wrapped up body, which makes a world of a difference. You also wrote “Jesus was executed as a criminal”. Was he really buried as such by secret disciples who thought he was innocent? Was not his body honored? When will you ever consider the likeliness of the shroud had been in soaked with a watery/alkali solution for the sake of purifying the SHED INNOCENT BLOOD within a Judean funerary context? Reminder: the Giv’at ha Mivtar ossuary that held the bones of the sole crucifixion victim ever found in the Land of Israel, implies though an alleged ‘criminal’, the latter was even HONORED WITH A SECONDARY BURIAL. You also wrote: “The gospels say that a burial cloth was bought”. On March 21, 2013 at 7:00 am, I wrote: Re Mark 15:46. Actually it should be read: “And he (Joseph of Arimathea) HAD BOUGHT (literally “HAVING bought” in koine Greek as it is in the aorist) a linen cloth (for his own burial), and he took him down, and wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out in the rock and he rolled a stone”. The aorist here renders the Hellenised Aramaic/Hebrew wayyiqtol used as ‘pluperfect’) so the  undefined tense of this verb looks like an aorist.” Do you really think Yeshua’s secret disciples and buriers just buried him ‘not even half dressed in shrouds’ within the tomb when from his death on the cross to the closing of the tomb, the maximum time frame for his burial was 4h04 and the minimum 2h 2h30? When will you ever consider speedy/hasty burials were/are part and parcel of Judean/Jewish burial time honored customs? They were the rule not the exception as you misleadingly imply.The TS man’s dressing in shrouds needed 4 5/5 6 buriers on hasty burial (i.e. Within 2 hours – 2 hours and a half) with only four (burial on the same day of death before night; dressing in shrouds; purifying and drying out of five (anointing being postponed after Sabbath) of the core burial procedures performed.

Othonia) used to wind/wrap/compress/tightly wrap up/bind /fasten his body with ‘aromaton’ as is the manner of the Judeans to bury. The Aramaic ‘sudara’ (Gr.

This was the minimum that had to be done, there was no time for the rest of the conventions, which were left for Sunday morning.” And then: “According to the late Father Raymond E. Brown, who was a world renowned Biblical scholar, Joseph did not have time to give Jesus a proper burial, which would include washing the body, anointing it with oil and then clothing and wrapping it.” Is that the way you understand Raymond E. Brown’s exegesis when the latter wrote: “(so) It gives the impression (Joseph did not have time)” irrespective of the fact “John has a more elaborate Judean (funerary) custom”. – Factually speaking, what then really makes YOU be so much assertive (“there was no time for the rest of the conventions”) as if it was a proven fact and there were no alternative conclusions ? Could you give me your exact time frame for Yeshua’s “burial”, explain and demonstrate it, please? Could you also be more specific on which conventions exactly were done or not done? Reminder one: Irrespective of entombment on the same day of death (Dt 21:23), and sealing the tomb, the true fact is a full burial (whether speedy or not) included three major stages to preparing the body for burial: washing (rechitzah, done indirectly with warm water, with or without anointing done with spicy oily perfumes), ritual purification (taharah), and wrapping/dressing (halbashah) in shrouds (with fresh flower heads placed (?) and/or granulized spices spread as the cloth is tightly wound/compressed around the body). The term taharah is used to refer both to the overall process of burial preparation, and to the specific step of ritual purification. . Actually, it looks more like a “some rite” burial, because of the quantity of myrrh and aloes and statue of the two known members of the burial party Joseph and Nicodemus. This in light of the Turin Shroud (white zigzag weave patterned shroud used for a Master of Torah or righteous man worthy to be placed in paradise) indicates that Yeshua was honourably buried in accordance with the already documented Judeans requirements. He was speedily yet fully buried even if anointing could not be performed on the very day of his death as women were not allowed to grind granulized spices on Sabbath and mixed them with oil to form an ointment to rub on the body. From the textual data, there is no reason to assume that the they regarded the burial of Yeshua as ‘uncompleted’ at all. Reminder two: re whether the body was washed or not, the issue shall not be tackled from a modern viewpoint as the correct answer just depends on one’s capacity to archaeologically reconstruct the event (most likely a Judean burial) according to a specific purifying and drying ritual implying here shed innocent blood being kept/buried with the body. Besides there was indeed some purifying/indirect washing with water of the body otherwise the TS shroud should be smudged or smeared. Cannot you discriminate between a linen cloth smudged or smeared with the blood and fluids of an unwashed bloodied body (e.g. The Oviedo Sudarium) and one which most obviously is not?

The “non interpreted” nature of the physical details in the narratives seems trustworthy enough to consider the description of the burial as being true to fact. “They took the body of Yeshua and fastened/bound it with the ‘aromaton’ in linen cloths/shrouds, according to the burial custom of the Judeans” [John 19.40].

There is an alternative. On August 19, 2012 at 12:16 pm, I wrote: “In the Judean ethnic milieu of the time, the tradition was to visit the deceased on the three (or even seven) days immediately following his burial. Purification (with or without anointment) was part and parcel of the Judean burial rite. Anointment allowed preventing stench on those subsequent visits. Since it could not have been done on Friday, the women bought and prepared spicy oils to anoint Rabbi Yeshua after the Sabbath and come back to the tomb very early on the first day of the Judean week. They definitely had not to unwrap, wash the deceased’s naked body, anoint it and dress it in shrouds at all but just to anoint the linen wrappings as Yeshua’s body was ALREADY wound/compressed/fastened with ‘aromaton’ in (See the Gospels). Hence, to the sole exception of the anointment ritual, Rabbi Yeshua’s “primary” burial rite according to the Judean funerary custom of the Second Temple period could have been duly completed within a minimum of a two hours and a half time frame.” “Obviously I have no time frame, but neither have you. The gospels tell us that the disciples were in a hurry, that’s all”. I do have a time frame based on Hebrew markers, archaeoastronomy, Second Temple period Judean ethnic milieu (Talmudic literature) and the 4 Gospels (I even presented a paper on Yeshua’s burial time frame in 1998). YOU have no time frame at all. Reminder: speedy/hasty burials on the very day of death are part and parcel of Judean/Jewish funerary customs.

La technique dont il s’agit ici s’avère plus précisément celle d’un « retissage par épissures », sans coutures ni nœuds, effectuée, semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement. Elle demande beaucoup de patience et une grande dextérité des doigts. Elle consiste à mettre, tout d’abord, en place les fondations de base et la chaîne. Pour ce faire, soit le tisserand commence par identifier la matière des fibres constituant les fils de chaîne puis se les procure soit il utilise systématiquement des fibres de coton. Ensuite ces fibres sont filées afin d’obtenir l’épaisseur des fils originels puis entortillées avec précaution sur elles mêmes et sur place aux fibres des fils de chaîne extraites de la partie cachée du tissu à réparer. Des fils de remplacement de la trame sont alors placés par dessus et par dessous les fils de chaîne reconstitués puis les fibres sont entortillées sur elles mêmes, là encore avec précaution, aux fibres des fils de trame originels de façon à reproduire très exactement la texture ou le motif du tissu et refermer ainsi, sans faire de nœuds, le trou ou la zone sévèrement cisaillée. Pour finir de rendre cette restauration fil à fil tout à fait invisible et consolider les épissures, une teinture à base de gomme résineuse est appliquée localement sur la trame ainsi reconstruite pour que celle ci, d’où provient l’effet de texture ou de motif, se fonde dans l’original (en l’occurrence la toile jaunie par la patine ivoire des siècles). Cette intervention sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe, si elle est bien réalisée et bien dissimulée, peut réellement être invisible sur les deux faces d’une pièce d’étoffe au point d’échapper parfois même à la main et à l’œil exercés d’une personne du métier qui, à l’œil nu et sous une lumière inadéquate, a tendance à confondre ces reconstructions avec des irrégularités apparues au cours du tissage. De fait, la structure artisanale du lin originel du Linceul, son calibre assez fort ainsi que son tissage serré en chevron sont de nature à parfaitement intégrer ce type d’intervention. Quant à l’échantillon de Zurich (et partant « l’échantillon 1 d’Arizona ») tiré de la partie claire de la bande C14 officielle du Linceul, celui ci bien que ne présentant apparemment pas ou très peu de trace de contamination par une quelconque teinture14, n’en devait pas moins être recouvert d’une patine de microorganismes. De par l’aspect anormale de la zone où il fut prélevé, il suggère fortement, en tout cas, un second type d’intervention indétectable à l’œil nu car effectuée, elle aussi semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement : « un raccommodage à perte ». Cette technique consiste très précisément à insérer, entre les fils de trame et de chaîne, des fils (ici de coton) qui, à chaque fois, sont coupés à leurs deux extrémités sans faire de nœuds, les laissant ainsi littéralement se perdre dans le tissu de lin existant. Ces deux types spécifiques d’intervention (l’une dans le sens d’un remplacement de matière carbonée, l’autre dans celui à la fois d’un remplacement et d’un léger apport) permettraient de rendre compte de la grande dispersion des résultats observée (1238 1407) sur une si petite distance (à peine quatre centimètres de tissu). L’enduit de gomme arabique étant soluble dans l’eau et présent dans cette zone du coin supérieur gauche, il ne pouvait avoir été appliqué sur les fils superficiels des échantillons Raës et C14 qu’après l’incendie de la Sainte Chapelle de Chambéry de 1532. La teinture l’eût elle été avant, celle ci n’aurait pas dissimulé l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole dentelée car l’eau de l’incendie eût entraîné les produits de la pyrolyse locale au cœur des fils. Ce revêtement coloré ajouté tardivement explique l’absence de fluorescence aux UV observée dans cette aire particulière du drap. L’histoire de la conservation du Linceul après 1532 permet donc de dater, d’une manière très précise, au moins une sinon les deux interventions. Seules, en effet, les quatre sœurs clarisses, en 1534, et la princesse Clothilde de Savoie Bonaparte, en 1863/8, qui intervinrent de façon étendue sur la relique, auraient pu effectuer ce type de réparations invisibles de mains aussi expertes. Les sœurs clarisses s’étant vues confiée la tache bien spécifique de réparer et de consolider la pièce d’étoffe endommagée lors de l’incendie de 1532, la princesse de Savoie Bonaparte s’avère donc être, pour ces travaux délicats de restauration, la candidate la plus hautement probable (aidée ou non en cela du maître tapissier de la cour royale d’alors). Ce d’autant qu’en 1863, cela faisait déjà plus de cinq siècles qu’à chaque ostension à mains nues, la relique se retrouvait être tendue à l’horizontale. Tout ceci explique (ou expliquerait) pourquoi, lors de la découpe de l’échantillon et faute d’un éclairage adéquat (en lumière UV ou rasante), ces deux variantes locales passèrent totalement inaperçues aux yeux des experts textiles chargés de superviser le prélèvement pour la datation officielle de 1988. Toute leur attention était alors absorbée soit par l’étude technique du drap (qu’ils voyaient pour la toute première fois) soit par la présence gênante des fils de la couture épaisse qui liaient un résidu de la partie supérieure du Linceul au tissu à découper. Ainsi en oublièrent ils de procéder à un examen minutieux du cœur même du site textile à prélever. L’eurent ils examiné, ils n’auraient pu manquer, en effet, d’y repérer la petite reconstruction de forme serpentine, la teinture dissimulant l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole d’eau dentelée ainsi que le caractère plus raide et plus sombre de la zone. En principe, une restauration « invisible » ne saurait échapper au compte fil et a fortiori à la binoculaire lorsque l’œil derrière est compétent. Les photos qui montrent les Prs Francesco Testoré et Gabriel Vial († 2005) s’affairant avec divers instruments sont, cependant, on ne peu plus trompeuses en ce qu’elles laissent croire que lesdits experts étaient occupés à des vérifications préliminaires de l’intégrité de ladite zone quand, de fait, leurs vérifications ne furent pas étendues au cœur de l’échantillon mais se bornèrent à la seule lisière du drap. Ainsi croyant avoir libéré l’échantillon aux bords effilochés de tout fil étranger, laissèrent ils à l’opérateur, Giovanni Riggi di Numana († 2008), « le soin » de réduire à une bande rectangulaire un peu plus régulière le rectangle grossier que celui ci, à l’aide de ciseaux de chirurgien, venait d’extraire sans gants protecteurs et plus ou moins malhabilement à la pièce principale. De toute évidence, ce technicien (à qui échut la responsabilité et du choix de l’emplacement et de la prise d’échantillon !) n’était pas expert textile pas plus qu’il n’était carbonologue ou bien archéologue15. Il semblait en effet ignorer à quel point, en matière de radiodatation, la haute technologie de l’Accélérateur Spectromètre de Masse (adaptée pour les mesures sur des microéchantillons) s’avère être sensible aux contaminations y compris à celle du sébum humain. Ce choix d’une zone qui avait fait l’objet, au cours des siècles, de nombreuses manipulations à mains nues lors des ostensions, était donc déjà, de ce seul point de vue, tout sauf judicieux.”.","date":"2014-05-20","mins":"1:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/documented-pieces-removed-from-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Documented Pieces Removed from the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-122135","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Besides I have no that much time to do the translation work..","date":"2014-05-20","mins":"2:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/documented-pieces-removed-from-the-shroud/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Documented Pieces Removed from the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-122133","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Thank you clublu22014.

Actually when put in perspective, no matter how huge the proportion (66,66% or 50%), this 1858 1988 CE carbon replacement amounts to a very tiny quantity (0.106g or 0.079g) in terms of very circumscribed microreconstructions (in one or two very small areas) for a 1st c CE old linen to appear to be 13th 14th century CE by contamination.” In my 2007 2008 research paper entitled: LINCEUL DE TURIN : FAUSSE RELIQUE OU FAUSSE DATATION Carbone 14 ? and subtitled: (Contre enquête sur un fiasco scientifique) I wrote: “[..]toute la valeur réelle de la datation C14 de 1988, ne repose que sur trois sous échantillons ne s’avérant, en moyenne, pas plus grands qu’un timbre poste de 1,69 x 1,32 cm et pesant chacun, toujours en moyenne, 52,83 mg. Le poids unitaire du Linceul étant estimé à 0,023 g/cm2 ± 10%, au sein de l’échantillon parent C14 pesant 158,5 mg ± 0,3mg, il suffirait au pire d’un remplacement soit d’à peine 106 millièmes de gramme ± 10% de fibres textiles originelles du Ier siècle par une quantité égale de fibres beaucoup plus récentes issues de réparations invisibles effectuées entre 1858 et 1988 (estimation haute selon Jackson), soit de seulement 79 millièmes de gramme ± 10% (estimation basse selon Évin) pour que la relique présumée de « 1260 1390 » soit définitivement enlevée au Moyen Age et se retrouve placée à l’époque coloniale romaine.

Now just guess what was observed in the Raes C14 corner sample? – Swiss textile expert Metchild Flury Lemberg NEVER examined in situ textilis the very core of the C14 sample of which about 90% was used for C14 dating the TS. Besides she NEVER had direct access niether to the 1988 official C14 sample riserva nor the two pieces of the Arizona sample that were not used. – Thrice already I posted the following excerpt from my 2007 paper entitled “LINCEUL DE TURIN : FAUSSE RELIQUE OU FAUSSE DATATION Carbone 14 ?” and subtitled: “(Contre enquête sur un fiasco scientifique)”. Here is the relevant excerpt re Mme Metchild Flury Lemberg’s opinion, I commented in a note (10): ” 10. – Lorsque l’on sait que de petites reconstructions invisibles à l’œil nu et à la lumière naturelle du jour pouvaient se trouver très circonscrites au cœur même du site de l’échantillon carbone 14 daté, on est pour le moins étonné qu’une experte textile de la valeur de Mme Metchild Flury Lemberg, sans même avoir JAMAIS examiné de visu ledit cœur de l’échantillon in situ textilis ni avoir pris connaissance de la photographie précise et contrastée d’Enrié ni des radiophotographies de la relique de Miller, puisse affirmer sans ambages que la texture dudit échantillon était uniforme et intacte. Partant du principe qu’un expert textile se devait d’être très attentif à l’origine (et à la représentativité) des fils qu’il observe, de toute évidence, il semblerait qu’il demeure difficile pour Mme Metchild Flury Lemberg d’accepter un seul instant l’idée que des confrères (Prs Testore et Vial) aient pu, juste avant la découpe de l’échantillon brut, ne pas procéder, à l’aide de loupes, compte fils et binoculaires, à l’examen des fils de chaîne et de trame au cœur même du site de prélèvement. Pourtant, et à preuve du contraire, ceux ci n’examinèrent que la bord externe de l’échantillon qui venait d’être découpé par Riggi” – Re the TWO different types of microreconstructions that could mainly account for the linen to appear medieval, I wrote (my 2007 paper on the TS 1988 C14 dating fiasco): “(…) NON DETECTION D’UNE ZONE (SION DEUX) AYANT SUBI DES REPARATIONS INVISIBLES A L’OEIL NU Tout cet ensemble d’éléments directs et indirects constitue un faisceau d’indices concordants : il tend à témoigner, dans ladite zone plus raide et plus sombre, d’une intervention selon une technique bien particulière inspirée de la technique du « retissage à la française » (bien connue des maîtres tapissiers ainsi que des experts en histoire de la tapisserie) ; technique qu’il ne faut cependant pas confondre avec celle d’un simple « entissage » d’un patch médiéval, repérable, quant à lui, à l’œil nu et à la lumière naturelle du jour par un spécialiste. La technique dont il s’agit ici s’avère plus précisément celle d’un « retissage par épissures », sans coutures ni nœuds, effectuée, semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement. Elle demande beaucoup de patience et une grande dextérité des doigts. Elle consiste à mettre, tout d’abord, en place les fondations de base et la chaîne. Pour ce faire, soit le tisserand commence par identifier la matière des fibres constituant les fils de chaîne puis se les procure soit il utilise systématiquement des fibres de coton. Ensuite ces fibres sont filées afin d’obtenir l’épaisseur des fils originels puis entortillées avec précaution sur elles mêmes et sur place aux fibres des fils de chaîne extraites de la partie cachée du tissu à réparer. Des fils de remplacement de la trame sont alors placés par dessus et par dessous les fils de chaîne reconstitués puis les fibres sont entortillées sur elles mêmes, là encore avec précaution, aux fibres des fils de trame originels de façon à reproduire très exactement la texture ou le motif du tissu et refermer ainsi, sans faire de nœuds, le trou ou la zone sévèrement cisaillée. Pour finir de rendre cette restauration fil à fil tout à fait invisible et consolider les épissures, une teinture à base de gomme résineuse est appliquée localement sur la trame ainsi reconstruite pour que celle ci, d’où provient l’effet de texture ou de motif, se fonde dans l’original (en l’occurrence la toile jaunie par la patine ivoire des siècles). Cette intervention sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe, si elle est bien réalisée et bien dissimulée, peut réellement être invisible sur les deux faces d’une pièce d’étoffe au point d’échapper parfois même à la main et à l’œil exercés d’une personne du métier qui, à l’œil nu et sous une lumière inadéquate, a tendance à confondre ces reconstructions avec des irrégularités apparues au cours du tissage. De fait, la structure artisanale du lin originel du Linceul, son calibre assez fort ainsi que son tissage serré en chevron sont de nature à parfaitement intégrer ce type d’intervention. Quant à l’échantillon de Zurich (et partant « l’échantillon 1 d’Arizona ») tiré de la partie claire de la bande C14 officielle du Linceul, celui ci bien que ne présentant apparemment pas ou très peu de trace de contamination par une quelconque teinture14, n’en devait pas moins être recouvert d’une patine de microorganismes. De par l’aspect anormale de la zone où il fut prélevé, il suggère fortement, en tout cas, un second type d’intervention indétectable à l’œil nu car effectuée, elle aussi semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement : « un raccommodage à perte ». Cette technique consiste très précisément à insérer, entre les fils de trame et de chaîne, des fils (ici de coton) qui, à chaque fois, sont coupés à leurs deux extrémités sans faire de nœuds, les laissant ainsi littéralement se perdre dans le tissu de lin existant. Ces deux types spécifiques d’intervention (l’une dans le sens d’un remplacement de matière carbonée, l’autre dans celui à la fois d’un remplacement et d’un léger apport) permettraient de rendre compte de la grande dispersion des résultats observée (1238 1407) sur une si petite distance (à peine quatre centimètres de tissu). L’enduit de gomme arabique étant soluble dans l’eau et présent dans cette zone du coin supérieur gauche, il ne pouvait avoir été appliqué sur les fils superficiels des échantillons Raës et C14 qu’après l’incendie de la Sainte Chapelle de Chambéry de 1532. La teinture l’eût elle été avant, celle ci n’aurait pas dissimulé l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole dentelée car l’eau de l’incendie eût entraîné les produits de la pyrolyse locale au cœur des fils. Ce revêtement coloré ajouté tardivement explique l’absence de fluorescence aux UV observée dans cette aire particulière du drap. L’histoire de la conservation du Linceul après 1532 permet donc de dater, d’une manière très précise, au moins une sinon les deux interventions. Seules, en effet, les quatre sœurs clarisses, en 1534, et la princesse Clothilde de Savoie Bonaparte, en 1863, qui intervinrent de façon étendue sur la relique, auraient pu effectuer ce type de réparations invisibles de mains aussi expertes. Les sœurs clarisses s’étant vues confiée la tache bien spécifique de réparer et de consolider la pièce d’étoffe endommagée lors de l’incendie de 1532, la princesse de Savoie Bonaparte s’avère donc être, pour ces travaux délicats de restauration, la candidate la plus hautement probable (aidée ou non en cela du maître tapissier de la cour royale d’alors). Ce d’autant qu’en 1863, cela faisait déjà plus de cinq siècles qu’à chaque ostension à mains nues, la relique se retrouvait être tendue à l’horizontale.” (to be continued) – Vial and Testore just examined the ‘outside edge’ of the untrimmed sample. They didn’t examine the very core of it i.e. The parent sample that was to be incinerated, UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE. (Continuation) “Tout ceci explique (ou expliquerait) pourquoi, lors de la découpe de l’échantillon et faute d’un éclairage adéquat (en lumière UV ou rasante), ces deux variantes locales passèrent totalement inaperçues aux yeux des experts textiles chargés de superviser le prélèvement pour la datation officielle de 1988. Toute leur attention était alors absorbée soit par l’étude technique du drap (qu’ils voyaient pour la toute première fois) soit par la présence gênante des fils de la couture épaisse qui liaient un résidu de la partie supérieure du Linceul au tissu à découper. Ainsi en oublièrent ils de procéder à un examen minutieux du cœur même du site textile à prélever. L’eurent ils examiné, ils n’auraient pu manquer, en effet, d’y repérer la petite reconstruction de forme serpentine, la teinture dissimulant l’extrémité du bord supérieur de la grande auréole d’eau dentelée ainsi que le caractère plus raide et plus sombre de la zone. En principe, une restauration « invisible » ne saurait échapper au compte fil et a fortiori à la binoculaire lorsque l’œil derrière est compétent. Les photos qui montrent les Prs Francesco Testoré et Gabriel Vial († 2005) s’affairant avec divers instruments sont, cependant, on ne peu plus trompeuses en ce qu’elles laissent croire que lesdits experts étaient occupés à des vérifications préliminaires de l’intégrité de ladite zone quand, de fait, leurs vérifications ne furent pas étendues au cœur de l’échantillon mais se bornèrent à la seule lisière du drap. Ainsi croyant avoir libéré l’échantillon aux bords effilochés de tout fil étranger, laissèrent ils à l’opérateur, Giovanni Riggi di Numana († 2008), « le soin » de réduire à une bande rectangulaire un peu plus régulière le rectangle grossier que celui ci, à l’aide de ciseaux de chirurgien, venait d’extraire sans gants protecteurs et plus ou moins malhabilement à la pièce principale. De toute évidence, ce technicien (à qui échut la responsabilité et du choix de l’emplacement et de la prise d’échantillon !) n’était pas expert textile pas plus qu’il n’était carbonologue ou bien archéologue15. Il semblait en effet ignorer à quel point, en matière de radiodatation, la haute technologie de l’Accélérateur Spectromètre de Masse (adaptée pour les mesures sur des microéchantillons) s’avère être sensible aux contaminations y compris à celle du sébum humain. Ce choix d’une zone qui avait fait l’objet, au cours des siècles, de nombreuses manipulations à mains nues lors des ostensions, était donc déjà, de ce seul point de vue, tout sauf judicieux.”.","date":"2015-04-03","mins":"4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"id":"comment-195275","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Charles wrote: “you are depriving your readers of evidence from a textile expert who has examined the Shroud close up.

L’histoire de la conservation du Linceul après 1532 permet donc de dater, d’une manière très précise, au moins une sinon les deux interventions. Seules, en effet, les quatre sœurs clarisses, en 1534, et la princesse Clothilde de Savoie Bonaparte, en 1863, qui intervinrent de façon étendue sur la relique, auraient pu effectuer ce type de réparations invisibles de mains aussi expertes. Les sœurs clarisses s’étant vues confiée la tache bien spécifique de réparer et de consolider la pièce d’étoffe endommagée lors de l’incendie de 1532, la princesse de Savoie Bonaparte s’avère donc être, pour ces travaux délicats de restauration, la candidate la plus hautement probable (aidée ou non en cela du maître tapissier de la cour royale d’alors).

Elle demande beaucoup de patience et une grande dextérité des doigts. Elle consiste à mettre, tout d’abord, en place les fondations de base et la chaîne. Pour ce faire, soit le tisserand commence par identifier la matière des fibres constituant les fils de chaîne puis se les procure soit il utilise systématiquement des fibres de coton. Ensuite ces fibres sont filées afin d’obtenir l’épaisseur des fils originels puis entortillées avec précaution sur elles mêmes et sur place aux fibres des fils de chaîne extraites de la partie cachée du tissu à réparer. Des fils de remplacement de la trame sont alors placés par dessus et par dessous les fils de chaîne reconstitués puis les fibres sont entortillées sur elles mêmes, là encore avec précaution, aux fibres des fils de trame originels de façon à reproduire très exactement la texture ou le motif du tissu et refermer ainsi, sans faire de nœuds, le trou ou la zone sévèrement cisaillée. Pour finir de rendre cette restauration fil à fil tout à fait invisible et consolider les épissures, une teinture à base de gomme résineuse est appliquée localement sur la trame ainsi reconstruite pour que celle ci, d’où provient l’effet de texture ou de motif, se fonde dans l’original (en l’occurrence la toile jaunie par la patine ivoire des siècles). Cette intervention sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe, si elle est bien réalisée et bien dissimulée, peut réellement être invisible sur les deux faces d’une pièce d’étoffe au point d’échapper parfois même à la main et à l’œil exercés d’une personne du métier qui, à l’œil nu et sous une lumière inadéquate, a tendance à confondre cette reconstruction avec des irrégularités apparues au cours du tissage. De fait, la structure artisanale du lin originel du Linceul, son calibre assez fort ainsi que son tissage serré en chevron sont de nature à parfaitement intégrer ce type d’intervention. Quant à l’échantillon de Zurich (et partant « l’échantillon 1 d’Arizona ») tiré de la partie claire de la bande C14 officielle du Linceul, celui ci bien que ne présentant apparemment pas ou très peu de trace de contamination par une quelconque teinture14, n’en devait pas moins être recouvert d’une patine de microorganismes. De par l’aspect anormale de la zone où il fut prélevé, il suggère fortement, en tout cas, un second type d’intervention indétectable à l’œil nu car effectuée, elle aussi semble t il, sous un éclairage rasant et sous une loupe à fort grossissement : « un raccommodage à perte ». Cette technique consiste très précisément à insérer, entre les fils de trame et de chaîne, des fils (ici de coton) qui, à chaque fois, sont coupés à leurs deux extrémités sans faire de nœuds, les laissant ainsi littéralement se perdre dans le tissu de lin existant. Ces deux types spécifiques d’intervention (l’une dans le sens d’un remplacement de matière carbonée, l’autre dans celui à la fois d’un remplacement et d’un léger apport) permettraient de rendre compte de la grande dispersion des résultats observée (1238 1407) sur une si petite distance (à peine quatre centimètres de tissu).
