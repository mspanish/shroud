When we bring refreshment, value, joy and fun to our stakeholders, then we successfully nurture and protect our brands, particularly Coca Cola. That is the key to fulfilling our ultimate obligation to provide consistently attractive returns to the owners of our business. Everything we do is inspired by our enduring mission: To Refresh the World… in body, mind, and spirit. To Inspire Moments of Optimism… through our brands and our actions. To Create Value and Make a Difference… everywhere we engage Well, you know, mutatis mutandis. As usual, it’s hard to put a finger on what exactly an art historian contributes to this world. But if The Coca Cola can get away with refreshing the world… in body, mind, and spirit, or with creating value and making a difference, well, then so can I. I will refresh you and inspire you for moments of optimism with my insights on theology of art in Abrahamic religions. And with many other riveting subjects.” At face value it just sounds great… for Americans, the only snag here is that Coca cola is dangerous with the potential to both cause and aggravate diabetes (risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, weight gain and obesity).and also cause cancer… A most unfortunate comparison to promote one’s blog if you ask me….","date":"2012-06-22","mins":"12:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/13/a-pointless-discussion-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Pointless Discussion of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-18614","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"..the fact is there are many documental similarites and congruences between the Justinian II’s solidus Christ face and Turin Sindon and Manoppello Veil faces..","date":"2012-10-30","mins":"3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/23/a-good-question-about-justinian-ii-coins/","cat":"art","title":"A good question about Justinian II coins"},{"id":"comment-12911","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"A purple patch indeed….","date":"2012-06-22","mins":"1:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/13/a-pointless-discussion-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Pointless Discussion of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-12918","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"To Davor: What do really make of Robert de Clary’s testimony, (La conquête de Constantinople, ch. 92): Et entre ches autres en eut un autre des mousters que on apeloit medame Sainte Marie de Blakerne, ou li sydoines la ou nostres sires fu envelopes, i estoit, qui cascuns desvenres se drechoit tous drois, si que on i pooit bien veir le figure nostre seigneur, ne seut on onques ne Griu ne Franchois que chis sydoines devint, quant le vile fu prise. 1/How then do you translate the old French words “sydoine” & “figure”? 2/How can the French knight write about an alleged mere face shroud/towel “se drechoit tous drois” when most obviously he is speaking of a “sydoine”/synne/sindon”?

Nothing. – What does s/he make of Archaeologist Eugenia Nitowski’s research re temperature inside Yeshua’s tomb? Nothing. – What does s/he make of cyclical daytime to nighttime temperature change? Nothing. – What does s/he make of the possibilty for a specific Judean burial rite including fumigation and resulting in non normal initial temperature condition inside the cave tomb? Nothing. First Reminder: “As a Middle Eastern archaeologist, Nitowski had previously excavated 17 tombs and knew “pretty well what the environment was like,” including the first one she’d ever worked on — a “rolling stone tomb dated to the time of Christ.” While she was working inside, a fellow worker rolled the stone closed, encasing her in stony darkness and silence, she said. She found a bench that lined the walls of the tomb’s central chamber and lay down on it, enjoying the cool stone wall’s feel against her face. As she did so, she thought about the temperature inside and later began digging into literature on the Shroud of Turin and whether anyone had tried to determine the temperature inside Christ’s tomb. A resulting article, “New Evidence May Explain Image on Shroud of Turin,” published in Biblical Archaeology Review, July/August 1986, was co written with a researcher named Joseph Kohlbeck.” Second reminder for Jesterof: The cave tomb Yeshua’s body was laid in, was a stone’s throw from the cross ON the Golgotha mount. (S/he asserts it is ‘written in the Scriptures’ the Golgotha was not Yeshua’s burial place. Really?)..","date":"2013-09-01","mins":"11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42584","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Addendum: Joseph’s cave tomb (= Yeshua’s) had been hewn in the Golgotha mount quarry face side..","date":"2013-09-01","mins":"11:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42520","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"No, really?.","date":"2013-08-31","mins":"4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42594","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Correction: hewn in the Golgotha mount DISUSED OLD quarry face side..","date":"2013-09-01","mins":"12:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42860","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"LOL!.","date":"2013-09-04","mins":"5:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42856","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"JESTEROF, by way of a MOST DELIRIOUS COMMENT wrote: “[…] you neither know correct spelling of the names of the countries, nor ability to listen what is being said.

Now how can anybody want us to believe the image formation process occurred in the middle of the night (or just before sunset) upon resurrection or return to life on the third day after Yeshua’s death when the latter’s body was ALREADY in maximum stiffness upon his very death (on the 1st day) at 3h/3h30 p.m. On the day just before the Great Sabbath (Easter)? Educated Christians should know the peak of rigor mortis normally occurrs from the 12th/13th to the 24th/25th hours after death. In Yeshua’s specific case, his body’s rigor statuaris was at its peak as early as about 3h/3h30 a.m. – about 3h/3h30 p.m. On the following/second day (Judean daytime). This forensic reality is a far cry from what most Christians most wrongly imagine. Forensically speaking, the opinion the TS crucifixion victim’s body was STILL IN MAXIMUM STIFFNESS about 2h30 BEFORE about 3h30 AFTER rigor statuaris should have normally DISAPPEARED, is TOTALLY inconsistent. Maximum stiffness just could NOT have occurred in the middle of the night or any time between the middle of the night and before sunset upon Yeshua’s resurrection or return to life on the third day. Whence, NOBODY should seriously contend the TS image formation process that recorded the crucifixion victim’s body in maximum stiffness occurred sometime on the third day. This is patently untrue. Reminders: Normally maximum stiffnes occurrs about mid way before rigor mortisis sets in and disappears. In Jerusalem and INSIDE a cave tomb hewn in malky rock, the average maximum temperature is 17° C and humidity is very low in spring. In my reconstruction of Yeshua’s burial, the body was dried out via fumigation (to account for a low temperature image colour formation process) in the tomb ante chamber and then placed in supine position inside the sole funerary vaulted niche stone bench on a bed of granulized myrrh (blended myrrh and aloes?) to delay as far as possible the body from putrefying in the burial chamber..","date":"2013-08-25","mins":"6:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/24/an-afterhours-visit-to-the-pontifical-institute-notre-dame-center-in-jerusalem/","cat":"art","title":"An afterhours visit to the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-42006","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Correction (sorry): Educated Christians should know the peak of rigor mortis normally occurrs from the 12th/13th to the 24th/25th hours after death.

Atop this is placed a divided “six” Compartment Meal Plate or Seder tray (“six”/“reversed tailed 3” in Indian script). In Hebrew, it is called qe’arah (“gradalis” in Medieval Latin, in Old Occitan “grasal”.

It is mainly due to having a corpse fin in in a zipped up body bag that was originally too small and cause excessive pressure on the defuncted’s face. ..","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"3:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose"},{"id":"comment-18220","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"+ typo: and has caused.","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose"},{"id":"comment-18222","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"++ typo: deviation (instead of derivation).","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose"},{"id":"comment-18212","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"In terms of additional spy clue, e.g. You rotate the numismtic “three four strands of hair” 90° clockwise then you’ll get the mirrored form of the Greek letter epsilon shaped like TS man’s forehead clot as a BONUS!.","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"2:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose"},{"id":"comment-18225","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: “skewed nose tip”.","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose"},{"id":"comment-18229","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"They may also have specific agendas (e.g. “to clean up” the original swollen Christ face in blood)..","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose"},{"id":"comment-18227","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Shall I endlessly repeazt: Ancient observers/copysts would in fact report as observations and/or copy BOTH what they did really see and what they believed they saw..","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/24/max-patrick-hamon-on-the-skewed-nose/","cat":"art","title":"Max Patrick Hamon on the Skewed Nose"},{"id":"comment-191897","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh, I’d like you very much to EXACTLY locate the nail exit wound in the left hand and highlight its precise edges..","date":"2015-02-26","mins":"11:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/maybe-the-nails-didnt-go-through-the-wrists/","cat":"art","title":"Maybe the Nails Didn’t Go Through the Wrists"},{"id":"comment-192154","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Fernando wrote: “Due to the complex nature of the image of TS, I don’t think noone will be able to give a explaination how the negative image got printed in near future as well.” Actually, I have been able to give one that can account for all the TS image OBJECTIVE characteristics..","date":"2015-03-02","mins":"3:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/maybe-the-nails-didnt-go-through-the-wrists/","cat":"art","title":"Maybe the Nails Didn’t Go Through the Wrists"},{"id":"comment-191820","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Hugh wrote: “the image of the other hand is rather deformed and it is impossible to get sensible measurements off it.” Actually both hand images are relatively deformed (one more than the other).

Besides, shouldn’t the hand images appear somewhat deformed (e.g. With elongated fingers) if we take into account the real possibility for the TS man’s arms to have been forced from adduction to abduction to counteract rigor mortis? It could have resulted in the hands while exerting some increasing pressure, slightly raising up and slipping on the inner side of the burial cloth as the latter got sort of taut again lengthwise while still compressed widthwise by means of outer shorter and/or longer dry shrouds. Whence, the hand image deformation could be the result of this hand to cloth pressure increase during drying/purifying procedure.

I have much higher quality photographic TS face MV face overlaps by Sister Blandina Paschalis Schlömer OCSO that can make my point even clearer (for those who have eyes but still cannot see ; ) ).

The ROUND holes are found in several depictions of the tomb lid as there were actually round holes drilled into the Sepulchre in Jerusalem which were copied by artists.” Actually, it doesn’t take you long to totally miss… two crucial clues: The Turin Shroud INNER SIDE weave pattern looks a herringbone pattern when viewed AT SCALE ONE. However when seen AT MACRO or MAGNIFYING SCALE, the same weave pattern can be drawn in iconic reduction (= for simplification’s sake) as FLAT SQUARE (= non loopy/non semi circular) top stepped pyramid pattern. The Pray codex pen & ink drawing does show the same flat square top stepped pyramid pattern as characteristic weave pattern unit evocative of the TS inner side bearing the image. In medieval times, a protective marble sarcophagus with portholes used to protect the unction stone. In the Entombment of Jesus, by Nicholas of Verdun (1130–1205) in Klosterneuburg Abbey, this is precisely this sarcophagus type that cryptically features Yeshua’s burial bench.The two series of 4 5 SMALL round holes are NOT the portholes “drilled into the Sepulchre in Jerusalem” AT ALL.

(…) Methinks Fundamentalism and Arrogance are father and mother of Ignorance.” For the earliest depiction (586 CE) of the flat square top stepped pyramid pattern in conjunction with both Yeshua’s crucifixion AND EMPTY TOMB scenes, see the earliest crucifixion in an illuminated manuscript, from the Rabbula Gospels, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence, Italy Re earliest (symbolic) depiction of the blackened rimmed burn holes, on October 16, 2013 at 10:24 am I wrote: “For another 390 400 CE mosaic cryptically and symbolically featuring the blackened rimmed burn holes, see the Santa Pudenziana apse mosaic of Christ in majesty: black L (for Lumens Christi) marks the latter’s pallium (= Greek himation, a very large rectangle of fabric that can be draped as a shawl, a cloak, or a head covering; a current 4,20×1,40m for a 5ft 9 6ft tall man was the correct size; size much like the TS)”..","date":"2014-06-13","mins":"8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/12/navy-seals-at-the-battle-of-gettysburg-a-picture-of-the-shroud-in-1036/","cat":"art","title":"Navy Seals at the Battle of Gettysburg?

In the lower panel (visitatio), this is the reverse: Yeshua’s shroud weave (along with the relic’s many red crossed backing cloth) is copied (simplified drawing implying very close examination of the warp side bering the image) but body image is left out. Optically speaking, the 12th drawing does make sense under actual conditions of observations as the Shroud body image seems virtually to disappear like mist/completely the closer you step to it (namely within three paces) and reappears when you step back (namely beyond three paces). This is additional evidence if not proof. Charles TOTALLY missed it since his mind is set! On September 6, 2013 at 12:54 pm, Hugh wrongly wrote: “I agree that the zig zag pattern on the lid of the Pray manuscript tomb, and the crosses all over the body of it, are (sic) NOTHING TO DO (my upper cases) with the shroud.” the fact is I have crucial iconographic evidence to the contrary I will send Dan by e mail to post in his blog as soon as I’ll have time to write away a flash illustrative reply. Hugh also wrongly wrote: “[…] I think the illustration derives, second, third or fourth hand, from the marble surround of the holy sepulchre, and the apertures in it. The peculiar diagonal line of crosses might even be an attempt to depict a corner.” As if, through copying one the other, the much larger port holes “drilled into the Sepulchre in Jerusalem” could have turned into two sets of SMALL 4 5 black rimmed holes and the said sets still not be strongly evocative at all of the TS sets of blackened rimmed burn holes!?.","date":"2014-06-14","mins":"7:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/12/navy-seals-at-the-battle-of-gettysburg-a-picture-of-the-shroud-in-1036/","cat":"art","title":"Navy Seals at the Battle of Gettysburg?

The epitaphios or “(liturgical shroud) on the tomb” depicting the dead body of Christ is solemnly venerated for a last time and then ceremoniously taken into the altar and laid on the Holy Table towards the end of the canon. After the dismissal of the midnight office all the lights in the church are extinguished except for the unsleeping flame on the Holy Table (altar), and all wait in silence and darkness. Where possible, the Holy Light arrives from the Holy Sepulchre during Holy Saturday afternoon and it is used to light anew the unsleeping flame. At the “time for matins”,usually in practice at the stroke of midnight, the priest censes around the Holy Table, and lights his candle from the unsleeping flame. The Holy Doors are opened, after which the priest exclaims “Come receive the light from the light that is never overtaken by night, and glorify Christ, Who is risen from the dead!” or a similar variation depending on tradition.

On April 3, 2014 (at 10:27 am), I wrote: Actually Colin Berry is just recycling one of my own ideas to fit in his scorch theory like speculation. I first drew his attention to the Saint Lawrence and Turin Shroud issue as early as February 2013. – First on February 25, 2013 at 3:43 pm, in CB’s blog, I wrote: “The Old french vocable graal is translated « grail » into English (le saint graal : the holy grail). Now the old French word «graal» is very close to the Old French « grail » that means grid and metallic lattice from Latin cratis. The French verb « griller/to roast » was spelt i Old French « graailler »; notice the two « a » as in graal.” “The ‘grid/grail theme’ is also to be found in an Irish Fairy Tale telling Tuân mac Cairill’s turning into The Primeval Man (Adam Qadmon = Yeshua Ha Ben Adam) within him (notice too how Cairill wordplays with Grail): “The fisherman of Cairill, the King of Ulster, took me in his net. Ah, that was a happy man when he saw me! He shouted for joy when he saw the great salmon in his net. “I was still in the water as he hauled delicately. I was still in the water as he pulled me to the bank. My nose touched air and spun from it as from fire, and I dived with all my might against the bottom of the net, holding yet to the water, loving it, mad with terror that I must quit that loveliness. But the net held and I came up. “‘Be quiet, King of the River,’ said the fisherman, ‘give in to Doom,’ said he. “I was in air, and it was as though I were in fire. The air pressed on me like a fiery mountain. It beat on my scales and scorched them. It rushed down my throat and scalded me. It weighed on me and squeezed me, so that my eyes felt as though they must burst from my head, my head as though it would leap from my body, and my body as though it would swell and expand and fly in a thousand pieces. “The light blinded me, the heat tormented me, the dry air made me shrivel and gasp; and, as he lay on the grass, the great salmon whirled his desperate nose once more to the river, and leaped, leaped, leaped, even under the mountain of air. He could leap upwards, but not forwards, and yet he leaped, for in each rise he could see the twinkling waves, the rippling and curling waters. “‘Be at ease, O King,’ said the fisherman. ‘Be at rest, my beloved. Let go the stream. Let the oozy marge be forgotten, and the sandy bed where the shades dance all in green and gloom, and the brown flood sings along.’ “And as he carried me to the palace he sang a song of the river, and a song of Doom, and a song in praise of the King of the Waters. “When the king’s wife saw me she desired me. I was put over a fire and roasted, and she ate me. And when time passed she gave birth to me, and I was her son and the son of Cairill the king. I remember warmth and darkness and movement and unseen sounds. All that happened I remember, from the time I was on the gridiron until the time I was born. I forget nothing of these things.” “And now,” said Finnian, “you will be born again, for I shall baptize you into the family of the Living God.”————–So far the story of Tuan, the son of Cairill.” Now the Greek word for fish (ICHTUS), works nicely as an acronym/acrostic for “Ίησοῦς Χριστός, Θεοῦ Υἱός, Σωτήρ”, (Iēsous Christos, Theou Yios, Sōtēr), which translates into English as “Jesus Christ, God’s Son, Saviour”). Besides the fish on the grid with the flames raging underneath is an alchemical image of Chymische Schriften by J.J. Hollandus published in 1773 in Vienna. “Léon Gineste rappelle que l’écuelle de terre qui constitue le troisième et dernier étage de l’athanor alchimique est nommé grassal – une des étymologies du mot graal est gresal. C’est pendant la phase de coagula que, dans ce troisième étage, la pierre est retournée afin que toutes ses faces soient cuites. Le terme griller se rapporte à cette cuisson”. (see http://www.nonagones.info/correlation geometrique geographique.php?depl1=Partie+VI+ +Le+carr%E9+SATOR&ph=F1010301.jpg) If Colin Berry still doesn’t understand the optical reason why HE THINKS HE SEES “un homme grillé à petit feu/a slow roasted man” in the TS man image, just let him pray Saint Lawrence (or saint Vincent) for it, saint Cecil (or saint Pareidolia) too…” – Then on October 16, 2013 at 9:53 am | #12 Reply | I first wrote in DP’s blog: “Re CB being the victim of grail/grid “semblance and avision”, is another good example of RE EXPERIENCED archaeopareidolia…” “Actually the first “CRYPTIC SYMBOLICAL” rendering of the ‘visionary experience’ of a man been slowly roasted while the observer was looking at the burial Shroud (now kept in Turin) dates back to the first half of the 5th C. CE (see the Maryrdom of St Lawrence mausoleum of Gallia Placidia, Ravenna).

Actually the two small wheels cryptically feature two of the four somewhat round scorch marks/water stains in conjunction with the 4 series of smaller burn marks & holes one can still see off the TS body image.” A few Art Historians saw in the nimbused figure in the mosaic not so much saint Lawrence as Christ himself. Notice the two Gammadia on “saint Lawrence”‘s garment are not two capital “L”s but two capital “I”s for Iesus, Yeshua, which tends to prove wrong CB’s casual reading (“It would be L for (St.) Lawrence”) “Actually, in the Ravenna mosaic the gridiron grate leg rings (about 5cm in diameter) are about twice smaller in diameter than expected and look more like small wheels. Now the roundish scorch marks/water stains in conjunction with the 4 series of symmetrical burn holes and marks on the TS, are about 5cm in diameter too. This is both a spy clue and a de rhyming pattern in the composition (to read in conjunction with the gridiron grate’s Γ (Gamma)/horizontally mirrored L shaped corners)”. “Most likely the original size of the bloodied body long burial cloth (TS) was 111x436cm not 113x444cm, present size. Hence folding shall be adapted to get about 28x27cm square folding marks all over the cloth surface (and conjure up an archaeopareidoliac grate image in conjunction with roundish scorch marks/water stains as pareidolia of wheels + blood belt as pareidola of raging flames under a gridiron grate).” “There is another late 11th early 12th/mid 12th c. CE Shroud like cryptic Martydom of Saint Vincent/Lawrence being roasted on a grate by Benedictine Abbot mural artist (Hugh of Cluny (1049 1109)?) See his designed programme of mural paintings in the Cluniac chapel of Berzé la Ville in Burgundy). ” Notice in the latter depiction, saint Vincent/Lawrence grid pattern: mirrored and non mirrored L/Γ (Gamma) shaped series of geometrical small circles. Notice the intriguing ‘circular bind’ around the hands and take a look at the TS man’s hand image area… “Actually Saint Vincent and Saint Lawrence are currently mistaken one for the other. (They both embody the Chistian’s profession of Faith in “Jesus Christ, God’s Son, Saviour” i.e. The ICHTUS, “the Fish”). – Then again on October 16, 2013 at 5:24 pm | my #23 Reply |, I wrote in DP’s blog: “(…) can Colin Berry) “scientifically” recognized a naked Templar by means of the head on the Lirey Pilgrim badge? Is that what he calls circumstantial evidence? A medieval observer taking a look at the Lirey Pilgrim badge, would have either recognized the Holy Shroud or mistaken the naked man for Saint Lawrence or Saint Vincent (not a Knight Templar)!”. Can Colin Berry discriminate between saint Lawrence and saint Vicent? He just cannot. Can he discriminate between knight Templars such as De Molay, De Charny, De Craon, De Goneville, De Payraud etc, he just cannot either. – Then again on October 16, 2013 at 5:30 pm |my #26 Reply |, I wrote: “Addendum regarding Colins Berry’s biased opinion: Jacques de Molay and Geoffrroi de Charney were burned at the stakes KNELT AND IN TH Ei R SHIRTS (and not stark naked) not on a gridirion grate like Saint Lawrence and Saint Vincent!” Then again on October 16, 2013 at 7:10 pm | my #29 Reply |: “Reminder: Saints who died in imitation of Christ’s self sacrifice and martyrdom (i.e. In imitatio Christi) could be depicted with Christ like and even at times Shroud like characteristic traits AND/OR (pareidoliac) attributes whence the iconosteganographic depictions of e.g. Saint Lawrence (in Ravenna, early 5th c.

From a pratical standpoint, to save time and ressources, Yeshua’s 4 6 buriers used, as a stretcher, a short ladder (the very same ladder used to take him down from the cross and transport it to the tomb near by) (along with a much larger shroud much like the Kornelimünster Sudarium Domini?). A short ladder and/or a more larger shroud are indeed BETTER CANDIDATES to do the job than an up and over long and narrow rectangle of linen secured with temporary ties to accommodate a corpse and transport it near by.

The latest mention of the custom is by the second century CE Latin author Apuleius (Metamorphoses VI:18). In the classical theme, the obol, or a low value copper coin in general, should be placed in the mouth of the deceased immediately after death.The archaeological record provides us with a wealth of coins found in tombs but it would be incorrect to associate all of them with this custom. Indeed, at least in Greece, the custom of providing the dead with coins is older than the mythological tradition of Charon (Stevens 1991:227). It seems that the custom underwent considerable changes in the Roman and Byzantine periods. Originally, Charon’s obol was placed in the mouth or clenched between the teeth; in later burials, we ﬁnd COINS PLACED ON THE EYES or in the hand (Stevens 1991:225).here were also changes as to when the coin was placed (at death or upon burial) and the number of coins. Charon did not exist in the Roman religious tradition. (…) coins cannot be deﬁnitively associated with the custom (Charon’s obol), even if found near the body, and are usually recorded as ‘grave offerings’ (…) coins were found in the mouth of the deceased at Gesher Ha Ziv(Mazar 1994:78, eight examples) and Lohame Ha Geta’ot (Peleg 1991:133, four examples); clenched between the teeth at Nahariyya (Barag 1986:399) and Mampsis (Negev 1971:119); PLACED ON THE EYES at Hurfeish (Shaked 2000) and ‘En Boqeq (Gichon 1970:139); or held in the hand, as at Lohame Ha Geta’ot (Peleg1991:133).” Actually, even Charon’s obol could be placed on the eyes (early in the second century CE). Most likely hellenistic Judeans revisited the custom and adapt it to Judean burials to make “silent eulogies” as coin rebus (a kind of word puzzle that uses coin devices and legends –here Hebrew and Aramaicl wordplays from Greek– to represent words or parts of words or else trigger off a biblical verse or funerary formula in Hebrew.

I may understand your sheer inability to mentally relate the folded in two long burial cloth (featured in simplified iconic pen & ink drawing in the Pray ms Three Mary scene) with the Turin Shroud characteristic inner side flat square top stepped weave pattern it represents. However, I just can’t help wondering how can one casually refute what he cannot even understand? This is just beyond me! Besides, I wish you had more than just remotely heard of visual double and even at times triple entendre in reference to Benedictine monk (& nun) Art of cryptography and steganography before passing your comments. You wrote: “I THINK (upper cases mine) it is an iconic reduction (glad you finally make the phrase yours) of the concentric irregular semicircles one frequently finds on onyx slabs”. You may ONLY be right to a far stretched or very surrealistic extent since, at best, this is a “skeleton reading key” (do hope you can understand the phrase). STILL, I very much would like you to SHOW me HOW can a FLAT SQUARE top stepped PYRAMID design can REALLY BE RECOGNIZABLE as a rather accurate iconic reduction of “concentric irregular SEMICIRCLES one FREQUENTLY finds on onyx slabs (upper cases mine)”. SURREALISTIC thinking is neither FAC Tually demonstrating nor FAC Tually proving anything. Hence I am waiting for an iconographic demonstration/proof in the state of the Art via a series of AD HOC illustrations. Could you email it to Dan for the latter to publish it on his blog or forward it to me, please? Thank you. To the initiated eye, the TRUE iconographic FACT is, the Pray codex FLAT SQUARE top stepped PYRAMID design is first and foremost an iconic reduction of the Shroud inner side weave pattern seen at macro or “magnifying scale”. I myself can and will demonstrate and prove it with a series of ad hoc illustrations. It will be a major iconographic confirmation the Pray codex Benedictine monk artist DID cryptically featured the famous relic (in close conjunction with a cross field evocative of both the Holy Sepulchre cross graffiti panels and Byzantine liturgy via a reference to the Byzantine church liturgical garment known as polystaurion ‘many crossed’). Re visual double– and triple entendre, the TWO RED BLOOD like WIGGLY LINES are to read in close conjunction with the Resurrection angel (Saint Michael)’s inner RED BLOOD like garment lower left hem SIDE that shows and stands out as a RED BLOOD like SPOT/STAIN on the long burial cloth lying flat on the sarcophagus lid. Iconographically speaking, the long burial shroud DOES make wrinkles and rumples as the heaven messenger tramples on it with his left foot. Saint Michael is here to be read as a Yeshua’s Victory over Death or “anasthasia” allegory ((“He is not here”, “He is risen from the dead”). While the RED BLOOD like SPOT/STAIN and TWO RED BLOOD like WIGGLY LINES read in conjunction with the characteristic weave pattern are “cryptically evocative” of the side wound associated with two long blood rivulets respectively observable on the Turin Shroud frontal and dorsal images.

Are we looking at the same miniature (see Pray codex lower register, fol 28)? Besides you wrote: “No, sorry, Max, I still can’t agree. […] the zig zags […] look NOTHING AT ALL (upper cases mine) like Giorgio Tessiore’s drawing”. CAN YOU REALLY READ ME? I NEVER wrote Tessiore’s very realistic pen and ink drawing looks EXACTLY like the Benedictine monk artist’s simplified iconic drawing of the same object namely the TS inner side weave pattern, I wrote: “the TS weave pattern that bears the image when (pen &) ink drawn at macrolevel AND IN ICONIC REDUCTION (upper cases mine) is far more evocative of the Pray codex FLAT square top stepped pyramid design than any ink drawn predominantly white marble onyx irregular concentric looped patterned slab one could ever found on earth This is an iconographic fact […].” Methinks you STILL either cannot correctly discriminate between the inner side weave pattern that bears the image and that of the outer side (actually they just DON’T look the same) OR you just don’t know what the phrase “IN ICONIC REDUCTION” really means OR BOTH. The latter phrase refers to the graphic artist’s ability (here the Pray ms Benedictine monk’s) to have the viewer mentally relate a simplified iconic drawing to the object it represents. Here the Pray ms Benedictine monk’s pen & ink drawing DOES/CAN look a simplified version of Tessiore’s. This is an iconographic FACT whether you like it or not, whether you non initiated eye can see it or not at first sight. Hugh, you can be wrong in your opinion, you just cannot be wrong in your iconographic fact. You cannot either just disagree with me on the sole basis you just missed the meaning of the key phrase here: “in iconic reduction”. First get informed or ask me to clarify the meaning it really covers if you ignore it. I also very much like to know how you integrate the red blood like spot and two red blood like streaks standing out on your zigzagged marble onyx sarcophagus slab. Do you seriously think they are just ‘RANDOM decorative patterns’ too? Are you kidding? Have you ever heard of Medieval Benedictine work? Methinks you are totally unaware of the Benedictine monk artist’s cryptic/symbolically laden way of drawing. In a couple of days (it’s very busy around here at the moment) I’ll email Dan an illustrative reply for you et al to see what I really mean about the basic “sameness” of 1996 Tessiore’s and the 1180s Benedictine monk artist’s pen & ink drawings of the TS inner side weave pattern. Hope Dan will publish it to dispel any misrepresentation of my opinion or biased reading of the Pray codex lower register miniature. Reminder One: in conjunction with the headdress, Yeshua’s folded in two long burial cloth is featured here as if both lying on and in the guise of a zigzagged marble/onyx displaced slab of a red cross covered sarcophagus. The skeleton reading key (or 1st degree reading level to the uninitiated eye) just mask here a deeper reading level (or reading level to the initiated eye). It is triggered by the cryptic evocation of the Holy Sepulchre (through the famous cross graffiti covered wall on the way down to the chapel of St Helena or up the HS) and a few spy clues (flat square top stepped pyramid pattern, two series of small holes, red blood like spot in conjunction with two red blood like streaks). Reminder Two: in the miniature, only three crosses (not dozens!) are shown as if displaced in diagonal line. Actually more than once, three crosses DO look slightly displaced and as if in diagonal line amid hundreds of horizontally well lined crosses carved into the said wall by medieval pilgrims.

First the deceased eyes were closed or covered. Solely the long inner burial sindon (Heb. Sovev) was moistened with alkaline waters. Then it was tautly wrapped lengthwise around the stiff rigid body while the legs and torso were tightly wrapped up widthwise with two long linen strips and/or a shawl (Heb. Thalith) and the head tightly wrapped up (on top of the sovev) with a veil and a skullcap to both honour the deceased and counteract the head rigor mortis and keep the mouth shut (three wooden pieces were used to make a “small jaw box ” in conjunction with the two burial head dresses) During the image formation process, the sovev didn’t quite return to its natural size and shape as it got sort of taut again lengthwise through shrinking. The uneven recording of the two arms imprint on the inner side of the burial cloth is due to the fact the deceased’s arms had been forced in rigor mortis from adduction to abduction thus creating sort of a counter pressure to wrapping up pressure. This resulted in a specific image distortion not to be extended to the whole body imprint. The ritual fumigation allowed the latent body imprint to be revealed on the long inner ancient burial cloth..","date":"2012-09-11","mins":"7:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-16137","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Mistyping: the deceased’s eyes.","date":"2012-09-11","mins":"7:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-15926","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Correction: a HIMATION (a CLOTH/SINDON about 4 5m long and 1.20 1.40m wide).","date":"2012-09-06","mins":"6:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-16138","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"+ mistyping: The ritual fumigation allowed the latent body imprint to be revealed ONTO the long inner ancient burial cloth..","date":"2012-09-11","mins":"7:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-15924","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"How can you be so sure the Edessa mage is “a small LINEN cloth”?.","date":"2012-09-06","mins":"6:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-16166","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"David Mo you wrote: “How this vaporous Shroud can influence all the cultural world of the 13th and before?”.

Here are my comments: To answer Falcinelli’s question (“The Veil of Manoppello: work of art or authentic relic?”), I would say it is BOTH. My opinion actually is it is a mussel silk veil that most probably was ingeniously dyed with natural rust and grey lead very fine powder mixed with water + ammonia present in human sweat. It was meant to complete/enhance pre existing blood stains and facial pressure imprint left on a genuine burial relic of Yeshua: the byssus sudarium that was placed and pressed on top of the Sindon enshrouding his head on burial. (This “sudarium” shall not be mistaken for two other famous sudarii namely the pre burial Sudaruim of Oviedo and the skull cap/headdress of Cahors). I challenge Falcinelli (and anybody) to try and demonstrate/convince any Art Historian worth his salt that the present official Veronica is the same relic that became popular in 1208 when Innocent III chose to have the Veronica processed in a reliquary of gold, silver and gems through the streets of Rome. The Veronica Veil II disappeared/was stolen during Charles V’s “sack” of Rome in 1527 CE and unofficially resurfaced in Manoppello in 1608 CE. Falcinelli claimed it is ‘a 16th c. Painting’a and, what is more, the self portrait which Dürer then gave to Raphael and « painted in water colours, on byssus, so fine that it was transparent, and finished without using white lead, the fabric itself serving for the whites and the fine threads being used to represent the hairs of the beard/to form the lights of the picture, and when held up to the light it was transparent all over ». If so, could Falcinelli answer the following questions : 0/How can the written source (Vasari) he relies on tells it is a self portait by Dürer and then, « on Falcinelli’s personal careful iconographic analysis », the painting turned out to be a self portrait by Raphael ? This is rather confusing if not suspect to say the least. 1/Can he forensically and conclusively demonstrate the Durer’s and Manopello Veil Man’s features perfectly match ? 2/ How could Dürer have “painted” it when already ca 1430 CE (i.e. More than a century and half beforehand), the Master of Flémalle had already painted the same Manoppello Veil aka Veronica on oakwood? 4/How could Dürer have “painted” the Face “in” the Manoppello Byssus Veil when marine Byssus/mussel silk definitely just cannot be painted but only dyed? 5/Does he know of any other similar piece of art be still extant? Re conclusive material identification of Manoppello Veil with pre 1527 Rome Veronica, true material facts are still to be fully cross investigated namely – the very Veronica reliquary of the 1350 Jubilee, with its broken glass panes still preserved in St. Peter’s treasure as it was reported (by Dobschütz) to still retain in its very frame a piece of transparent cloth. – the piece of glass (reported by Pfeiffer) to still stuck on the veil..","date":"2013-02-25","mins":"8:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/25/the-art-of-the-impossible/","cat":"art","title":"The Art of the Impossible?"},{"id":"comment-25760","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"++ Addendum: the risk would be to open the Manoppello Veil monstrance as the latter has not been opened since the vey day it was put between the two glass panes i.e. Since the first mid 17th C.E..","date":"2013-02-26","mins":"4:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/25/the-art-of-the-impossible/","cat":"art","title":"The Art of the Impossible?"},{"id":"comment-25688","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: to be still stuck on the veil.","date":"2013-02-25","mins":"8:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/25/the-art-of-the-impossible/","cat":"art","title":"The Art of the Impossible?"},{"id":"comment-40348","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Matthias, 100% agreed all the more so as the Turin Shroud image SHOULD be read in the light of the Book/Scroll of Revelation archaeopareidoliac visions..","date":"2013-08-03","mins":"11:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/03/the-enthronement-of-otto-iii/","cat":"art","title":"The Enthronement of Otto III"},{"id":"comment-40491","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Actually, this is BOTH a cryptic symbolic representation of Yeshua’s long Shroud unfolded and an unrolled scroll in conjunction with the four living creatures and Otto’s throne.

In Mark, it more precisely refers to inner clothing worn next to the young man’s skin as outer clothing on that time of night as if he had known about Rabbi Yeshua’s extra muros hideaway and hurried out of his house in Jerusalem on hearing of Yeshua’s oncoming arrest. In the Second Temple period, gardeners used to work in undergarment (i.e. In sindon or sadin).

E.g., in a previous post (January 7, 2012 at 11:12 am | #12), I gave my own personal explanation to Matthew 27:53 to account for saints coming out of their tombs after Rabbi Yeshua’ resurrection: “In the Second Temple period, it was rather usual for both possessed and holy men to live an eremitic live in grottoes or DESUSED TOMBS. If we half rule out here the use of a literary device (dramatic emphasis) by Matthew, this is the best solution, in my eyes, we are left with to historically account for this long misunderstood passage”… Now please, do read the interpretation the German rationalists and their followers gave to Matthew 27:53. You also wrote: “I believe caution must be exercised in interpreting every line of scripture.” All the more so with the Gospels as a Hebrew/Aramaic substratum is to be taken into account. Now, “German rational exegetes” and their followers tend to totally ignore the Greek, here, might well be a translation Greek from former notes taken down in Hebrew and Aramaic. Do you still think German rational exegetes and yourself (as their follower) so cautious “in interpreting every line of scripture”? Then you added: “John is certainly concerned with Jewish practices, his intended audience appears for the most part to be Jewish Christians”. Actually they are not so much Jewish as JUDEAN practices (as opposed to Galilean or Samaritan practices of the Second Temple period). What about the caution you just said must be exercised? The Gospel of John was written well BEFORE the Temple was destroyed (70 CE) whereas “German rationalists” and their followers still interpret John’s Gospel as if it had been written at the end of the 1st century CE! Are “the Markans” so cautious to completely rule out the possibility? You should read Genot Bismuth’s brilliant exegesis and archaeology of John’s Gospel!

Re Daniel Milberg’s “US image alchemy”, the latter can be deciphered as a non intended/intended pun on the Arabic al qawmiyya, ‘nationalism”, Arabic Al Qyama, “Resurrection” and Aramaic Qyama, ‘Resurrection” in subliminal reference to Al Qaida and the “9.11 trauma” (word play on the Aramaic Toma, “Twin” as in the phrase “Twin Towers” and image play with two dollar bank notes featuring two portraits of American leaders as if they were twins). The blimp actually is about to pierce (with its red nose) one side of the hangar as a digital image substitute for the Turin Shroud wound side (re Thomas’s incredulity). Besides “The Balloon Hoax”, another of Poe’s stories is here to be used as a deciphering key: “The Fall of the (Free Mason/brick layer) House of Usher” as the blimp is about to come out/usher out; see the red car(pet)mac/tarmac, apocope de tarmacadam. Now “mac adam” literally means “son of man” in subliminal reference once more to Yeshua Ha Nostry/”Jesus the Nazorean”. Thus the image can be described as Daniel Milberg’s “Fall of the Hangar of Usher” as the latter, not unlike a money box/hoax, made half of cards half of “greens” showing two Free Masons faces, is doomed to collapse as “The Shroud of Turin” takes off from the red carpetmac/tarmacadam.. Reminder here: The Hebrew name Daniyyel (“Daniel”) means “God is my judge” and is the name of a Hebrew prophet.

Methinks there are subtleties you currently missed when it come to the TS image analysis. YOU do have a tunnel vision and many a blind spot as far as image analysis and cryptanalysis is concerned. To Hugh: Re Cyrus Smith as the PERFECT anagram of M(aran) Y(e)Sh U’ CHRIST or M(aran) Y(e)SHU’ CRIST. This is a cryptographic FACT you just cannot deny, whether you like it or not. In the French original version, Cyrus Smith IS the name Jukes Verne gave to the Engineer NOT “Cyrus Harding” that appears ONLY in a few faulty English translations. Because I mechanically copied and pasted a FLAWED Enligsh translation of a passage of L’ILE MYSTERIEUSE, Cyrus Smith, which the TRUE name of the engineer in the French original version, MISLEADINGLING appears mistranslated as “Cyrus Harding”. The WRONG NAME is not my doing. This is the translator’s. In other words is NOT in my list of comments stricto sensu, it is a quote from a FLAWED English translation. Had the blog language been French, such a mistranlation could not have occurred. I said it again: CYRUS SMITH (which IS the TRUE name Jules Verne gave to his hero) is the PERFECT ANAGRAM of M(aran) Y(e)Sh U’ CHRIST or M(aran) Y(e)SHU’ CRIST, “Our Lord Jesus Christ”. T His is a cryptographic fact. This cryptographic system known as LE LANGAGE DES OISEAUX (the language of the birds) dates back to KING SALOMON. Shall I repeat they are many an example Jules Verne did use the Rosicrucian cryptographic system known as The Language of the Birds. Reminder re Rosicrucianism: Solomon’s proverbial wisdom was due to his being granted understanding of the language of the birds and practice of secrecy. Reminder of the Rosicrucian manifesto incipit: “Wisdom (saith Solomon) is to a man an infinite Treasure, for she is the Breath of the Power of God, and a pure Influence that floweth from the Glory of the Almighty; she is the Brightness of Eternal Light, and an undefiled Mirror of the Majesty of God, and an Image of his Goodness; she teacheth us Soberness and Prudence, Righteousness and Strength; she understands the Subtilty of words, and Solution of dark sentences; she foreknoweth Signs and Wonders, and what shall happen in time to come; with this Treasure was our first Father Adam fully endued: Hence it doth appear, that after God had brought before him all the Creatures of the Field, and the Fowls under Heaven, he gave to every one of them their proper names, according to their nature.” It then proceeds: “Although now through the sorrowful fall into sin this excellent Jewel Wisdom hath been lost, and meer Darkness and Ignorance is come into the World, yet notwithstanding hath the Lord God sometimes hitherto bestowed, and made manifest the same, to some of his Friends: For the wise King Solomon doth testifie of himself, that he upon earnest prayer and desire did get and obtain such Wisdom of God, that thereby he knew how the World was created, thereby he understood the Nature of the Elements, also the time, beginning, middle and end, the increase and decrease, the change of times through the whole Year, the Revolution of the Year, and Ordinance of the Stars; he understood also the properties of tame and wilde Beasts, the cause of the raigning of the Winds, and minds and intents of men, all sorts and natures of Plants, vertues of Roots, and others, was not unknown to him. Now I do not think that there can be found any one who would not wish and desire with all his heart to be a Partaker of this noble Treasure; but seeing the same Felicity can happen to none, except God himself give Wisdom, and send his holy Spirit from above, we have therefore set forth in print this little Treatise, to wit, Famam & Confessionem, of the Laudable Fraternity of the Rosie Cross, to be read by every one, because in them is clearly shewn and discovered, what concerning it the World hath to expect (…).” The influence of Rosicrucianism can be felt all through JV’s work for the one who has ears to hear, eyes to see and brain to think. It not just for the blind and deaf common readers but first and foremost for the wide and understanding reader or the “uncommon one”. Rosicrucians are promoting a “Universal Reformation of Mankind”, (the “Rosicrucian Enlightenment”). The fact is it can be felt in every and all JV’s novel(s) (just think of the famous the Vernian “Reformed Club” (R+ C)). Besides the true fact IS many an esoteric society have claimed to derive their doctrines, in whole or in part, from the original Rosicrucians. According to Tarade, most likely the Rosicrucian Pierrre Piquelin co opted Jules Verne. Reminder for Hugh: my “deliberations” are rooted in a work of fiction, Rosicrucian literature, Christian refrential texts, a cryptographic system (or phonetic & etymological Qabbalah) dating back to the Time of King Salomon, a Secret Order known as the Rose Cross and an archaeological document know as the Turin Shroud..","date":"2015-02-09","mins":"4:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-190348","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"…The Turin Shroud, as an archaeological document, still shows “the Dew of the Cross” (or Ros Crucis as Mysterium Crucis); the Mystery of the Cross..","date":"2015-02-09","mins":"5:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-190344","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: It not just for the blind and deaf common readers but first and foremost for the WISE and understanding reader not to mention the “uncommon one”..","date":"2015-02-09","mins":"5:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-190351","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Re King Solomon’s WISDOM (SOPHIA in Greek): in Atbash Cipher (which is part and parcel of the Language of the Birds): Let’s read Schoenfield: “(Atbash Cipher) is a Hebrew code which substitutes the first letter of the alphabet for the last and the second letter for the second last and so on.

BTW Thibault do you recommend probiotics or antibiotics to your patient? Here is the article from which the quote is taken: “It is ironic that this humbled fungus, hailed as a benefactor of mankind, may by its very success prove to be a deciding factor in the decline of the present civilization.” ~Dr. John I. Pitt, The Genus Penicillum, Academic Press, 1979 Antibiotics are indiscriminate killers of bacteria. Not only do they kill “bad” bacteria but the beneficial bacteria that live in the intestines as well. This imbalance of organisms can cause a disruption of digestion, decreasing our ability to properly absorb nutrients from foods, and makes us more vulnerable to pathogens, especially yeast. These unfriendly organisms rapidly repopulate the gastrointestinal tract and wreak havoc, causing additional infections that can occur in almost any region or organ of the body. Our good bacteria makes up 75% of our immune system and is our first line of defense against illness. Think of it as our home land security. Each time we take an antibiotic, we are “taking out” a good portion of this security and leaving ourselves open to further assaults. Doing this over and over again results is declining health. We’ve all run to the doctors from time to time when we’ve not felt well. Often times we end up leaving the doctor’s office with a prescription for an antibiotic even if that wasn’t what was needed to resolve our current health problem. Antibiotics given for viral infections such as the common cold, upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis are pointless because antibiotics do not kill viral infections. However, doctors may resort to giving antibiotics so the patient won’t leave empty handed or because the patient is adamant that this is what is needed. Either way, this is a prescription for disaster. Antibiotic resistance is becoming a major concern and is increasing worldwide. Here in the US we take an estimated 133 million antibiotic prescriptions per year, according to the government accounting office. A full ½ of these prescriptions are not needed according to current estimates. Many of these are given to fight viral infections. Although there use in humans is the biggest contributor of antibiotic resistance, it has been reported that 70% of the antibiotics produced in the USA each year are fed to our livestock (pigs, chickens, and cattle). This information is cause for further concern. Is the excessive use of antibiotics connected to escalating rates of illness (esp. Autoimmune diseases) in the US and throughout the world? There are some experts that think there is indeed a connection. Antibiotics in Livestock Antibiotics have been used extensively in agriculture since the 1960s. Most are not given for disease prevention, but as growth promoters. Healthy farm animals are estimated to receive an astounding 50% to 70% of all antibiotics produced in the US. The practice of giving livestock antibiotics has also come under scrutiny from those who believe that it does increase the likelihood of antibiotic resistance in humans. Could eating meat and poultry from animals that have been given antibiotics ultimately affect our good bacteria and lead to yeast overgrowth? The jury is still out on that one, but there are experts who believe this trend could be a threat to our health! Lets not forget that animals today are often given growth hormones as well. Breast cancer and other cancers are on the rise. Could antibiotics and growth hormones given to fatten cattle and other livestock be partially responsible for the increased cancer statistics? Again, some think so!

As such they lead to serious health risks. Max Planck who won the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics, once weighed in as to why science is slow to change even in the presence of overwhelming evidence that it should do so. “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light,” Planck said, “but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with the ideas from the beginning.” On February 16, 2013 at 2:00 pm, Colinsberry replied: “As I say: you win some, you lose some.

Was the man qualified as a professional cryptologist or a Verne scholar? Sadly when it comes to the Turin Shroud, most of the time both anti authenticists and ‘shroudies’ have no capacity or even interest in understanding, they only want to air their UNSUBSTANTIAL negative unqualified opinions while authoritatively speaking out of their field of expertise (if any). Reminder: Since 2005, I have been a professional cryptologist (cryptology applied to Archaeology, Criminology and Therapy –in terms of efficiency of transdisciplinary alternative medecines). I also taught French literature, language and civilisation abroad for four years. From 1988 to present, I devoted most part of my leisure time to archaeoperceptive research and studies on the Turin Shroud in light of Late Antique Apocalyptic Christian Literature (esp. The Book of Revelation), Palaeochristian Art, Syriac and Byzantine secret liturgies and Art, Medieval Hagiographic Legends and Iconography, Arthurian Medieval Literature and Iconography, Templar enigmatic graffitis etc). Most obviously, Colin, Hugh and Thibault have eyes, but don’t see, ears but don’t hear, brain but don’t think as far as cryptology, cryptanalysis and cryptography are concerned. When was it, last time, Thilbault et al read L’ILE MYSTERIEUSE (if he/they ever read it !)? Reminder for amateur cryptologists: « In a rush to bring [Jules Verne’s] most popular (and profitable) stories to market, British and American translators repeatedly watered them down and abridged them by chopping out most of the science and the longer descriptive passages (often from 20 to 40% of the original); they committed thousands of basic translating errors, mistakes that an average high school student of French would have managed correctly; they censored Verne’s texts by either removing or diluting references that might be construed as anti British or anti American; and, in several instances, they totally rewrote Verne’s narratives to suit their own tastes (changing the names of the characters, adding new scenes, deleting others, relabeling the chapters, and so on). » —Arthur B. Evans, Jules Verne’s English Translations in SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, XXXII:1 #95 (March 2005): 80. By short instalments, I do hope Dan will allow me to demonstrate in his blog Jules Verne’s L’ILE MYSTERIEUSE is cryptographically Shroud related.

Actually, during early Christian time the cross was made a part of a diachronic ‘shadow play’ between the Old and New Testaments (“Those things which of old the prophet sang in dark figure the new generation of the Maker made clear”) while the Shroud bearing the image of the Messiah was the secret of secrets whence the hard time to fill the TS historical gap. It is also rooted in the intercultural implantation of the Queen of Sheba in conjunction with the wood of the cross of Christ as lignum vitae. For the fanciful and widespread medieval legend of the origins of the wood of the cross has led to a specific tradition of the Queen of Sheba. Actually in the 12th c. CE, the Queen of Sheba was also known as the one who “by gifts secretly signifies the faith of Solomon”, Latin REGINA.SABA. MISTICAT.INDONIS REGINA DIDEM SALEMONIS (see e.g. The Verdun Altar). The sentence in Laitn plays with the word SINDONIS (the Lord’s Sindon). Now in Hebrew, the biblical name Solomon has the same root (Sh LMH) as Salmana, “shelter”, “protective shadow (of the crypt)” and Salmon, “protective Image”, “protective Idol”. “(…) In the legend of the True Cross, the Queen is actually the first person who worships the wood with supernatural knowledge of the crucifixion. )…) In the so called Historia, a manuscript dating before 1150, from Regensburg and kept in Munich, it is told how, in the time of David, a Jew finds a piece of wood with three branches which he brings to the king. By divine inspiration, David recognizes the Messianic function of the wood and has it gilded (alike Christian Black Virgins, comment mine). Solomon also worships it. The Queen of Sheba predicts that one day a man will hang from that particular piece of wood and that this will spell the end of the Jews.” (see The Wood, The Water, and the Foot, or how the Queen of Sheba met up with the True Cross. With emphasis on the Northern European Iconography, in “Mitteilungen für Anthropologie und Religiongeschichte (MARG), 16, Münster , 2004, p. 221, 225 sqq) “One constant is that from the 12th century onward, in the Legend of the True Cross, the Queen of Sheba is privileged with the insight of Christ‟s coming (see מרן אתא: maran ‘athâ’, “The Lord has come”, the two word Aramaic formula used in the Book of Revelation, comment mine), and also acts accordingly. Sheba is privileged with the insight of Christ‟s coming, and also acts accordingly. It is she who recognizes the mystery of the wood of the cross and in all conscience leads the wood to its destination. Against what background has the Queen of Sheba taken over this function within the Legend of the Cross? Which literary clues have led her to the foreground precisely in the 12th century? A primary answer lies couched in the typological interpretations which found access during the 12th century. Isaiah 60.6 says that a flood of camels and dromedaries, as well as gold and incense will cover the citizens of Sheba and that they will “proclaim the praise of the Lord.” This prediction stands in the context of the glory of the New Jerusalem and thus must be understood eschatologically. With regard to a challenge from the Pharisees (“Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you” [Mt. 12.38]), Matthew foretells, “The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and see, something greater than Solomon is here!” (Mt. 12.42; Lk. 11.31).” (ibidem, p. 225) Thilbault have you ever heard about it before passing untimely and discourteous remarks?.","date":"2015-02-23","mins":"3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-191677","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Addendum: last but not least, the same Hebrew word Sh LMH for Sh L Mo H, “Solomon”, pronounced Sh La Ma H means “protection”, “(inner/outer) garment” = Sindon in Greek while the verb Sha Lam means “to accomplish”, “to complete” (see Yeshua’s death and last words, John 19:30) while in Hebrew sheba/sheva (The Queen of Sheba) is “seven” symbol of perfection/accomplishment:completion..","date":"2015-02-23","mins":"4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-191739","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"How long will my February 23, 2015 at 4:45 pm comment be awaiting moderation? “February 23, 2015 at 4:45 pm Reply Your comment is awaiting moderation.

THEN I added up Wiki ESPECALLY FOR YOU given you were in denial and your very low level of knowledge on the Persona issue. How long shall I repeat it? According to several etymologists/Latinists/Etruscanists (Altheims, Baldi, Croon Vernant etc) Persona is derived from the Etruscan word Phersu, a Death G od whose effigy was found in Etruscan tombs (Er ring any bell?). See e.g. Jean Pierre VER Nant (BTW Jules Vernes was born in Nantes ; )), “Mortals and Immortal: collected Essays”, pp. 122 123. The CROIX (Cross) within LA COURONNE DE ROSE “the crown of roses) carved by DOMINI(que) ROZE on Jules Verne’s tomb is quite telling to the initiated eye Jules Verne was R+C = Rosicrucian. Methinks I am just preaching in the wilderness when it comes to YOU who have ears but do not hear, have eyes but do not see. You definitely have not the initiated/appropriate sight hearing and brain coordination system to understand what I mean. Nope. Stop wasting my time, PLEASE. Final note: When Jules Verne coded the onomastic background story of his novel, he was not acquainted with Oswald Szemerényi (1913 1996 CE). Just in case you hadn’t noticed it yet, Jules Verne was born in Nantes in 1828 and died in 1902. Besides the main etymological current is Persona is derived from Phersu (whether you like it or not!). Verne took it as such to implicitly coded Nemo BOTH as Persona, “PERSONNE”, i.e. As MASK and DEATH G OD i.e. Phersu (= Hadès) to embed a secret reference to THE TURIN SHROUD DEATH MASK OF (the Son of) G D when he was in HADES.

However a very close examination of the face in terms of geometrical projection made from a life size photograph tells us ‘a quite different story’: To the sole exception of the bony areas of the eye sockets and nasal septum, all the rest of the face shows irregular features and displacements.” Now on the obverse of more than half a dozen of specimens of Justinian II’s solidi, Christ nose does look skewed, which is consistent with the TS face having been covered with a transparent (silk) veil bearing a Christ face in it too (a more or less marked skewing due both to slight displacement of two clothes + forensic reality as far as the TS man nose image is concerned).

Thus most likely, because a couple of Byzantine artists copied the Holy Shroud/Himation face covered with the Christ transparent face in the Holy Mandylion/Veronica/Veil, the nose looked more skewed and/or broken than swollen. Christ skewed and/or broken nose in Art are exceptions/variants that both tend to prove the canonical iconological rule (Christ with a straight non swollen nose) and confirm the Christ face prototype that was used was a far more complex one than Art Historians and even most if not all Shroud scholars could think at first and second or even third sight..","date":"2013-08-09","mins":"7:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/why-dont-i-see-the-swollen-nose-in-any-of-the-art/","cat":"art","title":"Why don’t I see the swollen nose in any of the art?"},{"id":"comment-40879","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Typo: apotropaic.","date":"2013-08-10","mins":"5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/why-dont-i-see-the-swollen-nose-in-any-of-the-art/","cat":"art","title":"Why don’t I see the swollen nose in any of the art?"},{"id":"comment-40878","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"Addendum: on July 3, 2012 at 12:02 pm | #33 Reply |, I also wrote: “writers (e.g., MARTIALIS Martial) used the Greek word sindon in LATIN as early as the 1st century CE in accounts of very fine linen, silk and sea Byssus veil.

(Latin for “Whom do you seek?”) Easter trope dates from the early medieval period. It was (first?) sung as early as ca. 925 CE at the Benedictine Abbey of Fleury (now Saint Benoit sur Loire) funded ca 630 CE. The Visitatio sepulchri liturgical drama is derived from the The Quem quaeritis? Easter trope. In the Benedictine Hungarian Pray Ms bifolium illustrations (1163 1195 CE), the Visitatio sepulchri section (with the central “a” for Greek Latin anesti, “He [is not here but] is risen”), the Benedictine monk (Joseph Almos?) cryptically “stages” (i.e. Without the image on it) the Constantinople Sindon aka Lirey Shroud aka Turin Shroud that is Yeshua’s burial Sindon as the true relic (not a painted copy dating from 1325 CE± 65!). Moons ago, I wrote: Suffice it to syntactically piece together several corroborating 944 1207 CE testimonies and eyewitness descriptions, from Gregory Referendarius’ (Archdeacon of Hagia Sophia), to Nicholas Mesarites’ (overseer of the treasuries in the Pharos Chapel of the Boucoleon Palace of the emperors) via Robert de Clari’s (Fourth Crusade Picard knight), and a few others, to build a strong if not crucial evidence the Turin Shroud (TS hereafter) and Constantinople Sindon (CS hereafter) could be one and the same object. The literary synthesis reads: “[In the church of My Lady Saint Mary of the Pharos (“lighthouse”) in the Golden Imperial Palace of the Boucoleon in Constantinople and another church called My Lady Saint Mary of Blachernae], Christ ‘rise[d] again’ [then], and the sindon(1) with the burial linens [was] the clear proof. [This sindon] as white as snow from antiquity, [was] of linen, of easily obtainable material, remained uncorrupted and smell[ed] fragrant of myrrh. [It] def[ied] decay because, after the Passion, it [had] wrapped the ELUSIVE(2) dead naked body. [When] raised upright, not only the image of the glorious features of the Saviour’s face with dripping drops of blood shine[d] out but also the form and most noble stature of his entire body hanging down from the cross and embellished with drops of blood and water that make the liquid flow from his own side, could be plainly seen. THIS [WAS] NOT THE ART OF THE PAINTER and the various beautiful colours, which provide a door for the mind to consider the original and depict images [that could possibly have depicted] the reflection of his appearance and size imprinted on [his sindon]. [So much so] the ‘not made by hand’ image of Christ and G od, draped with a white/pure linen cloth he had worn, was sufficiently in lieu of the vision of the Lord coming into the flesh to those who had not corporally seen him. After the city was taken, the French partitioned the relics of the saints and the most sacred of all, the sindon in which our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death and before his resurrection. We know the sacred sindon in Athens. [In this city] we saw with our own eyes the burial linen cloths found in the sepulchre.” This is strong historical evidence indeed and tends to prove the presence of the most famous contact and blood relic of Christianity at Constantinople prior to 1204. As note (2), I also wrote: The Greek word, aperilepton (used to describe the image on the Constantinople Sindon), is consistent both on one hand with G od’s “un circumscribed”, non coercive and loving, divine nature that has NO SHAPES, is BEYOND DESCRIPTION and the binds of Death cannot contain and, on the other hand, Yeshua’s “UN OUTLINED”, EVANESCENT NATURE of his own image on his sindon.
