When studied in the light of the Gospels, the Oral Torah (see tractates Semahot, Sanhedrin, Pessah and Sabbath), the Judean burial customs and practices of the Second Temple period (mostly pre 70 CE Judaism History & Archaeology), archaeoastronomy (to determine the exact burial minimum & maximum time frames for Yeshua’s emergency burial on a Sabbath eve), philology (to take into account Hebrew time markers; Hebrew & Greek action & object markers), ancient textiles, paleopathology and archaeological blood pattern analysis, all points to one naturalistic/ritualistic direction and nothing to the contrary: a “vaporographic mordanting” (of a thin impurity layer) based on (inner )shroud to body gradual loss of direct contact mechanism (as the compressed lengthy shroud got taut again through shrinking). This most likely burial scenario to be tested and controlled via a very specific archaeological experiment implies the following: First, Yeshua’s stiff rigid naked body covered in dried or drying bloody wounds and resting in extra height on two stones in the tomb antechamber, was tautly wrapped lengthwise in a lengthy burial sheet of fine linen (or inner shroud) soaked with an alkaline solution (warm waters mixed with the purifying ashes of the Red Heifer and/or rich in Jerusalem limestone?) and then his legs and torso compressed/fastened widthwise, with fresh antiseptic insect repellent aromatic plants (together with a prayer shawl used as shorter shroud?), in two long strips first cut off/torn off from the main burial sheet and a shorter strip and/or a gauze veil to tie around the head (together with three wooden pieces — cut off/sawed off the titulus crucis? — to be used as a “small jaw box” to make up for a faulty skullcap?). Once his body (still in hyperthermia at 41 42° C?) was thus tightly wrapped up in linen and still resting in extra height, it was subjected to myrrhic aloetic fumigation and left to dry up first on its left and then right side. Finally, his tightly wrapped up body was taken down to the tomb chamber and placed in supine position inside the sole funerary niche on a bed of blended myrrh and aloes to keep it from putrefying and the burial cave entrance sealed by a large stone disc.

His stance does speak volumes! Here is my reply to this layman thinking himself a medieval image expert: Hugh, Your self delusiveness and sheer arrogance as far as Benedictine artist’s (influenced?) image (crypt)analysis is concerned, has you go as far as commenting on your own comment (?????!!!!!): “I’ve no doubt readers will understand that I HAVE INDEED MANAGED (upper cases mine) to “objectively discriminate between co incidental and non co incidental hand gesture,” and demonstrated that by actually looking at the whole context of an illustration anybody can become an ‘iconographic cryptanalyst’ without much fear of contradiction.” ONLY the gullible can take your claim at face value. ONLY a most arrogant Medieval image NON (crypt)analyst cannot fear contradiction. Firstly, you claimed to have managed to “objectively discriminate between co incidental and non co incidental hand gesture”, actually you JUST FAILED TO for lack of using appropriate rigorous reading grids to get refined stats and extract the relevant data/information thereof for you to reach a truly objective picture of the iconographic issue. Actually, your PSEUDO statistical approach and PSEUDO objective demonstration are TOTALLY INVALID is just for the gullible as: a)Your alleged cryptanalysis bears only on “The first 20 illustrations of http://digital.wlb stuttgart.de reproduction contain 17 illustrations”. How do you know the latter are REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WHOLE? b)Your ‘random sample’ of “depictions of 73 people and 6 ‘hands of God’” along with your telling me “The illustrations also show 79 hands, of which 59 have five fingers and are more or less accurately depicted (with one or two very snaky fingers), while 20 have four fingers, the outside two being much longer than the inside two. Of these three or four are pointing, two of them at their own heads”, TOTALLY FAIL TO OBJECTIVELY DISCRIMINATE between: 5 elongated and non elongated fingered hand gestures forming an Epsilon or a 3 with a tail with right then left hand, back then palm of hand view, in vertical, horizontal then oblique position; 4 elongated and non elongated fingered hand gestures forming an Epsilon or a 3 with a tail with left then right hand, back then palm of hand view, in vertical, horizontal then oblique position; 4 elongated and non elongated fingered hand gestures forming an Epsilon or a 3 with a tail AND pointing to Jesus’ figure or head with right then left hand, back then palm of hand view, in vertical, horizontal then oblique position; 4 elongated and non elongated fingered hand gestures forming an Epsilon or a 3 with a tail AND pointing to other figures or heads with right then left hand, back then palm of hand view, in vertical, horizontal then oblique position; etc. Your alleged ‘stats’ ARE TOTALLY MEANINGLESS (and even a total nonsense) and your alleged ‘demonstration’ is NO DEMONSTRATION AT ALL but in your arch sceptic’s dream. Secondly, you also claimed “The hand gestures of the people holding whips CLEARLY (upper cases mine) has nothing whatever to do with the epsilon stain, and, if it is a convention, HAS MORE TO DO WITH the depiction of GUILT (sic!) than any other hidden meaning.” Actually, your PSEUDO interpretation is TOTALLY INVALID too and just for the gullible as: a)It TOTALLY OVERLOOKS THE 5 MAIN CONTEXTUAL LAYERS HERE INVOLVED: 1/intrinsic immediate context (i.e. The miniature itself); 2/extended intrinsic immediate context (the Stuggart Psalter itself); 3/extrinsic immediate context (Carolingian miniature iconography); 4/extrinsic typological context (Flogging/Scourging of Christ iconography); 5/extrinsic extended/overall context (Medieval iconography). B)Your utter ignorance of Benedictine, Carolingian and Medieval iconography has you TOTALLY MISSED ONE CRUCIAL EVIDENCE: this most specific hand gesture is exceptional in the whole Medieval MS corpus yet appears as an intriguing graphic leitmotiv throughout the Stuggart Psalter ONLY. C)Your overlooking the fact the hand gesture can be seen as A SLIGHTLY CRYPTIC VARIANT of an apotropaic hand gesture known as ‘sign of horns’ formed by extending the index and little fingers while vertically/horizontally/obliquely holding the middle and ring fingers down with the thumb visible (palm of hand view) or invisible (back of hand view). Done with the right hand, it can be read as Victory over Evil/Death Sign or Election/Lucky Sign; done with the left hand, it can read as Mockery/Defeat of Good over Evil/Unlucky/Evil Eye Sign; in the Stuggart Psalter when done with the left and/or right it can also be read as Recognition/Identification Sign according to the miniature specific context. D)Your non discrimination between right/left hand gestures forming the tale tell sign of an Epsilon or 3 with a tail; your non discrimination between back and palm of hand views, in vertical, horizontal and oblique positions, have you TOTALLY MISSED THE REAL THING/MEANING of the 4 fingered hand gesture forming an Epsilon or 3 with a tail.

My Goodness, how could somebody totally ignorant of medieval hand gesture symbolism could explain to me anything about medieval hand gesture symbolism? This speaks volumes on your very cheap arrogant unscholarly arch scepticism! You even go as far as writing against the iconographic fact/common sense: “The hand (Judas’) is not pointing to Jesus but himself (Judas)”. You mean pointing to himself via Jesus so? Oh really? The true visual fact is Judas draws the soldiers’ attention with his right hand finger index (this just in case you haven’t noticed it yet!) WHILE pointing at Jesus with his left hand finger index for the soldiers to arrest Jesus, his master (this just in case you would ignore both in the Second Temple period and in Carolingian time, ID photographs were still to be inventented). In other words, Judas is just telling via his kiss and hand signs: “this is the man to arrest”. Judas’ right hand gesture looks natural WHILE the left one looks totally unnatural (= against nature). Whether you like it or not, Judas’ 4 fingered left hand gesture forming a 3 with a tail (that is an inverted left right Epsilon with a tail) points to Jesus forehead, just above eyebrow. At symbolic level, it is both an Identification hand and a Victory over Good hand (implying PERVERSION not guilt at all).

Your claim has no iconographic ground at all. It is nothing else but a figment of your layman’s imagination. Your ‘guilt sign’ and ‘betrayal sign’ are just NON FACTUAL. Reminder: Unless you can provide us with a proof to the contrary, which you JUST CANNOT, to the alleged ‘sole exception’ of the PS MS, such a specific hand gesture never ever appears in conjunction with any Betrayal of Christ scene in medieval iconography. THIS IS AN ICONOGRAPHIC FACT. It is clear you haven’t done much research work and are totally ignorant of medieval iconography. Could you JUST DO your homework, please, before writing your unsubstantiated prose? THE TRUE ICONOGRAPHICAL FACT is the specific hand gesture can read as a CRYPTIC VARIANT of the APOTROPAIC sign of ‘horned hand’ done with a vertical or horizontal RIGHT hand (back hand or palm view) to ward off Evil/Evil Eye/Perversion. Such a sign DOES EXIST and your ignorance of this very fact is just flabbergasting! Actually it dates back to Antiquity. (Re the starting theme of the whole debate namely the CRYPTIC HAND GESTURE forming an Epsilon with tail in conjunction with Christ head to be read as VISUAL PUN on BOTH the ‘horned hand’ and the Shroud face tailed Epsilon like shaped blood mark,) Whether done with the RIGHT or LEFT hand within the context of an execution, the specific hand gesture can symbolize either Fair Retribution/Good Justice from G.od or Kings (see RIGHT hand gesture e.g. In Le Livre des Merveilles by Marco Polo, Ms. Fr. 2810, Bibliothèque nationale de France, miniature of King Chesumur Rendering Good Justice, fol. 19v) or Persecution/Perverted Justice from Men (see LEFT hand gesture e.g., in the Stuggart Psalter, miniatures of both the flogging of Christ and the Second Beating of Christ, Stuggart Psalter fol. [149] 73r). In each miniature the hand gesture symbolizing the Sign of Good Justice (or Victory over Evil/Sin) or on the contrary Perverted Justice (or Victory over Good/Righteousness) is EVIDENT as far as a Medieval Art History or Iconographic Analysis and/or Cryptanalysis is concerned.

However, it led me to investigate the “Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve” which you may not be familiar with, as it also contains instances of the gesture you claim appears in the Stuttgart psalter only.” The true fact is the ROYAL hand of Justice (which, BTW dates back to the middle of the 13th c. CE and NOT to Napoleon????!!!!!!) shall not be mistaken NEITHER with the LEFT Hand of G.od or Hand of Justice/Hand of Rigor NOR with the RIGHT hand of G.od or Hand of Mercy (because you are just totally ignorant of the medieval hand gesture typology, actually you still cannot discriminate between the three symbolic hand gesture). Re the sacramentary of Charles the Bald, the latter contains only one instance (and not instance S as you tried to misleadingly imply) of the symbolic hand gesture of G.od Election/Royal Power bestowed upon an earthly king, which has NOTHING to do with ‘guilt’ or ‘betrayal’ (SEE your nonsensical interpretation of the specific hand gesture). Besides the finger index is NEITHER pointing to any head or forehead (but just to a cloud) NOR the hand gesture forms a VERTICAL 3 with a tail NOR a VERTICAL Epsilon with a tail NOR the hand gesture is/looks UNNATURAL at all seen in conjunction with its owner’s body or compared to the specific hand gesture in the SP scenes of the Betrayal of Judas and the Flogging of Christ… You are just a layman totally lost in medieval hand gesture typology mixing oranges with stones and beavers while ‘thinking’/dreaming you can turn into a medieval image analyst/cryptanlyst overnight or in 15 minutes.

Besides the Holy Face of the Holy Veil and that of the TS are at exactly the same scale 1:1.” (An alleged artistic innovation can actually result from a misinterpretation of the TS face as far as the Christ face iconography is concerned. Absent “the skewed nose” we can also “think we see” when we overlay the Holy Face of the Manoppello Veil on the Holy Face of the TS (a pareidolia that is featured on more than half a dozen justinian II soldii), how else do you account for teeth featured on the Holy Face of the Holy Veil ?). – “Reminder (two): Saints who died in imitation of Christ’s self sacrifice and martyrdom (i.e. In imitatio Christi) could be depicted with Christ like and even at times Shroud like characteristic traits AND/OR (pareidoliac) attributes.” – Reminder (three): “the geometrical fourfold series of blackened rimmed L shaped burn holes could date back as early as 390 CE (see the of Santa Pudenziana with the mosaic of Christ in majesty). Both cryptically and symbolically reminiscent of the blackened rimmed burn holes, we can see a black L (for Lumens Christi) marks standing out on the flashing gold pallium of a Resurrected Christ in Majesty (Santa Pudenziana apse Mosaic, ca. 400, Rome).Now the pallium is the Roman evolved form of the Greek himation that was a very large rectangle of fabric that can be draped as a shawl, a cloak, or a head covering and a current 4,20×1,40m for a 6ft tall man was the correct size; sizes totally congruent with the TS man). Also notice the zigzag weave pattern on the left arm pummel.” (” The L letter identifies the clothing as Pallium Lumeni Christi = Lumen Christi in Sindonem = L in Sindonem = Linus Christi. The official first Pope’s name was Linus as secular representative of Christ on earth that is as his vicarius (Peter was not officially Pope). Lumen Christi (Latin: Light of Christ). See also Lumen verum illuminans omnem hominem (antiphon) and Inventor rutili dux bone luminis (hymn).”) Besides in the apse mosaic, “a 111/112cm width cloth shows stretched as a backdrop just at the back of the throne at Christ shoulder level. Before the 2002 restoration of the Shroud exact width was 111 112cm.The two Christ faces (that of the mosaic and that of the Turin Shroud) are at the same scale 1:1 with congruent spy details: the face of Christ is 4 5cm off centered on the left just like in the Turn Shroud and the position of the feet on the Pudenziana mosaic is also asymmetrical as on the TS.The latter’s body image, seen under a certain angle and light, looks like translucent straw yellow impression. This is consistent with the use of flashing gold mosaic tiles to feature Christ’s pallium.” So what is first ?.","date":"2014-05-16","mins":"1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-120506","author":"max_patrick_hamon","post":"On June 12, 2013 at 2:04 pm I wrote: “Reminder: As far as the Holy Face of the Holy Mandylion and the Holy Face of Holy Himation aka the Turin Shroud connection as relics is concerned, the very word Mandylion is a Byzantine Greek borrowed from the Arabic mandil (mindil in Syriac) i.e. A “SCARF”.
