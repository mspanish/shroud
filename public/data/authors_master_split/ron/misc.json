And I think that statement can sadly be applied to many Shroud researchers these days… I think those people are just blinded by their religious belief and that has an effect in their cases of putting the real quest for truth on the side in order to pursuie their own quest for truth (which is something totally different, as I once said)… When you only seek your own truth, that’s when fanatism is near. I know some people think that I can fall myself into that kind of trap, but if those people could see how many times I’ve changed my mind over the years on many different topics regarding the Shroud, I don’t think they would have that kind of opinion of me no more. I don’t think that defending passionately a rational quest for truth regarding the Shroud (while taking into account ALL the data we know about this object), I don’t think it can be called “fanatism”. I prefer to think it’s more like a defense of the integrity of Shroud research. And, I said it before, I’m not here to make friends but to seek the truth (which, again, is something totally different). I don’t want to fall into one rigid group where all the people should think the same. That’s what I call “fanatism”. Problem is Yannick, although you may believe you are being scientific or ‘rational’, you aren’t. Case in point; over the past many months I have noticed you have ignored, many times, many tangible, factual details that will go against your thinking, you basically shirk the obvious. So if anyone is stuck in their thoughts it is you. Sorry. Another case in point Wilson’s hypothesis; You think everyone including myself accept it completely, unconditionally…not true. It is a hypothesis and accepted as so, nothing more. But it is still, even with all your excessively long blabbing posts, the closest thing we have to possibly the early history of the Shroud, even with some of it’s weaker points. Furthermore, until you or any of these “outside the Shroud world” historians you keep mentioning can come up with a better hypothesis, I’d appreciate if you and others would stop badmouthing Wilson. Even if you dissagree with him, a certain amount of respect should be shown to him considering what he has done to bring the Shroud to the masses. Thanks for listening….I hope.

Calvin most likely was not aware of the Jewish law pertaining to burial cloths and being three times unclean. It would have been a death sentence to anyone whom had possesion of such an article. So not much of a mystery, it being not mentioned in scriptures early writings. Also to the contrary it just may have been mentioned in John 20:11, (A mastery of the secret word?) I mentioned this before about reading the paper “Lazarus and Jesus” by Rev. Dreisbach, it may open some eyes! I side with what it concludes. I’ve come to the notion that the disciples found the Shroud still (bound) in the tomb, which was the direct evidence to them that Jesus had risen, but they were not aware of the image as yet. (It would be pretty difficult to see the faint image in the darkness of the tomb I would think, especially since they would have to unravel it to see the image)… The discovery of the image most likely took place afterward, maybe even when Jesus first appeared to them in the room and he made them aware of it and it’s importance, and also the importance of protecting it. Then it is not too far fetched that an item of such importance would be wisked away to safety and away from prying eyes and hidden.

As they would have been dry for hours.” On this particular topic, I say again to you : Read Barbet’s book again !!! For him, the transfer on the cloth occured because those dried blood clots get humidified again on their surface because of the aqueous environment in which the body was exposed inside the Shroud. I submit to your attention that this aqueous environment hypothesis can be linked to the image formation hypothesis of Rogers ! For Barbet, it is clear, a dead body can emit water vapors and that could have been enough to re humidified the blood clots that were over the scourge wounds, so that a mirror image of those wounds could occured. To this water vapor, I think we can also add the very probable ammoniac gas that could have come out of the body (maybe of every part of the skin, because of a deposit of urea coming from the dried sweat), along other possible amine gas coming from every pores of the skin. All those different gas could have been well enough to create the aqueous environment proposed by Barbet. When you look carefully at the nature of the blood stains on the Shroud (the fact that most of them don’t come from liquid blood and the fact that most of them have a serum halo present around them), I have to say that this is really, by far, the most logical and viable hypothesis (scientifically speaking) that I’ve ever read to explain the presence and the nature of the scourge marks on the Shroud. You didn’t read close enough Yannick, Barbet’s ideas may have a possibility of being correct when dealing with the blood clotted dumbbell areas or larger wounds, but it requires alot of suppositions to reach likelihood, and definately is much more reaching to explain the fine definition of the WELTS. Another thing you missed is that the scourge marks in all probability, would be completely dry, possibly even at the preliminary stages of scabbing, as it would have been many hours that had passed since the scourging approximately 10 hours or more and in open air!.

Ask yourself; How many people were present to accomplish this ritual? And what did the Jewish laws state about ‘Eve of Sabbath’ burials’? Then tell us which is more likely.” I would answer : Most probably, a hasty partial burial because, Ron, you forget one important fact : the burial of Jesus wasn’t prepared at all !!!! First, nobody beside Judas knew that Jesus would be arrested on thurday night and at that time, nobody knew that he would be crucified. And when he was crucified, nobody knew that his body could be buried normally in a normal tomb and not thrown into a common grave with the other victims. When it was clear that the body could be buried in the tomb of Joseph, what time do you think it was ??? Much more than 3 o’clock of the afternoon for sure ! That doesn’t left many time to buy or found a decent shroud and buy or prepared aloes and myrrh (probably in some solid form) to put around the body to avoid bad odors on Sunday morning… And if we take into account the experiments and conclusions of the Spanish team of sindonologists on the Sudarium of Oviedo, they say that it took around 2 hours after death before the body could reach the tomb ! And if we take into account the Gospels, they say that the women did return on Sunday morning to finish the burial. All those clues point in one direction : a hasty partial burial. I don’t see why they would have do anything on Friday except putting the body into the Shroud and putting aloes and myrrh in bags all around the body (maybe inside the shroud) to avoid the bad odors on Sunday morning, and then rolling the great stone to close the entrance of the tomb. Why losing time on other things (like the washing of the body for example) in a context where the Sabbath and the Passover feast were about to start and while they knew all along that, no matter what, they had to come back on Sunday morning ? You didn’t manage to answer one of my questions, at all…nothing!. You just managed to repeat points I intorduced to time interval, as to the Sudarium conclusions!….Answer the specific questions Yannick. Your also a little dillusional if you think there are absolutely no signs of even a ‘partial washing’ my friend. Remember one point; Jesus, from the 140+ wounds he suffered; his body would have been almost completely covered in blood, that means all surfaces….So why only blood be only in some areas and not all surfaces such as the torso or arms legs completely? …If humidity, or sweat, or whatever was the cause?

If Yeshu’a spoke Aramaic (and Hebrew), could you account for ALL the gospels having been written FROM THE START in ‘TRANSLATION’ Greek (i.e. Non natural Greek or word for word hellenised Aramaic or/and Hebrew)?

But what mechanism precisely? And what is the nature of the image in that different mechanism? Why not admit it – you don’t have one, because none of those airy fairy mechanisms that involve something other than direct scorching ever specify the chemical nature of the image, far less the process by which such an image came to be formed without a credible source of radiation, or an imaging system (converging lens etc My theory may be wrong, but it at least specifies the source of energy (thermal), the method of heat transfer (conduction), the chemical nature of the scorch (semi pyrolysed cellulose and/or other carbohydrates). What’s more, it totally rules out any kind of imprinting at a distance. Heat conduction requires that two bodies be directly in contact, i.e. With a zero air gap. Sorry, Gabriel, but you have failed to make any point or objection that advances the SCIENTIFIC debate. If you want to be scientific, then try to falsify the conduction model. But I don’t envy you that task (given that the model can be verified in the kitchen at home, to give an image with “3 D encoded information” using a free downloadable bit of software off the internet). Except for a couple of non relevant and accusational comments made towards those with previous studies of the Shroud, I find Bod’s recent comments seem to have a slight trend to a more serious study of the Shroud, which I may add is refreshing. Now for Bod’s assumption that this image was created by conduction from possibly a metal sculpture; Understanding I am no physics expert by any means but I have plenty of knowledge when it comes to metal working; I think Bod must consider IF a bronze or whatever metal was used; How possibly did they manage “uniform” temperatures across the whole surface of the relief or statue and also manage “uniform” .0002 image depth across both ventral and dorsal images? All metals, except ‘maybe’ very highly refined types will show ‘hot spots’ when heated. To me this FACT alone counts out any type of bas relief method, not to mention the basically impossible notion that someone could place uniform ‘pressure’ throughout the whole surface of the cloth within a finite amount of time to create the image we see. We would need an expert in metallurgy, with unmatched skill in sculpturing, surpassing even the likes Michelangelo and with an unpresedented knowledge in physics and a dexterity only matched by a computer controlled machine to “pull off” such an amazingly realistic image. Not to mention a totally unconventional/unorthodox artistical style to boot!….Bod I also don’t think any person here is expecting any answers from you, as you state.

You make some good points, let me give you a ‘possible’ explanation(s) for some or all of these ‘artifacts’ being present on the Shroud. Following scripture; I, for one do not believe they were in that much of a rush as most conclude, has apparently Jesus died at approximately 3pm, another 2 hours or so passed before they actually took him down and carried him off to the tomb. That would give them probably one or possibly nearly two hours before the moon dropped below the horizon, hense starting the Passover (If I’ve calculated properly). In that time, much can be accomplished! Lets look at it from the view of the persons actually preparing Jesus after they reached the tomb. They, knowing very well that somone would have to come back on the Sunday to complete the annointing/ritual. Time still allowed for possibly a partial wash to be performed (Zugibe), Jesus was then laid in the Shroud, flowers were placed with some spices, as they knew the body would definitely be emitting odours by Sunday and placing such items was done to possibly lesson or restrict the smell. The coins on the eyes were placed to keep the eyes closed and from some recent findings by archeologists, apparently this WAS a Jewish practice of the time, as coins have been found in skulls found in 1st century Jerusalem tombs. They then placed Jesus in the position we see by braking the rig of the arms, then improvised by cutting a strip from the shroud to tie him in position, possibly knowing that by Sunday rigor moris would be waning. All these things may have been done in light that the woman would be back and also done with their frail emotions/conditions in mind. Imagine the woman coming into the tomb on the Sunday to find the tomb wreaking of decay with the body sprawed unceremoniously and the eyes wide open! …What a frightning and horible scene that would be! …I think the ‘preparers’ would have more sense and sensitivity, then to leave things in that manner. Although alot of people do not put much faith in these ‘articles’ existing on the Shroud, we cannot just completely dismiss them also, just because we don’t ‘believe’ they are there. That my friend also is not very open minded or scientific either. Until further, more complete and exhaustive examinations are done on the Shroud with new technologies, I think IMHO, that it would be good to keep an open mind to all possibilities.

Seeing as the blood had adhered to the cloth ‘BEFORE” the image creation??? “Problematic areas”; They are only so if you believe they are.

And as a Shroudie Ron, I don’t understand how you can miss that !!! The Shroud of Turin is a proof that John was there and that he saw everything with his own eyes ! It’s particularly true for the violent scourging (done more violently than usual because Pilate thought that it would calm down the Jewish leaders and prevent Jesus from being crucified) and the lance stab done after death (only report in this gospel). And also, we should not neglect the fact that the author emphasize his testimony by the words : “The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.” (John 19, 35) Now, unless you think he’s a liar, I think this single statement is a proof that the writer of this Gospel (whether it was John the Apostle, John the Presbyter or another person) was there and that he really was a true disciple of Jesus. And if you don’t believe him when he clearly state that he was an eye witness of the Passion, death, entombment, the discovery of the empty tomb (and the empty Shroud !) and the apparitions of the risen Lord, then, I really wonder how can you believe in the resurrection of Jesus !!!!

Also I beg to differ in your idea that science could prove the Shroud inauthentic, there are way to many unknown variables for even science to come to a 100% conclusion, EVER. Oh and I would just like to add, as to your comment above where you mention Roger’s age ranges of 1300 to 3000 years; He questimated this from the lack of vanillin in the Shroud threads; His dating meant the Shroud could be tentively dated anywhere from 1000bce to 700ad depending on the mean temperatures the Shroud had been exposed to over the centuries.

You said one thing one day and then retract from what you say !

When I say “very very unlikely” in combination with “miracle”, I believe it should be taken as; there is NO CHANCE in hell!…So no retracting of my thoughts there….You should probably look in the mirror about the issue you accuse me of. YC; “He NEVER states that the Shroud had been woven during the time of Christ as you seem to point out. Rogers results only give the possibility that effectively the Shroud COULD have been woven during the time of Christ, which is completely different.” Isn’t that exactly what I said? I am not in error with my comment. As Roger’s vanillin dates can place the Shroud’s manufacture in the 1st century! I never said Roger’s stated it was from the 1st century but that, it could be from the first century!…You should try re reading your own previous comment, as it does not make sense and maybe you should read other’s comments a little slower, or maybe twice, as there may be a language barrier issue here. YC; “And in your other comment, you question the possibility (very thin by the way) that I raised that a forger could have created the Shroud between the 5th to beginning of the 8th century while using a real crucified body to do so.” – …The point Yannick was that if a forger used even a dead body, [How the hell did he get the Shroud off the body without disturbing the blood?] This fact, which you are well aware of (the blood not being disturbed) goes against any forgery attempt with a dead body or a statue or bas relief, whatever! You’ve just been found in a contradiction my friend to prior statements. Furthermore to make this “dead body” sceanario even more impossible; How did this forger manage to create the image we see (with a dead body)? But then, manage to do so without any blurring of the image during the process of applying and removing the body using a 14 ft by 3.5ft shroud in the 4th to 8th century? …lets get real here! This is no different then the blood evidence ‘proving’ it was not a painting or work of art, as the blood was on the cloth first…Get my point now? YC; “And concerning the C14 dating, I’m sorry but right now, this method is still considered by the vast majority of the archaeologists on this planet as the best dating method for ancient artefact.” …Now I know there is a language issue here! I never said it wasn’t the best method ‘at present’, (which is arguable), just that it is not infallible, meaning it cannot be taken as a ‘end all’ to any dating issue, especially with the UNKNOWN provenance of the Shroud and the contamination issue. I also believe you are in complete error about what archaeologists ACTUALLY believe when it comes to radiocarbon dating! They more then anyone are aware of the issues with the process and would be the first to back what I’ve stated.

All the other evidence we have, even evidence that is not fully confirmed or evidence some people just will not accept; as in the pollen evidence for instance, which can place this Shroud in Jerusalem, in early spring, and even to a specific time of day, to me anyways, is enough to prove it’s provenance… There is absolutley no ‘confirmed’ evidence that can say; This is not the Shroud that wrapped the historical Jesus in 1st century Judea…Everyone should by now, totally dismiss any radiocarbon testing done to date, which by the way was never evidence ‘on it’s own’, and is the only thing going against this Shroud. Which still dumbfounds me that we still hear about it and it is still mentioned! People should really get their heads out of the sand and do some research on radicarbon dating and the fallacy that it is irrefutable as a testing method!…So in essence there is absolutely nothing against this shroud being authentic, and pages and pages of evidence actually showing it to be so. Lets not forget that for some reason, someone decided this Shroud must be saved and maticulously cared for, for two millenia…Why would anyone care to save a ‘burial cloth’ with such reverence, for so long, if it was of no importance to humanity or simply someone elses?

My working hypothesis is that the Shroud was produced in the 14th century or thereabouts by non supernatural means. So what you may see as “putting down anything and everything you can about the Shroud” is merely an attempt on my part to remain rational and objective about the nature of the imaging process etc, and not be seduced into thinking, for instance, that “encoded 3 D information” is anything mysterious (recalling that the 1532 burn marks also show the same “encoded 3 D information”). Your suggestion that my scorch experiment with the thermo sensitizer and radiant heat (which incidentally I don’t think was employed to produce the Shroud, but still makes a point – that an image can be painted on without leaving brushmarks, indeed leaving nothing except a scorch) needs peer review is redundant. I have shownstep by step photographs showing how it was done which anyone can reproduce in their homes. As for your “schoolboy experiment” dig, you may be interested to know that I predicted the outcome before designing the experiment – based on the scientific premise that a painted on black pigment would selectively absorb heat and light rays to produce scorching of the cloth restricted to the painted area.

So when you make statements such as; “The TRUE fact is your (and others’) interpretation (as opposed to Saint Augustine’s, mine or Meacham’s) is clearly contrary to John 20: 8 LITERAL meaning” It just turns my stomach. How can you be so sure your interpretation is right? or infact FACT? John would have choosen his words very carefully, so for him to use ‘believe’ would have been non climatic, if talking about the woman. So he believed the woman were right in what they assumed? Still makes no sense, as he would have been ‘absolutely sure’ they were telling the truth and not a ‘tall tale’ at that point. So the usage of the word ‘believe’ is contrary to what he absolutely was sure of at that precise moment. Your comments ‘theorizing’ or ‘sole funerary arched bench’ are simply made up also. When Peter entered the tomb he ‘beheld’ (the Orei) what he saw. When John entered the tomb he ‘perceived’ (eiden) what he saw and believed. Meaning, as I intepret it, that Peter was dumbfounded and could not register in his mind what he was seeing, whereas John saw the condition of the linens and the Sudarium and understood (believed) immediately what must have occured, for up to that moment he did not understand that Jesus would rise from the dead and fulfill scriptures. That ‘to me’ is seems like the most propable and logical interpretation. Yes Max, I tend to disagree with your hypothesis when it comes to Jesus’s appearance to Mary at the tomb, as I have an issue with Jesus still wearing a dirty, bloodied 14ft sheet as an himation or article of clothing…I would tend to believe the Shroud was left in the tomb for the apostles to find!

I am quite sure you have experienced this in your life time Max, countless times no less. Moreover; Being we know from scripture the tomb was situated in a garden, she maybe just assumed it was the gardener which approached her, and when he first spoke, it didn’t dawn on her it was the Lord as she would not expect to hear his voice, but when he spoke her name, she recognized him completely as would be expected, since she heard this many, many times before.

But I will answer the question anyway; How are you so “dead sure” the sindon was not in the tomb? Don’t you think John and Peter would have noticed it was NOT there and made mention of it? That would be a clincher that the body had been taken don’t you think? As I can’t see anyone stealing the body without it….thats all I have to say. Also as I said previously we are NOT talking about the ‘other’ times Jesus appeared to the deciples, just this one appearance, so NO I have not stated that in the other appearances everyone was blinded by the Sun….lets please stick to the one topic at hand and don’t put words in my mouth. My statement on the Mary Magdelena appearance, as I stated quite clearly was just an extremely speculative hypothesis in answer to your extremely speculative statements Max. Now to this comment you made to Yannick on his thoughts about the deciples not investigating and just going home; “Had you carefully really read the Gospels, you would have found the answer to your spurrious question: the disciples were instructed by Yeshua (via the women) to meet him in Galilee after the event (‘Go and tel my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me” (28:9 10)…” My response would be; If you had read the Gospels properly Max, you would realize, they left and went home (without any ‘research’ as Yannick stated) before Jesus appeared to Mary and before she went and told the deciples anything!…please get your chronology in order. Now to this comment by you Max; “To the sole exception of Mary of Magdalene who did see Yeshua alive in body and flesh in Joseph’s garden, if you really can read the Greek version of the Gospels and carefully read them you honestly cannot but admit none of the disciples believed Yeshua had resurrected till he appeared to them and opened their minds to what is written in the Scriptures” This may be your and others mis interpretation Max. I interpret the Greek as John at that precise moment of perception ‘believed’ Jesus had risen, not ‘KNEW’. He was not absolutely 100% sure, but believed so, from what he just witnessed, and notice also; he states only ‘he’ believed and not that ‘they’ believed, as in Peter believing so also!… Later that evening he would be ‘sure’ when Jesus appeared to them in the room. Hense the reason he used the term ‘believed’, and the reason he would NOT “Implore the reader to believe” as you say at that time. Ever wonder why none of the deciples had any issue in recognizing Jesus in the room that evening, or the next time when Thomas was present? ….funny isn’t it?

I’m not saying it’s the only way to interpret the tomb scene, but definately your and Saint Augustine’s interpretation surely makes no literal or logical sense. Why intact? Well maybe intact was not the proper word, but basically from his description, it would seem there was nothing missing in the sense of burial clothes or whatever (cept the body ofcourse), else one would think he would have mentioned it. But back to the point; Why would John use the term ‘believed’ if he was thinking about what the woman had told him about the body being gone? It makes no literal sense. It would seem to me it was quite obvious the woman were right and he would have found that out immediately upon entering the tomb. It seems more probable the use of the word believe was to some other ‘notion’. Could it not have dawned on him, at that precise moment, all the things Jesus had said to them in the past and he put it all together that Jesus had risen? I think that is more likely then he believed the woman, especially taking the next line in scripture into account….think about it Max.

But I do have some approx. 2 month old blood (mine) that I spotted onto linen a while ago that is now mellowing nicely (now more brown than red in colour). There is a pronounced series of parallel ribs on the top side of my linen, but unlike the Shroud, my blood has not confined itself to the crowns of those ribs (why should it?) and is instead distributed fairly evenly between ribs and intervening furrows – exactly as one might expect a liquid to do. Everyone is agreed (I think) that the Shroud image is mainly on the most superficial part of the linen, i.e. The crowns, with different explanations being offered (I say it is due to scorching by direct contact; Rogers explained it in terms of impurities that concentrate on the highest points through capillarity and evaporation, where they then react with his volatile body decomposition amines). Why should blood concentrate on the crowns of ribs, given it has particulate red blood cells, and given its tendency to clot quite quickly? Are you thinking what I am thinking? Probably not, but then you are not a sceptical scientist. In fact you said earlier you are glad you were not a scientist (while prepared it seems to believe SOME scientists who say those spots are blood, even though in some cases their comments were hedged around with caveats). I think it highly improbable that a series of dark parallel lines on linen, distinguishable from other image areas only in intensity, represents blood. It is no more blood than those parts of the image that we interpret as “hair”, which also images along the ribs with no sign of any independent strand like appearance. In other words, we “see” hair, we see “blood” at the macroscopic level, but there is nothing at the microscopic level to suggest that real blood, or real hair ever came into contact with the linen. First of all Colin; Did you have the Misses, whip and torture you first? Or maybe if you were suffering from Jondice, before you drew blood? Otherwise, your blood on linen experiment is basically worthless…Thats just to start….Two; I don’t know how you can say the blood is only on the crowns of the threads, it seems and looks to me like much of the blood in the image you linked too above is in the furrows, maybe some on the crowns, but mostly in the furrows. I think it would be expected that over the centuries alot of the blood traces on the crowns could have been lost due to the innumerable times it has been folded, or rolled up and unfurled.

Apparently the threads were twisted or something to that line in 1973…one would suppose maybe from this tape sampling action? I would deduce that since the area ‘may’ have been damaged prior to the 1978 photographs, it is quite possibly the reason no such image can be seen on any photos taken afterward. I seriously cannot remember where I read this,; Would you have any idea about this? As to the photo you have linked us to, I am curious as to what kind of conversation transpired between the two, lol, I’m sure it was quite entertaining. Did you happen to hear it?

Why? because he has a DR. Before his name or a couple of letter afterwards? I don’t know, but it is a total bafflement that all these people will not take the time to do real ‘research’ themselfs.If only they did, they would see how ‘Untruthful’ and ‘mis leading’ most of Dr Karl’s message is.IMO, he is a fraud and a liar (pretending to have actual knowledge on the subject) and I place him in the same catagory as that other guy, whats his name again?, …oh, Mr.Nickells ps. I can’t believe these guys get paid for these lectures either, what a scam.
