Nevertheless, let’s assume the shoulders did not dislocate during the breaking of rigor, still one must consider the position of the abdomen and it’s relation to where the arms and hands will lie if they are brought down.

Hoy se sabe,y la experiencia lo confirma, que cuando la rigidez está establecida el esfuerzo que debe aplicarse es considerable, pudiendo originarse roturas fibrilares, luxaciones o malposiciones articulares, fenómeno repetitivo en las salas de autopsia cuando se vence la rigidez para iniciar la necropsia.

Meaning his back would not be flat, as in a surpine position; The back would have been bent slightly forward, the arms outstretched and slightly to the back. The arms would then have had to been ‘broken’ out of their rigor positioning, this could have or in most probability, WOULD have caused a dislocation of the shoulders, [as attested to by ‘several’ forensic experts]. This dislocation combined with a bent forward posture of the upper abdomen can, in itself, explain the seemingly elongated arms and the fact they can cover the genitalia. This notion of the arms being ‘stretched’ or ‘the hands not possibly being able to cover the genitals’, is a common misconseption, mentioned quite often by those who have done very little research on the matter or lack much common sense.

Rosalie’s explanation may be religiously motivated, but it is a possible explanation and not just from Prof Fanti. Several others have suggested the same including Dr. Jackson et al and others. Although the radiation hypothesis has been disputed by many, including Ray Rogers, it still does not eliminate it as a possible cause.

How is this possible? When it would seem logical from what we view on the Shroud that the man was lying on his back when the image formed, and much more pressure would have been exerted on the dorsal side of he cloth. The maillard hypothesis may ‘seem’ like the most probable ‘natural’ solution to some, but these ‘some’ must also accept it has several important “issues”. …As I stated in a previous post; How can we be so sure that during the retting process, the impurity layer was or would be left only on the top most surfaces of the fibrels and so perfectly distributed over the whole surface, leaving no traces on the inside of the fibrels? How does one explain the amazing detail of the images on areas that in all probability had no contact whatsoever with the cloth and in some areas up to 4cm? Furthermore, I don’t believe we can completely rule out a radiation source. Why? because from understanding ‘exactly’ what the expert Ray Rogers said himself; “It would take very good temperature control specifically to scorch impurities without producing some defects in the cellulose.” …This actually leaves open the “possibility” that it is detainable (i.e possible). Because our scientists, in our present state of technology, do not have the ability to do this, does not make it impossible!. Improbable is exactly how Rogers stated it, he did not say impossible. This can be taken even further, as with all the evidence that has been accumulated over the decades, proving most certainly that this Shroud covered the ‘historical’ Jesus, and he being whom he claimed to be, and also with the testimony of the Gospel writers; Who is to say this “specifically controlled energy” was or is not possible?

Also that many skulls of 1st century Jewish burials have been found with coins in the skull cavity. This would mean it was practiced (maybe not generally), and the coins would have to have been placed on the eyes not the mouth for coins to be in the skull cavity!.

Whether they had to place the items in the Shroud or left them strewn in the tomb is unknown to me. Maybe someone with better knowledge can answer that question. Personally I think it is more logical that these items would have been placed with the deceased directly and not just left lying around. I also would like to say that from the posts above and hearing no rebuttal from Yannick, that no one caught my last post on this topic (More on the freeing of HAL9000). As for the thoughts that the items being placed in the Shroud and them having not enough time is hogwash…The burial tomb was situated in a garden! flowers were easily accessible!…Anyone would have had coins on them, especially a rich man. Scriptures do say he had just purchased the burial cloth. Also how much time would these placements take? Seriously? A few minutes maybe? The reasoning for such items as the coins and flowers being there at all, I mentioned in my last post and the reasoning seems quite logical to me. Sure they may have been rushed but basic things needed to be done. I also see no reason why the coins would need to be removed on the Sunday or the flowers for that matter, and if so, so what? Another thing scriptures were not clear on is how many people actually went to the tomb, I would think several people had gone; so lots of folk helping to prepare the rushed burial seems logical and could explain getting everything done quickly. So you see not so simple or illogical. Yannick your statement that the images seem to be ‘feeling’ instead of reason is completely off the mark. Specialists have seen these images, not thought they have.The coins are a perfect example, they show up in all 3d images of the face! Maybe not clear, but something is definately there. How do you explain the typo error seen/found on the coin image, which was not even known about until the coins were seen on the Shroud? …Anyways I don’t really want to get into it too far either, like you, but think about it, Is it logical or scientific to say all these artifacts are not there just because you don’t see them? …I agree with you that much more study is warranted and maybe the new hd images and more chemical studies will shed some light on this topic in particular. Don’t get me wrong here, I don’t see any of the artifacts when I look at pictures of the Shroud either, but I have seen some ‘things’ in VP image photos, but not conclusively knowing what they are. Some people with direct access and scrutiny of the Shroud, much more then we have ever had, say they have sen these things…So who are we to say they are not there or they are wrong?

Sorry but it’s one or the other! No one can hold both hypotheses together. And because Adler tell us that the blood on the Shroud really show all the characteristics of exudates of blood clots, I don’t know why we should still consider Zugibe’s hypothesis as a plausible explanation for the transfer of the scourge marks. By the way, if Zugibe was right about that, then can you explain to me why there are absolutely no smudges on the cloth, especially in the back region where a high pressure was present because of the weight of the body? Seriously, that just doesn’t sound right at all and, also, such an hypothesis doesn’t even consider Adler’s solid conclusions about the blood. So, I think it’s time to say: goodbye to Zugibe’s hypothesis of a partial washing of the body! All the data and observation coming from the Shroud really seem to indicate that the corpse was rapidly laid down in the cloth and that it was still covered of blood clots and dirt, while there was probably enough time between the death and the entombment for a complete drying of the sweat on the skin and in the hair… These data and observation are TOTALLY CONSISTENT with the Gospel accounts. That’s pretty amazing to note. I have no issue with that. My position has always been that Zugibe is only partially right in his assurtions. I believe the body may have been only partially washed and a clue is the fact there is no dirt on the body, except for a few well known areas; heel of the foot, knees and nose; Where is all the dirt?. Jewish customs did not allow ‘life blood’ to be washed off the body, that is where I believe Zugibe makes his error.

If you only rely on Mark, the beloved disciple is absent from the empty tomb scene… If you rely on John, both Peter and the beloved disciple are present etc. Can you tell me exactly how many buriers were in attendance on Yeshua’s burial, two, three, four, five six or more? How many buriers do you think were needed then? Again pointing to the Edices’ conclusions; we could state quite reasonably ‘atleast’ 3 people were present, as there would have been two persons needed to carry the body, and one tagging along clutching the sudarium to the nose/mouth of the victim’s face. It is very unlikely one could manage the burden of carrying and clutching simultaneously, hense three persons for sure. Most likely Joseph, Nichodemus and John. Whether Mary, the mother of Jesus or Mary Magdalene were present at the tomb is questionable. It would certainly be expected but obviously not stated. One could easily accept they were several people present to help in the burial proceedings. Making it quite plausible a hasty but mostly complete burial ritual was concluded in time.

There was a term, a specific word used; (It escapes me now), but the term could mean the (hands, wrists or lower forearms). So it is not so clear of the exact point of entry. But in saying that I think people have used this “depiction of early art” mistakingly in Shroud science to prove it’s worth. Although the depiction on the Shroud does show an anatomically correct EXIT point of the nail wounds, it does not eliminate the entry in the palms or the depiction of such in early psintings. As it is quite possible the nails were placed into the palms on an angle which would exit where we see so on the Shroud.(Zugibe). The entry of the nails into the palms would have undoubtably been brought down by word of mouth thru the ages as that is what was ‘seen’, as no one could see the backs of the wrists or the wound exits…So the depictions were not in error, quite the opposite they were correct in what was ‘seen’ by onlookers of the crucifixion. That does not take anything away from the undeniable anatomical truth shown on the Shroud of the exit wounds, but only strengthens it’s claim to authenticity. As for the feet, it is in ‘my opinion’ while taking close observation of the feet/ankle/leg ‘angles’ seen on the Shroud and in taking into account the observance that the body is in extreme rigor: The feet could not have been placed flat on the verticle beam of the cross! Therefore it is most likely that a footrest of sorts is evident. This would also make sense in that the victim would have something to push against when raising himself to breath, otherwise the force of such raising would undoubtably be very difficult without!…Again the Shroud details shine in it’s authenticity. Your last paragraph is full of misconceptions; The Shroud most definitely does not go against biblical scriptures accounts when it comes to the what you state; for one the scriptures do not mention a “wound around cloth”, it states a linen was ‘BOUND’ or to bind, not neccessarily wound around. The separate cloth over the face has been delt with many times and is simple to grasp; The head was originally covered by a Sudarium, this Sudarium was removed in the tomb, then the complete body was bound in the Shroud as depicted by the image on the Shroud…You must read up on the Sudarium of Oviedo and read the scriptures more closely as John does state; :”the cloth that HAD BEEN about his head”…As for the washing; it would have been against Jewish custom to wash the body of a ‘victim of violence’ or of a ‘criminal’, as stated in the burial laws of the Jews.

If the image was a scorch it would have to have been ‘extremely’ light scorching. But the back lit photos and decreasing intensity scorches seen on the Shroud, place this in extreme doubt. Even the very slightest of scorch marks on the shroud will block the light. It is hard to believe a scorch could be produced ‘light enough’ to not block any light as one would think each individual fiber would be darkened…Personally I think the back lit photos is definately enough proof the image is NOT a scorch, and only the most sceptic mind would think otherwise.

Your conclusion that the chance of coins being placed on the eyes during the hasty burial is “Very, Very Low” is nonsence. Period. It is an unsubstantiated claim. Time is not an issue, it would take only moments to place coins over the eyes, so that argument is mute. Ancient Jewish customs? Fact; Most all scholars admit they know very little to 1st century Jewish burial customs. Their information comes from 2nd century writings after the fall of the Jewish revolts and the dispersion of the Jewish people. Alot may have been lost or changed due to this. Fact; Placing coins over the eyes was not substantiated as a ‘Pagan’ practice or stricly used by pagan cultures. Fact; Archeaological findings (many), from 1st century tombs prove it was a ‘practice’ to place coins on the eyes, notice I say practice, not a custom. Fact; The Talmud mentions the need to ‘close the eyes’ of the deceased at burial Fact; protrusions are seen on the 3 D renderings of the Shroud over the eyes. Some have seen, after intense study what may be writings and symbols matching that of 1st century coins precisly where these protrusions are found….We here on this Blog have had no chance to study so intensly or closely these findings, so how can we make judgement on them? That is precisely why we should not make statements like the chances are ‘very, very low’, when we have no knowledge to such. To me, the whole issue is still open. From what we understand of Jewish burial customs and the circumstances of that particular day; I think I can say quite logically; The chance of coins being placed over Jesus’s eyes by someone at the tomb burial, is just as likely as it not being done….Pretty simple, and makes just as much sense to me.

Okay lets break this down to your points; 1 ‘The blood marks are not smeared’ Okay so assuming they (Gnostics), used a tortured corpse, how could they possibly pull this off? If they used the corpse to create the image, how did they get the sheet off the corpse without leaving sweared blood or no blood so they may paint them? if they somehow managed this, How did they imprint the blood marks themselfs on the sheet without any signs of brush strokes, blotching, directionality and with invisible to the eye sirum stains etc;~most unlikely and rediculous. 2. “The image is highly detailed, as with a photograph or painting” We know quite conclusively they didn’t have cameras in the first three centuries, so you would assume they ‘painted’ this? Then why a body? Have you ‘ever’ seen a painting with the detail this Shroud image has?, I haven’t and especially with 3 D distance information! Furthermore if they had somehow used the body to create the image, you would have to assume these people had the ‘present’ knowledge of chemical decomposition and the milliard reactions and would have known exactly when to pull the sheet off the body~again most unlikely and rediculous. 3 “The cloth is narrow and long and could serve no other purpose then to create a double image”, I could go on for hours on this statement alone, but lets keep it simple; That is one HUGH assumption. No other burial cloth from that era/local exists to this day, simply because they would have decayed very quickly, only remnants exist. So no clue as to thier size or style. Scriptures say “a burial sheet was purchased”, not sheets, so one may conclude this sheet was quite large. Furthermore if this long narrow sheet was not the proper burial garment, then why would some early century Gnostics use such a sheet to conjure a ‘hoax’? most preposturous. Wouldn’t their contemperaries question this? And why the double image? When a simple frontal image would surfice?….laughable.4. “It assumes the discovery of the empty tomb is an historical event…” Do you have any proof that is wasn’t? Would the disciples make this up, when any contemporary could simply check it out for themselfs? No scholar to my knowledge with any credibility challenges the empty tomb, as all the writers mention it. You say “there are other sources of historical fact that the followers of Jesus swore up and down that he appeared to them after He died” so we are to pick and choose what is fact or fiction? Those same followers also stated the FACT that the tomb was empty~ no word for this ; ) Taking all the comments that have been put forth here by the present bloggers, I think it’s quite safe to say; It is a total illusion to think the Gnostics had anything whatsoever to do with this Shroud, that is my humble opinion.

Let’s contemplate this; From my view although I agree the head wounds remeniscent of a crown of thorns is probably the most striking point towards this person being Jesus, the side wound is also. My thoughts; It is well known that MOST crucifixion victims were left on their crosses to rot, SOME were taken down because the Jewish law not permitting a Jew to hang over night on the Sabbath. Most scholars agree that in most all circumstances victims legs would be broken, no mention EVER of a victim being lanced to hasten death. Before you controedict my statement lets contemplate John 19:31. John makes it a point to mention the two thieves having thier legs broken and Jesus’s not, and ONLY because of the circumstance that Jesus was already dead! John wasn’t very specific about much of the crucifixion but specifically mentioned this very important point. Why? I think it was because he realized afterwards when writing his testiments this was a ‘specific’ point and also because it adhered to scriptures. But maybe as John no doubt had witnessed many crucifixions, realized this particular act was specific to Jesus alone, hense why he was determined to make a ‘specific’ point to it.

At the time John wrote, there was probably already people who said that he didn’t die on the cross and that’s why the disciples saw him alive after ! I think that’s why John emphisize the spear episode : to say that it is certain that Jesus was dead when he was taking down from the cross and that he saw him alive after. And in the context of a Roman crucifixion that couldn’t last long because of the passover and the Sabbath, it is a procedure that must have been done from time to time to make sure that a victim was really dead before taking his body down from the cross. That’s why I say the spear wound is not an absolute proof that it is Jesus depicted on the Shroud. We cannot be certain that other criminal who died faster than normal on the cross didn’t received also this treatment before being taking down from the cross… But I agree with you that it must have been a pretty rare procedure because criminals didn’t died fast in a normal Roman crucifixion. Your reasoning for John’s mentioning of the lancing makes no sense! Your forgetting John ‘specifically’ mentions the others were clubed (crurifragium), breaking the legs. Why would John bother mentioning the clubing of the two thiefs at all then, if his only goal was to state clearly he witnessed Jesus’s death? Furthermore, John would not by any means have to prove to his contemporaries that Jesus was actually dead before taken from the cross. People then would know ‘quite well’ that the Roman soldiers and particularly the Centurian in charge, would make no mistake of it. As it would be a serious dereliction of duty, an offense punishable by death. These Roman crucifixion ‘teams’ were professionals and very experienced in their trade. So for the soldiers to allow Jesus to be taken down from the cross, everyone would be absolutely sure he had passed on, no question. Therefore I think it makes more sense these details were written because John realized, afterward, that that specific lancing did in fact allow Jesus’s death to accomplish prophesy (no bones would be broken), and that in fact it was a rarity among crucifixions….And possibly because this ‘rare’ wound was one highly noticeable blood stain seen on the Shroud. (assuming ofcourse John would have full knowledge of the Shroud and it’s imprints), which is highly likely since he found it in the tomb.

It was a year they would wait before retrieving the bones and obviously most remnants of any shroud or material would be gone by then. The fact that we have a burial shroud also goes as evidence to the empty tomb, whereas if someone had ‘stolen’ the body and disposed of it or buried it, wouldn’t they have kept it wrapped in the Shroud? Why seperate the Shroud from the body in this case? Especially considering it would be covered in blood. This was a big no no occording to Jewish law in that no unclean thing must be touched. Whomever retrieved and kept the Shroud was taking a huge chance of getting caught and being punished by death, this goes for the Sudarium also..","date":"2011-12-07","mins":"6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/07/why-do-we-think-it-is-an-image-of-jesus-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think it is an image of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-5309","author":"ron","post":"First, nice to see you on here again Maria : ) “Why should the image be of Jesus and not someone else?”… I’ve heard this question asked many times. Alot of Shroud opponents will try this logic to sway people often…Too me personally, the first time I saw the image I had an overwhelming feeling or dare I say an “Instant recognition” that this was our Lord Jesus. The image was so imazing, so real and even with my very limited knowledge at the time of the Shroud, I knew in my heart it could not be man made. Why not someone else? Logically, I think it comes down to probabilities. Probabilities such as; Why would anyone save a burial shroud?, as it was against Jewish law to do so. Why does it still exist and been faithfully preserved and venerated for two millenia? How many people in history suffered the exact same afflictions as the man on the Shroud?, and as depicted in scriptures occurred to Jesus during his crucifixion! There is a great video on the website; Shroudtv.com and under the heading ‘Identity’, where you have Prof Bruno Barberis explaining ‘Calculus of probability’ and how it scientifically provides strong evidence that the man on the Shroud can logically and thru the use of mathematics only be one man and that man is the historical Jesus.

I’m confused….Anyways, I doubt we will ever find a shroud that had covered a crucifixion victim and which was removed within the alloted time. So in essence your idea that if one was found it would have some kind of image is pure speculation. The question one should be asking here is ; If this is an authentic burial shroud, Why was it removed? and was it just plain chance that it was removed at precisely the right moment so that putrefaction did not destroy any evidence?

I think that’s what Marcel Alonso meant by comparing the Shroud with a flower. This and also the fact that, like a flower, even though the image on the Shroud is not reproducible, that surely don’t mean it necessarily come from the Resurrection of Christ directly (or indirectly as a by product). I agree with Alonso’s point of view. Yannick I really don’t think anyone here has ever stated that because the image cannot be reproduced, as of yet, that it must then be from a resurrection event. But if you take all the evidence gathered to this point, into consideration, I think it may be quite difficult to argue against it actually being so. The whole point against the 100 shroud hypothesis is that it would be very very unlikely that a burial shroud would ever be removed from a victim, especially in 1st century Judea. I agree with you that the chances the Shroud is a fake is practically zero. I also agree that we can not say for sure that it was not some natural chemical occurance that caused the image, but when one gathers all the evidence and coincidences to scripture together, one finds it hard to go against a miraculous event. That is my belief anyways. Sorry, I don’t have time today but I will certainly read your comment when I get the chance.
