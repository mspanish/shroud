If anyone has not done so, I’d highly suggest they purchase the book linked to above, written by J. Bennett: “Sacred Blood, Sacred Image” it is an excellent read and covers all that is known of the Sudarium of Oviedo. As for the blood match; I personally have no doubt about it, but Kelly makes an excellent point about the DNA, in finally put this issue too bed…I doubt there would be a problem getting DNA from the Sudarium, from what I’ve read there is still blood scabs clinging to the cloth! The Shroud I think would be a different matter. I’d also like to mention I look forward in anticipation, to reading Kelly Kearse’s paper which should be posted this month on shroud.com R.","date":"2012-08-03","mins":"8:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/02/how-good-is-the-match-up-between-the-sudarium-and-the-shroud/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"How good is the match up between the Sudarium and the Shroud?"},{"id":"comment-150365","author":"ron","post":"Confusion about the Sudarium….How and Why? … The skeptics obviously have not taken the time to study deeply into the subject. Why would they assume the Sudarium would still be over the face during burial and /or covered by the Shroud? ..There’s no evidence for this anywhere, not in scriptures, not in the Talmud, no where!….so why is it even assumed? Scriptures state it was in a place by itself, away from the burial cloths, not with the burial cloths. On the other hand, if one was to study fully the Sudarium of Oviedo, which claims with good reason to be the ‘face cloth’ folded in a place by itself, and there is much evidence that suggests it to be just that. With study, one would find the very intense studies done to date on the Sudarium of Oviedo would suggest it was placed on the head whilst Jesus was still on the cross and removed before the final burial/ wrapping occurred..","date":"2014-09-12","mins":"12:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/11/article-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"article","title":"Article on the Sudarium of Oviedo"},{"id":"comment-14602","author":"ron","post":"Big +1 to Max’s references! One must also keep this very important point in mind; Radiocarbon Dating results ON THEIR OWN are irrelevant…(All evidence must be weighed in the course of study, with no exception!) Ofcourse one also should educate themselfs on the shortcomings of C14 dating; Especially with textiles, and most especially with Linen/Flax materials themselves. Time and time again C14 results of linen have shown extremely difficult to sample. Countless examples of erroneous dating has occurred and much is still not understood as to why.

As he does not understand the simple fact that not only from scripture (John 20:7), but from details observed from the study of the Sudarium and also evidenced on the Shroud, that the Sudarium and the Shroud did not compete for image quality. As the Sudarium was removed before the the Shroud wrapped the body and before the image mechanism occurred. This point was made by Stephen Jones on his blog, I just thought it needed mentioning here. As for his statement that there is “no correspondence whatsoever”, I think colin should atleast read one book on the subject of the Sudarium before making such rediculous comments. There is not just a simple “correspondence” of blood image shapes;( 70 points of congruence front and back to be exact), but also the stains are of very close dimensions, slightly larger stains are found on the Sudarium, as would be expected. The stains show the nose length being identical, as well as the beard stain on the Sudarium when compared to the Shroud. I can go on and on here, but that should be sufficient in my argument… R R.","date":"2012-08-06","mins":"6:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/02/how-good-is-the-match-up-between-the-sudarium-and-the-shroud/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"How good is the match up between the Sudarium and the Shroud?"},{"id":"comment-195550","author":"ron","post":"Hi Matt, yes the Sudarium has been tested for pollen and the findings apparently coincide exactly with where the Sudarium had purportedly travelled along the Northern edges of Africa from Israel into Spain..","date":"2015-04-07","mins":"1:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/06/new-paper-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"sudarium","title":"New Paper on the Sudarium of Oviedo"},{"id":"comment-215957","author":"ron","post":"I’ll just add a little tidbit here about carbon dating porous materials; It is pretty well established, I believe, from my readings that linens, clothes etc. Are prone to contamination and unless they have been left undisturbed such as a mummies wrappings, contamination would be a very big issue and especially with flax. Seeing how both the Shroud and Sudarium have been handled and transported many times over the centuries, I would conclude carbon dating would be next to a useless endeavour. As for the mention of carbon dating seeming to bring up the 7th & 13th centuries and how there may be a plausible answer to this;…I read an article recently where ancient trees in Japan had shown, through the study of their rings, a massive increase/burst in Carbon 14 amounts in the atmosphere dating to the 7th century.
