I have no issue with Barrie and when I stated; “a point was made”, I definately was not in line with Colin’s comments (although it seemed like it from a terribly written comment). I was just actually making a suggestion, where I believe many of us amateur researchers do not need the actual photos, as in downloading them, but would like to view them and hopefully with better clarity or (dpi). This is quite possible, as I’ve come across it many times on other sites, as photos can be accessed online, on the site, but without the ability to download said photos. If others would like to actually have the photos for personal use then yes they can email Barrie and ask. I just didn’t understand why this has not been made available! But after reading Barrie’s comment, I see now that there are issues, as in time and funds to name a few. I just hope Barrie will reconsider his stand of not making available any photos over the present dpi, in light of the proposal of making all photos available {for viewing only} without ability too download….In due time ofcourse…If I lived nearby, I would easily volunteer myself to help in the process, believe me. But it’s Barrie’s site, he can do with it what he likes, I’ll make no mention of it again.

Not content with misusing the tools of science over decades, Shroudology and its camp followers are now attacking science and scientists for having come up with the wrong answer on the C dating. “By you accepting the 1988 C 14 dating, as the means to end all question of the age of the Shroud, shows a complete lack of logic, scientific objectivity, honesty and dare I say bias.” That is actually defamatory – character assassination in fact. I’m glad I set up the new site, to tell the world what happens to any scientist who attempts to tell it the way it is. Small wonder we have a virtually unchallenged edifice of pseudo science from all those numerous Shroud symposia, aka “let’s make it up as we go along”. You have provided an example of what I an minded to call “the New Dark Age of Unreason”, one in which the tools of science are first misapplied, and which then become weaponised and turned on any real scientist who has the temerity to protest. I am course recording all this for posterity on my own site… Go ahead Bod, post it and then maybe people will see just how illogical you really are being. The point I am making seems to be lost here by everyone and that being; that archaeologists DO NOT regard 14 C dates as being “ABSOLUTE” because of frequent anomalies (Most 14 C technicians will admit this also). They (archaeologists), rely more on dating methods that link into historical records. So basically for anyone involved to accept a single 14 C dating as the ‘final answer” is rediculous, it is just not so!…simple. There are far too many issues with 14 C dating to be so conclusive, especially if much in the line of radiocarbon dating is assumed. Get my point? No one being “Objective”, especially the scientists involved can say with a clear conscience the 1988 14 C dating is conclusive in any way. This is just simple logic I’m talking here. But you know this already, right Bod? I’m not saying anything against the truth here. So why all the opposition to the truth on radiocarbon dating?

Daveb also has a point in that either scenario may be tenable when it comes to the tomb narrative. Translation of the scriptures is a sticky point when dealing in such matters. I tend to disagree with Augustine’s interpretation and feel it tends to run along the lines that the apostles or in this case in particular, John, were idiots. To me, John at that precise moment, after viewing the status of the burial cloths knew exactly what had occured and as Jesus had told them he would rise again on the third day. The other apostles still hiding were not prevy to this knowledge and possibly didn’t believe John either when he got back and told them. It is quite reasonable to assert that when Jesus appeared to the disciples in the room that evening, John was already fully aware and a believer of Jesus’s resurrection, yet not the others. I have an issue with Davebs’ assertion, in the possiblility of the image being ‘noticed’ in the tomb on that Easter morning, as the image would have been on the inside of the Shroud (if the Shroud was left exactly as before), and not noticeable at that particular time. Not until the the Shroud had been retrieved and spread open in proper light, would the image have been noticable.

You look at it with your eyes of modern faithful who had time to assimilate the concept of the Resurrection of Christ… On Easter morning, when the tomb (and the Shroud) was found empty, I’m not sure that there was even one disciple to believe in Jesus Resurrection before he appeared to them and they could see him alive again (even though what they saw was surely a bit different than the image of the dead Jesus we can see on the Shroud, since they had trouble to recognize him). But in the end, who knows? Maybe John was much more clairvoyant than the rest of the group… It is possible but, in the face of the rest of the Gospel stories related to Jesus Resurrection, I have a serious doubt about that. Surely, Thomas was not the only one who needed to see in order to believe… This is part of human nature I guess. I think careful reading of the scriptures is warranted and that YOUR commonsense is waining.,The Apostles had no problem whatsoever ‘recognizing’ Jesus in the room that evening, no mention of such or during the other visit with doubting Thomas and many others. It is also not a case of ‘clairvoyance’ in John’s believing, but is a simple case of DEDUCTION, Yannick…you know what deduction is right?

My point in opposition was only in not understanding why a you believe a ‘supernatural phenomena’ explanation would be needed to explain away the erroneous 1988 carbon dating?

Basically there were so many errors made back then during the testing, one being people took the results as concrete. In saying that, I feel, it was a shame the dating was accepted by the scientific community in particular, and should have been challenged immediately by them.

Q; Why must the image be complete anyways? We cannot presume to know what God would do or Not or how…so I think this attribute is irrelevant, except for our wanting to understand the image formation mechanism. Sure maybe our science of today is not advanced enough to understand the Shroud and many further tests are required, but I honestly believe even with complete direct access to the Shroud, the experts would still be at a loss to exlplain it, as one member of STURP stated “science cannot reproduce the resurrection in a lab” So maybe science will never solve the issue!.Which is my point. But ‘as it stands today’, science is baffled by this image, that alone speaks volumes. I agree with you that the blood is a big ‘clue’ to solving the mystery, but the image itself and it’s formation is the ‘Holy Grail’ here. The Jospine image is old news to me and from my readings on the subject it is fully undertstood that it does not carry some of the most intriguing attributes of the Shroud image. Mysterious yes, freak of nature, yes…but not in the same category as the Shroud image. So as it stands, also through my extensive readings over the past 2 decades and of my personal observations although limited, I truly believe the image is directly related, i.e; caused by the resurrection or a by product of such…To me the onus is on science to disprove this and until they do, (and again I’ll state, I don’t believe they ever will) I will hold on to my ideas.

It has been on my mind for much time…First I must add that I can only make assertions here from what material we have available, so my observations are based on images available to me. I’ll attempt to address my assertions in point form to make it shorter and also make it easier to debate… From my observations; 1. I notice a difference in “luminence” and ‘density’ between the posterior markings (P Ms) and ‘any’ burn markings. The P Ms seem more reminiscent of some blood stains that seem to have ‘settled’ at the end of a blood stream. 2. The P Ms do not seem symetrical, not from a centered point of the Shroud itself or of the centering point of either the poker hole burns or the larger burn markings. Also the angles are quite different! This leads me to believe these P Ms are not related to either incident and are ‘independent’ of both. 3. Observations from point 2 bring me too conclude the P Ss were most likely not created whilst the Shroud was in a folded configuration…Due primarily to the angle of the formation….Note; I have seen any photos of what Max as suggested here. 4. It seems improbable that the ‘liquid’ stains surrounding the P Ms are a “dousing” as they are too exact. (Unless someone had a syringe style douser and centered it exactly to the stains)…This is especially evident from the top two stains (left & right). These are precise circular stains bearing from the center and also of a deeper colour then most all water stains.

I just wanted to set the record straight about that.” Try reading a little closer in the future…. Bennett pg74, pt6; “On the lower part of the left edge of the cloth are a series of stains which correspond to puncture wounds, produced while the man was still alive and [which shed blood approximately one hour before the linen was placed on them].” …para mine. From the paper; Comparative Study of the So O and the S Hroud of Turin, III International Congress, June 1998; Mareno, Villilian. Pt7; “At the bottom of the back of the head, there is a series of wounds produced in life by some sharp objects. These wounds HAD BLED an HOUR before the cloth was placed on top of them.” This clearly means liveblood stopped flowing approximately one hour before the Sudarium was placed on the head…As any blood flow would stop flowing with the advent of death and the heart pumping…simple deduction and reasoning.

I haven’t read Guscin’s book myself, so I cannot make any comments to it…As for the C14 tests you mention, none of these were reliable! Mario Maroni had sent two labs (Tuscon, Toronto) samples he acquirred, which Max Frei had taken, in 1979. These tests were performed in 1994, …thats 15 years later! The condtions in which the samples were stored was not known, the tests were done without authorization or tracking. Plus there was a myriad of issues pertaining to ALL the C14 tests done, too long to list here…It is pretty clear none of the C14 tests done are of any ‘serious scientific value’…Incidently, Dr. Jull, when questioned by Guscin pertaining to the testing, made a very enticing statement; “in order to produce a radiocarbon date on any paticular material, it is important that the origin of the samples be known and clearly stated to the laboratory.” ….Origin?, …provenance…Ring a BELL? The C14 tests done on the Sudarium are completely irrelevant, period. Moving along to your question on Bilirubin, Mr Jones can only repeat what he would read from Guscin’s or Bennett’s writings, because as far as I know he has no access to the EDICES papers and cannot read Spanish, so don’t expect any new announcements. ; ) Miss Bennett on the other hand can translate Spanish quite well, but did state in her book that much of the EDICES reports were of a very ‘technical’ nature and she would keep her writings to a more understandable level for her readers. I have a question for you on the whole Bilirubin thingy; Are you a medical expert? It would seem to me that you are assuming the postmordem 1part blood, 6 parts serum liquid found on the cloth would contain bilirubin? Would it?…We need an expert here to answer that question as I am no expert and definately am not so sure about it. We also cannot know whether bilirubin is mentioned or not in the EDICES studies, or if they had studied all blood samples found on the Sudarium.

Then from the frontal stains again, but these ones flowing up the nose to the forehead, it was deduced that the body lay partially face down with the head resting against a solid object for approx another 45 minutes to an hour… The Sudarium was then rewrapped fully around the head and the body was moved, where finally five to ten minutes later the Sudarium was completely removed from the body…I don’t see how that can be so difficult to comprehend. If you add the one hour before the cloth was placed over the head, then another hour on the cross and then another approx one hour to possibly one and a quarter hours laying in front of the cross and moving the body to the tomb, that puts us at approximately 6 to 6:15 in the evening. Seems to work out pretty good!

I’ve made a long reflection about the blood and here’s my hypothesis about why there’s not more blood traces in the head and face region on the Shroud (while we know that any injury to the head region can easily cause an important bleeding – just like the description you did) : If we take notice of the study that was done about the Sudarium of Oviedo (http://www.shroud.com/heraseng.pdf), here’s the time estimation made by the authors (one of them was a pathologist by the way) : Jesus stayed about one hour on the cross after death. Then, he was dropped down from the cross and stayed on the ground another hour or so. Then, the body was moved to the tomb and this displacement took about 10 minutes. So, we have a total of about 2 hours and 10 minutes (maybe plus or minus 30 minutes) between the death of Jesus and the moment his body was laid in the Shroud. It’s well enough time for many of the blood clots that were still humid at the moment of his death to dried out completely and, because of that, those dried blood clot were not able to leave any imprint on the cloth. Only a small portion of the blood was able to stay enough humid during all this time to stained the cloth by the process called “decals of humid blood clots”. And for the face, notice how few blood stains are present there. I think there’s a good probability that the face was rapidly clean up with another cloth (by respect for the dead). If a rapid clean up of the face was really done, then I have to think the hypothesis of Lavoie who pretend the blood that we see in the hair region on both sides of the face was originaly directly on the face… But if the clean up was done just to remove the blood and fluid that was mainly present in the beard and mustache (and was not done on the cheeks), then, maybe Lavoie hypothesis is correct after all. This hypothesis of Lavoie is not easy to analyzed… What do you think of this hypothesis Ron ? But, for the blood present in the face and head region, if there’s not more decals present, I really think it is mainly due to the fact that the body was put in the Shroud only a long time after death, so that many blood clots that were humid at the time of death were not able to stay humid all this time and dried out completely. Only a small portion was able to stay humid enough to stain the cloth. This hypothesis is in total agreement with both the study done on the Sudarium of Oviedo and the gospel accounts for a burial that wasn’t prepared at all and wasn’t even expected. Well I have contemplated alot of these things myself. I have read much on the Sudarium and I believe they concluded the sudarium was placed over the head/face of Christ after death, while still on the cross and approx an hour later he was removed. Seeing as scriptures mention a storm brewed up (and picturing high winds) I see no reason to refute that most all blood, sweat or any body fluids would have been almost completely dry by the time they even took him down from the cross! Let alone another hour passing before he is even placed in the Shroud. But then there is the question of dirt being blown around and covering the body, as it was still damp. Plus if we acept the times concluded with the sudarium, he was then laying in front of the cross (face down apparently) for another hour…So what happened to all the dirt??? This is one of the reasons I tend to appreciate Zugibe’s hypothesis that the body was ‘partially’ washed during the burial….it would explain alot, but raises questions of it’s own. Lavoie’s hypothesis makes sense if you accept the concept that the Shroud fell thru the body. As there would be no other explanation for the blood decals to have shifted.

It’s not any different then alot of unpublished information out there.

Do you know for sure the blood is not degraded or that the EDICES actually looked for bilirubin?

But only after death, from what I understood. Also according to these studies the sudarium was completetly removed from the head approx 2.5 hours later.

Frei’s samples were taken from the Shroud in 1978, the reason he found more pollen is basically due to his method of retrieving them from the Shroud, he basically used tape and not with a pressure sensitive tool as everyone else, meaning he got deeper/further into the threads of the linen, no mystery there. Just as Scafersman can question Rogers peer reviewed paper I and many others can question how possibly the Nature paper got thru the peer review without being scrapped. You may want to read Remi Van Haelst’s paper; Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin; The Nature report. This may open your eyes to some serious issues with the Nature paper itself and the tests done by all labs and their unfounded conclusions. Remember another thing here; your schaferman has never studied anything to do with the Shroud, he’s never had access to anything, yet from a distance can refute people with probably far more knowledge and experience then he in their respective fields. Rogers was a professional, highly qualified and honoured in his field of study. Shame on schaferman and you to belittle/accuse a man of such standing, especially when he cannot respond. Your completely wrong about the pollen also, you got it backwards, it was NOT insect born pollens in many of the cases. Maybe you should read Denin’s book also.

Wilson has covered the reasoning for this in his books quite well and is easily understandable. If one understands when these Mandylion paintings were created, the artists did not have the pleasure of seeing the Shroud image in the ‘positive’ as we do today. They did not in most probability get to see the Shroud image face in bright light or natural sunlight. It is more likely they were viewing the Shroud in the semi darkness of a candle lit cathedral. When the Shroud face is viewed without any aids it is quite reasonable to mistake the eyes as being opened>IF one can forget the negative we are accustomed too and realize the actual ‘faintness’ of the Shroud when viewed in real life. So Wilson’s assumption is quite reasonable and most likely the truth of the matter. Furthermore some here must also realize the blood, if viewed in ‘real life viewing’ is basically indistinguishable from the body image. One must also accept if the Shroud was folded in eight and partially covered, these artists would have no conception of it being a burial cloth. All these points very reasonably explain the ‘open to closed eye’ interpretations found in artistic renditions. As for the C14 fiasco, it was a nooby mistake by de Wesselow to not back his statements with links to evidencial documents but maybe he expects the reader will reasearch on thier own! If one does research the c14 fiasco and there are many many papers to study. One would question much about the whole process which occurred and one of these processes was the ‘breaking of evidence’ when the Shroud sample cut from the Shroud was taken to a different room (out of site from the camera) and anyone else. This IS highly suspicious! and against protocol. There are dozens of other issues just as important and suspicious as this, if one is to ‘RESEARCH’ in depth.
