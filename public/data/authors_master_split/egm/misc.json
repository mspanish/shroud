[{"id":"comment-36678","author":"egm","post":"“If anything, being honest and not denying science (e.g. By quoting scripture or an apologetic argument) elevates science.” Interesting how simply quoting scripture is now equated with denying science. Sounds very Dawkins inspired kind of thinking. Shall we just edit out the reality that nearly all the founders of the modern fields of science (later hijacked by the World Socialists/Atheists political front) were inspired by those very scriptures that now ‘believers’ in this woeful age seem to be embarrassed of in a scientific discussion? Scripture is deceptively simple on the surface yet so far over the tiny mind of the typical modern thinker that it takes the brilliant gift of a Newton or Planck to perceive and dedicate themselves to exploiting its other worldly, timeless, divine treasures over against mass marketed worldly conventional wisdom that would divorce scripture from science and vice versa. “There are more sure proofs of authenticity in the Bible than in any secular history. *All my discoveries have been made in answer to prayer.* I can take my telescope and look millions of miles into space; but I can go away to my room and in prayer get nearer to God and Heaven than I can when assisted by all the telescopes of Earth!” Isaac Newton.","date":"2013-06-11","mins":"4:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/10/pounding-the-square-peg-into-the-round-hole/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Pounding the square peg into the round hole"}]
