[{"id":"comment-122355","author":"egm","post":"My very first two posts on this blog touched on the subject of canonization of the NT in apostolic times by the apostles themselves and hinted at the problem of the translation of phelonen (https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/21/another review of thomas de wesselows the sign/#comments). As the late Ernest L. Martin showed in the volume I referenced in that thread, the canonization process was started by Peter and Paul as various clues reveal in the NT itself, including a big one when the word in question is rightly understood in context in 2 Tim 4.13. Even the Catholic Church’s highest saint, Augustine of Hippo, who was instrumental in canonizing the NT as accepted in the Catholic church understood the NT canon to have existed in the time of the apostles: “Distinguished from the books of later authors is the excellence of the canonical authority of the Old and New Testaments; which, having been established in the time of the apostles, hath through the succession of overseers and propagators of churches been set as it were in a lofty tribunal, demanding the obedience of every faithful and pious understanding.” Contra Faustum Man The original Aramaic NT in the Peshitta has the word for “bookcase” not cloak. This is important to consider because it provides a clue Paul was in the process of collecting texts for a new canon and needed the materials he requested to do so. Here are some relevant paragraphs from Martin’s book that summarize this issue: *** The Cloak, the Scrolls, and the Parchments Timothy and John Mark were asked by Paul to fetch three important items and bring them to Rome. “When you come, bring the cloak [Greek: phelonen] I left with Carpus, and the scrolls, especially the parchments” (2 Timothy 4:13). It is interesting that the phelonen, usually considered to be a heavy outer garment, would be mentioned alongside the paper scrolls (actually scrolls made from the papyrus plant) and the parchments (these were animal skins on which permanent documents were normally written). It seems odd that a heavy coat would be in the same context with literary documents. Most scholars, however, point out that Paul wanted Timothy and Mark to hurry to Rome before winter (verse 21) and that he probably wanted the phelonen which he left with Carpus in order to keep himself warm when the cold would set in. This may be the case, but there are some difficulties with this interpretation. The truth is, the word phelonen had another meaning in the Greek world at the time, one that was intimately connected with scrolls and parchments. Vincent, in his Word Studies in the New Testament, has this to say about the word phelonen. “Hesychius explains it as originally a case for keeping the mouthpieces of wind instruments; thence, generally, a box. Phrynicus, a Greek sophist of the second half of the third century, defines it as `a receptacle for books, clothes, silver, or anything else.’ Phelonen was a wrapper of parchments, and was translated figuratively in Latin by toga or paenula `a cloak,’ sometimes of leather; also the wrapping which a shopkeeper put round fish or olives; also the parchment cover for papyrus rolls. Accordingly it is claimed that Timothy in 4:13 is bidden to bring, not a cloak, but a roll case. So the Syriac Version.” 1 The fact is, the word phelonen can mean either a cloak (and it is commonly used that way in Greek literature) or it could mean a receptacle for the placement of scrolls and parchments. It is the context which must determine what the apostle Paul meant by the use of phelonen in 2 Timothy 4:13. Since the word is found right next to scrolls and parchments, the immediate context would suggest a “book cover,” a “book case,” or “book slip” into which scrolls or pages of books were placed. As Vincent stated, the Syriac Version of the New Testament understood it in that manner. Chrysostom, in the 4th century, commented on this very reference of Paul’s and stated that some thought Paul meant a “book case” — a receptacle for books. 2 Even Jerome mentioned this point. 3 http://www.askelm.com/restoring/res031.htm Peter talks of leaving behind the testimonies for people to recall them when they needed to, and how was that done? By leaving a written record. In short, it was the apostles themselves who saw the need for a New Testament canon of scriptures and it was they who produced it. When the 1st century Christians finally came to the realization that Christ was not returning to earth in their generation, they began to write accounts of Christ’s life and documents about his teachings for posterity, and they were doing it in the manner they thought best. Luke referred to this and said that “many” were composing such Gospels (Luke 1:1). While this might appear a good thing at first sight, it must be remembered that these written Gospels were being produced within an environment of religious and political insurrection. How could one be certain the various accounts were presenting an accurate narration? It is because of this that Peter and John began to show concern about the matter. If any people were fully aware of what Christ did and taught, and if any people were able to sanction the accuracy of any written history of Christ’s life, it was the apostles. Something had to be done to provide a shining light of truth to those of the future. It was within this background that Peter wrote what we call today his Second Epistle. Let us see what Peter did to secure for those of the succeeding centuries the purity of Christian teaching. The principal subject of Peter’s Second Epistle was “the precious and exceeding great promises” of Christ (2 Peter 1:12). To preserve these for posterity he explained what he was about to do. “Wherefore, I shall be ready, always, to remind you of these things [the promises of Christ], though you know and are firmly fixed in the present truth [the truth that Peter was presently giving them]. And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle [this mortal body], to stir you up by reminder, knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle comes swiftly, even as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. But I will also give diligence that at each time [notice this phrase ‘at each time’] you may be able after my death to recall these things to remembrance. For not by following cunningly devised fables, made we known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. Http://www.askelm.com/restoring/res023.htm *** The irony is that Martin understood Western politics influenced the modern bible layout (OT and NT) and has corrupted academia, yet he still trusted in the party line that the original texts were in Greek even while turning to the Aramaic (“Syriac Version”) to clinch the argument over the intended meaning of the Greek “phelonen” in support of his larger thesis — the Apostles canonized the NT. Martin was brilliant, but not infallible. To his credit he was known to change his mind on important subjects in light of new information — to what degree if any he studied the arguments for Aramaic primacy is unknown to me. His book also shows how the canon would have been finalized by St John in accordance with Torah law (being a priest like Ezra who finalized the OT canon — yes the biblical evidence shows John was from a priest family as was Judas) and creates a symmetry of 49 books (7×7) with 7 divisions mirroring the 7 branched menorah. The fact that the Peshitta NT does not include 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation may actually help date it prior to these letters being written and finalized by St John who lived to be almost 100 according to early tradition. The church of the East have always maintained that one of the 70 disciples, Addai (Thaddeus), sent by St Thomas, introduced the nascent NT to King Abgar in Edessa, the same who is said to have brought the image of Christ (Mandylion) to King Abgar to heal him. Western NT scholars would typically disregard the validity of this information as they would the validity of the shroud thanks in no small part to the 1988 C14 “tests”. Now to put the original NT language in historical context, Josephus makes abundantly clear that writings by Jews during this time would most definitely have been in Aramaic not Greek. Anything Greek was shunned especially after the Maccabean revolt with subsequent recognized Jewish autonomy and was rarely used by Jews (like Paul) with the exception of “Hellenized Jews” — as it’s said, the exception establishes the rule. The highly educated Josephus himself wrote his works in Aramaic and admits it was tough to learn and translate into the foreign and unaccustomed language (Greek). This would not be the case if Greek really was the lingua franca of Jewish communities that we are always assured it was in NT time by Western NT scholars, why else would the Roman commander posted in Jerusalem be surprised when Paul was able to address him in Greek, then proceeded to address the Jews in “the Hebrew tongue” (ie, Aramaic) in Acts 21.37 22.2? “Antiquity of the Jews” 1:7 but because this work surrounded a great deal… in process of time, as usually happens to such as undertake great things, I grew weary and went on slowly, it being a large subject, and a difficult thing to translate our history into a foreign, and to us unaccustomed, language. 1:129 for such names are pronounced here after the manner of the Greeks, to please my readers; for our own country language does not so pronounce them; 20:262 And I am so bold as to say, now I have so completely perfected the work I proposed to myself to do, that no other person, whether he were a Jew or foreigner, had he ever so great an inclination to it, could so accurately deliver these accounts to the Greeks as is done in these books. 20:263 For those of my own nation freely acknowledge that I far exceed them in the learning belonging to Jews: I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learning of the Greeks, and understand the elements of the Greek language, although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exactness; 20:264 for our nation does not encourage those who learn the languages of many nations, In Against Apion, Josephus also shows that “Antiquity” was originally written in his own national tongue and only subsequently translated into Greek (with great effort as stated above): 1:1 My books of the “Antiquity of the Jews” … Those Antiquities contain the history of five thousand years, and are taken out of our sacred books; but are translated by me into the Greek tongue. 1:50 Afterward I got leisure at Rome; and when all my materials were prepared for that work, I made use of some persons to assist me in learning the Greek tongue. Jewish War preface: “I have proposed to myself, for the sake of such as live under the government of the Romans, to translate those books into the Greek tongue, which I formerly composed in the language of our country” After the exile to Babylon, the lingua franca among the Jews who returned to the land (and stayed in Babylon) was Aramaic. This is why they always used the Aramaic Targumim, Talmuds, Mishna, and Midrash. Even the Hebrew bible relies on Aramaic (Syriac) after the exile and tells how Ezra translated the Hebrew bible for the Jews during readings, where the Targum tradition begins.

Biophotons, or ultraweak photon emissions of biological systems, are weak electromagnetic waves in the optical range of the spectrum – in other words: light. All living cells of plants, animals and human beings emit biophotons which cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be measured by special equipment developed by German researchers. This light emission is an expression of the functional state of the living organism and its measurement therefore can be used to assess this state. Cancer cells and healthy cells of the same type, for instance, can be discriminated by typical differences in biophoton emission. […] According to the biophoton theory developed on the base of these discoveries the biophoton light is stored in the cells of the organism – more precisely, in the DNA molecules of their nuclei – and a dynamic web of light constantly released and absorbed by the DNA may connect cell organelles, cells, tissues, and organs within the body and serve as the organism’s main communication network and as the principal regulating instance for all life processes. The processes of morphogenesis, growth, differentiation and regeneration are also explained by the structuring and regulating activity of the coherent biophoton field. The holographic biophoton field of the brain and the nervous system, and maybe even that of the whole organism, may also be basis of memory and other phenomena of consciousness, as postulated by neurophysiologist Karl Pribram an others. The consciousness like coherence properties of the biophoton field are closely related to its base in the properties of the physical vacuum and indicate its possible role as an interface to the non physical realms of mind, psyche and consciousness. The discovery of biophoton emission also lends scientific support to some unconventional methods of healing based on concepts of homeostasis (self regulation of the organism), such as various somatic therapies, homeopathy and acupuncture. The “ch’i” energy flowing in our bodies’ energy channels (meridians) which according to Traditional Chinese Medicine regulates our body functions may be related to node lines of the organism’s biophoton field. The “prana” of Indian Yoga physiology may be a similar regulating energy force that has a basis in weak, coherent electromagnetic biofields. Background First discovered in 1923 by Russian medical scientist Professor Alexander G.Gurvich (who named them “mitogenetic rays”) and in the 1930s widely researched in Europe and the USA, biophotons have been rediscovered and backed since the 1970s by ample experimental and theoretical evidence by European scientists. In 1974 German biophysicist Fritz Albert Popp has proved their existence, their origin from the DNA and later their coherence (laser like nature), and has developed biophoton theory to explain their possible biological role and the ways in which they may control biochemical processes, growth, differentiation etc. Popp’s biophoton theory leads to many startling insights into the life processes and may well provide one of the major elements of a future theory of life and holistic medical practice based on such an approach. The importance of the discovery has been confirmed by eminent scientists such as Herbert Froehlich and Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine. Since 1992, the International Institute of Biophysics, a network of research laboratories in more than 10 countries, based in Germany, is coordinating research in this field which promises rapid development in the next decade.

[…] And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
