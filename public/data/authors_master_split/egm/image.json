[{"id":"comment-18940","author":"egm","post":"Daveb of wellington nz : this marvellous creation cannot be called miraculous, if we stick to the strict meaning of the word. For all that we ordinarily see is in accord with its own nature. A miracle can only be said to occur when something happens that transcends its nature, and it requires divine intervention to bring it about. That’s the point, the miracles that happen are in accordance with nature and not in violation of it. Let’s not mistake breaking the laws of nature with “freak” occurrences at just the right moment which is foretold or signaled somehow, ie, Christ fulfilling 100s of minute details of prophecy/laws/calendar feasts/foreshadowing/astronomical signs the magi saw and we can see with professional software giving powerful signs, etc, or Moses told to raise his staff, then a strong wind blew all night until the sea parted (wind setdown) and “congealed” just long enough for them to pass — and there just happens to be a narrow underwater ridge with a gentle slope still seen today — til the waters finally crashed down on the Egyptians behind them, etc. Re: transcending nature – Man some 500 years ago would’ve said huge mechanical metal birds cruising through the air 1000s of miles carrying tons of cargo would be in violation of the laws of nature/transcend nature – but that doesn’t make it so. Miracles do not transcend nature simply because they are a part of nature, and must be, otherwise how does one witness them in the first place via natural phenomena (sight, hearing, touching?). Saying miracles must not be able to have a logical/scientific explanation is to rig the deck from the start; it’s almost miraculous how widespread such an absurd idea has caught on. As far as I know, it was Thomas Aquinas who first popularized (re popularized?) this schizophrenia and we’ve been plagued ever since. Nature itself (as we know it) required “divine intervention” because before law and order existed in the universe (as we know it) via the Word/Logos or as in the Aramaic NT, “Miltha” (meaning “word”, “matter”, “manifestation”, “power”, “utterance”, etc.), there was chaos/darkness. And as an aside because this goes back to something brought up before: the “Logos” idea is widely assumed to be a Greek concept, however this ignores the fact that the primordial “Word” was already mentioned in the Hebrew OT, for example: Psalm 33:6 “By the word [dabar] of YHWH the heavens were made, And by the breath of His mouth all their host.” Psalm 147:15 “He sends forth His command [imrah] to the earth; His word [dabar] runs very swiftly.” This “Word” took on extensive anthropomorphic development in the Aramaic Targumim which were read side by side with the Hebrew as a paraphrase/explanation in ancient synagogue after the return from Babylon when everyone spoke Aramaic and most forgot Hebrew. This tradition goes back to Nehemiah 8.8 “So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.” Also, from Gill’s Exposition: “The phrase, “the word of the Lord”, so frequently used by the Targumists, is well known: and it is to be observed, that the same things which John here says of the word, they say likewise, as will be observed on the several clauses; from whence it is more likely, that John should take this phrase, since the paraphrases of Onkelos and Jonathan ben Uzziel were written before his time, than that he should borrow it from the writings of Plato, or his followers, as some have thought; with whose philosophy, Ebion and Cerinthus are said to be acquainted; wherefore John, the more easily to gain upon them, uses this phrase, when that of the Son of God would have been disagreeable to them: that there is some likeness between the Evangelist John and Plato in their sentiments concerning the word, will not be denied. Amelius (f), a Platonic philosopher, who lived after the times of John, manifestly refers to these words of his, in agreement with his master’s doctrine” … “In which words it is easy to observe plain traces of what the evangelist says in the first four verses, and in the fourteenth verse of this chapter [ch 1]; yet it is much more probable, that Plato had his notion of the Logos, or word, out of the writings of the Old Testament, than that John should take this phrase, or what he says concerning the word, from him; since it is a matter of fact not disputed, that Plato went into Egypt to get knowledge: not only Clemens Alexandrinus a Christian writer says, that he was a philosopher of the Hebrews (g), and understood prophecy (h), and stirred up the fire of the Hebrew philosophy (i); but it is affirmed by Heathen writers, that he went into Egypt to learn of the priests (k), and to understand the rites of the prophets (l); and Aristobulus, a Jew, affirms (m), he studied their law; and Numenius, a Pythagoric philosopher (n), charges him with stealing what he wrote, concerning God and the world, out of the books of Moses; and used to say to him, what is Plato, but Moses “Atticising?” or Moses speaking Greek: and Eusebius (o), an ancient Christian writer, points at the very places, from whence Plato took his hints: wherefore it is more probable, that the evangelist received this phrase of the word, as a divine person, from the Targums, where there is such frequent mention made of it; or however, there is a very great agreement between what he and these ancient writings of the Jews say of the word, as will be hereafter shown..” http://gill.biblecommenter.com/john/1.htm I think, as Daniel prophesied, knowledge would be increased in latter generations and this is what is happening. Many of the prophecies in the bible sounded impossible in previous generations, but nowadays they are feasible, such as the whole world seeing the two witnesses killed and resurrect three days later in Jerusalem — possible now with satellite tv — or every Israelite sniffed out in every corner of the world and brought back to Israel –possible now with the world wide DNA database and Genetic Anthropology spearheaded by IBM and National Geographics Society.. Btw IBM (Thomas Watson) were the ones who set up and ran the punchcard system Hitler employed to track and profile the Jews, see “IBM and the Holocaust” by Edwin Black.

I certainly do think they are allegorical, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t really happen either. The bible/God uses our physical world as a metaphor to express higher spiritual meaning. I find it interesting how water plays a such prominent role in the miracles of the bible, NT and OT, from God calling forth the earth and animals out of water to Christ turning it to wine, and is used extensively to express spiritual ideas (baptism/born again, water of life, etc). It’s the most abundant chemical on earth’s surface and in the human body and it’s probably the most versatile and exotic in chemistry. Scientists are at a loss to explain exactly why it should expand its crystalline structure after dropping below 4 degrees Celsius, yet it is crucial for supporting life on earth. There have been some recent discoveries about H2 O including that it is able to retain “memory” and the magnetic fields put out by our brains can effect it (such as when you are angry or when saying a prayer). Linus Pauling talked about “structured water” as well. People will always ridicule who aren’t ready for this and unfortunately for those a little too eager for this there are some new age spin off products and disinfo surrounding this research, so take heed. I found an interesting documentary on this subject “Water: The Great Mystery” you can check at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b j R7sww WY After I first watched this film I was reminded of a passage from Ecclesiastical History (AD 323) by Eusebius CHAPTER IX. The Miracles of Narcissus. The citizens of that parish mention many other miracles of Narcissus, on the tradition of the brethren who succeeded him; among which they relate the following wonder as performed by him. They say that the oil once failed while the deacons were watching through the night at the great paschal vigil. Thereupon the whole multitude being dismayed, Narcissus directed those who attended to the lights, to draw water and bring it to him. This being immediately done he prayed over the water, and with firm faith in the Lord, commanded them to pour it into the lamps. And when they had done so, contrary to all expectation by a wonderful and divine power, the nature of tim water was changed into that of oil. A small portion of it has been preserved even to our day by many of the brethren there as a memento of the wonder. They tell many other things worthy to be noted of the life of this man, among which is this.

Perhaps this idea itself needs to be reevaluated? As a Christian I believe nature itself is miraculous. The more we learn about it, the more mysterious and bizarre it all is — counter intuitive you could even say. Ever heard of the “miracles of science”? 600 years ago the common man would’ve called our smart phones a “miracle” or “magic.” Being able to explain how it works (to an extent) doesn’t make it any less amazing as we see how the faithful, impalpable and invisible laws of nature — implicating such a faithful law giver — work together and are amenable to our sensorium, nay, our very existence and reality. “Miracles” become all the more impressive when studied with the tools of science/logic, not despite them. “Supernatural” is not a biblical term anyway. Rather, miracles of the bible are very often rare, unusual, highly ‘synchronistic’ events (“signs”) that bear witness to a higher authority in control of events or time/space (interestingly the Hebrew term מוֹעֵד ‘moed’ can mean time or space). Miracles occur in nature because we are in nature, otherwise how could one bear witness to a miracle without using natural phenomena (sight, hearing, touching, etc)? But miracles don’t have to be one off events in history — human reproduction itself is a miracle, yet it happens constantly. Science by itself cannot explain why it should happen at all, or how it does what it does; we can just tell a bit about what happens as it occurs, muck around with various processes and given materials, but we cannot recreate it from scratch (reproduce reproduction?) with sheer ingenuity, which would only be a product of our nature anyways. This is not to say we never could. As a Christian I also believe we will inherit all the mysteries of nature and be One with Elohim in YHWH as Christ is One body. But before this power is fully invested, one must be purified to enter in the inheritance, born of the spirit, otherwise you have chaos and confusion: Genesis 11:6 9 “And the LORD [YHWH] said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech. So the LORD [YHWH] scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel [Confusion]; because the LORD [YHWH] did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD [YHWH] scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.” This scattering and confusion was an act of mercy, otherwise the unrestrained wickedness of man would leave no flesh left alive. Man is not ready for the responsibility of such awesome power, so this life is an opportunity to test of our talents to see what we are to inherit in the next, tried in the fire and purified as silver, but we have the potential in us now being made in the image of Elohim, and under the righteous rule of Yeshua we will be given this authority as sons of Elohim to subdue all misguided authorities and powers to bring out their best and share in their glory as one “And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all” 1 Corinthians 15:28. “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is” 1 John 3:2. The shroud is a palpable token of this hope, a record of eternal life, being careful not to idolize it. For those with ears to hear: 1 John 5:4 21 “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that bear record: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.” 2 Corinthians 3:18 – 4:18 “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass [mirror, ie mirror image] the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels [Murdoch tr: in an earthen vessel], that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death worketh in us, but life in you. We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you. For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;” Paul like John, reminds us not to idolize this token of the miraculous: “While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”.","date":"2012-11-08","mins":"2:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/07/you-shroudies-and-your-fallacious-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"You shroudies and your fallacious thinking"},{"id":"comment-47903","author":"egm","post":"“we have no solid reason for thinking the image represents reflected light on a man’s body” Good point. Now I know it’s greatly frowned upon by some designated pro authentication gatekeeprs here, but dare we suggest that the light represented on the shroud is not reflected off the body because rather it came from the body? Imagine that — the shroud visually documents an exotic phenomenon predictable by both OT and NT texts and heavily hinted at in the very narrative surrounding the burial/resurrection of Christ where the shroud would have been during such an event! Hmm, that’s too obvious, let’s just call it a metaphor and quickly move on from this predetermined dead end without looking deeper into it first! For those who can suppress the emotional knee jerk and want to scientifically investigate the possibility — is there some documented phenomenon in nature that could at the very least hint at light emitting from the human form? If so, could it under some unusual circumstance be increased to a high enough degree to be seen by the naked eye or physically alter material like the shroud? Are there any leads in the scientific literature of such a strange phenomenon existing? Biophotons – The Light in Our Cells From: http://transpersonal.de/mbischof/englisch/webbookeng.htm What are biophotons ? Biophotons, or ultraweak photon emissions of biological systems, are weak electromagnetic waves in the optical range of the spectrum – in other words: light. All living cells of plants, animals and human beings emit biophotons which cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be measured by special equipment developed by German researchers. This light emission is an expression of the functional state of the living organism and its measurement therefore can be used to assess this state. Cancer cells and healthy cells of the same type, for instance, can be discriminated by typical differences in biophoton emission. […] According to the biophoton theory developed on the base of these discoveries the biophoton light is stored in the cells of the organism – more precisely, in the DNA molecules of their nuclei – and a dynamic web of light constantly released and absorbed by the DNA may connect cell organelles, cells, tissues, and organs within the body and serve as the organism’s main communication network and as the principal regulating instance for all life processes. The processes of morphogenesis, growth, differentiation and regeneration are also explained by the structuring and regulating activity of the coherent biophoton field. The holographic biophoton field of the brain and the nervous system, and maybe even that of the whole organism, may also be basis of memory and other phenomena of consciousness, as postulated by neurophysiologist Karl Pribram an others. The consciousness like coherence properties of the biophoton field are closely related to its base in the properties of the physical vacuum and indicate its possible role as an interface to the non physical realms of mind, psyche and consciousness. The discovery of biophoton emission also lends scientific support to some unconventional methods of healing based on concepts of homeostasis (self regulation of the organism), such as various somatic therapies, homeopathy and acupuncture. The “ch’i” energy flowing in our bodies’ energy channels (meridians) which according to Traditional Chinese Medicine regulates our body functions may be related to node lines of the organism’s biophoton field. The “prana” of Indian Yoga physiology may be a similar regulating energy force that has a basis in weak, coherent electromagnetic biofields. Background First discovered in 1923 by Russian medical scientist Professor Alexander G.Gurvich (who named them “mitogenetic rays”) and in the 1930s widely researched in Europe and the USA, biophotons have been rediscovered and backed since the 1970s by ample experimental and theoretical evidence by European scientists. In 1974 German biophysicist Fritz Albert Popp has proved their existence, their origin from the DNA and later their coherence (laser like nature), and has developed biophoton theory to explain their possible biological role and the ways in which they may control biochemical processes, growth, differentiation etc. Popp’s biophoton theory leads to many startling insights into the life processes and may well provide one of the major elements of a future theory of life and holistic medical practice based on such an approach. The importance of the discovery has been confirmed by eminent scientists such as Herbert Froehlich and Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine. Since 1992, the International Institute of Biophysics, a network of research laboratories in more than 10 countries, based in Germany, is coordinating research in this field which promises rapid development in the next decade.

Mark 9:2 3 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them; and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them. Luke 9:29 And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment [became] white [and] dazzling. Luke 24:3 4 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.
