An authenticity finding of the Shroud fundamentally changes our secular world view. For instance, the Shroud depicts a crucifixtion victim exactly as described in the Gospel of John, the last written Gospel, and academically considered very unreliable as a historical source, if not outright fiction. Obviously, John and the other gospels would now have to be considered reliable historical sources should the Shroud be authentic. Critical historians, theologians would literally have to “go back to the drawing board.” Moreover, science and physics in considering the image and a first century date, as well as the Gospel stories of the resurrected Jesus materializing into locked rooms, etc., would be faced with questions current physics/science are ill equipped to answer. That is why you see reasonable, educated people continually saying things that are demonstrably false or simply ludicrous, e.g., “the shroud is a painting”; “it’s a negative like any other of the middle ages,” or “even if it dates to the first century, there’s no reason to believe it was the Shroud of Jesus,” etc. I am not convinced of the Shroud’s authenticity, but I am convinced that the truth must be discovered. And incorrect world views or academic beliefs must be relegated to the dustbin of history if they do not match the known historical facts. Let’s hope we have courage to honestly acknowledge those facts…whatever they may be..","date":"2014-11-12","mins":"1:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/why-the-images-and-bloodstains-were-not-painted-on/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Why the images and bloodstains were not painted on"}]
