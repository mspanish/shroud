[{"id":"comment-181831","author":"c_reid","post":"Hello all! Glad to see you all are well and fine this morning. This will be my first time commenting on this blog (I have little knowledge in science, so I hope its ok that I post here! I come here in pure ignorance, hoping to learn from responses and educate myself further on this subject)! I’ve been watching it since I discovered the shroud in November 2014. Ever since then, I’ve been completely hooked on the mystery of it all. I’ve watched and read almost everything I could on the shroud, from Mr. Barrie Schwartz to Russ Breault. I’ve read some of the papers from the late Dr. Alan Adler (May he rest in peace) and John Heller, Kelly Kearse, the late Raymond Rogers (May he also rest in peace), and Giulia Fanti. I try to understand as much as I can when reading these papers, but some of it just goes over top of my head unfortunately. Sometimes I have to pick words out and look them because I want to understand the science behind this shroud better. This specific article has caught my attention. As I stated, I come here with the opportunity to present my opinions and learn from them best in the shroud world. Ever since I watched Mr. Breault’s “What If”, I think he actually poses the greatest question to the Shroud of Turin. What if this is actually authentic, and we did nothing with it? Which of course, we are doing all we can! When it comes to my personal opinion, I believe we are staring the divinity of Christ right in the face. The evidence alone is astounding, and its hard for me to believe that some people completely rule the shroud out from being authentic because of the carbon dating. But, that discussion is for another time. My few questions deal with the blood and blood shapes, mostly from the few things i’ve read from the comments. I thought the blood was confirmed to be human male blood of the AB group? I remember reading that Dr. Adler said that it was “Primate”, but that Prof. Baima Bollone confirmed it to be human AB blood? I also believe that the blood on the front of the head to be genuine, from personal experience of having surgery on my head while I was awake. When I was younger, I use to have long hair (Maybe as long as the Turin shroud man’s hair, maybe slightly shorter.) and not only did I have blood matted in my hair, but it also flowed in nice rivulets down the side of my face. I would imagine that, if they carried this man from the cross, it would of been down while he was in the shroud, which could of possibly of caused the blood to look the way it is on the shroud?.","date":"2015-01-07","mins":"9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"},{"id":"comment-181868","author":"c_reid","post":"Ha, I can say that I couldn’t fathom a forger either rounding up monkeys for this shroud either, especially without any real knowledge at the time that humans and monkeys even shared almost common DNA. Its even harder for me to imagine a forger at all making this shroud without its already mysterious properties, but that is a discussion for another time. My question is then (unless I misunderstood you), if we are not sure it is human male blood, what would be the chances that it would be?.","date":"2015-01-07","mins":"12:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"}]
