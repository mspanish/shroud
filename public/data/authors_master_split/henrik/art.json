All the characters (cherubs included) seem to observe the side which is not being displayed. You could however point to creases in the weave and barely discernible intensity differences in certain areas in the upper part of the shroud as proof of the seam of the shroud running along the top. This was actually my initial impression. But in the end I think this is an example of pareidolia for what we both want to see. Stronger arguments for explaining away the faintness would be required..","date":"2015-02-02","mins":"11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/01/picture-for-today-2/","cat":"art","title":"Picture for Today"},{"id":"comment-191407","author":"henrik","post":"Thanks, I will take a look at this..","date":"2015-02-19","mins":"6:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"id":"comment-191356","author":"henrik","post":"Daveb: “I recall that Scavone (still apparently a supporter of the Mandylion theory) gives citations indicating that the “Image of God Incarnate” did include a body image,…” Do you have any reference?.","date":"2015-02-18","mins":"7:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"id":"comment-188477","author":"henrik","post":"Yes the backing cloth was there in 1650 so the artist probably didn´t know what the reversed side looked like.

As you wrote, I think that the restoration is the greatest source of uncertainty in this case. The hypothesis of the loincloth is certainly an interesting one. But couldn´t Trent instead have influenced the artists who copied the SOT directly to add the garment in their paintings?

Long flowing hair in the neck. Burnmarks at a safe distance from the body. Large margin from the feet to the end of the garment and so on. The shroud seems to have more in common with earlier exhibition copies than the SOT itself even if photographs of the shroud were accessible in 1931. Hugh Farey suggested earlier that a category of SOT copies (where the shroud is being held up) descended from a single copy of the original kept in the same place. Perhaps the common features within the tradition can be explained on the basis of mutual inspiration? This was simply the version of the Shroud that belonged to the common mindset during a couple of centuries in the same way as the negative contrast enhanced versions of the SOT, that show up on google, is how people imagine the shroud nowadays.

Although the resolution is poor, it is possible to distinguish the date of 1527 down at the left corner. I will though grant Freeman the point he frequently have made about the visible elbows which can be seen in the dorsal images of the two pre fire Noalejo copies – this will surely add some constraints on how the shroud wrapped the person/object during image formation, like if the person/object would have had to press the dorsal side of the shroud into spices/sand, or if the person/object never was used in the first place.

This does not exclude the possiblity though that Jesus remained in the shroud during the entire stay in the tomb (but you think that the Gospel of John suggests otherwise?). Maybe they interpreted the visible elbows as proof of an image formation taking place during the initial phase while the body where carried down from the cross or to the tomb – I don´t think that´s a very strong point in itself – without asserting that the elbows don’t fit into your historical reconstruction or your school of image mechanisms..","date":"2015-01-22","mins":"9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"}]
