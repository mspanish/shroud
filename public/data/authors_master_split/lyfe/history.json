If you read Wilson’s 2010 book he gives the impression that the cloth is referred to as tetradiplon only AFTER it has become the image of Edessa. In the Acts of Thaddeus there is, though Wilson does not tell us this, a SERARATE reference to the burial cloths as remaining in the tomb.

It does seem to undermine the Freeman argument that tetradiplon referred to the way the Edessa Image was folded for storage, after the image was made, but it does seem to support Freeman (and you) when he says never trust Wilson without reading the documents he quotes for yourself. They often say something completely different from what he says they say and anyone who bothers can find this out on the internet. Not a difficult man to out and you have done some good work here. As you say , you can take out ALL the Wilson stuff and still have an authentic Shroud..","date":"2012-07-14","mins":"1:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13917","author":"lyfe","post":"Yannick. You have hit on a big problem. Too few people have seen that Wilson’s theory of the Edessa Image being the same as the Turin Shroud has had zero support from any specialist working in this field. Because they go on believiing it ,people have failed to do any work at looking at the other ways in which the history of the Shroud might be traced. If only Wilson could be discared you would release a lot of new ideas some of which might have more evidence to support them.","date":"2012-07-17","mins":"9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13840","author":"lyfe","post":"Max, I think it is you who must do the explaining. 1) The only source Wilson gives for tetradiplon is The Acts of the Holy Apostle Thaddeus, sixth century. Do you know of any others as it is important we have all the known examples to work from? 2) In the Acts the word is only used to describe the sindon ( a normal name for a linen cloth) BEFORE Jesus wiped his face with it. In other words a cloth was brought that was tetradiplon ,and THEN given to Jesus. The word tetradiplon is, so far as I know not used otherwise. So how does Wilson deal with this? P. 190. 2010 edition of The Shroud. ‘Although its initially off putting aspect [of the Acts] is that it ‘explains’ the creation of the Image as by Jesus washing himself, it intriguingly GOES ON [my capitals] to describe the cloth on which the Image was imprinted as tetradiplon’. Now by using ‘goes on’ Wilson implies that tetradiplon is used of the cloth AFTER the image is on it, instead of BEFORE as the Acts make clear. Is he simply being imprecise or is he deliberately misleading? Please let us know what you think. He is misleadng on sindon. Look up any traditional Greek lexicon, e.g. Lddell and Scott and you will find the word probably originated as cloth from India but then became a generic term for fine linen or just linen. So forget any connection with burial shrouds from the gospels, this is simply a linen cloth being brought to Jesus for him to wipe his image on. Wilson also makes great play about a four folded cloth having to be large nonsense if you have a pocket handkerchief you will see that during ironing, if you do such thngs, it is folded over four times. (Sometimes being the family ironer pays off!) So size has nothing to do with it. As Yannick suggests this makes Jackson’s folding irrelevant to the issue. Read on in the Acts and there is a separate reference to the crucifixion and burial of Jesus with the burial cloths described in the same Acts as being LEFT in the tomb. (This would not,of course, stop them from being gathered from there and becoming what is now the Turin Shroud.) So it is up to you to provide any reason why these burial cloths should be tetradiplon. Contrary to what Wilson argues it is the AC Ts temsleves, the very document he uses, that destroys his own argument about tetradiplon. By using ‘goes on’ you could say he is being misleading by misrepresenting the order of events as set out in the Acts and so creating an argument that has never existed. This is why Yannick feels so strongly about these things it only needs a little,bit of research, and Yannick has done a lot to see how quickly much of what Wilson writes collapses when the original sources are consulted..","date":"2012-07-14","mins":"7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"id":"comment-13705","author":"lyfe","post":"Please help as I am confused.An ordinary handkerchief that one takes out of a drawer is folded four times so tetradiplon cloth does not have to be large. In the only reference to tetradiplon I can find (the Acts of Thaddeus) tetradiplon describes the cloth BEFORE Christ wipes his face with it so it can’t be the Turin Shroud. The Acts also say that the burial shrouds,not the same cloth, remained in the tomb. So perhaps there are some documents I have missed.

It does leave open the question as to which is the first portrait of Jesus that shows the Vignon markings when they have not been present in any earlier portrait. Everyone knows the problem of looking at the Shroud of Turinwithout any enhancement. Some people say that they can only see the face if they stand some way back from it and that theycannot see any markings clearly if they look at it close up. I remain amazed that when there is such a fuss over the Vignon markings when we have according to Stephen Jones,a man who admits that he is replacing science by meditation and can give no clear account that he has examined the Shroud carefullybut ,of course ‘if you already know exactly what you are looking for and where’ youare bound to find it!

I think everyone is agreed that the Ravenna Pantocrator was made before Wilson says that the Image of Edessa was discovered in the wall in Edessa.I asked a friend who knows about Byzantine art for his view on the date ( he has studied the Ravenna mosaics) and he thinks it is about 500 AD (the same date you get if you put Christ Enthroned, Sant’Apollinare Nuovo in the Sacred Destinations website)because it was completed before the church was consecrated in 504. He said this is the view of Robert Cormack who is an expert on Byzantine art. I think your point that the Image of Edessa has many similarities with earlier art is a very interesting one and it does make sense because of the fully frontal bearded face.

(Stephen Jones prefers the Markwardt’s Antioch theory over Wilson’s Edessa theory for the early hiding of the Shroud.)The presence of Vignon markings in earlier Christian and imperial art has always been a problem for Wilson’s theory of the copying of the Shroud in the sixth century.
