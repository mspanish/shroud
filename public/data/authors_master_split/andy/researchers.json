[{"id":"comment-76301","author":"andy","post":"Honestly Dan, I don’t expect any non sentimentality from Colin when it comes to STURP members, scientists or anyone else. He has lambasted Rogers (among others) when he was not able to defend himself. It seems to me Colin simply doesn’t like Rogers. He may pretend its scientific, but his character assaults of him in these blogs of which I am a witness gives him no credibility at all in the issue. I will not listen to Colin. There are many real scientists who can at least be honest and fair, even if they disagree with conclusions (anyone’s)..","date":"2014-02-03","mins":"8:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/31/colin-berry-on-rogers-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Colin Berry on Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"id":"comment-84244","author":"andy","post":"Glad you can walk the dog again, Dan.

It has never suffered chemically significant radiation with either protons or neutrons. No type of radiation that could produce either color in the linen fibers or change in the C14 content (radiocarbon age) could go unnoticed. All radiation has some kind of an effect on organic materials. This proves that the image color could not have been produced by thermal or radiation induced dehydration of the cellulose. Image formation proceeds at normal temperatures in the absence of energetic radiation of any kind.” – Shroud of Turin FAQ, Raymond N.
