It has never suffered chemically significant radiation with either protons or neutrons. No type of radiation that could produce either color in the linen fibers or change in the C14 content (radiocarbon age) could go unnoticed. All radiation has some kind of an effect on organic materials. This proves that the image color could not have been produced by thermal or radiation induced dehydration of the cellulose. Image formation proceeds at normal temperatures in the absence of energetic radiation of any kind.”.","date":"2015-04-18","mins":"4:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/18/feature-story-in-national-geographic/","cat":"article","title":"Feature Story in National Geographic"},{"id":"comment-197521","author":"andy","post":"Joe might want to invest in the flat earth society if he discounts the expert work of STURP.
