On one hand no one wants to be described as “anti science.” Yet I am smart enough to know that science is often agenda driven and heavily influenced by money, politics and the world view of those doing the science. Once something has become dogma in the scientific world, try getting a peer reviewed journal article published that espouses a contrary view. Science can be just as dogmatic as any religion. While I don’t describe myself as a “young earther”, I also hold great skepticism towards science models that hold to a godless evolutionary view where all can be explained by random chance and natural selection. Within academia, to even mention Intelligent Design is tantamount to treason and heresy. Yet the principle of ID is clearly taught in Scripture….”The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament reveals his handiwork.” God is first and foremost the Creator. Secular science wants to strip Him of this glory by attributing everything to natural causes. I don’t buy it.
