It hugely elevated the status of women. If the story was made up, they would have never casted women as the messengers. The numerous eye witness accounts of his post resurrection appearances are also huge because he didn’t just “appear” like some kind of UFO sighting but he sat and talked with them about the Kingdom. My point however was that there we no eyewitnesses to the actual resurrection event itself. Yet we DO have three witnesses to fulfill the mandate of Deuteronomy 19:15—an empty tomb, a vacant shroud, and a napkin lying next to it..","date":"2013-05-23","mins":"6:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/23/a-kind-of-witness/","cat":"event","title":"A kind of witness?"},{"id":"comment-22676","author":"shroud_encounter","post":"Dan, is there any way to find out if this talk will be taped or webcast?

Regardless of who is speaking, whether you agree with their particular paper or not, it will be a wonderful time for all involved to connect or connect again. Some of my fondest memories dating all the way back to the Paris conference in 1989 are simply making new friends and then reconnecting at subsequent conferences. It is a time of wonderful camaraderie and fellowship. Stop worrying about the minutia. There will be papers you agree with and those you won’t. But the relationships you build and cultivate will be priceless. Mealtime get togethers and late night cocktails with old friends and new–that is what I look forward to. With the right attitude, we can all help make this a great conference–even if we don’t all agree..","date":"2013-10-26","mins":"6:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/26/some-thoughts-on-the-st-louis-conference-announcement/","cat":"event","title":"Some thoughts on the St. Louis conference announcement"},{"id":"comment-24938","author":"shroud_encounter","post":"Ron, I will be in Kitchener, Ontario March 21, 22 and 23.

It varies. I am seriously bummed. We will have to pull each one into an edit program, raise the audio levels and then repost to Youtube. I think the first thing to do is take them all down and gradually replace them as we get them edited.
