Meanwhile our junk media will cover the story as though it was a breaking news headline and Hollywood won’t be far behind. That is the problem, no one pays attention to the serious scholars. If they did, this paper would never get published..","date":"2013-01-09","mins":"5:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"id":"comment-8655","author":"shroud_encounter","post":"Thanks for posting Dan. My daughter is a film major at UGA…I am finally getting a return on my investment. The purpose of the video is to make use of social media. Of course all the standard fare is also produced such as a press release and posters but the world communicates now through Facebook and video. Hopefully those interested will re post to their own FB pages to invite their friends..","date":"2012-02-23","mins":"3:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/23/shroud-encounter-coming-to-the-richmond-virginia-area-in-march/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Shroud Encounter coming to the Richmond, Virginia area in March"},{"id":"comment-14487","author":"shroud_encounter","post":"A great milestone Dan!
