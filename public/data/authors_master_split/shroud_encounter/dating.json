I don’t see that there is a will to undertake all the logisitics necessary to make it acceptable to all parties. The position of the Church, calling it a “symbol of Christ’s sufferings worthy of veneration” gets them off the hook. Who can argue with word, “symbol”? It is a smart position for them to take…not calling it a relic or an icon. That position however allows them to be perfectly comfortable with the ambiguity regarding the carbon date or any other unanswered questions of science..","date":"2012-04-29","mins":"9:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/carbon-dating-the-shroud-of-turin-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Carbon Dating the Shroud of Turin Again?"},{"id":"comment-11006","author":"shroud_encounter","post":"There are too many references to light in Scripture for it to be ignored. Especially when you consider that the bible says that “God is spirit” and it also says “God is light”. It is therefore not unreasonable to postulate that when Jesus returned to pure spirit, light was involved. The Mount of Transfiguration was a major clue: “His face shone like the sun and his clothing became white as the light.” You can believe that he just vanished without a trace. But I believe like a rock thrown into a pond…the ripple effect of his departure was light..","date":"2012-04-30","mins":"2:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers"},{"id":"comment-11002","author":"shroud_encounter","post":"Here is where the materialists like Dawkins, Hawking and Krauss get it wrong. They fail to understand that theology is a continuum of science…it picks up where science leave off. For instance, Hebrews 11:3 says, ” By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.” That is a big clue: “WHAT IS SEEN WAS NOT MADE OUT OF WHAT WAS VISIBLE.” But if all you are looking for is what is visible, you will totally miss it. I don’t know where the realm of the spirit is, it is probably parallel to our own physical world. Yet the scripture tells us that the spirit is eternal and the physical world is temporal. Ironically, the atheists of our day are consumed with what is temporary while denying that which is eternal. Scripture declares that Jesus is the image of the invisible God (Col 1:15). He came from the spirit realm, became physical for 33 years and returned to the spirit realm. Did the Shroud capture that split second in time when the physical body of Jesus returned to spirit (light)?.","date":"2012-04-30","mins":"12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers"}]
