I can only recommend reading Kat Kerr’s books on Revealing Heaven and you might feel a sense of relief that he is in heaven. You will find grief is different for each member of your family. My daughter refuses to talk about Scotty’s death. It takes a lot of time to heal. You probably won’t feel any healing for over a year. You never stop thinking of your child that is for sure. I hope GOD will heal your heart..","date":"2012-11-23","mins":"5:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-42827","author":"deb","post":"Hair that is wet is longer than dry hair so of course the shroud image would be longer.
