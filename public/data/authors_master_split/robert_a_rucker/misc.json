[{"id":"comment-206001","author":"robert_a_rucker","post":"Barry Schwortz’s report on the 2014 Shroud conference in St. Louise was quoted above as saying “[There was] a presentation on another radiation theory of image formation from Robert Rucker, in this case, claiming neutron radiation released from Jesus’ body during the Resurrection created the image. Naturally, this was well received by some in the audience, but not by everyone.” Unfortunately, this statement in Barrie’s report was in error. I used the MCNP nuclear analysis computer code to determine the effect of neutrons released from Jesus’ body on the C 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin and the Sudarium of Oviedo, but I said nothing about the neutrons creating the image. In fact, I strongly believe that neutrons had nothing to do with formation of the image. I have discussed this with Barrie, and he has now corrected his statement. My presentation was titled “MCNP Analysis of Neutrons Released from Jesus’ Body in the Resurrection.” Both my Power Point slides and my narration to them area available at shroud.com or can be located by doing a Google search on the title..","date":"2015-07-17","mins":"3:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/02/the-neutron-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Neutron Conference"}]
