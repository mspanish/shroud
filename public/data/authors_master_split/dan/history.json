Do they really check log files and do the detective work of figuring out to whom an IP address belongs? I’m more interested in who was kind enough to pass along the link then in who was first. Yes, it was Ottoman and probably less significant. Actually, it reminds us about trade even before then. The Romans maintained over 60,000 miles of roads that ran from Gaul and Spain all the way to Persia. Across those road traveled spices, dried foods, grains, olive oil, wool, cotton, leather, wood and leather goods, dyes, live animals, human slaves: going to and fro between major cities. Jerusalem was one such city with a population near 50,000 to 80,000 people. All major cities had thriving markets where you could buy goods from all over the known world to support necessities of life and unique cultural lifestyles, as well. One would surely find linen goods, too, for bedclothes, table coverings, draperies and clothing, maybe even for burial shrouds. Now it wasn’t like Amazon.com but it is still likely, I’m just guessing, of course, that at sometime, someone, in Jerusalem sold some z spun linen from somewhere. It is classic black swan thinking and I know some skeptics don’t like to ponder such possibilities. But then again, there are black swans in this world. Are you tracking my IP address, as well?

And, indeed, he thought a phase of the complex system (Maillard reaction) might continue for many days or even weeks until a latent image matured or developed to become visible. . I remember discussing this with Fr. Kim Dreisbach who was a very good friend of Rogers. Kim speculated that on that first Easter morning, one of Jesus followers, threw the rolled up shroud into a saddlebag or rump sack and fled from Jerusalem.

You are making many mistakes that could be corrected. For instance, after I reposted your text on Montfort and Anthon, Hugh Farey posted the following comment. You might want to fix your posting. Considering this is attempt to produce a definitive Encyclopaedia of the Shroud, a worthy cause, it is a shame that it is illustrated by a map which is admittedly misleading in at least two respects, namely the Templar route to ‘Paris 1307′, which has apparently been discarded, and the position of “Montfort 1418″, which turns out to be in the wrong place. Jones thinks that the Shroud did spend some time in the marked Montfort, but in 1358 1359, after which it moved to Anthon. However he gives no reference for this. The root of the various discussions regarding the Shroud’s movement at this time seems to be M. Bergeret’s Ohio Conference paper on ‘Linceul de Turin – Le Trou Historique’ which says that the Shroud moved to Montfort in 1360 and stayed there till 1389, and Dorothy Crispino’s ‘To know the Truth’ which says that it may have moved directly to Anthon in 1357 and stayed there till 1388. No doubt there are other variations on the theme.While the ruined Castle of Montfort is correctly illustrated, the photo of the Anthon Chateau is at Anthon, Isères, not Anthon, Haute Savoie, and is not associated with Aimon de Genève.Wishing you well, Stephen.Dan Porter.","date":"2015-02-17","mins":"10:10 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2015/02/locations-of-shroud-turin-shroud.html","title":"\nLocations of the Shroud: Lirey c.1355 - Chambéry 1471: Turin Shroud Encyclopedia \n"},{"id":"comment-215794","author":"dan","post":"To who, where, when?.","date":"2015-12-07","mins":"8:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/ssg-member-wants-to-know/","cat":"history","title":"SSG Member Wants to Know"},{"id":"comment-164958","author":"dan","post":"When I use the word significant it does not mean I agree with the article or am pleased with it..","date":"2014-10-23","mins":"4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-165137","author":"dan","post":"It is spreading: Christianity Today, NBC, Daily Mail, Yahoo News,.","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-69841","author":"dan","post":".","date":"2013-12-29","mins":"11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/28/the-sciatica-effect/","cat":"history","title":"The Sciatica Effect"},{"id":"comment-69809","author":"dan","post":"Thanks.
