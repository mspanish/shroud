The body is covered with blood from a rather dark color, except the blood from the wound in the side, which is much more red. Forearm blood stains are similar to the of the shroud.

Then there is this nice but far too short biography from the Miner Messenger, a publication of the alumni, friends, and parents of Bishop Manogue Catholic High School in Reno, Nevada. I wish I knew more. Chapel Stained Glass Artists Have International Reputation Bishop Manogue has been graced with the works of remarkable and internationally famous artists, the sisters Isabel and Edith Piczek. Both sisters were born in Hungary. They were friends of Sister Ida, Foundress of the Sacred Heart Sisters who provided years of ministry in the Diocese of Reno. Isabel, our principal contact, won a national competition for painting at a very early age, and at thirteen she decorated her first church with stained glass. Young Isabel, a Catholic, got herself into religious conflict with the communist government of Hungary and had to flee her country, accompanied by Edith, her sister and colleague. Almost immediately after her arrival in Rome, she won the International Grand Award for Painting and another competition to paint a 400 square foot fresco mural at the Vatican’s famous Pontifical Biblical Institute. She spent three years in Rome. During this time she completed another 42 murals at the Precious Blood Monastery of Rome and elsewhere. She also pursued her other interest, particle physics. Leaving Rome, Isabel came with her sister to the United Stated and with her she established her art studio, the Construction Art Center in Los Angeles. To date she has completed huge murals, mosaics, ceramic tile murals and stained glass windows for 493 churches and public buildings in seven countries on three continents. In addition to her outstanding work in the Bishop Manogue chapel, some of Isabel’s major works can be found at the St. Thomas Aquinas Cathedral and Our Lady of Snows parishes in Reno; the Guardian Angel Cathedral in Las Vegas; the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.; Holy Cross Mausoleum in Culver City, California; Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, California; and numerous other buildings in California, Rome, Canada, Illinois, New Mexico and elsewhere.

I offered to read a paper if you would write one. A reader if this blog was not so gentle. But if you are going to put up a You Tube video and make bold claims, like you do, you must expect criticism. You say,”If I can gain some trust and respect I will tell you all exactly how to do it.” Vinny, it doesn’t work that way. If you want trust and respect you will have to earn it. If you want to earn it, tell us exactly how you do it. I’ve looked at your shaky videos I don’t see stones over the eyes. I don’t see severed toes. You say, “I have explained on the clip which is now spreading around the net like a virus about the ripped toes how I develope the images.” No you have not explained anything with any satisfactory amount of detail. And your video is not going around like a virus. As of 12:15 GMT, your video has been viewed 40 times on You Tube. People aren’t even linking much from here. Here is what you wrote: “I take a close up of the Shroud image I am working on. I alter the frequency of the light angles and refilm. I repeat this process 2 or 3 times depending on how much clarity is required. On overlapping the new images which have had the light frequency altered the incredible and life like images are revealed. This is only made possible because the Shroud is a true photographic negative. To all Shroud scientists if you need more evidence arrange a place and time and you will then see exactly how I alter the light frequencies and over lay the images.” Film or digital? Which image of the Shroud? What magnification? What focal length, aperture, exposure? What different light frequencies? Overlapping using what algorithmic method? How do you know that the image is a true photographic negative? Time and place? Not a chance until you write up a proper paper that we can look at..","date":"2011-02-15","mins":"8:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/14/using-the-shroud-of-turin-as-a-rorschach-ink-blot/","cat":"art","title":"Using the Shroud of Turin as a Rorschach Ink Blot"},{"id":"comment-2740","author":"dan","post":"Where is the copy?

Lavoie be contacted Harvard University, requesting that you indicate the name of a professor who was a specialist in ancient iconography. He was given the name of Dr. Ernst Kitzinger. Who was this expert? Ernst Kitzinger, Jewish German born in Munich in 1912, one of the great art historian specializing in ancient art, medieval and Byzantine small group belonged to the prodigiously gifted German Art Historians, which included Richard Krautheimer, Erwin Panofsky and Kurt Witzmann, and developed most of its activity in the United States. During his tenure at Harvard University led the doctorates of several of his students like Christine Kondoleon, Irving Lavin, Henry Maguire, Lawrence Nees and William Tronzo, would in turn important art historians. The interested reader can find the citation for his important work and his biography on the “Dictionary of Art Historians,” Dictionary of Art Historians associated with Duke University http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/kitzingere.htm Lavoie was lucky Kitzinger could meet just before he left for England, where he planned to live out their retirement. The consultation Lavoie, who was working on the marks of blood, was: – Can you show work by artists who have painted as blood marks you see on the Shroud of Turin?. And this was the answer to Ernst Kitzinger: “The Shroud of Turin is unique in the art. Do not fall into any category of art. For us, a very small group of experts around the world, we believe that the Shroud of Turin is actually the Shroud of Constantinople. You know that the Crusaders took many treasures back to Europe in the thirteenth century and believe that the Shroud is one of them. As for the blood marks made by the artists, there are no pictures with marks of blood such as the Shroud. You are free to find ….. But do not find it. “.","date":"2011-12-27","mins":"8:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/27/waldemar-januszczak-doesnt-think-the-shroud-of-turin-is-real-but/","cat":"art","title":"Waldemar Januszczak doesn’t think the Shroud of Turin is real, BUT . . . (Updated)"},{"id":"comment-2470","author":"dan","post":"Vinny, I gave you a chance to promote your discoveries. I was critical of your approach. That’s true. I doubted your claims. That’s true. Your claims were, after all, extraordinary. You actually wrote: “I will answer any questions sincerely this is the biggest news in Shroud research in 113 years.” (sic) Well, you refused to answer. Instead you eventually wrote,”How can I now take you seriously when you see nothing at all its a total waste of time then, you see nothing so why tell you anything maybe we both need glasses.” (sic) What I said is I don’t see what you claim to see. I asked others to look and they don’t see stones over the eyes or severed toes. Then you went into You Tube and erased questions I had posed and comments that I made without any notification or explanation, as though they never existed. I will not erase existing comments you have made. It is poor netiquette to do so. Okay, let’s not waste any more time, Vinny. Until you can answer some very basic questions, as you so clearly said you would, this conversation is over. I expect nothing less than a two page paper with scientific details. At this point, I must ask you to have a scientist (or a high school science teacher) look it over before you send it to me.
