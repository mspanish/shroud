I never said that there wasn’t something miraculous going on. Words, indeed, do have meaning. The words dematerialization (of the sort that might produce byproducts to form an image) and commensurate rematerialization imply a process. Going through a door or a wall, or for that matter a floor or a ceiling, implies a process, as well. But it does not necessarily mean de re materialization. And then if we consider the way St. Thomas tells us angels come and go, we have another “miraculous going on” option that does not involve de re materialization. All of this is, of course, pure speculation. In other words there is no reason to infer dematerialization from scripture at the expense of any other possibility. There is a reason to infer something miraculous but  undefined. But…but…but, all this inferring, which may or may not be de re materialization, is valid only if we are assuming a literal reading of scripture. So to use any of it as evidence you must first prove that a literal interpretation is correct and justified. That is tricky and probably impossible..","date":"2015-11-17","mins":"11:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-214737","author":"dan","post":"No it is not.

The cloth – from a cassock John Paul was wearing in 1981 when a gunman tried to assassinate him – was taken in a burglary last weekend. The cloth was found in separate pieces in a garage of one of the three men arrested in connection with the theft. It has been put back together with only a few filaments of gold missing. Police are still looking for the remaining fragments. On Thursday officers had found the gold and glass case in which the relic was held but said the cloth was still missing. But on Friday, Bishop Giovanni D’Ercole told a press conference in L’Aquila that the cloth had now also been found and pieced together. “I think John Paul has forgiven them. I think we have to do the same,” Bishop D’Ercole said. The relic was taken during a burglary of the San Pietro della Ienca church. The three suspects apparently threw the cloth away, not realising its value. A small crucifix that was stolen along with the reliquary has also been recovered.

While I am sympathetic to what you say (I have a daughter who is an OWS protester) I think there is more to the story. Here is a letter from James Cooper the rector of Trinity. I agree with it: From time to time people of goodwill may disagree. We disagree with those who argue that Trinity should–indeed, must as a matter of conscience–allow Occupy Wall Street to liberate its Duarte Square lot at Avenue of the Americas and Canal Street for an open encampment and large scale assemblies. In all good conscience and faith, we strongly believe to do so would be wrong, unsafe, unhealthy and potentially injurious. Trinity has probably done as much or more for the protestors than any other institution in the area. We have provided OWS with meeting rooms and offices for them to assemble, plan and hold private discussions. We have provided pastoral services. We have provided a place of refuge and tranquility at our neighborhood center during open hours where they can rest, use computers, charge cell phones, and use bathrooms. Hundreds avail themselves of these facilities and services every day. It is one simple reflection of Trinity’s inherent concern for our community and for social and economic justice which has been at the heart of the church’s mission for more than 300 years. We want to be responsive, while also being responsible, to our residential and business neighbors, partners, visitors and tenants our entire community. There are no facilities at the Canal Street lot. Demanding access and vandalizing the property by a determined few OWS protesters won’t alter the fact that there are no basic elements to sustain an encampment. The health, safety and security problems posed by an encampment here, compounded by winter weather, would dwarf those experienced at Zuccotti Park. Calling this an issue of “political sanctuary” is manipulative and blind to reality. Equating the desire to seize this property with uprisings against tyranny is misguided, at best. Hyperbolic distortion drives up petition signatures, but doesn’t make it right. Those arrested were not seeking sanctuary; they were seeking to be arrested. Trinity will continue our responsible outreach and pastoral services for all. We appreciate the many expressions of support we have received from so many in the community. –The Rev. Dr. James H. Cooper.","date":"2011-12-23","mins":"5:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/18/occupy-my-local-parish-church/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Occupy my local parish church"},{"id":"comment-148298","author":"dan","post":"Whoops?

Trinity, buried in ash and debris, was closed for months. For many weeks Episcopal priests said high mass in this beautiful Catholic church, officiated sometimes by women priests. Catholic priests, a Catholic organist and other parishioners assisted. Catholic bishops from the diocese visited and on one occasion preached while a woman celebrated mass. No one was offended.

He may comment and a guest posting is always welcome from Barrie. Like I said, I’m not a lawyer. But I have had this issue explained to me by an attorney who is very familiar with copyright law. You will also notice that Wikipedia Foundation (of Wikipedia) takes this position: “The official position taken by the Wikimedia Foundation is that “faithful reproductions of two dimensional public domain works of art are public domain”. Art? A limiting word? Probably not. A bit more on the 1999 ruling by the U. S. District Court for Southern New York: The Bridgeman Art Library, a private enterprise, makes photographic reproductions of numerous works of art from museums around the world. It is their business. However, a few years ago, the Corel Corporation, a computer graphics software company, used many of Bridgeman’s reproductions to produce an educational CD ROM without seeking permission or paying Bridgeman. Bridgeman claimed copyright infringement. Not only had they purchased rights to some photographs, they had made many of them. In 1999, the U. S. District Court for Southern New York ruled against Bridgeman. The ruling stated that “exact photographic copies of public domain images could not be protected by copyright in the United States because the copies lack originality. Even if accurate reproductions require a great deal of skill, experience and effort, the key element for copyrightability under U.S. Law is that copyrighted material must show sufficient originality.” (quoted from Wikipedia) In other words, if you take a picture of an ancient mosaic, and you give me a copy or you make a copy publically available, I can use it without your permission. Is this fair? You would probably not think so if you are the photographer or someone owning a copyright claim. Bridgeman still makes copyright claims and insists that use of their photographs be licensed. Many such works today, particularly those that are licensed to commercial concerns, contains invisible or visible “digital watermarks,” to detect copying. But that is not very effective. Typical blogging software simply strips away digital watermarks and facilitates automatic cropping, resizing and corrections to contrast and color as thousands of pictures get posted every hour on the Internet. Does Bridgeman vs. Corel apply to photographs of the Shroud of Turin? Perhaps not, for it has not been determined that the shroud is a work of art. But the courts might not see it that way. The precedent established by Bridgeman vs. Corel stipulates that a photograph show sufficient originality. The more accurate the photograph the less copyrightable it is. It is often said that the courts have ruled that “sweat of the brow” (for example, the act of photographing a public domain work) is not the “creative spark” which deserves copyright. I agree with that. Colin was making a different point, altogether. I don’t know how I feel about it. Regardless, I think credit to the photographer is appropriate.

Back then, when this blog was but an experiment, I didn’t give it much attention. And then, before I learned how to manage a blog, I often cut off comments as a way to block spam; to simply have the word “dating” in a posting or comment generates countless, automatically generated spam comments. That may have been why. But I don’t remember. You can be as suspicious as you want. This blog and many sites document adequate reason to call the carbon dating I’m not going to restate them now. But let look at what I might have written to Gore (his text in bold). Exactly where is the data that discredits the Radiocarbon dating. Perhaps discredits is the wrong word. Calls into question is a better way to put it. Have other parts of the Shroud been dated for comparison. Brad knows the answer. I wish they had been (or that they will be. Is cotton vs. Linen the only “evidence”. That isn’t even a good reading of Rogers. Or Villarreal. And the answer is no, anyway. The statistical evidence that the samples are not homogenous raises serious questions. The Blue Quad Mosaic does too. Why aren’t all the subsamples documented and the raw measurements detailed for each. Why wasn’t a full chemical characterization carried out on the samples (Yes, it wasn’t part of the protocol). In other words are we still in need of information. Exactly. And what the notion of a neutron flux at the resurection…as put forward in the issue of Nature with our shroud paper. This is Red Herring. Personally, I think it is ludicrous. In fact, personally, I don’t “believe” that the Resurrection produced any energetic byproducts including light (UV too), heat, electrical, (earth, wind, fire and water, too) that created an image or rejuvenated the C14 content. There we go, now I’ve said it, and I have no words to explain why. But don’t get the idea that I think it is a fake. I don’t. Careful fellow humans for we are without the final truth and in a perfect creation we do not want to give out a dream of our own imagining as a replacement. I have no issue with that. And that is why scientists must listen to historians and philosophers. Maybe the Hungarian Pray Manuscript (just an example) begs us question scientific findings. As one of the original authors of the dating I am still waiting to see something interesting and have remained silent. I see many have a lot to say and seem to know all the secrets of the universe. Besides fragile human ego I see nothing so far. More will be revealed beyond the fragility of human nature …I pray. Is there one person here who thinks he has all the secrets? Anyone with fragile human ego? I don’t think that is a fair criticism. Be suspicious if you want, Colin. I’d be suspicious if I had removed Brad’s comment.

A chilling effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law, the decision of a court, or the threat of a lawsuit; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right (freedom of speech or otherwise) for fear of legal repercussions.” Here in the U.S. Chilling effect censorship isn’t very popular. I don’t know about the U.K. As I remind Stephen Jones, I use Fair Use principles and Fair Use law when quoting. Your blogging facility has even created a feature called Blog This to simplify quoting. So has mine, called Reblog. But go for it. You are free to try to define your own copyright rules above and beyond the provisions of the law. You may also file a complaint if you think I am going beyond fair use. You might want to read what Blogspot and Word Press have to say about this. They don’t like chilling effects censorship — nobody does except maybe repressive governments. In fact, Word Press sues and either hosting company may shut down bloggers from their own systems who file unwarranted complaints. You are free to quote me anytime. I stand by what I write. I have no problem with anyone quoting me. Here is a guidelines from the highly respected Electronic Frontier Foundation: Questions About Copyright I found something interesting on someone else’s blog. May I quote it? Yes. Short quotations will usually be fair use, not copyright infringement. The Copyright Act says that “fair use…for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” So if you are commenting on or criticizing an item someone else has posted, you have a fair use right to quote. The law favors “transformative” uses — commentary, either praise or criticism, is better than straight copying — but courts have said that even putting a piece of an existing work into a new context (such as a thumbnail in an image search engine) counts as “transformative.” The blog’s author might also have granted you even more generous rights through a Creative Commons license, so you should check for that as well. What is fair use? There are no hard and fast rules for fair use (and anyone who tells you that a set number of words or percentage of a work is “fair” is talking about guidelines, not the law). The Copyright Act sets out four factors for courts to look at (17 U.S.C. § 107): The purpose and character of the use. Transformative uses are favored over mere copying. Non commercial uses are also more likely fair. The nature of the copyrighted work. Is the original factual in nature or fiction? Published or unpublished? Creative and unpublished works get more protection under copyright, while using factual material is more often fair use. The amount and substantiality of the portion used. Copying nearly all of a work, or copying its “heart” is less likely to be fair. The effect on the market or potential market. This factor is often held to be the most important in the analysis, and it applies even if the original is given away for free. If you use the copied work in a way that substitutes for the original in the market, it’s unlikely to be a fair use; uses that serve a different audience or purpose are more likely fair. Linking to the original may also help to diminish the substitution effect. Note that criticism or parody that has the side effect of reducing a market may be fair because of its transformative character. In other words, if your criticism of a product is so powerful that people stop buying the product, that doesn’t count as having an “effect on the market for the work” under copyright law..","date":"2014-08-26","mins":"9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/25/resting-on-our-laurels/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Resting on Our Laurels"},{"id":"comment-204185","author":"dan","post":"So if I am unaware, and I remain unaware because I cannot believe it even though I’m told it, then I may be okay.

Hate is a strong word. Adding measure to it as you did (Satan), is unacceptable. Rather than editing it out, I’m pointing it out. You don’t win arguments this way.

In 1900 Ulysse Chevalier apparently had available to him a near finished Latin draft from the Troyes diocesan archives addressed to a Scribe, which would imply that the alleged memorandum was never even sent to the Scribe, let only to Anti pope Clement VII. However rather than producing this draft, Chevalier cobbled together a text from prior separate notes, which included editing marks such as marginal notes, cross outs, and substitute wording, and manufactured for it an end of 1389 date; as by its archival retention it would be clear from the near finished draft for the scribe that the memorandum had not in fact been sent to Clement. Markwardt refers to the two source documents: “In 1993, Hilda Leynen discovered that two distinct drafts of the D’Arcis Memorandum were maintained in the Champagne collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, one very rough and containing bracketed words, and the other a relatively neat and polished product.” From Chevalier’s cobbled Latin text, Herbert Thurston published an English translation in the Catholic periodical “The Month” in 1903. Wilson 1978 provides the full text of Thurston’s translation as Appendix B, the fraud apparently even escaping Wilson’s attention. The relevant text cited by Markwardt is included in his Note 6: ‘6 The memorandum refers to an alleged investigation conducted, in about 1355, by Henri de Poitiers, Bishop of Troyes. “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered the fraud and how the cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed.” ‘ Wilson makes the point that Latin lacks a definite article, and that the verb used was not “pingere” (to paint) but “depingere” (to copy). Thus the key phrase can be just as easily translated as: “… by an artist who had copied it … ” which sheds rather a different light on the whole bizarre episode. Thus relying on a questionable translation of a fraudulent memorandum may be the stuff by which art historians might make a living, but to others it may seem rather slender grounds for asserting that the origin of the Shroud image was ever an artist’s paint brush! Very likely, D’Arcis’ alleged copy assuming it existed, may have been commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original she had taken from St Stephen’s at Besancon for safe keeping and the venerable cleric was confused about the matter. The 1880 assertion that both the Besancon and Piedmont Shrouds were authentic burial cloths beggars belief, would seem to be based on no more than an excessive piety, by 1880 the French Revolution would already have deposed of the Besancon icon, the reverend gentleman would no longer have had access to it, nor would he have had access to the 1898 Pia photography..","date":"2014-11-26","mins":"6:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"id":"comment-217287","author":"dan","post":"Reblogged this on Best of Shroud Story..","date":"2015-12-27","mins":"1:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-217304","author":"dan","post":"Goodnight Mrs. Calabash wherever you are..","date":"2015-12-28","mins":"3:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-216718","author":"dan","post":"All postings and all comments associated with them will remain.

The provisions established by Pope John Paul II also allows for married or unmarried male Episcopal priests (now extended to male priests and bishops in the Church of England and the Church of Ireland). These priests may use Anglican worship traditions from the Book of Common Prayer for Mass, which acknowledges apostolic succession. But it is not important. Really! Whatever layman Henry VIII did or did not do (really, it was Elizabeth I who was important here) has no bearing on apostolic succession. Succession is by laying on of hands and cannot be nullified by laity. ‘ It is significant, too, that Benedict XVI considers ++Rowan Cantuar, namely the Most Reverend and Right Honorable Rowan Douglas Williams, to be the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury.
