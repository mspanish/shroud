It can be within a document* or on one those free photo sharing sites. Get or copy the image URL, which begins with the letters “http” and ends with “jpg”, “gif” or “png”. Type the red part exactly as you see it below (but type it in black) Paste or type the image URL shown in blue between the two red quotation marks. Img src stands for image source. The less than and greater than symbols make it into something your browser understands; same with the slash. The quotation marks are important to delimit the image URL. *Images in PDF files can be tricky, Sometimes you can extract them with the copy command (right click sort of stuff) and send them to Flickr, Facebook, etc. You can then include them in comments. I don’t know how to do that but that is why we have children. Please don’t ask for technical support above and beyond this because this is the extent of what I know about the subject..","date":"2014-04-08","mins":"8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/07/garlaschelli-and-borrini-study-flawed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Garlaschelli and Borrini Study Flawed"},{"id":"comment-40429","author":"dan","post":"Jesterof, in writing, “you are as closed minded as one can be, becaseu of your IGNORANCE,” you are getting too insulting.

To question the 1988 carbon dating is to be scientific. Did Lemaître and Hubble malign Einstein by questioning his conclusion that the universe was static? Were they wrong in doing so. The work on the shroud goes on and it should. And yes, some things done by the carbon dating labs or others involved in the testing look suspiciously like — dare we say it — pseudoscience. Well, if not that, poorly executed. To suggest, as you do, that the “sole raison d’etre of the site is to defame the people who produced the radiocarbon dating, and to do so with barely concealed innuendos and smears that stop just short of legally actionable libel” is preposterous. As for my scientific qualifications I took a chemistry class in high school and I can stir up a mean Andouille and chicken gumbo. As for your question, “So what are the special scientific insights that Episcopalians have that are denied to us ordinary mortals?”, only this: For every two Episcopalians there are three opinions (fact) and thus given enough of us there is a good chance that within a multi universe (and maybe some of them are static) one of us, somewhere, has evolved within our species, homo episcopalianis, enough so to be right..","date":"2013-10-10","mins":"5:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/08/you-guys-are-brutal/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"You guys are brutal"},{"id":"comment-46615","author":"dan","post":"ROFLMAO.","date":"2013-10-09","mins":"7:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/08/you-guys-are-brutal/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"You guys are brutal"},{"id":"comment-106469","author":"dan","post":"Max, many of your moderated comments have been deleted as they are unwarranted personal attacks on one individual.
