The abstract reads, “Abstract—This paper examines the differences between the methods of inquiry called science, metaphysics, philosophy, theology, and history in the context of investigations of the Shroud of Turin.” The paper is 1400 words in length. Unfortunately, as I read David’s cover email, he sent these only because I might be interested in them. If he gives me permission I will show the paper here. If David obtains permission from the Bari organizers I will also publish the letter of rejection.

I think Hugh Farey has very effectively summarized why. Moreover, I think that any official who controls the use of presentation venues in the Catholic Church or any church has the right to not allow you to make your presentations in those places. You may have the right to complain but I think your complaints have no merit. Why not find your own venue in a non Catholic church or secular place and make your presentations. I published your paper. What it contains is the issue if anyone wishes to discuss this. I can’t see why because it has nothing to do with the shroud. Your unhappiness with church officials is not the issue here. Unsubstantiated accusations are not welcome.

Nor do I support Craig’s assertion that Dawkins, as an Atheist, has no basis for objective moral judgment. And I do not support Dawkin’s fundamentalism of another kind, either (I subscribe to Mc Grath’s views on this). Craig’s fundamentalism is not the point. Hitchens, Harris and many other Atheists of high moral character were well aware of Craig’s somewhat strange views on a specific biblical moral dilemma. Were they less honorable for debating Craig? Were not fellow Atheists urging Dawkins to debate Craig? Could he have not used the issue of the Canaanite slaughter in debate? Of course. Should all people who debate others first consider their views on moral issues? Perhaps a scale of acceptability is needed. Should Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, perhaps not have debated Dawkins because of his Atheism or his beliefs about Christianity? Has not Dawkins said that raising children as Christians was a form of child abuse? The real point about the fist part of the posting was not about Craig’s views regarding the Canaanite slaughter as wrong. It was about the silly excuses that Dawkins gave, particularly the one in which he said he would not debate “a religious person less senior than a cardinal or a bishop.” He wasn’t standing on principle. He was standing on a self made pedestal of arrogance..","date":"2012-04-01","mins":"5:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins"},{"id":"comment-165382","author":"dan","post":"It is my understanding that the videos will be hosted on You Tube.
