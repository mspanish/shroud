I believe Barbet was honest when he reported the flexing of the thumb which is an observation, we could differ on his explanation though. As you said any nail (8mm wide) passing through the wrist would likely cause significant damage to the nerves and tendons in the wrist. This may stimulate the flexion of the thumb, Zugibe even indicated that it might be the case, but only temporarily. It is logical to think that the thumb would be paralyzed afterward due to the damage of the median nerve. It is possible that a paralysed thumb would drop into that position due to gravity on the cross, also it is possible that the people arranging the corpse for burial placed the hands with the paralyzed thumbs inwards. It is impossible to tell what exactly caused the thumbs to be kept in this position, but I think Zugibe’s exit point matches the blood stain position more than Barbet’s.","date":"2013-12-13","mins":"10:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/was-zugibe-deliberately-and-dishonestly-trying-to-mislead-his-readers/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Was Zugibe deliberately and dishonestly trying to mislead his readers?"},{"id":"comment-54414","author":"mike_morcous","post":"Amazing post.
