[{"id":"comment-69929","author":"mike_morcous","post":"I can understand why it may be claimed that the disciples stole the body ( although it is untenable because they all died for their faith in the resurrection, people don’t die for lies like this). But why would the Romans or Jewish leaders do that. It seems ultimately foolish to try to propagate the same faith they are trying to destroy by killing the leader of that faith and then stealing the body, they already knew that Jesus talked about coming back to life..","date":"2013-12-29","mins":"10:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/29/new-video-discovering-jesus-in-his-holy-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"New Video: Discovering Jesus in His Holy Shroud"},{"id":"comment-70222","author":"mike_morcous","post":"Hugh, I am Coptic orthodox myself. I find your assumption that the church would go into the effort of imprinting an image like that (pseudo negative, with 3d information, superficial at the fibre level..etc), and put real human blood with high levels of bilirubin on it for liturgical purposes absurd. A good piece of artwork with fibres that has real gold or real silver with precious stones is more likely what the Orthodox Church would do to honour a liturgical item like this..","date":"2013-12-30","mins":"3:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/29/new-video-discovering-jesus-in-his-holy-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"New Video: Discovering Jesus in His Holy Shroud"},{"id":"comment-70239","author":"mike_morcous","post":"Daveb, you are absolutely right .. Liturgy clarified scripture. The Orthodox Church uses iconography and liturgy to explain scripture to the public. I find very unlikely that they would create a burial cloth with an image that was only full appreciated after the invention of photography. The symbolism in liturgy and iconography is very clear and simple..","date":"2013-12-30","mins":"4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/29/new-video-discovering-jesus-in-his-holy-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"New Video: Discovering Jesus in His Holy Shroud"},{"id":"comment-70264","author":"mike_morcous","post":"Thanks Dave, it is a tragedy indeed, we celebrate Christmas on the 7th of January and the Christians in Egypt are expecting a bomb to go of in a church at that time. Imagine going to a church knowing that you may not survive it. However, the Coptic Orthodox Church has survived periods like that, or even much worse, in the past. I personally have left Egypt 15 years ago because I saw this coming, my parents however refuse to leave. We try to preserve the Coptic culture in our satellite communities, even here in North America. If anything history proves, persecution serves to strengthen our faith..","date":"2013-12-30","mins":"5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/29/new-video-discovering-jesus-in-his-holy-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"New Video: Discovering Jesus in His Holy Shroud"},{"id":"comment-70246","author":"mike_morcous","post":"I don’t believe in the resurrection because I believe in the shroud. My interest in the shroud is mainly because it helps me realize how much Christ suffered as a man. It gives me a chance to “Behold the man” in the 21st century.
