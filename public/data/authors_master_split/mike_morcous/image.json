[{"id":"comment-57756","author":"mike_morcous","post":"The labels are irrelevant. It is a nice Xray I found on the internet. The point I’am trying to make and has been largely ignored is this. It is clear from the overlay ( I matched the knuckles and fingers on both the shroud and the X ray) the blood stain matches Zugibe’s exit point. Barbet’s exit point is too low to match the blood stain. I hope someone else would find an X ray for a hand and can overlay it on the shroud and tell me where the error is instead of ignoring the point..","date":"2013-12-10","mins":"7:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/10/barbets-vs-zugibes-exit-points/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Barbet’s  vs   Zugibe’s Exit Points"},{"id":"comment-49827","author":"mike_morcous","post":"The scorches in the example given are way to strong to compare to the Turin Shroud, you dont really need a microscope to tell. How long do you need to expose a full body hot statue ( or bas relief) to a cloth back and forth to get the subtlety and superficiality consistent throughout the whole image of the Shroud of Turin. Without even over burning or under burning any spots. Was the blood there first? If yes why wasn’t it burned too? It doesn’t make sense to me as a viable theory to explain the shroud. Any promoter of such a theory should be able to produce a complete shroud with such a technique not a coin size scorch, then maybe he will begin to make sense..","date":"2013-11-04","mins":"12:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/should-we-be-reassessing-the-vp-8-results-continues-previous-post/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Should we be reassessing the VP-8 results (Continues Previous Post)"},{"id":"comment-49914","author":"mike_morcous","post":"Colinsberry : My interest in the Shroud image is a response to those who say it has properties that cannot be reproduced. When you look at the scant evidence for so called unique properties, you could understand many not bothering to rise to the challenge. 1 I thought Scientific interest should be with the goal of finding the truth rather than countering others?. I think, only then we may agree with others if we are wrong. Unlike in a boxing match, a good scientist may agree with the other side if the evidence leads there. 2 30 scientists from different backgrounds and faiths including Jews, agnostics..etc, spent thousands of hours studying the shroud collected thousands of data (photographs, microphotographs, chemical analysis, spectrophotometry, UV Fluorescence, x rays…etc), published 30 papers in credible peer reviewed scientific journals and came up with the conclusion that it is unique (not a work of art and cannot be explained at this time). I don’t know exactly what you mean by scant evidence. 3 Not bothering is not the word to describe why people can’t reproduce it. As you can see, a or can’t see, any credible attempt to replicate the shroud immediately attracts media attention. Lack of interest is not the true reason, The reason no body rises up to the challenge is very simple…no one can reproduce it. 4 To me, Luigi’s body image doesn’t look life like to the eye if the shroud looked like this people would have no problem refuting it. It also doesn’t match the shroud under the microscope. The blood stains look childish at best. Pigments don’t just disappear overtime, so simulating ageing by heating and then washing the cloth is not a logical sequence of events..","date":"2013-11-04","mins":"12:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/should-we-be-reassessing-the-vp-8-results-continues-previous-post/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Should we be reassessing the VP-8 results (Continues Previous Post)"}]
