I know Jesus wants everyone to know him and come to the father. I was so moved by the things the boy remembered. I am looking forward to seeing Jesus soon. I too thought the picture would match up with the Shroud, am glad to see others feel the same. Jesus is coming soon, look to Him for your salvation, He is the only way.
