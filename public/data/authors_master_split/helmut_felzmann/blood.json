Dan Porter has already given you my website address (www.shroud.info). You are perfectly right in your opinion that Jesus might have survived the crucifixion. But I am not sure whether pre and postmortem blood can really be destinquished on a chemical basis. Especially in Russia corpse blood was used for blood transfusion. Therefore there can not be much difference. But I think there are many other signs for life on the cloth. Most of the “shroud researches” are (strong) christian believers and therefore per definition biased in this point. Of course STURP examined the Shroud under the assumption of a corpse under the shroud. But I would not allege that results in favour of a living person have bin suppressed – they were just not looked for and therefore not seen: projection makes perception..","date":"2015-08-24","mins":"7:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!
