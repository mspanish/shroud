[{"id":"comment-58390","author":"michael_jude","post":"With all due respect I think most people who try and determine how the image was made, its significance, etc. Are trying too hard and looking in the wrong direction. A very good place to begin is to ask the question what, exactly IS an image? I know it sound too sophomoric but by asking this one basic question and expounding on it, e.g. How images relate to the every day human experience, biologically, physically speaking, etc. Hopefully a distinct pattern of reason can be obtained and created and draw one closer to the ultimate answer ( of course there are a plethora of other factors that will follow such as how does the idea of imagery relate to both a live body and one that is physically dead ).","date":"2013-12-12","mins":"10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/08/barbet-vs-zugibe/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Barbet vs Zugibe"}]
