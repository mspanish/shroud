This is where immaculate details and facts regarding the Shroud can be found.

(Items from the same tomb) The deeper a person goes into the research, eventuallly they will find themselves backed into a corner where only 1 possibility remains The Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus. Think of all the odd items of historical significance that people save. Sports Memorabilia, items from famous people, I cannot in my wildest imagination visualize someone actually disposing of the burial cloth of Jesus and NOT PRESERVING IT. The fact that the burial cloth of Jesus still exists should not come as a surprise, but something you would expect would be intact and preserved to this day, And it is.
