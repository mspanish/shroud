[{"id":"comment-201829","author":"david","post":"I became Christian based on entirely unexpected conversion experience from usual scientific skepticism as an adult, then became Catholic based on reading the “Apostolic” tradition of the early Church Fathers, whose experience and teaching seemed to confirm my own experience. This was furthered confirmed by early Jewish tradition of the Second Temple era about how Jews understood revelation. Paul’s experience (reported by Luke or Paul) about summarizes this as the earliest and only NT account of conversion. This is a supernatural thing. This does not persuade me one way or another about the reality of the Shroud. It simply makes me wonder about the possibilities. (I have to say that many commentators here about the Shroud have no scientific competence beyond having a degree however advanced in mostly irrelevant subjects. They are lousy engineers with a target. But they simply don’t have the data or competence. Neither do I. I wish the Vatican would allow another study, one which is more carefully considered in methodology. (I have proposed this.) I have no prejudice about the outcome and it would not change my faith, which is based on other things. No matter what the Shroud image may be, it is at least a remarkable and faithful image. I have an open mind, because first of all, I have sufficient faith already..","date":"2015-06-13","mins":"8:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/13/also-because-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Also Because of the Shroud of Turin"}]
