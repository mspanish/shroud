[{"id":"comment-33221","author":"david","post":"My idea after having seen “the real face of jesus” is this: As it was said in the film, focused beams coming upright or expandingly from the body would make the reflection fuzzy. Beam of light coming horizontally (like in scanner) is the only one which can make the image in 3 D assuming that 1. The negative of the shroud is the original image which could have been seen from the angle of THE SHROUD 2. Brightness of an scanned object depends on the distance (closeness) between an object and a scanner light, the further an object stays the darker the image is because of the dispersion of the light. I would like you to imagine the shroud as a huge scanner which did a scan of the body ITSELF and “saved the image down” on its own surface by the heat. Places which had better contact to the shroud (nose, forehead, cheeks, hair, beard, mustache) are lighter on the negative – darker on the shroud. Darker places on the negative (eyeholes) were not scorched on the shroud. The face is long and its sides are “cut” – there must have been gaps between hair and the face and the light didn’t get there or got there but the heat didn’t reflect..","date":"2013-05-08","mins":"5:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/04/a-mysterious-work-of-art/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A mysterious work of art?"}]
