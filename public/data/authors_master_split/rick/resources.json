Jesus Himself during the years of His public ministry did not care for His mother, as it would appear He is literally commanding John to do. Rather, He left her in Nazareth while He travelled through Galilee and Judaea preaching the Good News. And He would later tell John and the others that they must go forth to all nations teaching them the Good News. He did not intend that John should spend the rest of his life caring for the Blessed Virgin. Certainly, John took on responsibility for the care of Mary, but relying strictly on such a literal translation is clearly insufficient. Throughout his gospel, John speaks in symbolic terms. The synoptic gospels do not record this detail in recounting the facts of that day. No, rather, Jesus commissioned His mother to be the Mother of all Christians, and by giving her to John who personifies the Christian people, He commands us to accept her as our own mother. At least that’s how most Catholics (and I) see it……even Benedict.","date":"2015-03-12","mins":"6:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"id":"comment-193248","author":"rick","post":"Good for you sampath…but that that’s not what my Church teaches…as far as step brothers and sisters at least….but your free to interpret it as you like…..again….at fatima…Mary commented on people who question her virginity…take a look at the reasons for the 5 first saturday devotions.","date":"2015-03-12","mins":"6:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/12/here-we-go-again/","cat":"television","title":"Here We Go Again"},{"id":"comment-193249","author":"rick","post":"The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary.

The woman alluded to as being at enmity or hostility with the serpent is Mary. It was God who put this total opposition between Mary and Satan, and we believe it to be in the same likeness as Christ’s hostility with the seed of the serpent: sinful humanity. For Mary to be like Christ in His hostility with Satan and his offspring, it is reasonable to say that this passage implies Mary’s lack of sin and affinity with the devil. There is no surer way to be in total hostility with Satan than to be in the fullness of God’s constant grace (cf. Lk 1:28) and than to observe the will of God and abide by it. It was by the His grace, that God put Mary and Satan in a complete state of opposition and had the woman and the serpent become genuine enemies with hatred for each other, which the Hebrew word for enmity (eybah) denotes. Mary would be a friend of Satan if at any moment she had sinned and consequently be an unworthy mother of our Lord.
