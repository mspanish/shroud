[{"id":"comment-201249","author":"rick","post":"Colin…hope you’re not offended by the pic Dan posted….I can remember a few months back when you posted pic after pic in response to some comments…..I laughed….hilarious! However I think the problem you have with this site is that there are too many people here (with excellent knowledge) that “call you” on some of your theories. Maybe it’s better for you to go to a site where there are more like minded people, who will give you a pat and the back whether your theory make sense or not. I’m not sure if the shroud is real or not…but I do know that I’ll miss your postings..","date":"2015-06-07","mins":"1:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/07/dear-colin-berry/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Dear Colin Berry"}]
