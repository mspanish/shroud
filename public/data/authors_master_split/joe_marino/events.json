That kind of says it all, in more ways than one… “Who foots the bill for all this globetrotting” “It must be a nice little earner…” are risible comments. And to use $ in places of “s” is just disgusting. Barrie earns a very modest salary as President of STERA. His car is 19 years old. Organizations pay for his travel expenses and give an honorarium–what’s so questionable about that? That’s just standard for most speakers. Barrie says on his site it’s up to people to decide if they believe the Shroud is authentic or not. He doesn’t keep track of how many people end up deciding if the Shroud’s authentic or not. Barrie lets his board of directors vote on whether papers should be added to the site. Regarding Louis’ question about what does each member see on the Shroud, that’s an impossibly complex answer and I don’t want to speak for others. I personally have been open to different opinions about the Shroud, having published anti authenticity articles in the printed newsletter I used to do and allowing anti authenticity papers to be read at conferences in Columbus and St. Louis. With comments as cited at the beginning of this being posted, it’s no wonder some people just choose to ignore the blog..","date":"2015-09-24","mins":"6:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"id":"comment-126367","author":"joe_marino","post":"Prof. Bruno Barberis, Director of the International Center of Sindonology in Turin, will be making a presentation “Future Research on the Shroud.” There will also be a 90 minute roundtable on the subject.

John wrote, “I may be wrong about this, but I think Mark Antonacci is dismissive of the Benford Marino Rogers patch hypothesis. Therefore, one might expect that the presentations at the conference are not going to be in lock step with anyone’s particular agenda.” You are right John, Mark does not buy into the patch hypothesis. The fact that 2 committee members do have conflicting views should be an indication there is no agenda.

Regarding Charles’ comment about something coherent coming out of the conference: with about 40 speakers discussing numerous disciplines, I don’t it’s realistic to expect any coherency. One reason for the conference is just some conviviality. Regarding the tightness of the schedule, there was a similar tightness to the 2008 Columbus Ohio conference that I helped organize.

That’s not a conference. It’s a marketing exercise. Just don’t look too closely at what’s being sold, though Joe Marino’s bio gives a clue: “Both Joe and Sue performed exceptional work on researching the Shroud, and bringing its message to the world.” What a travesty. What a mockery of science.” There were so many papers that there was no time for discussion after each paper. That’s different than “no discussion was allowed.” You denigrate the conference, approximately 40 speakers and over 150 attendees (including from 7 other countries besides the United States) just because I believe the Shroud has a message.
