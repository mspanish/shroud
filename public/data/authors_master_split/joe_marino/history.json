[{"id":"comment-210899","author":"joe_marino","post":"Hi Giogio, Looking at the correspondence, he seemed to think it was 14th century. Some excerpts: “There is a more serious probability to a 14th C. Cloth, but were ‘timeless,’ being applicable also to a cloth of a defintie age between the 1st to 14 C. There is a more serious probability to a 14th C. Date, because the proof for antiquity is negative lacking in many possible materials, while assorted proofs of ‘authenticity’ are either now invalidated or still unresolved and inconclusive, like the Frei Pollen, and the textile facts are not ancient but medieval.” “…I believe my position, from the artist or craft subject, along with the STURP tests, is a much better scenario for a 14th C. Turin Shroud as a medieval textile.” “…there is no evidence of any looms to weave 3/1twills in linen of th 1st C. – or examples of regular or herringbone twills 3/1 in any linens before the 7th C. AD. And we dont’ have to cite any further timeframe for such herringbone twills in linen, until the 14th mid 18th C. In European countries. Those are products of the treadle loom of four shafts with pedals, which is an advance loom of the Early to Late Renaissance–only in European linens, 15 of them. According to Pr. Gabrial Vial’s textile analysis of 1988 on the Turin Shroud, during the C 14 cuttings, that imaged cloth was woven on a treadle loom of pedals & four shafts which confines that linen to a post 14th C. Timeframe. (P.13, Spectrum #38/39, 1991.) Thus, it is impossible to date the Turin Shroud to a period before the 14th C. – and certainly not before 1201 AD, to a spiceladen Gospel Shroud at Constantinople, (P. 167 8, Wilson, Shroud, 1979, NY).” (Donnelly died April 3, 1988 per a letter from his wife.).","date":"2015-09-21","mins":"8:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/21/another-overwhelming-evidence-argument/","cat":"history","title":"Another Overwhelming Evidence Argument?"},{"id":"comment-40455","author":"joe_marino","post":"This blog could help its cause by spelling “archaeology” correctly, instead of “archeology.”.","date":"2013-08-04","mins":"9:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/01/bible-archeology-the-mystery-continues/","cat":"history","title":"Bible Archeology: The mystery continues"},{"id":"comment-130078","author":"joe_marino","post":"The papers will eventually be on a separate site from the conference site.
