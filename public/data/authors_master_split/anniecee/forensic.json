[{"id":"comment-5865","author":"anniecee","post":"I like Yannick Clément’s “triple amen.” :) And I like Dr. Peter Mullen’s “unsatisfactory faith.” That is a good challenge, a wonderful challenge. It strikes a note with me, I think this has been bothering me for days and it’s refreshing to hear it. Yes, I need to strive for better faith. We need to strive for better faith. And those who insist on substantial proof need to get on their knees and get busy with God while they are still able. Because there will come a time when it’s too late to acquire faith. I googled for the phrase “God of the Gaps” and discovered that’s an actual term. I assumed it meant that people refuse to believe in God until all the gaps are filled (or all the dots connected.) But actually, “God of the Gaps” refers to the idea that anything which cannot be explained is assumed to be supernatural. I think the term is a little bit obscure. And, I think it’s a false observation most likely coined by people outside the faith. They don’t understand how we think, as Christians. The implication is that Christians are over eager to label something as supernatural when it might not be. There are some impulsive people who may think like this but I believe most Christians are not so simple minded. We are intrigued that the Shroud MIGHT have been created by supernatural means but that doesn’t mean it was, and I think most people know the difference. Anyway… I think Dr. Mullen’s statement is related to this issue. True faith is able to accept that our knowledge is and always will be incomplete, until we see God face to face. Incomplete knowledge is an opportunity to **trust** God for what we don’t know, an opportunity to exercise faith. This is “satisfactory faith.” It is pleasing to God..","date":"2011-12-21","mins":"9:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/21/an-unsatisfactory-faith-insists-upon-forensic-proofs/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An unsatisfactory faith insists upon forensic proofs"}]
