I spent some time in an Atheist forum, several months. I got something out of it but I don’t think they got a blame thing. I do think the Lord gave me wisdom because there were times I really did have control of the conversation – not that my goal was “control”, that’s not it at all. But I tried to stop their circular way of discussing things and sometimes I could do that but ONLY if I didn’t play the game THEIR WAY. They like to force their “victims” to run in circles. They don’t EVER like to come to conclusions, they just like to throw questions at you rapid fire to keep you spinning in circles. I learned that they tend to get crazy if you talk about Noah’s Ark. I wondered why that set them off because it really did. I figure it’s because Noah’s Ark is a story of God’s judgment on mankind, and the devil doesn’t like to be reminded of what’s in store for him. Judgment is inevitable. There’s plenty of evidence of the Flood, lots and lots of it. The flood is probably what throws off Carbon dating because they don’t factor that in. That’s my opinion on it anyway because I think their dates are screwy. It jumps from 10,000 years to millions and billions – with hardly anything in between. In other words, carbon dating gets really weird if they try to go back before the flood happened and so I think they left the flood out of their algorithms. They refuse to talk about angels. Even though there’s an endless supply of stories from people who have met and talked with angels or had angels save their life. They won’t go there. An angel saved MY life one time, maybe more than that. I’ve seen a few genuine for real documented miracles. But of course they mock all of it. Even the PROOF is not good enough for them, the idiots. Jesus told the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus the beggar. They both died. The rich man in hell begged Abraham to send Lazarus to warn his brothers. Abraham said it was not possible, and besides, they already had the prophets to warn them and if that wasn’t enough then nothing else would work either. WHAT THIS STORY IS SAYING IS THIS: The TESTIMONY of the Saints is all the PROOF that the Living are going to get! That, and creation itself are enough to convince anybody and if it isn’t, then that person is a lost cause. SO the lesson to be learned is this: YOUR TESTIMONY is a priceless gift and should be respected when sharing it with others. Most of the time with these loud mouth atheists it’s like throwing pearls before swine, but that doesn’t mean the pearls (your testimony) are worthless. It just says something about the swine who are supposedly intelligent but they actually know nothing. And like Ron says, they fart a lot. I’m very amused that the Shroud of Turin provokes them. Makes me happy to know they can’t find any peace as long as the Shroud exists. They don’t deserve peace, with all the blasphemies that come of them. I don’t wish damnation for them: I believe the best “revenge” is repentance. There is very little that gives me true joy, but watching someone get serious about God is one thing that really makes me happy and glad for them. This is what I wish for everyone..","date":"2012-03-29","mins":"6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/25/a-guest-posting-by-jabba-rich-savage/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by “Jabba” (Rich Savage)"},{"id":"comment-9799","author":"anniecee","post":"Hi Rich, well you are willing to go where no man dares to go.

They change topics constantly. They aren’t willing to actually DISCUSS anything. This shows their blatant dishonesty, in my opinion. You may learn some things by debating them, but it would be a miracle if they learned anything from you – because most of them aren’t interested in knowing the truth. Still, if this is what God wants you to do for now it may be worthwhile. It will certainly sharpen your own debate skills and increase your own understanding of the points involved. One thing they can’t handle is anything supernatural. And yet the evidence collected so far about the Shroud indicates that something supernatural most likely DID happen in order to imprint the image on the cloth. Maybe you can’t exactly prove it, but they can’t disprove it either. However, they are not content to leave that alone, which is why the Shroud nags at them. And explains why people are able to sell ridiculous books that (attempt) to discredit the Shroud. The Shroud is about Jesus Christ, first of all. If it is really the Shroud of Christ, then the real power in the Shroud is the story of Christ’s Passion. The whole story is THERE, a flannelgraph lesson of what Christ did for us..","date":"2012-03-26","mins":"4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/25/a-guest-posting-by-jabba-rich-savage/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by “Jabba” (Rich Savage)"},{"id":"comment-9655","author":"anniecee","post":"They don’t know how blessed they are to HAVE you, it’s a very tough mission field and you’re brave to try it.

Someone who came to their senses and realized, “Oh my goodness, what if God is REAL?” We were listening to the “Touching Point” program yesterday (Dr. David Jeremiah’s church program.) The music in that church is so fabulous. I don’t understand how anyone can resist the music of Christianity, or why they would choose any other religion if they knew what a great time Christians have with their celebrations. Christmas music is so awesome. And Easter music is just as good. Perhaps Peace did not come to earth (yet) when Christ was born in Bethlehem, but I do think there is a peace that settles over any person or group or crowd when “Silent Night” is played. That song has even been known to bring peace on the battlefield. So I don’t understand how people can be so resistant about turning to God.

He is definitely hanging out with the wrong crowd! Sounds as if his associates aren’t any better than the Atheists. “And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.” Hebrews 11:6 If you believe in God, you must also believe in the Afterlife and the Rewards that come with it. If we believe in a SPIRITUAL EXISTANCE, which is where God lives, then we also believe that we ARE and WILL BE there with God some day. We’re much more a part of that existance even now than we fully realize. We’re right in the middle of it. It surrounds us. The problem with the Math brain types is they can only see the what their eyeballs see. But there are plenty, PLENTY of other personality types who are not so concrete and are able to perceive more without even trying. I feel really sorry for the Math brains. And I do think they could do a MUCH better job of being intuitive if they wanted to. I really wonder why this guy went into the ministry. This is appalling. Absolutely appalling. I’ve heard that the seminaries are full of people who don’t believe in God, and I think that’s true but why in the world are they teaching in SEMINARIES then?? Seems as if they are the very tool of the devil himself. And if you look at it THAT way: there is more “proof” for you. Of course the devil wants to put evil seed in the very seat of theological education: what a brilliant move on the part of the vile serpent who is the Enemy of God. COURAGE?? It takes COURAGE to believe in the afterlife??? This Reverend really needs to apologize to God, IMO. And he should start looking for men of Faith to be his friends.

Jesus is frustrated because he can’t MOVE them to care about anything. Their prosperity has made them deaf and dumb, unable to have compassion for others and unable to care about their own spiritual development. Jesus begs them to pray for spiritual help for themselves! Laodicea is the final church in the list of churches. It seems to describe the current condition of not only the Church but also of society itself. I have become aware of this because I’m trying to help a small orphanage in Haiti, with which I have direct connections. I can’t find anybody to give a darn about these kids. It wasn’t like this when I was growing up; society was much more caring back in the 1960’s in my opinion. I think the changes are very distressing. I’m especially disappointed in my own family who completely ignore my reports of progress on the kids. My experience with trying to help this orphanage makes me more aware of how absolutely COLD people have become. This attitude can be analyzed in many different ways and there are some valid reasons for some of the cynicism, but it doesn’t excuse us in God’s eyes for catering to our own pleasures constantly rather than show a little compassion when the opportunity presents itself. Christians will be judge for their compassion, so if we want to lay up treasures for ourselves in heaven this is what we need to be doing. The “So What” attitude is prevalent in secular AND Christian society and it’s very alarming, in my opinion..","date":"2012-01-06","mins":"12:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/06/and-so-is-the-shroud-of-turin-another-so-what/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"And so, is the Shroud of Turin another “So What?”"},{"id":"comment-6600","author":"anniecee","post":"And I disagree with the Right Rev.

If “science” has already DETERMINED the outcome or results of the research … then that is some really bad science. These skeptics say the word “science” as if it actually means something. They indicate that “Science” has the only true answers. “Science” is the only objective source of knowledge. Well, if “Science” is deliberately BIASED in its perspective, then I would say that such “Science” is completely worthless. And yet, this guy is willing to place the worth of his eternal soul on such wobbly foundations as Science with an Agenda? Science is bad enough even when it DOESN’T have an agenda!! Fifty years ago “Science” told us all to eat oleomargarine because butter was bad for us. Recently they determined that oleo might be worse than butter because it has “bad” cholesterols and butter has “good” cholesterols. Thank goodness I never gave up butter, it would have been 50 years wasted. They also told us that chocolate and coffee were bad for us but have recently decided otherwise. Thank goodness I’m committed to my evil vices… which it turns out were not so evil after all. In fact, it might even be healthy to eat chocolate, drink coffee and smear real butter on my bread… in moderation. Obviously Science does not know everything, and to depend entirely on the wisdom of Science is, well, it’s a little astonishing. The skeptics hold up Science as if it’s the ultimate virtue, but it doesn’t even take close inspection or analysis to know that the wisdom such Skeptics rely on is all an enormous crutch or diversion. They use it to skitter away from facing the real Truth. The poor, sorry Skeptics have no idea how foolish they sound to people who know their God and walk with Him every day. I am alarmed for their future, I can actually see them cowering before God’s wrath someday and I wish I could turn them from it — but there seems to be very little we can say or do that will make a difference. For one thing, they lack honesty. I’ve heard of a few who HONESTLY dug into research and learned some things. One guy was intent on discrediting the Resurrection of Christ and set out to prove it never happened. Instead, he became impressed by the fact that every one of the 11 disciples who knew Christ during His ministry suffered hideous tortures: and all but one died as martyrs. He concluded that the original Disciples really DID believe the things they were saying, to the point that they were willing to die for the Truth they preached. So he ended up turning to Christ as his Savior, too. And recently I read about a guy (here on this blog somewhere) who was convinced of the reality of Christ because of his study of the Shroud, which he initially believed was a fake. This is good news, it is very encouraging.

When the Rich Man found himself in a place of suffering, he begged Abraham to send Lazarus back and warn his brothers. Abraham told him that, for one thing, it wasn’t even possible to do send Lazarus back. But even if it was possible to send Lazarus back, it wouldn’t make a difference. Abraham told the Rich Man that his brothers had plenty of evidence already and if they wouldn’t believe the witness of the prophets, then they wouldn’t be convinced by anybody even if they saw Lazarus raised from the dead. So that’s the story Jesus told, and it directly addresses issues of faith, from the point of view of the afterlife. Apparently the witness of those who DO believe is considered very valuable in the eyes of Heaven. If people on earth insist on rejecting the witness of believers, they will have no excuse when they stand before God. So this should encourage Christian believers, at any rate. Your testimony is a powerful thing: what God has done for you is important. Don’t feel hurt when people belittle it. That Rich Man in hell certainly regretted his callousness, but there was nothing he could do about it by then. One thing I have always enjoyed is listening to others tell the story of how they got saved: the steps that lead them there to that point. I am always touched by the sincerity, the tenderness, the love of God that comes through. I think Atheists and Agnostics should spend less time scoffing and mocking, and more time listening. Blind faith is a very inaccurate term. Perhaps it appears to be “blind” for those who haven’t tried it but it’s anything but “blind” for true Christian believers.

Supernatural things happened all the time around Jesus Christ. It’s more LIKELY that the Shroud has a supernatural explanation, than not. Jesus could not do many miracles in Galilee because the people had little faith. Lack of faith is disappointing to Jesus and to God the Father. The more faith, the more likely that prayers will be answered and supernatural things might happen. Supernatural or Divine assistance is far more common than people realize. So… I think the scoffers and the skeptics and the doubters can continue to drive themselves crazy looking for a “natural” explanation, but considering that the Shroud of Christ (if it’s real) was and is directly connected to the supernatural event known as the Resurrection, I highly doubt there will EVER be a natural explanation for that Shroud.

Fun to read. I noticed a trend: it seems that things which cannot be explained are dismissed by “experts” as being a hoax. Why is it so hard to just leave something as “unexplained.” Or “not confirmed.” I enjoy the mystery. Some of those artifacts hint at extra terrestial life. How fun is that?? I’m not someone who looks for UFO’s and I don’t collect books or belong to clubs. Not interested in getting silly about it… but I do think that if God wanted to put humanoid creatures on other planets He certainly could and can do whatever He wants to do. It might explain why the planets are so unbelievably far apart: so we don’t corrupt other inhabited planets or influence them. I don’t think the human race would be good for any other “peoples” that might be out there. But there’s no way of knowing what God might have done elsewhere. He’s not saying..","date":"2011-11-12","mins":"1:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/12/the-shroud-of-turin-is-number-one-on-this-list/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin is Number One on This List"},{"id":"comment-6007","author":"anniecee","post":"Maybe not trying to be sneaky… it appears to me to be an honest effort to tweak the article for accuracy. I don’t think it’s fair to assign motive to Mr. Chivers because we don’t really know WHY he did it. There may have been noble intentions in revising the article, and at least he DOES mention that he has revised it. I think it’s amusing that some news agencies have announced there is proof that the Shroud was produced by supernatural means. That oughta drive the skeptics out of their minds. And for all we know, it may be the truth. Maybe God is in this more than you know. Especially if it’s His Shroud. :D Besides, it’s very typical of UK news media to exaggerate things for sensationalism. Even worse than the USA news media, apparently. This was quite predictable. Perhaps there is Divine method behind this madness. At least people are talking about the Shroud and that’s probably a good thing..","date":"2011-12-23","mins":"4:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/23/tilt-tom-chivers-sneaks-in-a-correction/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Tilt: Tom Chivers Sneaks in a Correction"},{"id":"comment-4852","author":"anniecee","post":"Yes, I know what you mean about how it hurts the heart.

As the Bible says, “In professing to become wise they have become fools.” Anyone who has actually worked at being a Christian and KNOWING Christ in personal salvation and relationship knows how wrong these blasphemers are. But they can’t be convinced, and one of the main reasons is because they forcefully reject the testimony of believers. It was quite a revelation for me when I read the story Jesus told about a beggar and a rich man. The rich man in hell begged Abraham to send Lazarus back to warn his brothers on earth of the judgment to come: but Abraham told him that the brothers have the testimony of the prophets. And if that’s not enough for them, nothing is. There is enough evidence of God, right here. Nature itself speaks of the glory, care, compassion and glory of God. In addition, there is the testimony of those who love God and know Him. If these things are not enough, then Jesus HIMSELF said (through the parable) that nothing else will do it. For one thing, this gives confidence to those who believe in Jesus. Our testimony is not a little thing, in fact: the testimony of believers is everything. It is the testimony of believers that has caused Christianity to endure against all odds. This is amazing power, when you read the history of the church. I’ve been reading the Seventh Day Adventist histories by Ellen White: I don’t agree with their legalism, I’d be reluctant to join the SDA: but she did write some fascinating books on church history. Anyway… the blasphemers will not be stopped even though they walk on very dangerous ground. They heat up their own punishment with their relentless mockery, I am truly concerned for them and I wish I could put some sense in their heads. But I also figure this is another symptom of the end times, and so I am learning to look up when all these distressing things happen around the world. The rise of atheism is just another symptom, and if this is the way it has to be until the Lord Returns, then let it heat up. The sooner Jesus returns, the better. The Bible does say that God will speed things up toward the end (shorten the days or hasten the days), so I think we’re on a roller coaster ride now. Sure feels like it..","date":"2011-11-16","mins":"12:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/16/tis-the-season-of-anti-christmas-billboards/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Tis the Season of Anti-Christmas Billboards"},{"id":"comment-4232","author":"anniecee","post":"Oh, that would be nice. I have plans for the day but if they get interrupted by heavenly trumpets and the second coming of Jesus, I really will not complain. That would definitely make my day!! :) Actually, the people who study prophecy say that Jesus could return during the Feast of Tabernacles, which is going on now (Jewish holiday.) And there are a lot of people who think this year is a significant year. Harold Camping is not the only one who pointed to this week as a possibility for the return of Christ, or the Rapture, or both. But Camping is the only one who keeps setting dates and announcing them as if he knows something.

Controlled participation is more likely to end up with a very intelligent and indepth discussion, with a Full Presentation of ideas from both sides.

I think the Scots have St. Andrews’ fingers somewhere. And, there’s the “Stone of Destiny”, believed to be the stone that Jacob slept on when he had the vision of a ladder to heaven. The Stone is or was in Westminster Abbey, but I believe it was returned to the Scots and will be borrowed for future coronations. There’s a lot of doubts about the Stone but it’s still an important part of English culture. All these relics have a fascinating history, some of it entirely fabricated – but others might be based on truth. And people don’t really care anymore if the relic is real or not, the legend itself has become part of their culture and identity, so why mess with it. The Seventh Day Adventists have a story that one of their own found the Ark of the Covenant. The stories and legends surrounding the Ark are incredible: I think every continent claims to have it hidden somewhere. I’ve come across some legends that are quite extensive and elaborate, and yet they turn out to be fake. British Israel had a very elaborate (fake) story about Tea Tephi, and some people are still completely convinced the Ark is in Ireland. But the most amazing story of all is by a Seventh Day Adventist explorer, a very devout man, who claims to have found it and brought back a fuzzy picture of it. The story is compelling, I haven’t decided yet what to make of it, but I’ve corresponded some with the guy who ran the Explorer’s museum and Pinkowski is so convinced of what his friend found, that I’ve bounced it around my head quite a bit lately. The Explorer, Ron Wyatt, is not without credibility: he did find the authentic for real Mount Sinai in Saudi Arabia and there’s a documentary or movie about it that will be out soon. Ron Wyatt, died in 1999. But he claimed to have found Sodom and Gomorroh (fascinating story) and the place where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea: a movie documentary has been made about this as well, and is supposed to be released soon. I’m not saying I believe it, about the Ark: this is the most astonishing story of all. I do find it to be very interesting, especially since people who knew Mr. Wyatt are staunch defenders of his character. There are a number of websites that mention Ron Wyatt: http://www.wyattarchaeology.com/ http://pinkoski.com/ http://www.wyattmuseum.com/ http://jonah135588.wordpress.com/2008/10/22/deathbed confession of ron wyatt discoverer of the ark of the covenant/ BTW, I think that toy from Raiders of the Lost Ark is disgusting.

Ron Wyatt found the huge rock nearby, too. So all of this is directly connected with the Shroud of Turin, and equally as mysterious.
