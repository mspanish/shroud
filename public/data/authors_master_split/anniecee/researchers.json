So, his take is that the Shroud is real but the Resurrection isn’t? Yes, that will go over very well with the anti Shroudies. The Shroud becomes the mechanism that confused all those poor dumb disciples into thinking they saw a ghost. There’s definitely something laughable about that. Yes, the Eureka Moment could very well become a Bestseller, most likely. After all, it’s written by a Cambridge professor who did his “research.” Research… The Gnostics? They were discredited long ago. In fact, the mainstream Christian church had to clarify many doctrines in order to combat the heresy. Obviously the Eureka Moment is not aimed at mainstream Christians. Acts of Thomas? I can see why he likes Thomas, the doubting apostle. But I read an article recently on the National Geographic website (of all places) that explained Thomas’ ministry. Thomas was a very diligent and powerful Evangelist after the Ascension of Christ. Thomas did not suffer from any more doubts, in fact he is known for miraculous signs and wonders. They believe Thomas traveled more and farther than Paul did. Thomas likely had nothing to do with the Book of Thomas, he traveled way way off to India and died there as a martyr..","date":"2012-03-26","mins":"8:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/26/get-thee-upset-or-not-thomas-de-wesselows-new-book-on-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Get Thee Upset!

And these are the people who TEACH the next Generation? Toxic. TOXIC! Why can’t the Shroud simply be, as de Wesselow says: an intellectual puzzle? Which it certainly is! The Shroud has people around the globe baffled and puzzled and even bent out of shape. I think somebody could write a book on the psychological impact of the Shroud, because it is obvious there is something about the Shroud that gets people’s nerves all twangled. And why should that BE, I wonder?? Unless…. There really IS a God and He is deliberately trying to goad people into spiritual awareness? If people could set aside their resistance to God and religion, they would see how stupid they are. I’m glad de Wesselow was able to wise up. That’s very encouraging, I have considerable respect for his honesty..","date":"2012-03-25","mins":"11:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/25/telegraph-article-on-cambridge-shroudie-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","title":"Telegraph article on Cambridge Shroudie Thomas de Wesselow"},{"id":"comment-9651","author":"anniecee","post":"Angry that the Shroud is HERE? I suppose that is a very strong indication that it truly IS the Sign of Jonah for this generation. I’ve forgotten now who said that… Oh yes, Dr. Peppler. I was so impressed with his statement, I actually wrote it in notes. Dr. Peppler quotes this verse, which is a perfect description of society now, “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.” Mat 16:4 Jesus himself said it. And it’s scary to read it, especially in connection with the Shroud. I think Dr. Peppler was incredibly on target with that observation..","date":"2012-03-26","mins":"3:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/25/telegraph-article-on-cambridge-shroudie-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","title":"Telegraph article on Cambridge Shroudie Thomas de Wesselow"}]
