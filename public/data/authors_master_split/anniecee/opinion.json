[{"id":"comment-5614","author":"anniecee","post":"An avowed atheist… that hurts, doesn’t it. Unbelievers don’t know the frustration that Christians feel, knowing how different it could have been. The Bible says, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.” This verse makes me think that God Himself is on the other side of the chasm, waiting and anticipating each precious soul when it’s their time to die. He wants to see this transition for Himself, and be the first to welcome His spiritual children. People who have had near death experiences often say that Jesus is there to meet them. What a relief to know this! But… what if God wasn’t waiting for me? In fact, what if nobody was there. They say that hell is the absence of God. What if I died and I found myself unbelievably ALONE. And none of the comforts that God has so lavishly provided on this earth to provide for every need? I don’t know if the typical description of hell is accurate. Some people say that the demons will torment us. How can that be right, when the demons will share in the same punishment that we do? I wonder if each will suffer in torment alone, and without comfort, until the spiritual light goes out. Jesus said, “Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.” Spiritual death must be a far worse process than the kind of death we experience in our own flesh. Atheists want to believe that death is merely sleep and annihilation, but the Bible makes it clear that it’s not that easy. Not by any means.

Amazing. Wikipedia has this to say about Christopher Hitchens: Identified as a champion of the “New Atheism” movement, Hitchens described himself as an antitheist and a believer in the philosophical values of the Enlightenment. Hitchens said that a person “could be an atheist and wish that belief in god were correct,” but that “an antitheist, a term I’m trying to get into circulation, is someone who is relieved that there’s no evidence for such an assertion.”[17] He argued that the concept of god or a supreme being is a totalitarian belief that destroys individual freedom, and that free expression and scientific discovery should replace religion as a means of teaching ethics and defining human civilization. He wrote at length on atheism and the nature of religion in his 2007 book God Is Not Great. — I can’t help but wonder if Mr. Hitchens would like to add another chapter to his book, now..","date":"2011-12-16","mins":"10:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/16/rip-christopher-hitchens/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"RIP Christopher Hitchens"},{"id":"comment-3712","author":"anniecee","post":"Jesus said, “I would that you were hot or cold, but because you’re lukewarm I will spit you out of my mouth.” At least we completely know where the “New Atheists” stand. I don’t think the Atheists are much different from the New Atheists in their basic beliefs: it’s just that the New Atheists are more confrontational or Evangelical. Possibly the “regular” Atheists were fooling themselves. Their views ARE extreme, it’s just that they didn’t want to create waves so they stayed low key in promoting their philosophies. The New Atheists are not shy, they’re out and about, loud and clear. They’re obnoxious, they know it and they love it. So are the satanists, they’re coming out of the closet now as well. Lots of fringe groups are showing up, showing off and PROUD of their anti Christian behaviors and beliefs. According to Jesus’ own words, He would rather have it this way. The gray areas of morality are disappearing. People are polarized in their beliefs. This is GOOD because it leaves far less room for hypocrites who want to play it both ways. Atheists: you wanted an anti God society and you’re getting it. Just see what good it’s going to do this world, without the moral constraints of Jesus’ teachings (AND the influence of the Holy Spirit) to keep mankind’s impulses in check. Things are already getting very interesting, and it’s because the self sacrificing nature of a Christian culture is disappearing quickly. It all began with the rebellions of the 1960’s. The hippies raised their kids with the new moralities, and those kids are raising their children with even newer moralities. Each generation grows up to be totally selfish and self centered, in addition to being increasingly more violent. The Atheists don’t have alternative moralities to offer these kids. The only suggestion they have is to continue to reject whatever God might have to say about anything.

Lewis’s “Mere Christianity” or that book by M. Scott Peck about “The Road Less Traveled” which was a bestseller in the late 70’s, 80’s. In fact, this Andrew Sullivan seems to have similar views as Peck. Overall, how would you summarize Andrew Sullivan? I’m not familiar with him. That’s rather deep theology that he’s wading around in. And, I think he has complicated it by mixing the Catholicism in with it. OF COURSE the Catholics do not understand salvation by pure Grace, Mercy and Love: they have made a lot of money on all their requirements for Works. The Catholics are not alone in that, I think every church organization imposes a system of requirements that help to bind their followers in commitment to the church. And in some ways that is good, but the understanding of God’s love becomes all the more difficult to grasp. I think, due to our own innate selfishness, it’s almost impossible for us to grasp God’s kind of love anyway. One thing that I believe is MISSING from Andrew Sullivan’s summary: all our efforts to explain God are like trying to explain the tip of the iceberg. Whatever little bit we understand about Jesus Christ: he is much MUCH more in His own realm. Whatever little bit we understand about heaven and eternity: it is all soooo much more glorious than we can imagine. The teensy bit that we understand about real LOVE is only a tiny drop in an enormous bucket. And ALL of it is much nearer, closer than we think. In the next five minutes we could all drop dead for some reason or other, and there we’d be with God (for better or worse)!! Just like that it could happen, so I don’t think God is as distant as we think He is. I’m afraid that all our fine, complicated theological arguments tend to lose the “magic”, although that’s definitely the wrong word for it but what other word can we use that people would understand easily? I think the appropriate word is most likely: GLORY. The glory of God.

And so the question I have about Andrew Sullivan is this: does he believe in judgment & punishment or doesn’t he? Does he think that God’s love covers everybody? That the love of Christ covers all peoples and all religions? This is where he seems to be vague, at least in this article. If it were true that Jesus love covers all, then the New Testament would not mention judgment or punishment – after the death of Christ. But the NT most certainly does speak of God’s judgment, and the coming wrath in many places all the way to the end of the Bible. The book of Revelation written by the Apostle John himself, is all about coming doom. If God’s love means that everyone gets to heaven, then Jesus didn’t need to die on the cross for our salvation. And if the only thing the Cross meant was a symbol of how much God loves us, then I think God could have chosen a symbol that was not so horrific. The Shroud, if it means anything, is about the terrible death Jesus died. It is a symbol that tells us: Sin is real and so are judgment and punishment. It is also about resurrection Life: the Life that we can have when we accept Jesus in our hearts. I honestly don’t know how God is going to work things out on Judgment Day but I know that He does all things well, and it will be fair. It is our task to respond to the gospel, not to worry about how judgment will pan out. If we have heard the gospel of Jesus Christ, then we need to embrace it with repentance and commitment..","date":"2011-11-18","mins":"12:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/17/andrew-sullivan-on-what-is-god/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Andrew Sullivan on What Is God?"},{"id":"comment-4862","author":"anniecee","post":"I’ve been reading it again… yes, I like it very much.

I’ve noticed they have no real desire for learning anything and it’s obvious their presence on chat threads is not about learning Truth. It appears to me that they really like to swagger and bully others. I’ve also had some conversations with possibly “real” athiests who are more mature and more educated but after a number of indepth conversations I don’t think their philosophies and questions are a genuine, honest search for truth either. They want to skitter around some topics, there are some things you cannot force them to address. Such as whether there are real, supernatural phenomena (such as sightings of angels.) And if the supernatural exists then WHY do athiests demand proof of what is supernatural on their own terms? Maybe, if they’re really interested in knowing what’s behind the countless stories of supernatural experiences, they need to create a different set of criteria than what they use for exploring the Natural world. I think of it as aliens studying aliens. If we went to Mars and actually found little humanoid beings on that planet, would we insist that they learn things OUR way?? Or would we make an effort to learn about them in THEIR terms, in THEIR environment? If the supernatural is somewhere on a different plane than our own human experience, then we need to learn about THAT plane in order to learn what’s there and how it works. And it’s not unreasonable to suggest that there are other planes of experience: science already suspects it. Another thing athiests go berserk over is the topic of Noah’s flood. To me this is almost humorous, if you want to set off a roomful of athiests then just casually mention the Flood and it pretty much doesn’t matter what you say about it, the place will be hoppin’ with athiests having temper tantrums. Why does this matter SOOOO much, I wonder?? It’s my own theory that they hate the story because it’s a story of God’s judgment.

Ordinarily I’m a good speller so thanks. Jesus told a story about a rich man, I’m sure Kyle knows the story. How the rich man ignored the poor beggar at his door, but when they both died, the rich man went to a place of suffering and Lazarus was comforted in the bosom of Abraham. The rich man begged Abraham to send someone back to warn his brothers. Abraham said it wouldn’t do any good. Abraham said there was plenty back there to warn anybody who was willing to listen, and the rich man’s brothers wouldn’t have any excuse when they died. There’s quite a bit in this thread for anybody who is truly searching, so I think Kyle is skipping right over the good stuff. And I’m a little worried about that actually. It didn’t turn out so well for the rich man and his brothers, when they did that. Kyle says there’s No proof of the supernatural. Well, I’ll address that one. Here are some documented miracles that I have personally seen: A cafeteria full of people were fed 100 hot dogs and there were 97 left over. The packages were hauled out of the garbage and counted and recounted, there were multiple witnesses and it was very thoroughly observed by many people who were there. This was a classic “Loaves & Fishes” miracle at a church camp. The three cooks in the kitchen were afraid there wasn’t enough food to go around, especially when even more people showed up than expected. So the three cooks prayed. There were more than three people who knew about it after lunch was over, and helped do all the counting. I was there, too, watching them doublecheck everything. My mother was one of the cooks. There were 75 people at lunch, they all had hot dogs and three people had two hot dogs. We figured that was why there were 97 leftover… Free gas. We were driving to visit my grandparents and it was the middle of the night and we were in the middle of nowhere with a station wagon, five kids and two adults (my parents.) The gas tank had been on E for a very long long time. My folks prayed of course. Finally they saw a gas station that was open. They pulled in. The owner was there, filling up his boat so he could go fishing – but he let my folks buy gas. That in itself could be considered a miraculous coincidence, but my folks put two or three gallons more in the gas tank than it could hold. If it was a 15 gallon tank, then they put in more than 17 gallons. My Dad knew how much that tank could hold. My folks figured God had given them some gas on loan, God’s sense of humor. You can dismiss these things easily just by saying “Where’s the Proof?” But they happened and there was no doubt about it. In fact, my folks got in trouble with their church for sharing about the gas tank episode and had to go to another church after that because people didn’t think God still did miracles.

As long as athiests refuse to keep an open mind about the existance of the supernatural, they will know absolutely nothing. God left us a trail of clues. In the Bible God says, “Those who come to God must believe that He is, and that He rewards those who diligently seek Him.” So God is giving an invitation here, but He makes it clear that in order to learn what He’s got to offer, you must do it on H Is terms and in His “space” so to speak. The leap of faith is actually a very simple matter, therefore: it’s a willingness to go to God on H Is terms. If God is truly God, He is not being unreasonable in requiring this. But why does He do it this way, instead of coming into the Natural World and giving off displays of all his amazing powers? Why doesn’t He provide proof on demand? I think it’s because He’s looking for something among mankind. For one thing, God doesn’t want a lot of rebels, which I think is what athiests basically are because of their blasphemies. If there is no God, then what’s the purpose of deliberately insulting Him? To me, a true athiest would be above that. A true athiest would not be concerned about God at all, ever. But nobody talks about God more than the athiests, I think. So this guy is right that athiests have become very evangelical. It’s an anti God campaign, and it’s very ugly. They say a lot of very negative things against God and anyone who believes. They love doing it, apparently it FEELS GOOD doing it, so they do more of it.

For me, working through doubts has led to greater understanding of God and His ways. Athiests want to bog down the conversation with so many questions that there’s no way to finish a discussion. Mass confusion is a favorite tactic: throw in a whole pile of questions for every 1 statement that the “opponent” makes. Changing the subject is a favorite tactic: switch to something else and something else and something else with each comeback. This is why I totally question the honesty of any athiest I’ve talked to. How honest do you think YOU are? I’m very busy this week and I truly don’t have time to play such games, which I think would not get us anywhere anyway. Like Jesus said, it was all about knowing His Father. He said this over and over: it was the core of His message. He wants us to know His Father. You think there is no God. I know you’re wrong, I’ve got way too much mileage with God to ever doubt that. If I was smart enough, maybe I could beat down all your philosophies but that would not convince you anyway so what’s the point. I have a decent IQ and I know the B Ible fairly well and I’ve studied apologetics some and I love CS Lewis’ book called “Mere Christianity” which lays out in brilliant fashion how the only truly smart thing to do is to be a Christian. So if you’re honest and you want to know what the arguments are then I think you should go to Amazon or ebay right now and get that book and read it at least twice. Lewis’s book is accepted by most Christian churches as being very good for basic apologetics. It’s not an easy read, there’s a lot to chew on. But that is only for starters… I wonder if you’re willing to do what it takes to know Truth: which is to kneel before God, all by yourself, and tell Him you’re sorry. And the Bible says that we totally have to mean business when we do it. And we might have to come back a few times until all the attitudes are really straightened out before God will be willing to get down to business.

I will not enter into that endless game again, I’ve done it and it’s a huge waste of time. Athiests can waste of ton of time getting absolutely nowhere. I call athiesm a religion of DOUBT. The professional doubters. They love their doubts, they invent new ones constantly. The compare their doubts among each other and admire them and improve upon them. They build enormous libraries of all these illustrious doubts. Obviously you have a good library of them, too. Do I know what God wants?? Of course, it’s all in the Bible. It’s not a huge leap, it’s right there for any mere mortal to read. Thanks to Martin Luther and others who sacrificed to get the Word of God into the hands of common folk. I can’t prove God exists but you can’t prove He doesn’t exist, either. I have my own proof, you have to get your own. That’s how it has always worked. Until a person is willing to settle down before God and be willing to do things God’s way, they’ll never have any proof of their own. I can’t give you my proof. I would if I could, really… and I wish it was that easy – but it doesn’t work that way. The first requirement is to be willing to get down on our knees and show respect. I have a friend who is an athiest, raised by Christian parents who were prominent and very well respected. It was not an abusive home, it was a loving home that she came from. If anything she was too spoiled. Now this woman is in her 50’s and she’s gone down this long long path of rebellion for so long, I don’t know if it’s possible to eat that much crow and find her way back. I’m rather appalled at the corner she’s painted herself into. And she’s struggling with health issues too, so she may need to meet her Maker sooner than expected. I mention her only because I know the pride that’s in her life and I can see how difficult it would be to “repent”, to change, to return to her roots. To make things right. I truly hope she can find the courage to do it. You say that I am arguing from a very privileged position; I’m not quite sure what you mean by that but I kind of like it. I’ve been a Christian since I was a child. I was saved before my parents were, so it wasn’t due to influence in the home. I can’t relate to you all my “proof” but a lifetime of walking with God is so precious to me, and His Bible is so living to me, that I do feel very privileged, yes. I know how easy it would have been to make other choices, other decisions. It’s all in the little stuff, I believe that. Our lives turn on a tiny choice, sometimes. I marvel that I made the choice I did when I was 8, and I beg God even yet to forgive me for almost making the mistake that I did. I could have been selfish, I could have lied… I could have walked away and nobody would have known. Would it have been so awful, I was only 8 and it was only a small thing. But I did the right thing, and I think my whole life turned in that moment. I am very grateful to God that I have known Him all my life. It is in the small things, I believe that.

The rebellion of the 60’s flared into a rejection of everything traditional, whether cultural or religious or even political. And now, for those of us whose lives span the 1950’s to the year 2011, we honestly don’t see any improvements in our world: cultural, religious and political affairs are much worse off since this experimental age of Enlightenment began. If they had actually accomplished something I might be impressed but I’m afraid that along with so called enlightenment came greed and corruption which has nearly brought our country to ruin in the past 60 years. We were affluent due to the labors of that stuffy and traditional culture that the hippies despised. Now, analysts tell us we are facing a time of great austerity. We have ruined ourselves through the folly of our enlightenment. Yes, I agree that it’s time for mankind to get off the high horse of their own wisdom and ask God for some of His. In James chapter 1, God says He will give wisdom liberally to those who ask for it. We really need to start asking, IMO..","date":"2011-07-14","mins":"2:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/14/faith-and-challenge-in-our-age-of-enlightenment/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Faith (and Challenge) in Our Age of Enlightenment"},{"id":"comment-3343","author":"anniecee","post":"By the way, I do think that the human rights advances are worth noting as tremendous improvements.

And the prophets of the Bible also indicated that it was better to believe Jesus was coming anytime soon, than it was to deny it. The angel told the prophet Daniel that people would deny it all the way up to the end and THEN they would get caught short because of their denials. Apparently Jesus wanted us to live BELIEVING it. Yeah, it’s more Faith stuff again, whatta drag. But the thing is, that’s what Abraham was given credit for: Abraham BELIEVED and it was credited to him for righteousness. (Hebrews 11.) Abraham believed the promise, even though it didn’t happen in this lifetime. The only thing that happened was Isaac born of Sarah. Otherwise the rest of God’s covenant with Abraham was not fulfilled. And yet, Abraham believed it. His son Isaac was so convinced of the power of this blessing that Isaac’s fervor was relayed to his twin sons Esau and Jacob. The blessing and the promise belonged to Esau by birthright, but Jacob really wanted it for himself and he wanted it bad. Isaac BELIEVED it, and he taught his sons to BELIEVE it. I think we have the same obligation about the Lord’s return: we are obligated as good Christians to believe it and LIVE as if we believed it, because we do behave differently if we think Jesus is going to show up at any minute. If we choose to live this way, there is a blessing in it for us: the blessing for those who live by Faith. Besides… there are a few things that we can’t deny. Israel is in their land, and this is the MAIN thing that cannot be swept under the rug. It’s a miracle beyond any other miracle, that a race of people returns to their homeland 2000 years later. It’s impossible. And Jesus said that, when you see these things begin to happen then he will return within the span of a man’s lifetime. So…. Israel is the thing we dare not ignore. There have always been trials, disasters, wars and other traumas and tragedies, but Israel is what makes everything different in our time. Therefore, it’s necessary to sit up and take notice. Here’s a list of 101 End Times prophecies. It’s a terrific list. I don’t agree with all his interpretations, but the list is great. Http://www.understandthetimes.org/101prophecy.shtml Yes, Harold Camping was a flake for setting a date for Christ’s return, back in May. No doubt about it. But maybe God used Camping for a “trial run” so to speak. Camping’s prediction got everybody’s attention. And therefore, the reaction to it also revealed what’s in people’s hearts. Some people tried to prepare themselves for the Lord’s return (just in case), whereas others thought the whole thing was just an opportunity for mockery. So Camping’s “trial run” did some sorting and sifting. I’m sure God must have noticed what kind of response there was. Maybe God even USED Camping’s prediction as a way to warn us: not yet, but Soon. It’s time to be serious about the return of Jesus Christ, I think. Israel is the reason why..","date":"2011-08-21","mins":"7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/21/the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-end-of-the-world/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Shroud of Turin and The End Of The World"},{"id":"comment-4004","author":"anniecee","post":"I agree.

Who can say that those saints were only “Catholics”, especially if it happened before Constantine. All of Church history merges together at some point.

Today’s atheists are not skeptics, they don’t even attempt to be skeptics. They are totally closed. They claim to subscribe to science, but true science does not jump to conclusions. There is such outrageous dishonesty and hypocrisy among the “new atheists” that I don’t even attempt to engage them on their terms. Most of them don’t want to know the truth, they just want to batter down believers with their endless doubts for which there are no answers. They are like the Pharisees who tried to trick Jesus with complicated questions. His response was to point out their error rather than to engage in their ridiculous debate. Jesus said that His sheep hear His voice. And the Bible says that we will hear a voice behind us saying, “This is the way, walk ye in it.” And, without faith it is impossible to please God. And, those who come to God must believe that HE IS, and that He rewards those who diligently seek Him. (Those of you who know your Bible are familiar with all those verses.) According to the Bible we can’t even get started with God unless we drop the blasphemy and approach Him with a willingness to do this on His terms. I’m very glad this blog is here to hold down the Fort, defending the integrity of the Shroud: because obviously it is being used to reach some of these hardheads.

The more we conform to the demands (and doubts) of secular viewpoints, the more diminished Christ is: and not only in society, but in our own personal lives as well. Recently you posted a bit by a Reverend who stated that it took courage to believe in the afterlife. My goodness, has Christ been so diminished in this man’s life that he has a hard time believing even THAT? This is a classic example of the erosion I’m concerned about. We watched a new TV show last night. They had blatant swearing: taking God’s name in vain. Characters used the name of Jesus as an angry expletive, and more than once. It was many times throughout the movie. The Muslims do not allow their religion to be mocked or diminished. In some ways I can appreciate and even admire this. At the same time, I’m glad that Christians are not so violent about defending their faith. (Most of the time anyway, I know there are exceptions which are not flattering.) Jesus allowed himself to be mocked and diminished, tortured, slandered, humiliated. He let them do it. I’ve been collecting Jesus pictures: old illustrations. The pictures of Christ’s passion have really affected me, but not in the same way as Mel Gibson’s violent, brutal movie. Through the pictures I’ve seen how Christ was humiliated, and endured it. How he dreaded what was coming, so that in Gethsemane an angel had to come strengthen him. I’ve seen more of the Lord’s inner struggle. It was excruciatingly difficult for the Lord Jesus to endure what he did. I wish Mel’s movie had been more subtle and showed us more of the Lord’s inner struggle, because that’s where the biggest battle (and the greatest triumph) took place. Jesus was not a victim: he endured it all and he did it deliberately so he could finish what the Father wanted for mankind. As I’ve seen a small measure of this inner struggle, I realize with renewed clarity what an awful thing it is to diminish what Christ did for us. Considering what it cost Him, we as believers must not deny or downplay any part of what Christ accomplished. Rather, we need to speak it more clearly, more fervently and with more determination. The real TRUTH behind the Shroud is NOT whether it is real or not: but that Christ really did die an awful death and was then miraculously raised to life again. It is an empty Shroud. There is suffering in what happened to Jesus Christ, but there is also certain Victory. Whether or not the Shroud is confirmed is not nearly as important as whether Jesus Christ is affirmed and confirmed within us. John the Baptist was a great prophet whose life and ministry had been long predicted. But, when Jesus appeared on the scene, John the Baptist said, “He must increase and I must decrease.” So it is with the Shroud: if it points the way to a greater Truth than itself, then the Shroud has been affirmed and confirmed by it’s fruit — and it doesn’t really matter if it’s real or not. The greater Truth is the one that must not be diminished..","date":"2011-11-07","mins":"10:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/07/when-it-comes-to-the-shroud-i-am-right-and-you-are-wrong/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"When it comes to the Shroud I am right and you are wrong"}]
