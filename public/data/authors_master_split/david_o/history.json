What were some of the Jesus Seminar’s conclusions? According to the seminar, “Jesus was a mortal man, born of two human parents who DID NOT perform nature miracles, NOR die as a substitute for sinners NOR rise bodily from the dead. Sightings of a risen Jesus were NOTHING MORE than the visionary experiences of some of his disciples rather than physical encounters” (Jesus Seminar Wikipedia). Crossan and those of his kind are nothing more than ‘heretics’ who dismiss the historicity of the Bible and the veracity of Scripture. Serious Biblical scholars (and Sindonologists), should not waste their time debating historical revisionists who make outlandish, nonsensical claims and are purveyors in sensationalism!.","date":"2015-01-07","mins":"11:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin"}]
