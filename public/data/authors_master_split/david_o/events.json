[{"id":"comment-180550","author":"david_o","post":"To all you Shroudies out there, it would be worth your effort to visit Richard’s museum in Wabash. The building it is housed in is of a ‘grand’ design and the artifacts on display are as vast in number as they are unique in the world of Sindonology. With the Honeywell Golf Course next door, a warm weather trip would enable you to get in a quick round while at the same time immersing yourself with Richard’s very extensive Shroud collection. Do yourself a favor. You WON’T be disappointed!.","date":"2015-01-01","mins":"10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/the-wabash-museum-of-the-holy-shroud/","cat":"exhibition","title":"The Wabash Museum of the Holy Shroud"}]
