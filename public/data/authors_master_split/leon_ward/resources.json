I realize that armies of scientists with all the tools of the nuclear age available to them have not been able to determine how the image got there after years of study, but YOU, sir, seem to know and insist on not telling the rest of the world. Oh, I know, I know. It HAS to be a forgery. Just keep saying “it has to be a forgery” in spite of evidence to the contrary and that takes care of everything. Now since it has to be a forgery, could you please tell us how the Medieval forger had the presence of mind to make sure pollen from plants that only grow in or around Jerusalem to take his forgery to Jerusalem in the 14th century in order to expose it to the environment there so the cloth could gather enough pollen that it shows up centuries later? And how do you think the forger traveled to and from Israel? Did he take Air France, Al Italia, or maybe even El Al? Now stop toying with us.

I attended one of Russ Breault’s presentations recently. It lasted about 80 90 minutes. He spent about 5 minutes talking about his faith in Jesus and “the message behind the Shroud”. He spent the rest of the time making a compelling case for the authenticity of the Shroud, much of it based on science, science which the skeptics don’t have the courage to even consider, let alone accept. What really gets me is all this stuff the 1988 carbon dating tests. FOLKS, LISTEN UP.

Yes, he talks about the message in the Shroud, but he doesn’t back off from the skeptics and doubters including the scientists, and that’s because he has the facts and the science to back himself up. He is not running from a debate. He is participating in it as well as demonstrating his belief in the message of Christ. I am with him on this. I tend to be skeptical myself, but when the evidence in favor of one argument over another hits me square in the face overwhelmingly, then I have no choice (if I’m a reasonable person). I owe it to myself to admit what I might not like to admit. Breault passionately believes the Shroud is authentic, and I do as well.
