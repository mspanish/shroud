I don’t personally know what the chemical and physical characteristics of rose madder are. But, as the name implies, “rose” has a rosy color when impregnated in a linen fiber. It is not a permanent color because it is of organic origin (the plant is Rubia tinctoria). The extract, purpurin, is more permanent than rose madder. Joe Kohlbeck, on the other hand, is both a microscopist and chemist with Hercules Industries in Salt Lake City, Utah. His observation about the change of color in cargille oil is significant and one you can “take to the bank.” Agreed. This was one of the major catalyst that promoted Sue Bedfords, invisible weave theory. Keep in mind, The area that Dr. Kohlbeck was working on was the frontal view of the spear wound. All he was trying to do is improve the resolving power by “floating the sticky tape” onto a microscope slide to photograph. According to Mc Crone and Nitowski notes, slide 6 BF is similar by observation to slide 3 CB that it contains (agglomerates). According to Mc Crone, the agglomerates is iron oxide (red ochre artist pigment) Other say it’s blood (Very red) While in contact with cargile oil for three months the supposedly inorganic agglomerates now turns yellow and black and forms a yellow amorphous tubular flaked like material resin that Nitowski believes it’s either blood or myrrh. Kohlbeck also thought it was blood but after a lengthy discussion with Sue Bedford he agreed that it maybe the dye that was used in the invisible weave theory. He admitted to me he only concluded it was blood because of Dr. Heller’s work. So back to my original point both Mc Crone failed to mentioned this in his book and Dr. Rogers should have addressed this issue as well in his last paper.

Steven Schafersman is also correct when he states the madder root was first announced by Dr. Mc Crone. This is also confirmed by Paul Maloney, President of ASSIST at a Talk given at the “The Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi Faceted Enigma” conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14 17th 2008, when he states, “Walter Mc Crone had sent him in 1981 several Kodak transparencies of photos he took of Shroud linen fibers. “On those slides, (Guild also has them) Mc Crone had written the following note: madder rose, linen fiber, medium (blue) sample 3 CB” 4 and sample 3 AB. Mc Crone was referring to photomicrographs made on STURP sticky tape samples 3 CB and 3 AB which came from the blood flow across the back nearest the side strip side of the Shroud and directly adjacent to that flow on linen, itself. It was on that side where someone would have been working their repairs if the re weave theory is held to be correct. Mc Crone, of course, due to his belief that the Shroud was painted by an artist, was trying to prove that the Shroud had been in an artist’s studio.” Source: Maloney, Paul C. “What Went Wrong With the Shroud’s Radiocarbon Date? Setting itall in Context.” Talk given at the “Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multi Faceted Enigma”conference in Columbus, Ohio on August 14 17th 2008. Comments: Regarding the presence of madder rose on the cloth, Maloney says, “There is now a new way of looking at the presence of that madder rose. Although this is some distance from the “Raes Corner” such trace amounts can now be conjectured to explain the dye that was used, along with the aluminum mordant and the gum Arabic as a binder to create the wash to finish the re weave. Thus, it may now be seen not as a contaminant from an artist’s studio, but rather a contaminant from the weaver’s workshop.” cited: http://holyshroudguild.org/dr raes problematic threads 2.html.","date":"2013-05-16","mins":"8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/16/dog-in-this-fight-or-pony-in-this-race/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dog in this fight or pony in this race?"},{"id":"comment-28529","author":"giorgio","post":"My research also supports Thibault’s claims.
