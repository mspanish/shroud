I converted this file only as a jpg to reduce file size for quick access viewing. But just like film scanners too have dynamic ranges and other anomalies. Without standards all we’re doing is evaluating images with different characteristics that leads to additional issues that have to be measured. This anomalies seems to me That it’s never taken into account..","date":"2015-10-06","mins":"6:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"id":"comment-211935","author":"giorgio/hsg","post":"Hi Hugh I agree the banding has more to do with the deverging weave angles.

Correct me if I’m wrong. Your explanation seems to believe that the blood abraded from the superficial warp threads. Can it also be possible the material had a different absorption rate between warp and weft?.","date":"2015-10-11","mins":"10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/11/removing-weave-pattern-from-images-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_sites","title":"Removing Weave Pattern from Images of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-211996","author":"giorgio/hsg","post":"OK were definitely on the same page. However I do stress that resolving power and dynamic range is extremely important. This is the reason why Hugh and Thibault are misunderstanding what you’re trying to state. When they look at Evans picture they see a very high resolving power and a very wide dynamic range image making it very difficult to interpret the halftone modulation effect. If Evans macro image was captured at the same focal distance in relations to the film size of Enries the severe reduction in the resolving power would reduce the tonality forcing a contract build up that will resemble the AM modulation. We are also in agreement that the herringbone is crucial to the formation of the image So what is your theory on the image mechanism? Or do we have to buy your book. Ps i’m using speech to text so pardon if there’s typos.","date":"2015-10-07","mins":"8:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"}]
