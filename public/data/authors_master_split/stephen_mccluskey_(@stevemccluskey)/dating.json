We know C14 testing is reliable (with all the usual caveats about selecting material to insure it is representative and uncontaminated). We have no such assurance about Fanti’s methods However, if it is a fringe theory (and it may be — I’m not an expert in the field) the scientific community may be rightly reluctant to spend a lot of time and effort trying to validate what may be a dubious procedure..","date":"2013-03-29","mins":"10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/27/giulio-fanti-the-image-of-a-man-who-lived-between-280-bc-and-220-ad/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Giulio Fanti: The Image of a Man Who Lived Between 280 BC and 220 AD"}]
