[{"id":"comment-5366","author":"melody","post":"This site just “found me” and I’m so glad! I read “Heaven Is For Real” and do believe this special child saw and told about his experiences in the way he perceived them. I think adults tend to over analyze. Yes, I am guilty too. I looked at the picture and felt the man was maybe a little “too handsome” for Jesus. The Bible describes him as being common looking, not someone that would attract people due to his looks, but because of his message. Yet, who am I to say what Colton saw? Two people can see the same thing and describe it differently. To me, it doesn’t matter if there is a picture of Jesus…..or Noah’s Ark is found. We are blessed, because we “believe without seeing.” I really think that if we have faith, we don’t need justification by our five senses…..and for some who do not believe, no amount of physical “proof” will convince them otherwise. About a week before my husband passed away, I felt he was sort of “in between” this world and heaven. He appeared to be talking to people at times. He said the word “baby” a few times. I was a little confused about that. All of the sudden I felt in my heart, that he was speaking of the “baby” that I miscarried in 1998. When I told my stepdaughter, she also felt he was seeing heaven and that baby ( I was about 3 months pregnant when it happened…like Colton’s mom). He forms us in the womb, right? Little Colton’s description of seeing the baby in Heaven really brought peace to me..","date":"2011-12-09","mins":"5:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
