Guess he knows NOW, doesn’t he? The man was a hard worker, a family man, and a genius who left us all a great legacy, as far as technology.

You go, Mark Shea! “If it’s a fraud, make another one” : inarguable truth! Everything you mentioned, plus the bloodstains (NOT paint) and the photoelectric image seared into the cloth at a time when flash cameras hadn’t even been invented yet. In the same way that great pains were taken over the centuries to protect & preserve God’s word (the Bible) from being destroyed, so countless individuals over the course of history have gone to great lengths to protect & preserve the Shroud.
