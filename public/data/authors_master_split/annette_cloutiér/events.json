I can’t wait to meet Barrie myself having corresponded with him for two years, like yourself, and spoken to him from time to time over the phone… He’s very accessible and informative… which is totally unexpected for the only surviving key photographer of STURP together with his friendship providing the important liaison between Ray Rogers, Joe Marino (and Joe’s wife Sue Benford) who cracked the mystery of the skewed 1988 C14 dating. When I was at Harvard, I studied under a Jesuit confrere of Thurston’s, the then Charles Chauncey Stillman Professor of Roman Catholic Studies… the Rev. Prof. George Windsor Mac Rae, S.J. He informed me in 1978 that the Shroud was “a painting”. When I asked him who made such a statement, he said the late Herbert Thurston, S.J. Of course I didn’t accept his statement, because intuitively, even in 1978, despite no one else stating it then, I felt the Shroud gave the impetus and inspiration, i.e., was the Source, for the NT. Too bad the late Rev. Peter R. Beecher never came to Harvard..","date":"2014-02-27","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/27/barrie-schwortz-at-st-johns-from-skepticism-to-belief/","cat":"event","title":"Barrie Schwortz at St. John’s:  From Skepticism to Belief"},{"id":"comment-74953","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Someone ought to video tape this and upload it on You Tube for all seeing how the admission is free..","date":"2014-01-28","mins":"9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/28/ian-wilson-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin-in-melbourne/","cat":"event","title":"Ian Wilson to Speak on the Shroud of Turin in Melbourne"},{"id":"comment-84809","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Second that.
