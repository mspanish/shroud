However, in order to make serious sense of the phenomenon of the overpowering of Christianity something other than stories of a god man’s overcoming death with resurrection as in Osirus, Aesclepius, Mithras, et al…which were strong cults at the time… something had to energize the movement and give concrete foundation to it other than Story… Hence the Not Made With Human Hands phenomenon of the Shroud… As far as Paul being a Pharisee and not given to Plato and other burgeoning Neo Platonists of Paul’s time and culture… Pharisees were highly educated to the influx of Greco Roman ideas but clung to the belief of Resurrection, Angels, and Spiritual beings more than the Sadducees who had no appreciation for such matters… The Sadducees were this world legalists….they were also radically conservative not wanting to deal with Roman rule but rather an autonomous and self governing Jewish state.

I am “skeptical” about the testimony in the NT because the Stories are “contrived” they are an announcement and EVANGALION of the New Universal Lord written nearly a half century after the life of Our Lord. I think the NT served its purpose in creating a great energy for life in the economic efficiency of equality of SPIRIT… with Good Information told in Story of the Father delegating the work to the Son and the Son delegating the work to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit delegating the work to everyone of us equally as kings and queens who know how love can grow. So far I’ve seen very little of this obvious work that needs to be undertaken with the greatest passion in raising the dignity of one another by sincerely caring for one another–for enabling one another to be royal in love. I think the NT is a gold mine for all of us to claim a stake in the nobility of Christ… but I see that for many of us the gold mine has been used in making trinkets of jewelry. Going beyond the NT there are waves and more waves of information that could provide the Economy of Spirit via the work of equality so that no one need ever be Crucified again for the sake of Resurrection..","date":"2014-02-12","mins":"1:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"id":"comment-78715","author":"annette_cloutiér","post":"Louis you’re right… Like Hugh with the Shroud’s authenticity, I straddle the fence with the authenticity of the NT, especially the 4 Gospels.

(I would never adhere to the phrase: “Jesus of Nazareth.” I believe the first Gospel writer, Mark, invented the word from Jesus the Nazorite. It’s obvious to me that the first Gospel hagiographer also created other characters such as Mary Magdalene from Mary the Majestic Tower–the tower of Herod’s first Queen Mariamne e Maria, also Mark created the name Joseph of Arimathea which he explained carefully in Koine Greek in 15:43 means: Joseph an Aristocratic Ruler waiting for the Kingdom of God.

The apostles, including Paul, would have to taken it around while they were preaching, particularly about the Resurrection, but they didn’t do so. Louis, so sorry… I didn’t see your Quote ’til now. Well yes I do believe that the Shroud instigated Paul to writing about his Platonic Jesus then mystically becoming Christ and Mark to writing in order to bring Jesus back down to earth while leaving Paul’s mysticism intact. John Loken first wrote in his book (2010): The Shroud was the Resurrection, after which a few years later (2012) Thomas de Wesselow also concurred. The NT Biblical scholarship in both books was only a preliminary one: Loken’s out of his own logic and reasoning… de Wesselow from an art historian point of view. The Gospels are stories written decades after the time of Jesus. I am quite certain that a certain few first century devotees were allowed to see the Shroud in all its glory: a long snow white sheet with a young crucified golden man staring with bright red blood crying out in supplication… It was the Shroud that gave rise to Christianity not the Gospels itself.
