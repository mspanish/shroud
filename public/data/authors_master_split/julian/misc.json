I, too, question the majority view on the Shroud, and have learned much by visiting this blog. But I’m willing to question the majority view on other matters, especially when a large group of experts also question the majority view. I’m willing to let the matter rest there, though I’m curious: what is your criteria for when to question the majority view and when not to question it?.","date":"2014-03-20","mins":"10:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/17/the-shroud-of-turin-is-number-11-in-cnns-list-of-top-11-mysteries/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin is Number 11 in CNN’s List of Top 11 Mysteries"},{"id":"comment-91931","author":"julian","post":"Hi Mike, First, like you I am a Christian, but not because of the Shroud, nor do I believe the Shroud is authentic because I am a Christian. I probably haven’t studied it as much as you, but when the radiocarbon date came out to be the 14th century, I was puzzled, since we still had the mystery of how the image was formed. But I accepted that it was a forgery, since the hard scientific evidence seemed to prove that it was. It was only when I discovered this website (a year ago?) that I found out that there is strong reason to contest the radiocarbon dates. Now I only wish new tests would be conducted to lay to rest any doubts about the date. If it turns out to be authentic, then I suspect God preserved the Shroud for significant reasons, such as a testament to the existence of Jesus at a time when Mythicists are enjoying so much renewed popularity. As to 9/11, once I found out that there is a significant number of building experts who reject the official explanation for the collapses of all three WTC buildings, that was enough for me to question the official account. Until there is a new, independent investigation, I won’t be satisfied. It is irrelevant whether the terrorists flew planes into the WTC1 and 2. The question remains, what brought them and WTC7 down ? AE911truth maintains that it was controlled demolitions, and there is at least some physical data that seems to support their contention. If they are correct, then we can ask other questions, such as who, how, and why? Given the tremendous increases in defense and security spending that has been justified by 9/11, along with the tremendous increases in power for the intelligence community, I think it’s rather easy to find motives for 9/11, besides just terrorism. Like the Shroud, I suspect that God made sure WTC7 happened in plain sight (there is some evidence that it was originally intended to bring it down while the dust clouds from WTC1 or 2 would have made viewing WTC7’s collapse impossible) for those willing to follow the truth wherever it might lead:.","date":"2014-03-22","mins":"11:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/17/the-shroud-of-turin-is-number-11-in-cnns-list-of-top-11-mysteries/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin is Number 11 in CNN’s List of Top 11 Mysteries"},{"id":"comment-92668","author":"julian","post":"I thought I posted a link to a youtube video of President Eisenhower’s warning about the military/industrial complex, yesterday.
