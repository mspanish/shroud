I’d like to know where that information is, and if it’s available to the general public.

I'm sorry that BAR is now a mouthpiece for the views of Jacobovici, which are clearly flawed and biased, obvious even to a layman like myself. Whensomeons starts saying that an archeological find verifies claims made in a Dan Brown potboiler, you know there's something wrong..","date":"2014-04-07","mins":"9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/paradigm-collapse-trauma/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paradigm Collapse Trauma"},{"id":"comment-88872","author":"larry","post":"Very interesting theory. If the Shroud isn’t an authentic relic, then something like this would be the most likely way it was done. It still seems far fetched to me though that anyone would have thought about creating a forgery in this way in the Middle Ages. I also don’t buy the Geoffrey De Charny theory(sorry, Colin). If it’s a fake, it was meant to be Jesus Christ from day one.
