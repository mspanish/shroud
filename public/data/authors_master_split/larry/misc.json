This first allows us to recreate the exact manner of how the body was laying at the time the image was formed. The Vatican exhibit contains such a “statue” in repose and the knees and head are tilted up. Forensics tell us that any such body is in rigor mortis. We also know that rigor mortis relaxes after a max of 48 hours. Thus, the 3 D characteristic of the Shroud image establishes that the image was formed in the first 48 hours after death. In other words, we are given a timeline for image formation by the 3 D characteristic. Also interesting to note that if the person forming the image died at about 3 PM on Friday it was about 40 hours until dawn on Sunday – well within the 48 hour limit. Could this be the purpose of the 3 D?? Very interesting!!.","date":"2013-05-27","mins":"1:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/26/the-shroud-of-turin-exhibit-museum-in-alamogordo/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin Exhibit & Museum in Alamogordo"}]
