[{"id":"comment-186911","author":"charles_freeman","post":"The earliest reference I have, with illustration,is Donald King, ‘A Parallel for the Linen of the Turin Shroud’, Bulletin de CIETA, 1989, pp. 25 6. It is meant to be part of a maniple or stole and dated to the fourteenth century. One of the experts in ancient weaving I have been consulting has used three in one in weaving silk vestments. Does not prove much other than that weave was known at that time. Rarity again does not help us much. Villers has an article (.p.77) on the silk Parement of Narbonne ,a sole survival from a chapelle, a set of vestments, altar cloths and church hangings, usually made up of at least twenty cloths. It was made for the French king Charles V in the late fourteenth century but he had 57 chapelles, in total more than 1000 decorated, painted cloths, and this is the only one we still have! We have already noted that herringbone of one sort of another is vary ancient and common and has nothing to help us with the Shroud it is the distinct three in one that is rare, at least as a survivor..","date":"2015-01-28","mins":"7:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/28/is-that-another-example-of-medieval-herringbone-linen/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Is that another example of medieval herringbone linen?"}]
