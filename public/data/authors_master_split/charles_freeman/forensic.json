None of the articles I have read on Roman scourging refers to this scourging being of both front and back..","date":"2015-01-18","mins":"10:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/a-number-of-marks-falling-all-over-the-surface-of-the-body/","cat":"history","title":"A number of marks falling all over the surface of the body"},{"id":"comment-49017","author":"charles_freeman","post":"Max, you are totally incomprehensible so that even if you are the world’s number one cryptopalaeobore or whatever, no one is going to recognise the fact so why don’t you do a course in the writing of plain English?

One has to remember that in Roman catacomb art all kinds of pagan precedents were integrated into the early iconography of Christ and this appears to be one of them.
