Even Ian Wilson has been convinced!! On that issue with Flury Lemberg and other experts who have examined the Shroud close up specifically for reweaving, we can safely conclude that this is a dead end subject. I have struggled to follow the logic of even the short article Rogers wrote = my heart sinks at the idea of having to plough through a whole book of his!, so with lots of new works on painted linens and weave fragments competing for my attention, i think that the latter will have more relevance. When people ask me what to read on the Shroud, I always start them off on Beldon Scott because that is the only full length study of the Shroud based on archival research. So i am equally amazed that many who talk as if they were experts on the Shroud have not even read it. The blood tests have never been replicated, despite the enormous sophistication of blood testing in recent years. I always assumed that a test was not valid until it had been replicated by an independent investigator no such luck here. However, I have compiled my personal list of all the known bloods of Christ, bleeding hosts,etc, etc, for the fourteenth century which show that there was a big market in such relics and, although no expert I have consulted who has read Heller and Adler or looked at the Evans photographs of blood thinks that it is blood, the application of human blood to a relic claiming to be authentic was quite common in the fourteenth century and , if anyone does replicate the tests and shows that there is human blood on the Shroud, this is the first period we should be looking at for its addition. All honours,awards, etc, in whatever metal are gratefully received!.","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"6:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"id":"comment-210284","author":"charles_freeman","post":"It is not a bad idea to start with reading what a professional says about an issue I dont’t think anyone should really comment on the pollen issue until they have digested Marcia Boi’s article.

So far as I can see of the seven pollen species they picked out, their own table 3 shows that every one except the single Balanites aegiptica has a range that may include the Near East but also includes France and Spain. Therefore it would appear deeply misleading to say in their abstract that this is an indicative of. Palestinian origin of the Shroud. It could equally be indicative of an French Italian origin! They argue that the two pollen samples of the myosotis ramasissoma are of European origin and so must have been placed on later! Why are these not original, making six of the seven pollens possibly all European? I stand to be corrected but this seems a case of having decided what you want your conclusion to be and fitting the evidence to it!i As always I am interested in mentions of calcium carbonate as this is to be found in t He gesso sealing a cloth before it is painted. Good to see it coming up again!.","date":"2015-11-05","mins":"12:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/05/paper-chase-new-paper-on-sem-analysis-of-pollen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  New Paper on SEM Analysis of Pollen"},{"id":"comment-214257","author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S. And there is also the assumption that the Shroud was made, pollen dropped on the surface of the linen before it was moved anywhere and this pollen never dropped off. Unlikely, unless it was stored, say in an Egyptian tomb, until rediscovered. In fact the many unfoldings of the Shroud in the open air, well over fifty in the seventeenth century alone, make the pollen evidence very difficult to assess, especially when we may well have had visiting pilgrims not only laying their painted cloths on it ( as has been put forward as a reason, if an unlikely one – again why did these pigments never algal off again – for the existence of the pigments) but placing flowers as well..","date":"2015-11-05","mins":"1:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/05/paper-chase-new-paper-on-sem-analysis-of-pollen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  New Paper on SEM Analysis of Pollen"},{"id":"comment-214337","author":"charles_freeman","post":"It is important to stress again and again in just how many contexts the Shroud has been exposed and exhibited since Lirey.

Accounts of 1418 say that Margaret de Charny exhibited the Shroud each Easter Sunday in a meadow on the banks of the River Doubs. Lots of pollen may have drifted on at this time of year, as also in early May, the normal date on which the Shroud was exhibited. John Heller, Report on the Shroud of Turin,p. 115. Having told of the lady who brought roses to be placed by the Shroud,one of which touched it and was then passed back to her, Heller goes on: ‘Not only this woman but all the clerics and Turinese university personnel who came into contact with the Shroud invested with special meaning the act of touching it with some object with a handkerchief, a card, or some postage stamps. It was as though they felt that something mystical might be transferred from the cloth to the touched object. Or perhaps it was merely a souvenir. I would discover later that this was more the rule than the exception’. Touching or kissing a relic and placing objects on it to absorb the spiritual energy ( such touched objects were known as brandea) was such a normal part of medieval life and continued after the Reformation so attempts to link what has been found on the Shroud with the moment of its creation are fruitless unless the surface material is dated or related directly to the original flax..","date":"2015-11-07","mins":"4:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/05/paper-chase-new-paper-on-sem-analysis-of-pollen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  New Paper on SEM Analysis of Pollen"},{"id":"comment-214267","author":"charles_freeman","post":"And Lucette even admits that some recent ‘ European’ pollen they found in their sample may have been due to contamination in the aspirator that sucked up the dust!

If you are in London come and see the wonderful Indian Fabric exhibition at the V and A. With the DNA not datable and there being no clear reason why the DNA found on the Shroud should suggest that it was actually WOVEN in India, there is no need to suggest an Indian origin unless some kind of other evidence relating, say, to the pattern and dimensions of the weave is found. No one has yet come up with any. The DNA and pollen is surface material on a cloth that has been exhibited very often in the open air and specially laid out over the centuries for observers to look at. The Savoys used to kiss the wounds before it went on display. Apparently other cloths were laid on it. Rosaries were thrown at it when it was on display. There are stories that during the 1978 examination, things floated down form the ceiling onto it. Lucette raises the possibility of contamination of the samples.

This sort of study is meaningless unless one can construct a chronology showing when and how the pollen was added.

The Shroud has been exposed so many times across France and Northern Italy.
