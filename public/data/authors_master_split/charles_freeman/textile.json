One of the most important tasks still to be done in Shroud research, and one which can be done without access to the Shroud, is to create a database of all the known depictions of the Shroud. Obviously some are more accurate that others so you need to look for features that different artists in different contexts recorded. What is clear is thatis that originally there was a gap between the elbows of the back image and the main part of the body it is shown again and again by different artists who were recording expositions. Now, in the privacy of your own home, lie on your back and recreate the same pattern. You will see that you are a long way off being able to cross your arms in the front as shown on the front image. So the two bodies are separate creations..","date":"2015-10-30","mins":"1:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/28/banding-proves-cloth-was-not-repaired/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Banding Proves Cloth Was Not Repaired?"},{"id":"comment-213801","author":"charles_freeman","post":"Matthew. Sceptics are sceptics because they don’t believe that the evidence that the Shroud is first century stacks up. We are happy to follow the evidence where it leads and so would be among the first to welcome any new radiocarbon dating. If you have been keeping an eye on debates you will know that every one of your assertions has been disputed. As yet no textile expert( and Marino, Benford and Rogers had no professional background in textiles) who has examined the Shroud close up has ever found any evidence of any reweaving. You are free to respond to the arguments put forward in my article on the Origins of the Shroud. Where they have proved convincing to many is that they provide interlocking evidence for a medieval origin, e.g. The all over scourge marks on the front and back of what are two different bodies( the length of the arms do not match each other) is only known after 1300, and actually give a more precise date than the radiocarbon dating but is smack in the middle of it. I was told that the aragonite from the feet had been lost anyone know where it is? If you go around losing what you consider your best evidence, then really you should not be working in this specialist field. It would seem to be similar to the calcium carbonate that STURP found all over the Shroud samples which is indicative of the gesso mix that seals a linen before it is painted on. But untile we find it we cannot make the match that is assuming that STURP will allow access to the calcium carbonate they collected. Incidentally I, like many others, stopped communicating on the International Sceptics forum.

The two body images are not, of course , of the same body. You can see this from the way the arms don’t match (note the gap between the elbows and the body on early depictions which could not match the crossed hands on the front) they were painted ( in my view) separately and this also explains why the two bodies are different lengths. A slapdash painter?? What has particularly interested me lately is the way that the hair at the front does not fall back as one would expect. Yet in any normal work of art it does ( e.g. Giotto in the Arena chapel, in sculpture). Interestingly there are also epitaphioi where the hair of the corpse with crossed hands is also rigid and does not fall back so there may be a link there. (See the epitaphios of King Uros II Milutin of c. 1300, now in the Museum of the Orthodox Church in Belgrade,as an example.) There is an interesting art historian, Anne Derbes, who does argue that western artists did use Byzantine motifs at this period. Lots more research to do here and the Holy Graves of the fourteenth century Rhineland also seem to provide some examples close to the Man on the Shroud. I still think the Holkham Bible of 1330 is the closest template we have to the Shroud,especially the pattern of the bloodstains and the naked body on the cross. I was intrigued to find that there is scholarly backing for the idea that the Holkham Bible was used as a template for artists. See the introduction to the facsimile edition by Professor Michelle Brown, formerly Curator of Illuminated Manuscripts at the British Library. None of this will seem relevant to this site as no one accepts that the Shroud was once a painted linen. So,when I have time between other projects, I am just quietly getting my material together, knowing there is little point in sharing it here. So I am still on the painted linen, NOT a forgery, but produced for an Easter liturgical ceremony. I have yet to find a specialist medievalist who has shot me down so i shall keep on going! Like any real sceptic I am open to persuasion otherwise! it would do my relics book a great boost if we could find an authentic first century relic but no evidence I have seen to convince me that we have.

Naturally I am drawn to those who have dealt with these linens and how they disintegrate over time. If there is anyone here who has experience of medieval painted linens who can explain why the Shroud was never such, then, of course, they are welcome to contribute. STURP stated in the Physics and Chemistry paper that they had not examined any painted linens so they placed themselves outside the argument. What is important Is the very high rate of disintegration of painted surfaces and the work that experts need to do is to assess what discolouration of the linen takes place when gesso and pigments have lain over the surface off a linen and then disintegrated. The Zittau Veil images, which also lost their pigments, suggest a discolouration of the linen very similar to the Shroud.

There was lots of it around as importing raw cotton for manufacture into cloth was big business and linen and cotton weavers worked together and, as noted above, cotton threads and linen threads could alternate, as in a Milanese cloth where there was a ratio of twelve linen to three cotton warp threads. Lots of potential for cotton fibres to drift in and out of flax piles and then even, unwittingly, get spliced in ! So Raes’ claim of ‘not found in Europe” is not true of the Middle Ages and if his cotton did come in from a loom it is likely to be a medieval one. My personal view, and it echoes in a contribution by Hugh in another posting, is that there is simply not evidence of ENOUGH cotton, wherever it came from, to make a difference to radiocarbon dating. It will need a minute examination of the Shroud to find out in which other parts cotton fibres are present and, of course, these may well have come in from cotton coverings of the Shroud..","date":"2013-10-22","mins":"4:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"id":"comment-48383","author":"charles_freeman","post":"“Berry and Freeman have demonstrated is that the anomalous area is in fact of medieval origin.” If you are happy to buy that, John, and there may be objections to it, then you are only just beginning.

If that was his source he should have referenced it. Ten references for a paper that has been used as authoritative is just not good enough and his peers should have made him put them in. Flury Lemberg asked in her paper where the anomalous patch posited by Marino, Benford and Roger’s began and ended as she could not see it.

As similar figures of threads per centimetre obtain in the Middle Ages, this does not help with dating ( a point that Gilbert Raes made). The figures about a change in the number of threads per centimetre over the Shroud needs checking because no one else seems to have spotted it but it would be relevant if true.

So presumably Wilson/Flury Lemberg have either seen the originals or seen an illustrated account of them to which they have been able to relate the stitching on the Shroud .Presumably somewhere there are also illustrations of the stitching of the seam to compare the two.
