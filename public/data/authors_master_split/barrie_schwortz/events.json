The page you referenced was scheduled to be updated in our January 21, 2013 17th anniversary update. It was one of the original html pages provided to us by BSTS member Chris Jones back in 1996 and has never been updated. Our primary focus over the past year or two has been to complete the scanning and ocr of all the back BSTS issues, and the last of these will go online in January. We will also be adding pdf versions of all the old, html only issues (#43 through #48) at that time. But since you brought it up, the page in question has now been updated. As for the confusion over the “home page,” I believe David’s page is an excellent means of the BSTS getting news out quickly and serves a very good purpose in giving people advance notice on things like meetings and lectures. However, shroud.com is more of a permanent archive and long term reference library and does not try to be a “daily news blog.” We have been providing an internet presence for the BSTS since 1996. Try searching for “British Society for the Turin Shroud” on Google..","date":"2012-10-03","mins":"5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/01/davor-aslanovski-to-attend-b-s-t-s-british-society-for-the-turin-shroud-meeting/","cat":"event","title":"Davor Aslanovski to attend B.S.T.S.

And David G. For their kind words and their support. It is truly appreciated. Even though Hugh and I disagree on many issues, we share a mutual respect for each other’s points of view and we definitely had an enjoyable time together at the Hampshire event in August. For the record, the term “sold out” in my recent post was taken directly from the description of my presentations on the Museum’s website (https://www.childrensmuseum.org/exhibits/national geographic sacred journeys/barrie schwortz) and had nothing to do with finances. Admission to my lectures was free and was simply included with a paid admission to the museum. All of the proceeds go directly to support this amazing facility, which happens to be the largest children’s museum in the world. (Look it up). I would never get to travel and lecture anywhere if STERA, Inc. Had to bear the costs, so all airline tickets, hotels and most meals are typically covered by the sponsoring organizations. As for the event in England, all my expenses were covered by the Review of Religions, the publication that invited me to attend and served as my sponsor. However, neither STERA, Inc. Nor I received ANY honorarium or payment for speaking at their Jalsa event. I attended solely to open a dialogue about the Shroud with a very large Muslim group that expressed a sincere interest in the subject matter and a deep belief in its authenticity. That was enough for me to set aside my own personal concerns and inhibitions and gratefully accept the invitation. How would YOU like to be a Jewish man attending a Muslim convention to discuss a Christian relic? Yes, I do express my personal beliefs when I am lecturing or appearing publicly (as does every other Shroud lecturer), but I try to never do so on Shroud.com unless the article is clearly labeled as an editorial. That way people can separate my personal views from those of our board members or the organization itself. And no, there is never total agreement, even among the board members. If total agreement were essential for friendship in the Shroud world, NO ONE would have ANY friends! Most importantly, I never attempt to convince anyone of anything and always say so in my lectures. However, that philosophy is best expressed on the front page of Shroud.com, which has carried the following statement for almost 20 years: “We believe that if you have access to the facts, you can make up your own mind about the Shroud.” As for “pandering” at the U.K. Event, I was very open with the audiences and clearly stated that I personally believe the man of the Shroud was dead, knowing full well that I was challenging a core belief of the group that invited me. But I did so honestly and respectfully and I know that my position was appreciated by the audience. It was anything but pandering. In fact, the blogger in question lives in England and he could have easily attended the Hampshire event himself. If he had, he would have graciously been given an opportunity to express his own views, just as Hugh Farey, Pam Moon and David Rolfe did. Maybe he will do so at next year’s event, but I suspect he prefers the semi anonymity of the internet rather than appearing anywhere in person. Yes, STERA, Inc. Usually does receive an honorarium for most of my lectures (including the ones I gave at the museum), but that is paid directly to STERA, Inc. And not to me personally. The lecture fees are a small part of our very modest revenue stream that supports our work and keeps the website free of any advertising. I receive a fixed monthly salary for my full time work in maintaining the website and taking care of the organization’s day to day business. Since we are a formal 501(c)(3) non profit organization granted tax free status by the I.R.S., our tax returns are a matter of public record. In fact, Dan Porter has included that information on this blog in past years. One final thought. I absolutely do believe that one can have a personal point of view and still remain objective. Does anyone actually believe that they are mutually exclusive or that every objective person in the world has NO point of view? I have changed my mind many times on various facets of Shroud research and am willing to do so again whenever credible evidence is presented. I have been doing this for 38 years and have dealt with just about every skeptic that has come down the path. Fortunately, most of them are reasonably respectful and state their views professionally without the ad hominem personal attacks that this blogger has become notorious for. As I stated in a previous post on this blog, a little respect goes a long way..","date":"2015-09-24","mins":"10:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"id":"comment-211143","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"Hi Matthew – Contact me directly by e mail via http://www.shroud.com/email.htm and I might be able to help..","date":"2015-09-25","mins":"12:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"id":"comment-25869","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"The cabinet in which the Shroud is stored in an nitrogen/argon environment is the same cabinet in which it is displayed.

I guess they must have been spinning in their graves in 2010 when the spiritual leader of the Ahmadiyya Muslim sect (the one I visited in England) was given a personal viewing of the Shroud while it was on public display in Turin by none other than Msgr. Giuseppe Ghiberti, the then President of the Turin Diocesan Commission on the Shroud. (I’ll post a link to a video of that event in our next update). Do you think that was a mistake too?

TWO: My comment was NOT based on “secondhand comments I had heard…” but on all the scientific data presented by three experts on the Tilma from Mexico City who presented it to a group of Shroud scholars at a conference held in Jerusalem over a period of 5 days in 2013.
