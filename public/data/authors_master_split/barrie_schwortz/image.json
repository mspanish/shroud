[{"id":"comment-9667","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"Hi Ron, I am not convinced that the problem was with the Vatican, but it certainly existed in Turin. The Pope had to rely on information provided to him by his official custodian, the Archbishop of Turin, to make his decision to permit the restoration. If the Pope was told this was a necessary intervention, he would certainly have accepted that as fact and granted his permission. I believe that has all changed since the restoration and Rome is far more aware of the issues in Turin than they were in 2002. Sadly, it is too late for the Shroud and the damage was done. My personal opinion of the restoration is in total agreement with Ray Rogers and most other scientists who have studied the Shroud. I strongly urge you to read Meacham’s book when you can. It is well worth it. Perhaps the most unsettling part of what occurred was the attachment of a “new” backing cloth to the Shroud that was much whiter and brighter than the previous Holland cloth, lowering the apparent contrast of the image. Worse yet, no chemical analysis was performed on the “new” cloth to determine if it had been treated in any manner that might prove harmful to the Shroud. Remember, it is permanently attached to the back of the Shroud. In one of the press releases from Turin after the restoration, they stated that the intervention “wasn’t about science but about conservation,” as if science plays no role in the conservation of the cloth. It was that attitude that was most disappointing. I leave for a series of lectures in Canada tomorrow morning and won’t be back in my office until April 4th. I am not sure I’ll have internet access while there, so I may be silent for the next week or so. I hope this information is helpful.

The Vancouver Shroud Association has a Shroud exhibit that might be going to Toronto late this year. If that is confirmed, I’ll be there too. If so, I hope to see you there.

It was then that the incident I previously described occurred, with Max attempting to place tape on the face and Jackson stopping him. He completed his sampling under the gaze of at least 20 people in the room and he never went back to the face after Jackson’s intervention. That was his ONLY opportunity to take any tape samples from the Shroud. He never was given any additional time for further sampling. STURP worked around the clock and there was NEVER a moment when some experiment was not being performed. Consequently, there was no way for Frei to take any additional tape samples without being noticed. He could not sneak in and take samples when nobody was looking, because experiments were going on 24 hours a day around the clock during the entire five days and nights of the examination. Paul Maloney obtained a complete set of my Frei photographs in the late 1990’s and carefully produced a map of where Frei took each of his samples from, based on the photos and Frei’s notes. NO samples were taken from the face and there was NO WAY that Frei could have done so during the 1978 examination. I have no idea what the basis is for Lucotte’s claims, but it could not have been from a tape sample of the face taken by Frei in 1978. Riggi did several experiments on the cloth using an endoscopic camera system and a special vacuum but he never did ANY tape sampling himself. I hope this helps clarify the issue..","date":"2012-12-13","mins":"4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/11/coins-on-eyes-issue-again/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Coins on Eyes Issue Again"},{"id":"comment-20265","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"Sadly, Don Lynn died in October 2000.

Sadly, the Adler family packed up all his Shroud materials, including Rogers’ samples, and sent them back to Turin after Al’s death. Rogers wrote five letters to the Archbishop of Turin requesting their return but never received even one reply. In the end, Rogers considered those samples lost. So I am not so certain there are any credible Shroud blood samples actually “floating around out there.” Perhaps this issue is still open in the minds of some researchers, but the evidence shows Mc Crone was wrong. Remember, he never even saw the Shroud and based his conclusions solely on his visual examination of the tape samples.

The idea of the Shroud image being the product of scorches caused by a heated metal statue has been around for a long time (since the STURP days), and was first proposed by Joe Nickel, avowed atheist and Shroud skeptic. Since the color of the image is very similar to the color of the scorches, STURP understood the need to test this theory and performed specific experiments for that purpose. A primary test was to photograph the Shroud using ultraviolet fluorescence photography, since true scorches on linen will always fluoresce in the red. As there are many documented scorches on the Shroud from the 1532 fire, testing this was not difficult and the results of the tests were published in this peer reviewed reference: Miller, V.D. And S.F. Pellicori, “Ultraviolet Fluorescence Photography of the Shroud of Turin,” Journal of Biological Photography, Vol. 49, No. 3, 1981, pp. 71 85. Every documented scorch on the Shroud fluoresced in the red, as expected. However, the image did NOT fluoresce and in fact, even quenched the background fluorescence in the image areas. The only conclusion possible from these observations is that the Shroud image is NOT the product of scorched or heated linen..","date":"2012-02-10","mins":"8:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/10/the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The image on the Shroud of Turin is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-44637","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"The evidence for what I stated in my last posting is on the front page of the paper itself: received by the journal on 14 April 2004 and accepted for publication on 12 September 2004, five months later.
