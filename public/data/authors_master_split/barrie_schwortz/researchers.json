[{"id":"comment-37104","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"Paterson, his wife and another man, Tom Dolle, were part of STURP’s support group along with the wives of several other STURP team members, and helped pack and unpack things and provided meals and other support while we were examining the cloth over 5 days and nights, nonstop. They were unpaid volunteers and paid their own expenses. They were not in the room with the Shroud (although they helped to prepare the room before the Shroud was brought to us) and were not part of the scientific investigation. That is one of my photos on Lombatti’s blog as Jumper, Dolle and Paterson attached gold foil mylar to cover the removable steel panels of the Shroud examination table. That was BEFORE the Shroud was brought into the room. They never appear in any of my photos taken during the 5 day examination because they were not there. They were never considered STURP team members (see the actual list at http://www.shroud.com/78team.htm). Neither was Marge Jumper, Mary Stevenson (the wife of Ken Stevenson) or Patti Lynn (the wife of Don Lynn) and several others, but they all helped loading and unloading the equipment, ran errands, helped administratively, etc. Those are the facts! Sadly, Lombatti resorts to guilt by association to launch another attack on STURP. (If you can’t attack the science, attack the scientists)! This man had nothing to do with STURP’s scientific mission and, as far as I know, we had nothing to do with him before or afterwards, except in a very peripheral way. I sincerely doubt that anyone on the STURP team had any knowledge of this blog information 35 years ago, or he certainly would not have been there. However, to use that to attack the STURP team and their work 35 years later is disappointing and rather sad. To stoop to such a new low makes me believe the skeptics are truly desperate and grasping at straws! Frankly, I actually expected better of Lombatti..","date":"2013-06-15","mins":"12:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/15/an-antonio-lombatti-poop-dump/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An Antonio Lombatti Poop Dump"},{"id":"comment-10684","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"Actually, the statement about my age is correct.

I am glad to hear you found the page so useful. The Shroud Centers & Organizations page was built over the past 18 years and has grown continuously as interest in the Shroud has expanded around the world. The only problem with large numbers of links on a web page, is that links are often changed, moved or deleted over time and it is almost impossible for us to always keep every link up to date (there are thousands on shroud.com). So I really appreciate you letting us know about the broken links you found and making suggestions on how to keep them more current. Whenever anyone finds a broken link on http://www.shroud.com, just send us an e mail (via the Send Us E mail page at http://www.shroud.com/email.htm) with the broken link copied into the text, along with the specific page upon which the link was found. We’ll take it from there! Thank you again for helping us make the website more complete and accurate. Watch for the next website update on December 14th..","date":"2013-12-07","mins":"3:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/thanks-to-joe-marino-and-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thanks to Joe Marino and Barrie Schwortz"},{"id":"comment-141302","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"“A Significant Criticism?” Really? I had promised myself I would spend no more time answering the unfounded claims of Dan Porter’s favorite skeptic, but once again, I find an obviously unresearched post filled with inaccuracies and ad hominem attacks being given a prominent place on this blog under an equally offensive headline. Under those circumstances, I cannot just sit here with my mouth shut while this skeptic’s claims are promoted as “significant.” Maybe the simplest way to dispute these false claims is to look at the members of the STURP team themselves. Who were they and what was their expertise? Don Lynn of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) was director of imaging on the Voyager, Viking, Mariner and Galileo projects and probably the top imaging expert on our team. Jean Lorre was also an imaging specialist at JPL who continued working on NASA and SETI imaging projects until his untimely death in 2005. Vern Miller was the Chief Scientific photographer for STURP and had spent many years working in the aerospace industry as a scientific photographer before coming to Brooks Institute to teach in 1970. Ernest Brooks was the president and owner of Brooks Institute and an acknowledged professional photographer in his own right. Mark Evans was a graduate student at Brooks who specialized in microscopy and still works as an ophthalmologic microscopist and research photographer to this day. Don Devan was an imaging specialist at Oceanographic Services, Inc. In fact, his organization hired me as a photographic consultant for a seven month imaging project their company was doing for Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1976 (before STURP). It was Don Devan who eventually enlisted my participation in the Shroud project after we completed the Los Alamos research. Joseph Accetta (Lockheed), Steve Baumgart (Air Force Weapons Laboratory) and Tom Haverty (Rocky Mountain Thermograph) were infrared imaging specialists doing most of their work for various government organizations. Their work on the Shroud was excellent but hampered by the limited sensitivity of the infrared sensors circa 1978. Bill Mottern (Sandia Laboratory), Ron London and Roger Morris (both from Los Alamos National Laboratory) were radiographic experts, a critically important form of imaging that we applied to the Shroud. Frankly, I was probably the LEAST qualified of all the imaging people on the STURP team. As for the nonsensical statement the skeptic made about STURP ignoring the negative aspects of the Shroud image, that property was well known and documented since 1898 when Secondo Pia first made that claim, and which was further corroborated by Giuseppe Enrie when he again photographed the Shroud in 1931. Remember that the primary goal of the STURP team was to characterize the properties of the image on the Shroud. The negative aspects of the Shroud image were just one of the many unique image properties that were taken into account and integrated into all of our imaging experiments and was certainly mentioned in some of our imaging papers. So I guess we are being criticized for simply not re stating the obvious! If the skeptic had taken the time to look at the list of STURP team members and their affiliations (http://www.shroud.com/78team.htm), he would have discovered that NEARLY HALF the team members who went to Turin to gather the data in 1978 were involved in some form of imaging! That is a FACT. I have no interest (or intention) of debating anyone on this topic as the facts speaks for themselves. Perhaps a better name for this article would be “An I Nsignificant Criticism!” Enough said!.","date":"2014-07-30","mins":"5:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/30/a-significant-criticism-of-sturp/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"A Significant Criticism of STURP"},{"id":"comment-142894","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"Charles, it is my understanding that cotton was interwoven with the linen because it accepts the dyes more readily than linen, which needs to first be treated with a mordant (made of aluminum hydroxide I believe)..","date":"2014-08-07","mins":"10:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"},{"id":"comment-191228","author":"barrie_schwortz","post":"He can’t.
