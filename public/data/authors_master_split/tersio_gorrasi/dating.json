Also, this could offer clues about the other eternal debate creationism x darwinism. Explaining: In the Resurrection, Christ’s body disappeared and was rebuilt again, as suggested by the Shroud. This way, all the living creatures could arise by assembly of its component parts (God made Adam from existing matter,as quoted in Genesis), for example.","date":"2011-07-06","mins":"8:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/05/crazy-talk-are-atheists-biased-or-just-uninformed/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Crazy Talk: Are Atheists biased or just uninformed?"},{"id":"comment-4529","author":"tersio_gorrasi","post":"Supernatural phenomena, of course, cannot still be proved by scientific methods. However, we can think in a ‘scientific fashion’ about many yet unexplained phenomena. As the Shroud and the Sudarium could be both of them in contact with Someone in Whom something extraordinary happened, if we suppose that time flew backwards in the atomic structure of these cloths, they will appear with less C14 atoms than expected!.","date":"2011-11-03","mins":"5:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/02/a-reaction-to-giulio-fantis-suggestion/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Reaction to Giulio Fanti’s Suggestion"},{"id":"comment-4504","author":"tersio_gorrasi","post":"Yes, my hypothesis is that many unexplained phenomena we know from religious characters are related with some changes in the space time, that is, time flowing either backwards or forwards but limited in a certain region of the space, as if the time dimension were curved inside of itself. See for example, 2 Kings 20:9, Joshua 10:13 and Ezekiel 37:1 14. Otherwise, how can we explain Christ’s resurrection if time don’t flew backwards for His body until the time when was He arrested?.","date":"2011-11-01","mins":"8:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/31/giulio-fanti-on-the-carbon-dating-of-certain-relics/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Giulio Fanti on the Carbon Dating of Certain Relics"}]
