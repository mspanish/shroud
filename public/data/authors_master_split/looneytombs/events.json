[{"id":"comment-36395","author":"looneytombs","post":"There are claims that the Tilma, while a painted image, has been made with unidentifiable compounds and an absence of brushstrokes – that it was made in one single ‘pressing’. And that the hemp has shown little sign of natural degradation. So there is a question about image formation and the hemp base. A STURP type team could design testing protocols to validate these claims or debunk them. In the event tests were sanctioned (which I’m doubtful of) there would at least be good protocols in place for them. That’s not unproductive. You’re right though, there is massive difference between these two images in that the Shroud’s image formation may be proven, someday, to have been caused by a natural (if extraordinary) process. The Tilma can only have had, if ‘authentic’, a supernatural origin. There are no natural explanations for it — apart from direct human creation..","date":"2013-06-07","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/07/the-shroud-of-turin-our-lady-of-guadalupe-tilma/","cat":"event","title":"The Shroud of Turin & Our Lady of Guadalupe Tilma"}]
