[{"id":"comment-226","author":"uncleduke316","post":"But what about the french scientiest who showed that he made a shroud using cloth instead of a brush and a cadaver to make the three d impresisons? what about the fact that jewish customs demanded the body be WASHED before burial so where did the blood come from? would they have actually LEFT the thorn crown in there? what about the thousands of historical innacuracies with the crucifixion? what about the fact the the three othee gospels copied off of mark and mark wrote in allagory and we cant even confirm the writer of the gospels? the gospel documents carbon date to the time of the destruction of the temple, which probably inspired the writer to speak out against rome and its well known ancient jews DID feel that every suffering they experienced was ebcause they thought they offended God, so this writer was offering them an explaination for the destruction. How about all the coincidental references with the torah scriptures?and let me tell you another FACT: the romans BURNED THE BODIES IN LIME PITS AFTER THE CRUCIFIXION so the bodies wouldn’t spread DISEASE. Whoever thisis, the long haired look was probably common at that time. Thehistory channel has also gone commercial and gotten away from being about history so it can’t be taken too seriously..","date":"2008-12-15","mins":"4:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/12/01/new-shroud-documentary-to-air-on-discovery-channel-in-december/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Shroud Documentary To Air On Discovery Channel In December"}]
