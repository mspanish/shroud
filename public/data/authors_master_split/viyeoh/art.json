[{"id":"comment-3583","author":"viyeoh","post":"I have always wondered how Jesus looks like and I really thank God I stumbled upon this book ‘Heaven Is For Real’ in the bookshop. When I first looked at the painting by Akiane, I felt fear because of the piercing eyes. But upon closer inspection, I realised that His eyes actually show the love he has for me, in fact for all of us. I had backslided along my path as a Christian and I had always had this fear that I would never be able to go to Heaven and see Jesus. This accounts for my initial fear. But now I am back to having a close relationship with Jesus in the sense that I talked to Him most of the time and I had prayed that He would tell me whether I can go to Heaven one day when my time is up on earth.Perhaps this book is the answer to my prayer.I certainly hope so..","date":"2011-08-12","mins":"5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
