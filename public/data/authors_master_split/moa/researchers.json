[{"author":"moa","post":"Hello Mr. Stephen, I found your site via the Jesus is Jehovah side, along with my wife, and have followed your threads with great interest. Thank you for the hard work that you put into the research and responses of your blog. I once was rather neutral on the Shroud, but have become increasingly convinced of its authenticity upon reading and reflecting upon your proofs. I hope that as time progresses these proofs shall become even more solid even as the hearts of the world become harder for the Spirit to penetrate. As a side note, I have also found your 2037 interpretation to be quite an interesting conclusion, and am continuing to reflect and read up on your line of reasoning. Whether before or after then, my wife and I look forward to meeting you and worshiping our Lord together with you. May our risen Lord and God bless you and keep you until the day of your calling or his return.Your brother in Christ Craig.","date":"2011-01-12","mins":"9:03 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2011/01/re-john-calvin-on-shroud-2.html","title":"\nRe: John Calvin on the Shroud #2\n"}]
