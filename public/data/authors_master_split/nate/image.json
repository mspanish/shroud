[{"id":"comment-279","author":"nate","post":"I was once a shroud maven like yourselves. (I’ve read probably three quarters of all books available in English about the shroud.) Then I found a Twelve Step program for those who, like Thomas, need to have empirical “proof” of the reality of Christ and Christianity. *Hint* It’s one thing to be a “fool for Christ” in the eyes of the unbeleiving world, quite another to be a “fool for Cloth.” Grow up in Christ, stop defending a piece of flimflam and discrediting Christ in the process. PUH LEASE don’t email me breathlessly recounting the arguments in favor of the shroud. I already know them. The shroud is bunk. Plus it’s blasphemous bunk because it turns believers into weirdos for all the wrong reasons. Have fun kissing the Popes infallible ass.
