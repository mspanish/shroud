It suffered more when some supposed filamentous bacteria pointed out by Garza Valdez were reclassified as ultimate threads from the linen fibrils, and more still when it was realised that bacteria and fungi are heterotrophic and, since all their carbon would be derived from what they ate (the shroud), the radiocarbon date would not be affected by them anyway. However it is not impossible that some bacterial contamination of the shroud may have affected its chemical composition. I have know the untenable Dr.Garza Valdes’s arguments about the Shroud radiocarbon dating (also) because in March 2004 I have bought “The Orphaned Manuscript” by Alan Adler (Dorothy Crispino editor, first edition : 2002) and then I know what you wrote about the question. The objections by Adler appeared in the last article of that book : “The nature of the Body Images of the Shroud of Turin” (paper first published in : Proceedings of the Shroud of Turin International Research Conference, Brian Walsh ed., Richmond VA, 1999). As you underlined Garza Valdes indicated the problem of the accretions of microbiological organisms, in the form of a bioplastic coating as the cause of the 14 C results … B.T.W. : In the book “The DNA of God ?” (Chapter 9 : “Knights of The Round Table”) Dr. Garza Valdes indicated that Adler looked through the microscope at the slides and said that L. Garza Valdes was right, that he (Adler) had checked his fibers and found the bioplastic coating on them … Instead in the article published in 1999 the famous american chemist (Adler = 1931* – 2000 +) denied the prodigious amount of bacterial metabolism and wrote something about the claims of pervasive amount of polyester that was not seen in the whole cloth infrared spectral studies, nor in the micro FTIR studies, nor in the enzymatic studies … — — In 1998 I underlined the possibility to use the SP Ms as useful tools to detect the truth.

Reference (only as an example) : the study “Atomic force microscopic observation of surface supported human erythrocytes” Here an excerpt from the abstract >The self assembly, fine structure, cell diameter, thickness, and reticulate cytoskeleton of erythrocytes on the mica surface were investigated. The adhesive forces that correspond to the membrane elasticity of various parts of the erythrocyte membrane surface were measured directly by AFM to be 0.64±0.14 n N for cell indentation, 4.2±0.7 n N for cell hump, and 11.5 n N for side waist, respectively.

If the Image of the Shroud had been formed “through a neutron absorption event”, then we can try to check what are the exact effects of a “similar phenomenon” on linen fibres. Then, I would suggest, as possible “detection system”, the use of Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) for thin film analysis (see also: thin layers on linen fibrils…). In other words, in my opinion, a set of ATR FTIR controls can show us something of interest… And, if you want to be more exact in your controls, then you can try to do something using SP Ms techniques.

Summary >Bilirubin I Xa photooxidation products were detected by high performance liquid chromatography in the urine of neonates undergoing phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia. The in vivo photoproducts were identified by chromatographic comparison with authentic synthetic standards using two complementary methods. >Bilirubin photooxidation products were not detected in urine from jaundiced infants not receiving phototherapy. The specific photoproducts identified in the urine include propentdyopents, hematinic acid imide and its hydrolysis product (3 carboxy 2 methyl 2 hexenedioic acid), and the hydrolysis product (2 vinyl 3 methyl maleic acid) of methylvinylmaleimide. >Their total urinary concentrations were low (0.2 0.9 mg/dl) during phototherapy. These observations show that photooxidation of bilirubin clearly does occur during phototherapy. They are consistent with the view that, although photooxidation is not the major photochemical event associated with phototherapy, it can and clearly does occur concurrently with photoisomerization.

In the liver, uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronyl transferase converts bilirubin to a mixture of monoglucuronides and diglucuronides, referred to as conjugated bilirubin, which is then secreted into the bile by an ATP dependent transporter. This process is highly efficient under normal conditions, so plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentrations remain low. >A large number of disease states lead to bilirubin accumulation in plasma. Diseases that increase the rate of bilirubin formation, such as hemolysis, or diseases that reduce the rate of bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome, produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Second remark: The CFM (= Chemical Force Microscopy) can be the non destructive solution for identification problems about the compounds deriving from bilirubin degradation. Problem to solve connected to the exact timescales for bilirubin degradation: What is the feasible way (= simulation) about ageing process ? In other words: Which kind of cycles for bilirubin samples exposure ?

But the verdict by Colin (January 31 at 2:11) vanish all these questions. He saw are irrelevant due to the fact of the instability of bilirubin and Oxygen action. Then the previous questions are rejected. I believe this can be an interesting example of false problems. But, reading Adler (…These tested as blood derived residues giving positive test for the presence of protein, hemin, bilirubin… Source = “Chemical and Physical Characteristics of the Blood Stains”, Turin, 2000), I have some residual doubts… So… Not being a biologist (see also: how to show true effects of aging on bilirubin) I try to ask: Are we sure of that verdict? — — — Past references: The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood, Blog by Dan = June 1, 2013 First reference = from the article “The Origin and Nature of Blood on the Turin Shroud”, which Adler wrote in 1986 Second reference= the article “Chemical and Physical Characteristics of the Blood Stains”, which Adler wrote much later, in 2000 (just before his death). Here the message sent by Yannick on this blog in the past (October 14, 2012 at 6:40 pm): >To conclude on the question of the bilirubin level on the Sudarium, I just want to ask again the help of anyone who will read this in order to finally find the correct answer about that ! So, if someone know something about the bilirubin level that was found in the blood of the Sudarium, please, tell us the truth !!!! THANKS ! * * * * * * * * * * * Unfortunately there is not the word “bilirubin” in the St. Louis Conference Paper: “New Discoveries on the Sudarium of Oviedo” by César Barta, Rodrigo Álvarez, Almudena Ordóñez), Alfonso Sánchez and Jesús García Instead in the St. Louis Conference Paper: A Critical (Re)evaluation of the Shroud of Turin Blood Data: Strength of Evidence in the Characterization of the Bloodstains presented by Kelly P. Kearse, Ph.D. Bilirubin was indicated only two times. Now I ask: Is it improved our level of knowledge about bilirubin (= on Turin Shroud and on Sudarium of Oviedo)? I have read that: >Unconjugated bilirubin is not very soluble in water And see also, for example, the following definition: >Hematoidin = A ironless pigment derived from hemoglobin and formed within tissues, chemically similar to bilirubin. Hematoidin is a a hematogenous pigment apparently chemically identical with bilirubin but formed in the tissues from hemoglobin, particularly under conditions of reduced oxygen tension. Here another definition: >Hematoidin is a pigment derived from hemoglobin that contains no iron but is closely related to or identical to bilirubin. Hematoidin is formed intracellularly, presumably within reticuloendothelial cells, but is often found extracellularly after 5 7 days in foci of previous hemorrhage. It occurs as refractile, yellow brown and orange red granules, but more characteristically as rhomboid plates arranged in a radial pattern, so called hematoidin burrs. * * * * * * The photodecomposition of bilirubin and other bile pigments.

DOI: 10.1039/P19720000288 Source: Pub Med Abstract >The photodecomposition of bilirubin in chloroform was studied by spectrophotometry and chromatography. A fraction of the pigment decomposed with retention of the tetrapyrrolic structure, giving biliverdin, chrysin, and choletelin. The rest of the bilirubin decomposed to propentdyopents, imides, a pyrrolic acid, and simple aliphatic acids. Verdins, mesobiliviolin, and i urobilin treated similarly retained the tetrapyrrolic structure for a longer time.
