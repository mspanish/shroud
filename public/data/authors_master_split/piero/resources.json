Cellulose nanocrystals (CN Cs) are one group of nanoparticles that have high potential economic value but present substantial challenges to the development of the measurement science. Even the largest trees owe their strength to this newly appreciated class of nanomaterials. Cellulose is the world’s most abundant natural, renewable, biodegradable polymer. Cellulose occurs as whisker like microfibrils that are biosynthesized and deposited in plant material in a continuous fashion. The nanocrystals are isolated by hydrolyzing away the amorphous segments leaving the acid resistant crystalline fragments. Therefore, the basic raw material for new nanomaterial products already abounds in nature and is available to be utilized in an array of future materials. However, commercialization requires the development of efficient manufacturing processes and nanometrology to monitor quality. This paper discusses some of the instrumentation, metrology and standards issues associated with the ramping up for production and use of CN Cs.

Gibson DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2012.0341 Published 7 November 2012 Abstract The cell walls in plants are made up of just four basic building blocks: cellulose (the main structural fibre of the plant kingdom) hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. Although the microstructure of plant cell walls varies in different types of plants, broadly speaking, cellulose fibres reinforce a matrix of hemicellulose and either pectin or lignin. The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb like cells of wood to the closed cell, liquid filled foam like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young’s modulus varies from 0.3 M Pa in parenchyma to 30 G Pa in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0.3 M Pa in parenchyma to over 300 M Pa in dense palm. The moduli and compressive strength of plant materials span this entire range. This study reviews the composition and microstructure of the cell wall as well as the cellular structure in three plant materials (wood, parenchyma and arborescent palm stems) to explain the wide range in mechanical properties in plants as well as their remarkable mechanical efficiency.

(April 18, 2012) — — So… Try to produce something using the dry dust drawing technique Craig and Bresee described in 1994! You can use dry powdered Ferric Oxide (because Fe203 was reportedly found in significant amounts in image areas on the Shroud as reported by Heller, Adler, and Pellicori). Here a question connected with a phenomenon… I have read that color intensity of Ferric Oxide can change in direct proportion to changes in atmospheric humidity. Do you agree on that? Another question connected with the previous fact: Accetta and Baumgart noted variations in the spectrum on the TS when they conducted their infrared reflectance spectroscopy and thermographic investigations. (Applied Optics, 1980)…”Of particular note during the course of the experiment was the relatively large fluctuations in atmospheric absorption, especially on those days when local precipitation caused high relative humidity.” Did you knew that story? Have you taken into account inherent differences (for your work)? ———————————– It was Craig’s opinion that the image was man made and any attempt to duplicate the image is only limited by one illustrator’s ability to copy the artwork of the original illustrator. Her hypothesis was that the “dust drawing” technique can be utilized to produce an image which has all of the physical characteristics of the image on the Shroud cloth. But (… and in any case …) the technique proposed by E. Craig, even if very interesting and capable to reproduce many of the physico chemical characteristics of the Shroud of Turin, was not able to reproduce some typical characteristics of the Shroud detectable at microscopic level!!! Here my simple conclusion: The idea to work in a similar manner seems to be an useless attempt to discredit the Shroud !!! Am I wrong in my claim? Try to work using iron oxide, raw sienna, gelatin transferred to clean dry linen… and observe the results obtained (at macro and micro levels [= observations with a microscope]).

If it is important to record the nature of pollen grains, then we have to deepen the question… If the pollen grains are powdery, dust like, this is an indication about wind pollination. Usually pollen grains are sticky in insect pollinated flowers. So we have to control what are the levels of viscoelasticity and adhesion … But, after the centuries and aging, I have several doubts about the precision of that control. Is this attempt (to verify the differences) a nonsensical control ?… ————— B.T.W. : I have not yet seen the image (photo n. 17) quoted by Maloney… — — — — I have found a study: Pollenkitt Wetting Mechanism Enables Species Specific Tunable Pollen Adhesion by Haisheng Lin , Ismael Gomez , and J. Carson Meredith School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology Publication Date (Web): February 12, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Chemical Society Here an excerpt from the Abstract >Plant pollens are microscopic particles exhibiting a remarkable breadth of complex solid surface features. In addition, many pollen grains are coated with a viscous liquid, “pollenkitt”, thought to play important roles in pollen dispersion and adhesion. >However, there exist no quantitative studies of the effects of solid surface features or pollenkitt on adhesion of pollen grains, and it remains unclear what role these features play in pollen adhesion and transport. >We report AFM adhesion measurements of five pollen species with a series of test surfaces in which each pollen has a unique solid surface morphology and pollenkitt volume. >The results indicate that the combination of surface morphology (size and shape of echinate or reticulate features) with the pollenkitt volume provides pollens with a remarkably tunable adhesion to surfaces. THERE ARE TWO ALTERNATIVES : >With pollenkitt removed, pollen grains had relatively low adhesion strengths that were independent of surface chemistry and scalable with the tip radius of the pollen’s ornamentation features, according to the Hamaker model. >With the pollenkitt intact, adhesion was up to 3–6 times higher than the dry grains and exhibited strong substrate dependence. — — What is your own conclusion ? — — Here I want to add another excerpt from the Abstract: >The combination of high pollenkitt volume and large convex, spiny surface features in echinate entomophilous varieties appears to enhance the spreading area of the liquid pollenkitt relative to varieties of pollen with less pollenkitt volume and less pronounced surface features. — — — — What is pollenkitt? Link: http://www.honeybeesuite.com/2010/03/page/2/ >Pollenkitt is a sticky covering found on the surface of pollen grains. It is also spelled “pollen kit” or “pollenkit” and is sometimes called “pollen coat.” It is found in some plant families more often than others, but it is especially common in plants that are pollinated by insects. Because of this, scientists believe that one of the major functions of pollenkitt is to help the pollen stick to the bugs. >Honey bees have special body parts where they pack pollen to be carried back to the hive. The parts—one on each hind leg—are called corbiculae or “pollen baskets.” The corbiculae are covered with hairs which help to hold the pollen in place, but very sticky pollen can form large clumps—something that makes provisioning even easier. >The pollen from many wind pollinated plants, such as grass, is much drier and not nearly so sticky. This pollen has to be carried in smaller clumps and so the bees have to make more trips to collect an equal amount, which wastes both time and energy. … … >Plants that are insect pollinated not only have sticky pollen, they have lots of pollen. This provides the win win relationship that defines plant pollinator mutualisms. … .. >Researchers have suggested many other reasons for pollenkitt and, in truth, it probably has multiple functions. It may keep the pollen from blowing away or drying out, or it may protect the pollen from ultra violet radiation and certain pathogens. — — I hope in your comments ….","date":"2014-08-01","mins":"12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/28/a-new-paper-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A New Paper by Paul Maloney"},{"id":"comment-204859","author":"piero","post":"I have found some lines about an interesting miracle: the “Painted By Angels” (1754)… = Colombia’s Miracle Portrait of Virgin & Child… >…The Gothic style church is considered one of the architectural wonders of the world, and according to the testimonials that line the walkways leading to the church, Las Lajas is rich in miraculous cures. >Most miraculous of all, however, is the portrait of Our Lady and Child, along with St. Francis and St. Dominic, which appears to be painted on rock. >But German scientists, after boring through various parts of the “painting,” discovered that the rich surface colors are not paint, but are the actual colors of the rock, which run several feet deep. >Indeed, no one has ever come up with an explanation for the phenomenal painting. … Link: http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7471 Until now I have not yet seen the inherent scientific controls… Have you tried to find some scientific news about the “German scientists” ?

Alan Adler (source: “The orphaned manuscript”) wrote something about one class of the test objects that can be clearly identified as ferric iron oxides particles (= reddish, birefringent, pleochroic, with a positive spot test for iron only if predigested with H Cl)… In any case he (= Dr. Adler) underlined that these objects were found predominantly only in the scorched blood areas and in waterstain margins. The combustion of blood is known to produce ferric oxide and its presence in the scorched blood area was expected… Perhaps these particles were also present on original Holland backing cloth. But it should not exist a role of them in the case of thin layers on linen fibrils (= then: no as chromophore for Bodily Image). Here what I wrote few days ago (in August 14, 2015 at 5:17 am): >Yesterday, rethinking what you wrote about “Mc Crone’s tunnel vision” and the mis identification: “iron oxide as the chromophore” I was able to solve the simple problem. >In other words: the use of diimide can be understood starting from the fact of iron oxide presence, because … if you treat cotton stained with iron oxides then you create an hole on your cotton cloth. >The same can happen on linen fibrils. >So, if you destroy your proof you cannot win … >This was the point to consider. >Probably they (= “STURP”) had feared iron’s oxides presence. >Then I hope you want to pardon my previous waste of time with useless discussion. >Am I wrong in my conclusion? … etc., etc. … >Try to treat a cloth with particles of rust and then try to use Na Cl O in order to show what happens (at different p H)… >And also I think you can adequately distribute rust particles in order to make pinholes in a cloth… … etc., etc. … — — — >In Industrial works the bleaching equipment should be made of stainless steel, to avoid the catalytic degradation of the cellulose in presence of copper and iron [tank construction is stainless steel (AISI 316, etc.)]. >Before to end, few other “chemical words”. >If you want to become a good worker (…sorry!) in this textile field, then you can add an organic sequestering agent to chelate the ferrous ions and prevent redeposition or adsorption of iron compounds onto the fibers, and recovering the bleached substantially iron free fibrous cellulose. … etc., etc. … — — So: why no one told me about my solution to the “problem of the lack of use of Na Cl O”?

For example, I have found the following description: >Electrostatic painting is commonly called powder coating. It is a dry powder mix of resin and pigment. The mix is positively charged in the paint sprayer and sprayed onto the finished surface by air. The painted object is grounded to give it a negative charge. The powder is only attracted to the finished object, so it spreads uniformly over the most irregular and complicated surfaces. … Link:http://www.ehow.com/facts 6684816 kind paint used electrostatic painting .html and this one: >The term electrostatics or electrostatic spray finishing refers to a spray finishing process in which electrical charges and electric fields are used to attract particles of atomized coating material to the target (the object to be coated). In the most common types of electrostatic systems, electrical charges are applied to the coating material and the target is grounded, creating an electric field. The charged particles of coating material are drawn by the electric field to the surface of the grounded target because of the attraction of opposing electrical charges. … Here another excerpt: >In a corona charging system, a high voltage generator is used to charge an electrode at the tip of the powder gun. This creates an electrostatic field (or corona) between the gun and the substrate. >Gas molecules in the air pick up electrons emitted from the corona. This negative charge is, in turn, transferred to the powder particles as they are propelled from the gun head towards the substrate. >The charged powder particles are deposited on the earthed substrate. >Electrostatic spraying gun system has been the most popular coating methods for powder coating powder. Link: http://www.chinapowdercoating.com/tag/electrostatic spraying/page/2 So… Is it possible to think the Shroud as a sort of electrostatic painting? — — I think this idea (= the Shroud as a sort of “electrostatic painting”) has the defect of being different from what we can observe about the Shroud: looking the Shroud we see only a weak superficial action and so there is no true penetration into the material (apart from the claims by Fanti and Maggiolo about the existence of the “second face”, a phenomenon that was [interpreted in a different manner by Rogers, who, instead of the Corona Discharge, indicated the absorption desorption effect about the behavior of linen fibres] denied by Balossino …). In any case we have to test under the advanced microscope the linen fibrils coming from the Image of the Shroud, before to speak too about the hypothesis of an “event horizon” or “horizon of the Hell” or whatsoever thing you want to think… But we should also take into account the effect of the passage of time, the aging of the “mysterious picture” … this without necessarily having to arrive to the exaggerations of Charles Freeman (I hope that our poor friend Charles will forgive me for this term a bit severe…) about the past appearance of the Shroud… So, what now I want to emphasize is that we have not yet observed the aging of what was produced by Di Lazzaro (apart from a special case already considered by himself…)..","date":"2015-04-15","mins":"9:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/14/interview-with-paolo-di-lazzaro/","cat":"article","title":"Interview with Paolo Di Lazzaro"},{"id":"comment-196321","author":"piero","post":"I would add, however, an attempt of mine to clarify: I’m afraid that might happen the phenomena of “thermal pollution” during production (= adequate experiments done with the use of that polyurethane/metallic blend ) of the image on the Shroud, namely: a bit like what Rogers told me to have happened with the experiments performed (but here I speak about things of the past) from known researcher Giovanna De Liso … So, I cannot exclude a sameness to what had happened with linen fibrils produced by De Liso.

Giuseppe Ghiberti and his life in Turin, but the haughty approach by Louis about the biblical studies by Ghiberti and the attempt to dialogue with another religion during a meeting is a bit strange …or worrying…. Here I want to add few lines: although I understand the critical situation (and the urgent need to dialogue to prevent extremist acts from both followers), it’s hard to believe that Muslims [apart the strange heretic sect Ahmadhija, well known for particular ideas and strange interests about Jesus, the Rozabal, etc.] and Christians find common ground on the Shroud. Here another question (apparently far from the subject treated here): Ludvik Leibler is a French physicist who has developed a revolutionary new technique about the use of a nanoparticle solution made from polymers to connect human tissue. He has been awarded with Descartes Huygens Prize (a prize set up by the French and Dutch governments in 1995). In the past he won an ACS Award in Polymer Chemistry for his pioneering work on the self assembly of polymer systems. If we wiil be able to show the true epoch of the Ancient Linen (without to destroy the Holy Shroud!), but I don’t believe we will be in the list for these future Awards if we are not able to do something instead to discuss about the Koran. This question seems to be very important and all the scientists (independently from their religious ideas. See also the example of Pontifical Academia…) can collaborate in order to discover the truth. So, the words by Msgr. Ghiberti should be an interesting point to start toward this direction. But, knowing something about the ideas of Pallavicini (who seemed to be rigorous about Tradition, etc.), I have some doubt… because I believe thee approach by Co.re.is (Islamic religious community) to the Christian world and Tradition is a knotty problem. I like the idea nevertheless, then I hope in that possible inter religious (and also scientific, if possible…) dialogue… There is a German book that can be indicated as an exemple of what some layman can read about the Shroud: Das Jesu Komplott, by Holger Kersten and Elmar Gruber ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger Kersten ) and then a particular Islamic Tradition (connected with these ideas) can be understood [= the first book by Holger Kersten: “Jesus Lived in India” promotes the claims both of Nicolas Notovich (1894) regarding the unknown years of Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30 in India, also Ahmadiyya founder Ghulam Ahmad’s claims regarding the years aged 33 to age 120 in India, and the burial of Jesus at the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar]. But I don’t believe that Pallavicini is in this field of Islamic Tradition, then a more refined Knowledge (avoiding blasphemies!) is required to discuss a Mystery of Faith, this is an useful way for both religious fields. Perhaps there are several studies connected : – Gnostics – Liber Schale Machometi (= “Halmahereig”, translated by Abraham Alfaquim) – question of “Ascended Masters” and inherent Traditions, starting from – the ancient Pharaohs, For example: >Amenhotep III is believed to have begun his rule at about the age of nine. It is likely that a relative acted as regent for him until he came of age. As an Egyptian Pharaoh, Amenhotep III, and his wife Tiye are known as the founders of monotheism in Egypt, a practice continued and expanded by one of Amenhotep’s sons, Akhenaten, an incarnation of an ascended master … (Warning!!!

I was curious to see what were the results from the application of Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors (= SSNT Ds) in experiments about Image Formation (then: included neutron dosimetry …), but I didn’t believe in this particular way as explanation for the mysterious Image. Perhaps we can try to simulate an “AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) inspection on exposed SSNTD” model with Comsol Multiphysics. See also the useful “personnel neutron dosimetry” in nuclear plants. For this question I have found the following study: “Different etching processes of damage track detectors for personnel neutron dosimetry” by L. Tommasino, G. Zapparoli, P. Spiezia, R.V. Griffith, G. Espinosa (It is available online since 29 August 2002) Abstract >The advantages and limitations of different etching processes of CR 39 detectors for personnel neutron dosimetry are analysed. The chemical etching can be considered the converse of the electrochemical etching, since the former provides very poor response to low energy neutrons, while the latter greatly simplifies the registration of these neutrons.

Carpinteri, A. Chiodoni, A. Manuello, R. Sandrone Link: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978 1 4419 9798 2 7 Reading the inherent abstract we can see the absence of SSNTD: Abstract >In the present paper, Energy Dispersive X ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on different samples of external or fracture surfaces coming from specimens used in piezonuclear tests [1,2]. For each sample, different measurements of the same crystalline phases (phengite and biotite) were performed in order to get averaged information of the chemical composition and to detect possible piezonuclear transmutations from iron to lighter elements. The results of EDS analyses show that, in the fracture surface samples, a considerable reduction in the iron content (~25%) seems to be counterbalanced by an increase in Al, Si, and Mg concentrations. Reading what is able to do EDS we can turn perplexed about what really happened in the experiments by Carpinteri : >Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy (EDS, EDX, or XEDS), sometimes called energy dispersive X ray analysis (EDXA) or energy dispersive X ray microanalysis (EDXMA), is an analytical technique used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample. It relies on an interaction of some source of X ray excitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are due in large part to the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure allowing unique set of peaks on its X ray emission spectrum. … Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy — — So… What happened? Another question similar to the “C14 1988”? I don’t know… Were the results of EDS analyses a wrong approach? Were the EDS analyses wrong?

Really Carpinteri results were not replicated? Zero neutrons? Attention, please: as you can see, I am not referring to gamma rays, I only refer to the strange neutron emissions. In the article by Spallone, Calamai and Tripodi (published online in August 2010) we can read: >Mistake in the analysis of neutron detection due to intense acoustic signal or charged particle emitted in fractoemission phenomena is suggested. But EDS analyses were not mentioned… Unfortunately I have not read the entire article (only the abstract).

De Liso, C. Fidani and A. Viotto (published in “Earth Science”, February 2014): “Unusual animal behaviour before earthquakes and multiple parameter monitoring in Western Piedmont.” This note indicated the study by: Carpinteri A, Lacidogna G, Manuello A, Borla O. “Piezonuclear Transmutations in Brittle Rocks under Mechanical Loading: Microchemical Analysis and Geological Confirmations”. In Symposium on Recent Advances in Mechanics, Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece, 17 19 September, book part III: 361 382, Editors Anthony N. Kounadis, Emmanuel E. Gdoutos, Editors Affiliations: Academy of Athens, Dept. Of Civil Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace; 2009 Therefore De Liso and the other researchers of that study had chosen a rather special support (prof. Carpinteri and his particular piezonuclear claims) that now seems in doubt weight … unless extraterrestrial beings have really suggested to De Liso the right way in order to go towards the Truth … In the past De Liso was defined by Garlaschelli (link: http://www.uaar.it/news/2014/02/17/sindone terremoti intervento luigi garlaschelli/ as “soprano, painter, former sighting of aliens, now become experimental sindonologist…” (Italian words = “soprano, pittrice, ex avvistatrice di alieni, ora diventata sindonologa sperimentale”…). Now I want to clarify that I do not want to judge a researcher (Giovanna De Liso) for her claims about UF Os, abductions, etc. Unfortunately I had only exchanged few words with her in 2002 (near Paris). I have only taken note of what was written by prof. Luigi Garlaschelli (and then echoed by Nicolotti)… Was (an is) our humanity driven by extraterrestrial beings? Maybe it was better to believe the good angels, them there were not deceiving. However I think it would be better not come to confusion between extraterrestrials and angels (= pure spirits) … these are special topics. What drove Carpinteri to pursue a nuclear physics research deemed impossible by the rest of the scientific community in no time losing the authority conquered in a good career? The piezonuclear question seemed to be very controversial also because De Liso said (in an italian webpage), in a letter published in November 15, 2012 : “… we have seen neutron detectors, which marked the presence of neutrons at the time of rupture of gneiss … Link: http://oggiscienza.it/2012/10/25/istituto nazionale di ricerca in misterologia/ … and I have read on the Web that Giovanna de Liso was also named as an expert in ufology and collaborator of CUN (a Italian National “UFO Center”). * * * * * * * * * * In any case the Luserna Stone (Pietra di Luserna) >is a leucogranitic orthogneiss, characterized by a micro Augen texture, with a marked foliation that is mostly associated to a visible lineation: it geologically pertains to the Dora Maira Massif, and outcrops in a quite large area (approximately 50 km2) of the Cottian Alps, on the border between the Turin and Cuneo provinces (Piemonte, Italy)… Link: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/259080763 Quantitative phase analysis (QPA) of the Luserna Stone BTW: I remember that years ago I have read a study about: “Fine atomic image of mica cleavage planes obtaiend with an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a novel procedure for image processing” Abstract: >Potassium layers and basal oxygen layers in muscovite and biotite cleavage planes were clearly discerned by an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a novel procedure for image processing. Unit cell sizes of muscovite and biotite determined by this procedure were in good accordance with those determined by X ray structural analysis. Expected differences in the structures of muscovite and biotite, that is, the atomic arrangement of oxygen in the tetrahedral sheet, were clearly demonstrated from the processed images. Now I doubt that this technique may serve to then be able to gain more control over what is left after the fracturing process… Perhaps one can try to do some new controls on biotite cleavage planes in order to better investigate the negative problems already seen with EDS. * * * * * * * * * * * Here another question about the use of microscopy… but about Charles Freeman and not regarding De Liso or Carpinteri: I think Charles should consider the following fact: Prof. P.

As evoked by the Greek root of the word, they are caused by pressure waves, in both liquids and solids. The salient results, which have already appeared in authoritative international journals of experimental physics or mechanics, provide direct and indirect evidence of the occurrence of piezonuclear reactions. Indirect evidence includes the neutron emissions that have been detected in a regular and reproducible fashion using different types of detector. Direct evidence of piezonuclear reactions was obtained through a brand new spectroscopic technique, EDS, which, by comparing a statistically significant number of spots lying on the outer surface or the fracture faces of the granite specimen, and aiming directly on the only two iron ores present – Phengite and Biotite – was able to ascertain that iron, on average, was locally reduced by 25% and was replaced with atoms of aluminium (atomic number =13, half that of iron), silicon (atomic number =14) and magnesium (atomic number =12). Thus, the split was symmetrical in the case of aluminium, asymmetrical in the other instances. If these reactions can take place in a laboratory, where pressure and temperature conditions are much lower and, especially, the masses at play are much smaller than those found in the deep layers of the earth’s crust, they are bound to take place on a much larger scale within the latter, triggered by fracturing and crushing phenomena of seismic and tectonic origin. On the other hand, neutron fluxes up to a thousand times the natural background level may be detected before and during earthquakes, including medium magnitude ones. … … etc. … … etc. Link: http://www.jacques benveniste.org/coherence 15 ottobre 2013 Roma CIRPS.pdf — — — Hugh, I want to emphasize that I am not a fan of science fiction or pseudoscience, I just want to see what’s true around the world … If someone tells me that there are “chemical proofs” that confirm the piezonuclear transformation of biotite and phengite, then I can believe what he says. Instead if I was duped by false chemical tests, then this is another question … These are the terms of the problem, IMO. — — Then we have to read the following paper: “Comments on ‘Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s Crust’ by A. Carpinteri and A. Manuello”, by U. Bardi and G. Comoretto This was an article first published online: 7 Nov 2013 Abstract: >In ‘Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s Crust’ [Carpinteri and Manuello, Strain (2011) 47(2), 267], the authors claim that the composition of the Earth’s crust and of its atmosphere can be explained by hypothetical piezonuclear reactions.

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a promising technique for the detection of these materials, yet concerns over the sensitivity of SERS spectra of dyes to chemical and instrumental variables (such as p H, choice of SERS substrates and/or aggregants, and excitation wavelength) have prevented its widespread use in analytical applications. Over the last few years, the development of several microanalytical approaches has considerably increased the chances of success in the identification of minute amounts of dyes by SERS.

Many sindonologists – not only Catholics, but also Jews, atheists, agnostics and Christians from different churches – are convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud that tradition reveres as burial cloth of Jesus. During the making of this special issue dedicated to the Holy Shroud, in view the exposition of April, we discussed, among others, with Giuseppe Canopies, physical ENEA Frascati (Rome), Emanuela Marinelli, Professor of Natural Sciences, and Domenico Repice, theologian (that for our Special realized some services that will be published in the coming weeks).

As I first asked on this blog [message dated September 8, 2015] we can read a comment connected to the interesting (and, perhaps, controversial…) book by William Meacham … Here what I wrote [September 8, 2015]: >Anyway, we can also try to consider what Prof. William Meacham wrote in the book: “The Rape of the Turin Shroud: How Christianity’s most precious relic was wrongly condemned, and violated” (= That book describes the two major fiascos to have afflicted the Turin Shroud in recent years: the C 14 dating of 1988 and the so called “restoration” of 2002…)… We can remember that previously unpublished photographs of the Shroud, taken by STURP using Quad Mosaic Photography (state of the art NASA technology) at the time, were published in the scientific journal “Chemistry Today” by Marino and Benford in 2008 in a paper entitled “Discrepancies in the Radiocarbon Dating Area of the Turin Shroud” and the fact that these “unpublished photographs of the Shroud” showed “anomalies in the radiocarbon sample area”… (see, for example, the paper by Mark Oxley under the address: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf and the paper by Barrie Schwortz: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf.). But the issue turned as another controversial proof… Then I think we have to solve an interesting “Four corner and center (of the Shroud) [UV Photographs]” problem! Well. How to exit from that conundrum? Now I ask: 1 Is it possible to photograph the sample from the so called “reserve” using ultraviolet fluorescence photography? 2 Is it possible to photograph (another time) the Shroud using ultraviolet fluorescence photography? 3 Is it possible to photograph the Shroud sample of Arizona using ultraviolet fluorescence photography? Is too difficult to obtain the permission to do all these simple works? In that case we still can think to start trying the checks after a positive answer only to the questions number 1 and 3… (and also this work it’s obviously feasible only with inherent permissions). But (probably) we still require another check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud (as main reference) because the controls, without the adequate reference (= the check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud), seems to be a bit inconclusive … or …Would we retain the old UV data (from the main body of the Shroud) as useful reference? In any case if Prof. Jull (of the University of Arizona) want be gentle with us and provide us the useful UV photograph for Arizona sample, that fact will be an interesting “great progress”. But this is not a great progress. So… I think we can try to reflect how to write a Plan to submit to the attention of Prof. Jull. Another thing: don’t like mass spectrometry and I prefer non destructive analyses… Is that preliminar work on that Arizona sample too difficult?

Fungal attacks on cellulose : the attacks by fungi can alter the cellulosic DP. I think it’s good to remember that fact when you want to indicate or suggest control of DP cellulose as a way of “dating of the Shroud” … Well. Here some words: Fungal cellobiohydrolases act at liquid solid interfaces. They have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose chains of a crystalline substrate because of their two domain structure, i.e. Cellulose binding domain and catalytic domain, and unique active site architecture… Cellobiohydrolases (CBH’s), attack cellulose from the non reducing ends of the cellulose polymers and yield cellobiose (a glucose dimer) as a majorproduct. Two types of CBH enzymes are known: cellobiohydrolase l (CBHI) which generates cellobiose exclusively, and cellobiohydrolase ll ~CBHII) which generates a mixture of cellobiose and glucose. CBH enzymes have not been found in cellulolytic, non filamentous bacteria, and thus appear to be limited to fungal and filamentous bacterial sources. — — Third question: I never try to polemizar with Jamon on what has instead written Agnoli … because I’ve already enough pockets full of false coins with what I jump out with the bad Google translations … — — — In any case I have found the following paper: Complexity of Spoken Versus Written Language for Machine Translation Nick Ruiz Conference: European Association of Machine Translation, At Dubrovnik, Croatia Abstract >When machine translation researchers participate in evaluation tasks, they typically design their primary submissions using ideas that are not genre specific.

The research includes three new tests, two chemical ones and one mechanical one. The first two were carried out with an FT IR system, so using infra red light, and the other using Raman spectroscopy. The third was a multi parametric mechanical test based on five different mechanical parameters linked to the voltage of the wire. The machine used to examine the Shroud’s fibres and test traction, allowed researchers to examine tiny fibres alongside about twenty samples of cloth dated between 3000 BC and 2000 AD. The new tests carried out in the University of Padua labs were carried out by a number of university professors from various Italian universities and agree that the Shroud dates back to the period when Jesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem. Final results show that the Shroud fibres examined produced the following dates, all of which are 95% certain and centuries away from the medieval dating obtained with Carbon 14 testing in 1988: the dates given to the Shroud after FT IR testing, is 300 BC ±400, 200 BC ±500 after Raman testing and 400 AD ±400 after multi parametric mechanical testing. The average of all three dates is 33 BC ±250 years. The book’s authors observed that the uncertainty of this date is less than the single uncertainties and the date is compatible with the historic date of Jesus’ death on the cross, which historians claim occurred in 30 AD. The tests were carried out using tiny fibres of material extracted from the Shroud by micro analyst Giovanni Riggi di Numana who passed away in 2008 but had participated in the1988 research project and gave the material to Fanti through the cultural institute Fondazione 3 M.

If you have taken an interest in that analytic field there is a study titled : DHM (Digital Holography Microscope) for imaging cells You can read that work under the address : http://iopscience.iop.org/1742 6596/61/1/260 Denis Gabor invented in 1948 a way to encode the phase as an intensity variation: the “hologram” [D.

The DHM implements digitally this powerful hologram … — — In any case I believe that Giulio Fanti is able to work in the field of Applied Mechanics in order to show something of interest about the linen fibrils. — — See also, for example, the study : Comparative Research of the Dynamic Young’s Module of Fibres by Więcek T, Konecki W. Published in : FIBRES & TEXTILES in Eastern Europe 2012; 20, 5(94): 36 40. Abstract: >This work presents an investigation of the dynamic Young’s modulus for fibres of varied thickness performed on an Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer (IMS) and Dynamic Mechanical Analyser (DMA). The IMS was designed and built by the authors and the DMA instrument was produced by TA Instrument Co (USA). Because different methods are applied for determination of the dynamic Young’s modulus it was necessary to perform a comparison analysis of the results received from the IMS and DMA, which are currently the most frequently used testers. This analysis shows that an IMS can be used when a DMA cannot be applied. The parameter set comprising the dynamic Young’s modulus for longitudinal vibrations can find application in material engineering in industry. The DMA method does not require the application of mathematical formulas to determine Young’s modulus but requires calibration as apposed to IMS. Measurements of the elasticity modulus were carried out under automatically stabilised climatic conditions. The compliance of the results obtained allows us to evaluate positively the performance of the Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer. Comparison of the results makes it possible to determine the measuring possibilities of the DMA and IMS and show the advantages of IMS over DMA. — — What is your opinion ?

I hope in your contributions. If we want to work with the preliminar experiments there are several things to do … For example : What is the difference about flash heating with respect repeated laser spots ? I remember that Ray Rogers (= RR) indicated the fact that Joan Rogers subjected linen to flash heating with lasers observing ablation without any color formation … The conclusion by RR was the following : intense rapid heating can not explain image formation and he add that the primary effect of any kind of radiation is heating; therefore the image color can not be a result of a flsh of any kind of radiation ! Instead Paolo Di Lazzaro and others researchers ( http://www.frascati.enea.it/fis/lac/excimer/sindone/Di%20 Lazzaro%20 %20deep%20ultraviolet%20radiation%20 %20 JIST.pdf ) have been able to use the laser on linen and they claim that linen fibrils treated in that manner are similar to those of the Shroud … and … then I ask : are we sure ? So, I think that investigating the matter using the AFM on treated linen fibrils (here the main linen treatments to control : Corona Discharge, excimer lasers, only Maillard pathway, etc.) will be the right way to work and in that manner we can hope to obtain the scientific truth. — — The use of AFM in Biology. The Atomic Force Microscope “images” individual molecules by monitoring the flexing of a micromachined cantilever as it scans over a surface with a sharp tip, contacting molecules deposited on the surface. The deflection of the AFM tip as it responds to sample topography is measured by reflected laser light and converted to a digital image map of molecule locations on the surface, plus their height profiles. This technique can be used in a number of ways and various biological applications have been developed. — — If the blood derived, for example, from a puncture caused by a needle used during sewing (after the Fire of 1532) then we can observe the differences in a more exact manner … — — In conclusion : All that we have to do is to apply the SPM techniques avoiding the great destructions (example = 14 C tests). — — Regards, Piero.","date":"2014-01-30","mins":"1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/28/moving-the-exclamation-point/","cat":"books","title":"Moving the Exclamation Point"},{"id":"comment-204253","author":"piero","post":"Personally I have found very interesting the solution against the old carbon dating for the Shroud (the results of 1988, coming from the 14 C test) = the numismatic dating of the Shroud!

Then the Shroud of Turin was contaminated by water … and the idea by Pam Moon is that the major watermarks were caused by water that was contaminated, this is a possible controversial idea (see : the Fire in 1532 and the water used)… So, we have to try to work in a safe area (previously chosen using the optical microscopy), avoiding the area of presumed contamination (from the humic and fulvic acid from the soil).

It is the basis of new applications in the field of Raman microprobing and improvements in Raman imaging techniques. The basic principle of confocal microscopy is reviewed and its extension to Raman spectroscopy is discussed in terms of improved depth resolution which results in better background discrimination. A new concept of Raman imaging is also presented which benefits from the confocal system and overcomes most of the limitations of direct imaging techniques. A dual fibre optic remote analysis scheme is described which has been developed to optimize the collection of the scattered light while minimizing the interference from the optical fibres. . — — — *** — — B.T.W. : Do you know the Polarized Raman Microspectroscopy?.","date":"2014-08-25","mins":"10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"id":"comment-146236","author":"piero","post":"Try to consider: Raman AFM and nano Raman (TERS)… See under the address: http://www.horiba.com/us/en/scientific/products/raman spectroscopy/raman afm and nano raman/configuration/ Configurations for Raman AFM and TERS imaging ….","date":"2014-08-26","mins":"5:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"id":"comment-204057","author":"piero","post":"I have seen that finally you (and of course I am referring in particular to “daveb of wellington nz”!) have improved your comprehension of the matter (…but this happens after my many posts on the subject) … I’m happy for this late deepening of problems.

Now I have at hand the book (2007, Italian translation) of the previous Pope (= “Papa emeritus”) Benedictus XIV: “Jesus von Nazareth – Von der Taufe im Jordan bis zur Verklaerung” and then we can read the name “Harnack” as associated in a papal examination for a line of thought: … Adolf von Harnack (a German Lutheran theologian and prominent church historian), the liberal theology of XX century, the message of Christ and the purity (then: Harnack is not on the exact and rigorous line, if I am right …) … Instead Rudolf Schnackenburg (the other name indicated in your “short introduction”), following what wrote Pope Ratzinger, was “the right source” (= the “right name”… Sorry, here I become near … “ultrapapist”) and then we can think that “Ego Sum” (= Jesus Christ, the Son of God) was the “shape of energy” (emanated from “the Word Incarnate”) written on linen fibrils, perhaps in a mysterious “incarnate manner”… We have to use modern advanced controls, as you already know (from my own “SPM sermons”), I think that Giulio Fanti worked with Multi parametric mechanical measurements (= MPMM) just as a very interesting didactic work… In short: a good opportunity to improve our level of knowledges, but not yet “the last verdict” … and we are very far from that, as Hugh wrote [although, IMO, he exceeded in a pessimistic evaluation turning the data, as matter of fact, in a strange manner towards an incredible pro C14 1988 verdict! …]. — — — P. S. According to Benedict XVI, the dehellenization of Christianity has had three waves throughout history. In one of these (the second), Harnack was pushing for the simply return to the man Jesus and to his simple message, underneath the accretions of theology and, indeed, of hellenization: and thus it would be this simple message which would constitute, according to Harnack, the culmination of the religious development of humanity… — — Adolf von Harnack, in full Adolf Karl Gustav von Harnack (born May 7, 1851, Dorpat, Estonia, Russian Empire [now Tartus, Estonia]—died June 10, 1930, Berlin, Germany). >… Harnack’s most famous work, Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (1886–89; The History of Dogma), is a monument of liberal Christian historiography. >In this work, Harnack traced the origin and development of Christian dogma, which he understood to be the authoritative system of Christian doctrine that had formed by the 4th century AD. >His thesis was that Christian dogma in its conception and development is a work of the Hellenistic Greek spirit based on the Gospel of Jesus in the New Testament. >According to Harnack, the process begun at the Protestant Reformation—the overcoming of dogma by a recovery of the essence of the Gospel—should be completed, and the historical critical approach would achieve this. Harnack defended this position in his most popular book, Das Wesen des Christentums (1900; What Is Christianity?), which was the transcript of a course of lectures he had delivered at the University of Berlin. >Harnack’s other major works are Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur bis Eusebius (1893–1904; The History of Ancient Christian Literature) and Die Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten (1902; The Mission and Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries). He was the chief editor of a critical edition of The Greek Christian Authors of the First Three Centuries (1891– ). >He also published numerous monographs on the New Testament and on the doctrines and institutions of the ancient church. >In all these works, Harnack tried to show how the Gospel of Jesus, which in his view has nothing in common with authoritarian ecclesiastical statutes and doctrines, became embodied in the doctrines of the church. He also expressed the conviction that, if Christianity is to retain its power in the modern world, it must be freed from any connection with the dogmas of God and Christ with which it became identified to survive in the Hellenistic world. … Link: http://www.britannica.com/E Bchecked/topic/255617/Adolf von Harnack Instead regarding Schnackenburg I have found an italian article by Nobile Marco, “Recensione: Rudolf Schnackenburg, La persona di Gesù Cristo nei quattro vangeli”, published in Antonianum, 71/2 (1996) p. 357.

S. Performs an act brave and sensible, which implies that the problem around the type of relationship between the Jesus of history and faith, is a false problem. When searching for the historical identity of Jesus Christ, you have access to only the gospels. Now, these are undoubtedly the projection of a truly historical entity and identity, however incontrovertible that basis is available only in the mediation offered by the long and complex tradition of primitive communities and, ultimately, its crystallization editorial work of the evangelists. When, then, we want to answer the question “Who was Jesus Christ?”, We as the only source of the four gospels, which make theologically significant historical event that occurred two thousand years ago with the appearance of the Rabbi of Nazareth, who, no reaction hermeneutics of the early church, it would be a historical phenomenon among others.

Your error happened because damaged linen sample are less recognizable with respect good linen samples. So, you created a confusion… In other words: Cotton and Linen are more inclined to be in some manner “more similar” when textile materials are more “mechanical aged” (…and then too degraded textile fibrils turn in unknown/unrecognizable material…). This is an obvious fact and now you have to answer about my remark… Have you understood what I have just written? For example: we can describe the effects of “cottonization” on physical mechanical properties of flax fibers… You cannot write against Fanti in a wrong manner. For example: observing the figure A.2, at p.352 (of the book by Fanti and Malfi : “Sindone primo secolo dopo Cristo!”, published by Segno Ed., 2014) there is a curious description … In fact a right cross section for linen is not hexagonal, but pentagonal… Perhpas flax has a cross section polygonal, nominally hexagonal but with just as many pentagons and heptagons… And then there is a fact (= hexagonal instead of pentagonal) where myself and you can easily discuss… Instead you wanted to attack Fanti on his attempt to show that medieval date about Holy Shroud (results obtained in 1988) was a wrong result (and this about the entire relic. Here I don’t discuss particular theories = Lind and Antonacci, Robert Rucker, etc. But IMO the Shroud is not a “nuclear esoteric painting”…)… In any case C14 is not some sort of philosopher’s stone. The Chosen People of C14 does not exists [and I am curious about the future date forecast by Rucker.

The dynamic response of the tip includes the complex tip–surface interactions due to the surface properties. We found that conventional tapping mode had a limitation in the accurate set point control on soft and high adhesion surfaces. This study employed the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based AFM microcantilever characterization method to estimate the surface property with more reliable control. The POD extracted the dominant empirical modes of the AFM microcantilever during tapping and scanning on the surface. Also the corresponding eigenvalues represented the significance of the empirical modes and the characteristic features of the nanoscale surface property. This experimental approach can offer a new insight on the novel application of nanoscale surface property estimation in dynamic AFM applications. … ….","date":"2015-01-13","mins":"12:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"id":"comment-183195","author":"piero","post":"I believe that … it would have been interesting if Fanti had contralateral parallel fibrils also from Sudarium of Oviedo ….","date":"2015-01-14","mins":"6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"id":"comment-182554","author":"piero","post":"Hugh, I don’t answered in time … [= “A stitch in time saves nine”!…] Sorry.

He is an Italian prof. Eng. And I have no academic titles… There’s no disguising the fact that he was able to obtain the samples by Riggi and this action permitted him to do the subsequent experiments (etc. …). When you wrote “p. 102” you should had better specify in this manner: “of the old book” (or “year 2013” [= first italian edition], or “Rizzoli edition”) because in the new book (Ed. Segno, Italy, january 2014), at p. 102 there are other informations … In any case it seems to me that we should think more about the fact that after Raymond N. Rogers (although there are doubts about the exact origin of the samples of Rogers) also prof. Giulio Fanti gave “the hammer blows” to dismantle the uncomfortable C14 dating of 1988 … Obviously this is not a final verdict against the “medieval date” for the Shroud, but it is already a big step towards the revision of the meaning of what has been achieved in 1988.

Peggie, Sergei G. Kazarian Abstract: >The potential of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FTIR) imaging for the characterisation of the chemical components of paint cross sections from old master paintings was investigated. Three cross sections were chosen to cover a variety of the analytical problems encountered in samples from paintings. The binding medium and degradation products in a green paint sample from a fifteenth century Florentine painting were imaged, as well as a thin layer within a cross section from a fifteenth century German painting, and multiple thin surface coatings on a painting of the 1760s by Peter Romney. The application of chemometric methods for further analysis of the large data set generated for each sample was also explored. The study demonstrated the advantages of ATR FTIR imaging, which allowed images to be obtained with high spatial resolution (ca. 3–4 μm) without the need to microtome the sample. The gain in sensitivity in detecting trace materials and the information derived from the location of these compounds in the sample was especially valuable, improving interpretation of the FTIR analysis and extending knowledge of the sample composition beyond that obtainable with other analytical techniques.

Urinary calculi formation is a complex process. Crystal retention is a key factor in urinary stone formation. That crystal retention can be caused by adhesion of crystals with the epithelial cells in the renal tubules. Kidney stones are aggregates of micron sized crystals that are commonly held together by an organic matrix (The most common inorganic crystalline components are: Calcium Oxalate monohydrate, Calcium Oxalate dihydrate, apatite, etc. Organic components include L cystine, Uric Acid and Urate salts …).

B.T.W.: Question: >What genes are related to primary hyperoxaluria? Answer: >Mutations in the AGXT and GRHPR genes cause primary hyperoxaluria. The breakdown and processing of certain sugars and protein building blocks (amino acids) produces a substance called glyoxylate. Normally, glyoxylate is converted to the amino acid glycine or to a compound called glycolate through the action of two enzymes, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, respectively. Mutations in the AGXT or GRHPR gene cause a shortage of these enzymes, which prevents the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine or glycolate. As levels of glyoxylate build up, it is converted to oxalate. Oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate deposits, which can damage the kidneys and other organs.

Bruno Barberis said that “it would be desirable for a new campaign of direct studies on the Cloth” (to be able to collect more data in order to build a complete map of physical, chemical and biological characteristics) and that “need a laboratory for the Shroud” … But how much does such a laboratory dedicated to the Shroud? Where is the provisional cost estimate? Would not it be better to start with the analysis of what has already been taken (in the past) before launching into adventures not yet well defined? — — — Today I have read that the new film “Ben Hur” (director = Timur Bekamambetov) start after 56 years and with the use of 15 cameras … Instead “Ben Hur” (1925) was the most expensive film of the silent era, possibly holding the record for over twenty years… A “laboratory dedicated to the Shroud” cost much, but (maybe) it can cost less than the movie “Ben Hur” … who knows …?.","date":"2015-04-08","mins":"11:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/07/this-unbelievable-claim/","cat":"video","title":"This Unbelievable Claim"},{"id":"comment-195744","author":"piero","post":"A “Laboratory dedicated to the Shroud” can cost much.
