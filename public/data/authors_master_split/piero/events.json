[{"id":"comment-149883","author":"piero","post":"Dear Dan, I am curious to read the PDF file. — — Now I have a question. And this is …. An unsolved problem of Archaeological Chemistry : the Shroud/tablecloth hypothesis (formulated by R. And J. Jackson) and inherent lack of chemical evaluations using adequate scientific tools… Yesterday I have reread an old paper by Rebecca and John Jackson : “The Jewish and Early Christian History of the Turin Shroud”. They proposed that the Shroud of Turin, besides being the possible burial cloth of Christ, also served as the tablecloth for the Lord’s Supper. The double usage for the Turin cloth unified two very different liturgical traditions associated with the Mass… : the altar/sacrifical tradition and the Lord’s Supper/meal tradition. They presented a possible evidence found directly on the Shroud itself for the tablecloth hypothesis… Cheroset is eaten using green herbs, then dipping stains might fall onto thr linen and then they also indicated the Gospel (John 13:26), because “dipping is mentioned in the Gospel” (when Jesus offers a little slice of bread, dipped into the wine, to Judas). They discovered drip patterns, adjacent to the legs of the frontal image. Considering the final drip spot at the end of a central linear pattern found at the midpoint of the Shroud, they saw that this drip spot happened to fall within the thermal discoloration zone of the 1532 fire. Also they saw that part of this spot was charred black (obviously by the 1532 fire). Now the problem to solve [after the restore operation (year 2002), etc., etc.] is connected with the pattern of drips found on the Shroud : Is it possible to know (using Raman controls, CFM, etc.) the truth about the origin for these stains ? Are we sure that these drip patterns went into the Shroud before the body and blood images ? Where are our conjectures about useful advanced controls ? Are these controls an useless waste of time or not ? ———————————————————————— In their work the Jacksons indicated that: – Cheroset was a mixture of red wine, nuts and apples. – Cheroset in Passover liturgy symbolizes the nortar that the Israelite slaves used in the construction of bricks for the Pharaoh’s building projects, – Cheroset is a vital element in the Passover “Seder” Liturgy and cannot be deleted or even replacet with another food item [Abarbanel Haggadah, Mesorah Publishers, p. 121) ———————————————————————— Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charoset >Charoset, haroset, or charoses (Hebrew: חֲרֽוֹסֶת [ḥărōset]) is a sweet, dark colored paste made of fruits and nuts eaten at the Passover Seder.

Correlations between the Judaic sources and the Holy Shroud of Turin (Tuesday, August 29, 2000) Link: https://www.shroud.com/orvieto.htm Second: The least squares fitting algorithm is the most commonly used algorithm in Raman spectroscopy.

There is an analogy with “our problem” : the scholarly ambiguities of Descartes illustrate how high the difficulties were : a propagation of light “within an instant” : a very short moment? or an instantaneous phenomenon? In the “Dioptrique” Descartes seems to conclude in favour of an instantaneous propagation (a duration that would be independent of the distance)… … But in a letter to Mersenne he wrote: “I declare contradictory that an infinite velocity may occur in Nature” Source : Costabel, 1978: “La propagation de la lumière sans trasport de matière de Descartes à Huygens”, in Roemer et la vitesse de la Lumière, Paris, Vrin. Creativity and Technology in Experimentation. I understand that an event open to the public in Rome (next workshop at La Sapienza University) is not an Analytical Laboratory and also direct confrontations of scholars having different views is not a Lab team work… Cellulose is synthesized in plant at the cell membrane by an ordered synthase complex by polymerization of glucose residues using beta glycosidic bonds. Nanometer thick crystalline microfibrils have high tensile strength and make up the fundamental structural unit in plant cell walls. There is also a matrix of other polysaccharides that cross link the microfibrils using hydrogen bonding. Then see also the question of “Hydrogen bonding plane”. If I am right Hydrogen bonding play a role in linen material as : – Intramolecular Hydrogen bonding – Intrasheet Hydrogen bonding – Intersheet .Hydrogen bonding. High resolution microscopy provided evidence for the presence of single crystal microfibrils. The nano crystalline cellulose (NCC or CNC) usage as reinforcement in biodegradable polymeric systems is a relatively new field in Nanotechnology … The type of nano crystals obtained from wood have similar properties to carbon nanotubes (CNT) such as stiffness and tensile strength. Their dimension is 2 5 nm x 150 300 nm … The axial modulus of crystalline cellulose is near 150 G Pa which is greater than Kevlar (130 G Pa). Using AFM techniques on linen fibrils we can detect something about structural features and morphology of ancient fibrils is different with respect modern fibrils. AFM force–displacement curves can be obtained by applying a vertical force in direction of CNC diameter (transverse direction). The mechanical properties of CNC (and, for example, mica) are known to be anisotropic. But here I never wrote something about transverse elastic modulus (= differences) or readily accessible surface of strain distorted tilt and twist regions… If the linen fibrils treated with alpha particles are more brittle, then the results obtained from three point (=3 P) bending tests (… or from AFM nanomechanical mapping) will be different with respect the untreated linen material. We can easily measure these differences using the 3 P bending test (or with AFM nanomechanical mapping) Also AFM 3 P bending tests on fibrils can solve in part our burning thirst of knowledge.

I have only found the following link: https://philosophynow.org/issues/93/The Science Delusion by Rupert Sheldrake What puzzles me are some strange statements that we can read in the Web … See for example the following words by Sheldrake: >Morphic resonance involves the transfer of information across space and time. It might be possible to develop information transfer systems, with a global memory, which would work without all the normal paraphernalia of satellites, wires, booster stations etc. I have already designed experiments in which a pin code could be transmitted from London to New York without any conventional means of communication.

Critics cite a lack of evidence for morphic resonance and an inconsistency of the idea with data from genetics and embryology, and also express concern that popular attention from Sheldrake’s books and public appearances undermines the public’s understanding of science http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert Sheldrake If I am right in my readings, Sheldrake is scientific – at least in many respects – but his theory is wrong.

You mentioned Penrose, so… I can write few lines about a known book by Penrose. I have found the description of Quanglement, alias quantistic information, and the parametric conversion for the couple of entangled photons (If I am right Sciama [1926 1999] has strongly influenced Roger Penrose, who dedicated his book “The Road to Reality” to Sciama’s memory). … That phenomenon happens when a photon (produced by a laser) enters in a particular crystal (= non linear) and there is a conversion in a couple of photons. This couple of photons is entangled in several ways and the sum of their moments must be equal to the moment of the incident photon and also their polarizations are connected (in EPR manner)… Penrose described a phenomenon that happens in a particular experiment… and illustrated the transmission of an image through quantistic effects… I don’t know where (exactly) this can lead if in the case of the speculations (about the origin of the Image on the Shroud) if you also add the concept of Superworld (see for example what was able to sketch prof. Zichichi), etc. … A planet in another Galaxy? or … In the Paradise? or … into the Hell?

It supports and ensures research collaboration between them by launching and managing different types of project calls. Within the EMRP Call 2012 “Metrology for Industry”, the joint research project (JRP) entitled “Multidimensional Reflectometry for Industry” (x D Reflect) was submitted by a consortium of 8 National Metrology Institutes (NM Is) and 2 universities and was subsequently funded. The general objective of x D Reflect is to meet the demands from industry to describe the overall macroscopic appearance of modern surfaces by developing and improving methods for optical measurements which correlate with the visual sensation being evoked. In particular, the project deals with the “Goniochromatism”, “Gloss” and “Fluorescence” properties of dedicated artifacts, which will be investigated in three main work packages (WP). Two additional transversal WP reinforce the structure: “Modelling and Data Analysis” with the objective to give an irreducible set of calibration schemes and handling methods and “Visual Perception”, which will produce perception scales for the different visual attributes. Multidimensional reflectometry involves the enhancement of spectral and spatial resolution of reference gonioreflectometers for BRDF measurements using modern detectors, conoscopic optical designs, CCD cameras, line scan cameras, and modern light sources in order to describe new effects like sparkle and graininess/coarseness.

My words are based also on the fact that we have not even yet seen the publication of a report on Raman controls of the year 2002. Here an example of AFM controls: Quantitative Mapping of the Elastic Modulus of Soft Materials with Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM AFM Modes by Maxim E. Dokukin and Igor Sokolov Abstract >The modulus of elasticity of soft materials on the nanoscale is of interest when studying thin films, nanocomposites, and biomaterials. Two novel modes of atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been introduced recently: Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM. Both modes produce distribution maps of the elastic modulus over the sample surface. Here we investigate the question of how quantitative these maps are when studying soft materials. Three different polymers with a macroscopic Young’s modulus of 0.6–0.7 G Pa (polyurethanes) and 2.7 G Pa (polystyrene) are analyzed using these new modes. The moduli obtained are compared to the data measured with the other commonly used techniques, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), regular AFM, and nanoindenter. We show that the elastic modulus is overestimated in both the Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM modes when using regular sharp probes because of excessively overstressed material in the samples. We further demonstrate that both AFM modes can work in the linear stress–strain regime when using a relatively dull indentation probe (starting from ∼210 nm). The analysis of the elasticity models to be used shows that the JKR model should be used for the samples considered here instead of the DMT model, which is currently implemented in Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM modes. Using the JKR model and∼240 nm AFM probe in the Peak Force QNM mode, we demonstrate that a quantitative mapping of the elastic modulus of polymeric materials is possible. A spatial resolution of ∼50 nm and a minimum 2 to 3 nm indentation depth are achieved.

In this work, we review two of such methods, namely contact resonance AFM (CR AFM) and torsional harmonics AFM (TH AFM).

Then, a case study is presented in which we report the mechanical characterization using both CR AFM and TH AFM of polyaniline and polyaniniline doped with nanodiamond particles tablets prepared by a pressing process. We determined the indentation modulus values of their surfaces, which were found in fairly good agreement, thus demonstrating the accuracy of the techniques. Finally, the determined surface elastic moduli have been compared with the bulk ones measured through standard indentation testing.

Bruno Barberis (Director of the International Center of Sindonology) The title of his speech includes three of the same words (= past, present and future) used in the past Symposium of Villa Gualino (Turin, March 2000). But, despite the years (14 years !), there is not yet the right level of analyses (= AFM, CFM, SNOM and Raman). Only Giulio Fanti was able to do something with Raman and ATR FTIR. But this is not enough ! … I believed that advanced microscopies can solve several problems and points remained obscure (f.e. : identificaion of the exact composition for T Ls [= thin layers] on linen fibrils involved in BIF = Body Image Formation). But I was not able to persuade / convince anyone to analyze the treated linens (experiments). 2 – We can see that interesting problems about Oviedo’s Cloth are investigated by large patrol of spanish researchers (= “Shroud of Turin and Sudarium of Oviedo”). Twenty years ago I was happy to see the points of congruence between the Shroud and Sudarium, and now… What is the “New Coincidence between Shroud of Turin and Sudarium of Oviedo” ? What is your opinion ? 3 – Pollen on the Shroud of Turin The trace left by anointing and embalming by M. Boi (University of the Balearic Islands), that is an expert in Palynology, which is the science that studies pollen. That could be a great intervention, we have to pay attention… because this study can be an extremely interesting work. — — The pollen exine, which is the outer layer of the grain, is composed of sporopollenin… Using the AFM techniques we can control the pollen adhesion to linen (and oil of embalming, etc.), etc., and AFM observations can reveal the level of pollen erosion. Under : http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/wall I have found an interesting explanation : >In addition to the purely mechanical function of the exine in protecting the reproductive cells from environmental injury, exine sculpturing plays an important role in attachment to insect pollinators and adhesion to the stigmatic surfaces; while wind pollinated species including many grasses and tree species often lack elaborate structure and appear smooth. … … And what is the difference about exine and intine ? >Beneath the exine, which is defined by the presence of one or two basal nexine layers, a second major wall layer surrounds the pollen grain protoplasm termed the intine. While the exine is composed of sporopollenin, a complex and highly resistant biopolymer containing fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics and carotenoids, the intine is largely composed of pectin and cellulose. … — — Now the problem : How can change over the centuries the material of pollen? — — A previous Boi’s report (Valencia 2012) clearly highlights that the pollen is proof that the shroud, which is kept in Turin, was a winding sheet and was used according to rituals common in the Middle East over a thousand years ago. B.T.W. : Under the address : http://extension.uned.es/actividad/7018 I have found another work by Marzia Boi (Universitat de les Illes Balears), here the title : “Sábana Santa de Turín y Sudario de Oviedo: pruebas científicas del crimen de Jesús de Nazaret”. So … If Max Frei made no attempt to distinguish between anemophilous and entomophilous pollen material, meanwhile, forensic science has progressed. In my previous intervention I remembered that is important to record the nature of pollen grains, the we were not able to deepen the question… If the pollen grains are powdery, dust like, this is an indication about wind pollination. Usually pollen grains are sticky in insect pollinated flowers. So we have to control what are the levels of viscoelasticity and adhesion … I have several doubts about the precision of that control, after the centuries and aging… In my opinion that work is not a nonsensical control and I am still curious about that unsolved question. 4 – In my opinion Giulio Fanti author of the intervention : Optical features of flax fibers coming from the Turin Shroud was able to do something using PLM (= Polarized Light Microscopy) and not with SPM … But I am still curious to follow what are the interesting observations. For now we can imagine something. For example: it is possible to show something about the ancient treatment = the beaten linen fibrils observed in optical field (PLM) … or : Was he able to measure the Viscoelastic Properties through “calibrated optical observations” ?

Also the resurrection in “another universe” (“multiverse”?) seem to be a sort of mocking result… because this new universe can be uncomprehensible for us. This seems to be near a sort of “recycled buddhism” = a rebirth, not in this poor world, but in another universe that can be a bit unknown (So … Is that “universe” the Purgatory?

Jesus saved the souls of the Purgatory and this Face is the result of our perception … but we are not yet able to understand the true meaning?). Probably it is better what the Christian Tradition taught, with three different cases : Paradise, Purgatory and Hell… In my opinion we cannot try to compute, microscopically or macroscopically, the power of God Father when He (…with and through the Holy Spirit) resurrected from the death His Son… This is a religious question and (IMO) atoms, nuclear particles, quarks or strings are far from that problem… In any case I am curious to see what kind of results will be obtained from true advanced controls… We can also discuss whether the body has passed through a phase of dematerialization perhaps involving the formation of antimatter or new states of matter, the non ordinary states (with very short life span). But the question for the moment is only completely theoretical. In principle I am opposed to this idea of dematerialization with transient phases.

See also: the eucharistic miracle of Turin in 1453 and that of August 18, 1996 while Pope Bergoglio was at that time bishop of Buenos Aires … Here the text: >At seven o’clock in the evening on August 18, 1996, Fr. Alejandro Pezet was saying Holy Mass at a Catholic church in the commercial center of Buenos Aires. As he was finishing distributing Holy Communion, a woman came up to tell him that she had found a discarded host on a candleholder at the back of the church. On going to the spot indicated, Fr. Alejandro saw the defiled Host. Since he was unable to consume it, he placed it in a container of water and put it away in the tabernacle of the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament. On Monday, August 26, upon opening the tabernacle, he saw to his amazement that the Host had turned into a bloody substance. He informed Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, who gave instructions that the Host be professionally photographed. The photos were taken on September 6. They clearly show that the Host, which had become a fragment of bloodied flesh, had grown significantly in size. For several years the Host remained in the tabernacle, the whole affair being kept a strict secret. Since the Host suffered no visible decomposition, Cardinal Bergoglio decided to have it scientifically analyzed. >On October 5, 1999, in the presence of the Cardinal’s representatives, Dr. Castanon took a sample of the bloody fragment and sent it to New York for analysis. Since he did not wish to prejudice the study, he purposely did not inform the team of scientists of its provenance. One of these scientists was Dr. Frederic Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], the well known cardiologist and forensic pathologist. He determined that the analyzed substance was real flesh and blood containing human DNA. … … >… ..Two Australians, journalist Mike Willesee and lawyer Ron Tesoriero, witnessed these tests. Knowing where sample had come from, they were dumbfounded by Dr. Zugiba’s testimony. Mike Willesee asked the scientist how long the white blood cells would have remained alive if they had come from a piece of human tissue, which had been kept in water. They would have ceased to exist in a matter of minutes, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied. The journalist then told the doctor that the source of the sample had first been kept in ordinary water for a month and then for another three years in a container of distilled water; only then had the sample been taken for analysis. Dr. Zugiba’s was at a loss to account for this fact. There was no way of explaining it scientifically, he stated. Only then did Mike Willesee inform Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!] that the analyzed sample came from a consecrated Host (white, unleavened bread) that had mysteriously turned into bloody human flesh. Amazed by this information, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied, “How and why a consecrated Host would change its character and become living human flesh and blood will remain an inexplicable mystery to science—a mystery totally beyond her competence.” Dr. F. Zugibe was a well known sindonologist… Link: http://www.loamagazine.org/nr/the main topic/eucharistic miracle in buenos.html >a journalist reported that miracles had been more than one.

M.

Rogers and Anna Arnoldi >… Postmortem body temperatures can reach 41ºC (Irvine, 2001), and steep temperature gradients would exist across the cloth as a result of the low thermal diffusivity of linen and theangular dependence of radiant heat flow from a nonmetallic surface (Gubareff et al, 1960). Then they concluded that temperature gradients will have a large effect on Maillard reaction rates and these combination of factors could produce a distribution of reaction products with the appearance of the image. I have pointed out (but a bit in a bad way. Sorry…) the question of urea. In short, I wanted to underline that the cadaveric amines (= putrescine and cadaverine, etc.) are the main candidates (if I am right in my readings) for the famous Maillard reaction indicated by Rogers and Arnoldi (and then we have to see what is the possible role for urea). Link: in https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers7.pdf. >Ever since the French chemist Louis Camille Maillard studied the metabolism of urea and kidney illnesses and published his thesis on the actions of glycerin and sugar on amino acids in 1913, the Maillard reaction has been a hot research topic. A review on browning reactions in dehydrated foods, which appeared in the first volume of Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, remains the most cited paper in that journal’s history. Link: http://blog.khymos.org/2012/06/04/maximizing food flavor by speeding up the maillard reaction/ Here what wrote Thibault Heimburger: >…Much has been made of ammonia being produced from sweat by hydrolysis of urea (H2 NCONH2). >CO2 (and some carbamates) is the other final product. I have not been able to find any sweat analysesthat showed urea as a major component. In any case, the reaction would be over in a few hours.Ammonia would leave a fog of color on the cloth, because it diffuses quite rapidly. >The image was notprimarily formed by ammonia. The fog around the nose and mouth looks to me like some ammonia was involved (“I think I see”). — — — I believe you have to read the document: by Ray Schneider http://www.shrouduniversity.com/Handouts/LLI Shroud Pt4 Skeptics&Image.pdf Here what is explained in the document (at p 59 of 65) by Ray Schneider: “Coronal Discharge” Professor Giulio Fanti believes that coronal discharge could explain the shroud image. – Giulio has done a lot of good science – Coronal Discharge requires very high voltages * * * * * * * * * * * * * And, at the end, some words about the strange theories… See for example: Here the words by Prof. Gonella during Villa Gualino’s Meeting (in 2000): “…As for the neutron bombardment, skipping any comment on the weird idea of a nuclear physics of Resurrection, as a nuclear physicist I can assure you that the exposure of cellulose to a fast neutron fluence big enough to cause the required enrichment in 14 C would play such a havoc with the hydrogen atoms to cause chemical changes visible to the naked eye (and this too can be easily checked). …” Here the words by Prof. Luigi Gonella (title = “Discussant’s contribution”) during the famous Meeting in Villa Gualino, Turin (in 2000): “…As for the neutron bombardment, skipping any comment on the weird idea of a nuclear physics of Resurrection, as a nuclear physicist I can assure you that the exposure of cellulose to a fast neutron fluence big enough to cause the required enrichment in 14 C would play such a havoc with the hydrogen atoms to cause chemical changes visible to the naked eye (and this too can be easily checked). …” So… It’s easily understandable that my old idea (written by myself in my intervention paper for Dallas 2005) to use the AFM controls and the SSNTD witnesses during adequate experimental simulations perhaps should have had also this reference (… thinkable as an authoritative reference) in the paper (a simple thing that I didn’t do, if I well remember…)… otherwise that idea was judged a simple and useless joke (and now I write this with reference what wrote Prof. Gonella). Unfortunately we have seen some recent interesting or strange papers (an example: Jeffrey Skurka…) where this argument (= AFM sperimental controls on irradiated samples with SSNTD as material witnesses regarding nuclear radiations) do not appear.

Aufl. 1892). Athenais war die geistvolle Tochter des heidnischen Philosophen Leontius, trat zum Christentum über, wurde als Gemahlin Theodosius’ II. Kaiserin Eudokia (421 – 441 oder 444) und endete, seit 450 Witwe, ihr Leben ca. 460 zu Jerusalem im Exil. Ihre Geschichte interessierte G. Um so mehr, als sie ihm “eine zweifache Metamorphose Griechenlands versinnbildlichte: den Übergang vom Heidentum in das Christentum und vom Hellenentum in das Byzantinertum”. So konnte er mit der Erzählung der Geschicke der Athenais wieder eine höchst anschauliche, lehrreiche Schilderung jenes Umwandlungsprozesses verbinden, der ihn, wie ähnliche andere Übergangsperioden, ausnehmend fesselte. — — 1882 Gregorovius published the monograph “Athenaïs, Story of a Byzantine Empress”, which is added to the translation of a song of her poem “Cyprian and Justina,” as it were “the first poetic treatment of the theme of the Faust legend” (3rd edition, 1892). Athenaïs was the spirited daughter of the pagan philosopher Leontius, converted to Christianity, was as the wife of Theodosius II, Empress Eudocia (421 441 or 444) and ended, since 450 widow, lives about 460 to Jerusalem in exile. — — Here another (vague) reference : Jannic Durand et Bernard Flusin, éd., Byzance et les reliques du Christ.

Both instruments belong to a family of microscopes broadly known as Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPM). The primary use of AFM is to quantitatively determine surface morphology at the nano scale … The sharpness of the tip is the key determinant in the resolution of AFM imaging. In addition to its imaging functions, AFM is also able to quantitatively measure the attractive and repulsive forces that exist between the sample and probe, as the cantilever is brought into contact with and then pulled away from the sample surface. — — — Here an interesting reference (= BIF analyses ! …) : Gibson, C.T., Watson, G.S., Mapledoram, L.D., Kondo, H. & Myhra, S.

Where are the useful inherent evaluations? The color strength of the dyed fabrics can be measured by using a spectrophotometer for D65 illuminant and an observer located at 10º… (Link: http://www.ihara us.com/theory.php?page=4 ) In order to evaluate the wettability of the polyamide woven fabrics, a water drop test can be applied by measuring the time for its complete absorption into the material. If you want to treat the surface of the polyamide samples with plasma (and you have to perform this operation before to do the dyeing process!), then you can see that there is a significant change due to chemical etching, which tends to create oxidized species on the surface of the polyamide fibers. Then the polyamide fiber changes the nature from hydrophobic to hydrophilic which is key point for the adsorption of aqueous dye solutions. But I do not believe this was the phenomenon involved for the Imprint generation, what happened in Jospice Hospital is (probably) another thing… The increase in roughness (for plasma treated samples) can be better understood when AFM images are compared with the polyamide material treated (with “cold dyeing” process) without plasma discharge. We can also proceed toward the Identification of Coloring Compounds. In my opinion there are three main ways to work, thus in order to observe: Chemical structures from spectroscopic analyses Chemical structures of the samples controlled using AFM techniques. Chemical structures of the extracted dye.

Now I ask : How is possible to further simplify the question? Here a rough attempt. First of all we have to sketch an analysis in order to define the presumed “Stochastic + deterministic process”. So … We can try to consider two main aspects of the presumed process: 1) random walk of cadaveric emissions = stochastic process or not ? 2) constrained arrival on sheet of cadaveric emission by IR and subsequent chemical attraction by reactive sugars = deterministc process or not ? Is it possible to simplify the problem in this manner in order to study the probabilistic model ? What is the probability level of reaction for cadaveric emissions on linen sheet ? This is a key point. What do you expect to see on linen if the level of cadaveric emissions is low ? — — In any case we need a very simple experiment in order to answer the question : How is the gradient on linen ? In the past, discussing the issue, I indicated a very simple experiment in order to simulate (with a model) the presumed action of cadaveric gases on linen. We have to start with a linen treated with Lead Acetate (White) submitted to H2 S (gas) in order to obtain the Pb S (Black). I have not a Lab at disposal… I think that Colin Berry (a chemical scientist) is able to do that easy work, an experiment that seems to be useful to show the mechanism of a reactive gas on a treated textile. — — At the end I want to remember that we have to examine the problem in a careful manner, step by step. I don’t endorse the cadaveric gas theory, simply I want too see what happens on similsindonic linen. Was Allan Mills able to do that ? I saw what appeared in the book by Knight and Lomas and, frankly, that image is too far from the Shroud! — — Here an example for the IR action on cadaveric emissions (rough simulation): if we are not able to show what happens with a plastic dolly (filled with hot water) coated with an adequate thickness of wet (= sweat + cadaveric amines) skin and covered with linen sheet, then we have to try with another object or another system.

To understand the question, see also, for example under : http://blog.modernmechanix.com/the amazing motor that draws power from the air/ or http://www.meridian int res.com/Energy/ES Motors.pdf Now … I want to ask : Is it possible to use that source of energy (used for corona discharge motors) in order to show what are the results obtained on linen sheet following the system by Giulio Fanti = CD (= corona discharge) ? I asked to prof. Fanti, but he is too busy and he has not yet answered to me. — — I am a bit skeptic about the presumed electric origin for the famous Image … B.T.W. : few days ago and few kilometers from Biella (… and not in India … !), a guard was bowled over by a lighting bolt ! The name of that (living) person (with the hand nailed by that bolt) is Salvatore Galizia, 37 years (institute = Group Service 2000) … There is a link.
