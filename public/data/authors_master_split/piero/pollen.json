However (putting aside the jokes) a scientific study should take into account what we can say with the Calculus of Probability. Then there is another thing to consider: there is not yet a careful comparison with the DNA found on another famous relic: the Sudarium of Oviedo. — — However, as I have already had occasion to emphasize in a previous message, a “marginal difference of DNA” (ie: not for the DNA of the Person who was in contact with the ancient lignocellulosic materials) does not imply anything about the authenticity of the two relics! And, before to finish with the “complex topic DNA”, I still have doubts about the possibility to assign a “rough date” (even with an approximate dating) for the DNA of the people involved in the release of “genetic traces” and extraneous to that dead Man. This “dating of DNA” would help us to solve the problem regarding the contamination with foreign DNA, that is: whether it is a kind of ancient or modern contamination….","date":"2015-10-22","mins":"9:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/21/numerous-plant-species-and-human-lineages-identified-now-what/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Numerous Plant Species and Human Lineages Identified.
