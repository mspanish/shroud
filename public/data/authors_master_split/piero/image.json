In this study, the potential relationships between the microstructure and the surface properties of different cotton fibers are analyzed. This method is based on the analysis of adsorption of gaseous probes on solid surfaces. By measuring the retention time of probes into a column containing the fibers, thermodynamic surface characteristics of these fibers, in particular the dispersive component of their surface energy, and their surface morphological aspects, are determined.

In this paper we describe our effort to evaluate and fabricate the AFM arrays for the ESA Midas/Rosetta space mission.

I thought wrong, in a moment of memory loss … I didn’t remembered and the I merged two different kind of products: graphite and carbon fibres in one …that doesn’t exist… In any case graphite is the final stage of the carbonization process. Graphite may be considered the highest grade of coal, just above anthracite and alternatively called meta anthracite, although it is not normally used as fuel because it is difficult to ignite. Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite Instead there are three different organic precursor materials used to produce carbon fibers : rayon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and pitch… I continue to be skeptic about the “quality of black charcoal”. You claim there are ordered layers (= microcristalline graphite) after “deep schorching of linen”. Here instead I doubt that linen fibrils can turn into ordered graphitic structures (= network solid) because I remember that carbon fibres, etc. Were mainly obtained from acrylic materials (= PAN), etc. … Natural linens are not a pure chemical material like acrylic fibers and contain different quantities of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignins. Who is right? Perhaps the truth can be shown only controlling the results obtained from adequate experiments on linen fibrils (building an interesting “degradation scale” and testing inherent materials under SEM and AFM). For example: we can try to control what was previously done by Dr. Mario Cappi (Turin, 1998) and others. Is that useless? It depends on what was the nature of linen samples (= natural linen without bleaching products or not, etc.). — — — Here a bitter note regarding your interesting furfural polymers: yesterday I was not lucky in my search with Google… and today I have to cut wood (to burn) for myself… — — Using SPM controls we can detect interesting signature of aging. See also: – Morphology – Polymer decomposition by slow oxidation – Cellulosic degree of depolimerization. Eng. Fanti and Dr. Malfi were able to do tensile measurements for monitoring of mechanical properties. Young’s modulus was obtained by destructive mechanical testing method. But we should avoid to destroy linen samples (coming from the Shroud) and also we have to distinguish 1532 fire damage and heating effects with respect signature of aging (and that can be obtained choosing adequate areas with a preliminar mapping). … Another question : apparently there are no experiments or works on dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) for determining the modulus over a wide temperature range. That problem can be solved using (for inherent tests) materials utilised during the building of the “scale of degradation”… — — — Here three lines for Mario: I don’t believe in strange nuclear irradiations of linen fibrils (taking apart natural radiation background !). But… How to exactly measure crosslinking and scission effects due to (presumed) radiation damage, without AFM techniques? Perhaps we can add some control on material coming from exposure to excilamps… I hope that you will want to forgive me for this idea of control that is quite particular … — — — — Excilamps are the sources of incoherent UV and VUV radiation based on the non equilibrium radiation of exciplex or excimer molecules. Here another more detailed explanation: >Excilamps are a kind of gas discharge lamps radiating in UV or VUV spectral region due to the decomposition of excimer molecules (excited dimer – excimer, in the case of a molecule consisting of equal atoms, Ar2* for example) or exciplex molecules (excited complex – exciplex, in the case of a hetero nuclear molecule, Xe Cl* for example).

That material was very far from the modern values for their strength and modulus of elasticity (near 300 M Pa and 600 G Pa, respectively)… Max Fremery and Johann Urban developed a method to produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897. But, if I am right, modern production of carbon fibres started in 1959 at the Union Carbide Company. In any case I have also read that: >English chemist/physicist Joseph Swan experimented with a carbon filament incandescent light all the way back in 1860, and by 1878 had developed a better design which he patented in Britain. >On the other side of the Atlantic, Thomas Edison developed a successful carbon filament bulb, receiving a patent for it (#223898) in January 1880, before Lewis Latimer did any work in electric lighting… … And at Innventia, research activities have shown that it is possible to produce carbon fibres from lignin, which is a by product in a kraft pulp mill.

Although the particular questions connected with Textile Chemistry are not yet well explained (*) in your paper, however I agree with you about the importance of the studies by Rogers. *) See f.e. : – Rogers indicated the question of “erythrostarch” (= starch that turns red). – Pectin is a substance composed by pectic acid, that is (mainly) galacturonic acid, partly or completely esterified with methyl alcohol – etc. — — STARCH. The presumed fact that “no references to the use of starch in antiquity have been found” (paper by Fanti, Heimburger and others) seems to be a bit strange and incredible … Mc Crone actually observed wheat starch granules. Yes, he was able to work and, in that case, I believe him. He studied starch granules, and he reported the inherent properties in his Particle Atlas. (B.T.W.: Do you know these granules ?) In any case my name is not connected with Fanti, Botella, Di Lazzaro, Heimburger and Svensson. Yes, the study “Microscopic and Macroscopic Characteristics of the Shroud of Turin Image Superficiality” was an interesting attempt, but that work was not careful (speaking from the point of view of Textile Chemistry and Applied Microscopy …). So, I remained aloof from that “inconsistent work” (Sorry… Here no offence or personal affront !) claiming something without the required proofs (because they don’t used the advanced Microscopies = AFM, CFM …). Have you read the book : “Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood” (2001) by Oliver Sacks ? It is an autobiographical account of his early life in a family where curiosity and inquisitiveness were encouraged. Reading a page of this book we found the interesting comment about the discovery of the vision for the true atoms with the (Tungsten) tip of an Atomic Force Microscopy. Well… Why I have cited Oliver Sacks ? In 1998 I wrote about AFM (as a method to control the truth about the samples from the Shroud, see also : the 14 C tests of 1988) without the support of true controls, a forewarning with a vague image from the University of Pisa. Instead Ray Rogers indicated another kind of approach : ESCA (= Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis), in the paper “An Alternate Hypothesis for the Image Color”. But he pretty convincingly established the fact of a thin layer of starch impurities on the surface of the fibers. So… We have to show that presence (of starch) using the modern tools and that (perhaps) was not well appreciated by Fanti & other researchers. Theses guys (with all due respect to their academic qualifications) pointed the finger mainly toward the primary cell wall… Perhaps they are not familiar with the different properties of the different fractions of starch. So… What is your opinion ? When tested with iodine, normal soluble starch turns blue. Starch that is soluble only in hot water turns red. Do you agree on that information ? For example: I have read that erythrodextrin can be distinguished from other carbohydrates by its red color reaction with iodine. And I have found another information: >Starch is converted to erythro dextrin and dextrose by boiling with dilute mineral acids. If the boiling is prolonged the erythro dextrin is converted to dextrose… Source: http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook text/Exercises in Practical Physiological Chemistry 1000245717/45 [Exercises in Practical Physiological Chemistry by Sydney William Cole, 1927] There are three kinds of dextrins : amylo , erythro and achro ; the amylo and erythro dextrins giving a red or brownish colour with iodine solution, the achro dextrin being unaffected by this reagent. From Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrin ) we know that : >Dextrins are a group of low molecular weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch … In any case Rogers indicated us that higher molecular weight, hot water soluble starch is the last to wash out of a cloth and the reaction with iodine produces a red color… Where are the colored photomicrograph of red fibers ? Have you seen the interesting images ? Have you found the useful chemical proofs? Are you able to send us inherent pictures ? In your study there are no images… Why ? I believe that Colin Berry is able to show us the red fibers… Am I wrong in my idea ? How to estimate the exact composition of thin layers on linen fibrils ?

I believe you have to show us the results obtained from the controls on painted linens (…with ageing treatement and not). Here some example: 1 – “Progress in the application of ATR FTIR microscopy to the study of multi layered cross sections from works of art” by Adriana Rizzo Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry September 2008, Volume 392, Issue 1 2, pp 47 55 Date: 18 Apr 2008 Abstract >As a non invasive or micro invasive technique attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (ATR FTIR) microscopy is a valuable tool for the analysis of materials in works of art. An application for which it has received growing interest is in the analysis of paint cross sections. However, FTIR microscope configurations, objectives’ geometries and low spatial resolutions, and issues of sample preparation have often hampered the characterization of individual layers or features in cross sections. With the use of case studies, it is demonstrated here that an ATR FTIR microscope featuring a crystal of optimized geometry and a viewing capability feature allows characterization of individual layers, or areas within layers, of 10 μm thickness or less in single measurements. Of particular value is a remote aperturing feature which allows the analysis of selected areas within the contact footprint of the ATR crystal. Since the technique is non destructive, the same area can be analyzed by complementary microscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry was also used in some cases to corroborate the spectroscopic data. The analyses presented provided data which were important in informing art historical interpretation and conservation of the artworks examined Link: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2 Fs00216 008 2064 2# 2 ATR FTIR imaging for the analysis of organic materials in paint cross sections: case studies on paint samples from the National Gallery, London Marika Spring, Camilla Ricci, David A.

Here I want to turn for a moment in a boring guy… because I have seen that ATR FTR analyses don’t seem to affect much. Then … there is a famous example about the “scientific prevision” that can be useful to remember… Reminder: The data for light deflection observed during the eclipse (of the Sun) of 1919 were coming from two groups of measurements: one at Sobral (Brasil) and the other in the Prince’s Island. The first case furnished the following value = 1”, 98 + 0”,30 and the second indicated 1”,61+0”,30. But in 1923 William Wallace Campbell and Robert Julius Trurmper , published an article where the prevision of General Relativity (by Einstein) about stellar light deflection due to the mass of Sun were compared with a group of measurements taken during a total eclipse of Sun that happened in September 21, 1922. The theretical value foreseen by General Relativity was 1″,745, instead the experimental mean value found was equal to 1″,72 +/ 0″,11. Then the comparison turned to be a strong confirmation for the theorical value. Here few other lines (History of Science): early calculations done by E Instein in 1911 indicated a deflection value of 0″,87 (in 1911, Einstein wrote: “A ray of light going past the Sun would accordingly undergo deflexion to an amount of 4×10 6 = 0.83 seconds of arc.”), then a value near identical of that indicated in 1801 by Johann Georg von Soldner (1776 1833), a scientist who remained in the field of the Newton’s theory and also hypothesized that light was an heavy body subject to the diffusion from the solar mass. But in 1915 the newtonian idea was replaced by arguments based on space’s curvature and the estimation flowed into a value twice (= 1″,74) with respect the previous data. Unfortunately in 1914 and in 1916 there was the war period and in 1918 an attempt achieved by american researchers did not produced a sufficient amount of data … That is: at the end we must remember the famous phrase… “Carthago delenda est” !… Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests of general relativity Please, read the similar words under the paragraph: “Deflection of light by the Sun”: >… The first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere. The observations were performed in May 1919 by Arthur Eddington and his collaborators during a total solar eclipse,[12] so that the stars near the Sun could be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil and in São Tomé and Príncipe on the west coast of Africa.[13] The result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers. It made Einstein and his theory of general relativity world famous. When asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by Eddington and Dyson in 1919, Einstein famously made the quip: “Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway.”. … … and then now my hands are almost burning for impatience! But I have found another link: http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/eclipse/index.html Where we can read the following words: >In “Weird but True” Jamal Munshi reports: “Dr. F. Schmeidler of the Munich University Observatory has published a paper titled “The Einstein Shift An Unsettled Problem,” and a plot of shifts for 92 stars for the 1922 eclipse shows shifts going in all directions, many of them going the wrong way by as large a deflection as those shifted in the predicted direction! Further examination of the 1919 and 1922 data originally interpreted as confirming relativity, tended to favor a larger shift, the results depended very strongly on the manner for reducing the measurements and the effect of omitting individual stars. >So now we find that the legend of Albert Einstein as the world’s greatest scientist was based on the Mathematical Magic of Trimming and Cooking of the eclipse data to present the illusion that Einstein’s general relativity theory was correct in order to prevent Cambridge University from being disgraced because one of its distinguished members [Eddington] was close to being declared a “conscientious objector”. … … So we should conclude that a certain amount of tricks seems to be necessary to work with succeed in the field of Science… and the claim of that webpage is that they (= P. Marmet and C. Couture, Physics Department, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada) have shown “that no one can seriously claim that light is really deflected by the Sun.” !!! Really ??? and I have found another webpage, by V.N. Strel’tsov [Dubna, Russia] ( Link: http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/articles/3 5/Strel light.htm ), that reinforce these strange claims … Here the last words : >… a gravitational field does not influence on a light ray.

In any case cell walls are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin. So, firstly, we can try to hypothesize that Ar F VUV laser (= yellowish coloration) acts mainly on PCW and, after, we have to test this hypothesis (and then we can work with controls based on AFM techniques). Am I wrong in my idea? The Ar F laser (λ = 0.193 μm, 0.08 J per pulse, 12 ns) emits radiation in the VUV spectral region with smaller energy and shorter pulse duration than Xe Cl lasers. Observe the Figure n. 7 of the paper by DI Lazzaro, Murra and Santoni (link: http://www.frascati.enea.it/fis/lac/excimer/sindone/2012 16 ENEA.pdf). = “Microscope image of a single linen fiber colored after Ar F laser irradiation.” “The mechanical damage in the central part shows small pieces of colored primary cell wall on a colorless inner part of the fiber” (the average diameter of the fiber is 20 μm). Instead the Figure 9a shows a linen fabric after Ar F laser irradiation when it is illuminated with a UV lamp. >The area irradiated by the laser emits a much smaller blue fluorescence with respect to the linen fabric … If linen samples treated with Xe Cl laser (= brownish color) cannot be investigated in a careful manner with AFM techniques, then we should apply an “ultramicrotomy treatment” to the samples in order to know something of useful. But this kind of treatment (a destructive manipulation) seems to me a little bad choice… Regarding the thermal changes the authors stated that: >the linen region irradiated by the UV Xe Cl laser was heated up to 33 °C, while the linen irradiated by the VUV Ar F laser up to 25 °C. We can also try to consider – Figure 13a. Left: photo of the linen during Xe Cl laser irradiation. – Figure 13b. Left: photo of the linen during Ar F laser irradiation. And their text indicated also the same picture seen in infrared light. But I have some doubt regarding the exact temperature on lignin areas into the linen fibrils… Here what Cardamone underlined about Lignin: >…it exhibits plasticity and viscous flow. >As a thermoplastic resin, lignin congeals upon cooling, leaving hard, globular, dark deposits. We have not at disposal microscopical images (taken at high magnification) in order to verify the morphology in order to identify the possible presence of “hard, globular, dark deposits” (indicated by Cardamone).

Schafersman, Ph.D. I have just read the strange claims… Here some excerpt: >… Mc Crone frequently complained that anyone with a simple polarizing microscope … [… omitted words …] could easily see and identify the abundant (millions) of tiny red ocher pigment particles that coat all the fibers in the image and blood areas. >Undoubtedly, STURP members did see these abundant and colorful reddish particles on the Shroud image and blood fibers–but never on the Shroud non image fibers–but, against all reason and evidence, decided they were naturally occurring alkaline iron precipitates and then ignored them! >To this day, STURP members continue to ignore the pigment particles … >… Red ocher/iron oxide/hematite is easily identified by its color and by crossing the polarizing filters of the polarizing microscope and examining the refractive index of a particle.

Also I understand that you are not a scientist, however I’m curious to read your answer … —***— Today I have found another ATR FTIR study: “ATR FTIR as a thickness measurement technique for hydrated polymer on polymer coatings.” Here an excerpt from the abstract: >… We propose a new method, that is, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FTIR) to determine the relative thickness, combined with atomic force microscopy to calibrate the ATR FTIR measurements. This technique was successfully employed to determine the hydrated thickness of a series of crosslinked tetraglyme coatings on ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene substrates intended to reduce wear of acetabular cups in total hip replacements. The hydrated coatings ranged from 30 to 200 nm thick and were accurately measured despite the relatively high root mean square (RMS) roughness of the substrates, 20 35 nm (peak to peak roughness 55 100 nm). The calibrated ATR FTIR technique is a promising new method for measuring the thickness of many other polymer on polymer and hydrated coatings.

Dr. Raymond Rogers claimed to be able to work using the petrographic microscope (…then, unless Steven D. Schafersman is truly right in his remarks, Rogers was able to work!). Instead I don’t see the same scientific behavior for Dr. Colin Berry. But this seems to be turned as a lesser question with respect the interesting graphic presentations shown by Colin… It is for these reasons that I have mentioned the idea of checks to be carried out with the ATR FTIR technique, although I prefer the SPM way (and, in particular, the AFM techniques…).

However, that changed on September 9, 1915, when the famous scientist Nikola Tesla published an article entitled The Wonder World to be Created by Electricity. In it, he made the following astounding claim: …Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely and minutely arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high tension discharge… The term condenser is an older word for what we now know as a capacitor, or an electrical machine capable of storing energy. Tesla thought that the Ark generated static electricity by causing air to rub against curtains. This created static electricity which was then stored inside the Ark, turning the box into a giant Leyden Jar. Source: http://www.guerrillaexplorer.com/strange science/ark of the covenant lost technology/ 2) >… after his escape from Egypt, Moses ordered the construction of the Ark of the Covenant to house the tablets of stone on which were written the original “Ten Commandments”. Its construction is described in great detail in the book of Exodus and according to the Bible and Jewish legend it was endowed with miraculous powers including emitting sparks and fire and striking dead Aaron’s sons and others who touched it. It was basically a wooden box of acacia wood lined with gold and also overlaid on the outside with gold. The lid was decorated with two “cherubim” with outstretched wings. In 1915 Nikola Tesla, in an essay entitled “The Fairy Tale of Electricity” promoting the appreciation of electrical developments, proposed what seemed a plausible explanation for some of the magical powers of the Ark. He claimed that the gold sheaths separated by the dry acacia wood effectively formed a large capacitor on which a static electrical charge could be built up by friction from the curtains around the Ark and this accounted for the sparks and the electrocution of Aaron’s sons. >Recent calculations have shown however that the capacitance of the box would be in the order of 200 pico farads and such a capacitor would need to be charged to 100,000 volts to store even 1 joule of electrical energy, not nearly enough to cause electrocution. It seems Tesla’s explanation was appropriately named. Source: http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm So… Was the Ark of the Covenant a mysterious biblical piece of ancient technology ? What was the level of electrical knowledge in ancient times?

In IGC, a column filled with the solid sample to be investigated and a single gas (probe molecule) is injected. The aim of this characterisation technique is to determine the thermodynamic surface properties and surface morphological aspect of linen or/and cotton fibres. The surface characterisation by Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC) has been recommended by several papers. I have read that IGC method is the better method to determine the energetic properties of fibers than wetting technique … When you want to properly speak about the surface of that Ancient Linen, then you can try to do something using IGC, because testing the hypothesis of “natural production by stochastic process” you require (at least) some basic data … The basic tools for IGC are inexpensive, widely available and well suited for routine laboratory applications. Then the application of inverse gas chromatography seems to be easy, cheap and quick! Physiochemical data. You can consider dispersive component of surface energy and specific free energy in different experimental conditions. In 1936 Joel H. Hildebrand (who laid the foundation for solubility theory in his classic work on the solubility of nonelectrolytes in 1916) proposed the square root of the cohesive energy density as a numerical value indicating the solvency behavior of a specific solvent. Link: http://cool.conservation us.org/byauth/burke/solpar/solpar2.html Then Hildebrand solubility parameter for a pure liquid substance is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density. Here I presume you know the heat of vaporization, V(index m) = the molar volume, RT (from the Ideal Gas law [Liter atm / mole K] * K = [L atm / mol] ) and the energy of vaporization…. The partial pressures of all of the components in a mixture of real gases depend on the types of molecules and the temperature. At constant temperature, the internal energy of a mixture remains constant; however, the partial pressures of the components depend on their “fugacity.” In any case we can expect that the chemical researchers are able to work using the IGC … Unfortunately Rogers passed away in 2005. I can recommand you to read a polish paper (in english) published in 2008: “Inverse gas chromatography as a source of physiochemical data” (read, at the end of this message, the bibliographic reference) because IGC could be called a milestone in testing properties of liquid and solid materials. Typical units are hildebrand : 1 hildebrand = (1 cal )^1/2 (1 cm)^ 3/2 = 0.48888 (Mega Pascal)^1/2 The conventional units for the solubility parameter are (calories per cm3)^1/2, or: (cal)^1/2 (cm)^−3/2. Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildebrand solubility parameter See also : Hildebrand’s delta. Hildebrand solubility parameter is also known as three dimensional solubility parameters or HSP because Hansen proposed an extension of the Hildebrand parameter in order to estimate relative miscibility of polar and hydrogen bonding systems. There is a formula to calculate the distance (Ra) between Hansen parameters in Hansen space. Combining this with the interaction radius gives the relative energy difference (RED) of the system (the ratio Ra/R0, where R0 is a value called interaction radius that is given to the substance being dissolved). Historically Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) have been used in industries such as paints and coatings where understanding and controlling solvent/polymer interactions was vital. Over the years their use has been extended widely… Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansen solubility parameter For molecules whose heats of vaporization can be measured (… or calculated) one can determine the value of delta. There are three delta components (Hansen evaluation system): – dispersion – electrostatic – hydrogen bonding Do you know HSP (= Hansen Solubility Parameters) for myrrhoaloetic oils ? Perhaps you can try to do some easily experiments using methane or propane gas in your cooling room (both are explosive gases when mixed with air: warning, take care!!!). — — I have read that: the retention volume is calculated from the retention time and the partial pressure from the peak/step height. Since the retention volume represents the first derivation of the adsorbed amount, integration gives the isotherm. Perhaps other bloggers can contribute developing this argument… — — As previously wrote I don’t believe in oil’s presence. Years ago I have read something about an “Unguentum Apostolorum”. An oily, viscous substance, indicated by Norma Weller (now a deceased researcher), who also wrote something about an archaeological expert in ancient forms of burial and embalming… IGC can be employed to explore changes in surface energy (see, for example : Corona Discharge treatments, etc. …) IGC became very popular method for the measurement of physico chemical properties of solid materials. Therefore Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC), at infinite dilution, can be used to determine thermodynamic parameters of adsorption, such as free energy, enthalpy and entropy, as well as the dispersion component of surface free energy, and the interaction parameter. Then Inverse Gas Chromatography can be an useful tool to use in the case of experiments about thymol treatments (see: the inherent old claims)… I am curious to see what happens with natural linen samples, natural treated linen and modern/commercial linen samples. Perhaps they should show a smaller surface energy due to the additional treating ingredients and processing methods… In any case, I hope in your interesting answers… —————————— Bibliographic references : – D.R.

(2015) Real Time Visualization of Joint Cavitation. P Lo S ONE 10(4): e0119470. I believe that the same could happen to the question of determining the true age of the Shroud. Here the excerpts from the abstract: >Cracking sounds emitted from human synovial joints have been attributed historically to the sudden collapse of a cavitation bubble formed as articular surfaces are separated. Unfortunately, bubble collapse as the source of joint cracking is inconsistent with many physical phenomena that define the joint cracking phenomenon. Here we present direct evidence from real time magnetic resonance imaging that the mechanism of joint cracking is related to cavity formation rather than bubble collapse… etc. … >… Our results offer direct experimental evidence that joint cracking is associated with cavity inception rather than collapse of a pre existing bubble. These observations are consistent with tribonucleation, a known process … Link: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0119470 — — — I wonder what is the meaning about the fact that we want to speak about physical issues that we still do not know very well ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum teleportation ) mixed with certain ideas on Resurrection. I think that our Physics has some way to go before to speak about certain ideas of dimensional change with simultaneous transport in other dimensions… I hope that the required improvement of useful physical knowledges will be obtained with the same speed of that which come from the progress deriving from the use of an instrument: Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). In other words, see the study: “Comment on AMS02 results support the secondary origin of cosmic ray positrons” by Roberto A. Lineros April 14, 2015 arxiv:1504.03261 under the address: https://www.dmhunters.org/?p=12252 >Recently Blum, Katz and Waxman have claimed that the flux of high energy cosmic ray (CR) positrons near Earth that has been measured with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) aboard the International Space Station can be produced in the collisions of Galactic CR protons and nuclei with the ambient matter in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM).Their claim was based on an alleged “robust upper limit to the positron flux” which neglected the energy loss of e+’s in the ISM. Inclusion of this energy loss, however, yields a much smaller upper limit, which excludes secondary production in the ISM by the Galactic cosmic rays as the main origin of the CR e^+ flux above 10 Ge V. — — — The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS 02) is a state of the art particle physics detector designed to operate as an external module on the International Space Station. It will use the unique environment of space to study the universe and its origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter while performing precision measurements of cosmic rays composition and flux. The AMS 02 observations will help answer fundamental questions, such as “What makes up the universe’s invisible mass?” or “What happened to the primordial antimatter?” — — Then AMS and AFM are the two different ways to know this World… B.T.W., here what I have found in a new health field: >Nanodentistry is an emerging field with significant potential to yield new generation of technologically advanced clinical tools and devices for oral healthcare. Nanoscale topology and quantitative biomechanical or biophysical analysis of dental surfaces are of significant interest. In particular, using Atomic force microscopy techniques—diseases such as dental caries, tooth hypersensitivity, and oral cancer can be quantified based on morphological, biophysical and biochemical nanoscale properties of tooth surface itself and dental materials or oral fluids such as saliva. An outlook on future “nanodentistry” developments such as saliva exosomes based diagnostics, designing biocompatible, antimicrobial dental implants and personalized dental healthcare is presented… Don’t you want to think to improve the health?

For example: Our Lord Jesus Christ had a foster father: St. Joseph. However: where is the tomb of St. Joseph? Recently I read a short service on the ancient cult of St. Joseph in Palestine. Along with the article was a picture of the so called Tomb of the Right or of St. Joseph (which exists at the convent of the Sisters of Nazareth), the text was also quoted an ancient document called Judeo Christian “Historia Josepi”. According to this ancient report the death and glorification of St. Joseph took place right in the place where according to tradition Jesus revealed his “secret doctrine”, ie on Mount Olivet … The Dominican Milan Isidoro Isolano inserted the History of St. Joseph in his “Summa de donis St. Joseph”, printed in Pavia, in 1522. And in that work the story of Joseph’s life is attributed to Jesus himself, who would confided to the disciples on the Mount of Olives. Isidoro Isolano, who wrote the Summa of the gifts of St. Joseph, said that there will come a time when you will discover riches enclosed in St. Joseph. The Gospel of St. Matthew informs us that the death of Christ, “the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints who had died, resurrected. Coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many “… So: St. Joseph was among them? Another question: the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother of Jesus, is seen by some as the dying and then resurrected and went to heaven. Others (here I refer to one of the many responses given by Our Lady in Medjugorje) seem to deny that Mary is dead! Then: the Blessed Virgin Mary was dead or simply “asleep”? Some theologians, although the precise address expressed years ago by Pope Wojtyla, seems still debating the issue … — — — After these notes, however, I would not be passed to a heretic … St. Joseph by the unanimous opinion of the theologians and the teaching of Blessed Pius IX (Decree Quemadmodum Deus, December 8, 1870), Leo XIII (enciclica Quamquam pluries, August 15, 1889) and Pius XI (speech of 21 April 1926) exceeds dignity in any other saint of the Old and New Testament Baptist (though John the Baptist died a martyr, shedding his blood, and therefore there is no comparison) and Apostles included. Make faith the true marriage of St. Joseph with the Blessed Virgin Mary, the high paternity exercised against Jesus Christ, the extraordinary mission leader and guardian of the Holy Family, unsurpassed participation and knowledge of the divine plan of salvation I don’t put myself against the Truth of the Faith, but I see that some mysteries still seem to remain unresolved. Should we add mystery to the Mysteries? I do not think this is the right way to go toward the Truth. — — — Bibliography: Summa de donis sancti Joseph. – “Titre” : En, lector ingenue, novum opus… Summa, in quatuor secta partes, de donis sancti Joseph, sponsi beatissimae Virginis Mariae ac patris putativi Christi Jesu… [aedita a fratre Isidoro de Isolanis.] – “Au fol. 101” : Papiaeque impressa, apud Jacob Paucidrapium, M.D.XXII., tertio cal.

But now I do not remember well (ie: exactly) what was the result he had obtained, however (if I’m not mistaken) Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro argued that the phenomenon Resurrection (seen in its concrete manifestation, in textile fibers) has had a speed that is connected to that of the Light … and up here we can also agree and try to deepen ourselves the problem (which is related to the formation of the surface layer on linen fibrils, the same layer that after aging turns into the “ghost”, a material that can fall … and of which I have spoken in an other message [linked to the strange “gopic hand test” = a vibrational test] that you can easily read). Although these speculations are a bit strange in the eyes of the profane (see, for example, the harsh criticism of the “sins” made by “Shroudology” that is present in the now famous book Nicolotti, published in Italy by Einaudi), I think that might be interesting. To improve the calculations we should also keep in mind the speed of reaction to the light (of the excimer laser) of the material present at the surface characteristics of the fibrils. That is, we can not say that the chemical reaction is instantaneous because it requires a certain amount of time (little, IMO. In any case there is a proportionality with respect the power. And then see the exact energy threshold to overcome…). The same Dr.Paolo Di Lazzaro has highlighted the question of the latent image (ie: the imprint, produced with a certain wavelength, may develop after a certain period of exposure to air …), so that the B.I.F. Problem seems to be even more complex. So you have to identify the points on which to pin power. For example: I have found what seems to be a problem related to the interaction of light energy with natron and calcite (and iron oxides, dusts). Is that phenomenon the possible explanation about the particular “fog result” of the Image ? I don’t know, I have some doubt. We require calculations and more exact experiments. — — I confess that I see myself a little uncomfortable with these “dogmatic assumptions” (= the Light was the force that depicted the image on linen sheet surface…) and therefore I stress that I would prefer only to see reality as it appears (= under the controls of advanced microscopy), rather than launches into specific (…and interesting) conjectures that (perhaps) can turn into pitfalls… Any comment? For example: what happened with the light acting on the calcite crystals and natron that were present on the cloth? These problems do not appear to have been taken into account in the interesting research conducted by Di Lazzaro. — — Maybe you can guess that a really sudden dimensional change (a sort of “dimensional transfer”, with a breaken simmetry…) can produce certain effects on branes.

The mineralogy of the Site 1256 carbonate veins is therefore determined from their Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios, which reveal two distinct groups (Fig. F1; Table T1). The compact calcite structure can incorporate the small Mg cation, whereas aragonite has a larger cation site and favors accommodation of the larger Sr cation (Deer et al., 1992). Samples with Sr/Ca ratios less than ~0.2 mmol/mol are classified as calcite, and those with Mg/Ca ratios of less than ~2.5 mmol/mol are classified as aragonite (Table T1; Fig. F1). The remaining samples, with intermediate compositions (Sr/Ca >0.2 mmol/mol and Mg/Ca >2.5 mmol/mol), are interpreted to be aragonite calcite mixtures, which were homogenized during hand picking. >Fe and Mn are similar in diameter to Mg and are therefore also preferentially incorporated into calcite, with Fe/Ca ranging from ~3 to ~35 mmol/mol and Mn/Ca ratios up to ~80 mmol/mol (Fig. F1). The aragonite veins have lower Fe/Ca ratios (The carbonate veins have 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios ranging from ~0.70804 to 0.70872. The majority of the aragonite veins have Sr isotopic compositions between ~0.7087 and ~0.7086, whereas the calcite veins precipitated from fluids with 87 Sr/86 Sr ranging from ~0.7086 to ~0.7080. The strontium isotopic composition of the oceans ~15 m.y. Ago was ~0.70875 (Hodell et al., 1991), and it has increased progressively since then. All the carbonate veins precipitated from fluids with 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios lower than the seawater 87 Sr/86 Sr ratio has been since the eruption of the host basalt. The veins therefore all contain a discernible component of basalt derived Sr (87 Sr/86 Sr ~0.7027). The carbonate 13 C and 18 O compositions range from –3 to 4 VPDB (Vienna Peede belemnite) and 20 to 32 VSMOW (Vienna standard mean ocean water), respectively, within the range previously established for hydrothermally altered mid ocean ridge basalt–hosted calcite breccia cements and veins (Stakes and O’Neil, 1982).

I try to limit the amount of confusions in topic that we have covered before … Yesterday I have pointed the finger toward the cold pad batch dyeing process because this is the simplest model to use during our tough will (as truth seekers) of exact investigations in the laboratory for researching body transfer phenomena… For example : first of all we can try to do something of useful working with our feet on polyamidic soles or polyamide polyurethane covered soles … (But we are still free men and we are not working in a sort of laogai… So, we must try to do other works!). Louis, you wrote: >Part of the head can be seen on the imprint ?????? So, I turned a bit confused and I wrote “to chose” instead of “to choose” … Not, on that Mattress Imprint there is no head or “part of the head”. Instead there are the imprints of : – the shoulders – the beginning of a leg – an arm – an hand. The hand show a good resolution, the same for the buttocks, but there is not a similar resolution for the elbow or for the other bodily parts. So, if you claim the presence of the head, then you are in contadiction with the image that yourself showed us in your paper : “Can the Jospice Mattress Imprint be compared to the Image on the Shroud?” Another interesting question: I don’t know if you are right with your definition : polypropylene mattress because Dr. Fred Zugibe wrote something about a polyamidic material, covered with polyurethane … B.T.W. : Why you have not taken into account (in that your old paper) what wrote Dr. Fred Z ? It’s common opinion opinion that Shroud image is not truly similar to the Jospice Mattress Imprint. As you can read Dr. Zugibe (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/mattress.pdf) indicated interesting the features: >Fiber Composition = Nylon 6 (polyurethane coat) >Nature of Image = Bilirubin Pigments???? >The manufacturers indicated that the nylon was nylon 6 and that the outside coating was polyurethane. In any case: Polyamide is not polypropylene and polyurethane is not polypropylene. So, before to start with Metaphysical Travels on Jospice Imprint (in my opinion the Holy Shroud is another case, Jesus! Because, according to the doctrine of the Christian Faith, Jesus was/is God and man, then, “two species” are present in the nature of Jesus, the Son of God) we have to know what we have in front. Applied Materials Science can help us. Probably careful SPM controls can solve that enigma. If we are not able to solve this “little enigma”, then the door is open to the Parapsychology, Religion or unkown Physics … I am not an expert in the field of Parapsychological phenomena, I only want to see where is the chemical truth in this strange phenomenon and then I can only to start with a model. A model near the presumed pathway (possibly developed with maximum likelihood)… Where are the most acute analytical minds? For example, I have found an old (2005) “SNOM study”: Investigation of dyed human hair fibres using apertureless near field scanning optical microscopy F. Formanek, Y. De Wilde, G. S. Luengo & B. Querleux “Journal of Microscopy”, Vol. 224, Pt 2 November 2006, pp. 197–202 (Received 14 October 2005; accepted 24 May 2006) If using the SNOM you can see the hair (year = 2005), then you can also observe (in 2014 … …or when?) the polyamide fibers and thin layers of polyurethane… In conclusion: we can not put everything in a pot: Holy Shroud, the Holy Face of Manoppello, physical imprint of the poor died in Liverpool, Padre Pio Handkerchief, and so on… without studying fine details (in a careful manner!).

It is well known that the hardness of process water can cause different types of problems in textile processing. Water quality is the first thing for successful wet processing in textiles. I mentioned the issue of water hardness as emblematic reference. For example: if you work with hard water you do not get a good cold dyeing of polyamidic carpets. Have you tried to control what is the hardness of the water of Liverpool? Dyers needed clean, soft water… In fact there is soft (= S) water in Liverpool, that contributed to develop the textile industry. A constant supply of clean soft water was an absolute necessity for the dyer. Even the modern dyehouses are heavily dependent on the use of softened water… Also some chemicals like electrolytes and metal contamination of fiber by naturally or during production are responsible for hardness of bath water. That is why the total hardness of bath water should be maintained at a minimum level. In any case the addition of the tetrasodium salt of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) [… or other chelating products] permits to bypass some problem of water hardness (EDTA is a chelating agent and chelating agents are used to eliminate water hardness and heavy metals…).

It is significant that the masks preserved how a person really looked rather than how he wished to be seen. In that manner, “the brittle creaturality” of the human person, with all his flaws and imperfections, was preserved. … Link: http://www.classicist.org/programs/collections/historic plaster cast/catalogue/roman/030 010 003/ >Chicago – Some 2,000 years ago, elite Roman families stuffed their closets with wax masks made in the likeness of their male ancestors so that during funeral processions actors could fill in for the missing links of the genealogical line. >Scholars know about the strange practice from ancient sources, such as the Greek historian Polybius, though none of the masks themselves survive. >Recently, however, a team of researchers at Cornell University made life cast molds of their own faces to recreate these imagines maiorum, and they found that the wax masks were indeed uncannily lifelike.

The formation of capillary water bridges increases the shear modulus of the sand, which facilitates the sliding. Too much water, on the other hand, makes the capillary bridges coalesce, resulting in a decrease of the modulus; in this case, we observe that the friction coefficient increases again. Our results, therefore, show that the friction coefficient is directly related to the shear modulus; this has important repercussions for the transport of granular materials. In addition, the polydispersity of the sand is shown to also have a large effect on the friction coefficient.

Answer: >All of us have a number of naturally occurring radionuclides within our bodies. The major one that produces penetrating gamma radiation that can escape from the body is a radioactive isotope of potassium, called potassium 40. This radionuclide has been around since the birth of the earth and is present as a tiny fraction of all the potassium in nature. >Potassium 40 (40 K) is the primary source of radiation from the human body for two reasons. First, the 40 K concentration in the body is fairly high. Potassium is ingested in many foods that we eat and is a critically important element for proper functioning of the human body; it is present in pretty much all the tissues of the body. The amount of the radioactive isotope 40 K in a 70 kg person is about 5,000 Bq, which represents 5,000 atoms undergoing radioactive decay each second. >Second, 40 K emits gamma rays in a little over 10 percent of its decays and most of these gamma rays escape the body. A gamma ray is emitted in about one out of every 10 disintegrations of 40 K, implying that about 500 gamma rays are produced each second. These will be moving in all directions, some will be attenuated in the body, and the dose rate from these gamma rays outside of the individual’s body will represent a very small fraction of the normal background dose rate from all natural sources outside the body. >If a person is above average in weight, the dose rate outside of this person’s body will expectedly be higher than the dose outside the body of a lower weight individual. In both cases, however, the dose rate will be extremely small compared to the normal background dose rate. The heavier person will receive a greater internal dose because the decay of the 40 K produces other low penetrating radiation (beta radiation) that deposits its energy within the body. However, the dose to the heavier individual will not be significantly different from that to the lower weight individual because the energy deposited per unit body mass is the dose determining factor, and this will be about the same for both individuals. >There are many other radionuclides in the human body, but these either are present at lower levels than 40 K (for example, 238 U, 232 Th, and their decay products) or they do not emit gamma rays that can escape the body (for example, 14 C and 87 Rb). Radon (and its decay products) is not a significant source of radiation from humans because it is present at very low levels in the body. >There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. … Link: http://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/faqradbods.html — — — So, our body (with the normal levels of radiation) can not produce an Image like that of the Shroud Then … Do you think at “enhanced radioactive emissions” as “possible solution” of the problem?

Formaldehyde from Combustion. The combustion of wood is a natural source of formaldehyde. Hedberg et al. Have studied birch combustion and report formaldehyde emission rates of 180−710 mg/kg wood. (Reference: Hedberg E.; Kristensson A.; Ohlsson M.; Johansson C.; Johansson P. Å.; Swietlicki E.; Vesely V.; Wideqvist U.; Westerholm R. Atmos. Environ. 2002, 36, 4823) So, the formation of formaldehyde from combustion processes is well known. The emission rate is often presented in the unit μg g−1 (mass emitted per mass of material burnt). Lee and Wang measured formaldehyde concentrations up to 300 μg m−3 in a 18.26 m3 test chamber when burning incense sticks. The emission rate was 300−1700 μg per g stick. See also wood combustion and cigarette smoking … Baek and Jenkins measured an average formaldehyde concentration of 234 μg m−3 when six cigarettes were smoked in a 30 m3 chamber under almost static conditions. A study by Baker with 13 experimental cigarettes (saccharides added) gave emission rates between 30 μg g−1 and 57 μg per cigarette smoked. In the study by Singer et al., distinctly higher formaldehyde emission rates of 950−1310 μg per cigarette smoked were measured. Maroni et al. Report 70−100 μg formaldehyde in the undiluted mainstream smoke of nonfilter cigarettes and 0.2 mg per cigarette in sidestream smoke. According to Baker et al., formaldehyde is mainly generated from the pyrolysis of saccharides used as tobacco ingredients.

In an experimental study using radiolabeled glucose and sucrose added to research cigarettes, up to 0.06% of the label was found in acetaldehyde (Gager et al., 1971b), which at a sugar application level of 5% (40 mg per cigarette) would translate to an ingredient related contribution to the overall acetaldehyde yield of approximately 5%, assuming an average overall yield of acetaldehyde of approximately 500 μg per cigarette. Taken together, sugars used as ingredients do not produce greater yields of acetaldehyde in mainstream smoke than are produced from tobacco itself… … Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3296517/ — — — Trying to read something about air sampling in occupational environments I have found an article: “Chemosorption sampling and analysis of formaldehyde in air.
