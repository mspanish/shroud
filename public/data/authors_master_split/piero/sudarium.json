[{"id":"comment-190820","author":"piero","post":"Biometric systems for human recognition are very interesting… obviously you must extract facial features from the Sudarium of Oviedo (and, if I am right, this is not too easy to do…). — — — In any case “Facial feature extraction” consists in localizing the most characteristic face components (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.) within images that depict human faces. I believe that we can try to measure : Distance between the eyes Width of the nose Distance between nose and mouth Height and Width of forehead and total face and then we can apply the comparison When we have to do with religious art representations (in comparison with the TS and Sudarium of Oviedo) we can use PCA (= Principal Component Analysis). The same can be performed on numismatic field (see also: prof. Giulio Fanti and his “numismatic dating”). As I wrote in the past, in the book (2014) by Giulio Fanti the Byzantine coins of Justinian II of 692 695 were reevaluated to better understand the influence of the Shroud image. Prof. Eng. G. Fanti in his own book used nose/eyes ratio… … and then Barrie Schwortz rejected “Freeman’s claims” and indicated the numismatic proof about the early coins (= byzantine coins, IMO). And, if I’m not mistaken, you have never considered this simple fact. — — Perhaps you can improve the discussion reading the paper: “Facial Feature Extraction and Principal Component Analysis for Face Detection in Color Images” Link: http://doras.dcu.ie/285/1/lncs 3212.pdf Abstract. >A hybrid technique based on facial feature extraction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA = PCA is a useful statistical technique. See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal component analysis ) is presented for frontal face detection in color images. Facial features such as eyes and mouth are automatically detected based on properties of the associated image regions, which are extracted by RSST color segmentation. While mouth feature points are identified using the redness property of regions, a simple search strategy relative to the position of the mouth is carried out to identify eye feature points from a set of regions. Priority is given to regions which signal high intensity variance, thereby allowing the most probable eye regions to be selected. On detecting a mouth and two eyes, a face verification step based on Eigenface theory is applied to a normalized search space in the image relative to the distance between the eye feature points. It’s useful the use of a facial feature extraction step prior to performing PCA analysis… — — — I have found another paper: “An application of caricature: How to improve the recognition of facial composites” Charlie Frowda, Vicki Bruceb, David Rossc, Alex Mc Intyrec & Peter J. B. Hancockc at pages 954 984 of “Visual Cognition”, Volume 15, Issue 8, 2007 Link: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13506280601058951 Abstract >Facial caricatures exaggerate the distinctive features of a face and may elevate the recognition of a familiar face. We investigate whether the recognition of facial composites, or pictures of criminal faces, could be similarly enhanced. In this study, participants first estimated the degree of caricature necessary to make composites most identifiable. Contrary to expectation, an anticaricature was found to be best, presumably as this tended to reduce the appearance of errors. In support of this explanation, more positive caricature estimates were assigned to morphed composites: representations that tend to contain less overall error. In addition, anticaricaturing reduced identification for morphed composites but enhanced identification for individual composites. Although such improvements were too small to be of value to law enforcement, a sizeable naming benefit was observed when presenting a range of caricature states, which appeared to capitalize on individual differences in the internal representation of familiar faces. — — — Here a question: Is the caricature a key to understand the strange Manoppello’s Veil? — — — Here (obviously) I have kept aside the controversial issue of the two ancient Roman coins (… that with the Sudarium of Oviedo have nothing to do !!!)..","date":"2015-02-12","mins":"8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"},{"id":"comment-215368","author":"piero","post":"In principle I am opposed to dating with the C14 because this is a destructive method.
