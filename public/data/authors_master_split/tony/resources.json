[{"id":"comment-9501","author":"tony","post":"Modern day Christianity loathing Academia is almost unanimous in saying that Jesus did in fact exist. The much trumpeted gnostic gospels are also quietly acknowledged by the vast majority of scholars to have been written AFTER the New Testament narratives. Secular pagan sources such as Pliny, Seutonius, Tacitus, Josephus, etc all acknowledge that the man existed. These sources were written within living memory of Jesus’ death. Josephus, for example, was born in 37 AD, and died in 100. Tacitus was born in 56 AD, and died in 117. Different people from different backgrounds (supporters, neutral, enemies), ALL acknowledged that he existed, and was considered to be the messiah (christus). Pliny even writes that his followers would sing a hymn to him on a given day, “as to a god”. Sounds an awful lot like Sunday church to me. What is supposed to have happened on Sunday, again? Even the Jews who rejected Jesus, and who had the most to gain by denying his existence and miracles, referred to him as a “magician” who was executed for enticing the people to blasphemy. Christianity can take many ugly forms. That, combined with the pain of this world, can produce some very rabid atheists. Nevertheless, if Academia (which hates Christianity almost as a matter of official policy) cannot bring itself to deny the existence of the Nazarene, then this new generation of the Jesus didn’t exist crowd is doomed to be shouting into the wind, just like all the others before it. BTW. There is only ONE passage in Josephus that appears to have been tampered with. Most scholars agree that when Josephus writes “he was the Christ” it is apocryphal. Elsewhere, he writes “he was CALLED the Christ”. Arabic translations of the passage in question, however, state “he was CALLED the Christ”, which would be consistent with Joesphus’ other descriptions. It was tampered with, yes, but it seems to have been the removal of just one or two words..","date":"2012-03-21","mins":"7:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/21/bart-ehrmans-new-book-did-jesus-exist/","cat":"books","title":"Bart Ehrman’s new book: ‘Did Jesus Exist?"}]
