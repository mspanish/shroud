Sure, one can never say “irrefutably” that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, but the scientific evidence, when coupled with the historical evidence of the Edessa Cloth, permit a very warranted conclusion that the Shroud is very likely what many believe it to be. It may not be a 100% “irrefutable” position, but didn’t everyone say that the now debunked C14 tests provided “irrefutable” evidence that it was a fake? A strange double standard is at work here. One piece of now invalid scientific evidence “proved” it was a fake, and now all the other evidence, no matter how incredible, must be framed as inconclusive simply because it isn’t “irrefutable” in absolute terms..","date":"2012-02-28","mins":"4:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/28/paper-chase-to-know-a-veil-by-philip-ball/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase: To know a veil by Philip Ball"},{"id":"comment-8837","author":"tony","post":"So the photo neg quality is just some irrelevant fluke, is it?

It is hard to think that I was alone. Of course we now know why the tests were invalid, but I don’t think it is fair to criticize Colin for coming to more or less the same conclusion, but from a skeptic’s point of view. That being said, I think the honest skeptic will admit that his or her belief that the shroud is fake is at odds with what is known about the cloth. “Someday science will show how it is a fake” seems the most honorable position for the doubters. Perhaps people like Colin resist this stance because it is uncomfortably too close to admitting it is likely genuine. But why waste time with dialogue? Eventually the “discussion” degenerates to the point where the one who is defending the indefensible pretends that by not changing his/her mind, he actually has a point. Would anyone seriously argue with someone who insists on a 6 day creation? This is an extreme example, but still valid. Whatever it is that causes the person to adopt a ridiculous stance, it certainly isn’t the evidence. Arguing about it does no good. There is something else at work here. Let Colin believe whatever he wishes, I say. I seriously doubt that the message of this “silent witness” is that those who reject it go to hell. We’re told that only those who reject the Spirit of God are damned. Though Jesus is the voice and presence of this eternal reality in history, he no doubt knew that people could be honestly mistaken about him as a historical figure (to say nothing about those born before his historical manifestation). If the Shroud of Turin is a splinter in Colin’s subconscious, depriving him of peace of mind vis a vis his worldview, it is ultimately HIS problem. In my opinion, you’re wasting calories arguing with the guy. Best of luck, Colin, but you’ve got your head DEEP in the sand, pal..","date":"2012-03-05","mins":"11:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-8991","author":"tony","post":"There are certain truths which are almost cold and hard, like 2 and 2 make 4. No one really cares about these truths on a personal level. But what if there were certain truths which pertained to relationships? Certainly “I love you” is a truth, however fleeting, which sometimes exists among people. This is a truth between two living beings, not something cold and impersonal like 2 and 2 make 4. The Judeo Christian religion is the story of a revelation about the relationship between almighty God and humanity (for those of us who believe it). Indeed, it is the story of God’s relationship to his entire creation (with mankind as the conscious element of it). God’s manifestation was born in a manger….but as a man. And not any man, either. He was born as a Jew: the people who, however imperfectly, stumbled upon the dichotomy between good and evil, and grounded it in a story of God, and rebellion against him (ie, they had Genesis as their foundational text). In paganism, even the worst of gods was prayed to. But for the Jews, the devil would always be the devil, and God would always be God. For them, evil will always be evil, and God will always be God. That’s not something you can say about paganism, can you? Again, in paganism, even the most vile of gods was to be prayed to. Dismiss Genesis as Bronze Age superstition all you want, but these Bronze Age people were the ONLY ones to stumble upon the dichotomy of Good and Evil (grounding it in beings known as God, and the devil). Even the Greeks couldn’t grasp the nature of evil. They posited ethics, NOT morality. For them, the law was written in the mind, not the heart. Transgressions against the law of the cosmos could be due to weakness, ignorance, or stupidity….but never immorality. Ultimately, immorality was a reality which they knew existed, but which they could never fully explain. It was the Jews who knew the law existed in the heart. Who CARES if Peter and Paul believed in a literal Genesis. Do you really think God would expect them to tell the heathens of the spiritual foundation of the world, AND tell them that the universe was 13 or so billion years old TOO? As far as I’m concerned, God manifested himself to humanity in Jesus of Nazareth. It was he who purified and distilled the striking dichotomy found only in the Jewish myths. Yalweh may have supposedly approved of the bloody conquest of Palestine (while still viewing the Caananites as his children), but it was Jesus who in essence said that violence was never sacred. The Jews may have been entitled to fight for their lives, but it was for them, not God. Render unto Caesar… That Jesus of Nazareth quite possibly used the Jewish tradition as a light for mankind, telling us that ALL decent people (those who knowingly or unknowingly listen to the voice of God), will be saved and taken to the TRUE promised land, the kingdom of God (not blood soaked palestine), –that the carpenter from Nazareth ultimately told humanity this message and paid for it with is life, I can’t help but feel is a divine message, applicable to all people at all times. And no truth can be destroyed, can it?. It just IS. Like the Jewish God, ay? What was it that God told Moses? “I am who IS”. Likewise, Jesus IS, hence his (alleged) victory over death. That Moses was a man of his time, and his “reality” was expressed however imperfectly…..well, what would you expect? God has a relationship to PEOPLE, not computers. And if some people lived in the Bronze Age…..well, do you really expect them to express themselves as YOUR contemporary? Anyway, Colin. If you think that belief in Jesus of Nazareth is exemplified in the most provincial and idiotic of beliefs, you really need to get out more. However clumsily I have tried to clue you in to the fact that “Chrisitianity” goes far deeper than most of its detractors care to admit. And if you call yourself a thinking person, be honest and address THOUGHTFUL versions of Christianity, not just straw men easily demolished. You’re an academic aren’t you? Do your HOMEWORK Colin. Perhaps this inexplicable “Image of a serene, bearded man” is a subtle message to you that maybe, juuust maybe, there is something to the ancient yet eternal message from the carpenter from Nazareth. All the best.
