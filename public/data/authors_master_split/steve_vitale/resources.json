[{"id":"comment-192290","author":"steve_vitale","post":"What I said in my post is from the 2 shows I mentioned, not my assumptions. As I stated, one of the original scientists from Arizona was interviewed. He told the story that I summarized: that after they reviewed the “error paper” I mentioned above, their lab found the repair fabrics weaved into the last sample they had. When they separated the fabrics, the older swatch tested to the 1st century (and I think he also indicated the newer fabric was from the 16th century, but I can’t remember for sure). That same scientist indicated the original results were “averaged” and commented that individually the differences were beyond acceptable tolerances. He went on to say that should have alerted them to a problem, but they ignored it. This might help, a report of the carbon dating results. Http://www.shroud.com/nature.htm If you look toward the bottom, Table 3, the date ranges are all over the map. Also, note the 2 other contributors, including the British Museum’s Research Laboratory. And of the testing labs, the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and History of Art, University of Oxford. Given what was at stake, it seems highly unlikely the Vatican would have given samples of a priceless relic to anything but reputable laboratories, so your comment about peer review, questioning the lab results, is not really valid. As you can see, what you believed to be assumptions, were not assumptions on my part, they were reported by one of the original testing scientists from the Arizona lab..","date":"2015-03-03","mins":"11:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/13/two-more-articles-about-upcoming-cnn-series-on-finding-jesus/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Two More Articles About Upcoming CNN Series on Finding Jesus"},{"id":"comment-192400","author":"steve_vitale","post":"Well this has certainly been ridiculously more frustrating than I had bargained for. I applied the date filter in You Tube to a Shroud of Turin search and there’s nothing older than 5 years. The second time I saw the Part 2 show I mentioned was probably early 2000’s. The carbon dating was done in 1988, so the two shows were probably produced in the 90’s. Also, I said the show MAYBE PBS. I searched on the PBS, Discovery, History Channel, KCET, websites and there’s nothing related to the shroud. It’s not surprising they don’t have programing archives going back over 10 years. So I guess I’m SOL. I saw the show twice and I know what I heard. Believe want you want. The only other interesting tidbit I remember (but not really relevant to the results) is, the Arizona lab scientist interviewed on the show included a side story of a colleague (and shroud tester) who was adamant about the shroud being a fraud. He’s the guy I mentioned that said they had scanned the shroud and didn’t see repair fabric, so he questioned that theory. While they were studying their last testable shroud swatch and eventually testing it, the colleague contracted cancer. He died after the testing was completed, but before he did, he made a plea to the interviewed scientist to make sure the new test results were made public and the truth be known (which admitted they had made errors in the original tests). A bit of drama, I know, but an interesting side note..","date":"2015-03-04","mins":"12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/13/two-more-articles-about-upcoming-cnn-series-on-finding-jesus/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Two More Articles About Upcoming CNN Series on Finding Jesus"},{"id":"comment-192198","author":"steve_vitale","post":"The Shroud of Turin show on CNN is irresponsible journalism and bad science. Where have you people been? This issue was resolved a long time ago, shortly AFTER the first carbon dating tests. There was a 2 part series (on PBS maybe? I’ve seen it twice) that first reported, like you just did, a 14th century dating. The part 2 show (perhaps a year or so later), resolved the issue for good. Most of the interviews were with one of the scientists who conducted the original carbon dating at the Arizona lab. He admitted that the original results ignored basic science logic and protocols (probably because they were scientists and WANTED the shroud to be a forgery). He indicated the 3 labs that ran the tests had returned dramatically different results, which should have been a BIG red flag. Carbon dating cannot be that inaccurate, but they ignored it and took an AVERAGE (how stupid and unscientific) of the results to come up with the 14th century date. Then two university professors (Midwest husband and wife I think) suspected an error and submitted a paper on it. The wife was an expert in medieval fabrics. Her conclusions turned out to be correct. It was a common medieval practice to repair fabrics by weaving in new fabric. Carbon dating COUNTS carbon atoms. Since we scientifically know at what rate carbon atoms decay, we can mathematically figure out a material’s age. So each lab’s dramatically different results simply meant the swatch each one tested had varying amounts of original fabric versus repair fabric. The Arizona lab first said they had scanned the shroud and didn’t see different fabrics, but oops, bad science again. The scientist interviewed on the show realized they had only scanned the IMAGE, not the borders of the shroud where the swatches were cut from (Duh!). They luckily had enough material to test again and showed a microscopic shot of the two fabric materials weaved together. When the older fabric was separated it was dated at the time of Jesus. The show also reported a previous challenge for anyone to recreate the shroud. Artists, scientists, and doctors tried. The only one who came remotely close was an artist. We saw footage of how it looked similar to the naked eye, but under an electron microscope it was flat, while the real shroud clearly showed dimensional contours of the body.
