Here is a Rubens’ ‘deposition’: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Deposition (Rubens) In Dutch: ‘Kruisafneming’ vs. ‘Graflegging’; in German: ‘Kreuzabnahme’ vs. ‘Grablegung’. In English, the distinction is perhaps somewhat less clear, I don’t know. And of course, there are also paintings representing intermediate scenes, such as the transport from the Cross towards the tomb. The Antwerp painting is most often referred to (in English’) as ‘The Descent from the Cross’. The main point is, that the ‘descent from the cross’ is not described in the gospels. A fortiori, no ‘linen’ of ‘shroud’ is mentioned in connection with the descent from the cross. Rubens recycled iconographic elements that were in common use, including some kind of shroud or linen being depicted in connection with the ‘descent from the Cross’. However, this shroud or linen is unusually prominent on the Antwerp painting. Compare for instance with this painting (da Volterra) that had directly inspired Rubens:.","date":"2014-12-02","mins":"8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/02/paper-chase-new-paper-by-jos-verhulst-on-rubens-descent-from-the-cross/","cat":"art","title":"Paper Chase:  New paper by Jos Verhulst on Rubens’ Descent from the Cross"},{"id":"comment-40968","author":"jos_verhulst","post":"See “Some remarks on the relationship between the Shroud of Turin and Michelangelo’s Last Judgement (Sistine Chapel)” on http://www.rubensdepot.webs.com/ especially fig.4 6.","date":"2013-08-11","mins":"10:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/why-dont-i-see-the-swollen-nose-in-any-of-the-art/","cat":"art","title":"Why don’t I see the swollen nose in any of the art?"}]
