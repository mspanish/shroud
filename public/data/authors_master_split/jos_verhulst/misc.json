Of course you don’t see that face at a glance. If the hypothesis is true, the image is encoded. It’s secret, meaning that it will be difficult to see it. In order to check the hypothesis, a good start would be to measure the proportions of the supposed eyes, nose, and mouth, and compare the results to the same measurements made on the shroud image. A second check could be to control for pecularities on the shroud image: are these reflected in this painting? For instance: the nose of the shroud image is concave towards the left. Is this concavity also suggested by the position of Christ, who is supposed to be on the dorsum of the nose of the hypothetical ‘Sixtine face’?

Basically, Christ and his followers (and also groups such as the Samaritans and some Essenes) used the original Mosaic pre exile Jewish calendar and held their passover meal according to that calendar. At the temple, the modified post exile and ‘official’ calendar was used. The synoptic gospels refer to the non offical calendar, as is stated implicitely in Marc 14:12 (see Humphreys p.152 ff). The fact that John refers (11:55), not simply to ‘the Passover’, but to the ‘Jewish Passover’, indicates, according to Humphreys (p.162 ff), that he refers to the ‘official’ calendar. The ‘last supper’ was on Wednesday April 1st, 33, that was Passover day according to the pre exile calendar. I highly recommend the book by Humphreys; the whole argument is impossible to summarize here. As to the birthday of Jezus, it should be noted that the gospels seem to relate two different births. For instance, the genealogies in Matt.1 and Luke 3 are different, and the stories in both these gospels have but very few common elements. The possibility should be considered, that there where indeed two births. According to the esoteric christian tradition represented f.i. By the flemish painter P.P.Rubens, there are even three time points that should be taken into account: Tuesday 15 september 7 BC, 18:10; Friday 14 january 1 AD, 21u05; and Sunday 25 december 1 AD, especially 23u50 (local time, Jerusalem & surroundings, julian calendar)..","date":"2012-05-26","mins":"10:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"id":"comment-29757","author":"jos_verhulst","post":"For a good illustration of the problems, have a look at this: The problem is not so much with the ‘review’ part, but mainly with the ‘peer’ part.
