In these hymnes, the image is characterized as having been imprinted (on a piece of textile) ‘without colour’ (achromastikon tuposas seautov) or with ‘strange colours’ (‘ksenois chromasin’). Arguably, the unknown authors of these hymnes tried to describe the unusual chromatic properties of the image on the mandylion. This suggests that the image was not perceived as being ‘painted’; paintwork implies the presence of ‘colour’ in the usual sense of that word. Incidentally, there are also numerous passages indicating that the image on the mandylion was not a face only, but a complete ‘gestalt’ (‘morphei’). That such was the case, was (on other grounds) also argued by prof.Karlheinz Dietz (‘Das Abgardbild als Ganzkörperbild’).","date":"2014-10-19","mins":"1:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"}]
