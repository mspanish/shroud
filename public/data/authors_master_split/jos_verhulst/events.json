[{"id":"comment-34412","author":"jos_verhulst","post":"This ‘witness principle’ is very important indeed. Look it up in John: two witnesses are required (Joh.8:16 18). In Joh.19:38 42 there are two men that put Jesus in the grave. In John 20:1 11, there are again two men verifying that the grave was empty. Thereafter, in John 20:11 20, things take a more spiritual turn. There are now two angels in the grave. These angels are a spiritual reflection, of the double image on the Shroud. Have a look at the text. These angels were white, as the Shroud was. They were where the body of Christ was, each at one end of that place. And what they speak out is the logical conclusion, that must have been formed ,bit by bit and very gradually, in the head of Maria M., when she saw the image on the Shroud. These two angels are at the same time a representation of the Shroud, and those who speak out what the Shroud means as a witness. Tom Tracy is right. Note that this ‘two witnesses’ principle continues, in a very surprising way, in John 20:19 29, where Thomas the Twin speaks out..","date":"2013-05-23","mins":"5:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/23/a-kind-of-witness/","cat":"event","title":"A kind of witness?"}]
