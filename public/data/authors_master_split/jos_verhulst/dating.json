The simple fact is that such a trend, whether smooth or chaotic, should not exist. It was also not observed in the control samples. The presence of the trend proves that the experimentators were not measuring age, but something else, most probably age combined with some unknown factor x. As long as this unknown thing that was measured is not identified, no conclusion can be drawn. Stating that the age determination remains valid, implies that you already know something about the nature of the factor x that causes the trend. But the nature of that factor is completely unknown; there are only wild & uneducated guesses, and it is impossible to rationally predict the impact of factor x on an hypothetical measurement done on some other part of the Shroud. The only rational conclusion is, that a new 14 C experiment should be done, with a different protocol, involving sample taking at different parts of the Shroud, and documenting the geometry of the subsamples. Too bad that the laboratories did not document this geometry, thereby involuntary destroying evidence that they had in their hands..","date":"2012-04-29","mins":"2:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/28/new-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Peer Reviewed Paper on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin."},{"id":"comment-10945","author":"jos_verhulst","post":"@Gabriel “I would like to stress the idea that another implication of the presence of a trend obtained from a combination of results independently obtained at different laboratories is that these labs did a good job”. There are two possible interpretations. On the one hand, there is the ‘conspiracy interpretation’, based on the fact that factor x correlates not only with a spatial gradient, but also with a temporal gradient: the measurements that were made later, also produced an older age for the Shroud. If factor x has spatial and not temporal/sequential significance, which seems by far the more probable interpretation, your conclusion is certainly valid. However, the labs did a good job only with respect to the measurements proper. They did an extremely lousy job as far as the documenting of the spatial distribution of the samples & subsamples is concerned.

It has been stated that there is a problem with the shroud sample used for the dating of the Shroud, because the results of measurements done at the three labs suggest linear variation of the age measured as a function of the place where the measurement is done. The Arizona piece offers a possibility to check this statement. Supposing that the variation of the measured age with spatial distance is real, a prediction could be made concerning the C14 age of this piece, because its spatial position on the Shroud is known. Measurement could then validate or invalidate that prediction. Of course, it should first be checked whether the ‘mysterious Arizona piece’ really is what it is claimed to be..","date":"2013-11-10","mins":"5:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/10/the-mysterious-arizona-piece/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Mysterious Arizona Piece"},{"id":"comment-24800","author":"jos_verhulst","post":"The basic problem with this paper can be illustrated starting from the sentence preceeding the conclusion: “If contamination caused a discrepancy of 15,000 years in the dating of fossil bones, the contamination identified by this paper could have caused a discrepancy of 1300 years in the Shroud of Turin”. This comparison between a shift from 35,000 years to 50,000 years on the one hand, and a shift from 700 years to 2000 years on the other hand, is simply inadequate. In a sample of age 700, about 88% of the 14 C atoms still survive; in a sample of age 2,000, about 70% of the original 14 C atoms did not decay. Ir order to push up the percentage from 70% to 88%, and using a recent biocarbon source with 100% of the 14 C still present, about 60% of the original carbon in the sample has to be replaced by contamination mechanisms of all sorts. Of course, this replacement percentage of 60% becomes larger still when the contamination is produced by older carbon, dating from the 16th century, for example. But in a sample of age 50,000 y, only 0,00155% of the 14 C atoms survive (taking the half life = 5,700 y). In a sample of 35,000 y, 0,215% of the 14 C survives. Suppose that we use contamination material of age 5,700 y (36% of the 14 C still present). Then we need to replace only 0,55% of the carbon in the sample to produce a ‘rejuvenation’ from 50,000y=>35,000y. Of course, these are only some back of the envelope calculations but they illustrate the main problem: in very old samples, contamination can easily have a huge impact on the age measurement, because there is only very few 14 C left. But in ‘young’ samples (‘young’ a compared to the half life of 14 C) it is much more difficult to significantly alter the measured age by contamination..","date":"2013-02-19","mins":"5:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/13/special-paper-chase-new-possibilities-why-the-c14-dating-of-the-shroud-may-be-wrong/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"SPECIAL PAPER CHASE: New Possibilities Why the C14 Dating of the Shroud May Be Wrong"},{"id":"comment-50632","author":"jos_verhulst","post":"First of all the piece discussed in Freer Waters & Jull, Radiocarbon 52, p.1521 1527.
