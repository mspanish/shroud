It is, in its way, as circumstantial as much of the evidence supporting the authenticity of the Shroud. Any individual’s view of the Shroud – even those for whom none of the contrary evidence holds any water at all – is ultimately based on a balance of evidence, not on anything conclusive.

It is probably unwise to comment in detail when all we have here is a very basic taster, but when did that ever stop me? Some observations, then. 1) Eleven genera of plants identified are listed in the paper. Is it curious that only two of these (Prunus and Carpinus) also appear on Max Frei’s pollen identifications? 2) According to various sources, the shroud was liberally scattered with Gundelia, Matricaria, Anthemis, Helichrysum and/or Carduus. None of these names appears in the report above. 3) Presumably the largest component of the vacuumings from the Shroud, by quite a long way, is Linum usitatissimum. Does the manufacture of linen destroy its DNA, or couldn’t that be used to locate the source of the material rather more precisely than the various adventitious plants whose appearance is only in minute traces?.","date":"2014-09-20","mins":"6:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/20/paper-chase-uncovering-the-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  Uncovering the Sources of DNA on the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-215938","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, I’ll bet a pound to a penny that if the DNA of Jesus is ever accurately determined, it will be that of a normal XY male with minimal chromosomal abnormality.
