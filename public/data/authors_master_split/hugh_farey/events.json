To take a couple: 1) (from daveb above) “Effect of 1532 fire on paint products: Hematite expected, heating tests had shown that hematite was reduced to magnetite, no such effect observed on Shroud.” Rogers’s experiments, and the accompanying photos, show a piece of linen sandwiched between two steel plates and heated at the centre. I would like to know whereabouts, on the cloth, the hematite was reduced to magnetite, and whether there were concomittant effects on the cloth at the same point. Presumably there was some gradient. Rogers says that, “all paints were changed by heat and/or the chemically reducing and reactive pyrolysis products (formaldehyde, furfural, organic acids, CO, etc.). Some Medieval painting materials become water soluble and they would have moved with the water that diffused through parts of the cloth at the time of the AD 1532 fire. Observations of the Shroud in 1978 showed that nothing in the image moved with the water.” But he does not say what temperatures are needed to achieve these effects, and whether those temperatures also cause any discolouration of linen fibres. The temperature gradient is very important. Either there was one, in which case we would expect different effects on different parts of he Shroud, or there wasn’t, in which case we would observe uniform effects. 2) (from Rogers’ paper) Compare Figures 3 and 18. They are both claimed to be UV images but are completely different. Figure 18 shows that the Holland cloth fluoresces (if it is fluorescence) intensely at the place from which the Raes sample was taken, but not elsewhere, but Rogers does not account for this. Being covered with the Shroud would have had minimal effect on the oxygenation or temperature of that area compared to the rest. 3) (from Rogers’ paper) “Diane Soran (deceased) of Los Alamos, tested hemolysis on Saponaria washed cloth before we went to Turin. The blood is still red on those 25 year old samples. Controls are black.” I have grown Saponaria, produced soap from it and soaked cloths in it. It has had no effect on the preservation of blood colour. It is a pity that in a heavily illustrated paper Diane Soran’s experiments could not be shown. I mention these not to prove that Rogers was a poor scientist, agenda driven (neither of which I believe) or even wrong, but merely to show that even the most careful of papers can have inconsistencies and anomalies which it is not rude or arrogant to want cleared up before being accepted as gospel..","date":"2015-03-17","mins":"3:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"id":"comment-193643","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think that’s fair enough. “I know nothing about science, so I’m prepared to accept the authority of someone who does,” is a reasonable attitude. I, on the other other hand, understand enough of Rogers’s paper to find it scattered with inconsistencies of sufficient weight to cast doubt on many of his conclusions. I think that’s fair enough too. What is not fair, if I may cavill for a moment, is bickering like this: “Nevertheless despite demonstrating this fact, Hugh Farey credulously maintains without good reason that the dating should stand.” You may not agree with my demonstrations, but to deny that I have argued them, consistently, with evidence, more or since since my first posting on this site, is simply petty. So is this, if I may say so: “But the Catholic science teacher, editor of the BSTS newsletter, cannot believe that his Lord and Master has left him the tangible material means by which he may advocate the reality and truth of His death and resurrection.” But never mind. I agree with this: “It certainly seems curious that if the Shroud is a sample of the Quem Quaeritis cloths, that it should be the only one to survive.” I believe this to be a major objection to the Quem Quaeritis hypothesis, and there are several others, many of which I have clearly set out on this site. There are objections to the stability of the C14 dating, and there is some evidence in favour of both a 1st century date and a Middle Eastern provenance, which I have also acknowledged in detail. On balance, as I have said and explained why, before, I believe that the Shroud is medieval, and for this conclusion I have been personally abused by most of the authenticists who comment on this site. I, on the other hand, quite understand why they have come to a contrary opinion, and sincerely wish them well in their efforts to substantiate their view. I believe that this attitude makes me a particularly good choice as editor of a Shroud newsletter, and hope that I may maintain the BSTS’s editorial impartiality for as long as required.

As such, it does not demonstrate where Mc Crone went wrong, which would have been helpful, and demonstrates an unscientific partiality. For instance, Mc Crone examined 10 more slides than Heller and Adler, and found red ochre adhering to fibres on 18 of them, all those which corresponded to image or blood areas, and none on non image areas. He illustrates his findings on page 105 of ‘Judgment Day for the Turin Shroud.’ This was the foundation of his ‘painting’ hypothesis. Well, did he or didn’t he? Are the photos falsified fabrications? Are all those red particles not iron oxide at all? If they are related to the retting procedure, they would be found on non image as well as image fibres, and if they are related to the blood, they would be found on blood areas but not image areas.

Di Lazzaro says that the conclusion denies the possibility of a scorch, when in fact it does exactly the opposite, if, as Colin suggests we interpret “something which resulted in oxidation, dehydration and conjugation of the polysaccharide structure of the microfibrils of the linen” and “a similar type of change in linen can be obtained by sulfuric acid or heat” as, indeed, forms of scorch. Similarly, the S Tu RP conclusion’s reference to the 3 D quality of the image very carefully omits any mention of any form of transfer of information across a “cloth body distance” although it comes down quite firmly in favour of a contact transfer. It is a subtle point, but the fact that the image seems to relate to a possible cloth body distance does not mean that some kind of transfer of information across that distance actually caused it. A charcoal copy of the shroud would also imply some form cloth body distance/intensity relationship, but would obviously not be made by it. Finally Nabber finds a quotation which almost exactly parallels Colin’s statement about UV above, but seems to think it means the opposite. Bern Kohler’s mention of ‘photochemical havoc’ refers specifically to the damage caused by UV radiation to human cells; as Colin says “one is right to flag up the dangers of excessive uv exposure where humans and their crops are concerned.” Kohler, like Colin, is well aware that most materials are unaffected by UV radiation. Colin’s criticism of these specific points in di Lazzaro’s interpretation of the S Tu RP conclusion is entirely justified.

I believe, for example, that there is a consensus among climate scientists that global CO2 levels are increasing. There are many scientists who disagree, but the consensus is… etc. Etc. It is in this context that I believe that, if there is any consensus at all, the consensus among those interested in the shroud is that it is not the burial cloth of Jesus. That doesn’t mean it’s true, it’s just what most of them believe, I think. As to people who claimed to be king of the Jews, the ever useful Wikipedia lists eight others from around the time of Jesus, from Simon of Perea (c. 4 BC) to Lukuas (115 AD), and they were just the leaders of the main revolts against the Romans. Any of them, or any of their officers might have merited some form of mock helmet. The identification of the injuries made by a cap of spikes with a royal crown is very much a post hoc propter hoc argument. As far as Ron has read, he says, crucifixions did not normally include a severe flogging beforehand. I would be interested to know of any first or second century sources for that statement, and whether they applied across the Roman empire, or locally to the area from which they come. My own reading suggests that we simply do not know. Similarly, I do not believe there is any evidence that Jewish crucifixion victims were ‘normally’ thrown into common graves, and even if they were, I do not believe the graves were then likely to have been excavated by wild animals. As I have mentioned, the only crucifixion victim whose remains have been identified as such was in a family ossuary. Daveb suggests, sensibly, that there may be no way of identifying crucifixion victims from their bones anyway, except in the case of the poor chap whose execution was bungled. Ron concludes his latest comment by saying that there is no doubt that the shroud is Jesus – “or a depiction of him.” While I agree that if the image is a depiction, it is most likely that it is a depiction of Jesus (not a certainly, as there are a few other candidates, but a strong probability), I think that if it is not a “depiction,” then the probability that it comes from the body of Jesus is considerably less. As to the consensus being “ridiculous” then for all I know Ron might be right; lots of consensuses are. That doesn’t stop them from being consensuses, however. Finally, although I have said that I think estimates of probability are naive, I think that of behalf of the ridiculous consensusees, I’ll try to make one. I’m going to claim (and I challenge anyone to produce archaeological or historical evidence against these), that 25% of all crucifixion victims did not have their legs broken but were stabbed as a confirmation of death, that 5% were mercilessly flogged before being crucified, and that 1% were treated to a spiked helmet or crown. Assuming these three treatments were independent, then 1 in every 8000 crucifixions had injuries similar to those on the shroud. Let us suppose that the Romans crucified Jews for about 400 years, at a rate of 1 a day except during rebellions when the number rose to 500 a day according to Josephus. Let’s go for a total of 160 000. That means that 20 were crucified in the same way as Jesus. Of those, one left a shroud that remains to this day. I wonder which one… (daveb, I’m sure, will counter this argument very reasonably, but I make it just to show that wild claims of billions to one owe more to hopeful faith than to statistics).","date":"2013-01-27","mins":"7:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/25/eric-j-jumper-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Eric J.

I think we looked at this some months ago, in connection with the coins of Justinian II of Byzantium. Suffice it to say that until the statue of Zeus from Olympia was removed to Byzantium in about 420 AD, most (all?) pictures of Christ had short frizzy hair and a stubbly beard. When pictures of Christ with long beard and hair appeared, some people deplored the fact that he resembled the statue of Zeus, and Theodoros Anagnostes claims that the first painter to produce one suffered a withered arm in consequence, although the church’s rapid acceptance of the style is demonstrated by the painter’s recovery after the intercession of Archbishop Gennadios. The Image of Edessa appears about a hundred years later, although legend has since given it earlier, spurious, provenance. Back to Ron. Nowhere in the bible does it appear that Jesus’s scourging was ‘excessive.’ Only John even mentions scourging, and Luke implies that Jesus was given more of a token punishment – a chastisement, as some translations have it. Matthew and Mark refer more to a general beating up than a judicial punishment. A list of Jewish Messiahs can be found by typing in ‘Jewish Messiahs’ in Google, and Josephus’s mentions of crucifixion by typing in ‘Josephus Crucifixion.’ I should be interested if Ron can find a link to a single one of his ‘most archaeologists’ who think mass open graves were a feature of first century Palestine. Either way he seems to disagree with them himself by quoting Josephus, who says that Jews took particular care of their dead and buried them before nightfall. [and how about this for a frivolous coincidence? Look at the left hand of the statue of Zeus preserved in Leningrad, and then at the right hand of almost any pantocrator. Wouldn’t it be funny if that peculiar ‘blessing’ gesture, of some fingers curled around an invisible staff and others pointing upwards, in fact derived from a statue, transported from Olympia to Byzantium, which was missing its spear.

He then considers what his correspondent calls the ‘path length dependent attenuation of the concentration,’ but without, I feel, much enthusiasm, considering various surface factors to be more important.

I think Nickell’s conclusions are summed up in his article, “Claims of Invalid “Shroud” Radiocarbon Date Cut from Whole Cloth”, on the http://www.csicop.org website, although he has restated them in various other articles since then. Before I address Nickell, there is something a bit worrying about your own post, if I may be so brave. Atheists are directing Christians to Nickell? This casts so many aspersions it is difficult to know where to begin. Atheists are all duplicitous? Christians are all stupid? The Shroud constitutes a watershed between atheism and Christianity? I’m not sure what to make of it myself. Anyway, back to Nickell, whose 2005 article began as a rebuttal of Rogers’s Thermochimica Acta paper. “Ray Rogers, a retired research chemist, now admits there is the equivalent of a watercolor paint on the alleged burial cloth of Jesus.” This is deliberately provocative, of course. Nickell knows perfectly well that Rogers insisted that the material with the dye and water soluble gum on was not part of the original cloth, and that even if it was, the radiocarbon sample is nowhere near where there would be any ‘watercolor paint’ anyway. This attitude continues throughout the article, and I don’t want to pursue it here. I would advise readers (especially all those gullible Christians who do what atheists tell them) to look up the primary sources (there we go again) and decide for themselves, but not to fall into the trap which Nickell appears to have fallen into himself, that of thinking that simply by discrediting one’s opponent’s evidence for their hypothesis, one somehow provides evidence for one’s own. Much of what N Ickell says is not necessarily incorrect. I don’t think it wise to disparage Walter Mc Crone too much. In some ways he was not unlike Ray Rogers, and their characters were such that it is not surprising that they first became friends, nor that they later fell out. Both were scrupulous scientists widely respected in their fields, both founded ongoing successful scientific journals, and both sporadically drove people mad by their attitudes and practices. Which of them was the more correct in their conclusions regarding the Shroud is still an open question..","date":"2015-09-10","mins":"4:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/08/new-youtuibe-presentation-is-the-shroud-of-medieval-forgery/","cat":"presentation","title":"New YouTube Presentation:  Is the Shroud a Medieval Forgery?"},{"id":"comment-209943","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Try http://shroud.com/pdfs/n79part8.pdf !.","date":"2015-09-09","mins":"5:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/08/new-youtuibe-presentation-is-the-shroud-of-medieval-forgery/","cat":"presentation","title":"New YouTube Presentation:  Is the Shroud a Medieval Forgery?"},{"id":"comment-209979","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Professor Marinelli’s paper is an an excellent review of the evidence, but does not comment or evaluate it very thoroughly. She does have the advantage of Max Frei’s articles in Italian, which seem to have been more comprehensive than his account in Shroud Spectrum International, but I do not think they clarify the case. To review a little of what Frei is quoted as having said: “The tapes are put in contact with a light pressure, and, due to their stickiness, when they are detached, they remove all the microtraces without damaging or altering the support in any way.” — If Frei changed his tactics between 1973 and 1978, when he applied the tapes with such force the S Tu RP team were horrified, then there should be a big difference between the amount of debris on them. If a light pressure was all that was needed in 1973, why did he change his modus operandi in 1978? “The advantage of this method, widely used in criminology, is that – once the tape is folded on itself – loss of material or secondary contamination are completely excluded.” — Fine, but he didn’t fold the tapes in on themselves; he stuck them to microscope slides, as in the photos at http://llanoestacado.org/freeinquiry//skeptic/shroud/as/schafersman.html. “In subsequent analyses of dust samples it was possible to find and classify a large number of pollen grains which, properly treated, have allowed the precise determination of the family, genus and species of the plant itself.” — It is not true that pollen is classifiable at species level even today, and was even less so 40 years ago. “Each identification result was checked on herbarium material and in botanical gardens worldwide renowned for their collections, as well as documented in photomicrographic surveys.” — I’m afraid that without proper documentation I simply don’t believe this. In the absence of adequate comparison material Frei went to places he thought were relevant and collected his own. Whether he made a micrographical survey is open to doubt. And so on. Antero’s last comment reads “… Professors Danin and Baruch who confirmed many of Frei’s taxonomical pollen classification at least at genus level.” Really? Prof. Danin has changed his mind about the validity of any of Frei’s findings.. In 1998 he wrote (http://www.shroud.com/danin2.htm): “Dr. Uri Baruch, palynologist with the Israel Antiquities Authority who made his M.SC. And Ph.D. Dissertations on the flora of Israel, analyzed most of Frei’s 1973 sticky tape pollen specimens and ten of the twenty five 1978 sticky tapes. He examined 165 pollen grains, of which 45 (27.3%) were Gundelia tournefortii.” But in 2011, he wrote (http://flora.org.il/en/books/plant stories 2/chapter o/useful plants 06/): “The sample we used in our previous publications is the grain presented on the left side of Fig. 15.2.2. [a single ‘Shroud’ pollen previously identified as Gundelia tournefortii]. At first sight one can say that it has “thorns” similar to those on the right side of Fig. 15.2.2. [a group of modern pollen identified as Gundelia tournefortii]. However, looking more thoroughly, one can see that the “thorns” of the right photograph are more pointed and denser compared to the “thorns” in the left photograph. The right photograph is of grains taken from a Gundelia tournefortii flowers. It is not the same as the grain on the left.” and “Prof. Litt concluded that none of the pollen grains he saw could be named at a species level. Hence, all the conclusions drawn from previous palynological investigations of Dr. Frei’s material should be suspended until a new collection of pollen grains can be carried out and the grains thus obtained can be studied with modern equipment and by an expert of pollen of this area.” and finally “Since writing [Prof. Litt’s] conclusions in 2001 no pollen grains have been collected and investigated as he suggested, so the data concerning pollen grains should not be used in Shroud research.” Matthew L., may I offer a word of advice? In researching your article, although you may want to use Charles’s, my own or Antero’s suggestions as gateways, always go right back to primary sources wherever you can, and make your own decisions based on them, rather than merely quoting the opinions of others. Charles, and ‘his’ author, do not believe the Shroud can be authentic at all. Antero, and ‘his’ author, are confirmed authenticists, and I (of course) am completely unbiased (yes, all right, don’t laugh…).

However, the Shroud is not a hologram, in any of the various senses of the word. It is true that a partial three dimensional form (either material, such as Jackson’s cardboard layers, or virtual, as a digital database in a computer) can be constructed from the image on the shroud, and that holograms can be made from three dimensional forms, but that does not mean that the two dimensional image is a hologram, and more than any other two dimensional image is a hologram. Soons’ holograms are not derived from the image on the Shroud, but from Bernardo Galmarini’s digital three dimensional form of that image. And that requires a great deal more explanation than is given on Soons’ website. It seems to be a truism that the intensity of the image at any one place appears to be inversely related to a distance between a body and a shroud. However the nature of this inverse relationship is far from obvious, and depends on the position of the body, the position of the shroud, and precisely what is meant by the ‘distance between the two’ (vertical, perpendicular to the cloth, perpendicular to the body, the shortest distance between a point on the body and a point on the cloth, or vice versa). Having established that, one must then determine whether the intensity/distance relationship is linear, exponential, quadratic or something else. These factors are not part of the shroud and must be inferred by the ‘sculptor’ based, I’m afraid, on what he thinks the final form should look like, not on any objective data on the image itself. It would be interesting to give a sculptor an ordinary full face photograph of someone, and ask them to produce a three dimensional face from it. How wildly inaccurate would it be?

They begin their investigations by assuming that the image is of a dead body, and working from there. There would be no point in doing anything different. However their interpretations of what they observe are sufficiently different for us to recognise a certain subjectivity about their observations, and other interpretations of the size and posture of the body which might have produced the image have also been very different. On calcium, R.A. Morris of the S Tu RP team identified the calcium by X Ray Fluorescence. He discussed it in some detail, and was of the opinion that it was surface contamination, because the areal densities of calcium and strontium across the Shroud were very similar to the densities of the same elements found on the Holland cloth. He goes on to say: “Both calcium and strontium are relatively common elements. For instance, we might expect considerable quantities of airborne Ca C03 from the rich marble and limestone regions of northern Italy. In igneous rocks strontium occurs as a substitutional element for calcium and potassium in plagioclase and potash feldspars respectively. These minerals are both quite susceptible to weathering and represent major sources of clay in some areas. Although other explanations are possible, the uniform calcium and strontium distributions might be explained simply as dust accumulations.” However, Morris acknowledge that there might be additional calcium deeper among the fibres, which did not register on his spectra because: “X ray attenuation by hydrocarbons is greatest at lower energies and in these measurements would strongly suppress the calcium peak. We measured an attenuation of approximately 75% for Ca Ka X rays through 20 mg cm S2 cellulose.

Although I deplore any vicious personal attacks and obscene language directed towards anyone, I fear that Louis’ paper is unlikely to rehabilitate Prof. Fanti in the eyes of those who think him discredited. Let’s start with the task of demonstrating the truth of the Resurrection. ” It will have to be demonstrated beyond doubt that the image formation was near instantaneous, if not instantaneous, a task that can be easily handled by both Professor Giulio Fanti and Professor Paolo di Lazzaro.” A task that can be easily handled? Hmmm. The reason given for near instantaneousness being that all Jesus’s miracles were instantaneous. Really? What about the feeding of the five thousand? Or walking on water? Hmmm. Then we move on to demonstrating that the Shroud has been reliably dated to the 1st century AD by three different dating methods. These were publicised in his book ‘Il Mistero della Sindone,’ and soundly criticised to such an extent that the paper based on it later submitted for peer review did not mention the Shroud of Turin at all, and excluded the multi parametric mechanical analysis entirely. The Shroud has certainly not been “reliably dated” to the 1st century AD. Next we find that criticism about the provenance of his Shroud fibres was unjustified because “I made it clear that that the samples were among those taken by STURP in 1978 and considered authentic by the previous papal custodian, Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini, who encouraged me in my Turin Shroud studies,” and in the paragraph below Louis says, “You received the fibres from the same sample in the possession of Shroud scientist Ray Rogers.” In fact of course Fanti’s own book makes it perfectly clear that he was testing “le polveri aspirate nel prelievo ufficiale del 1978 sul lenzuolo torinese dalla zona dell’immagine dei glutei” and (although I could have missed it) I find no mention of Rogers’ fibres at all. S Tu RP, of course, disassociated themselves from Giovanni Riggi’s vacuum cleaner experiments, and neither considered them nor mentioned them in their subsequent investigations. The samples taken by S Tu RP were tape extractions directly from the surface of the Shroud. Riggi’s hooverings came from between the Shroud and the backing cloth. Then we move on to the idea that the entire radiocarbon sample, and a larger area around it, was part of a 13th century patch, which consequently dated to the 13th century when radiocarbon tested. Mechtilde Flury Lemberg did not notice any such patch. “Perhaps Dr. Flury Lemberg was looking possible discontinuities, some traces of workmanship, caused by the junction between the main Shroud and a possible patch in an area very close to the location from where the 1988 sample was cut. It appears that she did not go beyond that area.” No, it doesn’t. It appears that there is no evidence for a large patch. Now we wander off track, discussing the Bari conference and digressing briefly into the theory of evolution. “Evolution is frequently referred to as though it is something that can explain why Man is on Earth, especially by some biologists, but that is not true. It involves huge problems and explanations are needed. It is the means used by atheists to “demonstrate” that God is not necessary, but they fail when it comes to many points, which are frequently hidden from the public.” Oh, dear. Here we go again. The implication, of course, being that anybody who believes in evolution is an atheist. Including the previous two popes, I suppose, so it puts me in good company. Once again (see an earlier post) not believing that the Shroud is authentic is prima facie evidence for atheism. Back to the Shroud, and DNA. Especially from 24 identified plants (listed on page 183 of Il Mistero della Sindone). Guess how many of these were identified by Max Frei on his pollen tapes. Just two. And where are Scheuermann’s Chysanthemum, or Avinoam Danin’s “continuous carpet” of Matricaria, or Anthemis, or Gundelia, or Zygophyllum, or Thomas Litt’s Carduus? Is this evidence of anything? What does Prof. Fanti say? “The recent results of dusts vacuumed from the TS confirm the data obtained by Frei Sulzer; the fragments of pollen grains on the relic detected by me match the results published by him.” Well, they don’t, do they. Wandering off again, we visit the Jospice mattress and a handkerchief with paintings of Padre Pio on one side and Jesus on the other that I am not familiar with. “According to Professor Pietro Baraldi of Modena University the image is made of no substance known on earth.” Wooo. Sorry for the length.

I have never defended such a position, and do not think the Jospice mattress was the work of an artist. Perhaps he was thinking of someone else. He also says I “did not comment about Professor Fanti’s DNA findings because they go against his argument that the Shroud is fake.” This is untrue. I did not comment on Fanti’s finding because I do not know enough about them. As I said. He also says that “Hugh apparently doubts that God is not subject to time.” This is untrue. It is precisely because God is not subject to time that it is absurd to insists that this or that miracle “has to be” instantaneous. A true miracle worker could surely make it happen as quickly or as slowly as he wished. Hugh “also says that the Resurrection did not have to be an instantaneous process. He apparently says that because he is afraid what Professor Fanti and Dr. Di Lazzaro will discover.” This is untrue. The Resurrection does not have to be an instantaneous process because, not being subject to time, God could have made it last as long as he wished. And, in his later post, “Editor Hugh was unable to answer some of the important questions I asked him.” This is untrue. Louis did not ask me any important questions. Shall I list them? a) Does someone who believes in God also believe that He was created after the big bang? b) And what was Father Francis O’Leary doing meanwhile? Having a nice English breakfast, complete with coffee, eggs and sausages? c) [Are the DNA studies] also rubbish? d) Do I have to dwell on Freud here? e) Why would Jesus have to wait for the disciples to bring the fishes and loaves of bread and then, say, with a gesture, fill the bellies of the 5000 hungry mouths without waiting for them to eat? That would be funny wouldn’t it? That’s five somewhat blatant untruths in two comments. Coupled to the nine I listed earlier, none of which have been denied, I wonder whether Louis’ support for Prof. Fanti’s work isn’t proving a bit of a two edged sword. I have no doubt that as Daveb has suggested, Prof. Fanti is no less well informed concerning the properties of the Shroud than a science teacher, and I wish his endeavours every success.

Shroudscope is a debating forum, where opinions and ideas are presented and discussed, for all the world to read. I rarely address any correspondent directly, precisely because my views are addressed to all the readers of this forum, not simply to the individual whose views I am debating. Nor do I try to guess what is going on in the minds of those I respond to; I reply to their words, not to their thoughts. Louis does make one sensible point above, which is that he is quite correct that I like to examine, in extreme detail, any evidence regarding the Shroud, and am usually prepared to go to some length to do so. I did buy Il Mistero della Sindone, and Prof. Fanti’s subsequent paper in Vibratonal Spectroscopy, and have commented on them at length, but must confess I have not shelled out the necessary for Sindone: Primo Secolo Dopo Cristo! as I really don’t know that it will be worth it. Like the previous book, it appears to be aimed at a popular market and as such will probably present conclusions rather than a good account of the research that led up to them. If a more detailed paper on the DNA findings can be found anywhere I will be pleased to review it for this forum. Meanwhile, we have Prof. Fanti’s quoted replies to Louis’ questions above. “When it comes to human mitochondrial DNA, distinct haplogroups have been identified, including R0, U2 and U5, and several H haplotypes. Haplogroup R0 occurs frequently in the Arabian plateau, especially in the local populations of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan with its highest frequency in Yemen (30%), whereas the highest frequency of haplogroup R8 is found mainly towards East India. U sub groups are widely distributed across Western Eurasia, North Africa and South Asia. The human mitochondrial haplogroups we found are compatible with the proposed temporal and spatial paths of the TS and the findings and additional clues present difficulties to those who postulate a Central European origin of the relic.” This statement in itself explains why I can honestly say I don’t know much about it. Among the mitochondrial haplotypes identified, some are thought to originate from the Middle East 60000 years ago. This tells us nothing. A huge proportion of Europeans and Americans would have the same. In order to comment sensibly, one would need a complete list of the haplotypes discovered, and the proportions in which they were found. Suppose, to set an extreme example, 90% of the haplotypes were H1b, and 10% from R0, U2 and U5 – that would be a good indication that the Shroud had never been handled by Hebrews or Turks at all, and is not ruled out by the statement quoted. The final clause: “additional clues present difficulties to those who postulate a Central European origin of the relic,” is interesting. I wonder what the ‘additional clues’ are. Perhaps they are indicative, perhaps not.

You’re quite right. Although I do I “rarely address any correspondent directly,” there are occasions when I do; sometimes this is in answer to a particular request (such as ‘ Where can I find a copy of this paper or that’ or ‘I want an explanation’ as above) which is probably known to other readers, sometimes to welcome someone who I do not remember having responded to before, and sometimes to make it clear to whose post I am responding, when there have been several commenters over a short space of time. I expect there are exceptions, but that’s my general practice, it seems. As for your theology, Louis, I have indeed read it carefully, and it has tangled itself up into such a muddle that you might do well to re read it yourself. First you claimed that all Jesus miracles were instantaneous, not qualified by saying “only cures,” except for two blind men, who were kept waiting. When I mentioned the loaves and the fishes, you realised how absurd the sudden production of 5000 lunches appears, and said the ‘nature’ miracles didn’t count, and when I asked why any miracles ‘had to be’ instantaneous, you took refuge in asking whether I thought Jesus liked people to suffer. Did he make them wait? Well, yes, he did. Not only the two blind men you yourself quoted previously, but in the case of Lazarus, to the extreme distress of his relatives, for four days. Louis, my friend, I am a scientist to the core, and a Catholic to the core, educated largely by Benedictine monks, and will not be caught out by trivial theological sophistry. Go back to your ideas about miracles and clarify them to yourself, and when you know what you want to say, you may be able to explain clearly why the Resurrection “had to be” instananeous.

So the Resurrection “had to be” not quite instantaneous because Jesus “must have taken a few seconds” to power up. Perhaps you are correct. The God I believe in does not have to take any time at all. He may have allowed himself to revive over 36 hours, individual cells reawakening in succession until he simply got up as from a bed, or he may have vanished in an instant, the space he occupied being as instantly filled with air, or left as a vacuum, or he may have exploded in a burst of radiation, which was just enough to have an effect on the Shroud. He may have caused the dead of Jerusalem to do any of the same, and then sent them all back to their graves, or he may have made the people of Jerusalem think they had seen their forebears when in fact they had remained peacefully in their ossuaries. He may have reconstituted himself instantly, and sat in the garden for the rest of the night waiting for Mary Magdalene to turn up, or he may have not reappeared until just before she arrived. Somewhere along the way he provided clothes for himself. Perhaps while he was still in the tomb, perhaps after he re materialised. He may have done any, all or none of these things. That’s who God is. From a scientific point of view, none of them is open to inquiry. I do not know what the Resurrection was scientifically, or how long it took. Nor does anybody else, nor does it matter. In 1984 the Anglican Bishop of Durham attempted to explain this in describing the resurrection as “so much more than a conjuring trick with bones” and a few years ago Pope Benedict showed a similar lack of enthusiasm for “the mere resussitation of a corpse.” Frankly, in the opinion of most modern theologians, all as orthodox as the Pope, the measurable, physical events of the morning of the first day of the week after the crucifixion are trivial compared to the meaning of the Resurrection and the effect it had on the disciples, whatever actually occurred.

Stepping out of my depth here, but when did that stop me before? When somebody uses a word to describe a particular circumstance, it is natural to assume they were using a word particularly appropriate to that circumstance, and so, if there is an appropriate English word, to use that in translation, regardless of what the original word meant to the person who used it. Any cloth used in connection with a tomb may thus be assumed to mean ‘shroud,’ ‘grave clothes,’ ‘winding sheet’ or similar. However it is not clear to me that there is a Greek word which is particular to a cloth in a tomb. Searching for a Greek word meaning ‘shroud’ in http://www.lexilogos.com/english/greek ancient dictionary.htm (which uses Liddell & Scott, the dictionary I used as a child among others), I cannot find one. There are references to words meaning ‘shrouded in gloom’ or ‘wearing a black shroud,’ and so on, but these seem to me to be largely figurative. Thus ‘entypazo’ means ‘wrap up’ but not specifically a dead body, and ‘melanonekyoeimon’ means ‘shrouded in black,’ but as far as I can make out the base words are black corpse wearing, with no specific word meaning ‘shroud.’ None of the words given in association with ‘shroud’ is anything like ‘sindon’ or ‘othonia.’ This makes me feel that neither ‘sindon’ nor ‘othonia’ nor, in fact, any other word, had any specific reference to grave clothes, until, being thus applied by the evangelists, they acquired one. So what did ‘sindon’ mean? To find out, we need to look at every example we can. Starting with Herodotus’ Histories, the Babylonians strain their fish stew through sindonos, people sleep wearing clothes or wrapped in sindonos, Egyptian mummifiers wrap bodies in bandages (telamon) made of sindonos, and wounded warriors are tended with the same. Lucian says that the Eyptian God Anubis wears sindosin, and Polybius says armies signalled with coloured sindona. It is fairly clear that the word had no immediate connection with the grave. ‘Othonia’ seems to mean very much the same. People wear it, wave it about, and let the wind blow on it to move their ships. I think therefore, that Charles is perfectly correct in supposing that even a post 33 AD Greek text that refers to sindoni or othonia need not necessarily be referring to grave clothes, but that Daveb is also correct in that in the context of the empty tomb, they almost certainly are referring to grave clothes. The grey area lies in the use of these words in the context of relics, but not specifically in the context of the tomb. It might be argued that since the word othonia only occurs in the bible in the context of the tomb, it carries that context automatically. Sindon is also used for the garment the young man in Gethsemane left behind, so need not, and might refer to a different relic altogether.

Even with the best of intentions, Version 1 comes across as pompous persiflage more than a Scientific consensus. The very first example announces that it is an ‘established fact’ that ‘we cannot appreciate which image is the more evident, front or back.’ What a shame that similar established facts are not more prominent. The second statement (also an ‘established fact’) is gibberish: “The body image has the normal tones of light and dark reversed.” I ask you. Examine your own body. What are your “normal tones?” What would you look like if your “normal tones” were reversed? No, it explains, normal tones are the normal tones of a black and white photograph – except that can’t be true, because the third statement (another ‘established fact’) says the Shroud image doesn’t behave like a normal photograph at all, and uses a VP8 image (which looks exactly like a bas relief) to illustrate the statement that the image density can be correlated to the “clearances between the three dimensional surface of the body and a covering cloth.” Even the most fanatical Shroud authenticist must find it hard not to be embarrassed by such nonsense.

However I’m a little worried by your impression that this blog was for people who believed the Shroud to be authentic. As I understand Dan’s object in supporting it, this blog is for people who want to find out more about the Shroud, authentic or not. From time to time we do get comments like: “It’s obviously authentic, so stop bickering,” and a very few that say: “It’s obviously a fake; get over it.” But as these commenters have little to add to the discussion, they usually don’t stay. Even those who are wholly convinced in principle one way or another contribute variations on the details. The non authenticists are not unanimous on the provenance or manufacturing method, and the authenticists tie themselves up in knots (literally: see recent discussions) about how the Shroud was fixed or draped over the body. Ideas from science, fringe science and frankly whacky science are all grist to the mill, and given an honest review. I have now read several articles from Nature Photonics, and am much more familiar with the work of Seok Hyun Yun and Malte Gather, who published their experiments with light induced laser emission from GFP in living cells in 2011. I can’t find any further research on the subject. Quantum bioholography failed to find any scientific acceptance by the end of the 2000s, and seems by now to have been rejected as a serious study even by its previous adherents. ELF waves, on the other hand, could be a promising field of research and you may find yourself particularly welcomed by daveb, who has long championed Giovanna de Liso’s work on imaging during earthquakes. You are no doubt familiar with the WHO paper: Extremely Low Frequency Fields Environmental Health Criteria Monograph No.238, which leads to some interesting speculation. Colin was quite correct to point out that comparing Joseph Accetta with “a person in a mental institution that keeps banging their head against a wall all day” was a hostile, ignorant and unwarranted attack, but generous enough to suggest that you “hang around.

Such definitive results as were discovered included that the Sudarium dates to 700 AD. Except, of course, that it could be contaminated with oil. Do we have to go through all this again? How much oil would be needed to contaminate it, and why did the carbon dating laboratory firstly not notice it and then say they were unable to remove it? Everybody else can, with fairly simple procedures. Perhaps there was a Soviet spy at work here as well. And what sort of oil? And when. Say modern, say olive, say 15%. That’s a lot of contamination. If from petroleum, of course, it would make the date much older than its real date, not younger. Then we hear that Max Frei had identified pollen. Again? Really? Is his report available? Is, it, like his Shroud report, so specific as to species as to call his entire oeuvre into question? I read, repeated on the internet 60 times, that pollen from “Quercus caliprimus” was found on the Sudarium, a tree that only grows in Israel. Only there’s no such plant. It’s Quercus calliprinos (the Palestine oak), and it grows from Northern Algeria to Turkey and beyond. It is so closely related to Quercus coccifera that I have no doubt its pollen is indistinguishable from it. Quercus coccifera grows commonly in Spain.

Producing a minute surface discolouration of a cloth with a high powered laser is interesting but certainly does not lead to any logical conclusion about the origin of the image on the shroud. And I’m interested in your “not widely known but established scientific facts.” This is contrary to the nature of a scientific “fact,” if such there be. Science establishes its norms precisely by making them widely known, and consequently accepted. Miller, Webb and Dickson’s vague and unsubstantiated hypotheses of Quantum or Embryonic Bioholography are certainly not established facts, and neither is any of the subsequent dogma about the body being a crystal and so on. “Human DNA is made up of a gel like liquid crystal that can emit microscopic laser light. That is a fact, that is not speculation.” That is certainly not a fact. It is wholly untested. In this context, it is not even obvious what is meant by “microscopic,” or “laser,” or even “light.” There are good, widely known and widely accepted definitions of these words, none of which currently apply to any results achieved from experimentation with DNA. “Bottom Line: Russ B’s Image Formation theory is correct: Jesus was lit up like a Christmas Tree. That is the only remaining possibility.” No, it’s not. The point perhaps is not that these ideas are bunkum from start to finish – for all I know they may be absolutely spot on – the point is that without wide acceptance, and in particular experimental or observational evidence, they cannot be distinguished from the little green alien, the giant spaghetti monster or the Soviet plot, and tend to place their adherents at the far fringes of scientific recognition rather than in the forefront they so passionately think they deserve..","date":"2014-06-04","mins":"4:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/04/anticipating-the-conference-joseph-accetta-on-14th-century-origins/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Anticipating the Conference: Joseph Accetta on 14th Century Origins"},{"id":"comment-126834","author":"hugh_farey","post":"An interesting article indeed, but wholly irrelevant to the shroud.

Few of these remarks are as black and white as they are represented here, and the weight attributed to their relevance is indeed somewhat subjective. So, the conclusions I seem to have come to: 1) Yes, the waiving of the protocols was a pity, and caused a lot of bother, but it has no relevance to the actual dating procedure. 2) Results from a single sample are satisfactory as long as it is representative. It is true that this has been seriously questioned, but it not true that it has been discredited. On the whole, I find insufficient reason to doubt that the sample was indeed representative. 3) The chi squared test is a measure of similarity, it not something you pass or fail. If there is a 95% or greater chance that two results are of the same provenance, the hypothesis that they are is, by convention, considered established. If the chance is is less than 95%, then the hypothesis is not considered formally established. This is not the same as saying that it has been disproved. The figure for the Shroud is 94%. 4) Riani and Atkinson’s chronological gradient is significant, and indicates some discrepancy along the length of the radiocarbon sample strip. It does not discredit a medieval date at all, nor demand any interweaving, although some contamination may be possible. 5) Rogers’s discovery of various contaminents may contribute to an understanding of the chronological gradient described above, but is not in itself any evidence of an interweave. Some of his conclusions, such as the use of a water soluble gum, lack credibility. 6) The reasons I do not believe in the reweaving are described above and in detail elsewhere. It has not been demonstrated at all. 7) The presence or absence of vanillin could be significant, as I have already said. 8) Gilbert Raes discovered no differences between his sample and the Shroud. Later studies on the Shroud itself have attempted to show that the cotton content, if any, of the rest of the Shroud does not match that of the Raes sample. Whether the cotton is relevant or not is, as I have said above and many times before, dependant on rather better estimations of its quantity and location than have been determined so far.

Similarly, two other textile ‘experts’ handling the material itself, found no evidence that the radiocarbon sample was not representative. Anybody scanning Shroud 2.0 can see that the cloth is far from homogeneous; it is pulled and tugged, and there are obvious stitch holes and extraneous material. None of this, to the eyes of any textile ‘experts’ demonstrates that the radiocarbon samples were unrepresentative. Now it is well known that I have no truck with the ‘my expert is better than your expert’ argument, and insist that they do not pronounce, but explain their pronouncements.

As the Nature paper, and you, have correctly pointed out, my last sentence in this section should read “The figure for the Shroud is considerably less.” (I’m guessing about 85%). However, my principle point remains the same. Assuming the same sample was being tested, the probability of obtaining the Shroud results by chance is only 1 in 20. This is not a very high probability, and it falls below the chi squared 0.05 value of 5.99 (95% sure that the values are from the same sample). As I say, this means that the hypothesis that the measurements are from the same sample is not considered formally established. This is not the same as saying that it has been disproved. As I say above, there is still a good chance that they are. I cannot agree with your next point, which is that the Riani/Atkinson findings mean that the medieval date must be rejected altogether. A row of dates along a plank of wood, for example, also show a chronological gradient, but are not, on that basis, rejected altogether. The reasons for the gradient along the wood are different, and better understood, but the principle is the same. Riani and Atkinson’s findings say nothing about the overall accuracy of the date of the Shroud. I do agree that the reason for the chronological gradient is not understood. It may be due to minor contamination, such as a water fast red madder dye added to the Holland cloth to make it match the Shroud. Why Rogers’ water soluble gum would have been applied I can’t understand. As you say, that would have been washed off by the cleaning process. It would also have been washed off by a shower of rain.

What I am querying is the convention of the 95%/5% pass/fail criterion. The 0.05 border between acceptability and rejection is a sensible, if conservative, way of deciding whether a hypothesis should be accepted or rejected. If rejected, of course, that does not mean it is wrong, simply that it has not been confirmed to be right, by this convention. This is exactly the case with the Shroud, and presumably the reason why the peer reviewers of the article in Nature did not reject the results out of hand. [Semi relevant illustration. My father was a quality assurance officer for Royal Naval ordnance. For him, the 0.05 convention was far too lax, given the possible outcome of an unpredicted explosion. I have a feeling that his pass/fail criterion was 99.9%/0.01%, or 0.001. It may have been tighter still.] “We know that there is a row of dates along a plank of wood, because trees grow for several years – contrary to the Shroud.” Yes, of course. My point is that three furniture dates of 500, 505 and 510 years, found from samples along the length of a piece of wood, are not rejected out of hand as the ‘contamination’ of more recent C14 is well explained. Further investigation into the Shroud might permit one to assess (oh, alright, guess) the maximum level of contamination (rather less than the 60% required to make a 1st century cloth give a 13th century date), and therefore the youngest possible age of the youngest section, from which, given the date spread, the age of the other two sections could be calculated. I would be happy to give a worked illustration of this if anyone thought it worthwhile. But your last bit is not reasonable. Rogers identified a water soluble gum, which does not, to me, make sense. I do not know why anybody would put water based paint on an area he knew would be held by many hands. What, I ask myself, was the gum for? I confess that this area of speculation was brought on by pondering on Roger’s discovery of red madder and this gum. He thought that the madder was a dye on interpolated threads, to make them look more like the Shroud. I can’t find any interpolated threads, so I speculated that the madder was a dye on the Holland cloth, to make that look more like the Shroud. Certainly a photo of the area after the radiocarbon sample has been removed is much paler than the exposed part – although some have suggested that this is due to a light induced darkening of the Holland cloth with age.

Not even Jesus’ nudity. I think this is a question of social convention and taboo. I haven’t quantified this, but I guess that a naked Jesus occurs more often in books than it does in public display. The biggest taboo, however, was (is) not nudity but genitalia, and with few, perhaps deliberately provocative, exceptions (eg Michelangelo), even when Jesus is clearly nude, some diaphanous wisp of material, or the angle of his legs, or his hands, preserve his modesty. Buttocks, I think, were not a problem, but rarely appear – on anybody – because a picture of someone shows his front, not his back. Obviously, if a decision were taken to have a front and back portrait (which is, I agree, probably unique in early art) of a naked man, then buttocks would be inevitable. 2) I see no kink.

Take the assertion (forgive me Gabriel), that the author of the Letter to the Hebrews has been scientifically identified. The section of the quoted paper which is devoted to Hebrews is entirely uncertain about the identity of the author. One of their research methods makes it closest to Paul, but well outside the range of certainty of the rest of his letters, and another method makes it closest to Luke, but again, with minimal certainty. Their conclusion is: “This would appear to favour the traditional belief that Paul is the author. However, the corresponding Mahalanobis distance is longer than the furthest distance between any of Paul’s known texts and their stylometric average, suggesting the link between Paul and the Letter to the Hebrews is weak.” This is emphatically not a ‘scientific identification.’ The authors then pose two questions: Was Luke involved in a translation? and, Was the letter written by somebody else entirely? These are not ‘conclusions,’ which mark the end of an investigation; they are questions which they hope somebody will use as the beginning of an investigation. The body of texts used to try to identify Paul’s writing style are in Greek. The letter to the Hebrews is in Greek. If Paul normally wrote in Greek, then he didn’t need a translator. If he normally wrote in Hebrew (or Aramaic), then the rest of his work also needed a translator, and the discrepancy between the ‘main corpus’ and Hebrews could simply be a matter of changing translators (John Mark to Luke?). If he normally wrote in Greek, but needed a translator into Hebrew especially for the letter to the Hebrews, then our text (in Greek), if not his original, must be a retranslation back into Greek again. By another translator? Weird. Whatever the solution, Maryam Ebrahimpour et al’s paper does not claim to provide it. Now, moving on to (sorry Yannick) the assertion that the “official teaching of the Catholic Church” is that “the Resurrection should not have left any kind of physical proofs.” Is there any substance for this assertion? As a Catholic myself, I would find it very difficult to accept that the Resurrection didn’t happen at all, although as a scientist I’m personally inclined towards a more metaphorical than literal interpretation of that word. However, if the resurrection was a physical event, then something scientifically explicable but at present unknown must have occurred, and whatever it was may have left traces. Whether Jesus just woke up, pushed off the shroud and walked out, or suddenly dematerialised and rematerialised elsewhere, or exploded in a shower of rainbows, some evidence of what occurred would have remained, and may still be evident today. I would agree with Yannick if he said that the church does not require proof, but to suggest that it positively rejects proof is I think misinformed..","date":"2013-03-03","mins":"6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/the-face-jesus-left-us/","cat":"event","title":"The face Jesus left us"},{"id":"comment-26313","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think the Catholic Church is rather more pragmatic than you suggest.

In this context the term monoatomic (or monatomic) gold is wholly meaningless. There is no such stuff, and it is consequently impossible to treat anything with it.

Being a nutritional supplement, Healing Mountain is obliged to list the ‘ingredients’ of its “MONATOMIC WHITE POWDER GOLD M State ORMUS 20g most POTENT Form.” This is what it says: Nutritional Information.

I do not believe they exist. Nevertheless, I suppose we have to have a look at it. The first 17 pages are a Chemistry lesson and not patentable. On page 18 we begin a 21 step guide to preparing G ORME. The first 5 steps, involving dissolving gold in acids and then boiling them away results in “substantially pure” Gold Chloride. It would be easier and cheaper to buy it commercially, or to pass chlorine gas over gold powder. Next we add salt and nitric acid and eventually achieve Sodium Gold Nitrate. Why not just buy some Gold Nitrate to start with? We are told that this is monoatomic Sodium Gold Nitrate. There is no justification for this at all, and it does not seem to mean anything anyway. It might mean that we now have more or less pure Sodium Nitrate, with the odd single gold atom relacing the sodium here and there. At least it explains the white colour. Boiling gold powder in Sodium Nitrate solution might have a similar effect anyway. We have reached step 12, and could have saved ourselves the trouble. At step 13 we make sure there is no acid still present, and at step 14 we add water and the p H immediately becomes 1. Not in my laboratory it doesn’t, but in this one the Nitrate disassociates from the Sodium Nitrate leaving… er… Sodium? in water? Bash on, regardless of the chemistry. We now have pure Sodium Gold which immediately becomes hydrolises to Hydrogen Gold. This is white? I don’t think so. Wash off the acid, decompose off the Hydrogen and what have you got? No, not monatomic white gold powder, but exactly the same elemental gold powder you started with. We have reached page 21 and embark on pure alchemy. First we check that a pile of dirt contains no gold. How? Then we mix it with salt, bromide, sulphuric acid and anything else handy and electrolyse it. The result is gold. Sorry Angel, but this is utter tosh. If gold could be extracted that easily there would be huge factories bubbling away all over Arizona grinding out bullion like gravel.

The Instructructions specifically begin with 50mg of pure gold. – “With respect to Sodium Nitrate, it is highly soluble in water; therefore, Hudson would have rid the crude product of Sodium Nitrate.” – Both Gold Chloride and Gold Nitrate are highly soluble in water. Water to a dry mixture of both will create a solution of both; some unreacted gold might remain. – “Yes, the p H would be 1, because the nitrate is still attached prior to the addition of water. Nitrates are very acidic.” – No, nitrates are common salts. When dissolved in water they do not produce acidic solutions. – “So, this step, adding water, dissociates the nitrate and it is indicated a small amount of nitric acid still remains.” – What does this mean? There was no acid to start with, and there will be no acid remaining. – “Therefore, the solution should still be acidic to some degree.” – No, it isn’t. Most common garden fertilizers contain nitrates. Why not dissove some and test it with a p H tester? – “The Na Au hydrolyzes with the water and dissociates to form H Au.” – No, it doesn’t. No, it won’t. Evn if it did no light grey H Au will be formed as H Au is extremely unstable and decomposes to gold at the drop of a hat. There is nothing in any of the above to suggest that monoatomic gold is formed. – “I fail to see where you are getting a pile of dirt on page 21.” – A frivolous way of saying “300g of dried material” which is what Hudson starts his electroylsis with. – “There is no dirt and there should be at least a gold atom, since Hudson started with gold.” – No, I have moved on to the Electrolysis Experiment, which specifically starts with “material assayed by conventional techniques to show no gold present.” – “Unless I’m missing something, the experimental procedure appears to be correct. One would have to repeat the experiment to see if the final product is obtained.” – You can indeed carry out all the steps in the experimental procedure. What you can’t do is interpret the results of he chemical procedure in the manner described. A flick through You Tube shows lots of people churning out ‘mono atomic gold’ in their kitchens. None of their final products is anything of the kind. – “Any patent involving superconductivity has to be approved by the Department of Defense before it can be issued….. So it was sent to the Department of Defense. They refused to let me file world wide.” – This is flim flam. Hudson doesn’t claim a US patent, but he does claim an Australian and a British one, both of which do not exist. US Patents are regularly granted for advances in superconductivity which work. Any rejection of Hudson’s applications was not for some implied secret defence reason, but because it is nonsense. – “He speaks of the Middle East and the Egyptians and this monoatomic gold powder that is a superconductor and may have been how Jesus levitated.” – So he does, and so do dozens of similar people with mystical ideas and no evidence. Enough already. I have diverted further from the Shroud than I would have wished, although following my credo that if flim flam is not discredited, its adherents claim that the very lack of discreditation is some form of acknowledgement.
