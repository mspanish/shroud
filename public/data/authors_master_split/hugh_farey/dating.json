There is no doubt that ‘almost invisible’ re weaving exists, and there is an excellent London firm that specialises in it. However, the term ‘invisible’ is not meant to mean that such a repair is wholly undetectable, and Benford and Marino’s blurred pictures of large areas of tapestry are not convincing evidence that it is. Look, at as high a magnification as you can, at the Schwortz photo above. Is it uniform? Or is about half of it different from the other half – either in two separate areas, or simply half the threads whereever they are, are different from the others? Or is it fortuitously true that this sample is in fact all old, or all new? Rogers’s famous splice, which was subsequently analysed by Villarreal, shows two bits of cotton butt joined together and glued with a darker coloured water soluble gel. Can you see anything like this in the sample above? As for the banding, I think the distinct continuity of the weft threads, at least, would be shown in the “transmitted light” photos taken by Barrie Schwortz, and the “X ray” photos taken at the same time by the STURP team.

Some ideas have been quietly dropped in the face of clearer evidence to the contrary. The “bioplastic film” hypothesis of Garza Valdez and Mattingly was a good idea for its time, but is generally rejected now, and John Jackson’s CO enrichment hypothesis failed in the face of actual experiment. Benford and Marino’s “patch” hypothesis, in its literal meaning, in which one side of a herringbone spine was 1st century and the other side was 14th century, has been modified to the “interweave” or “reweave” hypothesis, although opinion is still divided as to whether this involves the interweaving of new threads alongside old threads for at least a part of the mending and strengthening process (for which there should be, but is not, visible evidence), or whether the old threads have been unravelled for a small length and new threads spliced into them and glued with terpene, and then the whole section rewoven to be truly invisible. In view of the unrealistic intricacy of this work, and the fact that it would be a unique mend in the history of textile repair, and the generally shoddy nature of all the other repair and maintenance of the Shroud, this is also rejected by many, although Rogers, Heimburger and Fanti’s Vanillin and Cotton findings continue to keep the possibility alive. Jackson is currently wedded to some kind of nuclear enrichment process, and has no need of any interweave or contamination hypothesis, which he rejects on two connected grounds, firstly that photos of the area show uninterrupted threads and groups of threads (bands) extending right through the radiocarbon area, and secondly, that therefore there is no evidence of the 60% or so medieval material necessary to provide the skewed date. One other argument against medieval contamination has also been put forward by various people, which is that the coincidence of having exactly the right amount of contamination to provide a date exactly matching the first undisputed mention of the Shroud’s existence is too great to accept. Now, what was the question? Oh yes….. Good authenticists, like good non authenticists, do not “just ignore” evidence which goes against their current thinking. On the contrary, they welcome it, as it provides the “proof of the pudding” which, if they can explain it, strengthens their case, and if they can’t explain it, suggests opportunities for further research.

His (and other) explanations for this are somewhat sketchy, but seem to depend on the idea that the cloth/air interface is significant, while the thickness of the cloth itself is not. Presumably the neutron or proton bombardment hypothesis would suggest that the energy of these particles would be absorbed quickest at the cloth/air interface too, and thus mark only the surfaces of the cloth.

The EIGHT ‘dependent’ dates were combined in FOUR “independent dates.” Arizona seems to have set aside the thinnest piece of the two samples it received, and cut the other one in half. According to Marino and Benford’s patch hypothesis, Figure 2, one of these halves was pure patch, and the other one mostly shroud, with a little bit of patch at the top. One of these halves was set aside (later to be studied by Freer Waters). The other half was cut into four, and these four samples independently burnt and reduced to little carbon pellets. At least two of these pellets were either pure shroud or pure patch. Each pellet was subjected to two “sputterings.” There were thus eight actual readings from the four samples tested. Each sample had its two readings averaged, to produce the four “independent dates.” Had there been a 16th century patch over a 1st century cloth, as speculated by Benford and Marino, then at lest two of these dates would have been pure 16th century or pure 1st century. This is not borne out by the published dates. Incidentally, it was good of the Arizona crowd to submit both their dates for each sample.

How wonderful it would be if we could spot the original behind any particular convention, and observe how its influence spread out both geographically and temporally. Unfortunately, this is very rarely possible, and anybody’s interpretation is open to dispute. The Christ Pantocrator is sometimes supposed to have been modelled on the statue of Zeus at Olympia, which may have moved to Constantinople in the 5th century, and representations of the holy sepulchre as a box rather than a temple may derive from Constantine Monomachus’s rebuilding work in Jerusalem. Although the transitions are gradual, the young beardless Christ and the temple sepulchre disappear completely, replaced by their substitutes. The same cannot be said of any of the putative shroud derived iconography. Naked Christs, whip, nail and spear wounds appear sporadically here and there, among various other interpretations, on and off for hundreds of years. Depictions of shrouds themselves are particularly inconsistent. In the paragraph above, I have implied that artistic conventions derive from a particular image, but of course they may also derive from literature, in which case it would be more possible for images unrelated to each other nevertheless to look the same. To take John’s specific iconographical details: 1) Nails through the wrists. Whatever the shroud shows, very few artists have copied it. This is not evidence that the shroud was known about before the 13th century. 2) The crown of thorns. Barbet was probably the first to suggest that the shroud shows a cap rather than a wreath. It appears that practically no artist agrees with him, before or after the 13th century. This is not evidence that the shroud was known about before the 13th century. 3) No whip wounds on the chest. Very few images of the flagellation show any wounds at all. Those that do, show wounds all over the chest. This is not evidence that the shroud was known about before the 13th century. It would be foolish to deny that there are some similarities between some aspects of the shroud and some depictions in medieval images.

There’s not enough in the picture above to make me think it’s evidence that the painter knew the shroud, and as usual context is all. Taking Max’s list (incidentally, daveb, I think “both” refers to the psalter and the shroud, not to two images in the psalter): – “Both men are stark naked with long flow of hair in the back. Part of the hair tied up like a pigtail at the back of the head can be made out.” A quick browse through the psalter shows that this illustrator is not at all afraid of nakedness; there are naked bodies throughout, from various angles and in various details. I do not detect a pigtail. Actually I think Max misses a trick here; what is unusual is not that Christ is naked, but that he has his back turned. – “Both have arm(s) bound/crossed in front. Had both no scourge marks on the inner side arms? This cannot be checked today any longer.” Scourgings are usually shown with the hands tied in front. Other configurations are not unusual, but the comparison here is rather weak evidence. – “Both have bloodied furrows/scourged marks in conjunction with two whips with lashes each fitted with doubled (metal) pellets implying two executioners.” The two executioners are not merely implied, they are illustrated. However this configuration (Christ between two men) is hardly artistically improbable, and again, I don’t find it evidence. The two whips do have three thongs each, but they are tipped with one pellet each, not two. There is no depiction of crossed wounds (from both sides) on the body. – “Both have almost feminine curved left hip & thigh (to be called later “the Byzantine curve”)” This is wholly subjective, and I disagree with it. – “Both are/were tied at tibiofibural level with left leg in front of right leg (TS man accurate Forensic description: left leg in front of right leg with rope mark in the tibiofibular fleshes).” There is no evidence at all of a rope injury on the calves of the shroud image. On the shroud image the left leg is not in front of the right leg, the left foot is on top of the right foot, almost 90 degrees from the position of the left foot shown on the psalter. – “Both show a most unnatural/awkward feet position.” The psalter is as good as the artist could manage at the time (drawing feet from the back was particularly difficult). The shroud might seem to need the feet to be tied together to stop them falling away from each other, but it is easy to adopt its pose. – “And last but not least, by means of a very curious tailed Epsilon hand sign each time, the executioner on the left seem to point with his left hand index finger to his own head while the executioner on the right does point to Christ’s head with his left hand index finger too. Both left hand signs cryptically echoe the tailed Epsilon shaped like small blood rivulet we can observe on TS man’s forehead, just above his left eyebrow.” The fingers of the characters throughout this and many other early psalters are indeed very interesting. In many cases they are drawn quite sensibly, and without distortion, but in many others they exhibit the long, almost snaky appearance we see on this picture. They occur throughout the psalter and are not connected with this one image, let alone the epsilon bloodmark. The index finger is unnaturally long, the little finger has an absurd downward curve, and there are often only four fingers on each hand..","date":"2013-10-20","mins":"6:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/20/an-intriguing-9th-century-image-suggestive-of-the-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-max-patrick-hamon/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Intriguing 9th Century Image Suggestive of the Shroud – A Guest Posting by Max Patrick Hamon"},{"id":"comment-48142","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ah now that’s where I disagree.

I’m detecting considerable inconsistency of thought surrounding this contentious issue. Judging from what I can understand of the ‘patch hypothesis,’ a small section of the shroud had become so threadbare that fewer than one quarter of it survived. Into this was woven, invisibly even under magnification, replacement threads of a different colour. Although the interweaving was invisible, the difference in colour was apparent, so a water soluble pigment, combined with a water soluble plant gum for adhesion, was smeared over the cloth to make the new area match the old perfectly. If this description is incorrect, I hope one of the exponents of the ‘patch hypothesis’ will correct it. As it is, however, I’m surprised that even under close scrutiny, closer perhaps even than that of Flury Lemburg, no evidence of the interwoven threads can be seen in the area immediately adjacent to the sample excision. I infer that the patching must have been confined to the 7mm or so closest to the side strip. I consider that curious. Now for the paint. Rogers uses the word dye, which confused me for a while. A dye in its ordinary meaning is deeply absorbed into the structure of its substrate, and does not form a ‘coating’ and does not need a ‘gum.’ It is not affected by water, sweat, etc. A water soluble paint is rather an odd choice to use to colour a corner of the shroud which is heavily handled. I consider that curious. In a twill cloth, a patch smeared with thick paint has two distinct sides. Every thread is three quarters painted and one quarter unpainted on one side, and three quarters unpainted and one quarter painted on the other side. Although we cannot see all around Thread No. 7 in John Brown’s photograph, what we can see does not conform easily to this description. I consider that curious. There is a relevant corollary, albeit wholly unconnected to any ‘patch.’ Flury Lemburg reproduces a photo (MECH16 in http://www.shroud.com/mechthild.htm) which shows the shroud lying image down, the dorsal foot end, with the image side folded back over it. The difference in colour is staggering; the whole surface of the image side appears to be deeply stained.

The sides of the patches are usually folded underneath by 1cm or so for neatness, but there are 7 instances where they have been so badly placed that they couldn’t do that without leaving too much exposed hole.

If invisible patching could be established, it would cast serious doubt on the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating. 2) The ‘bioplastic coating’ has been discredited by Rogers, who thinks it was a mistaken interpretation of some characteristics of the linen, by the radiocarbon scientists, who think it would have been removed by the cleaning procedure, and by simple observation, since there would have to be a huge amount of it to affect the date sufficiently. 3) The tensile strength measurements had nothing to do with the alleged bioplastic coating, which had been dismissed long before they were carried out. They were more to do with the gradual disintegration of linen fibres by oxidation through age. Sadly, so many other factors also contribute to the disintegration that the proportion due solely to age is rarely calculable. 4) The image may be the result of some painting or natural transfer mechanism which has since been washed off, leaving only degraded fibres behind. Rogers himself finally concluded that the fabric had indeed been ‘sized’, albeit accidentally and with no thought of image making, as part of the manufacturing process. 4) Almost any monochrome painting (or photograph) made full face, with the light from in front and a dark background, shows three dimensional attributes that are at least as good as and often better than those exhibited by the Shroud.

The great thing about the shroud is that with a little lap top software anybody can carry out a number of first hand investigations for themselves, and may discover things that nobody has noticed before, or things which seem to disagree with ‘received wisdom.’ Unlike some of the posters here, I try to show my readers where they can find my evidence, so that they can decide for themselves. To take a few of your ideas: “The dumbbell shaped marks from the flagellum.” As I cover more thoroughly in a different post (see ‘One Person’s Take Away From A Shroud Lecture’ from a few days ago), although these marks conform to a rough idea of what a flagellum (or flagrum) might be like, there is no evidence that they are at all accurate, or illustrate flogging injuries any better than dozens of medieval painters. “The Eastern “crown” of thorns covering the entire head instead of the typical circlet.” I don’t know where this idea started. Have a look at the shroud on shroudscope. The top of the head is not represented on the shroud, so it is impossible to say whether the ‘crown’ covered it or not. There are a number of ‘blood flows’ from the top of the brow, and some others around the base of the back of the skull. They could conform to any kind of spiky headgear. “The nailing thru the wrists instead of the hands.” The shroud is far from alone in showing this, and the recently deceased Dr Fred Zugibe thought that the nails may have gone in through the palms and exited at the wrists. Most statues show nails through the palms because of the danger of splitting the wood or plaster at the thinnest part of the arm. “The fact that no contemporary (middle age or Renaissance, supposedly) cultural or plastic archetypes demonstrated by the Shroud are reflected by “relics” that pilgrims could recognize.” I’m not sure what this means, but if you mean that the shroud doesn’t look like what a shroud “ought” to look like then I can only agree with you. If I were compelled to provide a ‘forgery hypothesis’ explanation for a) the fact that the shroud is long and thin instead of like a sheet and b) the fact that the shroud shows two bodies, front and back, then I would suggest that it may have been made to fit a particular space (above an altar, say) which happened to be 4m long and 1m wide. That being so, you could either have one image right in the middle (probably the back view), or both images, which would fill up the space more attractively. Convincing? no, not to me either, but it’s the sort of idea one might come up with. “One thing no one seems to ever mention is the fact that the figure of the Man of the Shroud is significantly longer in back than in front.” Another thing you can check for yourself. Superimpose two pictures, back and front, and using an ‘opacity’ slider, arrange them so that the heads and the tops of the bodies coincide. There turns out to be no great difficulty in registering the two images, except that the dorsal image includes the soles of the feet (if they were roughly at right angles to the legs the cloth could have been folded up over them), while the ventral image doesn’t. That’s why it looks longer. In this connection you might lie in bed one day with your legs bent. You will notice that whereas your ‘image’ on the bottom sheet would be shortened by bending your legs, the top sheet, conforming to the shape of your body, is about the same length as you. In other words the top image of the shroud should be longer than the bottom one, which it clearly isn’t. While pondering on this, you will also notice how little of the back of your legs actually makes contact with the sheet, and wonder how the image of the back of the legs comes to be as clearly defined as the image of the front..","date":"2013-10-08","mins":"7:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/03/and-then-too-we-have-two-comments-from-daveb-of-wellington/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"And then, too, we have two comments from Daveb of Wellington"},{"id":"comment-46718","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thank you for at least trying.

(Oh, dear, I hope I’m not turning into Colin!) Rogers did not come up with any method of dating anything. He observed that his samples from the C 14 sample contained vanillin (wholly unquantified) while samples from the rest of the shroud did not. Vanillin decays with time. He therefore claimed, quite correctly if his results were accurate, that the C 14 sample was younger than the rest of the shroud. That was all he wanted to discover, and it was all he claimed. It was not a dating method. Fanti has come up with genuine dating methods, but they are not sufficiently controlled or calibrated to be at all satisfactory in most cases. After gathering about 20 samples for testing, 30% were discarded as unsuitable anyway, although he does not say why. Firstly, he finds that if a piece of linen is left alone over time, it seems to lose structural integrity (measurable by mechanical means) in a rather roughly predictable way, resulting in a possible assessment of the age of a piece of undisturbed cloth. As the shroud has been continuously manipulated since its manufacture, whether for 1000 or 2000 years, and as Fanti’s test samples were, by selection by vacuuming, from the most degraded fibres, his graph is wholly inappropriate for dating the shroud. Fanti has also attempted two spectroscopic methods, in which I am insufficiently versed to be able to declare an opinion. I can say that, when he found that the shroud did not conform to his prejudice about its age using FT IR, he was compelled to adjust its age to account for the effects of the 1532 fire, a case of special pleading if ever I saw one. Fanti is quoted as saying that four different independent methods reached the same result. This is wholly untrue. Rogers, as I said above, reached no result at all. Fanti’s mechanical result was 400 AD, his FTIR result was 750 BC (before adjustment), and his Raman result 200 BC.

In the case of the Shroud the sample was dated three times, and compared to three known samples, and no outlier was identified. Furthermore, various different pretreatments were given the Shroud samples, to dispel a suggestion that if they were all treated exactly the same, then they were all equally likely to miss a contaminent.

Presumably the second attempt at Woods Hole used a bigger sample. Without knowing the provenance of the papyrus, the amount tested, or the procedure carried out by Gregory Hodgins, I wouldn’t place a probability on any particular reason for the anomalous dates, but reasonable scenarios can be suggested. One that comes to mind is the possibility of dissolved limestone in the water in which the papyrus grew, or was manufactured. The carbon atoms in limestone can be millions of years old, and contain no C14 at all.

Is this the De Charnay hypothesis? Credit where it’s due; it’s not mine, it’s Colin’s. But I will reply to your specific points, if you like. I, Colin and Thibault Heimburger have spent a lot of time on the scorch hypothesis and there is more to do. At the moment I’ve gone off it, but may be reconverted after further experiment! 1) I don’t think anyone suggests trying to ‘paint’ the Shroud with a hot iron! It would be a very clumsy way of doing things, almost certainly burn holes right through, and, as you say, flatten the weave noticeably (although who’s to say it might not have recovered since then?) 2) Both Colin and I have demonstrated that a very good 3 D effect can be achieved using an appropriate model with which to make contact with the cloth. Although intensity drops off very sharply when contact is lost, considerable variation in intensity can be achieved by variation in pressure. A hot brass face pressed downwards onto a cloth supported by a soft pad gives darker scorches where the nose is in contact than where the cheeks are, for example. The scorching experiments by the STURP team did not address this because they were not designed to. As for teeth and X ray fingers, I’m sorry but I don’t see them, and don’t believe they are there. 3) Eh? I’m not sure whether bodily decomposition is relevant here. There is a hypothesis (described in http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n78part11.pdf) by Giovanni Fazio that the warmth of a dead body might have selectively stimulated chemical reaction on a pre prepared sheet, but even he does not associate it with biological decomposition. 4) The wounds on the Shroud can easily be reproduced by painting, do not necessarily reflect 1st century Roman crucifixion practices accurately, and have no 3 D information or interesting negative quality. I think you are confusing the bloodstains with the image. As for the overall hypothesis, I’m not persuaded either, but I certainly wouldn’t ignore it.

Sadly, the second, ‘Further Spectroscopic Investigations of Samples of the Shroud of Turin,’ seems only to be available in his book “The Orphaned Manuscript” which is completely unobtainable. Even more sadly, that particular chapter is not accessible via Google books. The other paper you mention, ‘Updating Recent Studies on the Shroud of Turin,’ is available, at http://www.sindone.info/ADLER.PDF, but makes slightly disappointing reading in that it refers to, but does not explain or describe, various experiments that might be relevant. Adler characterises the radiocarbon area as “in an obviously waterstained area just a few inches from a burn mark.” This is slightly disingenuous, I feel. Benford and Marino rather precisely demonstrate that the edge of the nearest waterstain passes through the ‘riserva’ part of the sample rather than the dated section, and, of course, most of the Shroud is just a few inches from a burn mark. A quick sketch of the area of the Shroud gives precious little choice of where else to take the sample from, and I often wonder where other people would have taken it from if they had found themselves in Giovanni Riggi’s place. The only actual finding described by Adler in this article is summarised by Figure 1, which shows FTIR spectra for various threads. Adler says: ‘The patterns seen in Figure 1 are all distinguishably different from one another clearly indicating differences in their chemical composition.” I’m afraid I disagree with this. The differences between the ‘image,’ ‘non image,’ and ‘radiocarbon warp’ spectra are qualitative rather than quantitative, and seem well within the limits of experimental variation. Villarreal discusses this very well in his Ohio lecture. Adler goes on to claim that “peak frequency analysis” shows that the radiocarbon and Shroud fibres are different, but without showing any data as evidence, and also mentions the “scanning electron microbrobe data that showed gross enrichment of the inorganic mineral elements in the radiocarbon samples.” I believe he may be referring to his discovery that 2% of the radiocarbon sample was aluminium, but again, he gives no data. Finally he says that “the radiocarbon sample fibres appear to be an exaggerated composite of the waterstain and scorch fibres.” I don’t even know what this means, but it seems to be contradicted by his own Figure 1 (where the radiocarbon sample is more like the non image sample than either the waterstain or the scorch), and his aluminium finding (which is not present in either the waterstain or the scorch). Of all of this it seems that it is his aluminium finding which is most quoted by those looking for support for the patch hypothesis. Alum, it seems, was a common medieval mordant for madder root dye, and fits in rather better with Rogers’s finding than his own gum arabic, which is a sticky glue which dissolves when wet. All in all, I think that the aluminium finding is relevant to my article, and agree that I should have included it. I would have if I had known about it! However, as has been commented elsewhere, there is no way in which 16th century surface contamination could be responsible for changing a 1st century date into a 13th century one. The proportions of the two must be about 60% medieval to 40% ancient to achieve the mixture, and even the dullest of observers must have noticed that amount, even with a hand lens..","date":"2014-01-24","mins":"1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"id":"comment-74465","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ooh, flattery will get you anything. Still, When I say the wounds can be reproduced by painting, I mean they are fairly easy to simulate using paint, blood or a mixture, although until what they were actually made of is established, it will be impossible to replicate their chemistry. It was their shapes I was thinking of. Much to most people’s surprise, we have very little idea of what a Roman flagrum (or flagellum) looked like. None have ever been found, and there are a few illustrations on coins and the like, all different. It was obviously some kind of thonged whip, but how many thongs or tips, and what the tips might have been made of, is anyone’s guess (see Mel Gibson’s Passion film). It may be that the marks on the shroud exactly match a Roman flagrum, or it may be that a painter just came up with a good idea. The two designs of Roman flagrum that copies have often been made of and photographed were based specifically on measurements made of the Shroud itself, and do not even resemble the ancient illustrations. Much to most people’s surprise, we have no idea whether people were nailed through the palms, hands or lower arms. Although elaborate demonstrations with real corpses have shown how a hanging body would be too heavy for a dead weight on the arms, many Roman descriptions mention a sedile or seat, sometimes described as a horn sticking out, on which the victim sat, removing all the weight from his arms altogether. It may be that the nails through the wrists thing exactly match a Roman crucifixion, or it may be that a painter just thought it might be a good idea (perhaps he experimented on corpses too!). Much to people’s surprise, blood does not trickle down the outside of hair. It oozes out from the scalp and mats it into a bloody mass. Google news pictures of terrorists bombs for confirmation. To be fair, some people have supposed that the blood flows down the side of the face were imprinted on the shroud from the cheeks, whereafter the shroud realigned itself horizontally to receive the image of the hair, which was thus out of register with the blood flows. However this does not account for the trickles which appear at the back of the head. Much to people’s surprise, blood does not zigzag out of a stab wound to the chest, it flows straight down. To be fair, some people have surmised that the bloodflow from the chest occurred after the body had been taken down from the cross and the original blood had been washed off, and stained the cloth as the body was wrapped or draped with it. This is quite a reasonable scenario. You mentioned earlier that the wounds could not be “drawn in by any genius artist to match in 3 D information and negative quality.” All the blood flows are now fairly uniform pinkish stains, and do not display any particularly interesting features in terms of any relationship between their colour intensity and distance, which is the basis of the 3 D effect, or in terms of their negativity (they just turn green).

Firstly, although I am certain that what I have previously described as “gunk” (i.e. Surface contamination including any wandering cotton fibres, wax, silk, oils, paint and any other debris) would have been removed by the cleaning process, I cannot be sure that a fast dye would be. I have some madder root soaked linen drying in my laboratory as I speak, mordanted with alum. I shall give it a week to dry, then wash it with acids and alkalis as described in the Nature paper to see if it all disappears or not. Watch this space! However, even if I didn’t wash it all away, its tiny mass compared to that of the cloth itself would mean that its effect on the carbon content of the shroud would be trivial and quite possibly not measurable within the experimental accuracy of the dating process. Another idea might be simply to increase the number of C14 atoms within the molecular structure of the linen itself. This is difficult to do just by burying the sample in charcoal, (you could shake it off) but was thought to be possible if carbon atoms from, say, the gas carbon monoxide were to diffuse into the cloth, either reacting with it or simply exchanging carbon atoms by some atomic diffusion process. Good plan, and it was tried out, but didn’t work. See “https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/embed.php?File=shroud.html” for Chrstopher Ramsay’s explanation. What’s more, it was predicted not to work as no such effect has been observed on any other artifact. Nevertheless, one experiment does not constitute a definitive rebuttal, and there is a (pretty faint) possibility that the circumstances uniquely surrounding the Shroud could have led to a C14 enrichment. Ray Roger’s, for example, thought that the thymol with which the Shroud has recently been treated as an antibiotic might interact with the linen (making subsequent radiocarbon dating impossible), and if something similar to that had happened in the past, then it might have distorted the date appropriately. Thymol itself has not been observed to have any effect on radiocarbon dating, as it happens, so all is not lost from a new sampling point of view. Fire is unlikely to have had any effect. For a start many archaeological radiocarbon dates have been satisfactorily established using charcoal from cooking fires, and secondly part of the dating process involves the complete combustion of the sample under test..","date":"2014-01-24","mins":"4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"id":"comment-74449","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Intervening posts have appeared while I was writing the above!

The details are in ‘AMS Radiocarbon Dating of Medieval Textile Relics: the Frocks and the Pillow of St Francis of Assisi,’ M. Fedi et al, Science Direct, 2009. (Behind a paywall, I’m afraid). Beginning with “dating of materials connected to faith is always a delicate matter,” which has a famiiar ring to it, the authors discuss where, exactly, they took their radiocarbon samples from. “Samples were taken following the advice of a textile conservator, who examined the manufacture of the relics. No darns or patches were present.” Sounds familiar? “Anyway, [interesting adverb…] we decided to sample several pieces from each frock.” From one ‘frock,’ “supposed to have covered St Francis just in the moment of his death,” the team took seven samples, about 1cm2 each, three from the hem, two from the end of one of the short sleeves, one from the side, and one from slap in the middle of the back. The frock was made of several pieces of wool sewn together, and the samples came from different pieces. The samples were washed in an ultrasound bath, then in hydrochloric acid, but not in sodium hydroxide as it was thought detrimental to wool. One of the hem samples and the one from the side fell to pieces during cleaning and couldn’t be used. The others gave dates of between 1155 and 1225, a 70 year spread which was assumed consistent. This compares with the Shroud findings (12 samples from the same place) of between about 1225 and 1315, a 90 year spread. St Francis died in 1226, which fitted this frock (and the pillow, as it happens) well. The other frock was dated to about 1300, and was therefore considered not a genuine relic, although the authors say, rather charmingly, that “these data are not to be read in a negative way, since the result of its dating can anyway be a valuable element for the reconstruction of the history of religion during Middle Ages.” The circumstances of the two radiocarbon datings make interesting comparison, I feel. One important point is that, even in 2005, a 1cm2 area is considered a minimum sample for accurate dating, whereas in 1988 every laboratory subdivided its sample further and tested each one separately. No wonder their experimental error bars were so much bigger, especially those of Tucson, which dated roughly 0.2cm2 pieces..","date":"2014-01-25","mins":"6:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"id":"comment-74666","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The vanillin/lignin discrepancy is a definite piece of evidence suggesting a medieval (or later) provenance to some aspects of the Shroud.

Nor is their any suggestion in the BSTS article to which you refer that the cotton fibres identified by the Oxford team were integral to any linen threads. By all means take Rogers, Benford and Marino, Villarreal and Brown at their word. They are, or were, people whose integrity I do not doubt for a moment.

I also have the utmost respect for, and have corresponded with, Riani, Atkinson, Ramsay and Professor Timothy Jull, whose peer reviewed paper in the world’s most respected journal of carbon 14 dating John Kotz described as “silly.” I am certain that Joe Marino finds my contrary opinions irritating (so would I if it was the other way round!) but I have the greatest respect for his hypothesis, which would certainly be the biggest counter to the accuracy of the carbon dating if only it could be established clearly and consistently that the threads that were carbondated were indeed a medieval interpolation. That this it has not been established, and why I think so, I hope I have made clear. Can I show that Rogers did not take samples of whole threads from the main body of the shroud? He never mentions doing so. A few threads had been extracted, and were so few that they were given names. I only know of the “Zina thread” and the “Tamar Thread,” although that seems to have been of dubious provenance.

I won’t go through it in detail, but it does not refute any of my previous arguments. Some of it is transparently wrong as can be confirmed by anybody with an i Pad or a few of the 1978 STURP papers. The very opening sentence, for example: “The herringbone weave, that is so consistent throughout the main body of the shroud…” This is nonsense. The herringbone weave is irregular, in some places extremely so, and the thickness of both warp and weft threads varies irregularly throughout the shroud, the thickest threads being up to 5 times thicker than the thinnest. Surely I cannot be the only person in the world who has actually seen French reweaving. It is extremely clever and painstaking work, but pefectly visible under a microscope where the new threads lie alongside the old. It is very well illustrated by the top photos at http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/forum/showthread.php?120259 My first go at reweaving. In this repair, three or four white threads, perhaps 10 to 20 mm long, have been threaded alongside broken verticals, joining up a break of a few millimetres. It looks as if horizontal blue threads have been added too, but they are less clear. In the video Sue Benford describes the threads as having been twisted together, which would be even more obvious. I have searched hard for this kind of evidence (how I would love to find it!) on Shroud 2.0 without success. Has anybody else whose blind faith in everything that confirms their prejudices and blind rejection of everything that doesn’t even looked? I thought not.

Further on in the video Ray Rogers, in voiceover, describes looking at the ultraviolet photos of the shroud.

The six quad mosaic images are at https://www.shroud.com/gallery/index.htm, close to the bottom. Two of them are enlargements of others. Three of the remaining four show exactly the same colouration: namely a pale blue upper, bright yellow middle and orange base, with green lower left hand corners. The fourth has a blue central smudge which does not extend as far as the other three. In his article “Some Details about the STURP Quad Mosaic Images” (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf) Barrie Schwortz quotes Jean Lorre, as follows: “There was a strong illumination brightness falloff from the centre. This was eliminated by dividing each image by a flat field.” Well it wasn’t, was it? Each of the images is brighter in the centre than it is around the edges. The flat field process may have diminished the brightness falloff, but it didn’t eliminate it, and that’s important. What Lorre is clearly explaining is what was hoped, or expected, not what actually happened. Let’s go on. “We wanted to enhance the colour to reveal subtle colours which might betray spatial variations in chemical composition. […] we greatly exaggerated the colour saturations while preserving the original hues and intensities.” A noble idea, but it didn’t work. Lorre wishes so much that it had, that he loses all touch with his own images in his next sentence. “These colour images should be interpreted as a chemical composition map.” Shall we take him at his word? Shall we agree that the blue bands across the top of three of the quad images really represent different chemicals from the yellow and orange below them? What might these blue bands be? They may be found across the front of the thighs, the head, and the buttocks. Shall we? Or shall we agree that the illumination of the areas of the shroud by the photographic lights are responsible, and the colours have nothing to do with the chemical composition of the shroud at all. Oh, and the image described as “ultraviolet” by Rogers? It’s the shape of the patches which gives it away. It’s the one captioned Quad Mosaic Dorsal Legs, which shows the bloodstained feet at the top, and nearly reaches the buttocks at the bottom.

You can clearly see the bloodstains of the feet at the top of the photo. “Here is this area that is significantly darker – it doesn’t fluoresce as much…” The camera is panning down and across to the bottom left hand corner of the quad mosaic picture of the Dorsal Legs. “It’s just this area around the Raes sample and where the radiocarbon sample was cut.” We have reached a close up on the lower left hand area of deep green, and then cut back to Rogers. Yes there is a green patch over the lower left hand corner of the ventral lower legs (where it appears over the radiocarbon corner), but there is also a green patch on the lower left hand corner of the dorsal lower legs (where it appears just to left of the upper thigh), and a green patch on the lower left hand corner of the ventral torso (where it appears level with the groin) , and a green patch on the lower left hand corner of the dorsal torso (where it appears next to the back of the head). In fact every quad photo has a green patch in its lower left hand corner. The green patch is not abnormal. The green patch appears in the same place on every photo. So does the blue patch. So does the rest of the colouring. The green patch is not peculiar to the radiocarbon corner. It is an artifact of the photographic lighting.

My first comment above was to anoxie. As for the LANL findings, I thoroughly recommend Robert Villarreal’s lecture about them on You Tube, where you will find he is much more uncertain about them than might be expected. He does not find the images at all unequivocal. As to Benford and Marino. Both their Ohio presentation (http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p09.pdf), and their Chemistry Today paper (http://shroud.com/pdfs/benfordmarino2008.pdf) begin with the Quad Mosaic evidence, as if they considered that the most significant. I agree that their 2000 didn’t even mention it though, so you’re probably correct about the chronology. It’s perfectly true that there are no clear photos of the weaving discrepancies observed by the various expert tailors. The same poor quality photo is reproduced in their 2000 and their 2008 papers. It would be good if Joe could confirm or deny that that was the photo used. Now, of course, one would use Shroud 2.0, as I did. By doing so, I believe I have a much better idea of the inconsistency of the thickness of the threads of the shrouds than the tailors consulted. And I can see the same inconsistency all over the shroud, not just in one tiny place. And forgive me for using the term tailor instead of textile experts. I mean no disrespect; certainly not. However, to me a textile expert is a university academic, while a tailor is a practitioner. Joe makes very clear that his experts are tailors, but not that they are academics. I have no doubt that they can be just as knowledgable however, and do not automatically therefore elevate Mechtilde Flury Lemberg’s opinions above theirs. And yes, I agree. I’m a scientist. Sitting on the fence is what we do best… Can anything be wrong with the impeccable C14 tests? Well yes. The Riani and Atkinson paper is very persuasive, and I find it very odd that nobody from the radiocarbon dating cares to defend themselves against the very serious accusations of incompetence and fraud which have been levelled against them. However the idea that water soluble contaminents are likely to have affected the procedure I think is weak, and the oft quoted but vague assertion that radiocarbon dating is often wrong is weaker still.

The ‘missing corner’ section is brown, but the area which had been covered by the Raes sample is white. Something similar is apparent in Barrie Schwortz’s transmitted light photos too. Seeing as this photo cannot be easily reconciled with Miller and Pellicori’s UV setup and photos in their Biological Photography paper, I surmise that this photo is a visible light photo – albeit somewhat modified. Disappointingly, I cannot find a picture of the radiocarbon corner, including the backing cloth, taken after the sample was cut, but before the Holland cloth was replaced. Can anyone help? Because I predict (dangerous), that the area that had been concealed under the radiocarbon sample area will be as white as the area that had been under the Raes sample area. How to explain this? Was something smeared over that corner, and, for that matter, the burn holes as well, after the shroud had been stitched to the Holland cloth, to try to make the colours more uniform? Did it include a mixture of madder root dye and gum arabic? And was it applied with a cotton pad? Are shreds of cotton, dyed with madder and glued down with gum arabic, found along the edges of the shroud adjacent to the Holland cloth – including the edges of the burn holes? It’s new, it’s revolutionary, and you read it here first, folks! Now, anoxie. 1) I don’t think it has been satisfactorily demonstrated that cotton fibres are anywhere an integral part of the spinning of any of the thread in the the shroud, or of the weaving of the cloth. 2) As the amount of cotton per thread varies, according to observer, from 2% to 100% in the radiocarbon area, I have no difficulty in supposing that fibres in different proportions can be found anywhere on the shroud. 3) Had the cotton been an integral part of the threads being tested, the cleaning process would not have removed it.

Did a very good job of demonstrating that. Progressive contamination of the sample strip seems to me well established. What they did not demonstrate was that the contamination had made a 1st century piece cloth appear to be 13th century. As for the Rossman dating, it appears to be extremely suspect. Apart from Caltech’s own formal denial that Rossman had ever had any dealings with the shroud, or that he had any experience or expertise in dating, or that he had access to FTMS anyway (http://www.shroud.com/late02.htm), it should be noted that FTMS is a hopelessly inadequate method of attempting to quantify a proportion of C14 to C12 atoms, as is even admitted in Benford and Marino’s Textile Evidence paper (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/textevid.pdf). Adler, from whom this information was obtained, claimed that Rossman was “the world’s expert in it [dating], and there’s no arguing with him.” That statement was palpably untrue. Some mention has been made of the ‘fact’ that the different ends of the alleged spliced thread have different twists. This is not obvious from Rogers’s photo, and in fact proves that the splice does not exist, as splicing is only possible if the twists are the same, otherwise the splice would simply unravel as it was being made. (Don’t take my word for it – try it out!) Finally, Max says that Hall, Testore and Villarreal also all thought they could see spliced threads. I don’t believe they did, and I don’t believe they said they did. Can Max give us any reference to their findings to substantiate his claim? Villarreal, in particular, looked at threads he was given by Rogers, Benford and Marino and decided that the two ends were the same material (cotton) and that they hadn’t been spliced but glued together. On the basis of the three cotton threads he was given, he felt that the corner piece was not typical of the rest of the shroud (which appears to be pure linen), but as he wasn’t given a representative sample, he could hardly determine how unrepresentative it was.

However… The picture of the “broken splice,” is not a splice. Not in any way I interpret the term splice anyway. The ‘broken’ end is far too tight to be part of a thread that has been joined together by some sort of interweaving of unravelled fibres. It looks more as if the two ends were simply butted together and glued with that “crust” which, surprisingly, is wholly invisible on the picture of the intact thread, and which, in spite of being a completely different colour, Rogers missed. Whichever it is, however, there is no known method of invisible repair which uses such a splice/join as a way of adding its repair material, and it is difficult to envision any reason why anybody should want to. I understand your point about the discrepancy between the FTIR findings (cotton), and your observations (linen mixed with cotton), but am not convinced that all or even most of the Raes and/or C14 sample was made of these interpolated fibres, of whatever material.

I should be very grateful if you would break this sentence into shorter segments: “Le poids unitaire du Linceul étant estimé à 0,023 g/cm2 ± 10%, au sein de l’échantillon parent C14 pesant 158,5 mg ± 0,3mg, il suffirait au pire d’un remplacement soit d’à peine 106 millièmes de gramme ± 10% de fibres textiles originelles du Ier siècle par une quantité égale de fibres beaucoup plus récentes issues de réparations invisibles effectuées entre 1858 et 1988 (estimation haute selon Jackson), soit de seulement 79 millièmes de gramme ± 10% (estimation basse selon Évin) pour que la relique présumée de « 1260 1390 » soit définitivement enlevée au Moyen Age et se retrouve placée à l’époque coloniale romaine.” As it stands, the best paraphrase I can manage is : “If the original C14 sample weighed 158.5mg, it would only need 106mg of the 1st century to be replaced by the same mass of recent material (for the date to appear medieval). If only 79mg was replaced, then the date would appear colonial Roman.” This concurs rather loosely with what I wrote above. However, it might be useful to our readers to explain exactly how we arrived at these values. I use the Carbon Dating Calculator at http://dwb4.unl.edu/Chem/CHEM869 Z/CHEM869 Z Links/www.all.mq.edu.au/online/edu/egypt/carbdate.htm. A) Entering 700 (years ago) into the calculator tells us that 91.881% of the original C14 will remain in an artefact that old. B) Entering 2000 (years ago) into the calculator tells us that 78.511% of the original C14 will remain in an artefact that old. C) Entering 0 (years ago) into the calculator tells us (unsurprisingly) that 100% of the original C14 will remain in an artefact that old. The problem is to calculate how much of Sample (c) must be mixed with Sample (b) to produce a result similar to Sample (a).

Now let’s see. “A KGB agent hacked into the AMS system control console computer at each of the three C 14 labs and inserted a program which … would yield years clustering around AD 1325, just before the Shroud’s appearance in undisputed history in the 1350s.” Response: I consider that any agency capable of doing that was capable of hacking into a great many far more important things than an archaeological dating, and probably extending the cold war far into the 21st century. I think the writing of the ‘fake’ program and its physical replacement in the AMS calculating machine would require a detailed knowledge of the system, and could not be done by somebody popping in one evening. I think the likelihood of this happening three times is, to use a well worn expression “overwhelmingly” improbable. “You fail to consider what a perceived threat it would be to the Soviet Union if the Shroud was dated to the first or early centuries.” I don’t believe the dating of the Shroud was anything but trivial to the Soviet Union. Not only did the announcement of the 14th century date have absolutely no effect on the Catholic or any other Christian Church, if it did anything to the Soviet Union it simply accelerated its downfall, which occurred very soon afterwards. “You denigrate me personally by calling my proposal a “conspiracy theory” with all its negative connotations.” A plot by the KGB to subvert workers in three different laboratories in three different countries so that they wrote, taped and replaced a minor calculation program in an archaeological laboratory to attempt to discredit Christianity by misdating one of its relics, without any evidence for such a plot whatever, is a conspiracy theory by any standards. Such theories often have negative connotations because, as there is no evidence for them, the evidence cannot be examined or disproved. A conspiracy theory for which there is some evidence has no negative connotations. “My bottom line is that, since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud to convert a 1st century actual date of the Shroud into the too good to be true 1325 ± 65 years date.” Quite. That there is no room for doubt in Stephen’s mind that the shroud is authentic is fair enough, but to claim that a logical consequence of the shroud’s authenticity is that there HAD to be some sort of fraud, is simply non sense. “My proposal that the labs were duped by a computer hacker fits all the facts.” No, it doesn’t. The facts, about the staff at the laboratories, the nature of the calculator program, the plans of the KGB, how the KGB communicated to its agents, the means of replacing the old program with the new and how such a replacement went undetected have not been considered or presented. Your proposal is not contradicted by the very few facts to hand, which is a very different thing. Such facts as have been discovered, by people who have tried to examine the facts supporting your theories rather more than you have yourself, have wholly discredited the ‘single computer hacker’ theory. “Yes, slogans like “conspiracy theory” are excuses not to think about the problem.” How I wish that were true. Unlike, I suspect, its author, I have thought about it in detail since it was proposed. I wrote to the laboratories involved for evidence, I considered the effect the successful execution of this theory actually had on Christianity and on the Soviet Union. Did he? “I made NO ‘Satanic allegations about Pope Francis’. All I wrote … was: “But if the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!” This is disingenuous. The rest of your quote is: “But if the Shroud is authentic (as the evidence is overwhelming that it is), then Jesus whose image would then be on the Shroud, who commanded His followers: ‘Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.” (Mt 5:37) would presumably not be pleased with the Roman Catholic Church’s duplicitous official position on His burial shroud.” As the church refuses to say ‘Yes’ or ‘No,’ then your own quotation declares the church’s attitude to ‘come from evil.’ “And even if my proposal that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker turns out to be wrong, that does not make my other ‘convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud … utterly worthless.’” Sadly, it does. And I agree that that’s very unfair. But that’s the trouble with extremism. However, toning things down a little may help to re establish credibility. “I am PERSUADED BY THE EVIDENCE that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Jesus Christ and bears His crucified and resurrected image.” That’s a very good start. “Since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud.” That’s extremism. “I note that no one has responded to the points I made above, but instead they have repeated ad hominems and/or changed the subject.” Well I hope that’s all sorted out now.

However… (Didn’t you just know there would be a ‘however’?) This paper begins with the information that the research therein would be based on a UV F photograph taken by Vernon Miller in 1978, which can be found at Shroud Science Group website. The photograph, unchanged, is reproduced in the paper as Figure 1. It is in varying shades of brown, with a very bright area from the backing cloth where the Raes sample was cut. Now I have Miller and Pellicori’s 1981 paper published in the journal of Biological Photography, which includes a detailed description of the set up for the UV photographs, and six well reproduced photographs. Neither the set up nor the photographs are at all consistent with the photograph which claims to be one of their photographs in Morgan’s paper. Their photographs are grey blue rather than brown, and do not extend to the edges of the shroud. They exclude the radiocarbon corner altogether. In view of these comments I dispute that the photograph analysed by Morgan is a UV F photograph at all. Can you clarify that? The paper goes on to increasingly elaborate methods to demonstrate that the colour of the radiocarbon area is different from the rest of the shroud, but does not even mention, let alone discuss, that that the area around the burn holes is exactly the same colour. It is a major argument against Morgan’s hypothesis that difference in colour represents difference in chemical composition, but he doesn’t even notice it. By far the biggest anomaly in the picture is the difference between the adjacent areas of Holland cloth, the area of the ‘missing corner’ and the area which once backed the Raes sample. If difference in colour represents difference in chemical composition, this is extremely significant.

Challenged, I grant you, and quite respectably, but without a little more information about where Rogers got his evidence about “other medieval linen” and “other very old linens” it can hardly be said to be seriously threatened. Vanillin has been extracted from coal, so is not necessarily destroyed by age. It may be that it was present on the 1988 samples, but not detected, or is only present as a contaminent on the Raes and radiocarbon sample. Until this is resolved, the coffin not only stays open, but empty as well. And as for peer reviewing, I agree it was a pity people with such an axe to grind were appointed reviewers of Sue and Joe’s paper; but I wonder if Radiocarbon had much choice. I’ve no doubt the same sort of thing happens in all sorts of fringe scientific inquiries; there are only a few people qualified to comment on any submitted paper, and all of them have their own interests chiefly at heart.

I wonder why Thibault chose to invert the UV picture. You see the serum, which is supposedly invisible by ordinary light, is supposedly fluorescent, so becomes visible by UV light. Making the UV picture negative means that the serum becomes darker, not lighter, so that by all the criteria used to judge the serum I have yet read, Thibaut’s scratchmarks are definitely not serum stains. To be fair to Thibault, he does not claim (unlike yourself, above) that they are. All the white scratchmarks on his negative are clearly visible as non fluorescent (and therefore non serum) dark marks on the positive of the UV photo. The marks are less visible in ordinary light because blood inhibits fluorescence, increasing the contrast in a UV photo, but all Thibault’s marks are present on Durante’s photo. They are not easy to identify in Thibault’s paper because of the different scales of the two images, but they’re there if you look. And Mike, try reading the ‘experts’ such as Bucklin, Barbet and Zugibe carefully. They were surgeons, treating the Shroud as a photograph of a dead body. They had no experience of forgery, and were not in a position to decide whether a forger could recreate the wounds or not. Well aware of this, neither Bucklin nor Zugibe commented on whether such a reproduction was possible or not. Barbet thought it impossible, and said so, but Zugibe, in particular, was almost contemptuous of Barbet’s incompetence in a way that even some of his adherents think was extreme.

And again, a misunderstanding of statistics. Stephen quotes very selectively from an article by Jacques Evin, saying that it would not be possible to date the Shroud “closer than a span of 200 years.” What a pity he did not quote a bit more: “as to the outside limits of the span there can be absolutely no mistake.” And more specifically: “But remember, this interval signifies above all that the exact date of the Shroud could not fall outside the two precsie dates which limit the interval.” In other words, he is referring to a certainly of well over the 95% confidence level reported in the Nature paper. In terms of the standard deviation from the mean, he could be referring to three (99.73% confidence) or even four (99.99%), which in no way contradicts the conclusion of the Nature paper. Stephen goes on to say that the discrepancy between Oxford’s and Arizona’s average dates is inexplicable by normal AMS procedure, but is consistent with his theory that the dates were randomly generated (to cluster around 1325) in all three laboratories. Well no. If the dates were all randomly generated then they would cluster more evenly around the average than they do. It was precisely the non random distribution of the dates that alerted Remi van Haelst and later Riani & Atkinson to attempt an explanation. Stephen is fascinated by the astonishing accuracy of the Arizona date about 1350, and claims that because the scientists were all nuclear physicists they probably didn’t realise how difficult it is to harvest flax and make it into a sheet in only five years. Eh? Is it? And didn’t they? As it happens he’s wrong about that too as the Arizona BP dates convert to about 1340 AD not 1350. But anyway, what happened to the Oxford super spy? Did they all have to write their own programs, and did he get his wrong, because the Oxford dates cluster around 1250, which is surely way too early.

If the details I thought we needed experts to point out are easily available, then please let us know which of the two eminent pathologists, Barbet or Zugibe was wrong. Does a nail through the wrist damage the median nerve or not? I don’t know if Bucklin thought the image could be replicated by an artist or not. The words ‘art,’ ‘paint,’ ‘forge’ and all their derivatives do not occur at all in his ‘An Autopsy on the Man of the Shroud.’ Did he ever deny that the shroud could be a forgery? Did Zugibe? If I can take you back to your first comments (back to Square 1, that’s me): a) “Some of the scourge marks (type 3 in Faccini’s paper) have no blood, only serum.” Your evidence for this was Thibault’s paper, which quite clearly shows the opposite. B) “I’d rather follow the expert advice of [Drs Bucklin, Zugibe and Barbet]” But Dr Zugibe and Dr Barbet offer entirely contradictory observations. You cannot follow the expert advice of them both. C) From Barbet: “to describe these imprints as the work of a forger is an attitude which is absurd.” This comment was not repeated by either Bucklin nor Zugibe. D) “I like to respect expert opinion when it’s beyond my scope of practice.” and “Barbet, Zugibe and Buckiln may have differed on some details as do all experts in any field. But they all agreed that this was a crucified man.” The thing they agree on is not at all beyond the scope of anyone’s practice. What is beyond our scope of practice is something they did not all agree to. E) “Art work can easily be pointed out due to the style of the artist.” This may or may not be true, but neither Bucklin nor Zugibe did, in fact, point it out. F) “The shroud looks like a crime scene picture.” It does, doesn’t it, and the only time I have seen similar realistic ‘crime scene pictures’ have been in modern reconstructions of the passion on film. I am fortunate that the nearest I can get to ‘the real thing’ are the scourging and crucifixions regularly carried out every Easter in Mexico and the Philippines, which bear no resemblance to the Shroud at all, in that the scourging seems to produce far more blood than we find on the shroud, and the crucifixion much less. The other details you mention are again, oft quoted but little justified. The ring of bloodstains around the back of the head does not justify a cap of thorns. There is little or no blood between them and the rivulets at the front of the head, perhaps because the Shroud was not in contact with the body there (there is a distinct image gap) or perhaps because the top of the head was not, in fact bleeding at all. Anyway the ringlet of bloodstains looks more as if it was applied on the outer surface of the hair rather than having to seep through from inside. The bloodflow down the arms looks as if it is realistic but probably isn’t, in terms both of the quantity of blood available and the angle of flow as has been interestingly demonstrated by Borrini and Garlaschelli quite recently. There is evidence. There is lots of evidence in favour of a real crucified man leaving his blood and an image on a cloth. But none of it is indisputable, none of it is conclusive and much of it is directly contradictory. That’s fine by me; it is what makes the shroud such a fascinating object.

Earlier on this site Barrie said that he did not think any UV photos were taken other than from the elaborate set up Miller and Pellicori devised for the taking of them, from which Morgan’s photo clearly deviates. I very much look forward to clarification. In the event of my being wrong, then we’re back to the inescapable conclusion that the high correlation between fluorescence and age strongly suggests that the date was produced by contamination that fluoresced, such that the more the contamination, the older the date. However Paolo di Lazzaro makes a valid point that any of these photos may only illuminate surface discrepancies, independent of any deeper interpolation, so that while on the surface it appears that the more the contamination the older the Shroud (to 99.93% reliability), underneath it may be that the more the interweaving the younger the Shroud.

That’s such a high correlation it strongly suggests that the date was produced by contamination that fluoresced.” All I did was point out an incontestably logical corollary to this statement, and look what happened. It was not my claim, it was an thoroughly mainstream authenticist one. And suddenly it was all wrong. The correlation did not suggest that the date was produced by contamination at all. There was no such correlation, the correlation was fortuitous, the fluorescence did not demonstrate contamination, the contamination was superficial, the date had nothing to do with the contamination, Morgan was wrong and Schneider was ‘meaningless.’ How curious that none of this was noticed earlier, but only when a comfortable support to the ‘new material incorporation’ hypothesis suddenly turned out to be no such thing. If anything has been debunked, it is not a ‘misleading skeptic claim’ but a misleading authenticist blunder. Well, never mind. I don’t believe Morgan’s photo was a UV one anyway.

The bottom line is that in order to achieve a radiocarbon date of 1350 you either have to have material of 1350, or a blend of materials that together give 1350 (barring exotics like nuclear bombardment). If you stipulate that some of that material must be 1st century, then the proportion of material from after 1350 can be easily calculated, and comes to about two thirds. As I understand it most authenticists accept that this cannot be achieved by Rogers’s gums and dyes, or any kind of cotton fibre contamination floating in from above, but must imply a substantial replacement of the linen threads by new threads. The suggestion is that the new threads were also linen, but can be distinguished from the older ones by a) their vanillin content, b) their cotton intermixture content, and c) their coating of dye. This last has now been discounted as a factor in C14 dating. The problem authenticists have now is to demonstrate how these new threads can be totally invisible to the naked eye, when every thread can be fairly easily followed across various photographs from one side to the other. Invisible mending is obvious under these magnifications, as the new threads lie alongside the old threads for some distance in order for them to have any grip, and there is no sign of it. So we are left with the bizarre “splice” hypothesis, in which old threads and new are unravelled and twisted together (and maybe glued in place), so that when the threads are rewoven there really are no overlapping ends. I say bizarre because this is postulated to have occurred over a length of only a few millimetres, in order to produce a thread which is only a few millimetres longer. The only observed instance of it was by Robert Villarreal, whose thread of only a few millimetres fell apart neatly into two pieces which weren’t ‘spliced’ at all, but simply glued together..","date":"2015-03-24","mins":"3:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"},{"id":"comment-194187","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’ll do my best, Thibault, but it might have to wait till tomorrow….","date":"2015-03-23","mins":"5:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"},{"id":"comment-194266","author":"hugh_farey","post":"“The skeptics who seem to ignore the findings of Rogers, Villarreal and the photographs of John Brown.” Seem to ignore?

From Ox Cal I find that 1350 AD (the radiocarbon date) is equivalent to about 600 BP. From the C14 calculator I find that 600 BP is equivalent to about 93.0% C14. Now all we need to do is to find out what proportions of the first two produce a percentage of C14 of 93.0%, thus appearing to be from 1350 AD. We find that 22% of old cloth and 78% of newer cloth produce this result. The calculation is (22/100 x 79.0) + (78/100 x 97.0) = 93.04. I hope that’s clear.

That’s such a high correlation it strongly suggests that the date was produced by contamination that fluoresced.” Now he seems to be denying that the correlation means anything at all. Now he says: “No conclusion can be drawn from the C14 data with any reliability” and “I think all the data shows the sample to be totally anomalous based on objective data.” Why has he changed his mind? From a 99.9% correlation to no correlation at all. From a “strong” suggestion that “the date was produced by contamination that fluoresced” to no such suggestion at all. And why does he think that “it’s rather funny to then try to spin that into a narrative that the shroud is even younger than it dated. Whatever that is, it isn’t science.” Really?

No “spin.” No “narrative.” And that is Science. And I’m afraid I disagree with the new conclusion too.

The two main foundations for my cogitations on the date of the Shroud and in particular the C14 corner are the famous ‘Nature’ paper and Riani & Atkinson’s statistical analysis which appears to demonstrate a chronological gradient across the shroud sample. There is thus room for some variation across the C14 area, which could be caused by the addition of an extraneous substance. To adjust the date from 1st to 13th century requires that most of the C14 sample was from the last few centuries, for which there is no visible evidence even under very high magnification, and very incoherent microscopic evidence. However to establish a chronological gradient over a hundred years or so requires rather less contamination. Any paint, bioplastic coating, surface layer or water soluble contamination (Rogers’s gum) would be removed by the ultrasound, detergent, acic base acid cleaning procedure, but I think perhaps Rogers’s dye discovery, adhering rather more integrally to the material, and smeared irregularly across the sample area, could provide the contamination I’m looking for. As I currently reject the reweave idea, I was looking for another reason for a dye being applied to the area when I read comments about the 2002 restoration, where the brightness of the new backing is widely criticised for not fitting the colour of the shroud well enough.

The testimony of anybody is not invalid by personal desire; it is invalid if it is unsubstantiated. Family tradition is not worthless, but it does not constitute fact. “Hugh, are you suggesting “your expertise” and alleged “photographic evidence of the contrary” is more reliable than theirs.” Yes, I am. However expert the examiners, neither the extent nor the quality of the photo they were given was adequate for a reliable judgement. I’d bet my house (the one I won’t need after winning daveb’s!) that if the same textile companies were given Shroud 2.0 to look at, they would find no more or less evidence of interpolation at the sample corner than anywhere else on the cloth. Your last quotation is excellent and one I continually live by. However, a fact is not determined by personal conviction but by evidence. I’m not persuaded by your evidence, so for me, I do not believe the interweaving is a fact. Oh, and I missed your enquiry about the red rag to a bull.

The Holland cloth appears fairly uniformly discoloured where it is exposed, and there is a sharp cut off between the exposed and the unexposed areas. I would expect sweat stains to be less uniform. Light, on the other hand, I would expect to bleach the cloth paler, not darker, unless there was a high proportion of lignin in it (like old newspapers). You may remember, however, that I first speculated about this possible dying of the Holland cloth with reference to the high contrast Enrie photos, which seem to show darker areas on the Shroud around the margins of those parts adjoining the Holland cloth. 8:59 A repeat of the above. 9:04 See my answer above. 9:10 Yes, I’m as English as it’s possible to be. 9:18 It is indeed my humble opinion, supported only by the evidence I display before you. Scienctists aren’t keen on ‘conclusive scientific facts.’ Non scientists, on the other hand, often use the term, often as a synonym for ‘guesses.’ 9:27 “Re ‘threadbareness’, Hugh what you make of (sharp) fingernail pressure per cm2? NOTHING.” You’re quite correct there. I do not consider ‘sharp fingernail pressure’ an avenue worth pursuing. 9:39 I’m certainly not 100% sure there was no repair and no reweaving at all in the C14 sample. However the weave of the shroud can be studied in some detail on Shroud 2.0, the X ray photos from 1978, and on detailed photos of one of the radiocarbon pieces retained by the Tucson laboratory. No interweaving is detectable, and the continuousness of many of the threads deeply into the body of the Shroud can easily be observed. After examining all the evidence, for and against, I am of the opinion that there is insufficent evidence for a 60% modern intervention to be sustained. “Do you seriously think there is not the slightest/foggiest body of evidence to the contrary?” Not at all, and have repeately and publicly said so. There is a lot of interesting but so far inconclusive evidence for reweaving – just not, in my opinion (which I have to say is getting less humble by ther minute), enough to change my mind. Perhaps if the various cotton observers could regularise their ideas into a coherent opinion, I might change my mind. “Charité bien ordonnée commence par soi même.” No, you’ve foxed me completely with this one… 9:45 “THE other FACT.” “The Shroud was repeatedly sharply bent at both ends each [time] it was stretched for display.” A perfect example of what I suggested in my answer to 9:18 above. Wholly unsubstantiated. 10:15 Ray Rogers’s Thermochimica Acta paper describes evidence for madder root dye and some kind of water soluble gum. That’s as close to a “FACT” as you’re likely to come. If the dye was applied to the Shroud, to conceal some invisible weaving, then there wouldn’t be any on the backing coth unless it was attached to the Shroud before the dying process. If the dye was applied to the backing coth to make it look more like the Shroud, then it would have stained the adjacent areas of the Shroud as well. Interestingly, Rogers claims that there was none of his observed coating on his samples of the Holland coth. However, he does not say from where his samples came.

The first diagram shows, as Rogers captioned it: “A mass spectrum obtained from the pyrolysis of a shroud image fiber,” and the second ” A mass spectrum from the low temperature pyrolysis of fibers from a Raes sample.” I do not know why Rogers omitted a temperature qualification from the first diagram. Nevertheless, some comments are valuable. – The first diagram shows an small amount of furfural (Mass 96, about 5 on the y scale), and a significant amount of hydroxymethylfurfural (Mass 126, about 20 on the y scale). The presence of both these compounds is attributed to the decomposition of cellulose. – The second diagram shows a significant amount of furfural (Mass 96, about 10 on the y scale), and no hydroxymethylfurfural (0 on the y scale). This he attributes to the presence of a significant amount of pentosan. – The implication is that the second diagram shows the composition of the sample at a lower temperature than the sample shown in the first diagram, as it shows no products from the decomposition of cellulose. It would have been better to show the two diagrams as at the same temperature. – The first diagram shows an enormous peak of Mass 131 (Over 100 on the y scale). The second diagram shows a rather smaller peak (about 35 on the y scale). Rogers’s only mention of Mass 131 is to say “Incidentally, the pyrolysis/ms spectra of samples from apparent blood spots showed hydroxyproline peaks at mass 131, a pyrolysis product of animal proteins.” Marco Bella is thus surely justified is saying the Rogers “identifies the peak at mass=131 as hydroxyproline, a hypothesized pyrolysis product of animal proteins.” Unless there is another reason for the peak at 131, Thibault’s announcement “It is simply FALSE. Rogers never said that for good reasons” cannot be justified. Perhaps Rogers admitted of a ‘blood spot’ even on an ‘image’ fibre. – The first diagram shows significant peaks (>30 on the y scale) at Mass 69 and 181. It is a pity that Rogers does not discuss these. The second diagram a succession of decreasing peaks at 56/58, 69/71, 83, and 97 (but note that the x scale does not go further than 150 on this diagram), which Marco Bello shows is consistent with the decomposition of a hydrocarbon. If these peaks are removed from the second diagram, there is indeed little to distinguish it significantly from diagram one. – It is important to recognise that this article only addresses Rogers’ spectrographical comments, not his chemical tests, and I think Rogers’s supporters are correct to feel that Marco Bello’s final conclusion (“The work of the late Dr. Rogers has been exploited to support a pseudoscientific hypothesis which is in no way confirmed by the reported data.”) is unjustified except in this particular aspect. Moving on a little, OK asks, with some justification “What about cotton? What about dye? What about vanillin?” I have been thinking about the vanillin, and in particular Rogers’s comment regarding its decay: “However, some reasonable storage temperatures can be considered to give a range of predicted ages. If the shroud had been stored at a constant 25°C, it would have taken about 1319 years to lose a conservative 95% of its vanillin. At 23°C, it would have taken about 1845 years. At 20 ◦C, it would take about 3095 years.” These figures were derived by direct extrapolation of his version of the Arrhenius equation as it applies to vanillin. By an exactly similar extrapolation, we find that if the temperature was 140°C it would have taken 2 minutes. This means that if the Shroud were ever in a box which became heated to extent that silver melted, there would be no vanillin present, regardless of how recently it had been made. Even if the Raes sample was actually from a piece of modern cloth, the vanillin evidence from the rest of the Shroud does not permit the conclusion that “the cloth must be quite old.” (Whatever that means!)..","date":"2015-09-05","mins":"4:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"id":"comment-209649","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I agree – I agreed above – that sample 1 EB was identified as ‘image’.

I think I’m sufficiently scientifically literate to be able to understand what Rogers wrote and what you made of it, which, since I appear to be the only person who does on this blog, is enough for the time being. While Rogers’s spectral data were derived from experiments carried out in 1981, his chemical investigation was carried out, necessarily on different samples, in 2003/4. He claims he found vanillin in Raes samples and no vanillin in main Shroud samples. As I have explained above, I do not believe that the lack of vanillin demonstrates that the Shroud is older than 1532, but if his Raes threads were genuine (as Thibault has researched), and his Shroud fibres were genuine, and his tests were accurate, then there is something anomalous which needs to be explained. You yourselves might have pointed out that a mass spectrograph for vanillin shows a large peak at Mass 151 and Mass 152 (see: http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C121335&Mask=200), and also that although Rogers showed a full spectrum for his “Shroud” samples, he carefully cut short his “Raes” spectrum at Mass 150. That would have helped confirm your conclusion, unless perhaps vanillin requires a higher temperature spectrograph than these diagrams show. Another interesting thing is that these two diagrams are also reproduced in “Pyrolysis/Mass Spectrometry Applied to the Shroud of Turin” (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers4.pdf), where both are labelled “low temperature”..","date":"2015-09-06","mins":"10:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"id":"comment-209671","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m not sure what this is about, OK, if you’ll forgive me. Accepted wisdom is that during the course of an intense fire in 1532, a silver, or silver covered casket containing the Shroud became so hot that the silver melted and burned through 36 layers of cloth. Silver melts at about 900°C. Even though the thermal conductivity of linen is poor, I think the possibility of any part of the Shroud not achieving 140°C for a couple of minutes is remote. Had it done so, all its vanillin would have been destroyed. On the other hand, if the Shroud were not in a box, and not in a fire, but still had a lump of hot silver collapsed onto it, then it would be much more likely to have remained cold in the middle.

The only version of “Criteria for Authentication” I have access to is via http://holyshroudguild.org/dr nitowski new.html, which does not contain the references or many photographs, and is heavily redacted. From your comment above, am I right in thinking that it was Dr Kohlbeck who made Slides 37 to 53, and Slides 417 to 434, from Rogers’s two slides 1 EB and 6 BF respectively? 1 EB seems to have been taken from the back of the calf, and is described as image, but it seems that Dr Kohlbeck was able to extract at least two possible ‘blood spots’ from it. However, Dr Nitowski’s paper, as of 1986, lists the possessors of the original Slides as follows: “Rogers has 3 slides, Adler has 22, Levi Setti has 18, and I have 21, which totals 64. This matches the original 32 which Rogers says he took from the Shroud, which Mc Crone divided in two.” But this doesn’t make sense, as the slides are never described as, for example, 1 E Ba and 1 E Bb, which they might be if there were two (Mc Crone cut) samples from each original tape. Furthermore, the three slides sent to Rogers were, according to Nitowski, 3 BF, 3 EF, and 6 AF. Is that three original tape samples (six slides) or three of the half samples prepared by Mc Crone? Anyway, what happened next? How did Rogers get hold of Slides (or half sample slides) 1 EB and 6 BF, and what was left of them after Kohlbeck had removed all their contents onto 30 or so new slides? And how did Kohlbeck remove his samples for remounting? Did he peel the tape of the glass and pluck off the fibres, or did he cut through the tape (as, we are told, Frei did with his pollen tapes). If the former, then the chance of new contamination was surely quite high, and if the latter, then what on earth did the original look like after 15 samples had been cut from it? Even more extraordinary is Dr Nitowski, writing years before Rogers claimed to have carried out his observations on his Raes sample, finding, with Dr Kohlbeck, lots of starch and a heavy coating which came away from the fibres beneath. These findings are exactly what Rogers found eight years later, and were communicated to him, but he makes no mention of that at all in his Thermochimica Acta paper, nor of the fact that this thread had been soundly denounced as a fake. I had not read “Criteria for Authentication” until a few moments ago, but it throws a new and murky light on almost all the research carried out on the 1978 Mylar tapes, except possibly the experiments carried out by Heller and Adler – and Walter Mc Crone who, clumsy though he might have been, at least told everybody what he had done. Even Heller and Adler do not appear to know that the tapes had been cut in two before they received them; they simply say that 36 samples were taken and that they received 22 of them, each about 5cm2 in area. As they were not present at Turin, they might not have known what Mc Crone had done, and judging by Heller’s comments about Rogers giving away the entire collection to Mc Crone in the first place, they were no great respecters of Rogers’s competence in material data handling. Can anybody shed any light on all this?.","date":"2015-09-05","mins":"3:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"id":"comment-209708","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thank you, Giorgio. Nitowski’s Slide 1 BF, referenced above, appears to consist of a single piece of sticky tape cut in two and then reassembled, covered with a coverslip which is itself taped down at the edges. I don’t know what the white area is. The total area of the Shroud tape is about 25mm square (625mm2), which compares with Mccrone’s measurement of 5/8″ x 2 1/2″ (16mm x 63.5mm = 1016mm2). This suggests that Slide 1 BF is one of the “half tapes” produced by Mc Crone, further subdivided but then reassembled. Heller and Adler said their tapes were “about 5cm2 in area” (500mm2) which is consistent with their having half an original. Slide 1 AB (the second slide referenced above) is a bit of a mystery. It is captioned “Galss [sic – glass?] slide which held original tape sample, removed for testing” but it is important to recognise that the “original tape samples” were not on glass slides, and were cut in two before mounting. (Or were they? Who wrote “1 AD (1)” and who else – in red – wrote “Mc Crone” “E” and “W” and what in this context do East and West mean?). Weird. Did Mc Crone stick the tapes onto slides first, then label them E and W, and then cut them up and put them on different slides? If 1 BF is one of these, why is it not labelled E or W itself? And why was it cut in two and then reassembled? These are tiny details, of the kind daveb usually thinks I make too much of, but they call into question the integrity of almost everything everyone has ever thought they discovered on the surface of the Shroud, given the possibility of contamination as tapes were cut up, stuck down, peeled off and reassembled somewhat at random and without proper record. Did Rogers ever explain to anyone what his numbers meant, and why there were so many missing? The first number seems to refer roughly to areas of the Shroud (although there are some anomalies), and the last to the Back and Front images, but the middle sequences are incomplete. Series 1, from A to J, omits C, Series 3 B omits 3 DB, Series 4 omits A, B and D, and so on. In a page from a notebook (whose?) in Dr Nitowski’s “Criteria for Authentication” showing the locations of tape samples,Tape 1 CB is marked, but 1 CJ is not; there are only two in the 2 series, although there were 4 in Mc Crone’s collection; 3 DB, 4 A, B, C and D are marked but not in the final collection, and whole series 7 and 8 are marked, covering the head and shoulders, but not present. These last, as someone pointed out, may have been ‘withdrawn’ either before or after testing, after John Jackson’s altercation with Max Frei.

My remark was entirely related to the paper I was commenting on, in which, perhaps by coincidence, all the discrepancies noted by the authors made the radiocarbon date older than the historical date, so that, if any extrapolation were to be made to the Shroud, it would carbon date as older than it actually is, even if the samples taken were agreed to be representative. Neither the paper nor my comments had anything to do with whether a sample is representative or not, except perhaps in the context of the ‘old wood’ effect. So, of course a sample has to be chronologically representative of the object to be dated. Astounding though it seems to authenticists, even non authenticists can ‘get their heads around’ that. Furthermore, the most detailed examination of the evidence suggesting that the radiocarbon sample was not representative was carried out by myself. Who was the first person to notice that the quad mosaic images have a broad blue band covering the image which demonstrates that the green corners cannot be considered definitive evidence of chemical inconsistency? Who was the first person to notice a video featuring Ray Rogers talking about UV fluorescence, while the camera zoomed meaningfully into a close up of Jesus’s buttocks, apparently thinking it was the radiocarbon corner? Who was the first person to show that Ray Schneider’s pronouncement at St Louis, saying that there was 99.9% correlation between an alleged UV colour discrepancy and the alleged contamination of the Shroud in fact demonstrated that the contamination made the Shroud appear older, not younger, than it really is? Who was the first person to tabulate the various proportions of cotton found in various threads from the Shroud by various microscopists and show that they were inconsistent? Who was the first person to notice that Jeffrey Skurka’s image purporting to show evidence of a radiocarbon discrepancy was actually taken from a leaflet simply illustrating the procedure? Who is the only person to have suggested that Ray Rogers’s discovery of madder and water soluble plant gum could be interpreted as anything other than an attempt to make interpolated threads look the same as the original? Who? Yup, moi, from start to finish. And how have I ignored any contradictory evidence? What have I said about Rogers’s vanillin findings? What have I said about Fanti’s mechanical findings? What have I said about the ‘invisible mending’ hypothesis? Right. Now what do we make of all this? There is evidence both in favour of, and against, the possibility that the radiocarbon sample was not representative of the Shroud as a whole. All I have ever declared is that to my mind, the evidence suggesting this is not as compelling as the evidence denying it. There have been, it is true, persistent attempts to change my mind, but they have never produced any other evidence than what I have analysed myself. I do not deny others’ rights to feel that that the evidence persuades them differently. I do not accuse them of ignoring the contrary evidence, of stupidity or of not being able to understand me.

This paper raises some interesting questions regarding minor discrepancies in some ancient radiocarbon dating with minimal relevance to Medieval Europe. It is well known that atmospheric C14 varies over time, which is why experimentally derived dates “before present” have to be calibrated against a zig zag line, derived mostly from tree ring dating, to produce a calendar date. The authors find that even this does not match radiocarbon findings with accurately known dates in some circumstances, particularly connected with ancient Egyptology, and explore some reasons why. Local variations in atmospheric C14, cause by volcanic eruptions or marine upwelling, for example, and the ‘old wood’ effect, which, by relating the radiocarbon date of part of a long lived tree to the site where it was used for construction, leads to an older than accurate date for an event such as the site’s construction or destruction. However, the thrust of Zerbst and van der Veen’s paper, as exemplified by their last example, that of the discrepancy of 200 years between the radiocarbon and historically accepted dates of the destruction of Nineveh, is not that the radiocarbon date is wrong, but that a serious review of the of the accepted historical date is required. Finally, the last nail in the ‘the carbon dating must be wrong’ aspiration, is that the radiocarbon date discrepancy invariably makes the radiocarbon date older than the calendar date. Although this paper has no relevance whatsoever to the Shroud, if it had, it would demonstrate that the date of manufacture must later than the radiocarbon date, not earlier, and lend credence to the da Vinci hypothesis..","date":"2015-08-23","mins":"4:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/22/food-for-thought-an-important-paper-on-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Food for Thought: An Important Paper on Radiocarbon Dating"},{"id":"comment-208912","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Do my qualifications matter?

Linick says that proving the shroud to be first century “leaves room for argument” and “it would be the right age, but is it the real thing?” This is not a refusal to accept authenticity – it could very well be a rhetorical question posed by an authenticist, who might then go on to demonstrate that the answer is yes. – Linick was probably aware of Mc Crone’s prediction that the Shroud’s carbon date would be “about 1355.” Jones puts forward no evidence for this. His comparison of Jones’s rhetorical question with Mc Crone’s assumption that a 1st century shroud would be accepted as genuine by nearly everyone is specious. But so what? Dozens of people could have read Mc Crone’s predictions, as they were published years previously. Even if he hadn’t read Mc Crone’s work, the range of likely dates, either 1st century or 13th 14th century, was obvious to everybody. – Linick was the leaker of Arizona’s “1350” first date of the Shroud. Jones puts forward no evidence for this. He claims that for Sox simply to quote’s Linick’s rhetorical question above is “proof beyond reasonable doubt that Linick was the leaker.” Well, it isn’t, is it? – Linick was found dead of suspected suicide on 4 June 1989. Jones puts forward no evidence for this. His death, according to the obituary by Timothy Jull, was “untimely,” and according to Bruno Bonnet Eymard, was “in unclear circumstances.” This is not evidence of suicide, nor of murder. A Vatican insider article in 2013 claims suicide, but gives no reference. This is an unwarranted escalation of suggestion; it is not evidence. Jones is unable to find published information on Linick’s death in Arizona (a ‘closed record’ state). Had he tried a common genealogy program he would have found trhat Linick’s death was registered in California, not Arizona. Jones’s next three points are less controversial: Linick was a measurement scientist, the AMS apparatus required a program to assess its results, and there were six weeks between the cutting of the sampels and the radiocarbon dating in Arizona. None of it, of course, is evidence for any Soviet plot. After that, we discover that Jones’s allegations were sent, by me, without his permission, to Timothy Jull and Christopher Ramsey, who lied in their responses. For what it’s worth I also sent the Arizona laboratory a large chunk of Part 1 of Jones’s allegations, and have now sent them and Prof. Ramsey a substantial part of these latest libels. I do not need a libeller’s permission to report his libels to the people he is libelling, nor does his pitiful plea of copyright cut any ice with me..","date":"2014-07-05","mins":"2:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/05/stephen-jones-continues-his-computer-hacking-conspiracy-theory/","cat":"conspiracy_theory","title":"Stephen Jones  Continues his Computer Hacking Conspiracy Theory"},{"id":"comment-124070","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’ve asked the AMS lab at Arizona University if they’d like to comment. Meanwhile, can I look at Stephen’s often mentioned statistic from Harry Gove: “The other question that has been asked is: if the statistical probability that the shroud dates between 1260 and 1390 is 95%, what is the probability that it could date to the first century? The answer is about one in a thousand trillion, i.e. Vanishingly small.” I don’t think Stephen understands how this was calculated, or why it is not applicable the other way round. It is a purely statistical calculation, relating to the variability of the results of the radiocarbon measurement, and is meaningless if taken literally. Harry Gove meant it as an esoteric joke. Suppose, for the sake of example, that five people count a flock of sheep. They return with the figures 63, 67, 61, 65 and 64. What, asks a statistician, is the probability that there are in fact only 4 sheep in the field? To anybody (even a statistician) the answer is none whatever, but statistically the answer is not zero, and is calculable. The Standard Deviation of the figures is 2.24, and 4 sheep is about 27 Standard Deviations (SD) from the Mean. The chances of a number being less than 1 SD is about 16%, less than 2 SD is about 2.3%, and less than 3 SD is about 0.2%. I can’t find a table that lists the probability of a number less than 27 SD; it is both “vanishingly small” and also, significantly, not zero. This was Harry Gove’s calculation for the Turin Shroud. The Mean and Standard Deviation for the radiocarbon dates was known, and the first century was sufficient Standard Deviations away for the statistical probability to be one in a thousand trillion or so. Of course, years, like sheep, are discrete objects, and not infinitely divisible like numbers, so the number is meaningless; Gove meant it as a joke, of course. Stephen seems to take it seriously, ignoring the fact that any year selected randomly between 4 billion BC and the present has a quarter of a million times better chance of being correct than one in a thousand trillion..","date":"2014-05-24","mins":"1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/24/stephen-jones-the-kgb-allegedly-executed-both-shroud-of-turin-hackers/","cat":"hacking","title":"Stephen Jones: The KGB allegedly executed both Shroud of Turin Hackers"},{"id":"comment-124387","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Ah!

But as I have said before; if this stuff is not discussed, then it can be taken as approved of, which I don’t. Stephen’s chart showing the non overlapping ranges of the averages of the laboratories’ dates is wrong. He has blithely assumed that BP dates can be converted into AD dates simply by subtracting them from 1950, which is wrong to start with, but also he has not taken into account a particular anomaly in the calibration curve during the 13th century, whereby, for example, a BP date of 650 can indicate an AD date of either 1300 or 1375, but not 1325 1350. Properly calibrated, all three labs’ dates overlap, although it is true that Oxford’s overlaps the other two the least. The Arizona and Zurich samples overlap considerably more than indicated by Jones’s simplistic treatment. Although Riani & Atkinson have demonstrated a statistical chronological gradient across the sample, which may be due to minor contamination to an increased degree, but in no way invalidates the radiocarbon dates, and provides good evidence that the 12 BP dates produced by the labs were not randomly variant about 1325 as Jones suggests, and thus not randomly generated by a computer program. As it happens 1325 AD corresponds to a BP date of almost exactly 600, so one would expect random numbers to cluster around that figure. Paradoxically, just as there is only a 5% chance that the Oxford and Arizona dates represent exactly the same age of cloth, so there is only a 5% chance of achieving the same result using a random number generator. If Jones is wedded to his spy theory, then he must accept that there is no discrepancy between the radiocarbon dates, in which case there is no need to explain their innacuracy by means of a random number generator!.","date":"2014-06-13","mins":"11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/13/the-beat-goes-on/","cat":"hacking","title":"The Beat Goes On"},{"id":"comment-130883","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Stop Press: A little while ago Stephen either read this blog, or someone told him of the post above, and he inserted a comment into his latest posting to the effect that he realised his dates and chart with its non overlapping bands were based on BP dates and needed calibrating. This he has now done, and amended his blog to show a new set of dates and a new chart which, curiously, still shows that the Oxford dates do not overlap either of the others. By using the tiny calibration diagram published in the Nature paper rather than an established calibration program, he has enabled himself to reinforce his convictions. This cannot be allowed to go uncriticised. It is not clear that Stephen really understands the calibrating process, particularly when it comes to how to deal with quoted errors. Actually anybody can do it by using Ox Cal, which is online, easy to access, easy to use, and free. Stephen tried to do it using the tiny published calibration chart in the Nature paper, deriving his dates simply by adding and subtracting the error from the mean as published in the Nature paper, and attempting to read off the calendar date. His results, and those from Ox Cal (to 95.4% probability) are as follows: Arizona BP dates: 646 ± 31 Stephen’s calibration: 1290 – 1317 Ox Cal’s calibration: 1281 – 1396 Oxford BP dates: 750 ± 30 Stephen’s calibration: 1214 – 1266 Ox Cal’s calibration: 1222 – 1287 Zurich BP dates: 676 ± 24 Stephen’s calibration: 1286 – 1293 Ox Cal’s calibration: 1275 – 1388 Well, it’s only a few years here and there, what does it matter? But Stephen is a great pains to point out that by his calculation the Oxford dates still do not overlap either of the other two – which of course is untrue, and that the Arizona and Zurich dates only overlap by 25 years, which is also untrue. His finding of a minimum Oxford date of 1214 is grotesquely inaccurate and must surely be a typo, but his even more inaccurate maximum misreading has a serious effect on his later argument – I wonder if it could be deliberate fraud?.","date":"2014-06-18","mins":"3:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/13/the-beat-goes-on/","cat":"hacking","title":"The Beat Goes On"},{"id":"comment-40899","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, I follow your reasoning. 70% of the Carbon dating area must be 16th century or later. That’s all the weft and nearly half the warp threads, or maybe 7/10 of both. So, 1) Try examining Barrie Schwortz’s photos at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/arizona.pdf. The piece photographed contains about 45 threads. If the interweave theory is correct, around 30 are new and 15 old. Can you identify which are which? Can invisible weaving really be that invisible? 2) The next photo that needs examining closely is the x ray of the foot of the cloth in http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf. (Figure 7). It is poorly reproduced here, but very clearly in Schwalbe & Rogers, Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin. There is continuous warp and weft banding right through the C 14 area, and no evidence of interpolated threads, although Benford and Marino, using a very poor copy in their paper, think they see one ‘break’ in one ‘intensity’ line. 3) Next, the actual dates of the Damon Nature paper have never been queried by statisticians, let alone massacred. The best analysis of the data is by Riani, Atkkinson et al, who do demonstrate, using the data which they do not query, that there is indeed a clear chronological progression along the sample area. This accounts very well for the anomalous chi squared value and its 5% significance, and does indeed suggest contamination, but it does nothing to suggest that any part of the sample area is from the 1st century. 4) Finally, however invisible mending is carried out, it results in the new threads running alongside the old threads for some distance as they merge. Sadly I don’t have the much touted Shroud App, as I don’t have an i Pad, but if the HD image is as clear as they say, it will surely be possible to examine the area around the C 14 excision and post a screen grab showing these parallel weavings.

However muddled the processes leading up to the sample taking, and however irregular the management of the results, there is no suggestion in Philippe Bourcier de Carbon’s list, that the samples purported to be from the shroud were not from the shroud, or that the date of those fragments was not as reported. Bruno Bonnet Eymard, of course, does think that the samples were deliberately switched, but his evidence is tenuous and circumstantial. That takes us to Benford, Marino and Rogers, who without doubting the genuineness of the samples or the integrity of the tests, have to establish that between 70% and 90% of the tested material was interpolated into the shroud, in such a way as to be invisible to the naked eye. This is far from established on a number of counts, of which I will address two. 1) In their “Evidence for the skewing of the C14 Dating” paper (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marben.pdf), Benford and Marino present a diagram of where they think a patch was attached. However, this would only produce the required dates if the 12 sub samples actually tested were cut in ribbons from top to bottom of the original same strip. If the samples were cut ‘horizontally,’ then one would expect some dates to be entirely 16th century, some to be entirely 1st century, and only, possibly, a middle one to be a mixture of the two. As we know, a substantial portion of the Tucson sample was not dated at all, but retained. The dated fractions would therefore be almost entirely 16th or 1st, with no intermediates. We also know that the Zurich sample was first cut horizontally into two pieces, and then these two further divided. The dates obtained by the Zurich labs do not match a “patch” scenario. A refinement of the “patch” scenario is the “interweaving” scenario. In this case the repair is not hypothesised to be a patch replacing a hole, but a replacement of up to 90% worn out threads across the entire sample area, leaving only a few (between 3 in ten and 1 in ten) of the original threads behind. It is not clear what the extent of this interweaving beyond the sample area might be. 2) It must be noted that the huge amount of 16th century or later material cannot be from additions (paint, glue, bacteria) to the cloth, as this was thoroughly disposed of by the cleaning procedure; it must come from the replacement threads themselves. There are various theories about these threads: they are all made of 16th century cotton, they are made of 16th century cotton interspersed with 16th century linen, or they are 16th century cotton interspersed with 1st century linen. Sadly, nobody has been able to study more than a handful of these threads, and what they have found is inconclusive. Rogers (http://www.shroud.it/ROGERS 3.PDF), Heimburger (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part1.pdf) and Fanti (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/fantir7appendix.pdf) all found cotton mixed with linen. The question is, whether the proportion of cotton to linen is sufficiently different between the C 14 area threads and the rest to show that the two are different. Rogers doesn’t say what the proportion of cotton to linen was in his selection. Heimburger studied a 1cm Raes length of thread extensively, and concluded: “R7 [the thread he studied] is definitely some kind of blended thread: cotton (10% 20%)/linen (80% 90%).” Fanti studied about 0.5mm of a thread extracted from the C 14 area and concluded: “The relatively small percentage of cotton fibres of (4/188=) 2.1% is in agreement with the hypothesis that cotton was a contaminant in the ambient where linen threads were prerared.” Mysteriously, Villarreal (http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm) conducted FTIR experiments on three similar threads, one of which was purported made of two ends stuck together with glue (for some reason sometimes referred to as a splice), and found they were all cotton. These three conclusions appear inconsistent. The main body of the cloth appears to contain traces of cotton, noticed by Mc Crone, Maloney and even Rogers, but as far as I know no one has quantified it. I agree wholeheartedly that the unconditional acceptance of the C 14 date is not the mark of a ‘true scientist,’ but submit that the unconditional rejection of it is even less so..","date":"2013-08-09","mins":"9:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/how-can-any-true-scientist-unconditionally-defend-the-c14-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"How can any true scientist unconditionally defend the C14 dating?"},{"id":"comment-40955","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, OK, for your analysis. Aa) The average weight of the shroud. I can’t find when this was established. When was the shroud weighed – and how? Presumably it was during the 2002 restoration, after the patches and backing cloth were removed. Was it rolled up and weighed then? Or is the rather precise mg/cm2 number an over precise conversion of what was originally not much more than a guess, based on the overall weight and size of the whole thing? Ab) Never mind. Accepting the average weight of the shroud for a moment, the C 14 sample is supposed to be of more than 50% heavier material than the rest of it. What does this mean in terms of an invisible reweave? That the threads are much closer together – no, because this would be clearly visible. That the threads are much thicker – no, because this would be clearly visible (and anyway Benford & Marino specifically point to what they think are thinner interpolations on the Zurich sample). That the admixture of cotton significantly increases the density of the thread – no, because flax fibres have a density of about 1.45g/cm3 while cotton fibres have a density of about 1.55g/cm3. Ac) My explanation for the anomaly is the inaccuracy of the quoted mass of the whole shroud, coupled to local variations in weave density. Can you account for the increased density of the C 14 area? 1) I don’t know what visual difference there would be between 16th and 1st century thread. I was arbitrarily assuming that there was some! Does that sound unscientific? Let’s have another try. Rogers thought he had discovered that the interpolated material had been dyed in order to match the colour of the shroud. I think it unlikely that the two colours would match so perfectly as to be indistinguishable, even under a microscope. Apart from that, new thread might be visibly thicker/thinner, looser/denser or even rougher/smoother. A demonstration that 15 of the Schwortz sample threads look different from the rest would be convincing, but I don’t find that. 2) The banding seems clear right the way across the photos. Are you suggesting a patch over, say, 20cm wide and high? Only that would account for the uninterrupted stripes that are clearly observable. 3) No again. Remi van Haelst and Riani & Atkinson demonstrate inconsistencies in the statistical analyses which are perfectly valid. However, to suggest that that means that no information at all can be derived from the radiocarbon results is absurd. Assuming that the raw data is acceptable, and at no point do our statisticians dispute that, a collection of 12 independent dates between 1200 and 1400 cannot be rejected with a simple, “It could be from the 1st century, it could be from the 11th century.” Statistically, that’s an imprecision vastly more unlikely than the precision quoted by the Nature paper. 4) In this case, you don’t have to distinguish between threads of different ages; you simply have to show a bit of anomalous weaving, where two threads run alongside each other for a few millimetres, as the new thread is woven into the pattern. As I say, there must be hundreds of places where that happens..","date":"2013-08-11","mins":"5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/08/how-can-any-true-scientist-unconditionally-defend-the-c14-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"How can any true scientist unconditionally defend the C14 dating?"},{"id":"comment-40980","author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s interesting. Gilbert Raes’s measurement comes from his tiny fraction of the shroud which he extrapolated to the whole thing and which, according to the patch hypothesis, was only partly composed of original shroud anyway. Verginio Timossi’s measurement comes from a copy of the shroud, not the original at all. RA Morris estimated the density of the Shroud from Compton scatter, again not by actually weighing the shroud, and gave a combined shroud/backing density of 30 40mg/cm2. Dividing this proportionately between the measured thickness for the backing and shroud (270/345) gave about 20mg/cm2 for the shroud and 15mg/cm2 for the backing, although Schwalbe & Rogers considered the shroud value too low, considering “the comparatively open weave structure of the backing cloth.” I can’t find where Riggi gets his estimate from. The fact remains that nobody at all has ever actually weighed the shroud, with or without its backing cloth. Freer Waters & Jull examined a fragment of the C 14 sample weighing 12.39mg. Their piece was photographed, with a scale, by Barrie Schwortz, and can be accurately measured as about 56 square millimetres. That makes a C 14 density of 22mg/cm2. That corresponds well with the overall calculated density in the paragraph above, but is in distinct disagreement with your 36.89mg/cm2, or even the Paris 1989 reported measurements (8.1 x 1.6 cm, weight 0.497g; density : 38.3mg/cm2). However, Brian Walsh disputes these measurements. Riani and Atkinson, using Walsh’s figures, give an original size of 8.1 x 2.1 cm, which would give a density of 29.2mg/cm2, and a trimmed size of 8.1 x 1.6 cm, which would give a C 14 density of 23.1 mg/cm2. All in all I do not find any of these figures sufficiently well established to agree that the C 14 sample has a different density from the rest of the shroud.

I think Pam has argued her case as well as possible, and I like the reconstructions of the radiocarbon corner (so similar to my own, dear reader, as you will recall…) However, among the throwaway remarks upon which some of the rest of the paper depends is this, in the second paragraph of page 2: “The Holland cloth at A was covered by a patch (see detail) which had been removed before this photograph was taken.” I don’t believe this is true. I have never heard that a patch was sewn on over the Holland cloth between 1978 and 1988, and the X Ray photos of 1978 most definitely show no patch, so where did that idea come from? The second paragraph of page 4, and an accompanying illustration, drags in the Quad Mosaics again. “There is a density of colour in the fabric taken for radiocarbon date in Barrie Schwortz’s image and the unusual dark green in the corner of the Quad Mosaic is not seen elsewhere on the Shroud.” Actually the unusual dark green is seen in almost every corner of each of the four mosaics, or at least a colour so similar that a picture of the dorsal torso was mistaken for the picture of the ventral legs in a documentary devoted to that very subject. Part of the point of the paper is that a dye was rubbed onto the ‘mended’ Shroud in order to match the colours. Well it was a pretty poor shot, wasn’t it, since the dye is, according to both Rogers and Pam, so conspicuously different from the cloth it was supposed to emulate. At the top of page 6 Rogers is quoted as saying, “17) The colored encrustation does not seem to stick to linen as well as cotton. Some linen fibers appear to be nearly clean, but the cotton fibrils can be heavily encrusted in the same thread sample. This suggests that the cotton was added to the Raes threads to make dyeing possible. The cotton in the threads would have made color matching easier. Linen is difficult to dye or stain.” I think this last sentence is naive. Dyed linen is perfectly common. Linen may be more difficult to dye than cotton, but that’s a relative term. Furthermore, ‘encrustations’ are not evidence of dye. Dye, as Teresinha Roberts points out on page 10, is irrevocably bonded to the fibres of the material being dyed. Encrustations are easily removed. The bottom of page 6 shows one of the Raes threads, which, it is claimed “is a splice of linen and cotton held together with a terpene crust.” I don’t think this is the same thread which Villarreal claimed was that. Either way, it is not a splice but an end to end joint, which has no structural strength whatever. “One end of the yarn is a different colour to the other.” I disagree. I think the colour here is an artefact of the lighting. On page 2 and page 7 Pam notices that the dye has penetrated both the radiocarbon corner and the Holland cloth adjacent and underneath it. This is in contradiction of Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta paper, page 191, “There was absolutely no coating with these characteristics on either the Holland cloth or the main part of the shroud.” It was this observation that led me to abandon a hypothesis I put forward almost two years ago, on this site (Cat among the Pigeons, 14 Jan 2014): “Disappointingly, I cannot find a picture of the radiocarbon corner, including the backing cloth, taken after the sample was cut, but before the Holland cloth was replaced. Can anyone help? [I found one later – the ones Pam uses.] Because I predict (dangerous), that the area that had been concealed under the radiocarbon sample area will be as white as the area that had been under the Raes sample area. How to explain this? Was something smeared over that corner, and, for that matter, the burn holes as well, after the shroud had been stitched to the Holland cloth, to try to make the colours more uniform? Did it include a mixture of madder root dye and gum arabic? And was it applied with a cotton pad? Are shreds of cotton, dyed with madder and glued down with gum arabic, found along the edges of the shroud adjacent to the Holland cloth – including the edges of the burn holes? It’s new, it’s revolutionary, and you read it here first, folks!” Later on page 10, Rogers is quoted as saying that: “Ray Roger’s experiments with fibres from the Raes sample showed that the dye was removed with 6 N H Cl and the gum with concentrated H Cl. The processes from Arizona, Oxford and Zurich are reproduced below and none of the laboratories used sufficient concentration of H Cl to remove the dye or the gum.” While the above is perfectly true, Rogers also said that the gum was soluble in water, and all the cleaning processes used by the three laboratories were certainly capable of doing that. Finally, it is implied that the dye could have substantially affected the radiocarbon date. (e.g. Page 1: “The dye which was not removed by the pre cleaning of the samples invalidates the carbon date results.” Well, no it doesn’t. It may slightly affect the radiocarbon results (and according to Ray Schneider’s St Louis presentation it makes the Shroud appear older than it actually is), but it certainly doesn’t invalidate them. All this from a rather quick first reading of the paper.

However, I would still like a couple to be addressed, especially the one about Rogers insisting that there was no dye or gum on the Holland cloth. As you know, I originally attributed Rogers’s ‘dye’ not to any attempt to match new Shroud fibres with old, but to match the Holland cloth to the Shroud, just in the corners where pieces of the Shroud had been cut off, and possibly, although I don’t know how to check this, where it was visible through various unpatched holes. The dye, I thought, might have been smeared on, and some of it smeared onto the Shroud itself. But Rogers was quite positive that there was no dye on the Holland cloth. Pam’s paper suggests that she disagrees with this. It may be that Rogers only looked at Holland cloth threads from underneath the Shroud (the Raes corner in particular), where no dye had made contact. The other point is that although the gum was hydrolysed by concentrated H Cl, it did not require hydrolysis to remove it; water was entirely sufficient, as the gum dissolved in water. Another point that occurs to me is the contradistinction found in this paragraph: 17) The colored encrustation does not seem to stick to linen as well as cotton. Some linen fibres appear to be nearly clean, and the cotton fibrils can be heavily encrusted in the same thread sample. This suggests that cotton was added to the Raes threads to make dyeing possible. The cotton in the threads would have made color matching easier. Linen is difficult to dye or stain.” Surely this is evidence that the linen had actually absorbed the dye into it, while the cotton still had lumps of it sticking on the top, not penetrating the fibrils, and easy to remove. It would be interesting to know what Teresinha Roberts has to say about that..","date":"2015-12-13","mins":"9:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/09/important-new-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-samples/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Important New Paper on the Carbon Dating Samples"},{"id":"comment-216430","author":"hugh_farey","post":"As the dye would make minimal difference to the radiocarbon date, it doesn’t really matter.

This is the viewpoint of “Whips and Angels, Painting on Cloth in the Medieval Period” by Linnet Kestrel, and “Medieval Painted Flags, A Study” by Rebecca Robynson, both of whom think that gesso was omitted altogether in these circumstances. Cennino Cennini himself, the earliest source of medieval techniques, discusses movable cloth in Chapters 163 (curtains), 165 (flags) and 173 (including skirts) of “Il Libro dell’ Arte o Tratato della Pittura” and is a little less clear, but it is certainly not obvious that gesso was involved. In his advice for preparation of linen generally, however, he suggests applying gesso and them immediately scraping it all off again, as if to leave particulate gesso glued among the threads of the cloth, and that might have resulted in a flexible ground, and is probably the technique you are thinking of. I do not know how crumbly this would be when rolled or folded.

The exposed bits of the Holland cloth (the missing corners and the burn holes at the end of the cloth) do not fluoresce at all. Their fluorescence has been effectively smothered – by what? 3) The cotton question is significant, but without some agreement as to how much there is and whether it is spun into the threads, woven into the cloth or merely surface contamination it doesn’t lead anywhere. 4) I think the exposed Holland cloth and other holes were dyed to match the shroud, which dye accounts for the difference in colour on the shroud around these areas. I do not think the dye significantly affects the radiocarbon dating. 5) There is insufficient evidence about the vanillin to determine whether it is significant or not. 6) The radiocarbon corner was heavily attached onto the Holland cloth. The holes for the sewing are still clearly visible. These were the anomalous threads rejected by Riggi, together with the “side seam” which was probably reinforced in that area. 7) Actually it was almost inevitable that the Shroud sample would come from that particular place.

Morgan III’s paper ‘Digital image processing techniques demonstrating the anomalous nature of the radiocarbon dating sample area of the Shroud of Turin’ at http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1380798975 Morgan.pdf, where he shows that the radiocarbon samples are increasingly contaminated the closer they are to the corner, and on Ray Schneider’s St Louis paper, ‘Dating The Shroud Of Turin: Weighing All The Evidence’ at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlschneiderpaper.pdf, where he shows a 99.93% correlation between the radiocarbon dates and the UV fluorescence. Claim: “There is no visible evidence, at any magnification, either of the enormous contamination or the enormous interweaving which would be necessary to discredit the radiocarbon date.” I don’t believe anyone disputes that massive contamination would be necessary to convert a 1st century date into a medieval one. None of Donna Campbell’s investigation in to the Oxford samples, or of Freer Waters’s investigation into a reserved piece of the Tucson sample, show anything like the contamination required. Campbell’s conclusion is a model of professional restraint, and the closest she can get to evidence for the massive contamination required is a mention of the discrepancy in the spacing of the threads, which “could suggest the use of different yarns.” And of course I noted the discovery of cotton fibres by the Oxford lab. I’ve no doubt all the labs discovered all sorts of things covering their samples; that’s why they examined them microscopically and cleaned them with ultra sound and vacuum pipettes. Similarly, nothing in Rogers of any of the LANL scientists’ finding comes even remotely close to the 65/35 modern/ancient proportions required for the job.

Of the 12 mean calendar dates derived from the 12 BP dates given by the three laboratories, only one lies outside the 1260 1390 range chalked on the board behind Hall, Tite and Hedges, and even so the range of its dates (1044 1298) overlaps the range 1260 1390. Stephen E. Jones is thus wholly incorrect in his statement that “none of the three laboratories dated its sample to between 1260 and 1390” and consequently wholly incorrect in his impugning of Prof. Hedges.

However, the S Tu RP team did not extract any threads, only fibres, on their sticky tapes, which must obviously have come from the surfaces of the threads. Maloney does not say how he knows about the the inside of the ‘main body’ threads. 2) I found it very interesting that “all of the implications” were that the position from which the radiocarbon sample was to come was the Raes corner as early as November 1987. I wonder what Riggi and Gonella argued about on the morning of the cutting! 3) Another interesting point concerns the attaching of new threads when old ones run out, particularly with reference to the Egyptian cloth (Figure 7, Page 25, and the diagram on Page 26). There is no way that the photos on Pages 12 (Figure 7) and 15 can be ‘splices’ in any recognised sense of the world. Any attempt to unravel the ends of two submillimetre threads by a few mm and then to reravel them together in such a way that they do not come apart (which is what a splice is) would be wholly fruitless, and in this case I do not even believe they are two ends of different threads anyway..","date":"2014-12-21","mins":"6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/19/just-published-what-went-wrong-with-the-radiocarbon-date/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Just Published:  What Went Wrong with the Radiocarbon Date?"},{"id":"comment-178761","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, Thibault, that clarifies Maloney’s position well.

The authors find that their radiocarbon dating of old peat bogs was improved by treating their macrofossils in glycerine thymol ethyl alcohol mixture, and then rinsing them with alcohol. They say: “The interesting fact is that most of the dates from the Skaliska Basin carried out from macrofossils treated by a mixture of glycerine, thymol and ethyl alcohol (but pretreated by rinsing them in alcohol) reflected a reliable age in comparison with that deduced from palynological analysis. The aforementioned observations give a far reaching possibility of dating profiles investigated in the past, from which macrofossils have already been identified and collected (and thus preserved in glycerine thymol ethyl alcohol mixture).” They clearly do not think that even ancient (3000 BC) material is likely to be ruined from a radiocarbon dating point of view by preserving it in thymol, so 2000 year old material would be even less so.

In this case gradually increasing density of colour has been organised into stripes, rather like coloured contours on relief maps. Wikipedia explains k means clustering quite well. Furthermore, I dispute that the density of colour is directly related to contamination density. It is at least partly, and perhaps mainly, related to the intensity of the light shining on that area, and probably also to the angle at which the light is reflecting. Finally, if these photos do in fact indicate contamination, then the more the contamination, the older the Shroud appears. This could perhaps be due to a mineral oil being an important part of it: mineral oil has a C14 content of zero, and I understand is particularly difficult to remove from radiocarbon samples. If Rogers’s dye, which I think was actually smeared onto the Holland cloth and only incidentally spread over onto the Shroud, contained a mineral oil component, that might explain the anomaly.

I have examined the Quad Mosaic photographs, the alleged UV F photographs, the Morris manipulations of the alleged UV F photographs, Barrie Schwortz’s transmitted light photographs and his close ups of the retained Arizona sample, the Oxford Accelerator Unit’s photographs of their sample before it was destroyed, Morris’s X Ray photographs, Shroud Scope, Shroud 2.0, and the black and white enlargement of the Raes sample. I have read everything Sue Benford, Joe Marino, Ray Rogers, Robert Villarreal, Remi van Haelst, Thibault Heinburger, Riani et al. And Uncle Tim Cobbley have written on the subject. And I have found no evidence that there is sufficient admixture of material from more modern times to account for the 1300 year discrepancy observed in the radiocarbon date. Nor, as far as I know, has anybody else. Now for the (long awaited) answers to your questions, which, if you’ll allow me, I shall rephrase to make them more sensible, 1) Did anybody examine the radiocarbon sample at high magnification, before or after it was cut? As far as I know, only the scientists at the radiocarbon laboratories themselves, although the photos of the reserved Arizona sample taken by Barrie and the photos of the tested sample taken by the Oxford laboratories are now available to anybody. 2) Did Mechthild Flury Lemberg examine the radiocarbon sample at all? Not as far as I know. 3) Have I examined the radiocarbon sample at all? Only from the published photos referred to above. 3) Is there any evidence of substantial interweaving outside the radiocarbon sample? No. 4) Is there any evidence of substantial interweaving within the radiocarbon sample? Not on the photographs described above. 5) Could substantial interweaving be present but invisible on the photographs described above? No. Every thread is easily followed from one side to the other. 6) Could truly invisible interpolation have occurred on the Shroud? Yes. If the original threads were individually separated from each other, individually unravelled, and each individually twisted together with a new thread, also with its end unravelled, and these threads then rewoven to match the original weave, then the interpolation could be truly invisible..","date":"2015-04-02","mins":"8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"id":"comment-195199","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I can’t get the link to work, but never mind.

I agree I am being generous, However, I’m not clear that anybody studied the radiocarbon area with a microscope while it was still part of the cloth. Perhaps Thibault can tell us more about “In 1988, the textile experts looked at this area with binocular microscopes.” When did they do that? Was it during the hours of argument between Gonella and Riggi leading up to the actual cutting? And Flury Lemberg, as far as I know, did not have microscopic access to the Shroud until 2002, long after the sample itself had gone. As for invisible mending, I agree that to my knowledge nobody has ever carried out the procedure I described, namely the unravelling of individual threads, merging them by bringing the unravelled threads together, and then twisting them back up together again to produce a true spliced extended thread. I also think that this would need an unravelling of at least 1 2cm of each thread, which is why it would be impossible to produce such a splice wholly within the radiocarbon sample area. However, I believe that if anybody actually did that, then it could be invisible even under a microscope. In fact, of course, all the “invisible mending” techniques currently used actually rely simply on lying new threads alongside old ones, which is clearly visible under a microscope, or by simply twisting two threads together (illustrated in one of Sue Benford’s papers), without unravelling them, which is also visible under a microscope. What I am doing here is bending over backwards to help those who think the radiocarbon dating is wrong to find an area of investigation which might help them justify their case, all other possibilities having been found wanting, either by consisting of insufficient contamination or by not having evidence of their existence at all. “I’m sorry but your usual prudence has abandoned you in this occasion.” Not at all; my prudence has excelled itself!.","date":"2015-04-03","mins":"3:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"id":"comment-195281","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Louis; I’ve been able to access your link now.

How John Klotz manipulates the evidence. As it was, it was worth a mention as a possible point of discussion; as it is, it is somewhat overhyped, and surely damages the very cause he is trying to champion. “The ignorance of the interlocutor and those on this blog who will defend carbon dating to the end.” This is just rude. There are many on this blog who think that the radiocarbon dating is correct. We will not defend this conclusion in the face of any convincing evidence to the contrary, but so far, such evidence had not been forthcoming. “Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place.” He did indeed. And he removed them, in case they were contaminants. “The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin.” Possibly. Quite so. And possibly not. “It may have been used for repairs.” Possibly. Although the greater the probability that it was used for repairs, the smaller the probability that it was of Egyptian origin. “Or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ Yes, indeed, it may be contemporaneous with the weaving of the Shroud, medieval or first century. ” [Gilbert Raes] deduced that this was a strong indication of Middle Eastern manufacture.” Did he? What did he actually say? ‘In view of these observations, one can say that we have no precise indication permitting us to affirm with certainty that the fabric does not date from the time of Christ. It is, however,equally true that there is nothing that would permit us to state that the manufacture of this fabric was effected in that period.’ Equally true, note. That’s not a strong indication in either direction. ” [Pam Moon] had to bring an English equivalent of a FOIA demand (Freedom of Information Act) to get the photographs from Oxford. Fact is that US and British taxpayers footed a good chunk of the bill for the carbon dating.” The British taxpayer also funded the retrieval of the old records.

There is no evidence for any attachment, and there should be. I said nothing about cotton in my comments above – if the cotton is a straw man, then it is one of your making, not mine. You didn’t really read my comment, did you? “The cotton was part of new fibers used to reweave and repair damaged parts of the Shroud.” I dare say. But how were these ‘new fibres’ attached to the old fibres? That’s what I was discussing above. I’m sorry if it wasn’t clear. The rest of your post is incomprehensible. A crucifix fell on the floor? The cotton was spliced with new fibres? Where does Rogers say this or that? Stop!

Now, Max. “Splicing, glueing and dying are part and parcel of invisible/hidden microrecontructions.” Well, no, they’re not. At least not generally, and nor is there any evidence that any reconstruction technique of the “French invisible reweaving” kind has involved any kind of splicing. Interweaving, certainly, and possibly the twisting together of threads, but not splicing of the kind I described above. As far as I know – and Thibault will probably be able to verify or amend this – only one single piece of thread, and that a weft thread of about 10mm long, has been observed to be made of two separate pieces. The two pieces were not spliced but simply glued together, and could not have had any structural integrity. Furthermore, the two pieces were both found to have been made of cotton, not linen.

Max, what do I make of Villarreal’s ‘splice’, Rogers’s (and others) cotton, and, for that matter, Rogers’s vanillin? Sadly, there is insufficient information or consistency about these findings to make anything of them. Some cotton fibres seem to be present as surface contamination, which could have floated on anytime, and others as integral parts of the thread, which must have been present when the Shroud, or the interpolation, was made. It is not clear that similar contamination cannot be found elsewhere on the shroud. A new thought that has just occurred to me. It is not clear from Rogers’s papers how many of his 14 Raes threads he thought were modern. It is a pity that he did not attempt to quantify his findings.

It was he who identified both ends as being cotton (now discredited) and more tentatively, the adhesive as being terpene. As it stands, little can be adduced from Villarreal’s observations. I do not believe anybody has tried to extend any thread simply by gluing another bit onto the end, and suspect the terpene simply made the fibres brittle so that they snapped at that place, although this is only a suggestion. “The fact is you make NOTHING of all these pieces of evidence!

I’m now looking at “Textile Questions that Remain Following the Carbon Dating Test”, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi2829part4.pdf. Tyrer ponders two contaminants; firstly later organic remains such as “fungi, insect debris and pollens”, and “deposits of smoke from the fire, and hydrocarbons from the vapours of candles”, and “perspiration and greases.” As I described above, this kind of contamination was specifically looked for and removed, and, even if it wasn’t could not possibly have amounted to three quarters of the mass of the sample. He also mentions that contaminants may have been washed in with the water used to put out a fire, without imagining the possibility that they may have been washed out again by the water used to clean the sample. Secondly, he ponders the possibilities of superheated steam at temperatures of 900°C. “Any contaminants on, or embedded in, the fabric structure would be dissolved by this steam and forced into the weave and yarn construction, and would react chemically with the molecular structure of the fibres of the flax.” This is pure guesswork. My guess is that any flax in contact with steam at 900°C would immediately be reduced to ashes. The difference between my guess and Tyrer’s? Well, I’ve put linen into an oven at 350°C, and seen it char to ashes in a very short time. I have no doubt that at 900°C there would be nothing left. What experiments has Tyler carried out? But above all, even if all this steam pressure had contaminated the Shroud – there still wouldn’t be three quarters modern and one quarter old. Over the last few days both OK (authenticist) and I (non authenticist) have come to an agreement regarding the massive amount of contamination required to make a 1st century date appear 14th century. Anybody who thinks any form of contamination such as black or yellow threads of cotton, insect remains or superheated steam pressure has to explain this quantitively rather than qualitatively, or airy dismissals such as John’s above are nothing but head in the sand ostrich posing. Authenticists who claim that the basic linen of the radiocarbon samples is different from that of the rest of the Shroud have at least got the proportion problem solved.

He mentions all he usual suspects, from wax to cigarette ash, without seriously wondering if it could amount to enough contamination to have any serious effect on the radiocarbon date. Wilson says, of the radiocarbon scientists: “Where, in all the hype put out by the AMS scientists in 1988 about ‘astronomical’ odds was there even the slightest word of caution that contamination might have affected the dating result?” and “But surely the radiocarbon dating laboratories would have made some preliminary check of their samples to make sure that no contamination of any kind was present? The straight answer is no.” Is this fair. This is what the Nature paper says: “Because it was not known to what degree dirt, smoke or other contaminants might affect the linen samples, all three laboratories subdivided the samples, and subjected the pieces to several different mechanical and chemical cleaning procedures. All laboratories examined the textile samples microscopically to identify and remove any foreign material.” And this before the paper goes on to list the various procedures carried out. He also, remarkably, dismisses the interweaving theory, which I think is the only route now open to authenticists. However he does put some credence in the bioplastic coating hypothesis, saying that some sample pieces which had been reserved by Riggi could be seen to be contaminated by a microbiological coating in 1994, and that Prof. Mattingly had sent Harry Gove some samples of such contamination to show that even a 60% contamination was invisible. I find all this rather difficult to accept at face value. If the bioplastic coating was evident to the scientists in 1994, then why should it not have been spotted by the radiocarbon labs in 1988, and how could Mattingly could make it invisible when he sent a sample to Gove?

As Guerreschi has shown, the outer two arrows point to waterstains that are not associated with the fire at all. The middle arrow shows how very little water actually penetrated the shroud as a result of the fire. Either way, even the big stain almost completely misses the C14 cut off corner. The other cut off corner does largely coincide with a larger and more diffuse stain (still not associated with the 1532 fire though), but then so do four other areas along that edge of the shroud, none of which show substantial mould or bacterial damage. 2) Garza Valdez’s bacteria. Those who examined the shroud in 1978 think this is vastly overplayed. To me, it is true, those little purple wiggles look like bacteria, but others claim they are no more than microfibres stripped off the fibres themselves. It is clear that even if they exist these bacteria have had little or no effect on the integrity of the cloth, and do not need (and did not need) to be cut away. 3) Terpene and cotton contamination. Pam has confused two separate pieces of research here, which cannot be eaily reconciled. The photo of an alleged piece of intertwined threads of cotton on end and flax the other – and not stuck together with anything – is a different thread from the one examined by Villarreal, where the two pieces were butt joined, not intertwined, both cotton, and stuck together with gum. Given this contradiction, it is obvious that neither of these observations can be considered representative of the radiocarbon area as a whole. 4) The weave pattern. The first photo is the somewhat indistinct one used by Benford and Marino to show that one side of a herringbone ‘spine’ is more irregular than the other, which some textile ‘experts’ agreed may be evidence that the two were not of consistent manufacture. Actually an enlargement of any randomly selected part of the shroud on Shroud 2.0 shows similar irregularities. The second set of pictures does not show the C14 dating sample, or in fact any sample of the shroud at all. Caspar von Uffhofen, from whose work is was taken, says it is an ilustration put together entirely for illustrative purposes by Mssrs Castaldi and Bara. I do not consider that the mouldy corner cut away hypothesis has been established at all. However, I don’t think the wiping of the cloth with a slightly sticky cotton cloth is unlikely. I suggested it a while ago when I first noticed that the Holland backing cloth under the shroud was considerably lighter than the exposed areas, and thought some stain might have been applied on the more visible areas to try to make them less conspicuous.

Comment – oh, dear; I wish you hadn’t asked. We begin with 32 unique or unusual features. Unique compared to what, I ask myself? In what way is a lack of foreign materials or particulates unique? Or a non diffuse image with sharp boundaries? Or a reduction of the cloth’s fluorescence? We are not told. Some of the 32 are generally thought of as descriptions of the image on the shroud, some are highly contentious, and some are literally meaningless (e.g. The shroud lacks two dimensional directionality). We are then told that all these features can only be explained by some form of collimated radiation. From this inauspicious beginning we are taken through an increasingly speculative discussion which, as it depends entirely on the shroud falling through a suddenly dematerialised body, is literally untestable. In spite of being told 48 times what “would” have happened, no evidence at all can be adduced to suggest that any of it actually did happen. Again, much of the discussion makes no scientific sense. It is supposed that the body disintegrates in a burst of radiation, and the cloth then falls vertically through it. Before it starts to drop, the initial radiation affects the cloth in direct proportion to the distance of the cloth from the body. This relies on two assumptions that are not considered – firstly that the same amount of radiation is emitted from all parts of the body, and secondly that it travels vertically from the body. No justification for this is offered at all. Be that as it may, what happens next? We are told that the shroud begins to fall vertically through the body cavity. We are not told what the surrounding air would do. Does it rush into the cavity created by the suddenly disintegrated body, swooshing the cloth with it? If not, why not? Well never mind, let’s suppose the shroud falls uniformly downwards. After a very short time those parts that were in direct contact with the body are now within the body cavity, while those parts that were not are still falling through the air separating them from it. At that point, what is the difference between the radiation affecting the area still in the air, and the radiation affecting the part within the cavity? Does it make any sense to speculate? Well never mind, let’s keep going. Radiation consists of particles or energy going from somewhere to somewhere else. It does not consist of a vacuum “containing a small amount of some basic particles of matter such as protons, neutrons and perhaps electrons and gamma rays.” We must surely suppose that all these particles are moving fantastically fast. In which direction are they going? Surely they are shooting outwards from where they come from in all directions. In which case they will destroy the collimation we were hoping to achieve by the shroud dropping vertically through them. And so it goes.

However, one piece of research seems to have closed the issue of its authenticity conclusively. In 1988 the results of radiocarbon dating of fibres from the Shroud were announced, seemingly pinning the origin of the cloth to between 1260 and 1390. Place this information alongside other pieces of evidence, such as a memorandum to the Pope from Bishop d’Arcis of Troyes c. 1389 in which he claimed to be aware of the artist who had faked the Shroud and that it was ‘cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed’, and the argument for the Shroud being a fake is quite convincingly made. … One might have thought that straightforward physical analysis of the cloth would be sufficient to distinguish between a painting and an image produced in some manner by physical contact with a body. Unfortunately, almost every single point made by a scientist, with an established reputation in a relevant field, concerning the image on the Shroud has been contested by an equally reputable scientist with a different point of view. The fact that scientists disagree, and often disagree vehemently, should be a matter brought to the attention of students of all ages. … There have been many attempts to simulate the image on the Turin Shroud, including a painting being impressed onto a cloth in a manner similar to a brass rubbing. A judgment of success can only be subjective, but to date no reproduction has been able to produce the 3 D nature of the image with the level of detail in negative! With our 21st century technological sophistication, we are so far defeated.” A couple of years ago David Rolfe was on the hunt for teachers who used the shroud, with the idea of putting together a ‘teaching pack’ that might be made available.

There is a lot of good scientific and historical evidence for authenticity, but if it comes in a package with this nonsense it is hardly surprising that Jerry Coyne, Joe Nickell and other critics regard the whole case for authenticity with contempt. With friends like these, as I said yesterday, who needs enemies? As usual Stephen’s basic axiom is that the shroud is genuine. Given that premise as indisputable, it would indeed be surprising that a randomly incorrect radiocarbon age would match the date when the shroud is first mentioned historically. However, in logic, the more improbable a corollary, the less sound is the axiom upon which it depends, and Stephen’s own incredulity actually forces a reconsideration of his basic premise as much as it does an expanation of the corollary. Be that as it may, he quotes the unlikeliness of the radiocarbon date matching the historical date as “one in a thousand trillion.” This comes from Harry Gove’s book where it is thrown in at the end of the book with no explanation. It’s nonsense of course. If there is no C 14 in a sample at all, it cannot be dated as older than about a hundred thousand years, and if it contains more C 14 than there is in the atmosphere, it cannot be dated, obviously, to a time in the future. Consequently even if a wholly random date was derived from radiocarbon dating, it would have a one in a hundred thousand chance of being correct. This is ten billion times more likely than Gove’s probability! If a range of a hundred years were acceptable, then the probability that a wholly random C 14 date was co incidentally correct becomes one in a thousand. Still, one in a thousand is pretty unlikely, which is why the 1350 date cannot be dismissed as random, nor, because it conflicts with Stephen’s axiom, can it be dismissed “out of hand.” If it is wrong, it is wrong for a reason.

I do not dispute that some evidence implying contamination has been found, and that it casts doubt on the radiocarbon date, but it is insufficiently consistent to refute it absolutely.

The short answer is that nobody has yet shown that such a mechanism exists. The Oxford laboratory tried with CO and failed, and charcoal particles created under all sorts of conditions are frequently dated successfully. Given that the Shroud was supposedly stored in a silver casket, the principal, if not the only source of carbon atoms was, of course, the Shroud itself, which would not skew its date. Similarly, unless the shroud was covered in photosynthetic bacteria, and therefore green, the carbon content of any bioplastic coating would be made from the Shroud’s own carbon, and therefore date to the same time. Hypotheses using neutron flux currently belong to “miracle science” which is not amenable to rational investigation. 2) Was the sample area representative of the original whole cloth? This, of course, has been examined exhaustively without achieving consensus. The overriding consideration for me has been the sheer quantity of contamination required to achieve a date adjustment of over a thousand years. The different proportions worked out by scientists relate to the type of contamination, ie what mass of C14 atoms should be added, or what mass of carbon, or what mass of organic material such as thread. Unless black bits of carbon can be identified on the shroud, the contamination is normally supposed to be interpolated thread, in which case two thirds of the sample would consist of contamination, and one third original. I do not accept that any of the evidence put forward to support this argument is sufficiently strong to refute the 13th century date. 3) Radiocarbon dating is often just wrong. I consider this a very weak argument. Had the Shroud dated to the 1st century and anybody dared to put it forward, they would have been considered to be grasping at the feeblest of straws to discredit the date. The same applies here. Radiocarbon dating is never “just wrong.” It is wrong for a number of possible reasons, such as contamination from groundwater, or a marine or terrestrial, rather than an atmospheric, source of the carbon under examination. These reasons can be investigated, but often aren’t, usually because the C14 tests are expensive and the results were only confirmatory anyway. Where they are repeated, the reason for the anomaly is easily found. In the case of the Shroud the Tucson labs have sufficient material to redo the tests. Finally, however, I agree with Marinelli’s conclusion. The Shroud cannot be definitively dated to the middle of the fourteenth century (actually I consider the end of the thirteenth more likely), and there is certainly evidence to the contrary. I do not consider it strong enough to refute the labs’ conclusions; others do. That’s OK.

It is mostly about the proportion of cotton which may have been included within the threads of the shroud, and I’m afraid is riddled with inconsistencies. I agree that the difference between cotton and linen fibres cannot be detected by the naked eye, and has to be determined microscopically. This could have been done by those who examined the sticky tape samples of Frei or the STURP team, by Gilbert Raes (and those who used his sample), and the C14 dating teams (or anyone who had access to their sample). It seems that everybody who has done this has identified cotton fibres among the flax. The question is – how much is there? Giulio Fanti (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/fantir7appendix.pdf) reckons that a fibre taken from the C14 sample area contained about 2% cotton. Thibault Heimberger (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibaultr7part3.pdf) reckons that a fibre taken from the Raes sample is about 15% cotton. Roberto Villarreal (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf) says that of his Raes thread “cotton was a major constituent.” Elsewhere Robert Villarrealo (http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm) says both ends of a ‘spliced’ thread were “definitely cotton and not linen (flax).” Now this simply won’t do. Even if there were a 16th century patch, the possibility that it was made from a variety of different threads containing between 2% and 100% cotton is utterly absurd. Now I’m sorry if I seem to burden you, but unless this discrepancy can be explained satisfactorily, the entire question of the relevance of the cotton, and by extension the theory of medieval interweaving, is thrown into disrepute.

If so, I still cannot accept that there would be sufficient contamination for the date to be shifted by the required 1300 years.

Mine is from the molecular weight of cellulose. Another composition of linen yarn is in The Mysteries of the Shroud by Caspar von Uffhofen (on Google Books). He gives “64 to 74% cellulose, 11 to 17% hemicellulose, 1.8% pectin, 2 to 3% lignin, by 1.5% wax and 8 to 10% water.” The proportion of carbon doesn’t change much. In practice, materials are always dried thoroughly specifically to exclude any variable water content before weighing. I’m not surprised that a (more or less) hydrocarbon such as wax contains a great deal more carbon than a carbohydrate such as cellulose, but as you have calculated, there would still have to be a substantial amount of it to skew the carbon dating appropriately. The sizes and masses of the samples are relatively easy to assess. From Barrie’s photos and the various diagrams and measurements (inconsistent though they be) you can find on the web. Sadly, as we have discussed before, the Shroud itself has never been weighed, and all assessments of its mass are derived from rather abstruse measurements of the relative thicknesses of the shroud with its backing and general statements about the average weight of linen and/or Holland cloth. However, I have been very surprised recently to discover quite how heavy a 25mg/cm2 cloth actually is. It’s very thick indeed, more like thin canvas than sheeting.

Many are published by quite small laboratories, or universities or other institutions with the purpose of publishing their own work. They get set up by perfectly respectable honest people, and articles submitted to them get reviewed, mostly, by members of the same institution, who are more anxious than most not to discredit themselves. Some fields of research are so specialised that there are only a few people with the technical knowledge to review a new paper sensibly, and all the papers are circulated around the same small group, who may be colleagues. This is not dishonest, although obviously it is open to outside suspicion if something extraordinary gets through. The rest of us should examine all papers, peer reviewed or not, on their premises and their conclusions for ourselves, and not assume that being peer reviewed is an automatic guarantee of truth.

However, it still is not perfectly clear to me where his diagram came from. Mark Oxley (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf) reproduces two diagrams from Riggi (one crossed out). Both, however, show the masses of the cut out sections, from the end of the cloth, as 52.8, 52.0, 39.6, 14.2 mg. In other words the two smallest pieces are side by side. In every subsequent drawing, such as in the Walsh paper, the two smallest pieces are separated from each other by the other two carbon dating pieces. This is significant. Donahue (in his letter to de Cointet – https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/donahue.jpg) says that the Arizona pieces were cut into four subsamples of 13.86, 12.39, 14.27, 11.63 mg (though the last two figures have been amended by de Cointet). If Arizona received the two smallest pieces of the four, these masses must include the 14.2mg sliver. If Jull retained the 12.39mg piece, then Arizona could only have tested three pieces. This is in contradiction of the Nature report, which shows results for four pieces. Walsh does not appear to notice this. De Cointet’s amendment to Donahue’s diagram – which he justifies by claiming Donahue wrote to him again – makes the total of the four pieces add up to 52.8mg. By luck or design, this is the same weight as the piece of carbon dating material furthest away from the sliver, according to Riggi’s diagram. I think de Cointet is trying to suggest that Arizona got one piece from either end of the four sample strip, the 52.8mg piece and the 14.2mg piece, and I think he is doing it to reconcile the fact that Arizona claim to have had five subsamples, four for testing and one for Jull. But he forgets that this means that either Oxford or Zurich must have ended up with the 39.6g piece, which is incorrect.

I have done many experiments myself to confirm this. When linen is heated at a range of different temperatures it invariably produces bright fluorescence even before any mark is clearly visible by ordinary light. At increasing temperatures the linen turns yellow, but without inhibiting the fluorescence, and then brown, when it stops, although the burns still have a bright fluorescent border. My earlier experiments were based on over contrasty photos of the Shroud: I heated my linen till it went brown, and sure enough the brown areas did not fluoresce, and I thought the image could therefore be a scorch. When I realised that the image was actually yellow, and therefore equivalent to a lower temperature, fluorescence producing heat, I realised that some other mechanism than simple scorching must be involved, hence my further concentration on chemical rather than thermal degradation of the surface of the linen. There are, however, reasonable objections to claiming that modern experiments disprove the burn hypothesis. For a start, the whole shroud fluoresces quite brightly, even in places where there is neither scorch nor image, and it could be that whatever produced the image inhibited, rather than enhanced this background fluorescence, producing the UV image we see today.

Among my pursuits is that of amateur actor.. I suppose by my own values I ought simply to chuckle tolerantly and move on, but, as Thomas More points out in ‘A Man For All Seasons,’ “Qui tacet consentire” so I fear it behoves me to reply to Stephen’s comments. From the top: 1) Actually, from revisiting the radiocarbon dates, I am increasingly inclined towards a late 13th century date for the Shroud. It’s to do with the kink in the calibration curve that occurs between about 1325 and 1375, and will be further explored in the next Newsletter. 2) By “accidentally,” an adverb which has already caused much hilarity in authenticist circles, I do not mean that the image appeared as fortuitously as it has on pieces of toast, pizzas and so on. I think that the image we see now is the inadvertent result of some other intention, not a deliberate attempt to produce the very vague, superficial, scorch like appearance it has now. Perhaps along the lines of an epitaphios, altar cloth, reredos, or simple object of devotion rather than a deliberate fraud, and the original principle medium has disappeared, leaving what we have now. As to what this medium might have been, I agree that the non authenticists are no nearer confirming that than the authenticists are with their radiation or vapour hypotheses. 3) Is it petty of me not to like Stephen’s term ‘anti authenticist’? It implies an antagonism towards ‘authenticists’ which I simply don’t feel. Although there are extremists on both sides of the debate, I feel that most of the commenters here are respectful of all the evidence for and against, and their convictions one way or the other do not prevent them from admitting that there are objections to them which have not been decisively refuted. 4) I did not know that Stephen had helped put all the early BSTS Newsletters online as well as the ongoing Shroud Spectrum project. Regardless of his views, this is a tedious and time consuming job which has produced the most enormous benefit to Shroud researchers and will continue to do so as long as the internet exists. I have no hesitation whatever in thanking him sincerely for his achievement. 5) Stephen denies that he thinks the Shroud is “incontrovertibly authentic” (my words), although he has also claimed that the evidence in favour of it is so “overwhelming” that anyone, including the Catholic Church, who does not accept it is under Satanic influence. “If the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!” (October 2013, quoted without permission). I stand by my statement. 6) I say Stephen discourages comments. He says he only discourages comments which are off topic, offensive, sub standard, interminable, time wasting, getting nowhere or debating. I stand by my statement. 7) Stephen re iterates his misunderstanding of Harry Gove’s statistical statement about astronomical odds, and again misapplies his misinterpretation to the inverse of its meaning. I have discussed this in detail elsewhere. The rest of his post is a re iteration of his hacking ideas which need not concern us until he produces rather more than the loosest of circumstantial evidence..","date":"2014-08-13","mins":"9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter"},{"id":"comment-144664","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Colin has called two things “nuts.” One is the belief that it is impossible to scorch only one side of a linen thread, and the other is the belief that a knowledge of the precise physics and chemistry of a procedure is necessary in order to produce an intended effect.

He has already attempted to sway the jury by misrepresenting Robert Hedges, one of the radiocarbon scientists. It was the opinion of the radiocarbon team that it would be so improbable for extra neutron radiation to have given a 1st century cloth exactly the date proposed by the forgery hypothesis by chance that the idea could be effectively discounted, and it was much more likely that the Shroud was, in fact, datable to the time they dertermined. Jones, blithely assuming an incontrovertible 1st century date, uses this statement to mean that, since the probability of producing a 13th century date by chance was discountable, it must have been produced deliberately. He has ignored the fact that the radiocarbon scientists were referring specifically to random neutron radiation as the cause of the discrepancy, and implies that no process at all could result in a 13th century date by chance. In saying this he ignores the work of Benford, Marino, Rogers, Villarreal and Brown, all of whom have demonstrated that interpolated weaving could have produced a 13th century date entirely fortuitously. De Wesselow is quoted as making a similar argument: “If the carbon dating error was accidental, then it is a remarkable coincidence that the result tallies so well with the date always claimed by sceptics as the Shroud’s historical debut.” But this is only one half of an opinion. The other half says: “If the carbon dating was accurate, then it is no coincidence at all that it tallies perfectly with the first known accounts of the Shroud’s appearance.” Jones finds a 1st century provenance for the Shroud “overwhelming.” I, on the other hand, do not. However, even if it were, in fact even if it were proved, that would not of itself be evidence of fraudulent radiocarbon dating. I have no doubt that Jones will quote Harry Gove and Emanuela Marinelli at length, as they detail any amount of clumsiness, miscommunication and irregularity over the taking of the radiocarbon sample, none of which I dispute. And none of which is fraud.

You are correct that no mathematical answer can be found to vaguely generalised premises, but words like astronomical and miraculous imply that even with the little data we have, some estimate of the probability can be made, and that it would be staggeringly unlikely. Neither you nor I like that kind of “plucking from the air,” so I set myself a very specific question, with clearly calculable answers. 1) The shroud was made in 25 AD. Shortly before the crucifixion. I could have meandered around between 10 AD and 33 AD, but lets stick to 25 AD. A material made in 25 AD contains 78.70% of its original C14. 2) The contamination was made in 1535. I could have picked a later date, but I chose just after the fire. If there was some reweaving, it must have been at some time, and the exact date is, as it happens, irrelevant. Material from 1535 contains 96.44% of its original C14. 3) The ‘target’ date. Between 1260 and 1390. As given in the Nature paper. A material from 1260 contains 91.0% of its C14, and a material from 1390 contains 92.77%. 4) Pick a random percentage between 0 and 100. If there was between 0 and 70% of contamination, the resultant date would be too old to amaze Stephen with its uncanny accuracy. If there was between 80 and 100% the resultant date would be too young. That leaves a range of between 70% and 80% which would produce the ‘astronomically unlikely figure’ given by the Nature paper. That’s about 10% of the possible random selections, or 1 in 10. This answer is not plucked from the air or thrown to the wind. The heterogeneity of the sample is irrelevant in this context, as the date of any sample is from the whole sample, whether the new and old threads were neatly separated or intricately blended makes no difference. Neither we, nor Jones, are talking about the whole shroud here. He cannot accept that the Nature dates are achievable by chance, which is the whole basis of his conspiracy theory. Actually they are. Incidentally, as long as the contamination was between about 1500 and 1900, it doesn’t even matter if we don’t know what date it was from. If I rephrased my question as follows: “What is the probability that a random percentage of cloth, from a random year between 1500 and 1900, added to a cloth made in 25 AD, could result in a radiocarbon date of between 1260 and 1390?” the answer is still about 1 in 10. I simply can do the math, and so can anybody else. Dan is perfectly correct that to that extent, Sue and Joe’s contamination hypothesis is more probable than it may previously have appeared – although there does have to be an awful lot of it..","date":"2014-05-29","mins":"1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/29/the-challenge-for-stephen-now/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Challenge for Stephen Now"},{"id":"comment-125524","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Note that all my dates are calendar dates, not BP (Before Present) dates as produced by the raw calculations from C14 decay.

Shroud.com lists 33 members of STURP, of whom 26 went to Turin in 1978. Some are virtually unknown (What did Rudolph Dichtl, Donald Janney, John German or Thomas Haverty actually do in Turin?), and the vast majority, having produced their report, do not seem to have involved themselves in the subject further. Joseph Accetta and Eric Jumper think the Shroud is medieval (although Jumper is reported as wavering on this recently), while Jackson, Bucklin, Rogers and Schwortz are/were on the side of authenticity.

All his experiments were microscopical and chemical, and all carried out on the Raes and radiocarbon sample fibres he had at the time.

There are several things a little awry with your comment above, which need to be untangled. Firstly, you’re correct that a flat denial is a dogma rather than a conclusion, but the evidence you were asking for has been explored in considerable detail on this sight, so Dan’s denial should be seen in that light. The fact that “there seems no convincing explanation” for the 13th century date cuts little ice with the people who think that the Shroud does, in fact, date from the 13th century, and even those who think it genuine have come up with a number of more convincing ideas than a Soviet plot. You ask: Why have all free existing pieces of the shroud been confiscated shortly after the results have been proclaimed and any new carbon dating strictly forbidden? Well there are certainly two pieces of the C14 sample which are still in the possession of the Tucson Lab, and any number of threads and fibres owned by the Whangers, and several others with access to Riggi and Gonella’s various hooverings. They have not been confiscated and as far as I know, nobody has been forbidden to carry out a test on those pieces. The most obvious reason for not wanting a further test on the actual Shroud is that the Church thinks the results will not, however carefully carried out, decide the matter one way or another, and so would simply be a waste of a precious relic, but why might the Church not want a reliable testing of the remaining Tucson pieces (which were, it must be remembered, retained specifically for just such a purpose). What are the alternatives? a) The Church knows the Shroud is medieval and does not want it confirmed? b) The Church knows the Shroud is ancient and does not want it confirmed? c) The Church thinks the Shroud is medieval and does not want its antiquity proved? d) The Church thinks the Shroud is ancient and does not want its modernity proved?

Giulio Fanti admits that his dating methods are only accurate to plus or minus hundreds of years. You mention the weird, unverified, undocumented caim that a secret test was made of an unauthorised, unverified thread by a scientist improperly making use of an AMS machine out of hours, mysteriously coming up with two dates, 800 years apart, with an average of 600 AD.

If you believe that the different colours on the quad photos represent different materials, then you must believe that the wide blue bands across three of the photos represent a different material from the orangy yellow field, and that the dark green corners on all four photos represent another, and that the deep pinky red area of the dorsal legs represents yet another. This is absurd. The similarity between the colour distortions on all four photos suggests that they are due to the similar way each photo was lit, and nothing to do with the composition of the cloth. John, I read the quotation entirely accurately the first time, thank you, and believe that the ‘darning’ referred to by Delorenzi was that of the repairs to the burn holes, and not to anywhere else. It is apparent from the clumsiness of the patching, and the fact that extra patches of a different material were added to the original ones, and the black stitching that used to be easy to see which was always used by Sebastian Valfré, that several hands, at several different times, contributed to these repairs. As I explained above, anybody today can examine the Shroud more closely than Delorenzi could, simply by looking at Shroud 2.0, and I challenge anybody to find any evidence of any mending anywhere other than in the areas of the burn holes, where the stitch holes from the patches are still evident. In what sense is my argument uninformed? Would you care to inform it? In what sense is my argument disingenuous?

(http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerppt.pdf) 2) Because he said so. 3) No. 4) From examination of photographs. 5) No. (Five questions…) A bit of elaboration though. I am not in favour of accusing anybody of fraud without very good reason to do so, and the fact that I disagree with their findings is not a good reason. People do make mistakes, and it is possible that the threads Rogers received from Gonella were misattributed, but again, simply disagreeing with conclusions is not not evidence for such misattribution. If Mc Crone shows me a slide covered in red dots he calls iron oxide, or Max Frei shows me a slide of a pollen grain he calls Prunus arabica, then I assume that the dots do look like iron oxide, and the grain looks like Prunus arabica, unless somebody can show me that they don’t. I may think that the dots are actually something else similar, or that the pollen grain looks like dozens of similar species, but I do not doubt that the scientists made their identifications in good faith. Naive of me, perhaps, but once you start accusing people of fraud, where can you stop, and why should you have any credibility yourself? The answers to the first two questions, then, are not, to mind, evidence that Rogers did not, in fact, examine fibres from the Shroud. The second two, however, raise corollaries. The photo of a fragment of the radiocarbon sample sent to Thomas Ferguson, David Pearson, Louis Harner and was not very clear. I do not know what else Benford and Marino asked these experts, or what other information they were given. Thomas Ferguson was non committal – the right hand side may have been ” “touched up to prevent unraveling”. David Pearson was more positive: “there is no question that there is different material on each side… It is definitely a patch.” This, of course, was in the days when Benford and Marino assumed that each radiocarbon piece was dated as a whole, and that the date of the piece reflected the proportions of the two materials. Actually, this piece was cut into five, and if Pearson was correct, some dates would have been all 1st century, some dates would have been 16th or 17th century, and only where the materials merged would the 14th century, mixed, date have been found. That this did not happen is evidence that Pearson was quite simply completely wrong. He also said that “medieval European weavers would … hand stitch approximately ½ inch of new material into the old, such that it was invisible to all but the trained eye.” This half inch of blended threads is not visible at all to any eye, which suggests that it isn’t there. Louis Harmer said “the float is different on either side of the sample.” It is not clear to me if he was making the same mistake as Pearson. It is interesting that a second set of photos – from the Oxford sample this time – has been sent to Thomas Ferguson, and reported on in detail by Donna Campbell. Her comments are considerably more circumspect. “There are signs in the Shroud sample that direct the notion of mending or reweaving of the actual woven fabric.” Directing a notion is hardly a ringing endorsement. (http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud of Turin exhibition/Home files/Updated report on the Consideration to the Uniformity and Effects of the Fabric in the Shroud of Turin 5 1.pdf) Finally, nobody has refuted Flury Lemberg’s insistence that “invisible mending” is not invisible. This has become something of an impasse. Devotees insist that there is a style of mending which is completely invisible even under a microscope. The fact that it cannot be seen just shows how invisible it is. They point to French Reweaving, the Frenway Method or Invisible Mending, all of which are commercially available, as evidence that mending can be invisible, but they’re wrong. No actual invisible mender is so foolish as to claim that his mend is actually invisible, even under a microscope. Indeed, as Flury Lemberg humourously pointed out, how could you see what you were doing if your work disappeared in front of your eyes! The last resort of the invisible mending faction is to claim that it was carried out in a style since lost to us. So not only is the invisible mending itself invisible, but so is the invisible mending technique!.","date":"2015-11-22","mins":"9:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-215008","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I also agree with Daveb.

Whether this was applied with a paint brush, or by placing the cloth over a smeared bas relief, or some other method I can’t really say. Of course there are objections to this hypothesis, which many people, including myself, give some weight to, but at the moment I do not find them sufficiently cogent to persuade me of the Shroud’s authenticity. Thibault Heimburger’s paper, https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/thibault lg.pdf, examines what Garlaschelli actually produced and makes good observations about their failings even while admitting that they are the best artificial versions so far. I think there is certainly more to be done, but if Garlaschelli could be bothered to take Thibault’s objections to heart and make appropriate modifications, I think a more acceptable fac simile is far from improbable. I do not reject an ‘unscientific miracle’ out of hand – just there’s nothing to be investigated if that’s how it was done – but I do not find any of the ‘scientific miracles’ at all convincing, be they of mysterious emanations of cadaverine, ammonia, neutrons, electrons, electromagnetic radiation or whatever.

I find no evidence of any reweaving in any photographs that I have seen; the only expert to declare that there was definitely a patch is demonstrably wrong, and two close examiners of the whole cloth have also seen no reweaving.
