The three dates quoted refer to the three basic methods of investigation; thus 300 BC for the FT IR, 200 BC for Raman, and 400 AD for the mechanical. Rinaldi’s whole critique is based on the fact that shroud fragments sucked out with a vacuum cleaner are likely to be more degraded, and thus give an apparently older age for the shroud than it really is. However he does not say what Fanti’s mechanical tests were (and the press released mentioned “a set of mechanical parameters”) or how they were calibrated to achieve the single date; and he (Rinaldi) does not discuss the spectrographic results at all, which presumably postulate chemical rather than physical degradation. Given the almost universal derision which Fanti’s book has received, I fear the chances of it being published in English are getting remoter by the minute, which I think is a pity.

On my laptop (Macbook Pro), this only occurs if I hold the screen in ‘landscape’ format, and not when I hold it sideways in ‘portrait’ format. I suppose it is something to do with the way the liquid crystal display units are arranged. Although a solarization has many of the characteristics of a negative, it isn’t, nor is it anything to do with infra red radiation, as suggested on Vicenzo’s website. Almost nothing in Vincenzo’s article above is true. Angular Filming does not act as a negative/positive inverter, it does not enhance detail, nor allow for close up magnification. It is a very poor filter system. Angular filming does not work in segments, it depends entirely on the angle between the screen and the camera, although, as a camera is more precise than the human eye, you do need several positions to take photos of the whole screen. The Wikipedia image is not the best image of the Vatican Veronica on the internet. Try http://www.holyfacedevotion.com/images/Veronica Veil.jpg. As for the similarity between the faces of the Shroud and the Vatican veil, you don’t need to squint at a badly focussed solarisation of either to observe them. Just superimpose the two on a document. Hardly surprisingly, the eyes, nose and mouth can be fairly accurately superimposed on one another – but then that’s true of just about every other portrait on the planet. I do not see any other correlation, specifically no injury marks on the cheeks. The conclusion that the Veronica will authenticate the Shroud of Turin and vice versa is extremely far fetched, in my opinion.

I agree that the the finel version of the papal bull was much less antagonistic towards the shroud, and by implication its owner than the previous ones. I’m afraid I cannot go along with your suggestion that the phrase ‘omne fraude cessante’ can be reduced to a formulaic expression of general good faith, but do agree that the second part of the sentence (ut tanquam…) is indeed couched in somewhat legalistic jargon (especially with all those predictam, dicti and diciturs!). So did Antipope Clement think the Shroud was authentic or not? I think he had no idea. While any bit of bone or cloth might be considered a genuine relic in its local environment, partly out of loyalty to its area and partly for lack of anything else to compare it to, the hierarchy in the Vatican (or Avignon in this case) must have realised that there were dozens of conflicting, and sometimes impossible, relics scattered around Europe, many or most of which could not be authentic, and were at best pious representations and at worst deliberate frauds. I do not think consideration for the irregularities of the Fourth Crusade were much of a consideration; at the time these things were considered ‘rescued’ rather than ‘robbed’ I think, but the seniority of the place where the relic was displayed may have played a part in making a decision. A humble parish priest suddenly announcing he had a nail from the cross could have been denounced out of hand, while a bishop might have been accorded considerably more respect. A conflict of interests between two important men over the Shroud had to be handled very delicately. Various middle paths were possible: the shroud was authentic, but couldn’t be displayed; the shroud was not authentic, but could be displayed; or the pope didn’t know whether it was authentic or not. The last, ignorance, would have shown a hierarchical weakness an antipope would have wanted to avoid, and the first would have rendered the relic useless (practical things, relics). The second, I think, was the best compromise the pope could come up with. Two questions arise; why would one grant an indulgence to someone who visited a painting? and why was the bishop enjoined to perpetual silence on the matter? The first is easy. An act of veneration is made to God, not to an artifact, miraculous or not, and indulgence is granted to a person, not a thing. The visiting of a holy place, whether or not it contained a relic, could be considered sufficient devotion for an indulgence to be awarded. The second is less easy. My guess is that, being personally hostile to the de Charney family, d’Arcis had another go at the Pope, who now felt that his authority was being attacked and who felt that he had already made as good a compromise as necessary. As to whether the Shroud is really authentic or not, I don’t think any of this correspondence sheds any light on the matter at all!.","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"6:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty"},{"id":"comment-165166","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Goodness me!

Absolutely nothing at all. Not a smidgin. Not even a vague outline of your experiments, your sources, anything at all that might help us follow your reasoning. That being so, we cannot agree or disagree with you. Maybe everything you say is possible, and maybe it isn’t, but if your only authority is yourself, with your ‘most likely’ this and your ‘shall I endlessly repeat’ that, then you can hardly be surprised if we just read it and pass on. So why not redress the balance, just a little? If you have carried out any experiments, tell us what you did and what you observed; if you have documentary sources, quote chapter and verse. It doesn’t have to be the whole nine yards; just choose a detail – why do you think 1st century bodies were covered with ‘gelatinised starch,’ for instance, or what makes you think the burial was ‘fumigated’?

Suppose I were to suggest that none of the conditions you describe were likely to have been present at the burial of Christ, and that even if they were, they would not have had the effect of producing an image. Suppose I did that, what would be your response? Would it be a list of sources showing that you are in fact correct, or would you simply call me an idiot for not believing you? Why should I? Later, you do give two references: 2 Chronicles 16:14. “They buried him in the tomb that he had cut for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that had been filled with various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumer’s art, and they made a very great fire in his honour.” That’s it? That’s a source for all your detailed descriptions of the wrappings and smearings and fumigations? Well, it’s not good enough, Max. It is a basis for an imaginative reconstruction, not a source for a factual one. And then there’s: Ket. 8b; M. Ḳ. 27b. “At first the carrying out of the dead was harder for his relatives than his death, so that they left him and ran away, until Rabban Gamaliel came and adopted a simple style and they carried him out in garments of linen, and [then] all the people followed his example and carried out [the dead] in garments of linen. Said R. Papa: And now it is the general practice [to carry out the dead] even in rough cloth worth [only] a zuz.” What does this tell us about Jesus’s burial? That he must have been buried in elaborate wrappings? Surely not, because you also say that in ancient practice, either “comely” or “rich” shrouds were used. So, no, Max, don’t go on and on about how badly you are misrepresented. Don’t “repeat endlessly,” don’t say “most probably” or tell us what you think Jewish burial practices were.

But what of the opening paragraph? We learn that Robert Drews thinks Gnostics created the Shroud. We learn that Thomas de Wesselow thinks the Shroud to be a natural formation. We learn that many people think the Shroud is authentic. These ideas are not expanded upon or explored in any way, except with the statement: “images are always created by human beings and no one has been able to explain how a corpse could produce such a detailed blood stained image on that large piece of linen.” The first part is patently untrue and the second, an argument from ignorance. I have devoted several posts to explaining that “no one knows how it was done” is not an argument against a 13th century origin, but it is equally not an argument against authenticity either. The opening paragraph ends with the intriguing suggestion that “the authors, by the way, are using the authenticity of the Shroud to give an historical explanation for the Resurrection of Jesus.” The authors in question are not specified, and the Resurrection is not further mentioned in the paper.

There can be a wide discrepancy between the two. In detail: “My paper says that the TS is a fake because that explains how the image got there.” Actually your paper says no such thing. Your sole contribution to ‘how the image got there’ is “images are always created by human beings and no one has been able to explain how a corpse could produce such a detailed blood stained image on that large piece of linen,” which I have already commented on above. “The reviewer is saying there is a “stockpile” of evidence for authenticity. This is pseudoscience because there is no evidence for authenticity.” In the absence of common consensus, evidence may be brought forward to defend either interpretation of the Shroud, and there is indeed sufficient evidence for authenticity for the term ‘stockpile’ to be valid (if somewhat bizarre). Even if there were not, the statement would simply be false; it is not pseudoscience. And should the Shroud ever be definitively determined to be a fake, then the contrary evidence will still exist; it will just have to be re interpreted. “The reviewer then goes on to assume that the TS is authentic and indicates that this is evidence for the “resurrection of Jesus” because the TS was not destroyed.” No, he doesn’t. He specifically conditionally says “provided the [authenticity hypothesis] is assumed,” then there is a priori evidence that the Shroud’s occupant did not lie in it for very long, which is evidence – not very strong, but evidence nonetheless – for the Resurrection. “It is obvious to me that the reviewer is practicing pseudoscience to promote belief in life after death.” What is obvious to you is not necessarily what is obvious to anybody else. It may well be that the reviewer believes that the Shroud is real evidence for the Resurrection, but he is careful not to say that, and one should not assume unstated beliefs. Even if he does believe it, you cannot demonstrate that his belief derives from the practice of pseudoscience. Your subsequent comment on ID is wholly irrelevant. Next you quote a passage from the reviewer without comment. Why? If I may paraphrase it: “What caused the Big Bang … is no concern of this forum unless the investigation is … focused on tentatively proving whether the TS is a fake or not.” Your vague reference to the Big Bang had no relevance to the Shroud at all. “My paper fits into one of the “aspects” listed in the request for papers.” No, it doesn’t.

There is a long and worthy tradition of “what if” speculation, in science and in various other disciplines, in which the axioms upon which a hypothesis is based are not all rooted either in observation or logic. What if animals could talk? What if Napoleon had succeeded in invaded Britain, or Japan had never attacked Pearl Harbour? What if light travelled at the same speed as sound? Scientists and historians have enjoyed developing interesting and sometimes useful scenarios based on these ideas, knowing full well that the premises were wholly unsubstantiated. One of Jackson’s axioms is that a body can become instantaneously mechanically transparent. From that, and the rest of his postulates, Jackson has built a reasonable scenario which, according to his ‘new physics’, could produce an image exactly as seen on the Shroud. The scenario is controversial. To suggest that the axioms upon which it is based are controversial – is silly. Even Jackson knows very well that there is no known physics on which such a predicate could be based, although he desperately hopes that, simply because science has occasionally been wrong before, something may turn up to justify it eventually. “As a physicist, I admit to having my own difficulties with this concept … [but] … I would like to ask the reader to put aside, for the moment, any reservations he or she might have concerning the “unconventional” nature of this concept and consider it merely as a hypothesis to be evaluated critically using the well established principles of the Scientific Method.” Well, fair enough..","date":"2015-11-18","mins":"9:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-139180","author":"hugh_farey","post":"“How can we possibly understand how a singularity produced 100 billion galaxies?” Some find it a problem, but physicists such as myself and many others have no intellectual difficulty, although it is an emotional enormity, I admit. “The Big Bang is evidence that God does not exist.” No it isn’t.

No one could look at the Manopello image, with its somewhat grotesque teeth, or the slicked back hair and sleek moustache of the Pantocrator, and say, ‘he looks like the man on the Shroud.’ I do not consider the mathematical similarity more important than the overall artistic one. 2) When I match up a couple of photos, I do not use the size of the head. It is impossible to gauge the size of the Shroud man’s head as his beard obscures his chin. What I do is to adjust one picture (without changing the aspect) so that the level of the eyes and the level of the mouth match, as I have in my picture above. When that is done almost any picture of anybody blends quite well, including Prince William. 3) Your own matches of the Manopello and Pantocrator images do not match mouths well. For the Manopello image, we have to assume that what is normally taken as the lower lip of the Shroud man is actually the teeth of the Manopello man, while the lower lip of the Pantocrator image is actually the moustache of the Shroud man. Comparing the Manopello image with the Pantocrator image, following your own video, shows the mouths of the two are widely discrepant. 4) At 4:08 we are told “there is no way your going to get all these match points by random happenstance” and at 4:20 we get “the calculated odds of probability and chance that all these 180 points of congruency between the Shroud of Turin and this image [the Pantocrator] are a coincidental match … are 1 in several million at least.” Actually the video shows almost no points of congruency, let alone 180. You would have to point them out individually before anybody could accept any such thing. How did you count them? Simply lining up the eyes does not show 180 points of congruency. 5) There is also a claim (at 1:35) that the Manopello image must have been laid against the Shroud image for the match to be so perfect. However resizing photographs to fit each other does not support any such claim. To do that you would have to produce actual measurements of similar features of the two images, which has not been done, either here or, I believe, anywhere else. All in all, its an entertaining game, this image blending demonstration, but it tells us nothing at all about the origins of the various images, let alone constitutes any kind of ‘proof.’.","date":"2015-03-26","mins":"3:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"id":"comment-23044","author":"hugh_farey","post":"So… Article I.1.0 The front and back images are equally dark.

I do not doubt Dayvault’s sincerity. However I have a couple of serious objections to the ENCODED article. Firstly, I do wish the word ‘forensic’ didn’t keep cropping up. I have no doubt at all – does anyone else? Does Dayvault? – that a court of law (which is where forensic methods get tested) would have extreme difficulty in recognising, beyond all reasonable doubt, that either the Sanliurfa mosaic or the Cistine Chapel were copies of the shroud. The forensic methods of a fingerprint expert, for example, or those of a firearms/toolmarks unit, in which Dayvault gained his expertise, are to demonstrate specific points of congruence between two images that appear very similar from the start. Any demonstration, by an opposing barrister, of lack of congruence where there should be some, usually invalidates the finding completely. Sadly, the images in dispute look nothing like each other, and all attempts to make them do so by finding points of congruence – which are in themselves highly debatable – are, forensically, doomed to fail. Secondly, Dayvault makes (at least) two assertions which are demonstrably untrue by anyone with basic imaging software, namely: “The ONLY photograph which accurately and forensically corresponds to the unique landmark features of the frescoes is the highly detailed CDD shroud face image” and “In an attempt to disprove the hypothesis, overlay the Chapel fresco with another scaled photo of another person. Try your best to align them. (An observable exercise is futility.)” This last was the stimulus behind my first ‘try it yourself’ comment above. I maintain that my own face has at least as many points of congruence with the Chapel as that of the shroud, and would be happy to defend that position with detailed illustrations. Thirdly, and I admit that this might just be my own prejudice, but I’m not impressed by the fact that a number of nations have forensic science departments, and do not think that mentioning the ‘FBI, DHS Customs and Border Protection, New York City Police Department, Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department…. Australian Federal Police… ‘ etc, etc. Lends any authority to the article. At least to me, this sort of thing actually damages, rather than enhances, its credibility. Finally, like many researchers into offbeat matters, I should be delighted to change my mind if better evidence could be adduced. Perhaps one of the “several shroud colleagues” or better still the “forensic expert” mentioned in the article quoted above (but not, I note, in the ENCODED article itself) would like to explain how they were convinced..","date":"2012-11-04","mins":"10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/03/face-of-the-man-of-the-shroud-of-turin-encoded-in-sistine-chapel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Face of the Man of the Shroud of Turin Encoded in Sistine Chapel?"},{"id":"comment-63169","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I note that the Most Holy Family Monastery (vaticancatholic.com) has 869 videos credited to it on You Tube, while the Vatican (vatican) has 2259.

Another lamentation, painted ten years later, also shows these criss crosses, although the Shroud is not transparent. Before, between and after these paintings Fra Angelico painted a couple of dozen figures of Christ, on the cross and off it, and there are very few consistent elements. The criss crosses may be present or not, blood from the side wound may be spurting or a mere dribble, and the length of beard and style of moustache is variable. The hands are invariably nailed through the palms, from which blood dribbles down the underside of the arms as well as straight off, and the feet fastened with one nail, and Christ wears a crown of thorns.

I have the 26 page “Correlation of image intensity on the Turin Shroud with the 3 D structure of a human body shape” before me, specifically the graph labelled Figure 2. For those not familiar with Jumper and Jackson’s remarkably inventive technique, this is what they did. They photographed the head of a man lying on the ground from the side, with and without a cloth draped over it. By superimposing the two photographs, the vertical distance between the two outlines could be measured. As it is difficult to identify most of the body parts with sufficient specificity, data from 13 places on the real head was compared with intensity data from 13 equivalent places on the shroud. Figure 2 shows the relationship. Being good scientists, they find that although the null hypothesis (that there is no correlation between image intensity and cloth body distance) can be rejected, very little can be confidently asserted about what the relationship is. (The perfect match” quoted by daveb has, like so many derivations from original papers, become part of shroud dogma, but is in fact wholly fictitious.) They might have refined their calculations by omitting three, closely spaced results which appear to me to be outliers, but, being good scientists, they didn’t. These 13 cloth body measurements, of 13 points on the head, provide the whole rationale for every subsequent attempt to read three dimensional information from the shroud. And it works astonishingly well. Jumper and Jackson’s further investigations take the correlation as read, and devote the rest of their time to deforming the whole body image derived from it (which they find very unconvincing as is) until it matches the observed profile of a prone volunteer, thus establishing a theoretical cloth shape which looks entirely convincing. Other investigations using the same idea demonstrate that the cloth is more flexible along the warp than the weft, rather like, as I mentioned in an earlier comment, unrolling a carpet or a Venetian blind over a body.

Sadly, however, I fear that in many cases, “the desire to believe” was indeed the motive behind their attendance in the first place, and having been told what to think, they went away entirely satisfied. Even so, the idea that, had they been told equally authoritatively, in the same church, in the same supportive atmosphere, that the shroud was a fake, that they would then have abandoned Christianity, is absurd. Nor do I believe that “it is often stated by theists that they would abandon their faith if the bones of Jesus were found and it was shown he did not rise from the dead.” Astonishingly as it may seem to atheists, the truth of the Resurrection, although attested to by scripture, does not, ultimately, depend on history at all.

It is often stated that the dorsal image represents a taller man than the ventral image (which should be the other way round if the back of the cloth was flat on a ledge and the front was draped over a figure. Isabel Piczek thinks that the front legs are too short, and attributes this to the fact that they were bent, with the knees well off the group, in which case there should be no image of the back of the legs on the cloth. Some people think that the shoulders look dislocated, to account for the fact that the hands can hide the genitals, whir others think that the shoulders were slightly raised to account for this. Rigor mortis, lying on a stone pillow, even floating above the surface of the tomb, all these have been suggested by authenticists to account for what they see as patently inaccurate anatomical details. John’s simple faith in anatomical perfection, in short, doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Heller and Adler were very brilliant and accomplished scientists in their fields, and their lack of imagination about how the details of the shroud could be reproduced should not be held against them, but to treat their artistic speculations as the last word on the matter is absurd. I don’t know anyone who is searching frantically for an explanation of how the shroud appeared on the shroud. I know of several who have calmly investigated a variety of hypotheses, presented their findings for discussion, and either refined their line of thought or embarked on new ones. The image on the shroud appears to be unique among images; any explanation for it, regardless of provenance, is fanciful until it is considered established. What on earth is all that stuff about Christ’s crucifixion got to do with it? Does exploring a stained cloth mean I am fleeing from its truth? Or frightened of it? Dear me, it is because I am neither fleeing not frightened that I am able to investigate the shroud with the dispassion of the scientist.

John: “Faith not based on fact is not faith but superstition. St Paul, I believe, stated that if Christ did not rise from the dead than our faith is in vain.” Dead right. I am endlessly quoting St Augustine of Hippo, St Thomas Aquinas, Pope John Paul II’s ‘Fides et Ratio’ and Benedict XVI’s address at Regensburg. However, the genuineness of the shroud has no bearing on my faith in the resurrection, and I don’t believe it has on yours. If it were proved a fake tomorrow, would you convert? What to? Matthias: “There is just no issue there. I struggle to see anatomical abnormalities.” Apparently, so does John, but you are in a minority. Shroud/body configuration theories abound in order to correct percieved abnormalities. Just one point though – when you lie flat on the ground with your wrists crossed, what angle do they make? You’ll notice that the shroud man’s arms are very bent at the elbow, and meet at quite a wide angle at the wrists. Can you copy that? OK. Your measurements are impeccable. Why so many people disagree with them is beyond me. But they do. Piczek thinks that both the top and bottom of the shroud were horizontal, and the shortness of the legs is due to the foreshortening that comes from projecting the bent legs vertically upwards and downwards. If the cloth were tied under the knees, then there should be a non image band on both ventral and dorsal images, and there should be considerable lengthening of the upper legs as the cloth passes over the knees. And all that projection business – of course I understand. All the suggested radiation directions and cloth configurations are attempts to show how “anatomical perfection” would look when it appeared on a cloth. The trouble is, as I said before, that each of these possibilites has its adherents, all of whom think that the others’ versions are completely untenable, and would result in a distorted appearance. W says the legs are too short, and therefore must be the result of foreshortening; X says the arms are too long, and therefore must be the result of dislocation; Y says the neck is too short, and therefore must be the result of the head being on a pillow; Z says the buttocks are too rounded, and therefore must be the result of the body hovering in the air. All of them begin with the assumption that the shroud image is not, in itself, anatomical perfection, but a projection thereof. Trouble is, none of them agree how to achieve it. John: I think you’re correct in thinking that a body set rigidly in the position of a crucified person, whose arms were pulled out of position with some force to their site over the abdomen, is now fairly well accepted by authenticists. What they do not realise is that this is exactly the same scenario as a metal or wooden crucifix, whse arms were snapped off and placed in the same position – except for the actual site of the breakage, which is fortuitously hidden by some convenient burn marks….","date":"2013-11-27","mins":"11:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"id":"comment-52960","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, I’ve really no quarrel with any of these more recent remarks, because they do not address the point.

I have now examined Dr Diaz’s paper in detail, and those of his observations which are true are very simplistic, and those which are scientifically complex are not supported by evidence. Trying to understand how the connection came to be made leads me to guess that because chaotic cell growth sometimes produces blobs that loosely resemble embryos, and because some vaguely embryo like shapes can be seen in the burn marks of the shroud, there must be some connection. No such connection is established. Section 1 is devoted to the observation of embryo like shapes observed in irregular cellular masses. They range from the shape of a very early embryo with no observable limbs to an almost fully formed looking fetus with well defined wrists and ankles. In only one picture is there any evidence of an umbilical cord. So far, so unsurprising. These shapes could be found in any random assemblage of blobs. In spite of considerable care in discovering and photographing these shapes, there is no suggestion that they are, in fact, anything more than that. No evidence of spine, brain, bone or any organs is attested. Although some of the pictures shows a dark spot on the “head,” others show spots dotted around the body, and random separations and smudges. Section 2 is devoted to materials (photos of the shroud) and methods (attempting to match shapes on the shroud to “prior morphological visualisation” – start with a vague shape and try to match it somewhere). It is a very short section and does not explain what the prior morphological visualisations were or how they were matched to shapes on the shroud. Section 3 begins: “In horizontal position by extracting the central man that appears in the front image, we identify dark emission of central 10 12 spectral lines.” This is nonsense. No evidence is shown of how the ‘central man’ was ‘extracted.’ If he was, and it is possible, then we could be left with the famous ‘bands’ which are usually explained as artefacts of the random distribution of different darknesses of the hanks of warp threads in the cloth. The term ‘spectral lines’ is genuinely meaningless in this context. The next sentence is: “These spectral lines evince narrow alignment that delimiting head area and undergoes a curve, broadening at level of the lower extremities, this signify that some type of photon source energy its generate in the brain and decay slowly at distal level.” This is illustrated by a picture of the shroud, with 7 longitudinal lines sketched in stretching from wrists to ankles, spaced sufficiently widely to touch the patches on both sides, and 7 more from the top of the head to the stomach, closely spaced so that they fit within the frame of the hair. Allowing from translational difficulties, this appears to mean that Diaz observed dark lines radiating from the brain and widening out towards the feet. This observation is not illustrated in the paper, and the illustration which does accompany it does not show anything of the kind. Now the paper takes off into wild speculation without any evidence at all, and in direct contradiction to every previous observation or explanation of the shroud, whether for or against authenticity. “Outside the main body man image there is no evidence of these spectral lines.” This is simply not true, as a glance at shroudscope will verify. “The spectral lines generate a hexagonal pattern.” This is also not true, as a glance at the paper’s own accompanying illustration will verify. “Other chiral pattern are identified in terms of helicity waves.” This is an attempt to turn the outlines of the big water stains into wave pattern, which is explained in the caption to an accompanying illustration as due to “electromagnetic field wave polarisation.” Need I go on? After finding some vaguely embryo like shapes, Figure 18 compares them to a couple of fully formed foetuses, complete with fingers and toes.

I won’t comment on your medical observations, except that for a scientist to say something like: “Light and magnetism are reflections of the same substance,” in an introduction to some form of “Collision Event” theory is a disappointing start. There is no sense in which either light or magnetism are substances, nor in which they are reflections of any substance or each other. You go on to suggest that you made a model of light discharge over “lines of electrical conductance structured in helicoidal patterns.” If this means anything, it means flashing a lamp over some twisted wires carrying electric current. A diagram of your apparatus would seem to be a basic, even minimal requirement. But no matter, I am happy to leave you to your cancer cells. What you can’t get away with is your description of, and deductions from, the shroud. The core of your argument begins: “please observe the patches ,….. What pattern has the patches? Easy …. Triangular pattern …. Observe the organization of these triangular patterns , its is random ? … not. ..it is organized in chiral patterns that its mirror images,,, can purely fire make this spatial order …?? Not.” You go on later to say: “scientists who have analyzed so far have focused exclusively in the shroud man image without placing attention un the patterns that appear around the main image.” This is simply not true, although it is possible that you have not read the articles by Aldo Guerreschi and Michele Salcito (at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo3.pdf and http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo4.pdf) which comprehensively demonstrate how these marks, and the pattern they make, could have arisen without any need for the “piezoelectric activity of collagen.” The whole of the rest of your paper seems to be based on the idea that all the patched holes appeared more or less independently of each other, with the shroud opened out. Some very confused ideas about chirality, reflection, piezoelectric effects, electromagnetic, helicoidal waves and quantum entanglement are adduced to explain what would indeed be a remarkable event, if it were not entirely adequately explained by folding the shroud up and sticking a hot bar through it. This having been done, some water appears to have been poured through the damage, creating clear, dark rimmed stains just above each burn hole. These you liken to the heads of twin foetuses, and the area below them, which has no definition but is fortuitously bordered by burns and scorches, to their aborted bodies.

As for going off with the patibulum, one wonders what the Romans would have thought have of that. Did they use a fresh one every time? If so, and the patibulum went with the body to the tomb, did somebody subsequently put it back, so that Helena could find the crosses intact together hundreds of years later? Was the stipes stuck permanently in the ground (concreted, perhaps), or slotted into a hole, so that the whole cross could be laid flat for easy assembly and disassembly? Was the cross guarded? And if so, did the guards remove the body for the friends to dispose of it (once they knew it had been properly authorised), so they could keep the wood and nails for reuse? Alternative scenarios?

I had occasion, a few days ago to criticise a ‘comparison’ between the work of Walter Mc Crone and Heller & Adler, because although it was a reasonable analysis of the S Tu RP scientists, it said virtually nothing about Mc Crone. Here, I was expecting something to justify the blurb: “This talk explores the tension between scientific fact and religious faith in the identification and verification of a sacred relic.” and “Some of the conclusions drawn from that study [the S Tu RP expedition], and the absence or presence of scientific evidence for those conclusions, has led to perhaps the quintessential conflict between acceptance of the validity and veracity of the scientific method on the one hand, and religious belief and faith on the other.” But no. After a few interesting comments about good and bad science, Joel Bernstein merely recounted, sometimes word for word, Walter Mc Crone’s account, in ‘Judgement Day for the Turin Shroud’ of how he investigated the Shroud and the conclusions he drew from it. There was not a single mention of any other findings by any other scientist, let alone anything to dissent from Mc Crone’s painting hypothesis. Bernstein did recall Carl Sagan’s ‘Baloney Detecting Kit’, whose second tenet is ‘Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgable proponents of all points of view,’ but no alternative points of view, let alone debate, were even suggested, let alone debated. Another tenet is ‘Can others duplicate the experiment and get the same result?’ Bernstein seemed unaware that others had indeed duplicated the experiment (examining the fibres), but got a different result. In the question and answer session at the end, one of the audience asked if there were any chance of the radiocarbon dating being repeated, to which Bernstein’s reply (verbatim – see 1:12:06) was: “I recently saw another paper – they didn’t re date it but they checked all the data of those three institutions and came up with the conclusion there were no errors, the sampling was correct, and all that was perfectly legitimate.” I do not believe this is true. I have no reason to suppose that Bernstein is particularly interested in the Shroud for itself, and he is correct that it provides an excellent focus for a debate, or a lecture, on the dichotomy between scientific fact and religious faith.

Why this should be I’m not sure – possibly because ‘Science’ trumped ‘Art’ when it came to authority in those days, and the scientists involved in the Shroud showed little evidence of knowing much about painting. There was much talk of ‘a painting would seep through the cloth and be visible on the back’ and ‘a painting always shows the directionality of brush strokes’ and ‘a painting always has shadows which show where the light was coming from’ and even, ‘a painting always has outlines,’ all of which seem rather naive, and fairly obviously to anybody who’d actually visited an art gallery, simply untrue. They were on better ground in the search for pigment, although even here, they did not really know how much pigment could be sufficient, so that their arguments were not about whether there were any iron oxide particles, but whether there were enough to create an image. Mc Crone thought there were, and produced at least one experiment which appeared to demonstrate it. I do not know if it was challenged by any counter experiments showing the opposite. The scientists were on even better ground in their search for a colourless binder that would hold the pigment to the cloth. This, it could be reasoned, might remain even when most of the pigment had rubbed (or been washed) off. According to S Tu RP (Schwalbe & Rogers), Mc Crone’s chemical test for a proteinaceous binder (amido black) shows positive for any linen and could not have identified anything on top of it, while their own tests were more specific and definitely ruled out any protein on the image area. However they also ruled out any possibility of starch being the binder, a finding that was later retracted by Rogers, who decided he could find some after all. This suppported his ‘starch and saponin’ surface layer hypothesis, but could also support Mc Crone in his search for a binder. Even lower, as it were, than the binder, would be any chemical deterioration of the cloth itself, caused by pigment, binder, or carrier, all of which had disappeared. Guarlaschelli’s painting hypothesis depends on this, I think, and chemically, has not been demonstrated to be untenable. So, no, the painting hypothesis has not definitely been ruled out..","date":"2014-09-24","mins":"3:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/21/lest-the-wrath-of-god-descend-upon-them-like-a-ton-of-bricks/","cat":"humor","title":"Lest the wrath of God descend upon them like a ton of bricks"},{"id":"comment-151879","author":"hugh_farey","post":"You say TOM AH TOES, I say TOM AY TOES; let’s agree they sound exactly the same… In a recent conversation at Shroud Science, Giulio Fanti expressed his belief that the entire radiocarbon sample was from the date determined by the laboratories (1300 or so), without any contamination, but was part of a larger patch, the borders of which have yet to be determined.

Thus the sides of the cheeks appear to be cut off by a clear vertical edge, when in fact they are not so well defined; they just appear so because of the weave.

Three references to the “traditional” horizontal position of the arms led me to believe the setting up of a straw man, but I think I was mistaken. Attempts to get blood to flow down an arm were made from three different ‘exit wound’ sites, at angles from “0° (arm parallel to the groud and perpendicular to the body) to 90° (vertical arm).” It was found that blood would only flow down the arm at “greater than 80°” which is, indeed, a good deal more vertical than any “traditional” position. The idea that there were two blood flow angles, as illustrated above, was explored many years ago. The zigzag pattern was created, it was suggested, by blood flowing vertically down the arm and stopping in minor clots along the way, which, when the arm was more horizontal, then changed direction and dripped straight off. This was quite ingenious, and I experimented with it myself twenty years ago, but was wholly unable to produce anything like the pattern we see on the Shroud. The fact that in all this time nobody has reported success suggests that either the experiment has continuously failed, or that the researches of Garlaschelli and Borrini are long overdue. Mike’s suggestion, that the blood would flow along the sloping arm if the flow was slow, or vertically off it if the flow was faster, also needs experimental corroboration.

A whiter backing cloth would reflect more of all wavelengths, but the overall shape of the spectrum would not be affected, I think. As to the red spike, it puzzles me enormously. From the spectra I have found on the internet, it seems that ‘red’ minerals reflect little visible light from roughly 400 500nm, and lots from 600 700nm. The shape of their spectra is basically a step. ‘Brown’ things have a spectrum which slopes gradually from little at low wavelengths to lots at high wavelengths. Green and blue minerals have reflectance spectra that look like hills at around about their appropriate frequencies, but nothing is typified by a spike. Spikes do appear in the spectra of biological material, such as various algae, but I imagine that that sort of material would degrade quite quickly, and cannot think of anything (a lichen perhaps?) with a stable red colour. It beats me, then. Maybe others have good ideas about it?.","date":"2013-04-13","mins":"5:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-30727","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The images I use to contrast ventral/dorsal images and front/back sides of the cloth are at http://shroud.wikispaces.com/PROPERTIES.

Perhaps he was only referring to the bloodstains. I’m interested in Colin’s (and my) observation that “Most of the original blood has probably flaked off, leaving just a pinkish coloration.” Looking at individual ribs of thread, it seems to me that while some of them have indeed retained a ‘pinkish colouration,’ some of them seem to be the same colour as the off bloodstain threads. None of them seem to be lighter than the off bloodstain threads. Since all the off bloodstain threads are image threads, and not only that, but particularly dark image threads (being on the prominent brow), this suggests that the base colour of the shroud under the bloodstains is the same as the un bloodstained image areas – in other words that the darkening of the shroud due to image formation occurred before the application of the bloodstains..","date":"2013-04-14","mins":"5:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-30617","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, the good thing about those early papers is that they are quite easily understandable. When we look at a patch of cloth and say it’s green, and then look at its spectrum and see a big reflectance hill around 543nm, that’s easy to understand. That’s why I like reflectance spectra better than absorbance. However, we could see its spectrum and see nothing in the ‘green’ range, but twin spikes in the blue and yellow. A patch of cloth made of alternating blue and yellow threads looks green, but if we examined individual threads, we wouldn’t see green at all, but blue or yellow. (I actually know this because our school uniform skirts are made of a blue and yellow tartan, which looks green at a distance). Now if, for example, the shroud linen threads consisted of, say, 90% yellow fibres and 10% bright red ones, then we might see that anomalous spike in the spectrum, and be able to resolve it by looking more closely at the individual fibres. However, when we found these bright red fibres (or paint flakes, or whatever they might be) they would still have to be made of a material with a distinctly ‘spiky’ spectrum, which so far I can’t identify. As for identifying individual spectra of layers of different colours, that would be a bit of a poser. However, by overlaying a transmission spectrum (light shining from behind) and a reflectance spectrum (from above), you might be able to identify wavelengths of light absorbed by the material underneath, and thus deduce something about its colour. So a twin layer of red and green would look red by reflected light, but black if you tried to shine a light through it, showing that there was an absorption of the red by the layer beneath it. If the spectra of the two layers were individually quite irregular patterns (such as those of blood and cloth), then subtracting the one from the other might enable you to derive the colour of the hidden material. Maybe an expert in authenticating paintings would have some ideas along those lines?.","date":"2013-04-13","mins":"12:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-174139","author":"hugh_farey","post":"We are the peers, Paulette, you and me and Oskar and Andrea and Yannick and Max and everybody called David and all the rest.

It was not “silly” to believe that the Besançon shroud was the genuine shroud even though it looked obviously like a painting; being miraculous, it could have looked like anything. The French revolutionaries did not have to show that it was a painting, they had to show that it was fabricated by a human, not a God, which is why they had to concoct their stencil.

My own view is that the Turin Shroud was more ‘realistic’ than the Besançon one, but that was not really my point, which was that a relic did not have to look realistic to be accepted as genuine, it only had to have official sanction. Whether or not the revolutionaries really found a 200 year old stencil, the fact that they said they had was sufficient to discredit the Besançon shroud which has been accepted as genuine by saints and pilgrims for two hundred years. I have read Bergier carefully, and am intrigued as to why he particularly wanted to discredit the Besançon shroud, but was not particularly interested in supporting or denying all the other shrouds he knew. He says the the Turin shroud better represents the sort of cloth that might wrap a dead body, but does’t go so far as to say he thinks it, or any of the others, genuine.

Ainsi les linceuls ou suaires que l’on montre dans plusieurs églises ne peuvent avoir servi à la sépulture du Sauveur, d’autant plus que le tissu de ces suaires est d’un ouvrage assez moderne.” After a description of the Quem Quaeritis ceremony, Bergier goes on to make exactly Charles Freeman’s point, that all these Shrouds were in fact theatrical props. “Au mot ‘sudarium’ on montroit au peuple un linceul empreint de la figure de Jésus Christ enseveli. Ces linceuls ou suaires conservés dans les trésors des églises, pour qu’ils servissent toujours au même usage, ont été pris dans la suite pour des linges qui avoient servi à la sépulture de notre Sauveur; voilà pourquoi il s’en trouve dans plusieurs églises différentes, à Cologne, à Besançon, à Turin, à Brioude, etc.; et l’on s’est persuadé qu’ils avoient été apportés de la Palestine dans le temps des croisades. “Il ne s’ensuit point de là que ces suaires ne méritent aucun respect, ou que le culte qu’on leur rend est superstitieux.

However, it is clear that Bergier did not believe that any of the shrouds were genuine, and that they had all been manufactured for religious ceremonies. It is also notable that he recognises that shrouds used for this ceremony had the image of Christ on them. This is exactly Charles Freeman’s belief as well. I’m not sure how secure is Dorothy’s Crispino’s assertion that the Besançon shroud was actually created as a prop for the 1523 exposition. If you have a text for this it would be useful. She says that on “March 27, the chapter made a formal decision that ‘the shroud’ should be secured in a chest with three locks and three keys.” I find that strange, for a ‘theatrical prop.’ She goes on to say that “Paul de Gail sees in this event the recent acquisition by the church of what came to be called the Besançon shroud.” The word acquisition is significant. Acquired from where? From an artist’s studio? Or from some other source? Although it was clearly used in the Quem Quaeritis ceremony, it was obviously given some considerable veneration, possibly, as Dorothy guesses, because it had been touched to the true shroud elsewhere, or possibly because it was much older and had some more respectable provenance.

Firstly, Orozco’s ‘imagen original’ only shows one of the two dark stripes on either side of the face that some people think are miscolourations in the threads rather than in the image. I wonder why, or how, this particular image was used. Secondly, one has to be very precise about exactly what any particular FFT does. The weave of the Shroud means that the image appears largely on the warp threads, and not on the weft. Thus the warp threads are darker than the weft threads. However, in any photo, the weft threads appear the darker, because they are in shadow, forming ‘valleys’ between the warp thread ‘ridges.’ If we wish to remove the diagonal striping, we can average out the colour between say, a weft thread and one or both of its adjacent warp threads, or we could lighten the weft threads until they match the colour or intensity of the warp threads on either side. The latter would be preferable. What’s more, such ‘blood’ as remains on the Shroud is largely confined to the ‘valleys’ between the ‘ridges’ having been abraded from the more superficial threads, so that weft ‘bloodstain’ threads really are darker than ‘warp’ bloodstain’ threads, as well as appearing darker anyway because of the shadow effect. To achieve a uniform ‘blood’ colour, it would be better to lighten the weft a little to remove the shadow, and then to darken the warp to replace the blood where it has been worn off. I would like to know what exactly any particular FFT achieves in real terms.

However I’m still not what Roemer’s point is. 1) His first paragraph is surely quite incorrect. Neither his ‘old’ model nor his ‘new’ model are now or have ever been recognised by evolutionary biologists. The gradual accumulation of adaptive characteristics cannot be modelled in either of those terms, and never has been. 2) If the last sentence of paragraph two is intended to be supported by the rest of the paragraph, then the paragraph is a non sequitur. The facts that a gas expands to fill its container, whereas in space a gas contracts to generate a star cannot be directly compared. Indeed the second law of thermodynamics predicts that where the energy of escaping from gravity is greater than the energy of gravitational attraction, a gas will not fill up its container. This is why the earth has an atmosphere, for instance. The behaviour of gases has no direct relevance to the evolution of organisms, which are not gases. 3) I do understand that particles move faster when they are hotter. For all I know he may be right in saying that the kinetic energy of a gas molecule increases by 10000000000000000000000 times for every degree heated, although it seems quite a lot to me. Is that really what Boltzmann’s constant implies? 4) The fact that a number of entities can be arranged in billions of different ways has no relevance to evolution. The number of possible proteins is constrained by a number of other conditions unrelated to the mathematical calculation, and even if it were not, proteins are not formed by the random accumulation of amino acids. 5) Roemer is correct in saying that evolution does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. The only ‘non physicists’ who think it does are people whose understanding of the universe comes from a mistaken interpretation of various religious scriptures. 6) I have recently read two ‘scholarly papers’ (in the American Journal of Physics, brought to my attention by David Roemer himself) which refute the idea that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. Neither of them is so simplistic as to claim that that ‘nature goes from order to disorder’. They both explain comprehensively how the entropy of the universe is not decreased by anything that happens on earth, and that any local or apparent decrease in entropy is invariably outweighed by an overall increase elsewhere. 7) While Roemer is correct in saying that solar radiation tends to increase the entropy of the universe, he is wrong to apply this generalisation to photosynthesis. The decrease in entropy due to photosynthesis is trivial compared to the overall increase due to solar radiation, and is at any rate temporary. 8) The article to which Roemer specifically refers (Styer, 2008) makes huge generalisations concerning the rate of evolution, and applies figures derived from these to standard entropy equations. The equations are not ‘fake,’ although the figures may be ‘absurd.’ A subsequent paper (Bunn, 2009) made serious adjustments to Styler’s figures, but the equations were just as relevant and the conclusion identical – that in sheer mathematical terms evolution does not break the second law of thermodynamics. In other papers, mathematicians making different assumptions come to the conclusion that evolution actually increases entropy, which more obviously doesn’t violate the second law. After all that I still do not understand Roemer’s fundamental conviction. If it is simply that he disagrees with Daniel Styer’s numerical assumptions then he may well be right and others concur. However their papers have been accepted rather than his because they have explained precisely where his assumptions were erroneous and proffered better ones of their own. If, on the other hand, Roemer believes that evolution is intrinsically impossible according to currently understood science, and that an alternative science must be adduced to explain it, then I think he should say so..","date":"2012-12-04","mins":"5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"id":"comment-19836","author":"hugh_farey","post":"“No evolutionary biologist thinks natural selection acting upon random mutations or genetic engineering explains the complexity of mammals.” I fear this is spectacularly untrue, and that almost exactly the opposite is more accurate: Almost ALL evolutionary biologists think that… etc, etc. James Shapiro has done some fascinating work on manipulated DNA mutation, and his paradigm shift in favour of degrees of genetic information rather than discreet genes is interesting, but hardly earth shattering.

Almost by definition, “selection” suggests that a variety of things already exist, from which one or more may be ‘selected,’ and others rejected. As far as that goes, I could not disagree. However, “evolution” consists firstly of the provision of variety, through mutation, genetic drift and sexual recombination, and only secondly of “Natural Selection.” To equate Evolution and Natural Selection is wrong, and repeating the fact that Selection explains variety but not innovation does not make it right. Not being a high school or college teacher I do not have access to textbooks, but I do not believe that they restrict their explorations of evolution to Natural Selection alone, and to imply that they do is a gross distortion of their intent. For the edification of anybody else who may be following this thread, here are a couple of quotes from the internet: – British Natural History Museum: “Evolution is driven by random changes in the genes of organisms, called mutations, and a complex process called natural selection.” – Biology Online: Evolution is “the change in genetic composition of a population over successive generations, which may be caused by natural selection, inbreeding, hybridization, or mutation.” – And even Wikipedia: “Life evolves by means of mutations (changes in an organism’s hereditary information), genetic drift (random change in the genetic variation of a population from generation to generation), and natural selection (the non random and gradual process of natural variation by which observable traits (such as eye color) become more or less common in a population).” However, I do find that some avowedly creationist / intelligent design sites, and for I know their textbooks too, do try to omit mutation from their considerations of evolution, presumably because it is easier to deny evolution if you ignore half of its exposition..","date":"2012-12-05","mins":"9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"id":"comment-19886","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well gentlemen, I think I finally understand both your fundamental positions, and perhaps paradoxically, largely agree with them. “En arche en ho Logos,” begins St John’s Gospel – and I use Greek because arche is not well translated by beginning nor logos by word.

A painting might have appeared miraculously after Jesus had simply wiped his face on a cloth, just as curing somebody need not require the laying on of hands or the application of any substance.

That enlightening tome “Last Journey and Memorials of the Redeemer, or Via Crucis, as it is in Jerusalem” by the Rev. J.J. Begel, published in 1880, explains how. “Since, as in the case of the cross, this abundance might become a pretext for denying their authenticity, we will endeavour to show that the Jewish manner of burial required large quantities of linen.” … “Hence the multiplicity of shrouds is now no longer a problem, and that great question of former times, who possesses the true shroud, the authentic shroud of our Saviour, has no longer any weight, and merely proves long ignorance of a fact.” Nor was the existence or not of an image at all a problem. “We know that after the embalming and enshrouding the ancients painted the mummies exteriorly. This was the last operation before restoring them to the family or bearing them to the tomb. From this cause, I think, among the holy shrouds that remain to us, some bear the image — not, indeed, very artistic, and traced with hurried hand— of our Saviour extended lifeless, and others do not.” Interestingly: “The two shrouds which bear the print of the body of Jesus Christ are that of Turin, in Piedmont, and that of Besancon, in Franche Comte. … In this last the painting is not so vivid nor the traits so distinct as in the shroud of Turin.”.","date":"2014-11-25","mins":"5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"id":"comment-172847","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think anoxie is misrepresenting Colin, and he is certainly misrepresenting me. Colin has been working on S Tu RP’s own assessment of the image as degraded cellulose. This, as they all pointed out, looks just like a scorch. They decided it couldn’t be because a) a scorch fluoresces and b) a scorch burns through to the other side. Colin quickly demonstrated that b is nonsense, and various other things as well – a scorch can show image density resembling a body/distance correlation, and a scorch is essentially a contact mechanism, not a radiation mechanism. However, niggling problems remained, and so he began to work on how to produce an effect indistinguishable from a scorch, but with lower heat and different chemicals. This is what I mean by “a kind of” scorch. His point about sweat is in contrast to Charles Freeman’s brighly coloured paint hypothesis. One thing a scorch does not look like is a brightly coloured painting. However, the Shroud has been described as being derived from sweat several times by pilgrims, who were saying what they saw, not suggesting a manufacturing process. If the Shroud was originally brightly coloured, then it could not have been intended to be its current brownish tinge, and any kind of scorch would have been a incidental byproduct, not a deliberate intention. This is my position, currently, although it could change any minute, and was cheerfully derided by Stephen Jones as he deliberately misinterpreted my statement to the effect that I thought the whole thing had been created by accident. Colin’s position is that Charles is wrong, and that the Shroud was deliberately intended to look like a sweat imprint from the start, so the “kind of scorch” that we see today was an integral part of the plan.

There are even convoluted explanations as to how some shrouds had one image while the Turin Shroud has two. Max’s comment: “Its veneration was not so much linked to its being considered genuine as both being a shroud copy of or shroud substitute” is not borne out by the remarks of the 19th century commentators. In case of misunderstanding, I don’t think Colin personally thinks the Shroud was any kind of body bag; however he is perfectly correct in saying that it was often described as the sheet into which Jesus was immediately placed after being taken down from the cross, or the sheet in which Jesus was transported to the tomb, in order to differentiate it from the several sheet/s in which Jesus was wrapped once in the tomb. It is perfectly possible that the Shroud of Besancon was destroyed in 1349, and also that that of Turin was destroyed in 1532.

When a “new” relic appeared, such as the Shroud, I suppose it was natural for supporters of rivals to try to denigrate it as much as possible. Nearly all the miraculous images, whether or not we include the Shroud, looked like obvious paintings, so it was easy to claim that while my painting was a miracle, yours was cooked up by an artist a few years ago. After a while, when the new relic had achieved popularity, respectability and episcopal, or papal, approbation (invariably in that order), then of course it had to be assimilated into the canon. The only denigrations I have seen are those of Pierre D’Arcis, but I dare say there were others of the various veronicas, shrouds and other images as they turned up. It is true that my sources are 19th century rather than, say 15th or 16th century, but can anyone say that individual relics were being denouced as fakes then? Apart, of course, from people like Calvin, who didn’t think any of them had any validity. Max’s next two points do not support his own argument. The Shroud which was turned into bandages was destroyed in the face of popular belief in its authenticity, as a deliberate challenge to it, by an avowedly atheistic authority. His third point, that relic authenticity was based first and foremost on certificates of authenticity not just popular beliefs, does not fully reflect the close relationship between the two.

B) Scorching linen and observing the results is something anybody can do in their kitchen! c) Although degrading cellulose by scorching may not be the answer, experiments with superficiality, 3 D imaging and UV fluorescence may suggest a mechanism that can be achieved in other ways (gas diffusion or painting, for example).

I do not detect any variation of image ‘transfer’ between the front and back images, and must state that for me, at least, the first statement is simply wrong, and therefore there is no need to account for it. The illusion of a more complete image on the front may have been brought about by the blood marks, particularly on the arms, which help to define the middle of the body shape on the ventral, but not, of course, on the dorsal image. In fact by carefully surveying the entire picture, I cannot find anything on the back of the shroud which is not present on the front – except one thing, which other researchers may be able to explain. Here goes: The colouration of the back of the shroud is mostly typified by a dark longitudinal stripe right down the middle, with a sharp edge on the nail wound side, and a more attenuated edge on the spear wound side. At first thought, one would guess that it was due to different batches of warp thread, differently processed, and so producing differently coloured longitudinal bands. However, I have always understood that the front side of the shroud was the side with the greater warp thread visibility – 75% – (thanks to the 3/1 twill), while the proportion of visible warp thread on the back was only 25%. That being so, longitudinal bands should be more pronounced on the front side, which is not what we observe..","date":"2013-02-06","mins":"12:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/06/teaser-of-the-day-6-there-are-no-stars-in-the-sky/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","title":"Teaser of the Day (#6): There are no stars in the sky"},{"id":"comment-23157","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The rest of my comment is a gripping read too…..","date":"2013-02-01","mins":"9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/01/teaser-of-the-day-under-the-guise-of-being-an-objective-established-observation/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","title":"Teaser of the Day:  Under the guise of being an objective “established” observation."},{"id":"comment-216966","author":"hugh_farey","post":"No I don’t think there’s a contradiction, Mario. If an ancient ‘authentic relic of Christ’ had had a miraculous double image, I think Colin is correct in supposing that it would have been most unlikely not to have been well known. However, a mere liturgical prop need not have excited any particular interest, regardless of its illustration. At some point, of course, Charles Freeman’s contention is that the cloth was transformed from ‘mere prop’ to ‘authentic relic’ and it was at that point that Henri de Poitiers stepped in to correct the misapprehension. He knew that such liturgical ‘shrouds’ were common, and considered it absurd that the Canons of Lirey were attempting to pass one off as an authentic relic. So far, I think, so sensible. However, I do see some major objections to this scenario. If the Shroud had been brought from a long way away, from an area where the Quem Quaeritis was common to a place where it was unknown, or if it had been hidden away for a long time after the Quem Quaeritis tradition had died out, then its transformation would be understandable, but Bishop Henri claimed to have known the painter, which suggests recent, local manufacture. Charles thinks that a supposed ‘miracle’ associated with the cloth might have enhanced its reputation, but nobody who had known it before the miracle would have accepted it as the authentic burial cloth, miracle or not. One might speculate that a painter from somewhere else could have created a deliberate forgery based upon his knowledge of Quem Quaeritis shrouds (and assuming that Lirey had no such tradition), but I agree that there is no evidence for such a speculation. I agree completely that the historical and artistic arguments for a 13th/14th century manufacture are far from decisive, but then, the authenticist route from Jerusalem to Lirey, via Edessa, Constantinople, the Templars, the Crusades, the Mandylion and other possibilities is also far from decisively established..","date":"2015-12-21","mins":"12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-216941","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I agree with your position, Thomas, in that an artist wanting to forge a miraculous image would have no cultural context or tradition to produce a double front and back portrait. At this late stage (the 14th century was towards the end of the relic making – or discovering – craze), he might have decided not to produce an out and out painting which was simply declared miraculous (like most of the other imaged cloths), and, as a sop to the increasing rationality of the age, produced one in monochrome that could be thought of as a ‘sweat’ or ‘blood’ imprint, but at first sight there seems no reason to produce a long thin cloth (most un shroud like) with a double image. However! If he was not producing a ‘relic’, but a liturgical illustration, for the particular purpose of being displayed across the Sanctuary of a church, held in front of or behind an altar on Easter Sunday, having wrapped a wooden body of Christ (quietly removed by clerics on Saturday evening) lying in a side chapel since being placed there on Good Friday, then he might well have produced a long thin cloth, with a representation of what a real body might have produced had it laid within it. This explanation would seem fanciful if we did not have countless accounts of just such a re enactment occurring in monasteries, churches, and then outside during the development of mystery plays. The ‘Shrouds’ undoubtedly existed, and in vast numbers across Europe, although, in common with almost every other similar mystery play prop, not a single one remains. It is true that we have no description of any such Shroud, imaged or otherwise, and the few paintings of the scene do not show an image either, but such vestiges as remain can hardly be considered representative of the whole.

The development of the liturgical drama involving characters, a tomb in a side chapel, and a shroud seem to have begun in the 9th or 10th century (see, for example, The Latin Passion Play, Its Origins and Development, by Sandro Sticca). By the 14th century its use was widespread all over Europe. Chifflet was talking of actual relics; he does not even mention the liturgical props, with or without an image on them. He certainly does not deny their existence. Although there are countless mentions of such shrouds, they are not described at all, and none remain. Such a lack of evidence does not preclude the possibility that some were painted. I’m not sure what you mean by: “The religious authorities at Troyes reasoned that such an image could not exist”. Bishop d’Arcis did say that had the real Shroud of Christ had an image on it the Gospels would have mentioned it, but the shrouds exhibited as part of the Quem Quaeritis ceremony were not intended to be mistaken for the real thing. They were illustrative, and educational, and I do not think that precludes the possibility that some were painted either.

I have tried to explain how the precise features of the Shroud fit the Quem quaeritis ceremony above and in other posts… 1) “The Shroud image is not one of a glorified risen Christ.” Well, of course not. As explained above, it was specifically to show the traces of a dead body. The whole point was that it was the shreds left behind, not anything to do with the Resurrection. 2) “Why show an imaged burial shroud ‘to show Christ had risen’ if there was no tradition of a full body imaged shroud?” There was no tradition of any particular kind of Shroud. I think the faint image (and I differ from Charles on this point) was not to show a miraculous effect – which would certainly have been talked about and well known if such a tradition had been extant – but simply to differentiate this cloth as a ‘shroud’ from any other cloth, such as a table cloth or bed sheet. 3) “The Shroud itself is of such length as to be quite a nuisance to ‘hold up’”. It certainly required two people, but I think that was the whole point, to be able to hold up something clearly ’empty’ before an entire congregation. 4) “Why ‘manufacture’ a front and back image?” Holding up a ‘shroud’ for all the congregation to see meant that long and thin was obviously easier for the back rows than a squarer sheet, much of which was too low. Having decided on long and thin – a most unlikely shape for a real shroud, I may say – then the shape of the man wrapped in it, back and front, would fill the space better than a single image in the middle. Elsewhere I have also suggested that this may also be the reason why the images are placed head to head – also an unlikely configuration for a real shroud – rather that feet to feet. 5) “The nude image goes against the art history grain.” Yes, it does, but again, I don’t think this scenario should be considered ‘art’ in any modern sense. Medieval theatre props were produced in their thousand, and not a single one remains. This was not a ‘work of art’ but a utilitarian indication of a body in a shroud for a drama. As such, I don’t think it broke any taboos. (And no, Charles has never said that there was originally a loin cloth that wore off. He suggested that at a much later date a loin cloth was painted on and that that has worn off, or been removed. That possibility is also highly debatable, but it is irrelevant to the origin of the Shroud.) Nothing definitive, I quite agree, and to those who think the Quem quaeritis hypothesis untenable, I have nothing but sympathy. However, I hope that they will at least have some idea why I think it could provide a reasonable context for a medieval origin, and have some sympathy in return!.","date":"2015-12-22","mins":"5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-216957","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Your “1997 CE RED HEIFER WATER IN SOAKING & XYLOALOETIC FUMIGATION IMPRINTING”?

I see it begins (page 40): “Or incontinent apres le commencement du 13. Siecle l’on voit la ceremonie de la monstre du sainct Suaire au jour de Pasques, couchee dans un certain ceremonial escrit devant l’union des deux Eglises de S. Jean, & de S. Estienne, faite en l’annee 1253. Car cette ceremonie n’est point descripte dans le Rituel, comme nouvelle, mais bien comme en usage quelques annees auparavant: ce qui nous fait conjecturer que la ville de Besançon fut bien heuree de ce present environ l’an 1100.” You may be able to help with the translation, as although it seems clear to me that the Quem Quaeritis ceremony was obviously well known in Besançon long before the arrival of its more famous Shroud, it also seems that the people may have been using another, non authentic, shroud before the ‘authentic’ one appeared. In the book I mentioned, The Latin Passion Play, mentions on page 23 “two documents, both of the tenth century: the Regularis Concordia of St. Ethelwold of Winchester and the Quem quaeritis version from Saint Martial of Limoges. Composed between 965 and 975, the Regularis Concordia contains rules […] and describes religious ceremonies […]. In it are found the earliest stage directions for the performance of an Easter play: the Quem quaeritis:” The Latin directions are then quoted, including: “Quo viso, deponant turribula, que gestaverant in eodem Sepulchro, sumantque linteum et extendant contra clerum, ac veluti ostendentes, quod surrexit Dominus et iam non sit illo involutus, […]. Superponante linteum altari.” “Having seen this, they lay down the thuribles with which they have been honouring the Tomb, and pick up the shroud, holding it out towards the clergy, as if to show that the Lord has risen from it and is no longer wrapped in it. … They place the shroud on the altar.” In the few pages, the book goes on to discuss both antecedents to and the extensive expansion of the ceremony in its dramatic form over the next few centuries. In all this, however, I can find no description of the shroud – big or small, square or long, painted or not. However I do not think that my reconstruction, particularly as it pertains to quite a late comer to the field (400 years later), by which time the ceremony was much more clearly developed, is merely fanciful. The very fact that the Besançon shroud, which seems to have been an obvious painting, existed, lends some credibility to this hypothesis, don’t you think?.","date":"2015-12-22","mins":"5:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-217061","author":"hugh_farey","post":"You are certainly stimulating more research, Mario!

Brooks doesn’t even mention shrouds. Suggestive, but no smoking gun yet. Then we get to “Encyclopédie méthodique. Théologie. T. 3” (about 1790) at http://gallica.bnf.fr., and Abbé Bergier’s conclusion that “on conclut que le corps de Jésus Christ ne fut point enveloppé d’un linceul entier, mais seulement avec des bandelettes comme Lazare. Ainsi les linceuls ou Suaires que l’on montre dans plusieurs Eglises ne peuvent avoir servi à la sépulture du Sauveur, d’autant plus que le tissue de ces Suaires est d’un ouvrage assez moderne. Il est probable que dans le douzième & le treizième siècles, lorque [sic] la coutume s’introduisie de représenter les Mystères dans les Eglises, on représenta le jour de Pâques la Résurrection de Jésus Christ. On y chantoit la Prose Victimae Pascali, etc. Dans laquelle on fait dire à Madelaine: Sepulchrum Chrisit viventis & gloriam vidi resurgentis, Angelicos testes, sudarium & vestes: Au mot Sudarium on montroit au peuple un linceul empreint de la figure de la figure de Jésus Christ enseveli.

The first is Ray Rogers’s finding that fibres from the Shroud lack a vanillin component that some medieval fibres retain, and the second is Giulio Fanti’s explorations into the deterioration of linen fibres with age. Sadly neither of these has sufficient calibratory accuracy to pin the date to the first century (leaving aside Fanti’s rather fortuitous concocting of an average from a number of wildly different dates from vastly different techniques), and neither has any kind of scientfic consensus as a dating method which could be applied to other textiles, which would give them an objective credibility. Everything else is circumstantial, and some of it not evidence for a date at all. Pollen and limestone speak of the place, not the time, and the fact that the Shroud image coheres with Gospel narratives tells us nothing of the date at all. Miraculous hypotheses tell us even less, and generally tend to constrain, rather than display, the omnipotence of the Almighty. Authenticists have to rely on documentation and art. I do not deny that this is evidence, and some of it quite powerful, but the smoking gun is still sadly lacking. John Klotz and daveb often remind us that circumstantial evidence with sufficient power can sometimes be enough to sway a jury, but this blog is witness to the fact that it has not swayed enough of us to be considered conclusive yet. BUT “Can anybody put me on to the scientific evidence that the Shroud dates to after AD 1300?” As far as I know there is a single piece of direct evidence pointing to a medieval date. Radiocarbon dating has massive scientific consensus as a dating technique, and is widely used in all kinds of circumstances. Barring deliberate fraud, there is little reason to suppose that the sample dated to 1300 was inaccurately dated. There have been numerous attempts to demonstrate that the sample tested was not representative, but they have not achieved consensus. Other evidence is circumstantial. The lack of clear documentation before 1350, the coherence of the Shroud to the religious rituals and theological trends in art of the 14th/15th century, and the claim that it was known who painted it are all evidence, some more powerful than others, but the smoking gun is still sadly lacking.

The whole idea of two or three, or half a dozen, undisputed “Shrouds”, and a similar number of smaller cloths or coifs, is generally untenable to modern thinking (although I note there are a few sites which still support it, and the Oviedo cloth has similar acceptance to the Turin Shroud). However, for several centuries previously, all these cloths were considered authentic, and a rationale had to be concocted to account for them. Whether Jesus was wrapped up in all these cloths simultaneously or at different times was variously sorted out by different people, who probably disagreed with each other. Whatever Adrien Baillet’s own enlightenment view (thanks Thibault), the idea that both that the Besancon and Turin Shrouds were authentic was clearly current in his time. What’s more, whereas we now think (rationally) that no clear image could be obtained while lowering or carrying a body in a cloth, this was not a problem to earlier minds, for whom even an obvous painting could have simply been an example of a miracle. Earlier on this subject, someone commented that nobody could imagine that after wiping his sweaty blood smeared face with a cloth, a beautiful painting could have been left on it, when in fact this was exactly what people thought, and in some cases still do. In some ways, it occurs to me, the Turin Shroud was ahead of its time, bearing a more or less “realistic” imprint, when there was really no need for it to be anything more than a painting. Could this be because the late 13th century was really quite late in the craze for relics, and a more rational approach to miracles had already begun to manifest itself?.","date":"2014-11-28","mins":"3:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-173786","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Are Andrea and daveb arguing at cross purposes? Daniel Scavone himself writes, as the opening sentence of his “Documenting the Shroud’s Missing Years” that “History proceeds from documents, not arguments from silence. Besançon alone, of all the major theories of the Turin Shroud’s whereabouts during the missing 150 years, has documents to support its possession of the Shroud after the Fourth Crusade until about 1350, after which the Shroud’s history from Lirey to Turin is well established.” He then reviews various letters and documents from about 1200. Assuming that these were not subsequent forgeries, which is not necessarily wise, the question then becomes; do these documents support the hypothesis that Otho de la Roche owned a shroud? Scavone refers to a letter written from the Emperor Alexius V Mourtzouphlus to Pope Innocent III in 1204, specifically complaining that the Holy Shroud had been stolen by Otho de la Roche, which is evidence, if not conclusive. The letter may be a forgery, or the shroud may have been a different one from Turin’s, or the Emperor was mistaken, but there is a document, and that’s what it says. Now for the image. Scavone gives no evidence that the Besancon shroud bore an image, but only assumes that it must have done by conjecturing that it became the Turin Shroud in about 1350.

So, following my promise of always following up any theory, this, I think, is what you propose. Please correct me if I’m wrong, and attempt to answer some of the questions, which are not contradictions, but requests for clarification. 1) Having been scourged and tortured, and now covered in blood sweat and dust, Jesus was dressed in the Tunic of Argenteuil. 2) After being crucified, he was taken down from the cross in a rigid state of rigor mortis, and his face covered with the Sudarion of Oviedo. 3) Arriving at the tomb, he was laid on the Shroud on a preparation table, which had two stones or bags of myrrh granules placed to elevate the body from the surface, and the Shroud laid over them. 4) Leaving the body unwashed and unwiped, the Shroud was folded back over the top of his body, and secured tightly with the Veil of Manopello, the Cap of Cahors, and the Sindon Munda. 5) The shroud itself was wet, having been soaked in an alkaline mixture including Red Heifer water, Jerusalem limestone and powdered starch. Ammonia derived from urea in the sweat may have contributed to the alkalinity. 6) Within the wrappings, various bits of plant material, and wooden artefacts were also placed. 7) The body was then fumigated on both sides with vapours arising from the myrrh and aloes, which contained a blood intensifier. 8) As a result of the fumigation or a natural drying process, the Shroud shrunk, pulling itself away from the body to leave various areas of non contact. 9) The blood marks were formed by contact with the cloth. 10) The image was formed by bodily contact with the cloth, and also by some form of emission resulting in action at a distance, collimated by the dust covering the surface of the body. 11) Finally the whole assemblage was wrapped in the Sudarium of Kornelimunster and placed in the burial chamber. I hope Max feels that I have represented him correctly, and that others find this description more coherent than previous attempts. My questions are: 1) Can we have some sources for the idea that any of this was typical Jewish burial practice? 2) What is ‘Red Heifer water’? 3) What does ‘fumigated on both sides’ [first on one side and then on he other side] mean? 4) What was the nature of the emission from the body to produce the action at a distance represented by the intensity differences on the Shroud? 3) How did the dust on the body collimate the emission?

So, I disagree with almost everything you have said, which has, again, made no attempt to explain how an “energy beam” can be collimated by dust, even a ” DUST (urea residue) blood COVERED body like membrane shroud.” I note that you begin your attempt to explain your ideas with eight bullet points which have nothing whatever to do with either the beam or the dust. Then we get “you not only took at face value the few optical metaphors (bent & planar mirror, scan)”. Oh! So all that stuff about lenses was a metaphor! But a metaphor for what? For “the energy receiving re emitting textile surface in light of the body to cloth initial and final configurations!” Well that sounds great, Max, but it doesn’t mean anything, does it? You’ll have to be a lot clearer than that. You seem to rely a lot of Bruno Azzola’s paper, which I am completely unable to access. Googling him in an attempt to find out more, all I get is from the BSTS Newsletter on Shroud.com. “J. Bruno Azzola, “A Possible Image Transfer Mechanism on the Shroud of Turin.” The Author, a Roumanian engineer working in West Germany (or perhaps a translator) has made a valiant attempt to write in English. Scientists familiar with what the Author is talking about may be able to figure it out.” Now, I hold up my hands here. I don’t know what his ideas are. But don’t now jump up and down in glee shouting “Go and do your homework” as usual. I’m absolutely certainly you don’t know what he’s talking about either, so would you like to explain? Next, “I personally made two attempts in 1994 and 1997.” Yes, so you said before. But you didn’t say what you did or what the results were. That’s not an explanation at all. And what, finally, is the energy beam? It’s “a collimated/ body shaped like vaporographic beam of energy resulting from fumigation of the alkaline water in soaked inner winding burial sheet (aka TS) moulded around the body front and back.” Oh, dearie me, Max. What on earth is a “vaporographic beam of energy”? In short, Max, hurling neologisms around is not the same thing as explaining something. What was the “vaporographic beam of energy” made of?

Complicated stuff. It is possible to dispute the indisputable? Or is the term indisputable entirely subjective, so that although A considers something indisputable, B is entirely at liberty to dispute it without there being a logical contradiction? “The Shroud of Turin already has proved, beyond reasonable doubt, Christ’s physical resurrection and therefore that Christianity is true.” For Stephen, this is indisputable, and therefore, for him, any attempt to dispute it is the mark of those who “don’t like the implications of there being scientific proof that Christianity is true.” Trouble is, however solid his axiom is for him, it is an airy nothing for others, both Christians (like myself) and Non Christians. Even if I were convinced (“beyond reasonable doubt”) that the Shroud image was derived directly from the crucified Christ, I would not consider that it proves, or even suggests, the veracity of the Resurrection, nor that “Christianity is true” (whatever that really means). The scientific truth of Christianity does not depend on, nor is supported by, an authenticist interpretaton of the Shroud. Jason has interesting things to say about miracles, and I think his comments very sensible, for a given definition of the word miracles. My objection to the scientific investigation of miracles in a supernatural sense is that there are no parameters within which such an investigation can be made. If the yellowing of the cloth was caused by a miracle, then it is fatuous to bother with the precise direction or intensity of the radiation which might have caused it, as any or all values are equally valid. There was a thernonuclear explosion which only affected the Shroud? Well, why not? There was a faint exhalation of postmortem vapour? Well, why not? With a miracle, all things are possible. However I do enjoy his request that, although believers in miracles have nothing to investigate, the non believers continue their work, on the grounds that the less successful they are, the more the supernatural hypothesis is strengthened. This is also the reasoning behind John Klotz’s quoting Sherock Holmes: “When you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Needless to say, I don’t think natural causes for the image of the shroud have been eliminated as impossible. I don’t even think a 13th or 14th century origin for the Shroud has been eliminated as impossible. I certainly don’t agree that “All explanations for the image have failed, and must be eliminated.” Finally, there is a grain of truth in Stephen’s insistence that if something ought to have been discovered but hasn’t been, then that is evidence that it wasn’t there in the first place. I just don’t think it applies to the Shroud. In spite of many years of interest, there has been very little systematic effort to duplicate the Shroud image making mechanism. Such attempts as have been made, Vignon’s (pro authenticity) and Garlaschelli’s (anti authenticity) being perhaps the most promising so far , have all been little more than first steps along a possible path of investigation rather than thorough explorations of the underlying hypotheses..","date":"2014-04-01","mins":"10:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/01/the-shroud-that-defies-scientific-explanation-part-2/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud that Defies Scientific Explanation (Part 2)"},{"id":"comment-149278","author":"hugh_farey","post":"We have been looking at similarities (or supposed similarities) between the Manoppello veil and the Shroud quite recently, and a quick search through this blog will show you both sides of the argument quite well.

Some, I’ve no doubt began as deliberate cynical ploys to extract money from the gullible, but others began as illustrations, some, as OK says above, were honest copies, and some were certified on the basis of possibility rather than certainly. A wooden beam in Jerusalem: a piece of the cross; it’s not impossible. Having gained acceptance, however, there is no reason to suppose that the vast majority of ecclesiastical relic traders were dishonest or insincere, and the more ecclesiastical hands through which a relic passed the more certification it acquired, until its original provenance was wholly irrelevant. I do think OK makes a good point about respecting the heritage of these things.

I’m not sure the “my expert is bigger than your expert” argument is very helpful, and it maybe that both experts (as opposed to both bloggers) would agree with each other. It is surely true that perhaps 90% of all weaving is simple over and under 1 1 weave. This requires only a single heddle, which either raises or depresses alternate warp threads. 3 1 twill requires four heddles, alternately raising every fourth warp thread, and is indisputably more complicated. Whether it has a herringbone pattern or not is a feature of how the threads are set up on the heddles and, once set up, is no more complicated to make than ‘ordinary’ twill. The exact proportion of twill to 1 1 is not particularly relevant – there is a lot of cloth made, and even 1% would not, I think be considered terribly rare, although it would certainly be less than common. It may be that it was more expensive than ordinary cloth and has been disproportionately preserved. I’m afraid that I find the idea that there is no 3 1 herringbone twill from the 13th century anywhere in Europe difficult to credit. However it may be very rare, and I can well understand nobody wanting to lose any of it, even a (large) postage stamp size, just to act as a control. After all, the shroud would only be the most valuable cloth in creation if it was the genuine article, and there would be no guarantee of that before the control was destroyed. Another reason may be that by 13th century samples of fabric are complete articles rather than fragmentary, and chopping any sample off would damage them beyond tolerance. I note the complaint that Wilson’s word “unusual” is graced with a [sic] by Weaving Fan. However it is an odd word. What, I wonder, is ‘usual’ about the shroud? How many similar shrouds are there to compare it to before anything about it can be considered either usual or unusual? I think I would need half a dozen or so before I could class one of them as “unusual.” Having said that, Weaving Fan is being slightly disingenuous in his quote from Raes: “The type of weave is not particularly distinctive…” The paragraph from which it is taken begins: “At the beginning of our age both cotton and linen were known in the Middle East.” It is clear that here Raes is speaking of antiquity rather than the Middle Ages. Finally, and on a slightly different tack, and I don’t even know if it’s important, but on one side of a twill the warp threads dominate the visible area, and on the other side the weft.

However, the same paragraph goes on later to say that “Heller and Adler have since postulated that the calcium and strontium were absorbed into the linen during the retting process”. The retting process has been used a convenient source of so many anomalies of the Shroud that 1st century linen seems to have been steeped in a kind of mineralogical soup, carefully composed of whatever ingredients need to be accounted for.

I have always thought Charles was grasping at straws to suggest that a loincloth was painted on and stripped off as occasion demanded, although that is not wholly impossible (it could even have been appliquéd on for that matter), especially as that feature does not explain the similarly sporadic appearance of the crown of thorns and the different arrangement of the legs and feet, but he does have a point in his insistence that all those depictions of a loin clothed, crowned image must have derived from something. I even suggested a while back that there may have been two shrouds, the real one and a display copy, although that was grasping at straws on my part. However if the ‘publication’ version was not an actual copy, but a kind of list of required characteristics which an artist had to include, either written or sketched by the ‘nihil obstat’ and ‘imprimatur’ authorities as required, that might be a realistic compromise..","date":"2015-12-12","mins":"6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-215768","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well, either it was or it wasn’t.

The lententuch of Zittau, which had several panels obliterated by being used as a sauna canopy, of course has degrees of obliteration, but none of the panels is completely free of the original paint. You can see them in detail at http://www.zittau.eu/fastentuecher/grosses fastentuch bild.htm. The same applies to every old eroded picture I can find. If Charles is correct, which is still possible, then I think there must have been a deliberate, and successful, attempt to erase all traces of the original paint, by washing, rubbing or whatever. Maybe it did begin to erode away, exposing the ‘negative’ underneath, and a decision was made to erase the superficial pigment completely, but I find it difficult to accept that not a shred of paint would remain anywhere simply as a result of continuous usage. Pursuing Charles’s loincloth idea, the particular sensibilities of Charles Borromeo, and that extraordinary dichotomy of depiction (either crowned, loin clothed and with feet apart, or uncrowned, naked and with feet together) I wonder if there wasn’t a ‘standard form’ for public depiction, set down by the church authorities, which all painters were commanded to adhere to, regardless of whether they knew what the shroud image actually looked like or not. Actual copies of the Shroud – ex extractum – could, of course, be as close to the original as the artists could make, but the engravers of ceremonial occasions had to produce the ‘official’ version, which they knew, and no doubt many of those who saw it knew, was more of a symbol of the image than a depiction of the image itself..","date":"2015-12-12","mins":"6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-215775","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I see your point, Mario, but I think it is Colin’s contention (and I agree with him) that if anybody at all knew what the image actually looked like, it would have become common knowledge, or at least common legend. “It would have leaked”, says Colin, and I think he’s right..","date":"2015-12-07","mins":"5:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216594","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Can you suggest any “genuine Second Temple period Jewish scholars” of which you approve, Max?
