There is no dispute that the Shroud is unique, from whatever century it comes. If I were to say that the Shroud could not possibly be accepted as 1st century unless you could provide another one, you would be rightly indignant. This is a variant on the “if you don’t know how it was done then I must be right” argument, which, as we have seen many times before, works equally well for both sides. Similarly, a statement like this: “I’ve learned one thing – Shroud skeptics will always remain like that, no matter what kind of evidence pointing otherwise will be presented. Although they claim to be searching the truth, the only «truth» for them are their own claims,” is surely a two edged sword and benefits nobody. If I were to reword it slightly as follows: “I’ve learned one thing – Shroud authenticists will always remain like that, no matter what kind of evidence pointing otherwise will be presented. Although they claim to be searching the truth, the only «truth» for them are their own claims,” would I be any less correct? I believe that if the radiocarbon dating were ever seriously challenged, non authenticists in droves would change their minds (and I mean seriously challenged in the minds of the non authenticists, not in the minds of those who didn’t believe in it anyway). And what about this: “those who want to distract us from the truth”? Who are these people? How do they know what the truth is, so they can distract people from it? Some of the most passionate discussions on this site have been between fellow authenticists – is the Shroud the same as the Mandylion or not?

I have already discussed some of the evidence which casts doubt on the idea that the Shroud’s image was ever clearly defintiive, in the form of the hopelessly variable inaccuracies of the numerous depictions of it (November 6, 2014 at 4:23 am). However I don’t go along with the idea that the blood is as clear now as it ever was. It is obvious to me that most of it has flaked off, leaving minute fragments jammed into the interstices of the threads. It’s pinkness is another unusual feature that I have not found adequately explained by any natural phenomenon. The ‘red bilirubin’ hypotheses or the idea that blood stays red when applied to saponaria are currently unconvincing, partially because although easy to confirm, no photos of the many experiments claimed to have been carried out seem to have been taken, which I would have thought were a sine qua non. So if blood can flake off, why not paint? Well, I find it odd that not a single flake remains, but then I wonder what we’re looking for? Walter Mc Crone painted a variety of cloths with iron oxide, which, as I have found out for myself, doesn’t form flakes. Nor, I suppose would other pigments. They are minutely particulate. If they were, by accident or design, inadequately fixed because of inappropriate binder, then, like the blood, they might be reduced to a rather thin covering, mostly jammed between the fibres or threads, rather as Mc Crone claimed to have discovered. I would need someone experienced in medieval art to help before I speculate much further down that line of exploration. Another reason why all the paint could have fallen off would be that it formed really big flakes (glued together by gesso?) maybe the size of a fingernail. After a fair number of these had fallen off with age, rendering the Shroud distictly patchy but with an unforseen under image, it would be a simple job to complete the job with a fingernail!

I really don’t know!.","date":"2014-11-07","mins":"4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"id":"comment-168841","author":"hugh_farey","post":"David Mo’s quick sketch works very well from both the negative and the 3 D point of view (on image J, for example).

It’s difficult to tell which of the illustrations are eye witness copies, and which are copies of copies (in which case the inaccuracies could be accurately preserved) but some of them were presumably made by people who sketched the image in front of them, or from sketches made by people who were looking at it as they sketched.

My answer, as you probably expected, is that I have no idea what the image was like, as the evidence, as so often with the Shroud, is conflicting! Charles is certainly correct to say that contemporary accounts go on and on about how fresh the bloodstains are, in particular, and how clearly the image is depicted, which, if they are to be taken at face value, simply cannot correspond with the image as we see it today. However, as I have suggested above, actual copies of the Shroud, however sharply depicted, are so different that it is difficult to believe that the artists had actually discerned anything clearly at all. I think what it will come down to is not a pile of actual eveidence – descriptions and paintings – on each side of the argument, but a more nuanced discussion as to what each describer or artist was putting into his recreation. The Lier copy is often considered one of the oldest and one of the most accurate depictions of the Shroud pre 1532. Some details are more accurate than many other copies or depictions from much later – so why did the artist get the shape of the head so wrong, miss out most of the very visible bloodstains altogether, draw three clear strands of hair spreading over the back of the head, and over accentuate the darkness of the hair and buttocks. Is that what he saw? People who think the Shroud was as it is now, and quote the Lier copy as their ‘proof’ have an obligation to explain these anomalies. Perhaps the Lier painter saw, but omitted the blood for reasons of his own. People who use the Lier copy to suggest that the Shroud was different still have to account for alterations, such as the shape of the head or the absence of blood, which cannot be due to the paint falling off. The much derided Picknett and Prince used the Lier shroud to ‘prove’ that the one we see now cannot have been the one the Lier artist painted, which was destroyed and replaced, much later, by Leonardo da Vinci. On the basis of that evidence alone it would be difficult to gainsay them. Similarly, pious descriptions of the Shroud can either be taken as forensically accurate or imaginative reconstructions. Anyone who saw what he believed was really his saviour’s face on a cloth, in contrast to the many paintings he had seen, might well feel, quite sincerely, that it was brighter than it was, but on the other hand it is strange that nobody at all seems to have recorded that the image was actually barely visible – a strange case of the emperor’s new clothes!

Uncertainties there certainly are, and I have been attempting to understand his methodology to try to clarify them. Two particular difficulties are his unrealistic identification of his pollen right down to species level, and the unrealistic proportions of the various types of plant identified. I think his main problem was the lack of reference material with which to compare the grains he found. To counter this, he went several times to collect reference material from places he thought might be relevant. Now this next bit is speculation, but I think he then compared his grains with the reference material collected, and where he found a match, identified the pollen as from that species. This is a mistake. Pollen is not as individually shaped as he thought, and even today very few grains can be identified at species level; the family is as good as most palynologists can get, and families of plants are much more widely distributed, of course, than species. I think that had Frei gone to, say, South America or Japan for his reference specimens, he would have had no less difficulty in finding 50 or so matches, even though the list of species would have been entirely different! This scenario could also account for the unrealistic proportions of types of plants, as it is easier to collect pollen from a brightly coloured flower (entomophilous) than from an undistinguished, possibly difficult to find, even difficult to reach, catkin (wind borne), and plants from the same family can include both types..","date":"2014-08-01","mins":"10:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/28/a-new-paper-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A New Paper by Paul Maloney"},{"id":"comment-206276","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The Wikipedia article on Tekton discusses the possibility that it could be a translation of the word naggar.

The secularity of these plays seems to have been stimulated by Pope Innocent III’s edict against clergy acting on a public stage in 1210.

Paintings which are clearly copies of the Shroud show the body without, then with, then without. They are pretty variable about which hand crossed over which, the position of the feet, and the details of the bloodflows as well. Either the artists were relying on the reports or sketches of others, or these details were not important enough to be correctly reported, or sensibility to convention made them ‘get it wrong.’ I think Charles’s point here is that the loincloth only occurs at a particular time in the Shroud’s history, and then only (by coincidence) when there was a particular taboo against ecclesiastical nudity. Such temporary additions were quite common – the loincloth could have been deliberately made temporary and easy to remove – it could even have been a separate piece of material stitched on – or could have only appeared in artists’ copies and depictions of the expositions. “Why would someone paint a negative image?” This is a reasonable question and, as far as I know, there are no other negative images of this sort in existence today. There are also no other double portraits of Christ, head to head, on long thin sheets. However, as Charles has pointed out, there was at some point quite an extensive tradition of re enactment of the Quem Quaeritis scene from the bible, numerous accounts of which survive, all of which involved a shroud which was taken from a symbolic tomb and exhibited to the congregation. There must have been dozens of shrouds, not one of which survives, except possibly the Shroud of Turin. Perhaps some of the others also depicted the image of Christ, and perhaps they too showed him as accurately as they could, leaving marks where his body touched the cloth, but not where it didn’t. Sure, it’s a guess, but it’s not an unreasonable one. Some years ago, Picknett and Prince published the idea that the Shroud was a photo by Leonardo da Vinci. They were mostly criticised, with similar abuse to that above, for being so stupid as to attribute a cloth well known in 1355, to a man who was born in 1452. Even a cursory glance at their research would have shown that they claimed the modern Shroud was a copy of the original, but few of their intemperate opponents seem to have read much more than the back cover. As it happens I think their theory is incorrect, but I did read it all the way through. Before anybody else starts usng words like “absurd,” “bad will,” and “plagiarism,” for Charles, might I suggest they respond to what his article says rather than what they think it might say based on an abstract. For me, the value of Charles’s paper is that he suggests a context, with which I was not familiar, within which the Shroud could have fitted, and which must have involved numerous similar shrouds with which it could be compared. What we need to do now is to find some!.","date":"2014-10-18","mins":"3:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"id":"comment-163731","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Although neither Herbert Thurston nor Ulysse Chevalier thought that the Shroud was authentic, and both used the D’Arcis letters as evidence against authenticity, I think they differed quite sharply about what it actually was. Chevalier, I think, had an anti relic agenda to foster, and was keen to prove that the Shroud had indeed been designed to deceive people into thinking it was genuine when it wasn’t, but Thurston was much more directed towards the use of artifacts in the Easter Liturgy, and, as Charles has suggested, thought the Shroud was one of those. However, I have thought of a bit of a problem with Charles’s thesis. If ‘shrouds’ were part of a common annual liturgy, stored in their dozens in sacristies across Europe, how come ‘our’ Shroud suddenly appears as an object of special reverence? Was it brought from an area where the ‘Quem Quaeritis’ ceremony was common to a place where it was wholly unknown? Or had the ritual declined for years, and most of the old impedimenta discarded, and the Shroud resurfaced after a period of dormancy? If the Shroud was part of a ‘Quem Quaeritis’ ceremony, however, the famous ‘poker holes’ become much easier to understand. The ritual specifically states that three clergy, all swinging censors, go to the symbolic tomb, lift out the cloth, return it to the altar and unfold it for all to revere. The folding of the coth into four (to fit in the ‘tomb’), and the possibility of scattered charcoal, seem to fit this scenario rather well. I’m looking for Thomas’s and OK’s ‘number of flaws’ to Charles’s article, as this is how good scientists test their own, as well as others’, hypotheses. But what a pity. The most forceful of their arguments is that the article is ‘garbage,’ ‘rubbish,’ and deliberate lies (Or as OK puts it, LIES, and in bold too). I note that Thomas has ‘little time for non thinking authenticists.’ Generous to a fault, I continued the search and I have found something less abusive. First there is the loincloth issue, as mentioned above. Charles is apparently attempting to reconcile the coincidence of a loincloth enveloped shroud with eccesiastical views about nudity. If the loinclothed shroud and the prohibition are indeed contemporaneous, and if the shroud is always depicted nude outside the period of prohibition, then a valid connection can be made between them. If the actual Shroud were exhibited at that time, then it would have had to be covered itself, just as any representation of it would have to be. Furthermore, Thomas’s implication that copies of the exposition would have to have a loincoth (‘because that was the artistic convention, being highly distasteful to show Christ’s buttocks’) but not the Shroud itself, publicly exposed to thousands, is inconsistent. Thomas’s contention that “the fact that the earliest depiction of the Shroud – Lier in 1516 – does not show a loin cloth, is close to fatal for his theory” is clearly wrong, as it is entirely consistent with a loincloth being added later, and a clear demonstration that it was not always ‘highly distasteful to show Christ’s buttocks’. Secondly, Thomas queries the inconsistency between the very visible artistic representations of the image, and the near invisibility of the image itself. Is this because of artistry, and the difficulty of showing the true image on a painting/engraving, or because the image really was much clearer in earlier times? This is a difficult question. Some authenticists think that the image has actually got clearer over the years, ‘developing’ like a photograph, and some non authenticists think that the image was clearly painted (or photographed), but that the paint or other medium has flaked off, leaving only the deteriorated linen behind. One way of finding out is to read what people said they saw, rather than looking at artistic representations. As far as I can recall, almost all pre 20th century accounts say how clear and distinct the image is, adding some evidence in favour of Charles’s view. He quotes some of them in his article. O.K., eventually, having firmly nailed his colours to the ‘I don’t care what he says; I don’t like him so he must be wrong’ mast, finally gets round to disputing Charles description of the images on the shroud, which is a valid criticism. All the measurements of the images are imprecise, inconsistencies between the front and the back are variously accounted for the posture of the body and the wrapping of the cloth, and similar problems arise in attempting to correlate the measurements of the image with the measurements of the man who might have made it. Latendre, above, makes the point well. However, since the time of Vignon and Barbet, who saw only perfect proportions to the body, even the most ardent authenticists have found themselves having to account for observed inconsistencies, and those non authenticists who think they can all be accounted for by clumsy artistry, have greatly enoyed watching them wriggle. It is not inconsistent with Charles’s argument to claim that the Shroud does not obviously show a perfectly proportioned body, or pair of bodies..","date":"2014-10-19","mins":"6:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"id":"comment-202930","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Quite so, Nabber.

(I’ve been Googling) From newspaper reports, it is usually very difficult to tell whether a ‘scientific discovery’ is anything of the sort, and a couple of articles entitled ‘Noah’s Ark found in Turkey’ or ‘Shroud is genuine say scientists’ are equally likely to be so clumsily reported that to rely on them to formulate one’s opinion is extremely unwise. The reader is more likely to be persuaded by previous prejudice or the reputation of the media than anything claimed in the article. So, what to do? I turn to things like Google Scholar to see what I can find. For “Turin Shroud” the first dozen or so entries include papers from Applied Optics, the Journal of Optics, Accounts of Chemical Research, and the Journal of Imaging Science and Technology. For “Noah’s Ark” there is virtually nothing. Nearly all the ‘science’ of the Shroud can be found online, in accounts by its researchers and discoverers. All the ‘science’ of Noah’s Ark is second hand and primary sources are very difficult to track down. Be that as it may, I discovered something else, which is that the discovery of Noah’s Ark has been the subject of a court case. How often have books on the Shroud, or comments on this blog, included fanciful ideas involving ‘trials’, ‘judgements’ or ‘verdicts’? Well, in 1997, Noah’s Ark was actually subject to judicial proceedings. A professor of geology sued a lecturer for misrepresenting the discovery of Noah’s Ark as fact, when it was no such thing. Sadly, in spite of various arguments for and against, the lecturer’s lectures were not considered as “Trading” under the provisions of the “Fair Trade Act,” so he was not able to have breached it, regardless of the content of what he said, although the judge did say that the lecturer has used “misleading and deceptive conduct” in claiming various scientific truths which were no such thing..","date":"2015-07-23","mins":"7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/because-if-it-looks-unbelievable/","cat":"article","title":"Because If It Looks Unbelievable"},{"id":"comment-198372","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Of course I could, Max, but I don’t choose to.

You’re drifting further and further away from sense, let alone truth. Let’s recap. 1) Your hypothesis is that Bishop d’Arcis used the word ‘depinxerat’ to mean ‘he had copied from one image to another’ even though there is no instance of the word ever being used in that sense elsewhere. 2) Your hypothesis is that Bishop d’Arcis used the word in that unique sense because an available word; ‘copio, copiare’ had no perfect or pluperfect form in 1390. However your evidence for this was a reference to a different word altogether, the deponent verb ‘copior, copiari.’ I understood that, and found your hypothesis fanciful and your evidence erroneous. Now I get confused. First you say you have found ‘copiavi’ and ‘copiavit’, forms of the perfect tense of ‘copio’ in connection with the 14th century Pope Urban V, and in the following sentence “NO pluperfect active indicative of the verb copiare, NO perfect and pluperfect active indicatives of the medieval Latin verb copio, “to reproduce, to copy” appears then.” Surely ‘copiavi’ and ‘copiavit’ are indeed forms of the perfect active indicative of the verb ‘copio, copiare, copiavi, copiatum’. Finally, you say: “The Latin verb copio, “to copy” as synonym of copiare does exist”, and link to a page about the verb ‘copio, copiare’ as if you thought the two words were synonyms, rather than different forms of the same word, ‘copio’ being the 1st person present indicative and ‘copiare’ the present infinitive. ‘Copio’ means ‘I copy’ and ‘copiare’ means ‘to copy’. I think the bottom line is that if d’Arcis had wished to say that one shroud was a copy of another there were conventional ways of doing so other than the unique use of the word ‘depinxerat’, and the fact that he did use the word ‘depinxerat’ indicates that he did not wish to say any such thing..","date":"2015-05-06","mins":"1:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198446","author":"hugh_farey","post":"And I’ve just checked your last link, which conjugates the verb ‘copio’ without its ‘i’ throughout as ‘copo, copas, copat’ etc. This is because the endings of the verb have been calculated by a computer, and cannot be relied upon as accurate reflections of usage..","date":"2015-05-06","mins":"1:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198008","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Quite possibly..","date":"2015-04-30","mins":"9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198459","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Excellent.

Not mentioning dates and times, witnesses, theologians, artists etc. And not having documents one way or the other is not good evidence for anything, but daveb is right that the praise we do have by Henri of Poitiers of Geoffroy de Charnay does seem incongruous.

It is apparent, as I think you agree, that copio, copiare, copiavi, copiatum existed as a regular verb in medieval times. The perfect stem ‘copiav ‘ has been attested by yourself in connection with Pope Urban V, an Avignon Pope approximately contemoprary to the correspondence between d’Arcis and another Avignon Pope a few years later. It is not necessary to find an actual example of every form of a verb for it to be ‘available’ for use if required. In the entire internet, nobody has ever used the form “we will have Googled”, but the form has been listed several times in computer generated lists of possible forms of the verb to Google. I do not agree that “he had copied” was of “extremely current use” nor that it should necessarily have been. If people had wanted to say “he had copied” they would have said it, in one way or another, either using copiaverat or some other word, but in fact neither alternative is found. In all medieval Latin literature there is no reference to a painting having been copied by a copyist using any translation of “he had copied”. Your last post is muddled. D’Arcis and the Pope thought the Shroud of Lirey was a representation of the true shroud of Christ, not the actual thing. It was not a copy or a reproduction of the real shroud, as there was no original from which to copy it, but an reconstruction of what the real shroud might have been like. You are misleading in claiming that the Latin word ‘representatio’ means ‘copy’ or reproduction,’ without recognising its primary meaning as ‘representation.’ The first two imply a physical original from which a copy or reproduction may be made, but the primary meaning does not require such an original, and may as well derive from a description.

However it must be said that various full size sheets with at least some resemblance to the Shroud have been produced by painting (Nickell himself), photography (Allen and Wilson) and acid degradation (Garlaschelli), while nothing more than a couple of centimetres has been produced by vaporography (Vignon), lasers (di Lazzaro), or coronal discharge (Fanti). Attempts to upscale these experiments have either failed completely, or not attempted because the energy required would be outside the realm of science. 2) “The Rev. Andrew Dalton, a Legionaries of Christ priest who’s a shroud expert.” Why? What makes one a Shroud Expert? What makes Dalton’s suggestions more credible than anybody else’s? I’m not just carping; it’s important, because this is what he says: 3) “There are details that simply couldn’t have been forged centuries ago. Dalton describes the shroud as the ‘natural effect of a supernatural event.’ ” On what evidence? Just being an Expert? 4) “Dalton also insists that the samples dating to the Middle Ages were taken from patches added to the cloth after it was damaged by a fire, and he said that other experts caution that ancient cloths often date later in radiocarbon analysis than their actual origins due to bacterial contamination.” This could just be clumsy reporting, but I do hope Dalton insists no such thing. However I like the way the reporter has summarised both Nickell’s and Barrie Schwortz’s points, especially: Nickell: “The “blood” has failed a battery of tests by internationally known forensic serologists.” Schwortz: “The bloodstains were chemically tested and determined to be actual blood.” Both, of course, perfectly true statements, and wholly contradictory, like so much of the evidence of the Shroud.

If the Shroud was not “supposed” to have anything on it, then surely painting anything on one, even a theatrical prop, would have been unnecessary and confusing. On the other hand, a Shroud with a smudgy, vague image would not have been considered particularly miraculous, but simply a possible result of a body lying in it. That would do well as a stage prop, and transfer well, I think, to being considered original, if there was some extraneous reason to do so. I don’t think the image itself was considered particularly miraculous, especially as the various Veils of Veronica were so much more impressive. But as Charles says, there may have been a healing miracle or some such associated with it. On the other hand…. (Lots of hands…) If Henry of Poitiers did not denounce the Shroud as a fraud, why was it put away for 20 or 30 years before re emerging in the 1380s?.","date":"2015-05-04","mins":"4:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198272","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Er… no… No gentleman has made any reference as to the status of the d’Arcis memorandum, nor claimed that it was dispatched at all.

The evidence that either bishop was lying is that a hundred years later the same Shroud was now claimed to be genuine (and all the evidence since 1900 so interpreted). The evidence that the bishops were not lying comes from the fact that as soon as both of them had made their investigations, exhibition of the Shroud was, indeed, suppressed, as they wished (and all the evidence since 1900 so interpreted)..","date":"2015-05-04","mins":"6:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198289","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I don’t think that “not made by human hands” described a technique, rather than an artist.

Lewis and Short, those heroes of our youth, very helpfully give dozens of references for the two words, many of which can be checked in context. While depingere almost certainly means to “paint from,” the sense of “copy” as of one image to another, is wholly absent in all them. It means, as its derivation does now, “depict.” If representing a person or scene onto a flat surface is copying, then I am happy for you to use the word in that sense, but it is some way removed from the idea that the Shroud complained about by d’Arcis was a copy of another Shroud..","date":"2015-05-05","mins":"7:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198349","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, of course I can, Max; it’s a pleasure.

My point is that the word ‘scientist’ can be used as term of adulation or abuse somewhat indiscriminately, and has come to mean virtually nothing. Scientist is what scientist does in, my opinion, and although even Colin would admit that to a layman, a bloke in a kitchen smearing flour on his face seems very different from a bloke in a university laboratory with a squillion volt laser, it seems that both these gentlemen have achieved a discolouration of the upper fibrils of a cloth which at least visually, even under a microscope, has many of the characteristics of the Shroud. Daveb’s gentle ribbing of Colin’s work by saying that there is no idea so preposterous that some scientist doesn’t promote it is fair enough, but we must remember that this swings both ways. John Jackson has impeccable scientific credentials, but his current attempts at explaining the ‘fall through’ hypothesis make Colin’s experiments appear the very essence of respectability. Bob Brockie, who ought to have known better, made the popular journalist error of describing anyone who uses the words ‘quantum’, ‘hologram, or even ‘UFO’ as, by definition a scientist. To the best of my knowledge Isabel Piczek has been a working artist since she left Hungary at the age of 14. A couple of years ago I wrote on this site: “None of her papers on shroud.com are physics based, and a question and answer article entitled “Isobel Piczek, Artist and Physicist” makes no mention at all of any science. A paper entitled ‘The Event Horizon of the Shroud of Turin’ on shroud3d.com shows no understanding of particle physics or quantum theory, or even of the meaning of event horizon.” I have had no reason to change this since.

Until his last post Louis was claiming that archaeologists said that: “one in every ten ossuaries in Israel is said to have the inscription, “Jesus, son of Joseph.” This was, no doubt unintentionally, completely untrue. For ‘ossuaries’ we should read ‘tombs’ and there is a very important difference, statistically, as we shall see. According to Pfann, in “Demythologyzing the Talpiot Tomb” (http://www.uhl.ac/files/9813/4840/4067/Talpiot Tomb Analysis SJP3a.pdf), in an “overall census of inscribed ossuaries” there were 286 names, of which 10 were Jesus and 19 were Joseph. For reasons unexplained, Pfann reduces the 286 total to 214, which is the total number of the most numerous 16 names. Of the 214, 144 are male and 70 are female. This gives 7% called Jesus and 13% called Joseph. Assuming the two names are unconnected, the probability of being a “Jesus, son of Joseph” is 7% x 13% which is roughly 1%. However, since a tomb might be said to have an average of ten ossuaries in it, the probability that a tomb contains a “Jesus, son of Joseph” is back to 10%. One in ten. Actually the reduction of 286 to 214 is not justified. Assuming a similar proportion of males to females though, there would be a total of 196 males and 90 females, and thence 5% Jesus and 10% Joseph, and (if we may still assume 10 ossuaries per tomb), a probability of there being a Jesus son of Joseph actually more like 5% than 10%. Of course, some tombs were built to contain up to 16 ossuaries, and some ossuaries contained bones from more than one body, so these figures can be juggled a bit to suit, but at least we have laid to rest the idea that 10% of the male population of Israel were ‘Jesus son of Joseph.’.","date":"2015-04-07","mins":"5:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"id":"comment-195694","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Why?

Your erroneous comment was, I am absolutely certain, more of a ‘mental typo’ than what you seriously thought, and your basic point, that the inscriptions on the Talpiot ossuaries do not statistically amount to convincing evidence that Christ was buried there, is entirely valid. In future, in the unlikely event that some rank amateur such as myself or daveb has the temerity to challenge any more of your work, it would be good to check exactly what he is questioning, and explain exactly why his question is invalid, before trying to fob him off with persiflage.

However, there are a few who seem to think that, having convincing evidence of the Shroud’s inauthenticity, then any counter evidence can be rejected without being considered on its own merits. Joe Nickell seems to be doing it here. He cannot be accused of ignoring counter evidence, but his conclusions give me the impression that he rejects it ‘because it must be false’, and not because of its internal inconsistencies. If the Shroud is not authentic, then he is correct that it is false, but anyone interested in getting to the bottom of the mystery would surely want to find out why. One of Joe’s arguments is that “A secret commission appointed in 1969 to study the shroud examined the “blood” stains, which are suspiciously picturelike and still red. Internationally known forensic serologists reported that the red substance failed all microscopical, chemical, biological, and instrumental tests for blood. Instead, there were reddish granules that would not even dissolve in reagents that dissolve blood.” He knows very well that as long as the reddish granules did not dissolve, then of course all the tests for blood would fail. What he ignores here is that the 1978 scientists did manage to dissolve the reddish granules, and performed a number of tests which they said indicated the presence of blood. Some sort of discussion is required to resolve this apparent contradiction, but Joe does not engage in it. On the other hand, Leon is not doing the authenticist cause any favours by spouting the old “if you can’t do it your way, it must have been done my way” mantra..","date":"2015-04-25","mins":"8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"id":"comment-197701","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Interesting, David.

It is not surprising that some of the pollen resembles that of plants that bloom in Spring, as most plants do. What is more surprising is the pollen that comes from plants that bloom in autumn. 2) Prof. Danin has also identified the imprints of a number of plants on the Shroud, most notably Chrysanthemum coronarium, and ‘an almost continuous carpet of flowers […] most similar in shape and size to flowering heads of Matricaria recutita or Anthemis bornmuelleri.’ None of these is represented in his pollen list. 3) As most of the pollen is entomophilous, it must have arrived by the flowers being placed on the Shroud. There is very sparse archaeological evidence that this was common practice, no biblical suggestion that any such thing occurred, and gives us an interesting vision of various holy people rushing around the environs of Jerusalem to gather about 20 different species of flowers, some of which only grow on the shores of the Dead Sea, and most of which are extremely unattractive.

What’s more, I have read what Heller and Adler published in Applied Optics in 1980. “Thermodynamically the latter fibrils would be expected to show the spectrum of a fully oxidized denatured met hemoglobin, i.e., a so called perturbed acid met hemoglobin. Although the spectra of the Shroud fibrils are, in fact, indicative of such a spectrum, the high degree of scattering from these solid samples makes the visible band shape features less distinct and does produce peak shifts from the solution spectra. Therefore, this identification is much less positive than desired.” I made no attempt to denigrate Heller’s work, and certainly not to demean him. I simply wanted to point out that overweening confidence in any of the scientific findings on the Shroud is invariably unjustified, and usually hedged with caution even by the discoverers themselves.

It is a review of some microspectrum photometry carried out on “less than a dozen possible bloodstained fibrils and a single brownish red translucent crystal.” The first mention of bilirubin in connection with the Shroud seems to be in ‘A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin’, Heller and Adler, 1981. “Characteristic blue azobilirubin colors could be positively detected in reflected light on the surfaces of the olive coloured shards, the orange globs, and, also, weakly on the more orange colored red coated fibrils.” The redder coloured fibrils are specifically excluded from this analysis. Another roughly contemporaneous paper, “The Origin and Nature of Blood on the Turin Shroud”, which I can only find in ‘The Orphaned Manuscript”, goes in more detail into the bilirubin content, based on the microspectrum photometry previously mentioned. “There is an extraordinarily high bilirubin count, almost as high as the methemoglobin.” There is no explanation of how this was derived, and it is not apparent to me, after studying the spectrum as illustrated in the 1980 paper.

Perhaps the majority of the authenticists agree that whether by nuclear, electromagnetic or other radiation, or by vapour emission, the transmission of image from body to cloth was almost exactly vertically up or down, and not perpendicular to the body, or to the cloth, or any halfway stage between. This is in order to explain not the minor irregularities of the face, but the complete absence of anything representing the flanks or sides of the legs, and also the precision of the features and the mathematical intensity distance relationship, which requires collimated emission to make any sense at all. Giovanna de Liso’s discoveries regarding earthquake images are in need of verification, but there is precious little else scientific that bears credence. In his paper, OK attempts to demonstrate that the Shroud shows a minor version of the Agamemnon face effect, by manipulating the width of the face to fit his hypothesis. On Page 17 (“Let’s compare the results”) he says that by removing the weave and the banding, the Shroud face appears wider. Actually it appears wider because it has been stretched sideways by about 5%. On Page 18 (“3 D Comparison”), where we are told the image on the right looks “much more realistic”, it has been stretched by nearly 20%, and on Page 23, to show how well the Shroud fits the Agamemnon mask (“Yeah!”) it is widened by over 30%. If the real Shroud were remoulded into a 3 D figure in the same way that can be done with the mask, it would be seen to represent a wholly anatomically impossible human head.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I think I understand your paper thoroughly, but cannot derive the same conclusions as yourself. Firstly, can we ignore the ludicrous dimensions you quote? The Mask of Agamemnon is life size, not a few millimetres in each direction, and it is roughly as wide as it is high. The reproduction in Valladolid is 25cm x 28cm, and one in New York is 26cm x 25cm. However, the most important dimension is not the height or width, but the third. If the mask was laid flat on a table, how high would the nose be above the table surface? The Met Museum copy gives this as 7cm. A cloth pulled tightly over the mask, in a straight line from ear to nose to ear would be three or four centimetres wider than the mask, and if it was loosely draped it would be even wider. If the Shroud does indeed exactly match the width of the Mask (or of a theoretical body), then it cannot have been draped over it. It must have been more or less horizontal, and the image therefore projected vertically. Far be it from me to insinuate anything. I measured, and requested my readers to measure, the dimensions of the various copies of the Shroud you reproduce in your paper, often side by side, as on Pages 17,18 and 23. The image gets progressively wider and wider in proportion to its height, as specified. You are very welcome to check this for yourself; after all, its your paper. The progressive distortion, which incidentally fits your hypothesis of a loosely draped cloth, may be an inadvertent artefact of the pdf, but it cannot be denied that it is there..","date":"2015-10-17","mins":"5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"id":"comment-212848","author":"hugh_farey","post":"OK may disagree with the “majority of the authenticists” (I do myself, but for different reasons), but I think that collimated transmission, and that vertically up and down, is indeed what the “majority of the authenticists” believe. It is convenient to take measurements of the Shroud from Shroud Scope. Readers are invited to take a couple, of their own choice, one vertical and one horizontal, and calculate the ratio between the two. Repeating those measurements using the image immediately above OK’s in the paper he quoted, they will find that the width of the Shroud has been considerably increased. They will therefore be surprised to find that the image of the Shroud immediately above this post is correctly proportioned. In this case, however, they should measure the image of the Mask of Agamemnon, both in the original paper and above, when they will find that the mask has been considerably narrowed from what it was in the paper! How extraordinary. I order to reconcile these problems we must remember that the Shroud is, of course, flat, but the mask of Agamamnon, although its ears have been squashed outwards, is not at all flat, but maintains its original “face profile” rather well. See, for example, the three quarter profile at http://images.fineartamerica.com/images medium large/mask of agamemnon 2 bob christopher.jpg. So, apart from the ears, the flat Shroud neatly reproduces the curved face of Agamemnon. This is not evidence for any kind of drape, but rather for the vertical radiation hypothesis OK rejects. I am intrigued by the statement, “the transmission certainly wasn’t vertical.” If the darkness/distance correlation exists at all, it is important that whatever emerged from the body at a specific point was represented on the cloth at a specific point. OK admits that if the radiation is not collimated this “theoretically may result in multiple images of the same body points”. Quite so. If the transmission is perpendicular to the surface of the body or the surface of the Shroud, then some parts of the Shroud would receive no radiation at all, and not darken, while other parts would receive radiation from several places, and therefore darken more than they would if they only received radiation from only one place. The sides of the nose, for example, would be dark, but this is not what is observed on the Shroud. OK actually says of his 4 diagrams of possible transmission that “all 4 ways give similar results.” So, how can he be so dogmatic that “the transmission certainly wasn’t vertical”?.","date":"2015-10-17","mins":"1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"id":"comment-212879","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I still do not clearly follow your reasoning. Your own measurements from the ingenious Lavoie image of a cloth superimposed on a man show that while an actual width of the face is 8.8cm, a contact image produced by such a drape would be 12.2cm, an increase in width of nearly a third. Is this what you call a ‘minor distortion’? Is so, then I do follow your reasoning, but simply disagree that increasing the width of an image by a third is a minor distortion. Other people have suggested that the actual width of 8.8cm is represented by a vertical transmission image which is also 8.8cm. This would come about if the cloth were held flat above the body. I do not know how deliberate – perhaps not at all – the different widths of the face in your paper are. Here are the ones I was referring to. Your comment about Cyrano de Bergerac is silly. The Agememnon mask, laid on a table, projects 7cm above the table, as I said. It is about 25cm across. In simple mathematical terms, an equilateral triangle 25cm across and 7cm high has diagonal sides of 28.6cm. A cloth stretched tight across the face would be that wide. If it were more loosely draped it would be wider still. How is this observation nonsense? Finally, checking things with calipers and a tape measure, I find that the distance measured by a tape measure across my nose from ear to ear is well over 25% more than the distance measured directly using calipers.

Now that you seem to agree that the heads in your paper were distorted widthwise, and produce two heads of the same proportion above, the upper one looks a good deal more realistic to me, but not to you. It’s a matter of opinion. Although a mathematically calculated triangle shows a 14% increase in length via the two angled sides – not a major distortion perhaps – the Latendresse practical equivalent shows a 28% increase, which I do consider a major distortion. Maybe you don’t. It’s a matter of opinion. I know the papers you refer to well. The old Ercoline and Jackson paper is extremely detailed, and compares 23 measurements of a set of 98 living people with their equivalents on the Shroud. Without going into the uncertainties of this exercise (how you make a precise measurement involving the elbows or nipples of the Shroud image, for example), I can be seen that Ercoline and Jackson find that in only 5 cases does the Shroud measurement exceed the human measurement by more than 10%. These are in two hip width measurements, two finger length measurements and a forearm measurement (with all the uncertainty of not knowing where the elbow is). The only two face width measurements show that the Shroud image is 6% and 8% wider than the equivalent human width respectively. This is interpreted as indicating some distortion. However, as it is wholly insufficient to be produced by a loosely draped cloth covering a real head, the authors come to the conclusion that: “The character of the distortions and some anomalies of the image seem to be best explained by a vertical mapping process.” I agree with Ercoline.

The first two pictures above appear side by side on page 17 of OK’s paper https://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/3dproperties6 3.pdf. It is OK’s contention that by removing the alleged bands on either side of the face, the image would appear broader, and more realistic, even if the image was in fact the same size. By stretching the second image, the truth of his contention cannot be ascertained. His caption:”What can be seen at first glance is that the right one is much broader” is true because it has been stretched widthwise, not because of the removal of the bands. The images on page 18 are even more grotesque, showing the ‘original’ as much narrower than it really is, and the ‘adjusted’ one much too wide. By the time we get to a mapping of the shroud onto the Agamemnon mask, the images has been distorted so much it clearly looks as if it has been wrapped around a head from ear to ear, but this is entirely due to the aspect ratio, and nothing to do with the removal or adjustment of the bands. OK is correct that Latendresse conjectures (his word) that the image formation was created by a ‘shortest route’ process, but his study does not involve such a process, and he explicitly uses vertical transmission instead. In the Abstract he says: “If a cloth is appropriately laid on the front part of a body,and a body image forms by a vertical projection on the cloth, no major image distortions occur.” In the Introduction he says: “the Shroud was not ﬂattened, yet a real body – assuming a simple vertical projection – can have made these images without creating major image distortions.” The second of his Major Assumptions is: “2. The images formed by a mechanism that reproduces each point by a vertical projection, from the body to the Shroud.” And further on: “Our analyses assume a ‘straight vertical projection’ from the body, to form the images. Several other projections have been analyzed: perpendicular to the sheet, perpendicular to the skin and non collimated (dispersive). Ercoline et al. Argue that the vertical projection avoids most image distortions whereas the others do not. We agree that the vertical projection should create the least amount of image distortions (among the above mentioned projections).” One of the problems in this discussion is that the Shroud man has no ears, and the exact position of the hair is difficult to be precise about. If, as it appears, the hair forms a close frame around the face, in the same approximate plane as the cheeks, as if the face was framed in a kind of ‘box’ of hair, then the Shroud was indeed pretty flat, even when loosely draped. However, if the hair is in two lengths covering the ears, then the image is far too narrow to come from a loosely draped cloth..","date":"2015-10-20","mins":"5:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"id":"comment-213279","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Yes, I agree.

If he had, he would know, for instance, that the expression “a little known engraving by Antonio Tempesta” is by the Guardian journalist, and that the engraving is not called “little known” by Charles, so he need not have devoted 15% of his article to refuting it. I think too, and he is not alone in this, that he misses something important about shroud related articles in general, which I think is worth commenting on. In a general “is it or isn’t it?” piece, then it is necessary to present as many arguments on both sides as you know, assess their value, and decide on balance one way or the other. But in a more specific case: “find a context for a 14th century shroud” or “could an earthquake have contributed to a 1st century shroud” then, apart from an acknowledgement that not everybody agrees with your premise, it is simply a waste of space to re iterate all the arguments for or against it. Charles acknowledges: “There is enough uncertainty about the Shroud’s origins to convince some that it is the actual burial shroud of Christ,” and moves on. So should the reader, but Jones devotes another 12% of his article to his computer hacker argument. Why bother? A further 13% is devoted to Charles’ credentials as an expert. This is a very weak form of criticism of an article, which ought to stand or fall by what it says, not on the reputation of its author. In some of his criticism, Steve is on slightly surer ground. Thibault, on this blog, for example, has successfully challenged Charles suggestion that the image was never depicted with a loincloth before the Council of Trent. I think Charles is also a little unfair is supposing that no one has considered the kind of loom upon which the cloth may have been woven. John Tyrer’s article at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi06part6.pdf considers this quite well, acknowledging that both the Z twist and early 4 headle looms are typically European, casting doubt on a 1st century Middle Eastern origin, without, of course, positively disproving it. William Meacham, without giving sources, at http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm, says: “The thread was hand spun and hand loomed; after ca. 1200, most European thread was spun on the wheel.” Elsewhere we find: “Textile analysis suggests that the cloth originated in First Century Israel and that it was produced on a Syrian or Egyptian loom used during the time of the Roman occupation of Palestine. It appears to be identical to unique linen cloth found at the Masada fortress.” (Quoted, for example, at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/porter1.pdf) As far as I know there is not a shred of truth in this entire statement, but if I’m wrong it suggests that some quality research into the textile has indeed been carried out.

You begin by airily announcing that there is evidence of early herringbone weave on the basis of a 1st Century silver vessel showing a character wearing a striped costume with faint alternating diagonal hatching on the stripes, the embroidery on some epitaphioi, the base of carved alabaster throne and Christ’s robe in a miniature. Your expertise lies in knowing of these artifacts and being able to demonstrate them with references, for which we thank you, but we need not agree that they all illustrate herringbone cloth, or demonstrate that it was manufactured prior to the 14th century. I don’t, for one. Had you stuck to the Stavronitika epitaphios you could have been on stronger ground. After all, here is a picture of a Shroud with a herringbone pattern, and here is the actual Shroud which has a herringbone weave. There is a logical inference. It is not proof, or a true fact, that the one derives from the other, but it is a sensible infererence. There are counter indications. The Stavronitika herringbone pattern is at rightangles with respect to the Shroud’s weave, and the Thessaloniki epitaphios shows herringbone embroidery as a general filler for any blank spaces, such as the sky, angels’ halos and so on. (The Stavronitika one leaves the sky unfilled) Next you wrote: “On 1988 radiocarbon dating, ‘sample 4′ was lift off the Cope of Saint Louis d’Anjou (1274 1297), a 13th c. CE ‘linen three in one’!” which you amended five hours later to “Reminder three: the Cope of Saint Louis d’Anjou (1274 1297), a 13th c. CE does combine linen herringbone and three in one and could be mistaken for the TS to the uninitiated eye.” This is only partially true, as Gian Marco later demonstrated: Linen – Yes, Herringbone – Yes, but ‘three in one’ – No. The herringbone is in embroidery stitching, not weaving, and looks nothing like 3/1 twill. Now we come to the Grandson antependium. Rather similarly to the Stavronitika epitaphios, large areas are left unembroidered, but over the embroidered area, herringbone is used as a convenient space filler. The archangel Michael has collar, wings, halo, hem of tunic, sash and a thin central panel of his tunic in herringbone. None of them resembles a loros. He is carrying a cloth over one arm. It is not embroidered in herringbone. Not only the angels, but also a couple of insense burners are also embroidered in herringbone. Not, I think, to represent cloth. Now Max, everybody who reads this will be able to look up all these things on Google, and check that everything I have described is true. They will admire my dedication, agree that my inferences are valid, but come to their own conclusions about whether they agree with me. Some will, some won’t. That’s how ‘being an expert’ works. It does not rely on ‘the initiated eye,’ nor anouncements of ‘true facts,’ nor cheerful epithets of ‘none so blind as those who will not see, nor even ‘fields of expertise.’ I think they’re just patterns..","date":"2014-10-30","mins":"7:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"id":"comment-166891","author":"hugh_farey","post":"After all that, Max? I’m disappointed. If you want anyone to believe you are an expert it’s no use shouting “The TRUE fact is the herringbone patterned stole or long scarf Saint Mchael wears IS EXACTLY DRAPED AS A LOROS!” You have to demonstrate your expertise. “Shall I repeat, you’d BETTER stick to your own field of expertise rather then give lesson to me.” No, Max. I think a lesson is exactly what you need, so here goes. ===== The Wikipedia article on the Loros explains that it went through considerable modification. It began as a long stole looped over the neck or shoulders. The shorter end dropped down the front almost to the floor, and the longer end crossed around the back and ended up draped over the left arm. The Byzantine illustrations in the article do not show quite how the crossing round the back was accomplished. Over the course of the 11th to 13th centuries the design was modified so that the two hanging ends dropped from a wide collar. Again, the long end fell down the front, but got shorter, but the long end still came forward from behind and was draped over the left arm as before. By the 14th century the whole thing may have been sewn to the tunic beneath, but there was invariably a hanging over the left arm. The Grandson archangel, dated about 1270, has nothing over his left arm. No loros. He does have the collar and dropping front strip, but there is no indication that his wide sash, the hem of his tunic, or the cloth over his right arm, are part of a loros. They could be stylistic elements derived from a loros, but not, as such, a loros itself. For a full discussion of the development of the loros from the Roman (pre Christian) toga and its later adoption of the symbolism of the shroud of Christ, see, for example, pages 153 – 156 in the Chapter on “Imperial Costume and Regalia” in the “Catalogue of the Byzantine Coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection” which is on Google Books. ===== There..","date":"2014-10-30","mins":"8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/27/more-on-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"More on Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"id":"comment-167144","author":"hugh_farey","post":"No danger of that, David!

Like the head to head double image, which lacks either artistic or archaeological context, the weave of the Shroud seems to lack technological context. We can laugh, but OK is correct in supposing that by sticking to these precise criteria, the Shroud clearly does not exist at all! So what to do? We have to loosen our parameters, I believe. By letting go of some of the details above, we may find cloths which, although not identical, at least bear some comparison. The V&A fragment shows at least some of the Shroud’s characteristics, and it may be that some early Egyptian fabrics show others. Indian silks may show still others. I don’t think any of these can be rejected simply because they are not identical. I think that is as far as I can go without the advice of someone with an extensive experience of medieval or 1st Century (preferably both) weaving, who can come to a decision of their own, and explain why they have done so, and why they reject the alternative.

I have never seen any evidence for invisible weaving, let alone the invisible weaving itself. Shroud 2.0 is sufficient to show individual threads, and clearly shows where the odd thread here and there has been extracted, there is no evidence to show that any ‘invisible’ repair has been made. Anybody with Shroud 2.0 who thinks they have found an example should screengrab and post it forthwith! The reply, “of course you can’t see invisible mending – it’s invisible” does not impress me.

Several of di Lazzaro’s papers are at academia.edu and can be read for themselves, without having to go through Louis’s interview. ‘Superficial and Shroud like coloration of linen by short laser pulses in the vacuum ultraviolet’ is the most informative. All he has been attempting over the last eight years or so is to reproduce a surface degradation of linen similar to that apparently observed on the Shroud, by means of electromagnetic radiation. Infra red radiation (heat) could produce the right colour, but the heat generated within the fibres by the effects of the radiation damaged the threads in a dissimilar way to the Shroud. Radiation at 10.6 micrometres having failed to produce the desired outcome, radiation at 0.3 micrometres, and then 0.2 micrometres was tried instead, generated by an Xe Cl and an Ar F laser respectively, of which the first was found less satisfactory than the second. The problem is a little like cooking a rare steak, when a very high temperature is required for a very short time, in order to brown the surface without overcooking the inside. Very hot, very fast, is the answer, but even with the Ar F laser, if the pulse was short, insufficient energy was transferred, but if the pulse was long, the penetration of the cloth was too deep. The answer was to deliver a series of very short pulses (200 pulses at 11 nanoseconds long, for example). Appropriate degradation was achieved by a total reception of about 26 J/cm2, which requires an intensity of about 10 MW per pulse. Even so, some aspects of the colour and penetration of the Shroud image were not duplicated, and require further experimentation. 1) Di Lazzaro’s experiments never extended to more than few square centimetres, and no attempt was made to reproduce any aspect of the image per se. To do so would either take a very long time or a great many more lasers, or a process unknown to science, or a process unknowable to science – a miracle. Scientists do not engage in the last, and the second last is very much a fringe pursuit. 2) The image on the Shroud is that of a man in repose. To what extent it reflects the process of Resurrection is beyond any current knowledge, either scientific or theological. 3) If it were ever established that the linen of the Shroud within the boundary of a bloodstain, was degraded in the same way as the image outside the bloodstain, there would be a strong presumption that the blood was added after the image and the Shroud was the product of artifice. This has not been established. However the evidence that the blood was added before the image is not particularly strong either. Nor has di Lazzaro or any other of the radiation hypothesists carried out experiments on blood to determine its effect. One might surmise that a series of powerful laser pulses sufficient to ‘scorch’ cloth would create an observable alteration to a bloodstain. 4) All these experiments could be carried out within a graduate or postgraduate study programme without incurring any extra expense..","date":"2015-08-13","mins":"11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/11/tantalizingly-close-enough/","cat":"article","title":"Tantalizingly Close Enough?"},{"id":"comment-197240","author":"hugh_farey","post":"“What I find to be exceedingly abominable is Christians neither destroy the holy places of other religious groups, nor the historical holy artifacts held within.” Really?

In this case, the authors seem to have misapplied various findings to the possibility of neutron emission distorting the radiocarbon date of the shroud, and it is disappointing that nobody took them up on this before their article was published. For instance their evidence for an earthquake in 33 AD is extremely shaky. Although they list no less than 6 references for this, every one is directly derived from the biblical accounts of the resurrection, which, even if literally true, do not give any date at all! For another example they say that ” [Most writers] accept the occurrence of the Resurrection earthquake, to which they assign the severity of a catastrophic event, characterised by a local magnitude ML = 8.2.” However they only give one reference for this, At enormous expense, I can quote some exact words of the reference: “The fact that these earthquakes in Jerusalem are not mentioned by contemporary pagan writers, or by three out of the four evangelists, suggests that they may have been inspired by the topos of natures reflecting events of great importance, and they must not be considered as referring to historical earthquakes.” Ambaseys (the author of the reference) goes on to suggests that if the fissures in the vicinity of the Holy Sepulchre are due to an earthquake (which they show is probably not the case), “the causative earthquake should have been strong enough to destroy Jerusalem, for which there is no evidence.” Ambaseys is generous enough to mention, albeit with a wink of incredulity, three modern writers who disagree with him, as they believe in the earthquake, “to which they assign a magnitude of a catastrophic event of ML (sic) = 8.2.” There is more, and in detail, but surely we have enough here to begin to show that Carpinteri’s paper is far too speculative to be accepted without a great deal more research on his part..","date":"2014-02-16","mins":"6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/16/the-shroud-of-turin-story-brings-up-all-the-usual-issues-about-click-bait-journalism/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Shroud of Turin story brings up all the usual issues about click-bait journalism"},{"id":"comment-80055","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Oh, yes, time moved on and I forgot your earlier post.

However I was never a professional researcher and have never published anything in a science journal. Being a teacher of general science for 40 years has given me an interest in, and a certain experience of, just about every aspect of the subject, and since I took my degree in the old days of the Open University, when it took six years, I could pick and choose any topics I found interesting, including Geology, Oceanography, Physiological Psychology, Evolution, Ecology and various more general ones like Biology, Technology and Organic Chemistry. My final year was spent on biological statistics! I’ve also taught History and have a passion for emphasising primary sources – I think that may be part of my scientific make up as well. I have, I think, practically all the STURP papers, and, which appears almost unheard of, I’ve read them. There are some surprising errors (Bill Mottern’s X ray team thought the Holland backing cloth was made of cotton, for example), but on the whole they are a model of scientific diffidence, and clearly say where their conclusions were tentative and where further investigation should be encouraged. There is no doubt that Rogers’s much later surface contamination hypothesis is distinctly at variance with earlier findings, and leads to contradictory conclusions in some cases, that the blood spectra are far from definitive and that the whole cotton business is a muddle, but that’s all part of the fun.

This is where a forum like this is so important. A senior academic and Editor in Chief of a respected journal might well be regarded as an expert, while a middle school science teacher might not. However, if the science teacher can demonstrate the invalidity of the academic’s work, then the tables turn. Real experts, in this context, are essentially compendia of experiences and resources, which they can use to demonstrate the value of their opinion. If they don’t do that, but rely on their authority alone, then their opinion is no more valid than anybody else’s. You’re right that “properly assessed” was rather an imprecise term. “Universally assessed” might have been better.

I’m sorry I’m not Dr Phillips, but I guess I can answer your question as well as any. By the “back” side, do you mean the side that wasn’t touching the body? Or the side that was touching the body, but lay underneath it so that the image of the back appeared on it? A quick Google search will give you the images of both halves of the cloth, with the front (face and arms) and the back (buttocks and footprints) sides. To find a picture of the outside of the cloth, which bears no image and less blood, try http://shroud.wikispaces.com/PROPERTIES. This side, without the images, has very rarely been seen, so it is difficult to discuss. Since 1534 it has been hidden by backing cloths, and was only exposed briefly in 2002 when they were changed. Even so, some people have tried to analyse the photos that were taken and think they see a faint image of at least the face. More controversially, some people think the two images of the face (on opposite sides of the same area of cloth) show two slightly different positions of the features. It might be supposed that the half of this cloth that was in contact with the surface of the tomb would have stains or stone dust from the tomb on it, but this has not been confirmed. As for the folding, if it covered a body, the sheet was folded over the head, which is why the two images of the heads are close together. It looks as if the body was laid on the cloth with a short distance over at the foot end, which was folded up over the toes, and a body’s length at the head end, which was draped back over the head and laid against the insteps, possibly even overlapping the bottom bit of cloth by an inch or two.

However the details are still not clear, so could I ask for specific guidance… correct me where I go wrong… First the linen, soaked in appropriate preservatives, is laid on the rock, suitably prepared with raised stones or piles of myrhh. The body is laid on it. Second (and I may get the order wrong here), flowers and spices are piled alongside the body, various bits of wood and other material were placed on top, and then the body was tightly wrapped (Or was the body wrapped first and the other stuff placed around it afterwards?). A cloth ‘cap’ was added last, after the wrapping, to keep the shroud close around the head. I’m confused here. Were there two pieces of cloth – first the shroud (lengthways) and then a long thin bandage wrapped around the shroud transversely to keep it tight? Where do the artifacts fit in? Third, this arrangement was left, with one or more incense/charcoal burners. The heat evaporated the moisture on the cloth, drawing the dissolved solids outwards, so that any image formed was only on the outer surfaces of the threads. Fourth, as the cloth dried out, it also shrank, until it was as tight as it could be around the body, touching only the ‘hills’ of the contours of the body and not the ‘valleys.” Presumably, as it shrank, it stretched the ‘bandage’ wrapped widthways across the body to keep it well wrapped.

Selecting, specifically, Turkish and Palestinian plants, and most of those with conspicuous flowers and entomophilous pollen, and finding his Shroud pollen matched one, he assumed that it would not match anything else, and identified it as that species. He had a pollen that looked like Gundelia, therefore it was Gundelia. The fact that it also looked very much like any other species of thistle was overlooked. Nonetheless, I feel I cannot dismiss Frei’s findings altogether. Even with all the inconsistencies, there remains a kernel of evidence that resists summary rejection, and, until I discover more about it, it constitutes a real objection to any hypothesis that does not include a Middle Eastern sojourn for the Shroud..","date":"2014-08-23","mins":"4:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/coming-out-of-the-closet-on-pollen-and-plant-images/","cat":"books","title":"Coming Out of the Closet on Pollen and Plant Images"},{"id":"comment-30967","author":"hugh_farey","post":"This would be a lot more convincing if Fanti was able to name the “prestigious journal that has accepted and will shortly publish an article,” even if its subject matter “dating chemistry of ancient fabrics based on Raman spectroscopy and FT IR” does not include either his own speciality, mechanics, or any mention of the Shroud.

Some (possibly Max, if I remember correctly) suggest that minor injuries were allowed to be cleaned off, but that major blood losses had to be recovered, or, if still on the body, preserved, so some sort of partial washing might have occurred. The discussion about old dried bloodstains being remoistened, in contrast to new bloodflows caused by the tearing open of (large) wounds in the process of carrying the body to the tomb, is ongoing.

Briefly, I don’t think the shroud has ever been weighed, with or without its backing cloth, although there have been a number of estimates by various indirect means, some of them truly peculiar. Here are some of them: Verginio Timossi: 23 mg/cm2. This was based on a copy of the shroud, not the real thing. Gilbert Raes: 25 mg/cm2. This was based on careful measurement of his tiny extracted fragment, and extrapolated. R. A. Morris: 25 mg/cm2. This was estimated from Compton scatter, again not by actually weighing the shroud, and gave a combined shroud/backing density of 30 40mg/cm2. Dividing this proportionately between the measured thickness for the backing and shroud (270/345) gave about 20mg/cm2 for the shroud and 15mg/cm2 for the backing, although Schwalbe & Rogers considered the shroud value too low, considering “the comparatively open weave structure of the backing cloth.” Giulio Riggi: 20+/ 3 mg/cm2. I don’t know where this comes from. Timothy Jull: 22mg/cm2. From direct measurements of the C14 fragment retained by Tucson. Broadly, let’s agree on 25mg/cm2, and a surface area of 440cm x 110cm. That’s about 1.2kg. I myself have a largish, thickish piece of linen of area 45000 cm2 and weight 880g, giving an areal density of 19.6g/cm2. The Shroud, as I have said before, is a thick sturdy piece of cloth, not a delicate fabric. I do not believe it was made threadbare by handling. Another way of thinking about it is in grams per square metre. At 25mg/cm2, that’s 250g/m2. This is towards the heavier end of the sailcloth market, suitable for sails of more than 40 square metres.

I am told that the book features new information from the Savoy family archives, which will be extremely interesting, but I should like to know how accurate they are, and when any particular piece of information was written. I hope Evaristo gives us more than an abstract of his findings. Family tradition is a wonderful thing and leads researchers to particular avenues of exploration which otherwise might not have occurred, but it is not adequate as data. The biggest alteration to the Shroud – the side strip removal and reattachment, or at any rate the insertion of the side seam – was apparently not documented at all, as all we have here is vague speculation. (I accept though that it was done before the Shroud became a possession of the House of Savoy) Let’s look at a couple of passages: repairwork was carried out “but obviously with similar, yet newer, materials containing dyes and other medieval manufacturing ingredients, in an attempt to better blend the new sections in, as best possible, with the original fabric.” An attempt to blend in? Does that sound invisible to you? Not to me. And what does this mean: “Unlike the meticulous repair work that had been carried out in previous centuries by religious expert weavers following the damage caused to the Shroud by fires and which left little trace of the removed sections…” It seems to imply that the repairwork carried out to the Shroud after fires (plural?) was meticulous. I’d like more information about that, as the repairwork after the 1532 fire was downright shoddy. And what of: “the different types of linen, dyes, resins and fabric patches, discovered to have been present on the outermost edges of the sheet.” Really? Discovered by whom? There is evidence of missing threads all over the Shroud, including over the image, using Shroud 2.0. There is a little evidence of mending, but it is far from invisible. My own view is that repairs to the shroud apart from the patches were little more than trimming the edges and sewing them up more strongly. I still do not believe in the reweaving idea.

But you’re correct in that it could be an interesting experiment. I also agree, after reading Architecture for the Shroud, that it was unlikely that anybody stood at a balcony holding onto the exposed shroud for more than an hour, at the most. There were processions back and forth, and at least in some cases the Shroud was exhibited on all sides of the public platform, with a covering cloth raised and lowered three times (calling to mind the triple ostentation of the monstrance at the Service of Benediction). The external expositions were active rather than static. For lengthy devotions, the shroud was placed on some kind of reliquary inside the cathedral. I’m not persuade by considerations of wind, I have to say. I can’t see a holy relic being allowed to flap around like a sheet on a clothes line, let alone the voluminous vestments, tall hats and water soluble decorations. Nor do I think UV degradation over such a short time would be significant. However the idea of weakening by bacterial contamination is plausible, especially if the shroud was put away slightly damp..","date":"2014-05-24","mins":"4:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"id":"comment-124050","author":"hugh_farey","post":"It’s a good question, and one that I have been exploring. First, let’s clear the date thing up. Of the 12 BP dates quoted by the Nature paper, the earliest is one of Oxford’s (795 BP) and the latest one of Arizona’s (591 BP). When calibrated, the Oxford one corresponds to about 1250, and the Arizona one corresponds to about either about 1325, or about 1400, but not the dates in between. This is because of the way the calibration graph zigzags at around that time. In fact, of the 12 BP dates, eight correspond entirely to the period between 1250 and 1335, while four correspond to three dates, one between 1250 and 1335, one between 1335 and 1385, and one between 1385 and 1410, but not any intervening dates. It makes better sense to reject these later dates, and to consider the Shroud as having been dated between 1250 and 1325, a 75 year variation rather than your 170 years or so. Interestingly, a similar operation applied to the 13 dates of the St Louis Cope, which is almost exactly contemporaneous with the Shroud, results in a likelihood of a date between 1220 and 1320, which is a larger spread. Even so, the point Max is making is valid, the discrepancy between the three average dates of the Shroud being about 20 years, while that of the St Louis cope is about 3 years. Riani and Atkinson attempted to explore in some detail whether discrepancies between the 12 individual dates would enable them to reconstruct the positions of those sub samples within the strip cut from the shroud, but this wasn’t possible. However the three average dates were statistically different. The Oxford sample dates to about 1260, and the Arizona sample to about 1300, a difference of 40 years. (Compare this to equivalent figures of about 1265 and 1270 for the St Louis Cope, and we can see why the Shroud discrepancy is significant). Be that as it may, Max wants to know how much contamination I suggest would make a 13th century cloth appear older than it really is, in a graduated fashion across four centimetres. The answer is that if from 0% to about 15% of the mass of the sample across its length was 17th century alizarin (madder) combined with the linen, a sufficient discrepancy could be achieved. Sadly I cannot discover by how much the mass of a cloth is increased by dying it. 15% seems to me rather a lot..","date":"2014-05-24","mins":"12:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"id":"comment-124382","author":"hugh_farey","post":"On the contrary, Max, I do have the foggiest notion, but I have to agree I was surprised by the calculation. However, much depends on the original date of the cloth. For other reasons I have been recently inclining towards the mid 13th century, when the C14 calibration graph has a single gradient and the addition of small amounts of dye would make little difference to the calculated date. However, if the original date of the cloth were later, say 1290 or so (as originally suggested by the Nature paper), then the calibration graph zigzags up and down, and tiny variations of C14 make large calendar differences. A BP date of 670, for example corresponds to a calendar date of 1290, while a BP date of 660 can correspond to a calendar date of 1375. An apparent change of 10 years actually corresponds to a calendar change of 85 years.

Just a guess, based on shroud.com’s History. There are listed about 60 showings, public and private, and the information that for some time the shroud was exhibited annually on 4th May for about 30 years in the 15th century. My 60 – 70 was clearly an underestimate, and perhaps your 100 – 150 was more accurate. Now we’re creeping up to 200 – 300. I think you may be pushing it there. 2) I’m not sure what you’re getting at here. There is no evidence about the bleaching of either cloth. The Holland cloth has definitely darkened in some places, which may be due to light, or general grime, or deliberate dying. If the Shroud was bleached then it should be darkening too, as some conservators have feared. If not, then it should be lightening, which I have not heard claimed. 3) I’m not at all in denial of the Savoy royal family tradition. But as far as I know it’s just a tradition, and not substantiated. There is nothing to oppose. 4) I still don’t know what you mean by 70% reliable. If you mean that 70% of all radiocarbon datings pin the artifact down to a single year, then you are being hopelessly generous; if you mean that 30% of all radiocarbon datings are wrong even within their errors bars and after calibration then you are being absurdly mean. Perhaps you mean something, but I’ve no idea what! I must repeat, Max, that scientists don’t do facts in the same way you do. To us, a fact is not the same as a conviction, however deeply held; it is an irrefutable conclusion (although there are variations on exactly what irrefutable might mean). I have not reached an irrefutable conclusion about many things to do with the shroud (the chemical basis of the colours of the quad mosaics being a notable exception), and such inclinations as I have are usually easily refutable; the trouble is however, they mostly haven’t been.

In an earlier post I wrote: Fanti’s book and the brou ha ha that came with it involved various more or less dubious means of dating old flax, including the highly controversial mechanical testing. After a while he published a paper in Vibrational Spectroscopy, in which all mention of the shroud and all his mechanical dating methods were omitted, leaving only FTIR spectroscopy. He subjected 12 samples of known age from 3000 BC to the present to his process, and observed a noticeable progressive change in the spectra recorded. Flax, it appears, can be shown to degrade with age. In ideal situations (permanent storage in a single place of constant environmental conditions) his findings suggest an ascertainable age band of 400 years, which might be narrowed if further ressearch was carried out. Although this method is unlikely ever to be better than C14 dating, it has the merit of being wholly non destructive. In more variable conditions however (and the Shroud springs inevitably to mind) this does not seem a promising line of research. He has since returned to the mechanical testing, publishing first a device for carrying it out, and now “Multi parametric micro mechanical dating of single fibers coming from ancient flax textiles,” in which, again, 11 samples of known date were subjected to 5 mechanical tests, and again, he found a correlation between his results and their ages with a “relative standard uncertainty of the method” of about 200 years. He does not include any Shroud fibres in this study. I believe that the criteria and criticisms which applied to the earlier paper still apply. His fibres from the Shroud were, by definition, loose, having either detatched during the course of its history or by being sucked out by the vacuum collector. They can validly be described as not typical of the fibres still part of intact threads, and as having been likely to have suffered more mechanical damage than the rest of the shroud. However there is no way of knowing how consistent their mechanical deterioration has been. It is overwhelmingly more likely that they ‘date’ by the mechanical deterioration method to a time considerably earlier than that of the manufacture of the shroud. All this may be explained in his new book, but having bought and read his previous one without being informed of much more than the publisher’s blurb told us, I am reluctant to buy the new one until somebody else reviews it!

So about 350 pollen grains were vacuumed from the Tunic of Argenteuil. If only 5% of the tunic had been sampled (roughly the area sampled by sticky tapes on the shroud) they’d have found about 17 grains. Those who examined the STURP tapes said they observed very few pollen grains. Unless Max Frei’s tapes were quite extraordinarily rich in pollen, his identification of 56 species of plant looks increasingly suspect. But then, so does this. About half the pollen on the tunic comes from Stinging Nettles and Syrian Mesquite. Both these plants are insect pollinated, and their pollen does not float about in the air. The only way such a proportion of pollen could arrive on the tunic was if quantities of Stinging Nettle and Syrian Mesquite flowers were laid on it. Then, what about this: “the bloodstains on the tunic were aligned exactly with the imprinted wounds visible on the shroud.” Really? What wounds, exactly. Not the nails, spear or crown of thorns, presumably. Are we talking about a precise correlation of the dumb bell shaped flagellation wounds?

I started with Google Translate, and carefully worked my way through re interpreting anything that was literally non sense. I notice that Dan often uses Bing. Does anybody have any reason why one is better than the other. Google has a tendency simply to ignore negatives, I find, which can completely alter the sense of a passage, which Bing comes up with weird and whimsical idiomatic translations of passages which don’t require it. Anyway, here goes: After a quick summary of what the book is and its reception, Gian Marco says.. “In fabric over time the cellulose in the fibers is altered and degrades. The more time that passes, the greater the alteration. By measuring, in a fabric of unknown age, some parameter that is related to the degree of alteration, and comparing it with the values of the same parameter in ancient fabrics of known ages, the age of the unknown tissue can, in principle, be estimated. This would work if it were not that alterations may proceed at different speeds depending on several factors. In short, the degradation of cellulose is not a clock that always ticks at the same rate (as it is does with the decay of radiocarbon). To take a trivial example, if I meet someone and observe her dress, I can try to figure out if the dress is new or old, looking more or less if it is worn, torn, faded or crumpled. But I can not correctly estimate the age if I do not take into account various other factors such as the quality of the fabric, the conditions in which it was stored and how and how much was used. The new results. Fanti has obtained some antique fabrics from different eras of approximately known date. He conducted three sets of measurements using three different methods. In the first and second series he measured certain alterations of cellulose using spectroscopic methods – Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. For spectroscopic analyses Fanti turned to two more professors, Anna Tinti of Bologna and Pietro Baraldi of Modena. In the third series he measured a set of mechanical parameters, for example the behavior of fibers under tension and the breaking load (with the assistance of a doctoral student, Pierandrea Malfi). In each series, from measurements on samples of known age, Fanti has constructed a calibration curve, which represents how the trend varies with age. Then he measured the same parameters on the Shroud and derived an estimate of its age by making a comparison with the calibration curve. Fanti says that he has not found in the literature similar calibration curves for these three methods, and supposes that they have been introduced by him for the first time. There were nine ancient fabrics used in compiling the calibration curves, with ages from 3000 BC to 1000 AD. Five were from Egypt, three from Israel and one from Peru. He also used two modern fabrics of recent manufacture. The confidence intervals at 95% for the origin of the fabric of the shroud with the three methods were respectively: 300 BC ± 400 and 200 BC ± 500, 400 AD ± 400. Averaging these values, Fanti arrived at a final result to 33 BC ± 250 and is satisfied that this interval includes the time of Christ. We see that the three results cover a very wide range, from 300 BC to 400 AD. Considering the bounds of the intervals of confidence, the dates extend further, from 700 BC to 800 AD. The dispersion would be even greater if Fanti had used his original result for the first series, which was 752 BC ± 400. However here Fanti has made a correction, trying to take into account the effects of the fire of 1532 in which the Shroud was involved, and moved the date from 752 BC to 300 BC. This is based on measurements made on a recent piece of fabric which has been subjected to heating. This correction is somewhat arbitrary. On the one hand it is not known at what temperature and for how long the cloth of the Shroud has been heated by the fire. On the other hand the effects on a new fabric manufactured using modern technology may be different from the effects on the Shroud, also taking into account that the damage triggered by the fire may have worsened over the centuries. It should be noted that, as he made a correction for the first method, Fanti should also have made a correction for the third method, as results from similar heating tests of modern materials produced an apparent aging “of a few centuries” using this method. However it seems that Fanti decided to rejuvenate the result of the first series, whose original results came out too old, but preferred not to do the same to the third series, whose original results came out too young. All tests were conducted on individual fibers of flax. These are the ‘elementary’ fibers which make up the threads. The fibers are thin and have a diameter of about 10 or 20 micrometers (thousandths of a millimeter). Thread is manufactured by the twisting together of fibers in the spinning process. Any section of thread may contain a hundred or so fibres. There is no guarantee that the methods are reliable The factors that affect the apparent aging of a fabric are variable in nature. We can cite the light, the conditions of temperature and humidity, the presence of dust, exposure to various chemical agents, and mechanical stresses. Also factors that seem insignificant can accumulate a significant effect if continuing for centuries. For example, a linen fabric which is folded can produce damage to the fibers in the bends (which is why today the Shroud is kept fully extended to prevent further damage). In general, the processes of degradation can be very slow and are not easily simulated with laboratory experiments. Hypothetically, you can imagine some differences in the conditions of preservation of the Shroud compared to other fabrics. The weather conditions, temperature and humidity, were different in Europe from in Egypt or Israel. In particular, moisture is harmful to fabrics and the Egyptian climate is probably drier than the French or Piedmontese. The methods of processing flax in Europe in the 14th century may have been different from those of ancient Egypt, such as the bleaching process. The comparison fabrics probably rested for centuries in a tomb and then remained in the warehouses of a museum, while the Shroud has had a much more lively history, especially in the early days. It was transported here and there, both before and after the transition to the Savoy. It was folded and unfolded, and later rolled up on a tight cylinder and unrolled. It was involved in a fire. It was mended. It was exposed to light outdoors, and to the fumes of incense or candles or torches. Perhaps it was brushed to clean it. Also there may have been unknown episodes in the history of the Shroud, especially in the period before 1500, which have had a measurable effect today. Fanti says he has conducted tests to assess the “systematic effects” of various factors, but in practice he has only made the correction that we saw for the first series. These uncertainties mean that the methods used by Fanti are inherently unreliable because it can not be excluded that there were influences of factors known or unknown, with effects difficult to assess. So, if his methods result in a date that differs from that obtained in other ways, it is necessary to doubt the result. We have two reasons to think that the fabric of the Shroud was manufactured around 1300, the radiocarbon dating and the historical fact of its first appearance. On the other hand, we have no reason to suggest that the Shroud is from the first century. The only “evidence” of antiquity adduced by Shroudologists is in the (non existent) fingerprints of two coins of Pontius Pilate! However, there is a more concrete reason to think that the fibers of the Shroud used by Fanti were unsuitable for testing. In two television interviews, Fanti was shown withdrawing a fiber from a piece of fabric. He separated out a thread and pulled out a fiber with tweezers. But this is not the way in which he got the fibers of the Shroud. He did not have a piece of fabric, or even pieces of intact thread. He used a dust collection made by Giovanni Riggi di Numana in 1978. It should be noted that from 1534 to 2002 the cloth of the Shroud was continuously fastened with stitching to another linen cloth for support. In 1978 Riggi unstitched some sections on the edges and stuck in the cavity a vacuum cleaner with which he collected dust in cotton filters interposed along the tube outlet. Years later, some of these filters were made available to Fanti. From these filters, in particular the one designated as “h”, Fanti took the material for his analysis. Together with dust of various kinds were also fragments of fibers of the shroud, in addition to flax fibers of the support fabric, cotton fibers from the filters and possibly other fibers of uncertain origin. We can assume that any fibers of the Shroud collected from the vacuum extractor had deteriorated more than the fibers still enclosed in the threads. Fibers have, in the course of time, detached from the back of the Shroud and become trapped inside the cavity between the cloths, but those that have would be either weaker or more damaged than those which remained in the threads. For example they could be fibers that originally came from areas of stitching or burning or soaking in water or any other places that had suffered damage for some reason. In addition to the fibers that had already become detached in the past, Riggi’s vacuum cleaner could have detached others while it was working, and those fibres, too, would be weaker or more damaged than those which remained. Fanti’s material is thus shown to be unrepresentative in being particularly deteriorated, so it is no wonder that the age he calculated is more apparent than real. In a 2008 article Fanti showed photographs of many fibers collected by filters of which he had already come into possession, including those from filter “h”. We saw that the fibers were very short, averaging about a millimeter. Usually linen fibers are somewhat longer. So those used by Fanti were small fragments derived from the breakage of fibers which were already integrally fragile. In his book Fanti does not say how long the fibers from his comparison tissues were, but he may provide more detail in a future publication. After they were collected in 1978, the fibers remained on the filters for several years, together with the rest of the dust and dirt sucked in. The individual fibers were exposed to dust on all sides. Earlier than 2008, fibers were collected from Fanti’s filters using adhesive tape. Photographs were obtained showing the fibers on the tape. Fanti does not say if these fibres were used for his present experiments, but if they were they had remained in contact with the glue for a time of perhaps several years and then a solvent may have been used to remove them from it. We hope to find more information on these procedures when Fanti’s next article appears. However they were obtained, Fanti then observed them at length under a microscope. The aim was to separate the flax fibers from the Shroud from those coming from the cloth support or from those of cotton or other origin. Looking into the microscope, Fanti says, he was able to distinguish the fibers of the Shroud not only from those of other material, but also from the linen fibers of the fabric support. For observation under the microscope, the fiber must be illuminated and, if it is not on a tape, somehow manipulated. In short, the Shroud material used for the experiments was not the most fortunate. In his book Fanti makes no secret that the fibers of the Shroud which he used come from Riggi’s filters but does not comment on the risks implicit in the fact that these fibers have had a more complicated history than those freshly extracted from other fabrics containing intact threads. We can only note Fanti’s own words concerning the third method, the mechanical one, with reference to his experiments on the comparison fibres. (p. 85): “In some cases, in fact, fibers taken from particular parts of a thread which had been more exposed to the environment and mechanical actions such as rubbing, showed a structural weakening, due to probable microcracks, which sometimes lead the mechanical method to result in dates with amplitude shifts of up to a thousand years.” Such is the true accuracy of this method. Two fibers taken from the same thread can produce dating with a difference of a thousand years. Fanti continues: “To avoid incurring similar problems of measurement, the fibers used to perform the mechanical tests – and thus the determination of the curves of dating – were taken from their fabric in a similar way to those used to pick up the fibers from the Shroud.” I do not know if Fanti means that he extracted fibers from his comparison fabrics with a vacuum cleaner, at least for the third series, but in any case he could not select the fibers that had separated in time from the points of greatest wear and tear that had built up for centuries. … For my part, I think that there is no reason to doubt that the material used by Fanti really comes from the filters of the vacuum cleaner used by Riggi in 1978. It is known that Riggi kept the filters and later on several occasions had bestowed portions of the material to others. Today Riggi is gone, but I do not think that Fanti has made false declarations about the origin of the fibers examined by him. I would also add that I can not know if Fanti has correctly identified the fibers of the Shroud, distinguishing them from other fibers collected from the extractor, such as those of cloth or filter support, but that would be material of a more recent age than the Shroud itself and not could provide a dating at the time of Christ. In short, I believe that the results are unreliable, not for any doubts about the origin of the material, but for the inadequacy of the methods used.”.","date":"2013-04-04","mins":"10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/sales-and-amazon-reviews-of-fantis-new-book/","cat":"books","title":"Sales and Amazon Reviews of Fanti’s New Book"},{"id":"comment-45832","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Goodness me.

I also think that’s all it is, an interesting correspondence. I agree that there is a small group of people who maintain that some sites in India also have New Testament correspondence. To claim that this, or any of the other evidence attested, “strongly suggests” anything, or is “ample evidence” is simply untrue. I note that the whole tenor of Tom Devins’ comment above is much less assertive. “I don’t know” and “Maybe, just maybe” and “Who will ever know?” I don’t think this is ‘goof ball’ and agree that “reasonable questions suggesting other possibilities” are at least worth some consideration.

However, I’m very grateful to Gian Marco’s full reference. Flury Lemberg is impressed by the fact that the shroud seam was carefully made, but she does not suggest that it was particularly complex, nor that it was particularly unusual, nor that there is anything unusual about finding a similar stitch in the Masada textiles. She quite specifically does not imply that the stitching defines the period of manufacture. I’m not sure that I agree with her idea that the seam was designed “to make the seam disappear on the face of the cloth as much as possible.” I invite readers to look at their own shirts and trousers. My shirts have joins which look similar to the seam of the shroud, and the rolled underside is clearly detectable through the outer surface. My trousers, on the other hand, have a more invisible join, as the underside edges are not rolled, but folded flat against the main cloth..","date":"2013-11-28","mins":"11:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/28/unraveling-unusual-stitches-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"books","title":"Unraveling Unusual Stitches in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-53420","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Selvedges, eh? Take a piece of woven cloth. The two ends have been cut off a larger roll, and if not finished off in some way, the weft threads will slide off the ends of the warp threads and the edges will become tatty. This finishing off, I will call a HEM. The two sides of the cloth are held together by the weft threads themselves, and do not need any finishing off to keep the cloth intact. These two sides are the SELVEDGES. They do not require stitching at all. The shroud of Turin has its famous sidestrip, which may or may not be separate from the main cloth. It appears that at the Raes sample end, it was separate, as Raes took his sample to pieces, but such is the continuity of the weft threads across the supposed seam that there is some doubt as to whether the stitching along it actually joins two pieces of cloth together or not. I will refer to this as a TUCK. The idea that a much wider piece of cloth had a strip taken out of it, and the two sides sewn back together has little to recommend it, in my view. A quick look at the Durante photo on shroudscope shows that the shroud is actually hemmed (the side folded over and sewn down) all around the perimeter, including the exposed edges of the cut away corners. How old this continuous hem is, and what stitches were used in its creation, I’ve no idea. However as a consequence no selvedges are now visible at all. So what and where is the mysterious stitching that may or may not resemble something from Masada? Presumably we are talking about the stitching of the TUCK, which almost certainly has nothing to do with SELVEDGES. So what was the stitch across the tuck? Alan Whanger describes it as a “wide relaxed running stitch, as S shaped stitch.” His description does not sound terribly complicated. The only quote I can find from Flury Lemberg herself is at http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous seasons/case shroudchrist/interview.html, and says, “The linen cloth of the Shroud of Turin does not display any weaving or sewing techniques which would speak against its origin as a high quality product of the textile workers of the first century.” How unusual is that?.","date":"2013-11-28","mins":"6:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/28/unraveling-unusual-stitches-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"books","title":"Unraveling Unusual Stitches in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-203950","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I do not know if this book advances Giulio Fanti’s ideas beyond what we have seen before. There would be, I think, considerable value in discovering a reliable method of dating archaeological material other than by radiocarbon decay, and to his credit Fanti explored both the chemical and physical deterioration of linen, by means of FTIR spectrography and mechanical testing respectively. His method was to take known samples of different ages and correlate them to changes in their spectra and mechanical properties. If a reasonable correlation were found, then it would be possible to date material of unknown provenance by these methods. Unfortunately, Fanti has not published his findings in detail, and what has been published shows such poor correlation that his work has not been taken up by archaeological science as useful. So many other factors than age can contribute to the deterioration of archaeological materials that it seems unlikely that any measurement of such deterioration can be a reliable method of dating it.

Now I’m bothered by how you might be able to persuade us doubters that your parallels between the Pray manuscript and the Shroud are deliberate, as it seems hardly fair just to say ‘I don’t believe you’ without suggesting how you might go about changing our minds. Being supported by other experts in iconocryptanalysis would be a start, as David Goulet has suggested, or demonstrating more unequivocal comparisons. To me, the blood smudge is trivial, but the diagonal line of crosses and the L&P holes, although I do not agree that they are connected with the Shroud, are clearly deliberate, and not easy to explain. A picture of Christ being flogged leaving cruciform welts would be good, and your ‘palmette’ illustrations are a good start, but they don’t convince me. Similarly, some kind of artistic tradition showing a rigid rectangular shroud in a Three Marys painting, or a herringbone design being represented as stepped pyramids rather than stacked zig zags would also be effective.

The Annual General Meetings of the International Society of Cryptostenographologists must be a riot. “So what do you make of the loros as Byzantine imperial insigne symbolic of Christ’s Shroud?” Not nothing at all. It seems that this was a pre Christian tradition overlaid by Christian symbolism, rather like Saturnalia turning into Christmas. Actual loroi, as you have mentioned, seem to have been richly decorated with jewels and bore no relation to the real thing. The Grandson antependium is indeed somewhat different, in that it is more simple, but there is nothing to suggest that the herringbone needlework is intended to represent the herringbone of the Shroud, particularly as the insense burners are filled in in exactly the same style. I do agree that if the Shroud were ever convincingly shown to be ancient, then the herringbone loroi might constitute a contributory corollary, but I do not think that they can be assumed to be derivative until that occurs. “How can you explain this striking departure from the traditional Byzantine depiction of the lavishly adorned ceremonial long and narrow stole.” The relatively late date and the Western artistic tradition are adequate in themselves as explanations without needing any knowledge of the Shroud by the embroiderers. “I have produced a comparative iconography of the lower portion of the TS face ‘tailed epsilon’ shaped blood trickle dripping onto the eyebrow ridge in BOTH the HP Ms Christ’s and the TS man’s forehead. The HP Ms Christ’s is REMARKABLY SHROUD LIKE while the TS man’s is REMARKABLY HP MANUSCRIPT LIKE!” I have studied your article carefully. The two alleged blood smears are not remarkably similar at all to me, and I think it is special pleading to suggest that the Pray artist only used the bottom third of the epsilon stain, which he then smudged downwards to represent the pendant tear drop. “I never said ‘the nose on the Shroud (was) sufficiently crooked for anyone to have depicted it on a painting or a coin’.” Well forgive me; I must have misinterpreted this section, as it appeared to me that you only mentioned the skewed nose in connection with “Fanti’s solidus” to which you provided a link, and you now say “This is totally consistent with one (Edessenian Byzantine?) engraver incorporating Christ’s skewed nose in his engraving of the Pantocrator’s face.” So did they or didn’t they? “When it comes to your opinion on the three issues, bad will and bad faith are sheer euphemisms!” That’s just rude, and also untrue. (Unconnected speculation – is it only authenticists who find it difficult to face contradiction without abusing their antagonists? Can anybody quote an example of an abusive non authenticist?) ““The coins of Justinian II’s first reign (685 – 695 AD) are indeed remarkably shroud like, and it is difficult not to think it was indeed the model.” I did write that, and it’s surely true. It doesn’t mean that the Shroud was the model for the coins, but it is certainly interesting. I’ve no doubt that a Byzantine art historian would attribute it – and perhaps by association the Shroud of the 14th centrury – to the influence of a Roman or Greek image of ‘the wise old man’ being brought from Rome to Constantinople, but I wouldn’t know the truth of the matter. “In all likelihood and obedience to a specific iconological canon, the TS man’s forehead clot DI Slocation in centre hairline of the forehead and stylization as a double stranded quiff of dropping hair, was deemed more suitable both within the general economy of the Justinian II’s Solidus obverse Christ face and… the engraver’s eye.” Not in all likelihood as far as I’m concerned. In all likelihood there is no conection whatever between the double stranded quiff and the epsilon. “Numids Bids, ancientcoins.com, lot numbers: 1729; 578; 579 and 580.” Alas I can only find the last two of these, as you forgot to provide the auction details.

This can be tested and verified by anyone with a cloth and a soldering iron. The “chemically sensitised” amendment is just that, an amendment, and does nothing to weaken his overall argument. On the contrary, it helps to explain some of the real objections that were raised when it was first proposed (impossible in practice, no fluorescence), thus strengthening the argument rather than weakening it. Remarkably, while some authenticists have deemed it wholly impossible for anyone to have heated up a bas relief to scorching point and applied a cloth to it so quickly that only the surface fibres were scorched, they find it quite possible for a dead body to glow like a child’s Electrostorm corona discharge sphere, to explode in a cloud of subatomic particles, or to radiate barely detectable heat in perfectly vertical rays. Both Walter Mc Crone and Ray Rogers came to the conclusion that the Shroud was covered in something that formed the image such that, were it removed, no image at all would be visible.

But this is nonsense. Even before the invention of printing, the reproduction of images from woodcuts and the reproduction of raised surfaces from seals were extremely common, and every artist and craftsman was perfectly familiar with both the concept and the practice of producing “positives” from “negatives” even if they didn’t use those words. Judging by the difficulty Shroud researchers have themselves (is the Shroud hair negative or positive?), it seems that the medieval mind was considerably more familiar with the idea even than the 20th century one, and, in a few years, when film photography has all but vanished altogether, only engravers and brass rubbers will understand the concept at all..","date":"2015-09-13","mins":"4:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/12/new-barrie-schwortz-podcast/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"New Barrie Schwortz Podcast"},{"id":"comment-185745","author":"hugh_farey","post":"No, don’t withdraw it.

Do we think his indeterminate picture of a pile of ashes and a few burnt bedsprings really shows a shrunken skull?

It fairly quotes a couple of medievalist art historians, which is unusually generous, but has little revolutionary to offer until the end, when we learn what exactly Prof. Fanti has discovered. Firstly, by mechanical stress experiments, that there is a 95% probability that the Shroud is from 400 AD. Blithely ignoring the fact that this means that its chance of being first century is vanishingly small, the programme goes on to say that by reflectance spectroscopy, the Shroud is from 200 300 BC, and that the average of three findings (the third is not described) is 33 BC. I wonder what the confidence level of that is. The last part of the programme covers Fanti’s coronal discharge experiments, and, if this isn’t a reconstruction like every other fragment of the programme, we see a brief glimpse of a Shroud like figure apparently produced by draping a mannequin with a cloth and subjecting it to an enormous charge for hours. This is the first I’ve heard of this, and I’ve no faith at all in the ridiculuous re enactment and breathless commentary: “This time, Fanti turns up the power to nearly one hundred per cent…” Wow! Sounds impressive. But 100% of what, exactly? And why does the dial we see being turned to 100 actually go up to 120? Does Fanti’s machine actually deliver more than all of something? “… and he bombards the cloth with electricity for more than 24 hours.” And an image forms, which we glimpse a very little of, but which includes skeletonic hands with brightly coloured knuckles. Significantly, although the camera pans towards it, we do not see the face. Fanti himself says: “it is necessary to calibrate very well the energy. Only the range 97 98 it is possible to obtain an image. The corona discharge gives us the most number of compatibility between the experiental results and what we see on the Shroud.” This statement, and the image he actually produced, needs to be displayed and explained in a great deal more detail to be at all convincing. It is a pity that such a significant development in Shroud studies, if so it be, has been introduced in such a brief cryptic manner at the very end of this programme. Or is it all too fanciful to be exposed in the cold light of day?

Charles Freeman is right to be slightly frustrated by counter arguments from Wikipedia, especially one describing the preparation of wooden panels rather than flexible cloth, when his source, Cennino Cennini’s 15th century treatise on painting, is readily available in two different translations and the original, at archive.org. Cennini’s description of “The Way to Work on Linen or Hempen Cloth” is at Chapter 162 et seq. It is not easy to follow, but is clearly designed not to be “rather brittle and susceptible to cracking, thus making it suitable for rigid surfaces only.” The expression “half chalk ground” an the emulsion of gesso and linseed oil, described by Gottsegen, is not from Cennini. There is a good paper on medieval flags at http://destrier.net/astonhall/article medieval painted flags.20070501.pdf, by Rebecca Robynson. She points to another Chapter in Cennini, “Various Ways to do Hangings”, which I have not identified in the archive.org editions, where Cennini recommends omitting gesso altogether. Giorgio Vasari, a century later, says Robynson, also “states that if the canvases are not intended to be stationary, gesso is not to be used because it ‘would interfere with their flexibility, seeing that the gesso would crack if they were rolled up.’ He instead recommends the canvas be primed with a mixture of white lead, walnut oil, and flour after several coats of size.” In other books on medieval gesso, it is said that while Italian artists used calcium sulphate, northern European painters used calcium carbonate, which Freeman also refers to. Having sorted that out, Russ still makes a valid point! It is true that while there is plenty of evidence for calcium carbonate, there is, according to S Tu RP, none for the protein binder which should have accompanied it.

I was referring to the original first edition. However, it is far too optimistic to think that Fanti has yet delivered “hammer blows” nor “a big step towards the revision” to the C14 date. Although there may be a gradual oxidative degradation to linen that weakens its mechanical strength over time, its calibration would depend on using material which had been similarly treated over the years. Cloth which had been subjected to extremes of temperature, humidity or stress such as rolling or unrolling, would be expected to have degraded more than cloth kept in a more constant environment, and even if a fair sample of cloths of different ages were compared, their fibres would still have variable degradation, so it would be necessary to obtain them in a similar fashion. Fibres extracted from intact threads would have suffered less degradation than fibres extracted by sticky tape or vacuuming, or fibres which had become separated from the cloth completely by continual abrasion. Compared to all Fanti’s control samples, the fibres he examined from the Shroud had suffered in all the ways mentioned above, and would be expected to give a much older result than they really should if the measurements were properly calibrated. Nowhere in his book does Fanti explain his methods for this calibration (or give charts or tables showing his results apart from the one mentioned above), but if his 200 BC 1000 AD conclusion is a result of comparing the burnt and battered Shroud to some undisturbed grave cloths, then I suggest that it should carry a serious “environmental weakening” compensatory factor of at least 500 years. 300 AD to 1500 AD is a much more realistic interpretation of Fanti’s results. In that case, of course, not only does Fanti’s work not undermine the C14 tests, it actually supports them! Perhaps I am being over optimistic myself here, but nevertheless, it remains true that the dating of cloth by mechanical weakness has yet to achieve any kind of archaeological credibility. In the same boat, so far, are age related variations in colour, chemistry or vanillin content. As is mentioned in the video, colour experiments gave the Shroud a date of hundreds of years BC, and although Rogers’s work on vanillin is interesting and suggestive, it is insufficiently comprehensive to be considered anything more, yet. It may be that Giulio Fanti’s actual experimental results are more convincing than both his book and his interview, but in that case it is strange that they have never been published, and that his only submitted paper on the subject does not mention them, or the Shroud, at all..","date":"2015-01-11","mins":"9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"id":"comment-182194","author":"hugh_farey","post":"That’s OK, Piero, although I do not understand what exactly you think is “rubbish.” I have a lot of time for Giulio Fanti, as I do for anyone who actually carries out experiments rather than guessing what ‘would have happened’ and hope I made clear that most of the programme’s problems were with the production, not with the interview itself, which was a model of reserve and rectitude. However, the statement that the Shroud dates from 400 AD with a 95% confidence level is not only statistically hopelessly overoptimistic, but also not what Fanti himself says in his book Il Mistero della Sindone, where he appears to give 400 AD +/ 600 years as his 95% confidence level, which is more realistic, but less exciting. (See his diagram on p.102). However even this is part of a dating technique which ignores other sources of mechanical weakness than age alone, and is poorly calibrated against other similarly derived ages from cloths of known date.

Although Riggi’s observation tends to support Morris’ interpretation, subsequent microscopic examination of the tapes showed little or no calcium compound debris from the Shroud image surface.

Or ‘expert,’ for that matter… To be an expert at all you have to have a fairly good, accurate and honest knowledge of all the evidence, and it is not obvious from the high school lecture linked to above that Dr Phillips is aware of any of the evidence contradicting the statements he presents as fact.

The radiation hypothesis is not one I ascribe to, but however it is expressed it must make sense. The radiation could all be vertical, in which case, perhaps, it might correlate to the image, but it cannot, as you describe, be “360 degrees” unless the radiation from any particular part of the body vastly overlaps the radiation from all the other parts. I am fully aware of all the ideas of the Shroud Science Group (of which I too am a member), and am familiar with all the STURP papers. I am also very aware of what has been, and what has not been, published in peer reviewed scientific journals. That is precisely the reason why I am able to challenge them. I am happy to suspend judgement on some ideas in order to follow the arguments presented on a “what if” basis, but where two clearly contradictory statements are presented as “sense” then it behoves me to point out that they aren’t. You’re request to stop arguing is slightly bizarre, if I may say so. I never argue with persons and if we were chatting in a bar together I would be happy to move on to a different topic. But this blog is a (semi) public forum, and arguments put forward are there to be explored as a way of increasing overall understanding of the shroud. If they don’t make sense, somebody should explain why. If my explanation is faulty, or my data incorrect, then I would like somebody to point out how (and they do – often! – see Kelly above and below!). And Kelly, yes, at least 80%, unless the original blood drips were so diluted as scarcely to be dignified by the name ‘blood.’ Look at ME 06, which is a photomicrograph of the “dense blood at the small of the back.” Not a single thread is obscured by particles – indeed, barely a single fibre. I submit that a drop of blood on a similar cloth, left to dry and ‘undisturbed’ (which has often been claimed by some researchers) would retain at least 5 times as much substance as we actually see.

As you will know from your own examination of Shroud 2.0, the “drop of blood” which appears between 1:50 and 2:15 in Part 5 of the You Tube video of your lecture to the Jesuit high School Tampa is indisputably a blob of red wax, and looks absolutely nothing like any of the reputed bloodstains. You accompany this photo with the words “…none of the clots are disturbed; they’re complete, perfectly shaped clots as they originally bled out into the cloth.” Actually, as you must know, every single bloodstain has been almost wholly erased, leaving minute particles of blood tucked into interstices of the fibres and threads, and a pinkish stain indicating their original extent. You may well have taken the photo from a shroud book in good faith, but it’s wrong. Regular readers of this blog will know that I very rarely accuse people of fraud or fabrication, and this misidentification is almost certainly an honest mistake, but that doesn’t make it less wrong. From 3:59 of the same video, you say: “So, the atoms disintegrate into all the components of the atom … and radiate 360 degrees in all directions. … But where is the shroud? It’s only at 180 degrees; it’s on the bottom, and it’s the top, so all the radiation going this way [indicates horizontally] doesn’t do anything about an image. Therefore no ears, no cheeks.” In this statement you cover two angles of radiation, not 360. If the tip of the nose, for example, emitted radiation in all directions (an expanding sphere of radiation, in fact), the radiation from that one point alone would contact the shroud as a disc of radius approximately 50cm, most intensely at 90 degrees (vertically above the nose) and diminishing towards the circumference of the disc. The trouble with this is, of course, that every other point on the body would do the same, producing an amorphous blur across the sheet. “These are accurately conveyed theories,” you say. Well, I’m sorry, but accurately conveyed non sense is still non sense, wouldn’t you agree?.","date":"2014-04-12","mins":"5:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/new-dvd-of-the-women-of-grace-programs-on-the-shroud-plus-some/","cat":"lectures","title":"New DVD of the Women of Grace Programs on the Shroud Plus Some"},{"id":"comment-70114","author":"hugh_farey","post":"What an interesting video. If, like myself, you found the first half rather dull, and didn’t watch the rest, it is well worth while continuing to the end. For me, a number of interesting points were made: 1) The absolute certainty with which the speaker introduced more and more speculative ideas about the walk to Calvary was interesting. I wonder how many of the less knowledgable of his audience assumed that what he said was archaeologically verifed. I appreciate that beginning every sentence with: “This is a tentative reconstruction based on very little” can be simply distracting, but as we got down to the precise details of how ropes were tied around Jesus’s legs, I did feel that he was pushing indisputablility further than was warranted. 2) It made me wonder about “shroud lecture audiences” generally. How many people attend who want to know all the information so that they can make up their own mind, and how many actually just want to be told what to think. I guess it may depend on the venue of the lecture. On this and other sites, we sometimes discuss the ‘argument from authority,’ and generally prefer an argument from evidence, but I fear there are many who not only accept that anything told them in a church must be true, but deliberately use their church as a way of not having to make up their own minds, but to have them made up for them. 3) At the end of the lecture, Donald Nohs goes into a much more interesting discussion of the Byzantine Rite liturgy (alhough by now we have no idea how accurately), and the idea that the ‘body’ is resurrected during the mass from the ‘antimention’ which is an image of the burial of Jesus on a small cloth that every Orthodox priest gets given on his ordination. (Western Rites use a ‘corporal’ instead of an ‘antimention,’ which I think confuses things a little.) Nohs’ point is that the liturgy contrasts the cross, which received the live body of Jesus and gave back the dead one, and the shroud, which received the dead body of Jesus and gave back the live one. Naturally, he would derive this liturgy entirely from the existence of the Shroud, while I am inclined to derive the existence of the Shroud from the liturgy. In other words, to paraphrase Voltaire, even if the shroud did not exist, it would be necessary to make one. I don’t know how old the ‘antimention’ tradition is, but Wikipedia tells me that every Orthodox altar has a ‘shroud’ (Strachítsa) that covers it permanently. Were there hundreds of ‘shrouds’ all over Constantinople, did the bigger and more important churches have the most impressive or realistic ones? I’m in deep water here for me. Anyone any comments? 4) Surely Donald Nohs hasn’t been saying ‘seplichre’ instead of ‘sepulchre’ all his life has he?.","date":"2013-12-30","mins":"9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/29/new-video-discovering-jesus-in-his-holy-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"New Video: Discovering Jesus in His Holy Shroud"},{"id":"comment-71706","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The readers of this blog collectively must have read every word and seen every foot of film relating to the Shroud.

Firstly, do not assume that non authenticists have not read the scientific arguments thoroughly. In my experience they not only have, but have done so rather more thoroughly than most authenticists. Secondly, do not assume that people on either side of the authenticism debate necessarily accept all the evidence that supports their point of view, or rejects all the evidence against it. Your first two examples are a case in point, as they had contradictory opinions on some points, so it would be illogical to agree with both. Thirdly, know your subject yourself, and do not expect the names of others, however eminent, to clear a path for you. Fourthly, be very specific. Scholars like to check detail.

Unfortunate, perhaps, but it is not a crime to have a fixed opinion, nor, given that the Catholic Church has no official opinion, a sin. Nor is there any moral or legal obligation for authenticists to listen to contrary opinions if they don’t want to. You must not be disheartened by this attitude, nor feel that you labour in vain. If you have any evidence that “the theory that Gnostics created the Shroud must be taken seriously because there is no other explanation for it,” then why not present it here? Although most of this blog’s followers are believers in the shroud’s authenticity, they are on the whole prepared to listen to and discuss all sorts of contrary opinions, some of them quite eccentric, provided they are supported by evidence, or at least references. The term “Gnosticism” seems to cover a very wide variety of ideas in a wide variety of contexts. It would be interesting to know a bit more specifically the who, when and where of your idea that Gnostics created the Shroud.

If the Shroud was made in the 13th/14th century, then somebody made it, and for a reason, and within some kind of cultural context in terms of representation. Thomas de Wesselow pointed out how unnecessary, and how untypical, is the faint image we see on the Shroud, compared to other “miraculous images”, and on those grounds decided that the Shroud wasn’t medieval at all. Charles Freeman agrees with de Wesselow that culturally the image on the Shroud does not look like a forged relic, but seeks another possible context. Paradoxically, while a “miraculous relic” need not have looked “realistic” at all, a stage prop might have gained credibility by being so. Colin Berry’s argument, that the Shroud was meant to look as if it was derived from sweat etc., actually fits better into Charles’s Quem Quaeritis scenario than it does into the forged relic one. There are problems. If the Shroud was much brighter and clearer than it is now, Charles needs to explain how such a uniform disappearance of pigment might have occurred, the apparent absence of any protein to bind the gesso, and the faint images that appear in copies. If the Shroud wasn’t much brighter and clearer than it is now, Colin needs to postulate a method of creating it. (To be fair, he has suggested several). I wonder if there isn’t a middle course – that the Shroud was created to look “realistic” by applying something which had the unexpected (or expected, if experiments had been carried out) effect of degrading the fibres, which when discovered, resulted in the Shroud being thoroughly washed clean of every other substance. Garlaschelli’s experiments with blue paint come to mind. Does old linen contain calcium in “relatively large” proportions? How did the S Tu RP team know what sort of proportions to expect? Colin suggests that “the calcium content of the Shroud is entirely consistent with the presence of pectins that survive retting.” Am I right in supposing that all flax contains some calcium before retting? And that the retting process removes some or all of it, rather than adding to it as Heller and Adler seem to suggest? In that case, I would expect most pre industrial linen to have a “relatively large” proportion of calcium compared to modern linen, which has sustained a more thorough retting. Is this in fact the case? As for Charles being a Historian or Colin a scientist, I’m not too bothered about nomenclature. Thanks to Colin I know a lot more about bilirubin and hemicellulose (and much more besides) than I did before, not because I took his word as gospel, but because he gave me ideas to check on elsewhere and on which to build ideas of my own. Thanks to Charles I know a great deal more about the Quem Quaeritis ceremony and the Zittau fastentuch, again, not because his word is law, but because his researches open a door through which other people may pass to discover more about them for themselves. Over the past few years, there has been, in my opinion, an over reliance on “experts” and a reluctance even to question them for clarification, let alone to disagree with them. To some people, Barbet, Bucklin, Heller, Adler, Rogers and/or several others have attained some kind of unassailable authority which renders any inquiry intio their work almost heretical. Thank goodness neither Colin nor Charles have joined them.

We have to find a 1400 AD conjunction of technical and cultural probability. The 3/1 herringbone seems characteristic more of north west europe than anywhere else, although any cultural characteristic both diffuses outwards from its heartland and also is occasionally simply carried elsewhere so crops up out of context. Otherwise, I have speculated on a Balkan heritage based on the epitaphios, or maybe an altar frontage or dossage, and Charles has suggested his mid European Quem Quaeritis idea. If middle eastern, then perhaps it is more likely to have been a deliberate forgery, maybe to feed the European ‘relic frenzy’, although, as I have also suggested elsewhere, 1400 AD was a little late in the day for that. I know nothing about the medieval Christian culture of Egypt or north Africa, but as you suggest, maybe that too would be worth investigating. Re Charles’s comment above: “the author just mentioned, in an aside, the Turin Shroud as a typical medieval painted linen as if there was no argument about it. She did not even think that she needed to say anything more.” This was Joanna Cannon & Caroline Villers, in the introduction to “The Fabric of Images” compilation (p. Ix), and the context in which they say it is worth reading. “Convenience was not the only motive and the paintings discussed in this collection raise intriguing issues of relative status and value. Were these works [paintings on cloth rather than wood] always conceived of as second best, as more conveniently portable alternatives to panel paintings, or as cheap substitutes for tapestry or embroidery? Might there be a positive spititual, cultic, value to painting on linen in, for example, Perugia, where fixed linen altarpieces may have intentionally recalled, by their appearance, the powerful efficacy of plague banners? Might such miraculous associations stretch even further back, to the example of Veronica, an image believed to have been miraculously imprinted on textile, or (less far back) to the Turin Shroud, itself one of the best known surviving medieval images on a textile support? Could a presumed modesty and cheapness in the choice of a textile support also carry desirable connotations of poverty which made the technique especially suitable for the Mendicant Orders? Did the rising appreciation of painterly skill in relation to material value cause a shift in the relation between painting on textiles and embroidery?” Etc, etc. The answer to all these rhetorical questions is, of course, we don’t know..","date":"2015-01-14","mins":"10:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"id":"comment-183246","author":"hugh_farey","post":"You’ve cost me a fortune Charles!

As a “true scientist” myself I am not only aware of the three papers you cite, but have read them carefully. That was why I asked the question – what do these people think caused the image? Apart from references to “a small quantity of energy” several times, and the absurdly overused word “stochastic,” there is a reference in all of them to “electromagnetic radiation,” but the rejection of UV and corona discharge. Taking the third paper, I do not think Jackson’s “Image intensity” equation can be converted to Fazio and Mandaglio’s “Energy absorption” equation as easily as they seem to think. Jackson could make an empirical measurement that the shroud had a background colour (Ib) which was further darkened by a supposed negative correlation between image and body/cloth distance (Io(1 z/Ro)). That there is a background colour is not disputed, but to supposed that it was caused (as in Fazio’s derived equation) by “the average energy received by the cloth by electromagnetic radiation” is wholly unfounded and unless explained further, almost meaningless. The rest of the equation also refers to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation from the body. Whatever it means, it is clear that “the little quantity of energy” postulated by Fazio is indeed, radiation. The paper makes a stab at the cause of the “little quantity of energy” by suggesting “emission of thermic energy.” Well, well. That’s heat to us “true scientists.” So, sorry, Anonymous, but in spite of a feeble attempt to attribute the source of their “emission of thermic energy” to “the low temperature chemical processes between reducing sugars and amine,” which surely could only occur actually on the surface of the cloth, the entire thrust of the paper is that the image is proportional to the intensity of radiation it received across varying distances. But it’s worse than that, even. It is assumed, wholly without justification, that there is a linear correlation between the energy transmitted from body to cloth and the distance it travels, which is wholly unjustified, and no consideration is given to the exact direction in which the radiation is supposed to have gone – vertically, horizontally, perpendicularly to body or cloth, shortest distance or any other. Finally, if Fazio and Mandaglio were really interested in Rogers’s vapour theories, they should have looked at equations regarding gas dispersal, not electromagnetic radiation intensity. P.s. If anyone is looking for a Peer Reviewer for this sort of stuff, I volunteer. P.p.s.

Their evidence that such a distribution exists at all is weak, their equation relating energy levels to distance radiated is unfounded, and their evidence that such low levels of energy can or do produce any effect at all is non existent. Their statement that “deterministic processes show great difficulty in the attempts to explain the Shroud body image. Therefore, they must be discarded,” is simply arrogant.

I understand the way you take unsupported assumptions as axiomatic, the way you use non sequiturs as a way of deflecting attention from contrary arguments, the way you reiterate opinions as facts and the way you assume vague generalisations to be logical conclusions. The variation of colouration of contiguous image fibres has almost nothing to do with the process of their degradation, and much more to do with the individual cellular structure of the fibres themselves. I can produce, and have produced, the discontinuous distribution of colour your describe simply by wiping a heated spatula rapidly over the surface of a piece of cloth. So could you, except that you are not a “real scientist.” You wonder why you waste time exchanging with me if I believe a hot statue could have produced the shroud image, without actually considering what I, or Fazio and Mandaglio, have claimed. They claim that the image could have been made by low level thermal radiation. They do not claim that this radiation must have come from a dead body – it could have come from anything, including a statue. If the image was made by some other process, then a hot statue may not be an appropriate alternative, but that’s not Fazio and Mandaglio’s conclusion. For what it’s worth, I have another experiment underway. Two pieces of cloth in my laboratory, one lying on a table, the other on a heater at about 45°C. Tomorrow I will place both of these in a hot oven, and inspect them every minute or so.
