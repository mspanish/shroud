That is why I occasionally mention the possibiity that the shroud may have started life as an altar cloth or reredos or epitaphios, from Eastern Europe (possibly North Eastern Europe), rather than a French painting. No success yet, but absence of evidence is not (not yet, I claim) evidence of absence.
