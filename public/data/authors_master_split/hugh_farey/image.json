The VP 8 was a clever machine for its time, and the thrill of seeing anything even resembling a face emerging from a flat background gave rise to wholly erroneous beliefs regarding the uniqueness, and the accuracy of depiction, of the image on the Shroud. In the cold clear light of 40 years later, we can find any number of images which are as good or better than the Shroud at achieving some sort of 3 D emulation, and it is obvious that the repoussé effect looks nothing like an accurately sculpted body. There have been several attempts to show that a draped cloth would allow better body cloth distance / image intensity calculations, but they have all failed dismally in practice (see both attempts in Ray Downing’s video), and an assumption that the Shroud was completely horizontal invariably gives the best results. With the possible exception of Petrus Soon’s images, however, it has always been assumed that the body cloth distance / image intensity relationship was linear, with a sharp drop off at about 4cm. Perhaps because of the difficulty of calculation, or the fact than none of the commonly used software provides for it, or the fact that such a method is even more difficult to explain using radiation or vaporograph hypotheses, but what has never been explored is the possibility that the relationship may not be linear at all. Petrus Soon’s website does not explain how he achieved the depth of field we observe in his images, and one may suspect that it was by art rather than science, but it is possible that he used a non linear relationship between distance and intensity. If so, that was his true achievement, not any of the pseudo holographic jiggery pokery that followed. Finally, Dan has it the wrong way round in saying that the 3 D effect “is the most important quality for knowing that these are not images formed by reflected light as a painter would envision or a camera would capture a human form.” By a country mile, the best explanation for the 3 D effect as it is seen, and the easiest way of replicating it, is to take a photograph, or paint a picture, using reflected light from the same point as the camera, such as a ring flash, preferably from some distance away, as demonstrated by Isabel Piczek on the top of her ladder, of a model immersed in a coloured liquid so as to attenuate the intensity appropriately.

However, they act as a powerful disincentive for for the authenticist cause, as they suggest that your views are wholly subjective and have little basis in actual observation. A passionate faith in the Shroud is an excellent thing (although one wonders what its subject would make of such invective) but unless it is controlled, it loses any scientific credibility. Is it any wonder that authenticists find themselves fighting a rearguard battle when one of their more authoritative spokesmen can do no better than that? This is a pity, because you might have a valid point. However, as you have no idea what image Colin was using, your very precise “16 pixel smoothing for 306×72 pixel image” is mere guesswork. When I try to explore Image J I try to begin with the biggest image I can. I select the brighter of the della Rovere images above (I find a good one at http://4.bp.blogspot.com/ k b PN Zi L84 A/SW Tn3o N7 Fj I/AAAAAAAAATM/vw I Rl6v P8l M/s1600 h/gbdrov.jpg) and enlarge it on my screen until the length of the Shroud almost fills the screen (I use a 13″ laptop). Taking a screengrab of that gives me an image of 1136 x 242 pixels. Feeding that into Image J and selecting the “Interactive 3 D plot” option, I get a good 3 D image with the following settings: Gridsize: 512, Smoothing: 4.0, Scale: 3.0, z Scale: 0.1, Max: 100%, Min: 0%. I agree that this image may be an artifact of the software, especially as the painting seems to be completely flat and without shading. However, if I carry out exactly the same procedure with the Shroud (using the image at http://www.world mysteries.com/sar 2wiki5.jpg), with a screengrab of 1168 x 292 pixels, and exactly the same settings, I get a remarkably similar picture. In neither picture did I make any adjustment to the colour, brightness, contrast or anything else. The truth is that it would obviously be best if the Smoothing was zero, but the “noise” over the Shroud makes it almost unrecognisable in that case. So is there any validity to your claim? Well, yes. I have also examined my two screen grabs with a Smoothness of zero, in which case the elevation above the background appears in both csses as a series of needlepoints, but this time I used the Spectrum LUT option, made the z scale 0.5, and adjusted the Max and Min values in an attempt to discern different heights of the needlepoints. Amost all the della Rovere needlepoints appear the same height, while the needlepoints of the shroud image do indeed show a variety of heights, lower at the edges of the image and higher in the middle. Both the VP 8 and Image J seem to have a smoothing function, which inevitably gives a slope even to sharp edges. Even at zero smoothing, the needle points in Image J appear as pyramids rather than rectilinear blocks. What we don’t know is how much smoothing has been applied to the VP 8 image; the observed curve of the legs and arms might be as much due to smoothing as to genuine image intensity. But then again, it may not..","date":"2014-12-13","mins":"5:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"id":"comment-176422","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Have a look at this.

My image was, of course quite crude, having only a school lab, a projector and a pupil to work with, so the smoothing was useful to create the realistic profile. The ‘contour lines’ are perhaps 5mm apart. Had they been 0.5mm apart, the face would have been much more recognisable and smoothing would have been unnecessary. However, what I was showing was that it is possible to create a 2 D brightness/elevation image which, when converted with appropriate software, actually looks like a head. The Shroud image cannot be made to do this, as it stands; it is far too flat. There are possible ways round this, as Mario has experimented with. If, for example, the Shroud 3 D Image were printed out by a 3 D printer in rubber, and the flexible sheet so printed were then curved (both longitudinally and latitudinally) over a solid oval template, then the resulting shape might resemble a head a little more. I imagine this is similar to what Soons and Downing were attempting digitally. There would be distortion of a different kind, but the overall shape would be a bit more realistic. This would be explained by authenticists in terms of the image being formed while the cloth was draped over the body, and not, as per Jackson and Piczek, horizontal. However then many of the distance measurements would be wrong, and the head have far too small a diameter to be a realistic image of a real person. You are of course perfectly correct that it is easy to do all this with hindsight, and that even if it were a medieval creation, it is unlkely that the artist was thinking in terms of 2 D 3 D image visualisation (or, for that matter, the power of the negative image), but it is sometimes assumed that the “incredible accuracy” of the 3 D possibility means that it would have been “impossible” for an artist to produce such an image. In fact, as we see, there is no “incredible accuracy” on that score, and so an artist cannot be ruled out on those grounds alone. There are, I agree, no contemporary parallels, but if a 13th/14th century artist did envisage a sheet covering a body and did create an image based on how he thought such an image may have come about, the rather crude an unrealistic 3 D effect we actually see is just what he might have come up with. If, on the other hand, the shroud was created by some form of emanation from a dead body, then so far (and Mario may well come up with an acceptable solution some day) the 3 D image cannot be reconciled with any brightness/distance correlation yet proposed, without being considerably subjectively distorted to fit the preconception. I’m afraid I find Kelly’s last comment ironic. “I think even a skilled artist working a priori and with hand held equipment would have screwed it up somewhere, at some point in the face, along the length of the body and some distortion/misalignment would be apparent.” To me, he did screw up, he did fail to appreciate a true brightness/distance correlation, and there is considerable distortion and misalignment, both in the face and along the length of the body..","date":"2014-12-15","mins":"8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"id":"comment-176936","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thanks, Mario. If I were an artist trying to represent a true body lying under a shroud, in terms of a brightness/distance correlation, I would be aiming to create something which (even though the technology to do so would not be invented for another 600 years!) would result in something like the top image if it were magically translated into a sculpture. If I ended up with something like the bottom image, I would realise I had not appreciated the true rightness/distance correlation, as the whole thing looks far too flat, more like a bas relief than a full sculpture. I have a great respect for your own paper “The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened” which I think illustrates that human body measurements are not badly distorted if a sheet is assumed to be draped, more or less as flat as it could be, but left to settle under gravity, but you do not address the brightness/distance correlation in that paper, by which all points of contact would be equally bright, and the sides of the cheeks (for example) would appear as high as the bridge of the nose. I think you were thinking of undertaking such a study, but have not heard how it progressed. Given the wonders of digital imaging, it should be possible to create a digital body (rather as Ray Downing has done), drape, wrap or lay a digital Shroud over it (which appears in several animations), and then calculate, convert into a coloured dot and plot, the distance between the body and the sheet in hundreds of places.

This indeed speaks of attrition of a most thorough and uniform kind, which I cannot attribute to rolling and folding even after 500 years. There is also the problem of the protein.

His scorches, like the Shroud image, or Roger’s ink blob, are a uniform colour, only lighter or darker. His concentric circle illustration does seem to use colour, perhaps for illustrative purposes only, but the same effect can achieved by piling concentric circles of exactly the same colour on top on each other, and varying the brightness of each one. It may be the that difference in brightness is caused by variation in distance. In Colin’s scorches it is mostly caused by variation in pressure, and one might surmise a situation in which variation in temperature played a significant part. Other factors may also be possible, such as variations in the conductivity in the scorching object. However, if we choose distance, we come across a significant question. Distance from what, to what, and in what direction? This has been explored, but not very deeply, and no consensus has been achieved even by brightness/distance devotees. Imaging software assumes two horizontal planes, representing maximum and minimum brightness, and builds its image between them, but few authenticists think that the Shroud was horizontal when the image was created. Attempts have been made to calibrate image intensity against a hypothetical body/cloth distance, always vertical, using photos of a body covered with a cloth, with some success, while the corona discharge hypothesis implies a “shortest distance” relationship, whether ot not it is vertical. Stan Walker, and also Todd earlier, falls back on the “if you can’t make one you must be wrong and I must be right” argument which it is surely time to retire.

That there is no direct correlation between intensity and distance is abundantly shown by simple 3 D imagers such as the VP8 and Image J – and even they require a level of smoothing and z axis adjustment which must be judged by the viewer. To create the three dimensional grid that Downing based his model on requires a great many assumptions and subjective overrides which it would be interesting to know. The first would involve deciding what exactly is meant by the cloth/body distance. The VP8 and Image J work from a horizontal plane, the darker the further. To get anything like a real head shape we have to assume that the shroud was in contact with the body at the hair, eyebrows, nose and beard (or at least equidistant from them) and so the cloth/body distance depends on the shape of the shroud. This shape has been brilliantly explored by Jackson, Lavoie, Latendresse and others, but is, in detail, quite subjective, as every time a sheet is placed over a body it adopts a slightly different drape. Following on from that, the problem of what to do about the folds of the drape, where there is too much cloth to fit neatly over the contours of the face, must also be considered, and this too is mostly subjective. Then there is the algorithm used to remove all the weave patterns and the various darker or lighter stripes that may be due to the bleaching process of the original flax fibres and the bloodstains. This too depends on the eye of the processor much more than on the unthinking soul of the computer… Basic 3 D information: yes.

I can only deal with a few here, and even then I must ask readers to check my sources for themselves rather than have everything laid out for them. 1) The halftone effect is largely a myth. OK’s attempt to demonstrate the representation of the halftone effect on the Shroud is made using a scanned halftone image from the cover of a book. Actually even that doesn’t work very well, but it is hardly surprising that a halftone image has a halftone histogram. Now look at Mark Evans’ micrographs side by side. In spite of different exposure and development, it is clear that the individual fibres on the darker parts of the Shroud image are darker than the individual fibres on the lighter parts of the image. The idea that all the coloured fibres are the same colour, and that the darkness of the image is achieved simply by massing more of them together is quite simply wrong. But don’t rely on me, check it for yourself by screengrabbing the micrographs from Shroud Scope and laying them side by side on a Word document or something similar. The differences are obvious. 2) The ‘banding’ between the cheeks and the hair is largely a myth. OK claims that there are two bands of lighter warp threads on either side of the face, and removes them with some digital manipulation to achieve his wider and more ‘realistic’ image. I invite the reader to try to track these light warp bands upwards and downwards beyond the extent of the Shroud face. It can’t be done. The two light bands are not a feature of the cloth, but a part of the image, and should not be treated differently by darkening them up. 3) OK’s comparison between my examples of 3 D qualities and the Shroud is grotesquely unfair. In Part 2, Slide about 18, OK places the Shroud and five examples of photos of forward facing faces lit from in front in a single group, and by manipulating Image J to suit the Shroud image as best it can, shows that the others are not as satisfactory as the Shroud image in 3 D terms. This is disingenuous. Why manipulate all the images using the Shroud’s parameters? They are all differently lit and have different contrasts. If each of the photos is made the best of (as they were in the post where I originally posted them) then it is easy to see that they are at least as good as, or better, than the Shroud image. That will have to do for now. OK’s paper is excellent in many ways, and is particularly ccommendable for its clarity, detail and references. It is, however, very selective as to its evidence, and few of its conclusions are altogether justified.

I do not say that my picture above is a perfect 3 D representation of my face. You have spotted that my ears appear to be at the same level as my cheeks, and that the irises and pupils of my eyes are too sunken in, for example. However I do say that my photo is a much better 3 D representation of a face than the Shroud is. Similarly, I do not say that there are no bands on the Shroud. There clearly are. What I do say is that these bands are not bands of differently coloured threads. They are made up of the different shadows of the two different directions of herring bone ribs, of clusters of threads of different thicknesses, particularly at the spines of the herringbone. They do not indicate that the cloth is differently coloured, so that some sort of correction factor needs to be applied to make the image more accurate. All that is needed to observe this is to magnify them using Shroud Scope – or better still Shroud 2.0. Furthermore, a photo by transmitted light owes rather little to the colour of the cloth itself. Even if every single thread were exactly the same colour, a transmitted light image would still show bands, as the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the thickness of the threads, which vary quite a lot. It is true that the fact that the Holland cloth is significantly banded (as can been seen by the bands appearing through the patches over the 1532 burn holes) and that those bands are clearly visible through the Shroud as well, does not preclude the possibility that the Shroud is also banded, but it does mean that the transmitted light photos cannot be used as evidence of that supposition.

From about 32:44 we are introduced to the problem that the ribs of the weave, which mostly carry the image, present a highly corrugated surface when converted to a 3 D image, and have to be removed by FFT, which searches for regular patterns and evens them out. The programme drifts off into history for a while, but the section concludes with more 2 D/3 D computer wizardry, using, guess what, the original image with all the weave marks left in. In the next section (45:59), there it is again, covering a 3 D image. Was the FFT not a good idea after all? The weave reappears here and there throughout the rest of the programme. At 46:33, John Jackson describes how “on the top part of the body the cloth meanders over the body in some fashion” following the contours of the body. This is accompanied by an image of what looks like a layer of pastry over a fruit pie, without a single crease or wrinkle, just bumps over the protuberances beneath. This is not how a cloth performs, as we see later on. This is followed (from about 65:50) with a couple of ingenious experiments to show how intensity/distance relationships could be translated into 3 D images, firstly assuming that Shroud was horizontal, and secondly assuming that it followed the contours of the body. The horizontal version wins hands down. With a horizontal Shroud “the result looks like a normal human face”, but the with the draped Shroud, “The face is distorted and flat, sunken in the middle and without a nose.” Oddly, the conclusion drawn from this is exactly the opposite of what has just been demonstrated. “Jackson has shown that the contours of the cloth are the source of Downing’s problem.” No, he hasn’t; he has shown that assuming the cloth to be horizontal gives the best 3 D representation. Nevertheless, the next section begins assuming that the draped Shroud works best, and reproduces the previous experiment using a sheet. Actually it is obvious that they are using something more like a ball than a human head, as the nose clearly does not stand proud of the cheeks, not are the eyes sunken in (see 49:45). This time, although, the results are completely different. Although they do not notice that big folds and creases in the cloth lift large sections away from the body, now all the hideous distortions observed the last time they tried it have disappeared, and “the figure looks more human”. Nor do they explain how they achieved the computerised figure from a cloth draped over a body. How were the body/cloth distances computed, and why is there no “mask of Agamemnon” effect, so that the hair strands down the sides of the face are not absurdly far apart? I’m afraid that I do not believe that this new image had anything to do with body/cloth distances. I suspect the Shroud face was simply ‘draped’ by computer, vertically downwards on to a pre existing digital head, and gently tweaked to get it to fit. That this is more likely is shown by the graphic at 50:05, where the contours of the 3 D image rise vertically from the 2 D image; they do not open out or unwrap. By 1:06:55, we abandon any pretence of objectivity. “For the computer graphics team, the search for the Shroud’s hidden face has been purely scientific’, but science can only lead them this far. To finish the face in the Shroud requires the skill of an artist.” At 1:08:00 we see the 3 D shape determined by the previous manipulations transformed again to make a more realistic contour for the eyebrows, as if somehow the original image was created through the eyebrows, which left no trace themselves. Later on, copious blood marks are added without specific reference to those all over the Shroud (although the epsilon appears prominently, there are no brow ridges to have caused it), but no suggestion of any broken nose or swollen cheeks that are often claimed for the 2 D/3 D representation (see 1:19:09). At the end of the programme Ray Downing takes a photocopy of a 3 D plastic model of his face, to see if he can reproduce an image similar to that of the Shroud. He produces a very narrow oval of the very front of the face (1:24:17), with no representation of the jawline of the cheeks or hair, but claims that his scan and the Shroud (1:24:19), “exactly match.” They don’t, of course. The features are in the correct spatial alignment, but the fall off in image as it recedes from the nose is huge in his model, and almost non existent in the Shroud. This is why the Shroud looks so much more as if it has been made from a bas relief than from a full 3 D head. Hardly surprisingly, his scan could easily be extruded into a 3 D face (1:24:57 – 1:25:05), as it came from a 3 D face in the first place, rather like the contoured face I have occasionally posted here myself. The Shroud, as we have seen only too often, doesn’t do this at all. I think Ray Downing has produced a good digital image, which no doubt could be made to walk about a CGI film very realistically, but I’m afraid that to claim it is any better or more accurate a representation of the man in the Shroud than has been created by numbers of sculptors just by looking at it, is unjustified..","date":"2015-09-26","mins":"1:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/26/the-vp8-cinderella-question/","cat":"3d","title":"The VP8 Cinderella Question"},{"id":"comment-1045","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I have bought ANOTHER microscope!

The warp threads are the ones which hang vertically in a loom, through which, by a system of heddles, the horizontal weft thread passes. On the shroud, the warp threads run longitudinally, and the weft threads transverse. Am I correct now in thinking that the photos show part of the shroud in its landscape, rather than portrait, format? So, as you say, the warp threads are prominent (at least on the front of the cloth, and in the pictures). I’m not sure it matters, but I’d like to clear it up. I can’t be sure from the Shroud Scope photos. Whatever the answer, there are corollaries I hadn’t thought of. If the markings are most prominent on the most prominent threads, then of course the back of the cloth, where most of those threads are hidden, would show very little discolouration. It would be interesting to see a bit of 3 1 twill woven entirely from black warp and white weft. Presumably it would be pretty dark grey on the one side, and pretty light grey on the other. The other observation, which I made before, is that any patch of Shroud Scope photo, image, non image or blood actually shows dark diagonal lines best, which are not marked threads at all, but the shadows between them. The threads themselves are quite pale. So whatever the surface of the threads is coloured with, the image we see on the photographs is primarily made of the dips and furrows where the mainly overlying threads dip under the underlying ones..","date":"2012-10-30","mins":"11:52 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/a-leisurely-thinking-aloud-appraisal-of-those-recently-released-shroud-photomicrographs/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"A leisurely, thinking-aloud appraisal of those recently-released Shroud photomicrographs."},{"id":"comment-1111","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Great links, Adrie.

The ‘stochastic’ school acknowledge this, and explain that at threshold levels, however small the attenuation of the radiation over the tiny distances involved, there must be a distance which acts as a boundary between the distance within which discolouration can occur, and a distance too far for any reaction. The ‘evaporation gradient’ school also acknowledge the problem, and say that a coating of dissolved chemicals evaporated away in such away that the chemicals were only left on the crown of the curves of the threads, so that although vapour from the body must have spread everywhere, only the crowns of the threads became discoloured by it. A mixture of these two ideas is quite tenable. The ‘contact’ hypothesis does not require either the delicately balanced radiation threshold or the all or nothing chemical concentration only on the crown of the threads.

Regardless of her undisputed eminence as a monumental muralist, Dame Isobel’s views cannot go unquestioned. 1) Her three main objections to the Shroud as a painting are that there is no carrying medium, no light source, and no outline. Anybody, artist or not, with a finger dabbed in powder paint, can produce an image with no medium, no light source and no outline in a very short time, especially if they are thinking of producing something resembling a contact print of a cloth laid on a body. The fact that my version looks nothing like the Shroud is nothing to do with the technique, but simply with my ability to visualise and represent the figure I’m attempting to image. Dame Isobel goes on to announce that there is absolutely no ’emulsion’ on the Shroud. She may well be correct. This is presumably derived from the S Tu RP findings that the image is entirely due to degradation of the fibres, and is, of course, in direct contradiction of Rogers’s thin layer of impurities. 2) Next, she lists in detail the knowledge and skills an artist must have mastered “inside and out” in order to produce a good image: anatomy, perspective, foreshortening, paint chemistry, mathematics and geometry. However, unless she had a phenomenal childhood, this simply isn’t true, as her own remarkable work at the age of 14 illustrates very well. The skills of observation, imagination and reproduction are paramount, and although they can no doubt be studied and mastered, any number of child prodigies demonstrate that they may be acquired almost innately. 3) From the foregoing list, Dame Isobel particularly concentrates on foreshortening, and makes the remarkable statement that the Shroud shows ‘strong’ foreshortening. I suppose the veracity of this depends on one’s definition of ‘strong’. To me, Mantegna’s “Lamentation Over The Dead Christ” and Dali’s “Christ of St John of the Cross” show strong foreshortening. The Shroud’s foreshortening, if any, is very weak compared to those, and could be produced entirely by observation, not by mathematical knowledge. Furthermore, the whole concept of foreshortening depends on angles between an object and an observer. If there is any foreshortening at all, this is evidence in favour of an artist, not against one. 4) Then we move on to the catacombs, and Dame Isobel’s assertion that the portraits of Christ with a beard that we find in them must derive from personal knowledge of what he looked looked like. However her statement that some of the paintings derive from the 1st century is highly questionable, and she conveniently forgets that most of the paintings show Christ entirely differently. I agree with her that even if the Shroud is authentic, early portraits in Rome cannot derive from it, but her idea that any of them can be assumed to reflect personal knowledge of Jesus is unjustified. 5) A couple of Dame Piczek’s later illustrations are not clear to me. An image said to be made of very diluted iron oxide with minimal binder actually looks like a piece of stained glass, with the lead borders clearly visible, and a variety of different colours, none of which looks like iron oxide. Is this in fact the correct illustration? 6) Now this I don’t understand at all. “It is always the paint particles which are inside [the] agglomerate, and the outside is the paint emulsion, while Mc Crone for instance claimed that he found inside of paint particles some kind of gooey yellow material.” Even Russ tails away in his attempt to make any sense of it. “What you’re saying here is that […] if it was paint you would have the actual pigment particles surrounded by the emulsion […] and not the opposite, and … and … OK, so …” Even he can see that this makes no sense, and is not, of course, what Mc Crone claimed. 7) Then we have the extraordinary idea that early descriptions of artistic methods, such as those of Cennini (and Pliny, interestingly), cannot be relied upon as accurate guides as their language is too archaic to be understood. Actually I don’t think that Cennini has a lot to say about a specific technique which might produce the Shroud, although I’m sure Charles Freeman would disagree, but the implication is that, if a modern artist were to produce a good replica of the Shroud using a technique described by a 13th or 14th century writer, it would not be valid as he would probably have misinterpreted the writer. That’s special pleading of quite a high order in my opinion. Incidentally, Mc Crone’s single mention of Cennini in ‘Judgement Day for the Shroud of Turin’ is as follows: “Both red pigments (red ochre and vermillion), the paint medium (collagen tempera), and faint monochrome images were popular with artists during the Middle Ages (Cennini 1437, Eastlake 1847).” Dame Isobel’s arbitrary dismissal of Mc Crone and others: “They don’t even understand what Cennini and Eastland were referring to” is mere snobbery. Eastland wrote in English but mostly gives his sources in their original, so that his translations can be confirmed if necessary. 8) Dame Isobel’s next point is that monochrome paintings of the kind illustrated by Mc Crone, such as those of Simone Martini in the Palais des Papes in Avignon, were only ever preparatory sketches for frescoes which would normally be laid over the top. In this Mc Crone does seem to have conflated some of the various monochrome styles of painting, from different times and different countries, described by Eastlake, but the fact that such a style of painting occurred at all, means that it was available as a means of creating the Shroud image..","date":"2015-07-26","mins":"8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/26/1999-interview-with-isabel-piczek/","cat":"image_theory","title":"1999 Interview with Isabel Piczek"},{"id":"comment-206651","author":"hugh_farey","post":"” What does a policeman do when he finds a corpse? He sends it to a pathologist! We only had one choice: asking the experts! Indeed not we alone, but all physicians and pathologists consulted by us and the international media were deceived: Prof. Cyril Wecht, Former President of the US Academy for Forensic Sciences, Home Office Pathologist Prof. Christopher Milroy of the University of Sheffield; Prof. Mihatsch, University of Basle/Switzerland; Prof. Dr. Carsten Nygren, Oslo; Prof. Dr. Pierluigi Baima Bollone, University of Turin; Prof. Jean Pierre, University of Paris, as well as a dozen pathologists shown the film by my colleague Luc Bürgin, a whole auditorium of Mexican physicians and professors of the University of Cluj/Romania, to which I showed the film, all believed the film showed a real corpse, not a dummy. The German dermatologist Dr. T. Jansen even wrote an article for the “Munich Medical Weekly”, claiming that the film shows a (human) girl suffering from Progeria. More than one critic claimed that Santilli exploited the corpse of a girl deceased from a genetic disorder out of sheer greed. ). If I am guilty of anything, than it is trusting in leading representatives of the medical profession. But who was more competent to judge an alien autopsy than a professional forensic pathologist?” From ‘Statement by Michael Hesemann, author of “Beyond Roswell”.’ (http://www.outtahear.com/beyond updates/Alien%20 Autopsy%20 Proved%20 Fake/STATEMENT%20 BY%20 MICHAEL%20 HESEMANN.htm) Daveb’s reliance on various pathologists convictions that the photos they were looking at were of real people is not unreasonable, any more than those UF Ologists who concluded that the Roswell autopsy was genuine on the basis of professional forensic pathologistical concurrence. However, I do not think that any of the Shroud researchers would have said, if asked, that it could not possibly be a painting. What they all said was that it was sufficiently accurate to represent a real body. In his ‘Autopsy Report’ for example, Dr Robert Bucklin does not discuss the possibility that it might not be at all. We have already discussed at some length that Dr Fred Zugibe thought that Dr Pierre Barbet’s anatomy was seriously deficient, and mentioned that Dr Norman Lee thought that the evidence clearly showed that the man had been buried alive, or that Dr Michael Baden didn’t think that the Shroud could have covered a real body. None of these people, except possibly Baden, were particularly concerned about whether the images they were shown could have been artificially made, but prepared to treat the image from the start as if it were genuine, and work from there. Anatomical deficiencies, which many of them noticed, were not therefore considered as evidence of artificiality, but were carefully explained from a forensic viewpoint, so the arms were dislocated, or the man was angled this way or that because of rigor mortis, or he was laid on a pillow of some kind, or he had Marfan’s syndrome. Curiously, the few forensic pathologists who have examined the shroud in intimate detail, Drs Eugenia Rizzati, Emilio Mari and Giovanni Judica Cordiglia, do not appear to have considered the anatomy of the image at all. I do not want to get into a “my pathologist is better than your pathologist” squabble, and i agree with daveb that in general they treat the Shroud as if it was a photograph of a dead body, but I do not think that that means that it could not be an artifact. As for the rest of the comment above, daveb treats my remarks as if they were replies to quite different questions, rather than comments on Dame Isobel Piczek’s video. She does not mention pathologists at all. She does say that it is impossible to produce a portrait without binder, light direction or outline, and she is wrong. She does say that there is no covering on the Shroud, which conflicts with Rogers’s impurity layer. She does say that no such painting could be produced without mastery of a number of disciplines, all of which she appears to have managed herself by the age of 14. She does say that the Shroud shows ‘strong’ foreshortening, when it doesn’t, and so on. All this challenging to do this or that like a game show is contrary to any kind of objective study. Do I prove that the Shroud is a fake because nobody can produce a similar one made by a dead body? Does the uniqueness of an artefact prove a supernatural origin? Of course not. As for what I claim or do not claim, well, for a start it hardly matters, but for what it’s worth, I am currently swayed towards some kind of artificial creation, more probably by imprinting than the use of a paintbrush specifically, and inclined to the view that much of the original material has been deliberately removed, leaving degraded fibres, not unlike the manner described by Guarlaschelli.

The whole cloth, including “in regions of the image”, fluoresces. The image merely suppresses the fluorescence slightly.

If there is any truth in these discoveries, a much clearer demonstration of how they were achieved will be necessary. Some researchers will be happy to accept all the pareidolia at face value, but we are next boldly informed that the body was lying face down on the Shroud, which will surely be a surprise to almost everybody. The justification for this is: “The position of the hair, the hollows of the face between the cheeks and mouth, the slope of the cloth from the right leg towards the left due to gravity, the position of the arms and wrists on a single plane and other details indicate that the force of gravity was towards the front of the body.” I don’t accept any of that at all, and could easily demonstrate the reverse. The rest of the video attempts to show that Jesus was buried wearing various garments and adorned with religious ornaments, which, during the course of the image forming process, moved, producing successions of images of the same objects on the Shroud, rather like stroboscopic photos of objects in motion.

As a bit of a side line it is revealed that the Sudarium of Oviedo, rather than being folded in two and wrapped around the face, was in fact folded into eighty layers and placed under the brow, thus holding the face slightly off the plane of the cloth. This is highly disputable. There are some ingenious descriptions of how double images of the hands could have resulted in the image that we all observe, although the details, again, rely on pareidolia of a fairly extreme kind. The video ends with a poorly argued attempt to explain how parallel radiation can emerge from a point source.

In “Judgement Day for the Shroud of Turin”, Walter Mc Crone devotes an entire book to his observation of iron oxide particles in sufficient quantities to account for the image on the Shroud without the need for any vapours, radiation or even cellulose decomposition. He also observes vermillion particles and the remains of the collogen binder. Rogers, and S Tu RP generally, utterly denied that any of these observations were accurate. However, in a single sentence, Mc Crone mentions various minor impurities he also found: “silk, wool, linen and cotton fibres of various colours, wax spatters, bird feather fibres, rodent hairs, mica, limestone (calcite), quartz, aragonite, starch grains (corn and wheat), pollen (average less than 2 3 pollen grains per tape), mold sores, trichomes (leaf hairs), flyash (oil soot, power plant, incinerator, trash burning), Jeweler’s rouge, paper fibres, pigments (madder, orpiment, yellow ochre, azurite), paint fragments (titanium white, ultramarine, yellow ochre), plant and insect parts, charred linen fibres, etc.” From this list, Roger’s seized upon two words as substantiation of his idea that the entire shroud was coated in a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities. In “A Chemical Investigation into the Shroud of Turin”, Heller and Adler list the tests they carried out on a wide range of fibres in order to determine any extraneous material. They report their tests in three groups: ‘proteins and heme derivatives’, ‘metallic species’, and ‘organic species and functional groups’. This last included tests for phenols, riboflavin, steroids, indoles, lignin (allyls), starch, porphyrins, pyroles, creatinine, uric acid, urea derivatives, primary amines, nitro derivatives, aldehydes, cellulosic carboxyl and Saponaria extrract. “With the exception of positive aldehyde and cellulosic carboxyl tests, all other species tested for tested negatively.” Rogers conveniently decided to ignore these negative results, particularly those for starch, Saponaria or urea derivatives, although he devotes an entire paragraph in “A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin” to the negative lignin test, which he accepts. However, I was wrong in my remembering diimide as a protein rather than a carbohydrate removing agent. The point I wanted to make was that Heller and Adler noted that the darker the image, the more corroded the fibril carrying it appeared. They classified their samples into various groups, of which the following descriptions are relevant: – Pale yellow fibrils (non image areas) – Surfaces appear slightly corroded under phase contrast. – Yellow fibrils (body image (non blood) areas – Surfaces appear corroded under phase contrast. – Dark fibrils (Scorch areas) – Surfaces appear very corroded under phase contrast. In addition to this they report that after removing any protein from the blood areas with a proteolytic enzyme, the fibrils beneath looked like non image fibrils. None of this concurs with Rogers’s view that the entire image resides on a thin layer of impurities, beneath which the Shroud material itself is unaffected. “I think it’s you who selects just what comforts your point of view!” In this respect I don’t have a particular point of view. All I want to do here is to point out the inconsistencies between various scientist’s observations. Maybe Rogers is right and Adler is wrong, or maybe it’s the other way round. Maybe Mc Crone was right all along.

Paolo di Lazzaro’s laser discolouration of linen fibres exactly replicates the colour and depth of penetration observed on the Shroud, and that is all he claims, not that his way is the only possible way, or that there is any known way in which an exploding body can produce such radiation. Similarly, Rogers has no qualitative explanation of how a recently dead body can produce any of the vapours he thinks responsible for the discolouration of his starch layer. You praise Roger’s for gradually developing his ideas regarding image formation, and condemn others for starting with pre conceived ideas, but I think this is unjustified and unfair, and part of the cult of Rogers worship that typifies most of your posts.

In “Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge” he specifically addresses Rogers’s observations of fibres irradiated with various things as illustrated in “The Shroud of Turin: Radiation Effects, Aging and Image Formation”, and shows that mild coronal discharge does not cause the defects that Rogers thought it must. It is interesting that although Fanti profoundly disagreed with Rogers on almost everything, he explained his reasons for disagreement courteously and in detail, and concluded: “Many thanks to the late Raymond Rogers who by means of hundreds of e mails exchanged with G. Fanti made it possible to study and compare in depth the CD effects on linen fibers with those of the TS and who was so kind as to give to G. Fanti a piece of sticky tape classified as STURP 1 EB that was very useful in understanding some of the very particular characteristics of the TS image fibers by direct detection.” This courtesy and co operation in the presence of deep disagreement is the hallmark of true science.

In particular, it was his observation (which may have been mistaken) of evidence of discolouration on both sides of the Shroud that led him to explore the development of an idea first proposed in 1984. You have also clearly not read di Lazzaro’s explanation of how he came to explore his UV laser ideas. And you are being over selective about your criticism. Of course there are lots of things wrong with di Lazzaro’s hypotheses; neither I nor he deny that; but there are also lots of things wrong with Rogers’s ideas as well, and they are very similar, namely that Rogers has nothing to say about how an appropriate amount of ammonia can be emitted from a recently dead body, just as di Lazzaro (or Fanti) does not explain how an appropriate amount of radiation can be emitted. In short, a number of possible image formation hypotheses have been suggested by a number of researchers, and none of them are sufficiently comprehensive or sufficiently well demonstrated to be considered definitive.

However, David Mo pointed out that these changes were already beginning in the 11th century, and you agreed, now suggesting that the “dramatic change” began then, when “noble Latin guests” visited the Imperial Court in Constantinople during the Crusades. The dramatic change now takes over 300 years, which weakens the force of the word “dramatic,” don’t you think? There was quite clearly, by your own admission and by the evidence of your own paper, no “sudden manifestation” of anything. The 1239 purchase of the Crown of Thorns did not inspire a dramatic change, it was in the middle of a very gradual change. The appearance of the Shroud in Lirey in 1350 or so came towards the end of this change. Similarly, I can’t follow your argument regarding the number of nails. Firstly you claimed a 12th to 14th century change from 4 to 3, based on the Shroud, but claimed that Byzantine crucifixes ignored the Shroud in favour of Queen Helena’s discovery of 4 nails. When I said that this was as well known to the West as to the East, you now say nobody knew how many nails were discovered after all! It all narrows down to your claim that Western crucifix makers in 1150 knew more about the appearance of the Shroud than Byzantine crucifix makers.

However, I understood the point of his research was to show that the appearance of the Shroud ignited a transformation in depictions of the crucifixion, from four to three nails, adding the crown of thorns and so on. Having accepted that this transformation was not sudden, one is at a loss to try to pinpoint when the Shroud began to have this effect. Clearly not its appearance at Lirey, as the transformation had begun two hundred years before. If Robert de Clari’s observation in 1204 identifies the Shroud in Constantinople, that’s still a hundred years after the great transformation began. The putative arrival of the Shroud in Constantinople in 944 would be a possible start date, but how strange then that Byzantine crucifixion iconography into the midst of which the Shroud had suddenly appeared, showed no indication of its existence (such that it is excluded from OK’s examination), while Western European sculptors recognised it immediately. This is all rather inconsistent. I don’t accept that the Shroud was somehow hidden from the Byzantines but exposed to tourists from Europe, nor that the four nails of Helena had anything to do with it, as they were as well known to Western Christianity as to Eastern. I also mentioned in an earlier response to OK that I was not convinced by his explanation for the wrong foot being atop. The Shroud clearly shows a wound in the right side and a left foot atop. Artists could either follow this (assuming, as we do, that the Shroud was a mirror inversion), or reverse it (assuming that the Shroud was a straight painting), but in fact the crucifixions said to be derived from it show the wound in the right side but the right foot atop. To reverse one but not the other, on the basis of convoluted biblical interpretation, is pushing credibility, I feel. A similar argument to the one above applies to the Crown of Thorns. Unless a truly dramatic change in depictions occurred suddenly after 1239, it’s purchase by Louis cannot be said to have had anything more than a ‘booster’ effect on something that had been slowly changing for years.

The dismissal of the protocol and the selection of the site was nothing to do with them. When the results were collected, “the spread of the measurements for Sample 1 [was] somewhat greater than would be expected from the errors quoted.” Now the statisticians took over, and there has been erudite but inconclusive disagreement of the “my statistician is better than your statistician” type ever since. The Nature authors submitted their calculations to Prof. Bray of the Istituto di Metrologia in Turin, and Remi van Haelst submitted his to Dr Leese of the British Museum and Prof. Jouvenoux of the University of Marseille Aix. Then Riani and Atkinson carried out their analysis establishing the statistical likeliness of a chronological gradient. But what does all this mean? All the results came out between 1200 and 1400, during the last 50 years of which the Shroud is known to have been in existence. That in itself is sufficient, as all the statisticians well know, totally to rule out a 1st century date (based on the radiocarbon data alone). It is interesting what while several papers have been written saying that the 95% confidence range is wrong, none have suggested a value that might be correct, based on the statistiics at hand. It would not include the first thousand years AD. Prof di Lazzaro is well aware of that and so is careful not to commit himself to a denial. “— Can they challenge the demonstration that the image has nothing to do with scorch?” The definition of a scorch changes almost daily on this blog, but ultimately comes down to a decomposition of the linen with concomitant discolouration. Di Lazzaro sensibly thinks that draping a cloth over a full size heated statue and removing it again may take too long for merely superficial effects to appear uniformly. The critical factors seem to be the intensity of the ‘heat’ and the duration of its application. Essentially all his experiments are, in fact, attempts to scorch cloth in such a way as to reproduce the discolouration and superficiality of the Shroud image. “— What can they say about the Maillard effect, which even Ray Rogers felt was just a hypothesis, and which I challenged?” I don’t think they say anything about the Maillard effect at the moment. It needs considerably more verification before there is anything to be debated. “— Can they show where paint comes into the picture?” Yes and no. If paint or pigment was originally involved, there certainly seems to be very little of it left. Mc Crone’s iron oxide, and various more scattered particles, may or may not have anything to do with it. “— Can they write a paper about how dye was involved?” I myself have wondered if the chronological radiocarbon gradient might have been due to a dye applied to the Holland backing cloth to make it match the shroud, especially in the ‘missing corners’ area. I don’t think anyone has said much more, have they? “— Can they write a paper about how some kind of ink was used?” See entry under paint. “Lastly,they will have to write a paper, preferably a peer reviewed one, taking on all the special characteristics in the image, as described in the interview.” No, they won’t. Di Lazzaro is a proper scientist, and rightly points out not only that his experiments do not show the “only” way of discolouring the cloth appropriately, but also that the energy involved in creating the entire double image is “out the realm of science. As scientists, we feel uncomfortable when dealing with a body emitting a hypothetical ultrashort burst of VUV radiation having a peak power and a fluence equivalent to the contemporary emission of, say, ten thousand excimer laser shots. A miracle would be necessary, which cannot fit into any current scientific paradigm.” Di Lazzaro’s are interesting, but are nothing like the last word on the subject, as he himself would be the first to agree..","date":"2015-03-19","mins":"12:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/17/a-shift-drift-in-colin-berrys-thinking/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Shift-Drift in Colin Berry’s Thinking?"},{"id":"comment-193731","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Hi Louis, I think Paolo di Lazzaro’s interview is a model of restrained scientific observation, but I am at a loss to find a gauntlet.

I think I was wrong, actually, anoxie, as Remi van Haelst does calculate a corrected 95% confidence level in his ‘Radiocarbon Dating The Shroud’ which is 504 – 859 BP. This corresponds to about 1150 – 1440 AD. So a critical dismissal of the competence of the Nature statisticians, and reworking of the data from the start by a more rigorous method still totally precludes a 1st century date for the Shroud. Thibault, after reading Rogers’s accounts of gums and dyes and so on, it occurred to me that when the Holland cloth was first attached, it made a brilliant white contrast to the faint yellow of the Shroud, and may have had a small amount of colouration added at the corners, and possibly at the poker holes to try to make it blend in. I speculated that where the Raes and radiocarbon samples were taken from, the Holland cloth underneath would retain its white colour, which indeed is the case, as Rogers’s “Scientific Method Applied to the Shroud of Turin”, Figure 18, and “http://www.holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/1309358 orig.jpg” illustrate.

Actually I think that there is a contamination gradient, as demonstrated by Riani and Atkinson, and that the contamination produced an older date than the actual one, as demonstrated by Ray Schneider. Given that hypothesis, the radiocarbon data still suggest a date between 1150 and 1440, or in this case a little narrower. What I think would be useful would be for a statistician to start from the raw data, accept the hypothesis that the samples were chronologically contaminated, and work out what can be determined about the age. I think he will find that the limits of 95% probability are still 1150 to 1440, and that any date from before 1000 AD can be wholly ruled out.

I have never achieved disclouration. Question 2 – Even if some sweat compounds could change the colour, could sweat absorption discolour only the most superficial fibres of the cloth without soaking in and reacting with the whole thread.? This was one of Ray Rogers’s main problems, and led him to postulate the ‘evaporation gradient’ layer, whereby the vapour or fluid from the body could penetrate the whole cloth, but was so unreactive that only the uppermost surface, where the layer was, would be discoloured.

How often did they use spikes to fasten people to the crucifix? Were criminals required to carry a part of the cross the the execution site? Were all corpses wrapped in a cloth?” As far as I know there was very little that might have distinguished Jesus’s crucifixion from thousands of others. It does seem that crucifixion was a particularly popular Roman punishment in 1st century Israel, and, judging by the various descriptions of it (and two rather badly drawn pictures) that there was no universally standard way of doing it. No doubt, however, individual fortresses had conventions that they usually followed, and I suppose Jesus was crucified without any special attention. There is no reason to suppose that the flogging, the carrying of the patibulum to a fixed upright and the iron nails were anything other than normal. Even the crown of thorns (which may be a specific reference to his ‘crime’ of kingship) and the spear thrust (saving the bother of breaking the legs of one already dead) may not have been unique, or even uncommon; we just don’t know. As for the shroud, the gospel of Mark says Joseph of Arimathea went out and bought a linen sheet, and Matthew says it was ‘new.’ This sounds ordinary enough, although the curious side hem and the definitely more expensive herringbone weave suggest that the relic we have today (if genuine) may not have been quite run of the mill – then again perhaps Joseph felt Jesus was worth a classier shroud than normal. I don’t know how many shrouds from the 1st century Middle East have been found, but I imagine that the preservation of any of them was quite unusual, as the decomposing contents would have made a mess of most of them quite quickly, I suppose. Some, I dare say, have been found unused, which itself would account for their being no images on them, and others may have been wrapped around mummified or dried remains. I imagine that the removal (and retention) of a shroud from a recently buried person would have been quite rare. As to there being “absolutely no indication of artistic meddling on the shroud,” a simple yes/no response isn’t really adequate. A number of possible pigments have been identified, but not in sufficient quantities to create an image, and the image itself is either the degraded fibres of the shroud itself, or, as most recently suggested, a layer of degraded carbohydrate coating the fibres, or at least some part of some of them. In spite of Thomas de Wesselow’s convincing treatment of the lack of technical, stylistic or cultural coherence with 14th century art, it is not impossible that the degradation was made artificially. Either a degrading process was applied directly (similar but not identical to rubbing a hot metal plate quickly across the surface, or irradiating the material with UV or some such), or some other process, now washed off or otherwise removed, had the side effect of degrading the carbohydrate and leaving the image behind. “Wouldn’t they have wanted recognition as a genius? Wasn’t Christianity already a major religion? What was the motivation?” Not necessarily, Yes it was, and Money (in that order). Again with respect to de Wesselow, who shows how unnecessary it was to go to such trouble to fake a relic, such things were huge tourist attractions throughout the middle ages, and any church which had a good collection was guaranteed a steady income. It was in nobody’s interest to recognise the genius of the man who made them, as it would prove they were fakes! I’m glad you ‘butted in.’ Thinking it was obvious is the way many of us first became interested in the shroud, and finding it not as obvious as we first thought, became deeply entangled in the various threads of its uncertainties.

One problem with the supernatural is that it is well nigh impossible to distinguish it from the unexplained. There are many, many aspects of the shroud which remain unexplained, but that does not necessarily make them good reasons for associating anything ‘supernatural’ with it. Another, equally difficult aspect of the supernatural is that, not being constrained by physics, as it were, it is capable of anything at all, and a guess that the image was formed by a burst of atomic radiation is as good as guessing that the entire shroud was created ex nihilo on the morning of the resurrection, while other associated grave cloths simply dematerialised. Distinguishing which of the two is more likely is more of a philosophical than a scientific question. Another aspect of the inquiry is whether ‘supernaturalism’ might be expected to ‘rub off’ onto things associated with supernatural people (if so I might describe Jesus), in the way that forensics scientists claim that ‘every contact leaves a trace.’ This too is more of a philosophical than scientific question, but is worth exploring. A pair of Mahatma Gandhi’s sandals was recently auctioned near me, and fetched £19 000. They are worn and tatty, and had they belonged to anybody else would have been thrown away long ago, but they have a kind of ‘Gandhiness’ about them which makes them valuable. In that context, the very fact that the shroud is so venerated might be evidence that it has a ‘supernaturalness’ about it, that an ordinary cloth acquired from a supernatural person by association. Trouble is, of course, that in these cases provenance is all. If it were demonstrated suddenly that Gandhi had in fact never worn the sandals, or that the shroud of Turin was a 16th century copy, then the ‘Gandhiness’ of the one, and the ‘supernaturalness’ of the other, would disintegrate completely, suggesting that these qualities, even if they are genuine, lie in the minds of observers rather than in the objects themselves..","date":"2013-07-20","mins":"5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/20/any-good-reasons-for-associating-anything-supernatural-with-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Any good reasons for associating anything supernatural with the shroud?"},{"id":"comment-92335","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Another good crease to ponder on extends vertically upwards from the wrist wound.

It does not extend beyond the fringes of the hair, and although there are a few imperfections in the weave along its length, they appear to me to be the results of the creasing rather than the cause of it. B) Just above the brows. This has all but disappeared, although faint traces of double lines are just visible above the ‘3’ blood stain. C) Upwards from the wrist. This appears to be a single dark line embedded in the weave, almost as if it had seeped through from the back. Another ‘double line’ is apparent in a vertical direction on the abdomen almost in the midline of image. Although in close up it looks like differential bleaching in the various warp threads, it is only a few centimetres long, when one might expect that kind of imperfection to run the whole length of the warp threads involved..","date":"2014-03-24","mins":"1:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/23/baked-in-creases-really/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Baked-In Creases.

I am persuaded that there was no medieval artistic heritage or tradition within which the shroud as a ‘forged relic’ could comfortably fit. Either a blank sheet or an obvious painting would have done just as well. However, I think it could fit into a North Balkan tradition of the epitaphios, which originated around about the 13th century, and is associated with large cloths and (originally) ‘realistic’ images of the dead Christ. Although early versions of the epitaphios are hard to come by, they seem to concentrate more on the cloth and the body than do the later ones, which tend to fill up with background figures of angels and apostles. As for Jesus ‘getting up and walking out,’ this is one of the few interpretations of the resurrection that requires that the stone be rolled away from the tomb.

This is a transmitted light photo, which shows no image at all, on the face or anywhere else. As the light is coming through from behind, all the light and dark variation is caused by the thickness of the cloth at any point, which includes the backing cloth. There is no distinction in such a photo between the visiblity of the warp and weft threads. There is virtally no evidence of transverse bands (as opposed to individual threads) on the left hand side (where the ventral upper body image is), but several quite distinct ones on the right (where the ventral feet image is). The most prominent are two dark bands at the level of the hands. One of the lamps illuminating the cloth is immediately behind the image of the forehead, and shows two thin dark longitudinal stripes which can be traced to the middle of the cloth and possibly on down towards the feet. Three other interesting observations may be made of this photo. As so many of the stripes, both longitudinal and transverse, can be clearly seen from one side of the cloth to the other, we have prima facie evidence firstly that any repairs, invisible or otherwise, even in the area of the radiocarbon sample, do not constitute a significant proportion of the cloth. Secondly, the fact that the transverse stripes are so continuous even across the seam of the side strip suggests to me, as it has to others, that the seam is not a joining of two pieces but a tuck in a single sheet; and thirdly, the darkness of the shroud compared to the lightness of the patches (almost the same colour in normal light) shows how dense and heavy the shroud weave is..","date":"2014-08-27","mins":"12:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding?

I may agree heartily – I just don’t know. I have, however, spent some time studying the alleged banding on i Pad’s Shroiud 2.0. It is really most instructive. Take, for example, what appears in the Enrie negatives as a thin white stripe running vertically down the face, from the drop at the end of the epsilon bloodstain, through the eye, cutting off a chunk of moustache and just missing the lip. (A good place to see it in closeup is at http://www.artfinding.com/images/svv/2/325/cav g. enrie turin  il santo volto le saintsuaire 109 1.jpg). We might suppose that it is a single dark warp thread, running more or less the length of the Shroud. In Shroud 2.0, however, we see what it really is, namely a small group of three or four warp threads which have become bunched together during the weaving process, producing a tiny ridge of threads longitudinally down the Shroud (and a tiny trough the other side) which in turn casts an anomalous shadow. In other words, the bright distinctive stripe on the Enrie negative is simply an artifact of the weave, and not, in fact, a dark stripe at all. An inch or so further out is the sharp division between light and dark that appears responsible for the vertical cut off of the cheek, and forms one side of the area that Barrie Schwortz photoshopped upwards to remove the apparent ‘band.’ In Shroud 2.0 we can see that this line is the spine of one of the ‘herringbones’ and that these spines are often anomalies in the regular smoothness of the shroud, and although they appear as white stripes on the Enrie negative, they are artifacts of the light. In fact, the more we try to pin down what, precisely, makes the dark bands appear so, the more we find that the borders between the bands correspond with the herringbone ‘spines,’ and the more we wonder if the angle of the light wasn’t responsible rather more than any real discolouration. And, yes, sound waves can create ripples in all sorts of things, including fabrics, and no, nothing at all like the markings on the Shroud!.","date":"2014-08-27","mins":"5:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding?

Thus the entire Shroud is covered in alternating lighter and darker bands. This pattern is not seen on the Durante photo. Here the various longitudinal stripes seem to me to be much thinner, where you can see them, and appear to be related to the ‘spines’ of the herringbone ribs, which may have formed into slight ridges or troughs as part of the rolling up process. I cannot find a good positive Enrie image, but the large scale negatives, which can be found at the link above among others, show a variety of bands, some very thin and some as thick as a width of a pitch. However they are much less consistent and the thick ones do not appear to be lighting artifacts as they sometimes extend over two or three bands of alternating pitch. It is not clear in any case that the pale vertical areas defning the sides of the cheeks, or the dark vertical areas defing the fall of the hair, are due to imperfections in the weave or the lighting of a photo rather than the shape of the image model itself. As such, attempts to ‘correct’ the image by removing them are probably misguided..","date":"2014-08-28","mins":"3:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding? Is it Real?"},{"id":"comment-146495","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think the bottom line here is that the Shroud face has a rectangular quality that is rarely if ever seen in ancient or medieval portraits of Christ. Both cheeks are delineated by paler vertical stripes, neatly symmetrical on either side, with darker vertical stripes of hair outside them. Byzantine and other portraits show a more triangular or oval face, with the hair moulded to it. The question is, how important is this observation? To some, the overall shape of the face and the blocks of hair are the most obvious and recognisable features of the face on the Shroud, with the implication that if they do not appear on purported copies, then their identity can be denied. To others, an apparent ‘congruence’ of a number of minor features is more important, and suffiicent to establish identity, regardless of the shape of the face and hair. (To me, a man with a bushy moustache and beard, the droopy tapering spindles of moustache found on Byzantine portraits is quite sufficient to discredit them entirely. It is interesting how different people have different perceptions of what is significant and what less so.) To a few, the vertical stripes must be ‘explained away,’ as if would be copiers, recognising that the vertical stripes were artifacts of the cloth, permitted themselves to ignore the rectangular shape of the Shroud face and to draw a more conventional tapering jaw of their own without compromising the identity. So what are the pale vertical stripes separating cheeks from hair? Are they obstructions placed on either side of the face which prevented image formartion? Or could they be made of threads which were either paler than the others to start with, or prepared in such a way that they were less susceptible to the image making process, whatever it was? And how can that be demonstrated? One way of establishing the existence of ‘banding’ is by examining Barrie Schwortz’s transmitted light photos, which conveniently eliminate the image completely. These are indeed clearly vertically and horizontally striped in light and dark stripes of varying width and intensity, although these variations are probably more closely related to the thickness of individual threads than their actual colour. The transverse ones clearly stretch right across the cloth, and the longitudinal ones can be traced for at least a metre or so. This cannot be seen on the Shroud itself at all. The apparent banding across the mid part of face (hair gap cheek gap nose gap cheek gap hair, or dark light dark light dark light dark light dark) is not extended upwards or downwards. We should not be surprised at this, as there is no reason why the thickness of the threads (transmitted light banding) should be related to their colour (reflected light banding). There is the added consideration that the transmitted light was coming through the backing cloth as well, which must have added to the effect. I do not know how Robert Doumax achieved his effect. There must, I think, be a fair amount of subjectivity to it (just as in Schwortz’s abitrary patch lightening above), and would not able to consider its accuracy without applying it to other parts of the shroud, not just the face. Finally, as I have said before, one might predict that the irregular processing of the raw thread could lead to visible banding on a cloth, but in that case there would be irregular banding patterns longitudinally, as the warp threads would be made from separate individual hanks, and broad regular bands transversely, as each weft single hank was used up going backwards and forwards across the loom. This is not what we observe..","date":"2014-08-27","mins":"7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/27/banding-is-it-real/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Banding?

Even at its coarsest (Try a Grid Size of 32 and and no Smoothing), when one might expect the result to be a series of square based towers, the programme produces pyramids, whose slope seems to depend on the surrounding pixels.

I would like someone to tell me whether a lepton (about 1 cm across) would have been enough to prevent the eyes opening, or not. They are very light, and I would have thought, useless for that purpose. When people were laid out in front rooms in England (perhaps they still are) copper pennies were used, which are about 3cm across and quite substantial. I put ‘experts’ in inverted commas because I deeply mistrust ‘duel by experts’ as a debating tool. I don’t think any of the pathologists mentioned above took the shroud at anything other than face value. As a photograph, the eye area does indeed appear to bulge more than normal optical anatomy allows, so it was reasonable for them to conclude that there was something else present. Being ‘experts,’ of course, they were much too canny to make any historical suggestion as to what it might be.I think Yannick’s analysis is very reasonable here. I note that Don Lynn was ‘a true imagery expert’ and also ‘totally biased and misleading.’ without ‘a trained eye and brain.’ What is the unbiased bystander to make of that?

This did not prevent them being wiped or mopped up, as long as the cloth bearing the ‘lifeblood’ remained with the body. I have seen footage of devout Jews mopping up the blood of suicide bomb victims so that it can be buried with the victim. As Jesus did not die of blood loss, and as the trickles down the arms and face and the mass of blood which may have covered the back were relatively minor spills, there is no reason why they shouldn’t have been washed thoroughly and away. Subsequent major oozes, such as from the wrist and spear wounds could have been left in place or wiped off, with the cleaning cloth remaining with the body. If the body was being cleaned, apparently while sitting upright, and fresh blood flowed, then wiping it off seems a nice thing to do.

He is far from the first to observe that the scourge marks do not appear to tear any skin, are distinct from each other, and, if taken in twos or threes, appear to be neatly splayed rather than coming together in an irregular clump. Furthermore, although the eminent pathologists, and others, seem in agreement, in fact of course they don’t. There are two common reconstructions of the instrument which could have conflicted the ‘dumb bell’ wounds, both different, and both archaeologically unfounded. In order to explain the variety, some authors have listed a regular arsenal of possible devices, all of which seem to have left clearly distinguishable marks on the body. Then, of course, we have the ‘was the body washed?’ question, about which the eminent pathologists are in confusion. Dave Hines’ big post is misleading in several respects. There is no jury, and there has been no ruling. Had there been a ‘trial’ of the kind so many people think there is, the eminent pathologists would certainly not have been accepted at their word. They would have been extensively cross examined. All of them would immediately have explained that examining a sheet with an image on it was not at all their area of expertise, and that they were doing the best they could with the data available. Dr Zugibe, as eminent as they come, was frankly contemptuous of Dr Barbet, as eminent as they come, claiming that his knowledge of basic anatomy was mistaken, and daveb in particular, I’ve no doubt, would have liked to cross examine Dr Zugibe to try to reconcile the two Expressions like “there is no doubt” and “the numbers don’t lie” may be reassuring to the convinced; they are no argument for authenticity.

If the body, with side wound reopened and dripping with lots of blood, was laid gently, being held by a couple of people maybe under the arms and knees, on a flat sheet, would two neat little rivulets of blood trickle across the sheet from one side to the other, and then immediately dry so as not to get smudged? Or would the twin trickles flow from the chest wound across the back of the body itself, not dripping onto the sheet at all, and then dry so perfectly that they didn’t smudge at all when it was laid on the sheet? Or did the trickles of blood cleverly make their way across the body along the top of the arch of the back (warped by rigor mortis), in defiance of gravity, so that by not touching the cloth they didn’t get smudged? In which case how did they arrive on the cloth? So: Matthias. Well done for at least trying to envisage what might have occurred, but your experiment appears to have demonstrated the likelihood of something that is not represented on the shroud.

Some good scientists, it is true, have carried out observations that suggest to them that there is no image under the bloodstains, and others have carried out observations that suggest the opposite. That’s fine; that’s what real science is. “No one who analyzed the Shroud up, close and personal has ever found coloration under a blood or a serum stain.” This statement is absurd. Only Adler carried out any such study, and this is what he said: “Interestingly, fibrils freed of their coatings using this technique [protease to dissolve away any protein] closely resemble the non image fibrils of the Shroud.” I cannot take this as a general truth.

Neither its colour nor its pattern nor its chemical makeup have been satisfactorily explained, and such experiments which have been carried out have not supported authenticity well. In short, as I said before, the evidence of the bloodstains is not definitive, and I can be very sure that Yannick’s confidence in ‘proven facts’ would certainly not be backed up by any of the scientists he lists.

If the Resurrection is explicable in scientific terms, then both it, and the image on the Shroud, and any relationship between the two, can be explored scientifically. If, however, the Resurrection is defined as an event outside of science, then obviously it is not accessible by scientific inquiry, and if the Shroud image is related to the Resurrection, neither is its formation. That being so, it is reasonable for a scientist, simply for the sake of the validity of his exploration, to adopt the first alternative. Such then, is the default position for almost all the scientists to have worked on the Shroud, even di Lazzaro and Giulio Fanti, who hope that some scientific source for their radiation/discharge hypotheses may eventually be found, and John Jackson, who seems vaguely to hope for some ‘new physics’ to come to the rescue of his collapse hypothesis. “Assume arguendo that the resurrection event was a transfer of the body into another dimension or universe. It would probably make sense than that the body traveled both up and down simultaneously AS WE WOULD PERCEIVE IT.” Now that’s not science at all. Why should anyone assume that Resurrection involves a transfer of the body into another dimension? But if one did, why would it “probably make sense than that the body travelled both up and down simultaneously”, even “as we would perceive it.”? It’s not impossible, but it’s not science, and as such, it doesn’t have to make sense. There is no need to pretend that it might. If I were compelled to say what a Resurrection miracle might ‘probably’ be, I would look towards those other examples of people raised from the dead by Jesus, namely Lazarus, Jairus’ daughter and the son of the widow of Nain. No suggestion of transferring bodies into other dimensions there, upwards or downwards.

However, various people have suggested various intermediate substances, both natural and artificial, as a result of the suffering and funeral of Christ or as a medieval process, in order to achieve this deterioration. In an article Pellicori wrote for Archaeology magazine with Mark Evans, he said: “The hypothesis that these changes [to the cellulose] were catalysed by natural skin secretions or preservative burial ointments is in no way diminished by the absence of these substances today – they could easily have evaporated or even been washed away over the centuries.” Some scientists feel that it is unlikely that every single trace of any intermediate substance could have vanished completely, be it pigment or spice or whatever, so that either some trace does in fact remain, such as Mc Crone’s red ochre or Rogers’s starch coating, or that its total absence means it was never there..","date":"2015-08-12","mins":"1:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/06/comparing-colin-berrys-methods-to-those-of-sam-pellicori/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comparing Colin Berry’s Methods to Those of Sam Pellicori"},{"id":"comment-201650","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The evidence of the bloodstains is by no means as definitive as Yannick thinks, and cannot be said to prove anything..","date":"2015-06-11","mins":"4:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/11/comment-promoted-charles-freeman-comes-closest/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted:  Charles Freeman Comes Closest"},{"id":"comment-1820","author":"hugh_farey","post":"And another thing… It is fascinating to compare Enrie’s photo with Durante’s.

One way of achieving this is for the crease to be lit from the side, when, if it is a valley, the side closest to the light source will be in shadow, and the side facing the light source, being more perpendicular to it, will be brighter than the background. If the crease is a ridge, the shading is reversed. This would occur in completely uncoloured cloth, and I believe most of the type 2 TIDS are of this kind. Intriguingly, the Shroud Scope “Durante 2002 Horizontal” image has the beard to the left of the eyes, while the “Face only” close up has it to the left. Because we seem to be attuned to think of light as generally coming from the top left, the long crease running from the forehead, very close to the epsilon mark, through an eye and on down the length of the cloth, appears to be a ridge in the “Face only” version, but a valley in the bigger version. I wonder which it is. Other creases are possible. Sigmoid, or recumbent creases, are typified by a single large shadow if the ‘lip’ is facing away from the light source, or simply a bright leading edge if it is facing towards it. As I say, these shadow details are observable in otherwise completely unmarked cloth. However, I have some difficulty with them in the shroud. If the shadow was a result of light coming from above or below the camera, as it travelled the length of the shroud, then transverse creases should be almost impossible to see, which is not the case. If from the right or left, then longitudinal creases should be invisible – also not the case. And if from any of the other four points of the compass, then the herringbone weave of the shroud should be much better defined in the strips lying across the rays of light than in those lying parallel to it. Also not the case. All this being true, one is inclined to think that the visible colouration of TIDS may not be due to the light and shadow at all; in which case they would be visible even if the shroud were ironed completely flat. Many of the TIDS, especially the type 1s, seem to be of this type. They seem to have twin verges darker than the background, and pale middles, which seem to me to be about the same colour as the background. I’m inclined to postulate that these are sigmoid or recumbent folds, over which the image was made, leaving the hidden interior pale. Some of them have very sharply defined edges, which suggests some pressure, closing the fold quite tightly together, and others less so (such as the big one across the beard) where the image mechanism appears to have coloured the interior as well. Just as a test, I would expect one side of such a crease, which consists of two layers of cloth, to be darker than the other. The most interesting one is right through the middle of a bit of the foot bloodstain (dorsal image), which is wholly uncoloured, suggesting the the fold was firmly closed when the blood made contact with the cloth. Shroud Scope has a measuring device, which is not terribly accurate, varying according to the magnification of the image, but indicates that the widest of the ‘white valleys’ is less than 2mm, which means that the folds are less than 1mm apart, approximately equal to the thickness of the cloth, I guess. Fortuitously (you might have guessed) I have recently spent some time rolling up and unrolling 5 metre lengths of cloth, which were acting as scenery for a travelling theatre, and these kinds of creases, both transverse and longitudinal, are very easy to ‘iron in’ as it were, and quite difficult to get out again later. Any mention of the shroud before the 1532 fire generally assumes it to be folded rather than rolled, from Ian Wilson’s Mandylion Face, to the Lirey poker holes, to the marks from the 1532 fire, so I am guessing that these creases are from the original manufacture of the cloth, be it 1st or 13th century, although some of them could easily have been ironed in further by one or other pressing mechanism, such as a hot bas relief..","date":"2013-02-03","mins":"7:43 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/could-this-be-clinching-evidence-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-contact-scorch/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Could this be clinching evidence that the Shroud image is a contact scorch?"},{"id":"comment-33560","author":"hugh_farey","post":"It may be, I think we can all agree, that Dan is deluding himself into denying the presence of coins over the eyes of the shroud image.

Your unsubstantiated opinion is not justified or explained. My opinion is explained in detail. The Catholic church has nothing to lose in determining whether the Shroud is authentic or not. Nor do individual Christians, unless their religion is determined more by a sheet of cloth than by the words and works of the founder of Christianity. Those who are convinced they know whether the Shroud is authentic or not will be delighted to be able to demonstrate that they were right all along, and those who are not convinced will be delighted that the truth has been discovered at last. I have no doubt that the Pontifical Academy of Sciences would agree. Their reluctance to permit further investigation is not because they don’t want to know, but because of the difficulty of finding appropriate personnel to carry it out, to ensure that there was as little inherent bias as possible, which could either influence the results, or, even if the results were scrupulously scientific, be thought of as having influenced the results. Louis suggests that ecumenical conferences are not possible in certain countries, presumably where religious views of tolerance, generosity, compassion and magnanimity are less well developed as in the UK. He may be correct; I don’t see that it has any relevance. I do not believe this statement: “There was no “ecumenism” there because what was trampled upon was Christian belief and a relic that is considered to be a Christian relic. I do not stand alone in my judgement, I am the only one who is speaking openly.” Christian belief was not trampled upon. It was disagreed with, but in the most friendly and generous manner. Ecumenism (or, to give it a less specifically Christian focus, “religious pluralism”) is not an attempt to make people of different beliefs merge into a single tradition, but an attempt to show that it is possible to hold very different beliefs but still live in harmony. A Jew, a Hindu, and at least three different denominations of Christianity met in a tent with Ahmadiyya Moslems in just such a spirit at the Jalsa Salana, and there is no doubt whatever that God smiled on the occasion..","date":"2015-09-19","mins":"8:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"id":"comment-210751","author":"hugh_farey","post":"“He knows very well [….]” Fortunately for us all, not a shred of what follows is true..","date":"2015-09-19","mins":"7:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"id":"comment-208101","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Only to say that different people have different views.

What follows is not at all definitive, but might show in which direction I am currently pointing. Imagine three artists producing an image of Christ. Artist A simply paints a picture. Even though it is life sized, he does not pretend that it is anything more than a painting. He probably does not paint a nude image, but, as nudity is what he wants to represent, a loose wisp of cloth is unrealistically ‘flown’ across the appropriate place. Artist B want to produce a “miracle.” He too just paints a picture, and it looks just like Artist A’s picture, but he manages to persuade some gullible clerics that it was found in a Byzantine church, which is enough to begin to establish its credentials. A hundred years later its frame is so covered in ribbon and episcopal seals that its miraculous nature is assured. Artist C wants to produce something which is not a painting, nor a miracle, but a representation of what might have been left on a cloth if it had covered a dead body. Whether he does this pretending that it is the real thing, or a representation of what the real thing might have looked like for liturgical or educational purposes is not important. Possibly he deliberately wants to encapsulate the entire passion, from the bloody sweat to the final spear thrust, and including the “stripping of his garments” all in a single educational package which can be displayed above an altar. Does he get a friend, paste him up and spread a cloth? Maybe he does, and the resulting mess is wholly inadequate. By experimentation, using a variety of materials and techniques, possibly including flour, oil, myrrh, aloes – even real sweat – he achieves a satisfactory result. You don’t believe it? Why indeed?

I’m not sure who “these researchers” are, but if they include me then I can assure you that they do not ignore facts, basic or not. However they may not feel that conclusions are as secure as others think they are, and will be happy to explain why. Firstly, any kind of contact mechanism, including but nor restricted to Colin’s flour coatings, could have the blood applied to the contacting material after the image making medium had been applied, so that when the cloth was pressed to the ‘body’ naturally the blood will contact the cloth before the medium, quite possibly obscuring its effects. Secondly the observations upon which the conclusion that there is no image under the blood are not particularly conclusive. The observations are that when a variety of fibrils are tested with protease, not only is all protein effectively removed, but that “blood” and “non image” fibres resemble each each other, but appear different from “image” fibres. The difference between “image” and “non image” fibres is that the surfaces of the former appear “corroded” while the latter appear “slightly corroded.” This corrosion, according to Heller and Adler, is directly related to cellulosic decomposition related to image formation. It should be noted that the observation that the colour of the cloth in image, non image, and scorch fibres is directly related to the degradation of the linen fibrils is directly contradictory to Ray Rogers’s hypothesis that the Shroud was covered with some kind of coating, which, if it was removed, would leave undisturbed linen beneath. However, it must be remembered that while the blood stained every fibril of the area of cloth with which it made contact, the image stained only a very few fibres on the upper surfaces of the crowns of the threads. In other words the vast majority of the blood fibrils would have had no image underneath them, even if the image appeared on the cloth before the blood. Furthermore, it is apparent from Mark Evans’s micrographs that much of the blood has been abraded away, and that this abrasion has mostly been from the uppermost surfaces of the threads, removing both blood and any image that may have been beneath, and leaving on the surface only fibres originally beneath the image layer.

Allow your eyes to let the two images merge into one, and there you go. It’s a clever effect, and only slightly marred by being completely inhuman. The moustache seem to jut bizarrely forward, the eyes are too deeply sunk, and the neck appears to have been carved away to nothing. The whole of the right side (the image’s right, that is) of the face below the cheek bone seems hollow as the man turns his head to the left (his left), and the beard seems to be hanging in space in front of the rest of the face. For this reason, surprisingly, I believe the ‘model’ upon which the familiar picture has been superimposed, has not been fiddled about with to make it more acceptable. However, I do understand that a ‘model’ has to be made. Simply taking the photo by itself results in all sorts of bizarre ridges and furrows created by the weave. These have to be smoothed out, to give a rather dull uniform grey computer ‘model’ (with extremely odd proportions) which can be artificially lit from various directions. The photo is then retrofitted back onto the model. That is why a relatively uniform surface , such as the cheeks, can be covered in such a wide range of greys, which if they really represent distance should cover it in pimples and pocks. The good old VP8 image analyzer photo shows what happens if you take the image ‘as is.’ (Incidentally, what happened to that machine? Was it ever used for anything else?). The analyzer used an absolute scale of brightness (as, perhaps, did Soons), which had the effect of envisioning the shroud as completely horizontal above the ‘body’ which created the image, whereas later versions have assumed that the shroud was draped. This means that the grey scale has to be ‘interpreted,’ as areas which could have different contours on the body would show up with the same brightness on the shroud, and vice versa. Most of the interpretations I have seen of this are highly subjective, and my own view is that the ‘horizontal’ interpretation produces better 3 D results. Perhaps also surprisingly to anybody who hasn’t tried it, but this effect is not peculiar to the shroud, nor does it prove that the shroud is not a painting or drawing. (Other things may prove that, but the 3 D effect does not.) You need a picture of a person with ‘face on’ lighting against a black background. Photoshop and similar programs have a ‘bas relief’ filter and an ’emboss’ filter, which emulate the VP8 in slightly different ways. With a little parameter adjustment it is possible to get images at least as accurate as the shroud, and sometimes a good deal more so..","date":"2012-11-18","mins":"3:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/18/i-certainly-have-real-reservations-about-petrus-soons-3d-work-any-comments-now/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I certainly have real reservations about Petrus Soons’ 3D work.

The child is partially obscured by the teddy he is carrying – we know that the teddy is in front of the child. And so on. Our familiarity with faces is such that any picture of a face, however crude, implies that the nose protrudes and the eyes are deeper set, and we tend to see that simply as a matter of cultural experience. This has to be extracted from the claim that the 3 D information on the shroud is a result of a relationship between the darkness of the image and the vertical distance between a hypothetical body and a hypothetical sheet, which in the VP 8 and Image J is horizontal. Extracting the cultural bias is, however, extraordinarily difficult, and has led people looking at the VP 8 graphics as if they were a great deal more realistic than they actually are. A man’s cheeks and eyebrows are not in the same plane as his nose, (as appears in the Shroud and in the image above), but we unconsciously forgive the images that show them to be so because we know what they ‘ought’ to look like.

After death, when there is no further renewal of the energy supply and when the integrity of cell membranes is lost, cell walls become freely permeable to potassium ions, and the concentration inside and outside cells tends to equilibrate. In consequence, serum potassium concentration rises from about 3.5 mmol l−1 prior to death to 18 mmol l−1 at 1 h, and 25 mmol l−1 at 24 h after death. Concentrations above approximately 8 mmol l−1 in life are commonly fatal, but clearly the existence of lethal concentrations before death cannot be inferred from finding them post mortem.” It appears that if the blood stains are indeed an exudate, there should be about 7 times as much potassium in them as is found in normal blood, not the vanishingly low amount actually found.

Superficially they’re excellent, but, as I have said, once one begins to probe the details, one is left with more and more difficulties that militate against authenticity (although heaven knows, they don’t necessarily support the forgery hypothesis either). For instance, the ranks of even the most determined authenticitists are split between the “washed” and the “unwashed” (referring to the body, of course, not the people!). Setting aside those who think the shroud is a forgery, or who don’t think the blood is blood at all, I believe that few people doubt that the scourging would have left the body drenched with blood, and that the rivulets of blood down the arms, at least, were made while the body hung on the cross. In order to produce those neat little dumbbells, the body would have had to be washed – but then, why not wash off the rivulets down the arms or on the brows? Or the body was not washed, in which case how did those delicate little patterns extrude themselves through the matted blood over the back? Various semi scientists have tied themselves in knots attempting to account for this phenomenon, more or less unsuccessfully. They are clot retraction patterns, they are serum exudates, they are haemolytic derivatives and all sorts of odd variations, most of which can explain some aspects of the shroud bloodstains, but fail when applied to others. Here’s a simple experiment. Get a teat pipette of red liquid and attempt to replicate (or produce anything at all resembling) the blood belt, by some kind of natural flow. Most so called observers have assumed that the blood flowed from the sides and pooled in the middle, when this is clearly not the case. Matthias carried out some experiments on himself, dripping wine from a putative spear thrust while lying on the floor (https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a book review of joe nickells the science of miracles/), but he does not say how far it trickled under his back, or whether he repeated the experiment lying on his side.

I have been excoriated here once or twice for taking what seems a good coherent and rational experiment, and denying the unassailability of its conclusions by pointing out a contrary detail that negates them. The irritating 610nm spike on the reflectance spectrum of the blood, for instance, simply cannot be swept aside as irrelevant, however compelling the vast majority of blood identification tests have been. Something similar is true of the scorch hypothesis. In spite of OK’s protestations that Colin’s images are not identical to the shroud, a simple scorch demonstrates almost all the characteristics required of the shroud image. It’s 3 D quality and “negative” affect are extremely similar, and there is no pigmentation other than degraded flax fibres. The STURP team regularly described the image as resembling a scorch. Which it does. Nevertheless, there are two inconvenient details which contra indicate, and until they are resolved, the scorch hypothesis cannot be said to have been confirmed. Firstly, the shroud image does not penetrate the cloth. If I want to achieve this, I have to brush a very hot spatula very quickly over the surface of cloth. I have not managed to achieve it using a bas relief. Some interesting experiments have been carried out using different materials (china and brass), different substrates (cloth, wood and snow) different temperatures and different contact times, but every time, if I can see the image on one side, I can also see it on the other. The other problem is UV fluorescence. The whole of the shroud fluoresces slightly, but the image appears dark. Although this is easy to achieve if the scorch is dark enough to be described as “brown” it appears that most photographs of the shroud are deceptive, and that the image is best described as “yellow”. If however, I produce a yellow scorch (usually by reducing the temperature of the bas relief), then I find it fluoresces brightly. As I hope anyone who has read this far will see, I am as willing to recognise discrepancies with non authenticity image formation claims as I am for pro authenticity claims..","date":"2013-11-15","mins":"9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.

As for the superficiality, I don’t think people realise how dense the Shroud is. It is almost twice the density of a bed sheet, for example. This in itself is enough to prevent much that happens on one side from penetrating to the other. Yes, all the ‘scorch’ variations explored so far are riddled with difficulties.

Collimated rays of light (or other wavelengths) hitting the cloth at an angle would necessarily cause ‘shadows,’ which would extend behind the hills in the opposite direction to the incident rays. Rays perpendicular to the cloth wouldn’t create shadows. If an appropriate analysis of, say, Mark Evans’s photos were made, increasing the contrast between ‘image’ and ‘background,’ it would indeed be possible to determine whether the rays hit the cloth orthogonally or not. Much of the discussion of this question comes from consideration of the lack of ‘sides’ to the image, and particularly the fact that there is no ‘Agamemnon mask’ appearance to the head, which must have occurred if the sheet were draped closely over the head. This has lead some people to suggest that whatever emanated from the body must have done so vertically, Others, suggesting that the sheet was roughly flat over the body, and held away from the sides either by bags of spices or by tension, are not in agreement whether the front of the face, in particular, shows distortion or not. It seems logical to assume that some parts of the body were actually in contact with the cloth, and others were not. Where there was contact, there would not, of course, be any directionality, and one might guess that all parts in contact with the body would be similarly marked. It is interesting that the images of the forehead, nose and cheeks are not, in fact, equally dark – one of the reasons the 3 D imagery is so successful. The mechanism for image forming nevertheless seems the same for both contact and non contact areas. Colin Berry thinks this is peculiar, and attributes all the image to contact, but at different pressure in different places, and he may be correct. In this case, the ‘Agamemnon mask’ effect is eliminated by using a bas relief rather than a full depth body. John Jackson recognises a similar problem, but achieves his affect by imagining the cloth sinking through different thicknesses of an image making aether before coming to rest on the stone surface of the tomb. If there is some non contact image formed by rays of some kind, I suggest that a photomicrograph of the side of the nose would be a good place to look for ‘shadows.’.","date":"2013-04-21","mins":"6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/john-klotz-new-quantum-christ-blog/","cat":"image_theory","title":"John Klotz’ new Quantum Christ Blog"},{"id":"comment-31523","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I’m sorry if I unintentionally implied sacrilege, but all the intricate physical details which cannot be explained by forgery are no less intricate, nor excused from detailed explanation, by a resurrection hypothesis.

By subtracting the ‘height above datum’ of the head from the ‘height above datum’ of the cloth, you are left with a vertical interval.

Nabber’s shrouds at Khirbet Qazone are of course Nabataean rather than Jewish, with quite a different funerary tradition. The vast majority of Jewish burials were reduced to ossuaries after a year or so, which is why there has been little opportunity to discover any Shrouds used in the interim stage. There does seem to have a trend towards over elaborate burial clothes, which Rabbi Gamaliel reversed by example rather than dictat, but apart from that there is very little evidence of what a conventional burial should have consisted of, and how far, and how often, the prescription was deviated from, either by custom circumstance.

A newsletter from 1983 dealing with drug abuse and listing every possible publication that might be relevant mentions the Journal of Altered States of Consciousness, which after all covers what drugs do, saying that the journal deals in “psycho pharmacology, dream research, yoga, parapsychology and such states as trance, hypnosis, general anesthesia, and mystic rapture.” This hardly constitutes WHO recognition of parapsychology, does it? The Journal changed its name in 1981 to ‘Imagination, Cognition and Personality’, whose current website does not mention anything parapsychological among its ‘Aims and Scope.’ Information from good ol’ Wiki…. Although the the Parapsychological Association is affiliated to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the US National Academy of Sciences has said that: “no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena” has been found, and most parapyschological departments of universities are dedicated not to assuming it exists, but to trying to find some evidence for it. So far they have been unsuccessful. A panel commissioned by the United States National Research Council to study paranormal claims concluded that “despite a 130 year record of scientiﬁc research on such matters, our committee could ﬁnd no scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for the existence of phenomena such as extrasensory perception, mental telepathy or ‘mind over matter’ exercises… Evaluation of a large body of the best available evidence simply does not support the contention that these phenomena exist.” Well, they may all be wrong, and as we have heard elsewhere in this post, some ideas have eventually become accepted even after years of rejection, but it would clearly be wrong to suggest that parapsychology is in anyway mainstream science just yet..","date":"2015-11-16","mins":"4:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/13/nevertheless-the-images-are-real-enough/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nevertheless, the images are real enough!"},{"id":"comment-42054","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Excellent.

I couldn’t be any more institutionally Christian without becoming a monk! (I could no doubt be a much nicer person, but that’s another facet altogether). However, one of the Catholic version of Christianity’s core beliefs in is the rationality of the Universe, and the conviction that Faith and Reason cannot conflict. This was first expressed explicitly by St Augustine of Hippo, reiterated by Thomas Aquinas confirmed most recently by John Paul II and Benedict XV, and is the rationale behind the Pontifical Academy of Science. (Is there another religion in the world with a scientific institution so close to its heart?) The nature of the resurrection may, perhaps, be inexplicable. To deny that anything happened at all, which is the usual atheist line, is absurd, but all attempts to pin down exactly what it was have proved fruitless, and theology has moved on. The science of the physical resurrection, in other words, has stopped. Inexplicable – leave it and move on. That’s exactly why, as I explained above, I won’t be treating the shroud as inexplicable. Several of the commenters on this blog (including yourself, it seems) would like to have it both ways, and try to intertwine the rational and the irrational, the scientific and the mystic. They would like Jesus to have exploded in a burst of radiation, or dematerialised in an instant vacuum, or even simply ceased decomposing, woke up and yawned; and they would like this to have happened ‘miraculously,’ but without disturbing the laws of physics. This may be permissible within the bounds of individual conscience, but it is not Catholic orthodoxy or teaching. By now, I can feel some of you stuttering with rage and thinking that I have demoted the shroud to the relevance of one of Napoleon’s handkerchiefs. Nothing could be further than the truth. Although St Augustine said that Faith and Reason could never conflict, he famously said that Faith ‘precedes’ Reason. He didn’t altogether mean that if there was uncertainty about a question then Faith should be given the benefit of the doubt, but more that unless you believe something is worth the bother, there would be no point in trying to find out more about it in the first place. The shroud will continue to be important even if it is no more miraculous than any of the great masters’ paintings and sculptures of the life of Christ. It can be an object of personal contemplation, a means of education, a focus of unity among those drawn to its image. It inspires awe, immanence and compassion.

The first is the variation in pressure where the two surfaces (‘body’ and cloth) are in contact, and the second a much more diffuse convection effect where they are not. Dr Power quotes John Jackson’s list of intensity/distance correlations which, when graphed, clearly show a steep line over the first centimetre or two (which I would interpret as the ‘contact’ zone) and a much more flatter line between that distance and four or five centimetres (the ‘convection’ zone). In other words a very small difference in contact pressure would produce a large intensity variation, while quite a large difference in distance in non contact zones has little effect on image intensity. The radiation hypothesis has to cope with a number of difficulties; the fact that it has to be vertically collimated, and the severe distance/intensity attenuation being the biggest. Also the fact that even between points of the same distance, at least as determined by Jackson, the intensity varies by a factor of two.

I would predict that each warp thread was made of its own hank, and therefore that vertical bands of different intensity would occur randomly across the image, giving irregular widths of lighter and darker areas. Each weft hank, on the other hand, would be woven across and back until it was used up, and a new hank attached to the shuttle. This would result in horizontal bands of approximately uniform width on the image. The intersection of these bands would produce a vaguely chequered effect, ranging from light (where two light bands intersect) through medium (one light, one dark), to dark (two dark bands), with endless graduations in between as the colour of each band varies anyway. This pattern should be seen all over the Shroud, even in non image areas. If the image is related to the treatment of the cloth, then indeed light image areas could be less responsive to whatever caused the image, producing a less intense image, and dark areas more so, producing a more intense image. This would vindicate Rogers’s suggestion. The exact reverse of this could in theory be also the case! I’m in Kathmandu just at present and do not have Image J with me, but it would be instructive to take a vertical strip or two, perhaps one centimetre wide, of non image, to see if it produced approximately evenly distributed variations in intensity (or height), and a horizontal image or two of non image to see if it produced random variations..","date":"2014-07-22","mins":"12:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

To help with the explanation, I will say that the shroud is woven of threads, and each thread is made of twisted fibres. These are loose and can be pulled apart with a needle. Each fibre, in turn, is made of fibrils, packed around a hollow centre, the lumen, and surrounded by a sheath. It seems reasonably clear from Mark Evans’s micrographs that the image appears only on the uppermost fibres of the threads of the shroud, not on the fibres buried within the threads, and not on the fibres as they dive beneath other threads as part of the weave. It is not clear from Evans’s photos whether these coloured areas are as a result of the whole fibre being discoloured, just the sheath, just the fibrils, or what. Explaining the mechanism of image formation, whether by heat (subdivided into conduction and radiation), chemically (by gas diffusion or possibly direct contact), or some other kind of electromagnetic or nuclear radiation, must intimately involve the chemistry of the fibres, and those who study it are not in universal agreement, to put it mildly. Any kind of gas diffusion and most kinds of radiation seem to penetrate too deeply and too widely, and even conduction or contact must be fantastically discriminate to produce such an effect. I have shown that brushing the surface of linen with a hot spatula can do it, but am not aware of any other method that simple. Most experimenters have first done something to weaken the correct fibres appropriately, and then produced the surface discolouration by heating in an oven. Fanti and his friends have found that very intense, very short bursts of laser light can do the trick, while Garlaschelli has done it by dabbing cloth with a gel containing sulphuric acid. Rogers despaired of achieving it in the end, and postulated that the linen wasn’t degraded at all, but that the image appears only on a surface coating derived from an evaporation gradient. Whatever the truth of the process, understanding the relative sensitivities of the chemicals which make up the linen fibres, be they cellulose (crystalline or amorphous), lignin (with or without vanillin), hemicellulose, pectin or anything else, ought to be a great help..","date":"2013-10-31","mins":"8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/28/of-those-big-meaning-words-superficial-half-tone-and-striated/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of those big-meaning words: Superficial, half-tone and striated"},{"id":"comment-49325","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I just meant those ones you get by putting “shroud” and “Mark Evans” on Google images.

Anonymous, I have read all the papers you cite, and believe I have covered their conclusions before on this blog, probably in response to a similar posting by yourself. I will limit myself to a two observations, and hope that others will understand that your entire comment is similarly flawed. Firstly: “An X Ray fluorescence investigation […] was carried out on the Shroud to complement the X radiographic study […]. The blood marks show an element distribution CONSISTENT WITH A BLOOD CLOT EXUDATE, including an iron value elevated over the cloth background value, but no evidence for the presence of mercury or any of the trace elements associated with the mineral forms of iron oxides.” The actual words of the report are: In the initial abstract – “In ‘blood’ stain regions the measurements show significantly higher concentrations of iron. However the data do not allow a unique identification of the stain’s origins.” In the Conclusion – “Substantially non uniform concentrations of iron were observed, particularly at the dorsal foot and side wound ‘blood’ stain regions. However we can say no more than that either blood or some iron based pigment was used to produce the stains.” Oh, and the word ‘mercury’ does not appear in the report at all. Secondly: “The reflectance spectra of the blood marks from the whole cloth and also a near UV visible microspectrophotometric study of blood particles from the sticky tapes […] are CONSISTENT WITH THE SPECTRA EXPECTED FOR A TRAUMATIC BLOOD CLOT EXUDATE.” Need I remark that in none of the papers cited do the words “trauma”, “exudate” or “clot” appear at all, let alone an image of the “spectra expected” from one. “In a more recent study […], transmission UV visible spectra of a simulacrum of a TRAUMATIC CLOT EXUDATE prepared from laboratory chemicals MATCHES THESE OBSERVED SHROUD SPECTRA, but the simulacrum of a mineral pigment “blood” composed of iron oxide, mercuric sulfide and gelatin IS A COMPLETE MISMATCH.” The spectra from which this nonsense is derived can be seen at http://www.sindone.info/ADLER.PDF.

How we’ve grown up since then! To more significant matters. Everything hinges on two questions: Did the man in the shroud have his legs bent?” and “Was the shroud over the top of the body horizontal or draped?” Without clear answers to both these questions, all the measurements and superimpositions are more or less meaningless. There are other related questions, but these are the important ones. Question 1. The dorsal image shows clear impressions of the calves and thighs. As the simplest experiment will demonstrate, the slightest bending of the knees lifts the calves well clear of the floor. Prima facie, the man did not have his legs bent. Other possibilities – even under the body, the shroud followed its contours, perhaps by being laid on some sort of mattress, or, the image of the calves is not a contact image, but a collimated projection of both image and bloodstains downwards from the body. Question 2. If the shroud on the top of the body followed its contours, while the shroud on the floor remained flat, the top image would be longer than the bottom image. The more bent the knees, the more pronounced would be the discrepancy. Although there is room for manoeuvre here, if the two images are superimposed crown of head to crown of head, the rest of the features match up very well without any adjustment of the upper image length. Prima facie, the two images are the same length. Other possibilities – the two images also match up reasonably well if the lower image is stretched by 10cm or so, so it’s all a bit subjective.

The paper describes how such a reaction could theoretically come about; the amino reactants may derive from a corpse, and the surface of the shroud could have been prepared using chemicals which rendered only the surface fibres susceptible. Experiments using ammonia as the gas and dextrin (very similar to gum arabic, as it happens) as the sugar showed that a Maillard reaction between these two components does, in fact occur.

There was no attempt to carry out the experiments using a big piece of cloth, a more realistic starch & saponaria preparation, or any chemicals actually associated with dead body.

In this respect, the work of Ray Rogers demonstrates that the work of, among others, Giulio Fanti, is a waste of time, as they have been working on the linen itself. However, in spite of his extensive quoting, he does not notice the profound contradictions between, specifically, Heller & Adler and Rogers. Neither scientist identified Saponaria on the cloth, for example. Heller & Adler specifically tested for it and found no evidence for it, while Rogers’s only evidence at all was that it might be responsible for the weak background UV fluorescence observed by Miller and Pellicori. Nevertheless Rogers’s subsequent work was entirely predicated on the presence of Saponaria. Rogers also finds, and mentions several times, the presence of starch on the cloth, which Heller & Adler did not find at all, although they did test for it. Most curiously, Rogers says that in March 1981, when STURP met to discuss their findings, and Adler revealed that the image could be reduce by diimide, that these observations “strongly suggested that the cellulose was not involved in image formation.” However, in their subsequent paper published four months later, Heller & Adler write: “the image was produced by some dehydrative oxidative process of the cellulose structure of the linen.” Now without any prejudice for or against any of these scientists, their observations or their peer reviewed or other publications, it must be seen that no definite conclusion can be made, so far, as to which of the competing hypotheses regarding the image producing substrate is correct.

Depending on its wavelength, intensity and duration, deterioration of linen is certainly possible, and in some circumstances, as di Lazzaro has shown, results very similar to the discolouration of the Shroud can be achieved. The first question is then, where did the ‘light’ come from? The problem here is that except in very peculiar circumstances which I shall describe below, it could not have come from the object making the image (such as the body of Christ). If you expose a piece of photographic paper to a lamp in a dark room, you do not get a photo of the lamp, just a white blur, as rays from all over the lamp spread out and affect all over the paper. Even if you place a luminous mask on a piece of photographic paper in the dark, you do not get a photo of the mask, although a vague outline of its shape might be possible. This is because the light from all over the mask radiates in all directions. The peculiar circumstances mentioned above would be that if the rays of light from every point on the object all emerged and travelled in exactly the same direction, and if the intensity of the ray from each point diminished according to its distance from the cloth, then indeed, you might get a photo of a lamp or a luminous mask just be exposing it to a photosensitive sheet. There is no known way to achieve this, although Giulio Fanti’s coronal discharge experiments have been exploring the idea.

Remarkably, the shroud image shows exactly the same. 3) “The image of the black lady shows graphically what a mess that 3 D enhancement can make of a black and white photograph when all it can read is tonal contrast, enhancing regions that reflected most light over those that did not. See how she has acquired a grotesque kind of necklace simply through taut sinews in the neck being enhanced!” The sinews of her neck do indeed resemble a kind of necklace, being prominent parts of the photo. But they are also prominent parts of her anatomy. They may not be as grotesque as this on real life, but the sinews of a nect really do stand out from the body.

It is also not established whether an image could remain even if all the pigment was washed or flaked away.

It takes the form of a conversation, alternating between Joseph A. Kohlbeck, optical crystallographer, and Eugenia L. Nitowski, archaeologist, both with impeccable credentials. First. What, precisely, did Kohlbeck examine? In his own words: “Ray Rogers, asked me to take some quality photomicrographs and to microscopically examine some shroud fibers.” ” I began to focus on particles of calcium carbonate on the fiber samples.” “We then examined a calcium sample from the shroud taken from the area known as the “bloody foot” because this showed a larger concentration of calcium carbonate than other areas.” (Footnote: “Mylar tape sample JAB” – I think he means 1 AB, which was taken from the dribble of blood emanating sideways from the heel of the big footprint) This certainly sounds more than Villarreal’s speck. On the other hand there is no mention of the knee or nose. Second. What, precisely, did Kohlbeck find on the Shroud? In his own words: “This calcium carbonate turned out to be aragonite, not the more common calcite – and exhibited small amounts of strontium and iron.” (Footnote – “Little could be done to examine the few small particles microscopically in the environment of the Mylar tape used to lift the sample because the tape had crystalline properties which interfered with obtaining optical information from the particles. Thus the risk was taken to recover these few crystals and remount them in a 1.680n D Cargille immersion oil. The intermediate or b [beta] index of aragonite is 1.680, and a match at specific orientations would be a good indication of the possibility of aragonite. In one orientation there was a match for the 1.680 index oil. An interference figure at 1250× having a small 2 V angle estimated 18–20 optically negative was observed. These optical properties would be expected from aragonite and this is a strong suggestion that these fragments, particularly when compared with the Jerusalem samples, are aragonite.”) Meanwhile Nitowski was collecting samples from Jerusalem to be analysed as well. There is no mention of the number or whereabouts of the samples collected, except that they were “from inside tombs in the general vicinity of Jerusalem”. Kohlbeck says: “This particular limestone was primarily travertine aragonite deposited from springs, rather than the more common calcite.” “In addition to the aragonite, our Jerusalem samples also contained small quantities of iron and strontium but no lead.” A footnote says that the S Tu RP team did detect lead in the Shroud, but that Levi Setti did not. They conclude this part of their article: “Of course, this doesn’t prove that the aragonite on the shroud came from Jerusalem, but this could be a reasonable explanation. Nevertheless, aragonite with these traces can no doubt be found elsewhere in the world as well as in Jerusalem.” A footnote hopes that further investigation will identify rare trace elements on both samples that will clearly distinguish them from aragonite samples elsewhere in the world. Then they go on to discuss blood specks also found on the fibres. I also have a copy of UV Visible Reflectance and Fluorescence Spectra of the Shroud of Turin, by Roger and Marion Gilbert, and for good measure, Spectral Properties of the Shroud of Turin, by S.F.

Your description of a 10ppm iron oxide/water mixture not being visible when painted on linen is a definite counter example to Walter Sandford’s experiments. Unless he or Mc Crone was an out and out liar, which I do not believe, I think he must have painted over and over his image until finally the areal density was sufficient to be visible. The question now arises of what the minimum areal density of iron oxide for visibility is, and whether an image of such a density is visible by transmitted light. I feel another exeriment coming on, which has the advantage of being sufficiently simple for me not to have to do it myself, but to delegate it to a willing volunteer!

I couldn’t agree more. Hypothesis One: The Shroud image could have been produced by the application of pigment, binder and medium, which at the time of application was visible as an image by virtue of the pigment, but which may now only be visible by virtue of the degradation of the substrate. This can be tested by various experiments involving different possible substances in different quantities upon different preparations of cloth. It cannot be refuted (definitely ruled out) except by demonstrating that it is impossible. Hypothesis Two. The Shroud image could have been produced by the decomposition of a human body within which it was wrapped, the products of which, chemical, electromagnetic, or nuclear reacted with the cloth in such a way that an image was formed. This can be tested by various experiments involving different possible emanations in different quantitiies upon different preparations of cloth. It cannot be refuted (definitely ruled out) except by demonstrating that it is impossible. In both these cases some emphasis should be placed on the word “possible.” A painting technique involving azo dyes could be considered impossible unless some evidence could be found to suggest that such compounds existed 500 years ago. A decomposition technique involving collimated radiation could be considered impossible unless some evidence could be found to suggest that such radiation can emerge from a body. Hypothesis Three. The Shroud image could have been produced by a miracle. This cannot be tested. It cannot be refuted. It is not a scientific hypothesis. The only thing I would add to Mario’s “It is very unlikely that it is a painting for all the reasons already mentioned,” is, as you will have guessed “It is very unlikely that it is a natural formation for all the reasons already mentioned.” The juxtaposition of these two statements weakens the term “very unlikely” somewhat..","date":"2014-09-25","mins":"2:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"id":"comment-155139","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I agree with all of that, Mario.

A hypothesis is not established by demonstrating its possibility; it is refuted by demonstrating its impossiblity. See Thibaut’s comment below, where he demonstrates that a 10ppm iron oxide/water mixture does not result in a visible image. That’s a real challenge to Mc Crone’s work. If your statement were correct, it would be equally true to say that unless at least one form of biological/physical formation were demonstrated it cannot be hypothesised that the Shroud formed naturally in a tomb. Which is of course untrue. However, it would not be sensible not to have some idea of how a painting might have come about. Another experiment currently underway but not yet completed involves a cloth bag containing a thick paste of iron oxide, water, egg white and sulphuric acid. This is dabbed vertically downwards onto a piece of linen. A very visible reddish disc of iron oxide is formed, denser in the middle than the outside, without edges or directionality, and which does not seep through to the other side of the cloth. The linen is left to dry, then washed thoroughly to try to remove everything. After redrying again, the idea is that we have nothing more than a sulphuric acid “scorch” to show where the “paint bag” was pressed to the linen. So far, results have been poor. My iron oxide is so fine it comes through the cloth bag too readily, and the thick paste tends to dry up too quickly. The acid does not produce a visible “chemical scorch” unless the linen is placed in an oven, and even then the results are rather erratic. However, there are clearly many permutations to be tried, and I have hopes that something respectably supportive of the painting hypothesis will emerge eventually!.","date":"2014-09-24","mins":"5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"id":"comment-157877","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The best overall coverage of the Shroud easily avaialble is Shroud 2.0, which is an app for i Pad, and not downloadable onto computers, but you can take screen shots and send them across..","date":"2014-09-30","mins":"2:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"id":"comment-156441","author":"hugh_farey","post":"There is no concentration of aragonite.

None of these is necessarily true. The density of the shroud is easily sufficient to prevent pigment soaking through, many watercolours are painting using ‘dabs’ of brush rather than any strokes, and an indication of light direction is not a necessary part of portrait painting, although frequently present.

Yes, Rogers was clear about a lot of things which are a lot less clear to others, and which he only partially substantiated.The ‘thin layer of impurities’ which only resides on the crowns of the fibres does provide a reasonable explanation of why vapours emanating from the body would only discolour the crowns of the fibres. However, Rogers’s attempt to achieve his ‘thin layer of impurities’ by means of an evaporation gradient has not been satisfactorily demonstrated, and the uniform source of adequate vapours from all parts of the body has neither been demonstrated nor satisfactorily explained. Rogers’s ‘thin layer of impurities’ contradicts the findings of other scientists, who didn’t observe starch, and who did observe corroded fibres. Rogers explanation that these only consisted of his ‘thin layer’ cracking off is naive. Rogers’s critique of coronal discharge consisted of carrying out his own experiments ad finding them unsatisfactory, which is fair enough. However, his experiments are not comparable to Giulio Fanti’s, and therefore his comparisons about colour and corrosion are not necessarily valid. I do note that he says: “Even a short exposure will erode the surface of flax fibers. No such changes can be observed on Shroud fibers.” In fact this was exactly what was observed by Heller and Adler. If a thin film of impurities is necessary, or a discolouration only of the crowns of the threads of the cloth, then some form of contact, whether by acidified paint, or wheat flour paste, or even a hot bas relief, is far more likely than evaporated dextrin.

Well, you asked for it. Of his first 8 similarities, some apply to any photograph, some are irrelevant to holography, and some are simply untrue. 1) The image on the Shroud is perhaps 20nm thick. The image of a hologram is captured in emulsion about 8000nm thick. 2) Almost any picture has ‘good resolution.’ 3) The 3 D quality of the Shroud is qualitatively different from the 3 D quality of a hologram, which does not record any information about distance by means of image intensity. 4) Very few pictures can be seen from the back side. 5) “Both have light coming from only 1 direction to form image.” If this statement means anything, it is untrue. It may be referring to the Shroud as a result of collimated radiation from a dead body, in which case the light rays would be parallel, but a a hologram relies on light coming from two directions in order to create an interference pattern, which is what a hologram is. One way of making a hologram is to have a single source, and the interference pattern is created by the reflection from the object coming back in the other direction. This requires a transparent film, which the Shroud is not. 6) “Both images fade and or vanish when tilted to the far right or far left.” The Shroud does no such thing. 7) Any monochrome picture is ‘single colour.’ 8) “Both images involve subject close to film plate to capture image (past 5cm there is no image formation on a reflection hologram) (I know because I tried it).” If the Shroud was created by light emanating from a body, then it would not be attenuated to zero over 5cm. If the Shroud image demonstrates such attenuation, then it is definitely not due to light. A hologram made using a single light source and transparent film works best if the object is very close to the film. However the Shroud is not transparent. A hologram made by a split beam and opaque film does not require the object to be as close as 5cm. The comment from You Tube is non sense. Dave is hopelessly confused as to how a hologram is made, and none of his statements is true.

You appear to have done this with a small figurine of Christ’s head. Needless to say, the Shroud does not resemble your hologram in any way. Cellulose acetate is not a photographic emulsion. It is what the base of the film is made of. The thickness of a thick human hair is about 160um, the thickness of the enamel on a hologram about 8um, the thickness of the image on the Shroud is about 0.002um. Myrhh and aloes have very few properties in common with cellulose acetate. You may be suggesting that they are photosensitive, like photographic emulsion, but unlike cellulose acetate, and for all I know you might be correct. Acetate fabric certainly can’t be used to make holograms unless it is photochemically treated. There are several sources online, mostly for making ‘sunprints’, but the easiest way is to buy photo emulsion and paint it on yourself. Alternatively you can make up your own, as I did myself some years ago, demonstrating that whatever the failings of Picknett and Prince, their assertion that the chemicals and technology necessary for photography were available in the 14th century was broadly correct, even if it does not seem to have been used at all at that time, let alone for making the Shroud.

There’s a surprise! I don’t think anybody here thinks that a medieval artist set out to create an image which could only be properly appreciated when intensity inverted like a negative. And the various photographic hypotheses have not gained general acceptance, probably because no one can believe that having invented or discovered the technique, it would not have been used on lots of other things, surely some of which would survive to this day. Arguments (above) against such ideas are largely unnecessary. Also, I don’t think anyone disputes that the Shroud is unique (with the possible exception of some other Shrouds – see below). However, the fact that there are no other comparable 13th century images can be contrasted with the fact that there are no other comparable 1st century images either. Uniqueness by itself is no proof of anything. Thomas de Wesselow and others have rightly pointed out that there was no need nor tradition for a “miraculous” relic to bear such a realistic imprint; a point neatly set aside by Charles’s suggestion that the Shroud was never intended either as a relic or as witness to a miracle. Carlos is incorrect to suppose that a congregation would be confused between the ‘negative’, monochrome, “realistic” image left on the Shroud as a witness to death, and the positive vision of the risen Christ himself. The whole point of the image being as it is was to emphasise its unmiraculous nature. It was designed to look like the contact image left by a body beginning to decay, not like a the residue of a supernatural resurrection. There must have been very little requirement for this kind of image. Making Christian shrouds may have been the only occasion when it was thought necessary. Even today it is extremely rare, and mostly more of an exercise than an artistic endeavour. Google ‘Brian Lai’ for a modern example. Nevertheless, that does not mean it was untried, or impossible. It is difficult to reconstruct the Shroud of Besançon from such images as remain, but it too appears to have had ‘negative’ characteristics, and its provenance precedes that of the shroud. (It is surely special pleading to say that the real Shroud of Besançon was in fact the Shroud of Turin, taken there after a fire, and that the next Shroud of Besançon was just a rough copy. Besançon and Lirey are only about 200km apart. I think someone would have noticed.) Nor is the image particularly clear. I don’t understand John Klotz’s statement above, about “the fineness of the detail of the image. Assuming arguendo a block print, or a painting, the image is too fine for any known method of reproduction.” The shroud image shows no eyelashes, eyebrows, nostrils, collarbones, nipples or navel, all of which could be perfectly clearly indicated on a fairly average block print. As for the experiment carried out by Jackson, as described by Thibault Heimburger above, perhaps we should be allowed to check its accuracy for ourselves. I am lucky enough to have videotaped, in 1982, a BBC programme of the QED series shown in 1983 called “Shroud of Jesus: Fact or Fake?” At one point the presenter, Anthony Clare, says: “Jackson called in the police to do another test. These artists are trained to compile pictures using shades of light and dark. Jackson got them to paint a Shroud like bust, but only in terms of shade equals height. There was a lot of cursing and swearing, but the result was quite interesting. What do you think? Almost as good as the Shroud? Not according to Jackson.” We see a couple of artists trying to sketch a face from two identical busts, placed at right angles to each other so that one is face on and one in profile. The “quite interesting” result (and only one of them) was not shown as it was drawn, but only as a negative. I have inverted it here so that we can see the original result, followed by the negative, and then the VP 8 image: Thibault, above, says: “The result? None of the pictures do show the 3 D characteristics of the shroud body image.” And Jackson, in the programme, says: “In my opinion the degree of comparison between those police artists’ attempts is not as good as what we see on the Shroud”. I disagree. I think the VP 8 transformation is at least as good as the Shroud’s, if not better. Further on in the programme the BBC commissioned its own replica shroud from Dr Brian Sagar of the Shirley Institute, specially woven for the programme and painted by Susan Hilton. Remarkably, although the making of the fabric was noted by the BSTS (search for Brian Sagar on the shroud.com website), the success or otherwise of the painting was ignored. That is a pity, because there was a concerted effort to duplicate all the characteristics of the the Shroud, in as simple a medieval way as possible. Brian Sagar: “Our problem was to find something that would reproduce this, leaving no traces, because we find no evidence of materials like protein or pigments of any kind, or metal ions, with the possible exception of some calcium, which was there in quite large quantities. We tried several materials that we know from past experience degrade cellulose in this way, and in the end we settled for alum, a material widely used by artists in medieval times.” Narrator: “Having settled on alum to degrade the cloth, Susan [Hilton, the artist] had to find a pigment, so she could see what she was painting. She chose brazil wood, often used with alum, and so popular in the middle ages that they even named a country after it. … For a canvas she used modern linen cloth that was specially woven to be like the real Shroud. That was sized with gum arabic, which contains calcium. … Finally a mixture of more gum arabic and alum was the medium to take the brazil wood pigment. The rest was up to Susan’s artistic skill. … And the finished product goes off for a bit of aging. [Cloth placed in an oven at 190°C for an unspecified time] We know that in the 15th century the Shroud was washed, in order, they believed, to test its authenticity. They probably used soda ash to get rid of those stubborn stains, like alum and brazil wood. [Cloth boiled in a large beaker] … Well, there’s the result. Looks good at a distance, and the closer you get, the less you see. [Close up] Tests showed that chemically everything was washed away except calcium and iron, and under the microscope the effect is strictly on the surface. It’s all very like the real Shroud. But the 3 D test still has to be passed. Viewed from this side [The side with the epsilon blood mark], the real Shroud looks a bit better than Susan’s painting, but turn the other cheek [Image rotated slowly through about 100°] and there’s very little difference. All in all it looks as though our fake is extraordinarily like the real thing.” So. No gesso, but a sizing of gum arabic. Would that show up in a protein test?.","date":"2015-01-16","mins":"1:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/15/there-is-another-reason-charles-freeman-is-wrong/","cat":"image_theory","title":"There is another reason Charles Freeman is wrong"},{"id":"comment-184049","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Here is a description of the programme described above.

Well yes and no. Fanti and Maggiolo did a lot of deconvolution of some photographs of the back side, and managed to derive a faint correspondence of the hair, moustache and nose, an even fainter correspondence of the hands area, and nothing resolvable from anywhere else. Given that the ‘normal’ image is entirely superficial, they assumed that the ‘back’ image was also entirely superficial, and consequently that the fibres between the two images did not carry the image through. They also show that the image on the back is not due to the frontal image “showing through,” as it might if it were much darker. They do not describe the back image as ‘smaller’; the correspondence of the bloodstains (which appear clearly) is accurate. They do describe it as having some slight differences from the front (specifically the nose appears more symetrical). The secondary image is in keeping with Rogers’s hypothesis. If an entire sheet is washed in a weak solution (and/or suspension) and allowed to dry, the solute appears concentrated on the outer fibres of the sheet, and minimally in the middle. The tightness of the weave may also prevent penetration to the middle anyway. I have not confirmed Rogers’s vaporograph ideas myself (cadaverine and putrescine seem remarkably difficult to get hold of…), but IF the image on the shroud is due to emanescing gases reacting only with the solute layer, and IF the gases penetrated the cloth, then I would expect an image on both sides but not in the middle, and considerably stronger and better defined on the contact side. The reaction of (e.g.) putrescine with starch is a Maillard reaction, so IF Rogers’s ideas are at all valid, then the discovery of the ‘back’ image certainly does not blow them away. I agree with Bippy that nearly all the naturalistic theories are flawed, and that, so far, none have produced wholly convincing explanations. However, even if they all ‘tumbled down’ I fear they are truly all science will ever have to offer. There is no scientific paradigm for the investigation of ‘unnatural theories,’ however true they may be. I don’t know where you got the idea that Science was the pursuit of truth. Only non Scientists think that! Science is the gradual refinement of models that describe or explain observed phenomena – methodologically natural if you like – and it does a pretty good job of it.

I have been a member of the British Shroud of Turin Society for donkey’s years, but began my present series of experiments as a result of renewed enthusiasm following the recent National Meeting of the BSTS. The two most active blogs seemed to be shroudstory (this one) and shroudofturinwithoutallthehype, so I began to read them, and start from there. I never take anybody’s word for granted if I can avoid it, so whenever possible I like to refer to original authors. I now have a copy of Pellicori and Miller’s paper on ultra violet fluorescence, for example, and also Fanti and Maggiolo’s discussion on the image on the ‘back’ of the shroud. Perhaps curiously, the former’s photos are not as good as the one in Rogers’s “Chemist’s Perspective” and the latter do not actually include a straight photo of the ‘back’ side, which I had to Google for. Anyway, equipped with a school laboratory (I should say I live and work at a residential school, with continued access to ‘my’ lab in the holidays) I set to work, starting with the long term axiom: “The image on the shroud cannot be a scorch because scorches fluoresce but the shroud image does not.” With a bas relief, a UV lamp and a sheet of linen, it was easy to discover that although fluorescence is an invariable associate of scorching, it appears as a surrounding ‘aura’ to a scorch, while the discoloured fibres themselves do not fluoresce. (unlike cotton, as I discovered much later, where the brown image itself glows brighter than the background under UV light). Further experiments showed that it was extremely difficult to prevent a scorch from travelling through the cloth and producing a clear image on the ‘back’ side, except by gently brushing the surface with a very hot spatula. However on obtaining some twill woven cotton (I couldn’t obtain twill linen), it is very noticeable that the ‘back’ image was then much weaker than the front, compared to the 1/1 weave linen I was using. Returning to UV, it then became apparent that although strictly speaking the visible image does not fluoresce, the whole image area fluoresces quite brightly, so that any extra fluorescence produced by scorching could be difficult to detect. Rather to my surprise,I find that this background fluorescence can be obtained from myrhh (which is fluorescent in its own right, or simply heating the cloth to a little over the boiling point of water (say 150 C or so). As to blood stains. Observations of photographs of threads are pretty inconclusive, I think. It appears that a solvent called diimide removes bloodstains to such an extent that the fibres beneath go white (i.e. No image). However it is not clear whether the same solvent applied to image fibres without blood, or indeed non image fibres which are ‘yellowed with age’ has the same result. It may be that diimide removes everything, including any image, in which case the idea that there is no image under the blood stains is distinctly not proven. You have noticed, I think, my capitalising of the word IF in my posting above. I have carried out a number of experiments with gravy browning, which in my bottle consists almost entirely of ‘ammonia caramel’ in water. The chemical is reasonably equivalent to the ‘impurity layer’ postulated for the shroud, with the advantage of being easily visible. Allowed to dry and teased apart, it is apparent that the colour appears principally on the outer surfaces of a cloth and, depending on how well it is soaked or rubbed in, rather less so within the thickness of a thread, or in places where two threads overlap. How much of this is due to evaporation concentration, and how much due to a failure to penetrate in the first place is difficult to say. Either way, Colin Berry’s latest post on shroudofturinwithoutallthehype reminds us that image formation had at least some effect on the structure of the fibres beneath it, which are described as altogether more fragile than non image fibres. I think I’ve gone on long enough for the general readers of this blog! If you want to contact me for more information my address is hughfarey (at) hotmail (dot) com.

After cooking a piece of linen for 20 minutes or so at 150 C, or after smearing it with myrhh oil (or both, I guess), it glows quite cheerfully under UV light. In the first case it appears a faint yellow brown under visible light (‘yellowed with age’), and in the second it has an oily translucency. Subsequent scorching at low temperatures (250 C say) actually decreases the overall fluorescence. This is because the brown scorch marks do not fluoresce, so the more there are of them, the less area of fluorescent cloth is left. I do not know if it it makes a difference whether the ‘overall’ fluorescence is applied before or after the ‘image’ fluorescence.

It’s not so much the source of energy – heat, light, nuclear radiation, acid, vapours, whatever – that we’re understanding, but what linen does when that energy arrives. I found Thibault’s paper very interesting and very worthwhile – and I wish I had a good microscope camera! It seems clear that there are at least two effects that have to be explained: the overall discolouration of whole threads, and the superficial darkening of the topmost fibres. There may also be an even more superficial coating which also has to be explained. Actually carrying out and observing the results of experiments brings a much better understanding of the problem than just reading about it. And it’s fun!.","date":"2012-10-23","mins":"3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"},{"id":"comment-18171","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I think that’ll be next on my to do list.

However, it also seems that the image is visible on the back side of the shroud Although I have not seen close ups of the fibres on the back of the shroud, this suggests that the discolouring mechanism, starting at the top surface, somehow flowed completely around the fibres, discolouring the back surface too, without actually affecting the fibres themselves.

I have a once trendy office toy, which consists of a horizontal mesh about 15cm square, pierced with thousands of vertical steel rods about 8cm long. At rest, the rods all hang at the same level, but when the grid is lowered over an object, the steel rods adjust to the height of the point they touch, and an exact representation of the object appears, modelled in steel, 8cm above the object. If I knew what it was called I’d reference a picture of it; they used to be very common. Anyway, I can’t believe there isn’t a digital computerised version of this, probably using a laser beam instead of steel rods. The height data thus aquired could be imaged as a 3 D representation, as on Image J, or the numbers could be converted into a grey scale, and a “shroud image” produced. I think you would get quite a good version, and not a “fuzzy, ghost like representation.” Next, I also take issue with: “There is no correlation in a photograph between the density of the imprint and the distance to the object.” In theory, of course this is true, and there are a number of clever artistic installations that bear this out. A series of flat black curtains at different distances from a camera ought to, and often do, produce the illusion of a single plane, and great surprise in an audience when a man walking between them seems just to appear and dissapear in and out of nowhere. However, in practice there often is some correlation between intensity and distance, and faces, especially, bear this out. Consider a white sphere, lit from directly in front. Does it appear in a photo as a disc? No. As the surface of the sphere slopes away from the frontal plane, the angle it makes with that plane reflects less and less light back to the camera, and in the photo the sphere is darker at the edges than it is in the middle. Much the same happens with faces – essentially pale spheres lit from directly in front. However, in detail, it would be truer to think of four or five such spheres squashed together, a big one for the forehead, a small one between two slightly larger ones for the nose and cheeks, and another for the chin. Each sphere appears equally bright where its surface is tangential to the plane in front of the face, which is why in the shroud, and in many photographs, the forehead, nose, cheeks and chin all appear more or less equally bright, and more or less equally high on an Image J repesentation. The more angled the surface of the ‘sphere’, the sides of the nose say, or the slopes of the eye sockets, the more different they are in intensity from the ‘flat’ frontal surfaces, and the greater the appearance of distance. In this way, by coincidence more than anything else, the distance/intensity colouration of the shroud image, which is probably real, resembles the distance/intensity colouration of a photograph. I’m not sure what the parameters of this observation are. Photos of people, as I have demonstrated on this blog, do show this correlation, while the full moon appears quite flat. Is this due to our inability to resolve contrast at such high illumination, given that the background is so dark?

They did no measurements at all on either the front or the back of the knees.

Carmel … From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin.” Later, she does indeed list nine different samples sites, and says that the other eight are all different from the Jerusalem/Shroud samples. She does not say if they were tested, but a geological map of Israel shows the extent of the Turonian limestone upon which Jerusalem is built, and her inference is fair enough. Turonian limestone is, however, fairly common throughout the world. I don’t know where you got the Gilberts identification from. Their sample plan shows that they did not look at either of the knee caps, and only the instep of one foot. They did look at the nose. Kohlbeck says his sample came from Rogers tape sample 1 AB (which is actually slightly to the side of the heel). The S Tu RP team did take samples from the right heel (1 DB) and right kneecap (2 CF), but not the left heel, left kneecap or nose.

Until that time, they were unanimous in declaring the image to be a feature of the shroud itself, and were confident that no coating of any kind was involved, even though “we expected to find starch on the shroud.” I do not find the discovery of an entirely superficial layer of starch created by an evaporation gradient very convincing, although I agree that it would be a convenient explanation. The idea that the expectation of finding starch on the shroud meant that they didn’t look for it, is ludicrous. Rogers’s photo of a few blue strands resulting from the evaporation of a ‘very dilute solution of a blue dye’ is interesting, but needs to be supplemented by experiments involving a rather less dilute solution of something starchy to contribute to an explanation of the shroud image. We also need to consider what should happen when the toasted coating was subsequently subject to a soaking in water, as evinced by the water stains. Rogers concluded by believing that “a combination of relatively rapid decomposing impurities on the surface of the cloth, with transfer/diffusion of catalytic compounds from a body” could account for the image. The relevance of his sideline into thermal radiation direction, and his mention of calculating “the temperature of a surface that would be sufficient to caramelise any of the possible sugars or starches on a cloth” is thus somewhat dubious. It reads as though as least some of his mind was on thermal, rather than chemical, degradation. One thing that Rogers explains well, and which I believe to be true, exactly contradicts Mottern, London and Morris’s paper on the X ray examination of the shroud. He says, of the manufacture of Holland cloth: “Considerable material was lost during the bleaching process, and the newer linens are less dense, as can be seen with the Holland cloth. The newer linens are also homogeneous. They do not show bands of different thread in the weave.” Mottern et al agree that “the holland cloth is a more loosely woven fabric than the linen,” but then say: “A few measurements indicate that the linen threads [of the shroud] are rather uniform 0.15mm. In contrast the thread diameters of the holland cloth vary from 0.1 to 0.45mm.” They also say: “The bands of high and low densities which run along the length and across the width are the result of the different thread diameters of the backing cloth. … In contrast, the linen threads are more uniform in diameter.” Mottern et al also describe the holland cloth as cotton. Although Rogers was referring to colour and Mottern to thread thickness, their divergent opinions of the homogeneity of the two cloths are irreconcilable..","date":"2013-09-04","mins":"9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"id":"comment-42957","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Sorry, Yannick, but this won’t do at all.

No evidence for a scorched medium can be seen.” Quote #3: “Microchemical studies of yellow fibrils taken from tape samples of the pure image area have shown no indication for the presence of dyes, stains, inorganic pigments, or protein , starch , or wax based painting media.” Quote #4: Direct visual observations of image areas that intersect scorch and water stains reveal nothing that might suggest the presence of organic dyes or water , protein , or starch based painting media.” And is it, in fact true that because “we expected to find starch on the shroud, so we did not specifically look for it”?

Mc Crone, it is true, found a few starch grains, not a layer. Simply repeating your previous posts does not, of itself, refute my criticisms of them. Your Quotes 36 and 37 refer to the alleged discovery of minute traces of starch by previous researchers, for which no evidence can be found, and Quote 38 refers to the Mc Crone statement about grains.

I cannot find it online, but in 1999 it was replied to, and refuted, by Nicholas Allen (of a photograph hypothesis), Nanette Smith and Roderick Woollgar. It is not clear whether their quotations from Mills come directly from his paper or from Knight and Lomas’s book The Second Messiah (1997), which uses Mills quite extensively for scientific support, and whose own photographic hypothesis Allen is keen to denigrate! Here are some significant passages from Allen et al’s article. “Mills is good enought to admit that although not ‘individually demanding’, the particular set of circumstances he needs for this image formation is ‘highly unlikely.’ ” “Singlet oxygen, contrary to the claims of Kight and Lomas, can only be produced by enzymic action within the phagocytes of the body. It is not possible for this highly reactive radical to pass to the outside of the human body. Mills also correctly explains that ‘it is not expected that a charged ion would be able to cross the cell membrane and enter the gas phase’, but he does go on to state that the excited form of the oxygen molecule, known as singlet oxygen (symbolised as 1 delta g O2) behaves as an activated form of normal oxygen and consequently is able to ‘cross membranes such as those in the lungs and red blood corpuscles’. This statement is somewhat misleading because in fact the activated oxygen is produced within the red blood corpuscle as part of the pentose phosphate shunt and is thus unable to escape the cell membrane as it is in existence for only a few nanoseconds”. All this is somewhat above my pay grade, but it may be interesting to hear Colin’s comments..","date":"2014-10-08","mins":"11:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"id":"comment-43353","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Thank you very much for taking the trouble to reply in such detail.

Scientists are not in the business of dogmatism. (He said, dogmatically…) Scientists weigh up evidence and assess probabilities. They suggest, they propose, they infer. Rogers was no exception. Although it is clear that he did not think much of religion in general, or particularly that the explanation for the image was miraculous, he was even clearer in his rejection of dogmatism. If the “Chapter One” referred to by Yannick is that of A Chemist’s Perspective, then a couple of quotes that will be familiar to him will illustrate the point. “Persons who believe in absolutes will be unhappy with science. Scientists will be unhappy with persons who demand that they “make up your minds.” “A scientist has no right to demand that a devout person withhold devotion of the Shroud until all of the scientific evidence is in. A devout person has no right to tell a scientist that he must stop all observations because everything that is needed is known from scriptures or feelings.” Later he even quotes Richard Feynman: “… if a thing is not scientific, if it cannot be subjected to the test of observation, this does not mean that it is dead, or wrong, or stupid.” “This does not mean that those things are unimportant. They are, in fact, in many ways the most important.” I think that’s quite generous from one whose instinct was to reject the supernatural altogether. Finally, to suggest that Rogers “clearly say that searching a supernatural explanation for the Shroud (just like Jackson, Rinaudo, Moran, Fanti, Di Lazzaro and a bunch of other researchers have done in recent years) is not at all a valid part of the true scientific method,” is not, in fact, true.

However, neither of these edges of colour represent the crown of the head, so it cannot be said that they show the heads separated by 15cm. The curved edge above the face is about level with the top of the forehead, and the straight edge at the back of the head a bit higher up. Assuming that the bottom edges of the line of bloodstains along the back of the head correspond roughly to the level of the inion of the external occipital protuberance, there is a distance of about 38cm between there and the bridge of the nose, which corresponds well to the same distance on my own head.

The distance from the bridge of the nose to the occiput is about 38cm, as noted above. Taking the top of the head as approximating half a sphere, this corresponds to about half a circumference. A cloth draped along the same contour, but 1cm away from the head, would increase the length by 3cm. That is just about acceptable, but if it were “a few cms away” the distance would be increased by almost 10cm, which is wholly inconsistent with the measurement of the Shroud. Also, the difference between a tightly wrapped cloth, and a cloth stretched horizontally behind the head, then vertically downwards grazing the top of the head, then back horizontally to the inion, is about 7cm. This is also inconsistent with the measurements made on the shroud.

I have been unable to produce red fluorescence even when scorching cloth in an oxygen free environment, so there may be something else which affected that fluorescence. Secondly, the entire cloth fluoresces quite brightly on its own, and I have no idea why. However it is difficult therefore to judge whether the faint image marks have a faint fluorescence of their own or not. My own experiments with heated spatulas, bas reliefs and so on invariably produce significant fluorescence as soon as, or even before, any discolouration of the cloth, but if the cloth was pre treated, for example with an alkaline wash or primer, then the lower temperature required to produce discolouration might do so without producing fluorescence.

I’m afraid I will not be exploring the quantum possibilities of the shroud. I have a school laboratory, a UV light and a microscope, but not a Large Hadron Collider. Not even a Small Hadron Collider, in fact. Sadly I suspect current speculation about quantum processes forming the image can scarcely be termed even a hypothesis.

After discussing the problems with Jackson’s hypothesis – “of a body wrapped by the Shroud that becomes mechanically transparent while emitting VUV radiation” – and Rogers’s experiments – “samples often were converted into a little amorphous powder and gas” – di Lazzaro explains that by finding the correct parameters he has succeeded in demonstrating that “VUV radiation is truly capable of generating a Shroud like colouration of linen cloths.” But he goes on to admit that in terms of a dead body emitting these VUV pulses, something beyond the realm of science is required. “How can one untie the knot of this impasse? As scientists, we are not entitled to argue about theological and philosophical implications of a flash of VUV radiation as a possible by product of resurrection. We are only qualified to investigate the complex chain of chemical and physical processes triggered by VUV radiation on cellulose/hemicellulose, that produce conjugated carbonyl groups as the chromophore, or, in simpler words, a Shroud like colouration of linen. We did this scientific work, and we have made our experimental results and related arguments public, that is, in our papers.” Now all he can do is wait. So, go back to your gratuitous abuse: “How nice,coming as it is from the editor of the BSTS newsletter,” and see whether it is justified by what I actually said, rather than what you think I may have meant. Joe is completely correct in that a true assessment of the Shroud must not begin with an assumption that it is one thing or another. However, Science works by proposing an idea, and then attempting to justify or reject it. We may say: IF the cloth was made by an artist / by a corpse, then how might it have occurred? We may even say: perhaps it was by something outside the realm of science, but in that case it is pointless to try to investigate its cause further. Colin is exploring a painting hypothesis. To do that he must begin with an “IF the Shroud was made by an artist” assumption. Di Lazzaro is exploring a radiation hypothesis. To do that he must begin with either an “IF a corpse can produce radiation” assumption or an “IF the Shroud was produced by a miracle” assumption, or there would be no point in pursuing his experiments. I believe David Mo was rather more dogmatic than I would be in declaring a 99% certainty that the Shroud is medieval, but that does not justify Antero’s “Once more skeptics show themselves ignorant about serious scientific studies on the Shroud and uncover their fanatic anti authenticity agenda driven comments.” As I have pointed out many times recently, non authenticist views are almost invariably based on detailed study of the “serious scientific studies” while authenticists frequently appear not to have read it at all..","date":"2015-04-01","mins":"6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/31/whats-to-like-over-on-colins-blog-right-now/","cat":"image_theory","title":"What’s to like over on Colin’s blog right now?"},{"id":"comment-195096","author":"hugh_farey","post":"« authenticists frequently appear not to have read it at all.» This is not fair.

More the first than the second in my case. Anyway, OK’s FF Ts are interesting, and best of all, offer anybody the chance to explore them on their own. However, I’m not sure he has destroyed the ‘painting’ hypothesis with his ‘lack of directionality’ evidence. Walter Mc Crone came up with the idea that the image could have been made by smudging a pigment laden finger across the cloth, but rejected it on the grounds that the threads would act as “snow fences” (his word), so drifts of pigment would pile up against them as the finger moved across. I imagine that much the same would happen with paint, and no such drifts are observed anywhere. Mc Crone’s solution was to quote at some length from Sir Charles Lockwood’s book ‘Methods and Materials of Painting of the Great Schools and Masters’ which describes an unusual tempera, typical of England and Germany, which was ideal for painting on cloth, which was extremely dilute, and which appeared almost transparent. In these very dilute circumstances, there is no reason why and directionality would be apparent, even if the cloth were painted. There is also the possibility that the ‘paint’, if there was any, was dabbed on vertically, and the blood dripped on with a pipette. In these cases too, no directionality would necessarily be created. What I find quite strange about OK’s FF Ts of the Shroud, and still need to explore, is that his photographs of the Shroud show very obvious directionality which is clear to the naked eye, namely the weave of the cloth. I find it curious that the FFT, which OK says can recognise directionality, is unable to recognise thick obvious diagonal stripes across the page. Or can it cunningly tell the difference between the directionality of the image and the directionality of the cloth, even from a simple black and white photograph?.","date":"2014-11-12","mins":"12:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/why-the-images-and-bloodstains-were-not-painted-on/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Why the images and bloodstains were not painted on"},{"id":"comment-157209","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Colin makes a good point which takes us away from the scientific into the historical context for a possible creation of the Shroud in the 13th or 14th century. He is correct in that, as it stands, the Shroud is far too ‘good.’ Charles will explain this better, no doubt, but I think the essence of a relic was not what it looked like, but how many red episcopal seals attested to its authenticity. Any old bone, any old coat, plants, ironmongery, even any old painting could attract thousands as long as it was solemnly assured to be genuine. At Glastonbury (though I was told this long ago and it may be apocryphal), worried that Walsingham was cornering the market in pilgrimages, it was enough simply to engrave “Hic iacet Arturus” on a slab to attract a new and plentiful source of income to the ‘authentic’ grave of King Arthur and his queen. There was no need to attempt to produce an authentic looking replica of something. If a miracle was involved in the production of a portrait, why shouldn’t it look like a painting anyway? That is why I am more interested in the epitaphios of Eastern Christian ritual. I was intrigued to see that the painting on linen referenced by Mike M a few posts ago is described as a Shroud. Many of the Fayum figures were full length portraits, apparently intended to be placed over the mummies of their subjects. The reason for this is not really known, and the practice died out in the 3rd century, but there may be an echo of it in some Byzantine rites of the Catholic Church, in which the body of Christ, represented by the eucharist, is placed on (and sometimes wrapped in) a cloth specifically stated to represent a shroud. Recently (well, for the last five hundred years or so!), this symbolic shroud (the epitaphios) actually has another shroud painted on it, and the body of Christ lying on that, and often an entire lamentation scene around it, so the cloth itself is a mere carrier for the representation, but echoes of the cloth as itself the shroud may be found in the katasarkion (also strachitsa or srachitsa), a plain linen sheet which is the first cover of the Byzantine altar, fastened to it and not removed after the altar is consecrated. Somewhere between the katasarkion and the epitaphios, I feel, there may have been an intermediate stage in which a cloth, representing the shroud, was given a plain image. There are various reasons why the cloth may have been long and thin (to drape over an altar about 2m long being one of them) and why the image of the dead body was represented as two figures lying head to head (to fill the cloth with image, and to have heads, rather than feet, directly under the rituals of the altar), two aspects of the Shroud which do not imediately make sense in the context of a real burial (when a single body length sheet is more typical – although there are a few old Egyptian exceptions – and placing the body so that the last thing to be covered is the head also seems more appropriate). Pure speculation I agree, and if anyone can point me to the development of the epitaphios/katasarkion between, say, the iconoclasm and 1400 AD I’d be fascinated to read it, but development there must have been, and the Shroud would fit quite nicely in that gap. In this context, I feel, the exact nature of the painting could have been any of a number of things, including brush and paint or dabbing, colour or monochrome, realistic or impressionistic, or whatever. And finally – where are all the others? Well quite. There are no contemporary altar covers to compare the Shroud to at all, similar or dissimilar. Pity. Perhaps a reader knows of one?.","date":"2014-09-27","mins":"8:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/27/why-the-shroud-is-not-a-painting/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why the Shroud is not a Painting"},{"id":"comment-18868","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Clearly ‘a reader’ (should that be ‘a casual visitor’?) does not actually read much of the “endless blogging” or he would have learnt that miracles rarely get much of a look in, at least round here.

To clarify: a) the flax fibres were coated with something before they were spun into threads, perhaps as part of the purification process. If this were the case, and the image forming mechanism is strong enough to affect this layer, but not the rest of the fibre, I would expect the image forming mechanism to colour all around the fibres it affected, probably quite deeply into the thread, and by conduction along the coating, be visible on the back of the cloth. (The PCW hypothesis would produce a similar result). The appearance would look a bit like cloth does after it has been kept in an oven for a while – rather uniform. B) the threads were treated after they had been spun, perhaps as part of the weaving process. If this were the case, then ‘interior’ fibres, or the interior parts of fibres if they disappear into the middle of a thread would not be affected by the mechanism, but the image would appear at least deep into the valleys between the warp threads. It could also appear on the back by capillary action. C) the whole cloth was treated after being woven, perhaps as part of a washing process. In this case, the solutes appear prominently on the external faces of the cloth, and less, possibly much less, in the middle. This seems to be the basis of Rogers’s ammonia experiments, which were done on whole cloth. I too am not crazy about starch, as I don’t find it reacts as well as plain linen to heat or chemicals.

The other day I took some cloth to our local blacksmith, who kindly heated an iron bar (about 8 x 5 x 0.5 cm) to 1000°C – which you can tell partially by the sudden loss of magnetism at the Curie point (770°C) and partially by the colour, and then dropped it on the cloth. The first sample caught fire and burnt to shreds quite quickly, even in a tin with the lid only allowing a tiny amount of air in, but the second, which was from a different sample, behaved beautifully shroud like, and although we threw a bit of water in after 10 minutes, the chars were restricted to the area of the bar. All 32 layers were neatly scorched in decreasing sizes, just like the Shroud. So far so good, but now comes the interesting bit. Having dried out the cloth and laid it on the floor, I set up a camera to photograph a good sample burn area, and then brought my UV lamp up to check the fluorescence. In all my previous experiments, I have had the lamp on, and brought the samples to it to be photographed, but this I think must be the first time that I have observed the fluorescence from the moment the lamp was switched on, as it were. To my amazement, the first thing to see was a thin red fluorescent border around the char holes, and none around the various nearby scorch marks, just as described on the Shroud. You may remember that I have never observed the red fluorescence, in spite of determined attempts to scorch cloth in an oxygen free environment. However, while I was getting excited about this, the lamp continued to heat up – it takes about 5 minutes to reach full power – and the red fluorescence disappeared, and the familiar greeny yellow fringe took its place, around the chars, and around the scorches, just as I have observed before, as seen in your posting of 19 Dec 2012, “Guest posting from Hugh Farey (yipee – another science bod!): here’s a snapshot of his current studies of scorching and uv fluorescence.” So, it seems to me that neither your UV source, nor that of the STURP team, is/was powerful enough to detect the fluorescence around the scorches, although it may have produced a red fluorescence around chars. The implications are that, yes, scorches always fluoresce, but only at high power. There is thus no reason why the ‘image’ of the Shroud is not a scorch! I’ll be writing all this up, with photos, in the December BSTS Newsletter.

And who knows, maybe Colin’s scorch experiments will help inform the radiationists, and some clever synthesis of the two be a satisfactory result!

It is wildly speculative, wholly unconfirmed by experiment, and largely scientifically incoherent. “The processes of morphogenesis, growth, differentiation and regeneration are also explained by the structuring and regulating activity of the coherent biophoton field. The holographic biophoton field of the brain and the nervous system, and maybe even that of the whole organism, may also be basis of memory and other phenomena of consciousness, as postulated by neurophysiologist Karl Pribram an others. The consciousness like coherence properties of the biophoton field are closely related to its base in the properties of the physical vacuum and indicate its possible role as an interface to the non physical realms of mind, psyche and consciousness.”.","date":"2013-10-19","mins":"9:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/how-do-we-know-no-directionality-of-light/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"How do we know?

From my own researches I can say this: 1) The UV photos of the Shroud were done by Miller and Pelicori and are published in the Journal of Biological Photography but are not available on the internet. Considerable care was taken to exclude any visible light emission from the UV source, so that the image captured on film was entirely due to fluorescence. I mention this because all the UV images show considerable background fluorescence which largely masks any extra due to image, scorches, blood serum and so on. There is no apparent fluorescence caused by the body image, but it is possible that there is some which is masked by the background. Those parts of the burn scorches which are dark in visible light are also dark in UV, but they are often fringed in a pale reddish orange fluorescence, while the rest of the UV marks are greenish blue. There seems to be no fluorescence attached to the ‘poker holes.’ 2) I have never been able to create reddish fluorescence using a scorch. When I heat an object and press it several times onto linen until it is cool, I find that at the lowest temperature to form a visible mark, however faint, it fluoresces brightly. I have not been able to make the cloth fluoresce without making a visible mark, but that may simply be that I have not had exactly the right temperature. As the temperature increases, the dark scorch/char itself does not fluoresce, but is surrounded by a bright halo which does..","date":"2014-12-15","mins":"12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/15/is-fluorescence-still-in-question/","cat":"science","title":"Is Fluorescence Still in Question?"},{"id":"comment-176999","author":"hugh_farey","post":"We are often told what hypotheses are worthless, but seldom which ones are not.

Anyone who wants to compare a ‘crease before the image with a crease after the image would do well to look at the creases bracketing the top and bottom of the face on the Shroud on shroud Scope. On the “Enrie negative” page they are both very prominent, although the lower one is both brighter and has a faint ‘twin’ image just below. On the “Durante 2002” page, the top crease has all but vanished, while the lower one has widened considerably and resolved itself into two distinct lines (the upper darker than the lower) with a channel between them which is paler than the cloth above and below the crease marks. It is likely that the appearance of the upper crease in the Enrie photo is merely an artifact of the direction of the light and shadow, which is almost negated by the new flatness of the Shroud, while the colours of the lower crease are genuine linear discolourations of the cloth (no doubt enhanced by the light and shadow in the Enrie photo, but not removed by smoothing out the crease).

I had a go myself but i Photo (all I’ve got) is not subtle enough. It seems to me that the drop of blood right at the end of the distinctive 3 shape on the forehead has a light patch in the middle, which could be as a result of a thick encrustation peeling off. The other place is at the back of the head, where, to be frank, the blood stains look as if they have bubbles in them – again, light patches which may be the result of thick bits coming away. If there was no body image (scorch, if you like) under them, then the colour should be perhaps pale pink (???) being the stain left behind by the blood, and nothing else. If there is an image under them, then it should be darker, a combination of the brown image and and pink blood residue. Another place to look for pale spots in the blood might be the dribble from one of the feet, which clearly continues into places where there is no image. Back to Rogers. The paper I quoted does not seem to me to concern scorching at all, being all about nuclear radiation, specifically from thorium. How comparable the results of nuclear radiation are with lowish temperature scorching I don’t know. Having irradiated some flax for a week with thorium, it would have been pretty simply just to scorch a bit for comparison, but that was presumably not the object of Rogers’s exercise. His conclusion that, when examined under polarising light, image and non image threads look the same (although one photo is very blurred) may be significant in terms of emitted particles, but I don’t think his paper establishes that it is relevant to scorching, at least not to me, or, presumably, you! There is a lot in the literature claiming that scorching always damages the medulla of flax fibres, and that the shroud fibres do not show such damage, but I have not found a paper that substantiates that yet. I’m a little perplexed as to the use of the word medulla, which (although it’s perfectly clear what it means) is usually applied to animal rather than plant material.

The answer to the first lies in the chemical structure of cellulose, about which I know little, and its appearance in polarised light, about which I know nothing. I haven’t read the original papers in any detail, but there seems to be some confusion between threads (being the long thin stuff the weaver used), fibres (being the little twisty bits that make up the threads), and cellulose molecules. It is obvious that threads can be scorched on one side, you can see that with the naked eye. I think it is obvious under a microscope that fibres can be scorched on one side, or at least damaged more in one place than another, although I haven’t been able to verify that personally (yet); but I know nothing about the molecular composition of each fibre, and would need to read the original papers more carefully than I have done so far to see if the polarised light experiments really do preclude scorching, which I doubt. As I understand it, cellulose is a fairly elaborate and extensive network of sub components (glucose units), which can surely be damaged in some places without affecting others. Heating it is not, I surmise, an all or nothing affair – unlike, say, heating a single glucose molecule, which cannot but cause total decomposition. As to the second, I suppose that if I were wedded to a photographic or chemical or burst of cosmic rays origin, I would cling to any evidence, however tenuous, that the marks are not scorches. Nothing else springs to mind, but perhaps you have better ideas than I. Anyway, my next job is to try to understand Ray Rogers’s “Radiation Effects, Aging and Image Formation” whose abstract concludes that “the image could not have involved energetic radiation of any kind; photons, electrons, protons, alpha particles and/or neutrons.” That seems quite dogmatic!

I’ve done experiments of various kinds on pieces of cloth for 30 years (heat, light, UV, acids, alkalies, myhrr, aloes, sweat, you name it) without convincing myself that I know how the image was made. However I have never had access to the high definition (although sadly not high enough for what I want now) photography of Shroud Scope, and it really has just struck me that we’re all working from pictures, with all their optical imperfections, rather than the artifact itself. I don’t even know if all the diagonal hatching (shadow, reflection or refraction) is actually visible at all in some lighting conditions. Part of the clarity of your scorch from the mask in your banner above comes from the exposure of the cloth so that the individual threads which are not scorched are hardly visible; it may be that the shroud would look very similar if it was photographed in the same way. It should at least be much easier to differentiate scorch marks (if so they are) from liquid flows (if so they are) which would be expected to follow the ridges and furrows of the threads. As for my fascination for minutiae, there are a steadily decreasing number of fields open to original discovery by independent researchers with no facilities, and any original discoveries i have made are indeed extremely minute. The Shroud is not something I’ve thought much about for a few years, as I’ve been concentrating on the history of the Olympic Games recently, but again, delving into some tiny details to try to derive original research from them. Here’s another bit of minutiae, for example. The famous crease across the neck of the shroud has a sort of dip, or shallow V, almost in the centre, in a light patch of the beard. Is that V real, or is the shroud lightly creased vertically at that point, and we are looking at the horizontal crease going down one side and up the other? If the V is real, then why is it there or how did it get there? It may be trivial, but it’s the sort of thing that absorbs me. If you’ve found my entry on the BSTS meetup site, you’ll know that I’m a Catholic and a Science teacher, and might have thought I was a “let’s try and invent some science to explain a miracle” sort of scientist. Nothing could be further than the truth. In common with most orthodox Catholic theologians who have faced up to miracles (including the Pope, according to the second volume of his life of Jesus) I fully expect the accounts of what happened physically to be thoroughly explicable in conventional scientific terms. Theologians are now exploring how (and why) these events affected the people who witnessed them and how they were used to illustrate a new (and better?) life style; they are not (mostly) bothering about the science.

If I heat a crucible lid to red heat and drop it on linen, it makes (of course) a charred black rim, and a radiated heat non contact brown scorch in the middle – about 3mm from lid to linen. If I do the same with a spoon, the scorch is about 3cm wide, corresponding to a radiated distance of 3 or 4mm. If I heat a spatula for ten seconds or so, and press it on the cloth, I make a mark which superficially looks very similar. At least it’s the same colour. However, under the microscope it is obvious that the contact marks are very specific, just on the thread fibres which have been in contact, and definitely not continuing into the places where the fibres go underneath other threads, while the radiated marks are much more even, and, when the threads are separated, it is difficult (read impossible) to see any difference between places directly exposed and places where the fibres passed under others. Why this should be I can’t really say. I guessing that under radiated heat the fibres are able to conduct the energy away and discolour all the way along, but in contact they can’t. Something to do with the suddenness of the arrival of the heat? Back to UV. I made some marks by pressing a hot spatula along a strip of linen, then cut the linen in two longitudinally, dividing all the marks in two, and washed one half in slightly soapy water then left it to soak for an hour, then dried it and put it back with the untouched half for comparison. Sadly, although the scorch marks seem to have been somewhat scrubbed off, the UV fluorescence is apparently unchanged. Can you think of anything else I might do to get rid of it? My camera is not good enough to adjust for focussing in the dark, and still pictures are disappointing; however a video camera seems to be able to manage a bit better. Would you like me to send some screen shots of these experiments? I have found an email address from an earlier post, and would be happy to do so if you’d like. Next, the BSTS meeting was interesting (particularly as there were life size photos to pore over), and although in principle extremely controversial, very polite! David Rolfe did not pursue the Dawkins Challenge at all. He read out a goodwill message from Ian Wilson (now living in New Zealand) with interpolations of his own, from which two new movements came to light. Someone in America is reviewing the pollen sample slides, both those taken by Max Frie and those by other members of the STURP team, with a view to explaining the rather different interpretations different people have made of them; and also (quite exciting) a mould for making Lirey/Cluny pilgrimage badges has been found. I didn’t know about that, but immediately Googled “Lirey pelerinage moule” and find a photo of it as the front cover of a book – still only published in France as yet. It does not seem to be the mould for the famous badge, but certainly for one very similar. Thomas de Wesselow then expounded in detail why he thought the two components of the shroud image, image and blood, were “technically, stylistically and conceptually” incompatible with 14th century art or forgery (I know you and many others disagree, and he did not reveal anything blindingly new, but he set out his arguments clearly and with many illustrations), and then went on, perhaps more diffidently, to explain why he thinks the shroud and The Risen Christ were in fact one and the same, and thus the foundation of Christianity. I found that difficult to take, I must say. Christian or not, to found a lasting worldwide religion on the basis of a stained sheet seems quite a tough deal to me – probably more of a miracle than bringing a man back to life! Finally a medical lady whose name I didn’t catch ran through the image as pathology, with some real Roman nails and a flagrum mock up based on the famous remains found in Pompei. It was interesting for me as I had only seen these things on telly before, but not revelatory; and Tony Luby, a teacher, explained how he used the shroud in his RCRE classes.

I am open to the possibility that the image was not formed by a real body, or even a real body shape – not convinced, by any means, but certainly open to the possibility. I would hardly have spent the last few months singeing linen if I had rejected the possibility of a scorch. However, in this case, my personal views are irrelevant. We are constructing a critical summary of “A critical summary of … hypotheses” and surely, any such document that begins by denying the possibility of half the hypotheses it seeks to summarise deserves a certain amount of criticism. I agree that the pollen, the limestone and the artistic archaeology are evidence in favour of authenticity, but all of them have been sensibly queried, and are not as persuasive to me as they are to you. Mario Latendresse’s paper is excellent in its way, but I think fails to comment on some things and fails to notice others. He suggests that the biggest distortions of image should lie where the covering cloth is most steeply angled away from the horizontal. These include the sides of the arms (not commented upon), the hips, and the sides of the legs (not noticed). The width of the hips ‘photographically’ (without distortion) can be calculated as line B + line D + the distance between them (11 squares x 1.11cm) – about 27.2cm. By counting squares, the ‘image’ of the hips has a width of 36.6cm. This 35% increase is charmingly dismissed with “some observable widening of the hip is expected” and “such an apparent widening has been observed.” However the widest part of the front of the body (hips) corresponds in the rear to the buttocks. Measurements using Shroud Scope give about 36cm across the hips, and, not too surprisingly, about 34cm across the buttocks. Now if we assume that the hip image is distorted by draping cloth, and the buttock image is not, it is clear that the front would be far too thin. As for the legs, Latendresse’s photos show his cloth draping the legs quite closely, but he does not explore the distortion thus caused. If I measure the bottom edge of his photo with a ruler, and then in his cloth squares, I get an undistorted width of about 24.7cm, and an image width of 33.3cm, an increase of 35% across the width of the image, not borne out by the image on the shroud.

Marion used “many” photographs taken in “various lighting conditions and “used PCA” to derive his final results.

There is no indication of where or how any negative results were obtained. The famous three Hebrew letters are bigger than some of his observations (well over 1cm in height), and placed exactly between two of them. It would be interesting to know whether that area was processed. In spite of apparent detail, it would be impossible impartially to replicate his method using this description alone, however well versed one was in using PCA. That is what I call sketchy. If the single set of illustrations leading to PE Zw is a good example of a successful process, then I find them unconvincing, and would have liked similar photographs of several of the others for comparison. In order to exclude pareidolia, five criteria are listed for the verification of his inscriptions: “If these five conditions are simultaneously verified, the probability of an artefact becomes very small.” – Remarkably, perhaps, not one of his inscriptions adheres to all five, and all have to be heavily ‘interpreted’ to make any sense of them at all. No doubt Optical Engineering was impressed with the skill with which Marion was able to derive his letters, and perhaps more so by the dexterity with which they were manipulated to reach his conclusions – I’m impressed myself – but in spite of all the science I still find no objective evidence that any of them is actually there at all..","date":"2013-04-17","mins":"7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/14/the-making-of-the-hd-image-for-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Making of the HD Image for the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-23759","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I consider it an honour for the author of such an excellent paper to comment on my comment. His sort of experimentation is exactly what the shroud world needs, and his explanation of how he derived his findings is a model of clarity. Nevertheless, I do not think that the principle point of the paper – that the image on the shroud is compatible with a draped rather than a horizontal shroud, has been established. The places where distortion would be most visible would be the places where the shroud dropped furthest away from horizontal, such as the back of the head, the sides of the arms, hips and legs, and not across the face or along the arms. Carefully laying his sheet across his model, there are several places (lines B and D being his best examples) where he finds that a draped cloth would produce an image up to 35% wider than the ‘photographic’ image which might be expected from a horizontal cloth. I do not find this distortion in the shroud. Where the front and back images can be directly compared, i.e. Across the widest part of the body in the hip region, the distances are very similar. It doesn’t matter at what magnification or what image of the shroud you use. Either one finds that the ventral image is 35% wider than the dorsal image, or one does not, and I do not. I do find it a few centimetres wider, as, no doubt did Ercoline, although quoting him as a supporter without stating whether he agrees with Latendresse (that the widths differ by 35%) or me (that they differ by less than 10%) is a trifle unfair, I think.

Perhaps the simplest is that the cloth was not wrapped around, but draped over the body. Imagine a body lying on a length of cloth on a slab, with a lot of extra cloth beyond the head. If two men stood, head and foot, holding that bit of cloth horizontally between them and lowered it over the body, then the length connecting the top and bottom would be loose, and flop down beyond the top of the head. Another possibility is that the whole body was encased in blocks or bags of spices (100 pounds of myrrh and aloes, perhaps), and the cloth drawn over the blocks around the head.

Although I don’t really disagree with his conclusions – the man is quite an ordinary man – I think the mathematical calculations give a wholly unwarranted precision, given the subjective nature of almost all the measurements, and the assumptions made about angles of the head, knees and ankles and so on. Early on in the paper, there is quite an interesting diagram of the two images superimposed on one another. It is worth trying this out for yourself, using either a shroudscope image or, better for this purpose, the photos at http://shroud.wikispaces.com/PROPERTIES. The two images are, indeed superimposable. However, if the man had bent knees, and the bottom of the shroud was laid flat, and the top was draped over the body, the bottom image should show a) considerable foreshortening, and b) no image between the buttock and the heels. If (as Marinelli speculates) the bottom of the shroud was held up by pillows so that it makes contact with the legs, the legs would still appear shorter underneath than on top, as the top surface has to drape over the knees, while the bottom surface does not. Other uncertainties concern the width of the image, which might be extended on top by some factor due to being draped across the body, and extended on the bottom by the weight of the body flattening out the buttocks, etc. Given these speculations, look at Marinelli’s Section 5 – Uncertainty Analysis. My interpretation… 1) We don’t know whether the image is rounded slightly over the top of the head, or is a flat image. Guess 3% error. 2) We don’t know if the head was bent on not. Guess plus or minus 3cm. 3) We don’t know if the linen has stretched. Guess 2% error. 4) We don’t know if the draping of the cloth makes the front image too long in respect of the back. Guess 7.5% too long. [In my opinion it would make more sense to call the dorsal image 7.5% too short, but that’s by the bye] 5) We don’t know if the back of the sheet was brought up to make contact with the legs. Guess 1% too long. [This doesn’t mean anything to me] 6) We don’t know if wrinkles on the sheet mean the images occupy a greater length than they should. Guess 2% too long. 7) We don’t know if the S bend of the backbone may be relevant. Guess add 1cm. [Nor does this] 8) A man lying down is longer than him standing up. Guess 2cm too long. 9) We don’t know if the linen has shrunk. Or not. Guess let’s leave it as it is. If we take the uncertainty extremes of all Marinelli’s guesses, we have to accept the man in the shroud was between about 4 feet and 10 feet high, with arms and legs roughly in proportion.

For start the cloth itself has been pulled about a bit, distorting the image slightly, but most of the differences are caused by different ideologies rather than different measurements.

If, on the other hand, the man was laid with his head on a pillow and his legs bent at the knee, and the bottom of the cloth was flat but the top was draped along his body and folded down the sides, then the bottom image would show much shorter legs than the top, and the upper image would be much wider than the bottom.

In its heyday I was a keen contributor, and a number of well informed people also took part, although there was sporadic acrimony. If you were interested you could do worse than start at the beginning (https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/page/12/) and follow it through, especially the comments. That was how I rejoined mainline shroud research after several years of neglect. As to the Mark 1/Mark 2 hypothesis. There is much to be said for it. However, it doesn’t adapt well to an ‘evidence for versus evidence against’ kind of trial, so just consider what follows as a fairly off th cuff collection of ideas thrown into the meting pot! The shroud does look like something left behind after something else has gone. I have a piece of Indonesian batik framed on my wall. Although I have no intention of taking it apart, I wonder if, if the covering glass and the batik was removed, there might be some sort of image on the paper backing? The vague appearance of the shroud image owes much to its faintness, its monochromaticity, and its superficiality, all characteristics that could be a result of it being either a backing cloth, or a deliberate transfer experiment of some kind. So what might have been Mark 1, and what happened to it? Perhaps a medieval painting. Might the pigment have remained on the original and the solvent stained the backing? Was it destroyed in the 1532 fire? Destroyed by accident elsewhere? Destroyed deliberately when it was discovered that the ‘backing’ was more ‘realistic’? Or separated from the backing, only to turn up a few years later as the Shroud of Besançon? Or was Mark 1 an original relic, which, as you suggest finally deteriorated to the point of falling part, leaving the backing? Of course that opens the can of worms which even authenticists can’t agree on, namely how the Mark 1 image was made, whether the shroud was wrapped, draped or horizontal over the body, and so on. As for the C 14 date, doubts about its accuracy fall into three general areas. The first suggestion was contamination by oil, paint, smoke, grime, fibres from vestments, a ‘bioplastic’ coating, bacteria, etc. Etc. This has largely been discredited even by authenticists; it is clear that all this extraneous gunk would have been completely washed away by the cleaning processes carried out by the labs. The current argument is about the possibility that the sample was actually made of 16th century interpolation, either a patch or a clever reweaving. It would mean that about 70% of the C 14 sample was new, and only 30% original. It’s a sensible idea, but it seems unlikely that such an interpolation would be completely invisible, even after intense scrutiny. The final idea is that the original cloth somehow had its C 14 content changed. Apart from wild speculation, two proper experiments have been carried out. The first did demonstrate that intense neutron radiation can indeed change C 12 to C 14 in a piece of cloth. Whether this was likely as a feature of the resurrection is question of religious faith rather than science. A more realistic experiment, to find out if ‘modern’ carbon monoxide could be incorporated into an ‘ancient’ cloth during an episode of intense heat, thus changing the C 14 proportion, was a complete failure. Finally – the naked Jesus. Well why not? Most medieval paintings of the resurrection show him naked, albeit with the odd wisp of random material to prevent sacrilege. The ‘physics of the supernatural’ is to me a complete oxymoron, but some people speculate. Jesus almost literally exploded in a nuclear blast (mysteriously leaving the rest of Jerusalem intact) and reappeared in a completely different assemblage of matter elsewhere, with or without clothing. Jesus simply miraculously ‘healed,’ woke up, drew aside the bedclothes and walked out (naked or draped in a spare bit of gravecloth). Jesus suddenly dematerialised, leaving a body shaped vacuum which collapsed with an audible pop, the shroud falling down through the space, and then reappeared elsewhere, in whichever form he chose. All good fun. Other scenarios are possible. That should give you food for thought!.","date":"2013-08-20","mins":"10:29 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/who-says-the-shroud-is-not-a-scorch-mark-and-more-to-the-point-why/","cat":"permalink","title":"Who says the Shroud is not a scorch mark – and more to the point, WHY?"},{"id":"comment-959","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Fun with Linen. Not finding any in the house I ebayed a piece and have spent a day happily experimenting in my school laboratory, with a Bunsen Burner, a couple of microscopes and a UV lamp. Firstly, I cannot, at any temperature, scorch the stuff without making it fluoresce. This was quite exciting for me as most cloth these days fluoresces anyway (probably being treated with something) but the linen wasn’t/didn’t until I heated it. Placing a hot spatula on it, in the dark, illuminated only by the light of a Bunsen burner and the UV lamp, produces a dark scorch, of varying depth, surrounded by a clear halo of pale green fluorescence, which also fills up the scorch area itself, except where it is charred to carbon. Carrying out the experiment you suggested, of repeatedly placing the hot object against the cloth until nothing seems to occur, shows that even when the scorch is barely visible, or even not visible at all, the fluorescence is quite clear. Next, trying to compare linen with cotton, it seemed to me that the cotton did not conduct heat as well as linen, because, after pulling apart some charred fragments under a microscope, it was easier to obtain banding (the threads not coloured where they passed underneath others, but charred where they were on the top) with cotton than with linen. A very good effect could be produced even on linen, however, if instead of heating a spatula, I used a pin, and rolled it gently over the surface (instead of pressing down with the spatula). Remarkably, the most shroud like markings I could make were when, so that I could find them more easily, I drew a circle around one with a fibre tipped pen. Astonishing. The ink remained only on the topmost fibres (and, when a fibre was examined under high power, only on one side of some fibres), and clearly didn’t flow into the dips where the threads pass over and under each other, except very occasionally when it seemed to stain a few individual fibres and turned up on the other side of the cloth. I don’t know how big ink particles are, but nothing particulate could be resolved at 400 X. The marks were blue, of course… Lots more experiments suggest themselves to me, but I thought I’d let you know how I got on before I go to the meeting tomorrow. Perhaps I’ll find out about the ‘conspiracy of silence’ about scorches, Maillard reactions and such like. I’ve not heard that you’ll be there, but if not, and you’d like me to raise anything specific, and scientific, I would do my best (if I could understand the chemistry!). I believe Thomas de Wesselow will try to explain how Christian belief in the resurrection was really founded on a dirty corpse wrapping… And of course, I wish him luck….","date":"2012-10-20","mins":"5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

However, we have to start from somewhere. Would a badly beaten up man bleed more or less? Shock, I understand, is typified by very low blood pressure, but may encourage coagulopathy. The side wound. Blood coming out of a cut on a upright person dribbles downwards; it does not zig zag. If the ‘bloodstains’ coming from the ‘wound’ on the side are real, they must be postmortem, with the body propped up or slumped forwards. So what has happened to all the blood that emerged from the wound while it was still on the cross. Washed off? As for the foot, it seems completely covered, which is what I would expect from an injury at the lower end of the body. This time not washed off, perhaps. It’s all rather inconsistent..","date":"2013-11-15","mins":"8:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.
