But being nice doesn’t make it correct… Although the depiction of scourge wounds is indeed rare, especially as early as the 9th century, they are more common in psalters and other less public works than in big paintings. The marks here are on a body only a few centimetres high, so the fact that there are only 20 or so, each one representing a cut about 10cm long, should not count against them. However, it is quite wrong to call them “realistic.” Both the Ducio and Colombe paintings are considerably more so. Lorenzetto and Huguet also attempt realism, while Memling, for example, clearly stylises the effect. De Wesselow is probably correct in saying that artists deliberately shied away from any confusion with the “five wounds.” Next, however, we are told the artist accurately depicted the Roman flagrum. Regular readers will know this is one of my hobby horses, but the flagrum in the accompanying photo was not “recovered from the Roman City of Herculaneum”, and nor does Wilson, to whom this absurdity seems to be attributed, say it was. I believe it was made specifically to fit the marks made on the shroud in the early 20th century. Then we move to the “smoking gun”, which is the unnatural depiction of “curved fingers” apparently mimicking the epsilon blood stain. It is clear that neither Jones nor Hamon are familiar with many others of the 150 or so illustrations in the Stuttgart psalter, the majority of which contain unnaturally curved fingers, a hefty proportion of which are in exactly the same configuration as they are here. Several of these show people pointing to their own head, which I believe to be a convention representing thinking, and perhaps by corollary, guilt.

The hand gestures of the Stuttgart psalter almost certainly mean something, and are not exclusive to that work, although it seems to be one of the most expressive.

Max Patrick Hamon (sse above), whose work I have a lot of respect for although we drive each other up the wall sometimes, has had a go at the one with the two middle fingers clenched, suggesting either evil horns or victory horns according to which hand is doing it and where it is pointing, but there are several others, including that spidery pair of scissors to which I think you are referring. I’m glad you found us.

Not a smidgin. The crease is modern. No old painting can be based upon it. I don’t understand your reference to the Manopello painting, which probably dates to the late middle ages. Now, why don’t paintings show a uniform collection of abnormalities? Are we to suppose that every pantocrator painter had personal experience of the shroud, and they each picked out their own selection of imperfections? Some went for forked beards, some didn’t notice that the beard was forked but did spot a minutely visible imperfection in the weave between the eyes? The arbitrary selection of this or that characteristic is, I think, the main argument against these Vignon markings having credibility. The St Catherine’s Pantocrator is one of the earliest. It seems to come from Constantinople in the 6th century. It shows no sign of having been derived from the shroud. The major features, the droopy moustache, the long pointed beard, the round shape of the hair around the head, and so on, bear no resemblance to the shroud. Even the asymmetric eyebrows and the bag under the left eye owe nothing to the shroud.Dozens of Pantocrators seem to be derived from this model. Christ wears a blue robe, carries a bible in his left hand and blesses with the right. The other Pantocrator you link to is in Delphi, in Greece. This one is also typical of its group which represent a more graphic and sylised art form, with lots of well defined lines on the forehead and neck. There is possibly a greater case to be made here for derivation from the shroud, but I still don’t think the case holds water. You make the interesting comment that copying the facial hairstyle of a holy image is “splitting hairs.” This seems strange when artists are supposed to have studied the shroud in such detail as to copy minute imperfections of the weave as if they were essential parts of their reproductions.

I now have a copy of Paul Vignon’s 1903 book Le Linceul Du Christ, in which he makes no remarks at all about markings. He includes, however, several good reproductions of Pia’s photos, and the double crease simply isn’t there. It must have arrived as a consequence of the rolling up of the shroud between 1898 and the 1931 Enrie photography. As for the two strands of hair, they do not appear at all on the shroud, and I am not at all persuaded that they are representations of the epsilon blood drip ‘translated’ into hair. Three of the Vignon markings, which appear to exist on the shroud, are really only one, namely the open square, the shallow V inside it and the droopy V below it. The square is easily the most visible, but apart from the Roman catacomb painting (what was the shroud doing in Rome, one wonders?) most of the paintings which are claimed to have derived from the shroud seem to have omitted the square altogether in favour of the V markings. How odd. As for the nose and cheeks, there is, very properly, no sign of any bruising or battering on the Byzantine portraits. They nearly all show their subject turned slightly towards, and illuminated by, light from the right. Not only does this reduce the area of cheek visible on the right, but also means that there is a greater area of cheek, and more shadow, on the left. I do not feel this establishes that this asymmetry in the depiction of the nose and cheeks is derived from the shroud. As for the moustache and beard, it is obvious that the general shape of a Byzantine moustache looks nothing like that of the man in the shroud. His is quite bushy and bulges around the nostrils; theirs consists of two long straight diagonals with a little tuft in the middle. If anything, this style of moustache clearly shows that these portraits are not derived from the shroud. Byzantine depictions of beards, surely the most prominent and distinctive of features (I have a beard myself, dear reader) are split about 50/50 forked or pointed.

Maybe it’s the flowers thing all over again. OK lists the famous 15 marks, two of which, as I have clearly established, weren’t present on the Shroud at all. (To claim that just one of the three distinctive creases of the Enrie photo, as bright as the two big ones bracketing the face, was somehow omitted by Pia because of the lighting conditions is really not justified. And there is no reason to claim that all the blood trickles were somehow converted into two little wisps of hair). The point about the Vignon markings is that they appear on images and “cannot be artistically justified except with reference to the shroud.” And there’s no doubt that the Roman catacomb portrait does have a big meaningless square between the brows. It is, however, the only instance of that in all the images I have seen (It is not one of OK’s examples). All the others, and every instance of the supposed “forehead streak” and most of the “V”s, are perfectly reasonable deliniations of the supra orbital ridges and bulge of the forehead, and need owe nothing to any supposed imperfections on the shroud. A very few images, it is true, have well defined, and apparently meaningless well defined curvy lines, loops and triangles drawn across the brows, and these, I agree, need explaining, but they look nothing like the faint imperfections on the shroud. OK, like most “Vignon spotters” somewhat arbitrarily assigns these to “topless squares,” and the two supposed V’s within and below them. A single casual glance at the image on the shroud shows a roughly rectangular face with no visible ears, a bushy moustache and a short, stubby, split beard. Astonishingly, in spite of their alleged study of minute differences between single threads, not a single one of OK’s images can be so described. Even more surprising, perhaps, is the fact that Vignon’s own sketch (if so it be; it seems the most reproduced) of his markings looks nothing like the shroud face either!

The whole point about ghe Vignon markings, as I understand it, is that by making no artistic sense, they prove that they must have derived from some other tradition which the artist didn’t understand.

All faces have eyes and mouths, and any two full face portraits can be related so that these features coincide. The fact remains that the most obvious and easiest to copy features of the face on the Shroud are not reflected in any of the Byzantine portraits, with their ovoid faces, with narrowed chins or beards, droopy moustaches and visible ears.

As for the rest, I’m afraid we’ll simply have to differ. My own opinion is that the man on the Shroud looks very like most of the philosophers illustrated in Zankar’s book (which you link to elsewhere: http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?doc Id=ft3f59n8b0&brand=ucpress), and not much like the Byzantine icons often said to be derived from it. For the benefit of those who may be following this conversation without taking part, I ask them to compared the image of the Shroud with, say, the early Byzantine icon now at St Catherine’s monastery (http://www.graceiseverywhere.net/category/praise/, the entry for 3 Feb 2013 is an enlargeable version), and Figure 9 from Zankar. To me the Shroud is far more reminiscent of the Homeric ideal than it is of the droopy moustached Byzantine, and no doubt OK thinks the opposite. What do the rest of you feel?.","date":"2014-04-29","mins":"6:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/27/more-on-how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"More on How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"id":"comment-119300","author":"hugh_farey","post":"OK, you really ought to be consistent. A few days ago you dismissed my wide range of non Christ portraits carrying Vignon markings because, as they didn’t have shoulder length hair, they couldn’t possibly be derived from the Shroud. Now you seem to be a staunch defender of the Spanish Pantocrator, even though, as it has short hair, by your own repeated and insistent criteria, it cannot be derived from the Shroud, and therefore any Vignon markings it may posess are accidental! But that it would be unkind, one would feel like asking you the question you asked of Mo, wouldn’t one?.","date":"2014-05-14","mins":"12:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-121953","author":"hugh_farey","post":"The Shroud looks like pictures of Jesus because by the time it came to be made everybody knew what Jesus looked like. OR Pictures of Jesus look like the Shroud because the Shroud came first and was the model for the pictures. I don’t think it is as easy to discriminate between these two points of view as Yannick, Meacham or Philip Mc Nair claim. Pictures of John the Baptist or most of the apostles are also often easily recognisable. Jesus’s image is not as consistent as often quoted, and I wonder if the image above, as reproduced by Dan, would be as obvious as it is without its massive halo. Context is often as much a guide as physiognomy, which is how most of the less bearded Jesus’s are also instantly recognisable..","date":"2014-05-20","mins":"7:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/the-vignon-markings-issue-a-promoted-comment/","cat":"art","title":"The Vignon Markings Issue:  A Promoted Comment"},{"id":"comment-119382","author":"hugh_farey","post":"I applaud the determination of your defence, OK, but surely the watchers on the hillsides can see you’re fighting a losing battle. Every new example demonstrates the arbitrariness of the Vignon markings right across Byzantine portraiture. Almost every portrait, divine or secular, has three or four, and very few, if any, divine or secular, have nine or more. Most have something in between. A great many omit the glaringly obvious ones (long hair, divided beard) in favour of barely detectable irregularities (square and Vs), which seems perverse. Of course more Christs than non Christs can be adduced to demonstrate the markings, but that is because there are vastly more Christ than non Christ portraits over all. It’s no use coming up with all exceptions to the rule and then pleading for common sense, as my common sense clearly shows that the Vignon markings are a delusion..","date":"2014-05-14","mins":"3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-119438","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Arbitrary does not necessarily mean irrelevant, I agree, but in this case, as it is increasingly clear that none of the Vignon marks, singly or in any combination, are exclusive to portraits of Christ, I think they are irrelevant as a method of determining whether those portraits were derived from the Shroud..","date":"2014-05-14","mins":"5:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"id":"comment-119486","author":"hugh_farey","post":"Well I agree with that, of course..","date":"2014-05-14","mins":"6:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"}]
