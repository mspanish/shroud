[{"id":"comment-165069","author":"emma08","post":"It would be nice to see a counter article from someone of repute. Perhaps de wesselow. I think a number of us have problems with Charles’ article. But he has the “authority” of “historian” title behind him. Personally I don’t give this much weight, but many do. Having a Ph D and worked part time as an academic for a few years, I can attest to the fact that many of the so called “expert” academics I worked with were either “wrong” or very dogmatic (which often made them “Wrong”, at least in parts). Probably only 20% of the academics I have encountered have been truly open minded and relatively free of dogmatic positions. I am now very skeptical about the weight given to “Experts”. I strongly suspect that Charles’ skepticism with regard to the Shroud as influencing what he writes. Or else he is simply not looking at things from all angles in a balanced way (ie. See my comments on the other post about his comments on the “boldness” of artistic representations suggesting that the Shroud was originally much bolder) What frustrates me most about him is that he rarely acknowledges valid potential alternative theories..","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"1:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"}]
