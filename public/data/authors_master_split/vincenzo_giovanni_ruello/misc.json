The screen is tilted and the positive images appear in both cloths. This does not require even any scientific verification as it is self verifying, and there is no distortion. We can see the true face of Christ in the Shroud without reversal of left to right ,the Veronica because its small was photographed in close up once revealed and futher processed. Please show this to the prospective team as this is the foundation and evidence to the theory thanks. Please also understand I actually photographed the Veronica image and processed film revealing the same image on my website http://gloria.tv/?media=524164.","date":"2013-12-16","mins":"7:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/16/a-thread-dedicated-to-vincenzo-giovanni-ruellos-proposal/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Thread Dedicated to Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello’s Proposal"},{"id":"comment-60221","author":"vincenzo_giovanni_ruello","post":"What I have done in scientific terms is discover a form of infared filming where tilting the screen back filters out certain colours allowing us to see through the true images encoded in the Shroud and the Vatican Veronica. Infared cameras are programmed to filter or enhance colours allowing people to see in the dark or to examine paintings and the cosmos.

Pheiffer resoning that Manappello image miraculously appears on both sides is also ridiculous as if any artist paints on a silk it will be seen on both sides as silk and bysup is transparent. Unfortunately for Pheiffer he made his conclusions in the late 90s. My work and discovery on Vatican Veronica has debunked his theory. Once I set up my project team or some scientists decide to verify my findings, the Manoppello will be relegated to what it is a famous painting of unknown origen. The Guadalupe Mary if you study the history was created by an Aztec artist. It has survived 500 years because every few years it is painted over and over. There are only 2 miraculous cloths in existance, the Shroud and the Veronica Veil, The cloth of Olivedo in Spain is also authentic but does not have any encoded imagery.","date":"2013-12-16","mins":"12:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/what-if-there-is-a-breeze/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"What if there is a breeze?"}]
