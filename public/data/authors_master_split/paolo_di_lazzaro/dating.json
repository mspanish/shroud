[{"id":"comment-2304","author":"paolo_di_lazzaro","post":"It isn’t the first time that an Editor is co author of a paper submitted to its own journal. And usually the (formal) problem is easily solved by a blind review procedure. As an example, I faced a similar spot when I submitted two papers for publication in the Proceeding volume of IWSAI (International Workshop on the Scientific approach to the Acheiropoietos images). I was co author of two papers and at the same time editor of the Proceedings and responsible for the choice of the Referees. I solved this problem asking to a colleague to manage the review procedure: select the Referees, receive from each Referee the anonymous review, and send me the same reviews.
