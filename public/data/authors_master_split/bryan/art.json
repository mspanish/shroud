[{"id":"comment-15283","author":"bryan","post":"Amy, I would love to add your child to a prayer list that I have been putting together, as well as document his story for a project God has begun to have me work on with my brothers and sisters in christ. The project will ultimately be made into a website centered prayer ministry where people can request prayer and follow up when it is answered, as well as churches will be able to share prayer lists… but most importantly that people will be able to watch videos and read stories of the true accounts of God’s miracles… God hasn’t revealed the entire purpose yet to me, but I believe that alot of it has to do with breaking down the division between demoninations and unifying the Body of Christ and to show people that we serve a very real, very loving God of salvation not of condemnation, who hears us and wants us to speak with him, who wants us to hear the truth, our future and above all who wants to heal us. Please email me (anyone else who God has healed or revealed himself to please send me an email too) … the project is focussing on New England right now, but I believe that God will make a place for the stories from accross the country and world also…. You can go to my facebook @ (http://www.newcreation517.com – it redirects to facebook until I am done with the cd for my music ministry…) or email me at bryan@statusentgroup.com Thank you everyone to everyone who has shared their testimonies, I have truely felt blessed sitting here reading them all!!!! May HIS love prevail!
