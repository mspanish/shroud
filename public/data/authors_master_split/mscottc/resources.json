[{"id":"comment-83158","author":"mscottc","post":"Much agreed. Those who espouse methodological naturalism automatically rule out supernatural explanations with no real philosophical justification. No one has ever improved upon Hume’s flimsy argument against miracles which has long since been refuted. Nothing rules out an occurrence being uniquely unrepeatable, un testable and thus un falsifiable. But that is no argument against its occurrence, it is just something science has no apparatus to explain. The fact is, this is what we would expect if something fit the criteria for a miracle. I am not suggesting that natural explanations have been exhausted or should not be further explored. I am simply saying if everything else points to authenticity and the image cannot be explained naturally, it is time to allow the preponderance of evidence to suggest the image was the result of a supernatural occurrence; and that likely points to the well attested narratives chronicling eye witness accounts of Jesus’ resurrection..","date":"2014-02-27","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/26/giulio-fantis-book-launched/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti’s Book Launched"}]
