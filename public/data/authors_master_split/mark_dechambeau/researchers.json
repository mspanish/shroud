[{"id":"comment-48710","author":"mark_dechambeau","post":"Mr. Schwartz, About your decomposition test for the shroud of Turin: You used a dead pig, I would assume that was killed mercifully. After having to undergo numerous spinal operations and the pain attached, I know that there is a condition that I call “the pains sweats”. It would have me sitting on the steps in a T shirt at 30 C, feeling hot. It also smells. Perhaps if you were to try the decomposition test again with a coating of whatever chemicals Christ would have had on his body from “the pain sweats”, you would get even better results. Also to be considered are what they might to wash the body and the interaction of these chemicals with the pain sweats chemicals. I am sure that I don;t have to mention this but please don’t torture a pig to death for the sake of realism. Whether the shroud is real or a fake isn’t that important. What is important is that Christ died a horrid death for us. The church say he died to pay for our sins. I believe that .this babbling idiocy. The only explanation that makes sense to me is that he lived and died so that he could experience the human condition fully and be able to judge us fairly. Surely the greatest example of love there ever was. If you have the time, please respond and let me know if what I am saying is valid and if you decide to do the test and what your results were. Thank You.","date":"2013-10-25","mins":"10:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/01/30/barrie-schwartz-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwartz on the Shroud of Turin"}]
