[{"id":"comment-1570","author":"noya","post":"A truthful and scientific comment. Religion and Science move proving and reproving, each other. Science is an act of God, while Faith is the guided way of God to understand His Acts, the Science. Human mistakes in understanding faith, will lead to defective reproving in science. Similar is the case here. Certainly, Shroud is a fact, visible to everybody, if we fail to understand, how this picture was created, it is our defective faith or our defective science, which is standing in our way to solve the mystery. We should be bold enough in correcting our faith, and science will certainly come forward to prove it, that this is “picture of Real Jesus Christ, who never died on the cross”, all Biblical statements, about HIS appearances, after disappearance from the temporary sepulcher, are true facts. He, our beloved Jesus Christ was a true beloved Prophet of God. Scientists should give a serious thought, to what is claimed by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, India. He is the claimant of being Second Coming of Jesus Christ, in spirit. He claimed that our beloved Jesus Christ, lived a long life (to spread the message of God, to all tribes of Israelites), after fulfilling the prophesy of Bible, as per guidance given to him by God Himself. He further claimed that disciples of our Beloved Jesus Christ, prepared a special Ointment to cure fast the wounds of our Beloved Jesus Christ, which might have been applied on the whole body of our Beloved Christ. If after application, of this ointment, Our beloved Christ was wrapped in the Shroud Cloth, the evaporation of this Ointment, might have created this image on the shroud. All the references of this Ointment components are given in several books. The name of this ointment is also referred as “Marham Issa”, which means, an ointment specially made for Jesus Christ. These are Historical facts, which are being completely overlooked, due to our Faith only. Please set aside the Faith, for a moment and look into the historical facts, claimed by the claimant of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, in spirit. This may show us a new cavern with a lot of scientific light..","date":"2010-10-23","mins":"8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/10/22/intellectual-sifting-get-real-a-lesson-for-shroud-of-turin-studies/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Intellectual Sifting: Get Real – A Lesson for Shroud of Turin Studies"},{"id":"comment-1699","author":"noya","post":"Little knowledge and big statements by sons’ of Adam, is itself a proof that both scientists and theologians need more schooling of elementary theology and alphabet of scientific investigation..","date":"2010-11-17","mins":"5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/11/16/maybe-god-doesnt-know-the-future/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Maybe God Doesn’t Know the Future"},{"id":"comment-2811","author":"noya","post":"The summary of various ideologies, leads to a conclusion that hell is a place like hospital, where treatment is provided to all those souls who are suffering from some moral sickness.
