[{"id":"comment-59431","author":"dennis_goller","post":"Science knows ABSOLUTELY for sure that the blood was spilled on the cloth prior to the image appearing. There is NO WAY an artist could have spilled blood on the Shroud perfectly both Anatomically and Forensically speaking, AND THEN created an image around it. NO WAY. The image is only 2 MICROMETERS deep on the MICROFIBERS of the shroud. THERE IS NOTHING that science is aware of that could of done this. Please read up. Skepticism is perfectly normal, however you must realize what the Shroud IS NOT. Please people, if you want to know the FACTS research anything that BARRIE SCHWORTZ has written and visit http://www.theshroud.com. Scientific Fact. These findings on this site are legit and have stood before scientific peer review. These findings are not to persuade people. It is what it is, SCIENTIFIC FACT. Opinions only matter when you have armed yourself with the correct and factual information. Barrie was on the original STURP team that studied the shroud in 1978 and has committed his life, non profit, to the findings and research of the Turin Shroud. He is the leading spokesperson on the subject, period. If you go to youtube.com you can listen to an excellent non biased interview with him on Coast to Coast radio. An EXCELLENT interview that will answer many questions and remove many of the “what if’s”. Thank you, this wasn’t intended as an insult to anyone..","date":"2013-12-14","mins":"2:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly"}]
