I appreciate the thought you’ve put into your last post as well. I’m not sure what the rest of us will do now, I would urge you to consider allowing somebody to keep the website going, as the value of the commenting section is quite incredible – but I myself would be nowhere near qualified to moderate. I’d be happy to host the site though, as well as help preserve/and or convert the data if need be. I’ll contact you privately about that. God Bless you in all of your new endeavors – you will be greatly missed!.","date":"2015-12-17","mins":"12:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"}]
