[{"id":"comment-6188","author":"anteyetheist","post":"This is all ridiculous, you are all claiming that Jesus and Christianity is something real. Unlike “faith”, belief in something without evidence. Just think about it, If Christianity was real, that would mean all others are false. Try to tell a Muslim that Allah had a son!! That would mean that you just happened to pick the “right” religion, which in this case most of the people posting, it is the one your parents raised you… In perhaps the most Christian country in the world – The USA. Just ask yourself the question… If this kid came back and said that Vishnu told him that Hinduism was the way and Jesus is a false god, would you switch religions?? Exactly….
