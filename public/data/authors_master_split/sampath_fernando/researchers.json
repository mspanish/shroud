Believe in Jesus and do what ever thing he ask you to do to recieve the Eternal Life. Remember new commandment and practice it to receive the Eternal Life rather than just thinking “only faith can save you”.. You guys have been fooled by Paul and Martin Luthur. Jesus never says faith will save you. Even Peter says sometimes he can’t understand the things written by Paul. (read Bible) Jesus is a doer rather than warming the seat what church goers are doing. (read the Bible) Today mahjority of Christians think faith can save them rather than helping their neighbours. What fools they are. As I told you previously do research on Shroud and see that how real is it. Find out for yourself why Jesus left that image on his burial cloth. Rather than studying the image on the Shroud you are just condemning it. Why? Are you brain washed. Shroud is not a false prophet, it a piece of cloth showing how Jesus suffered for you and me. God Bless You.

As I mentioned few days ago Blood on Hair is the Trade Mark of Authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. This is the best evidence to prove that image was formed due to Radiation. No forger like painter or scorcher never place blood marks on hair. (I like B4.1 – Image) However I like the following: 589 711 AD in Spain – Peter ran to the tomb with John and saw the recent imprints of dead and risen One on the clothes.

However from the miracles Jesus performed including raising 3 people from dead, the fall through hypothesis is the most obvious answer to the Image on Turin Shroud. Yes body got dematerialised and some sort of radiation emitted during that process may be the cause for the image formation. Statements from the Gospels we know that Jesus had a body like Angel after the resurrection. Remember before his death Jesus told that at resurrection we get a body like an Angel..","date":"2015-10-27","mins":"8:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/26/dan-spicer-we-have-a-simple-explanation/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Dan Spicer:  We have a simple explanation."},{"id":"comment-214514","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Thank you very much Thomas. My opinion about Holy Bible is quite different. I think Holy Bible was given to Christians by Constantine as a political solution to satisfy various Christian groups existed at that time. As an example, to satisfy Jewish Christians compilers included Old Testament, although Moses plagiarised the Creation story, the Flood story and also the Ten Commandments from other nations. Also to satisfy Pauline Christians they included Epistles of Paul. Surprisingly those who compiled the Bible did not use any records of majority of other Apostles. They did not include anything about Thomas especially what he did in India and neighbouring countries of India. In addition they burnt many books inherited by other Christian groups. Jesus never mentioned anything about the creation story and/or the great flood. Only thing Jesus mentioned from the creation story is that at the beginning Father made man and woman and when they united they become one. Also Jesus told that no one knows the end but only the Father. Most of the Epistles written by Paul contradict the new commandment of Jesus and the two Great Commandments mentioned by Jesus. So as a follower of Jesus either Old Testament or Epistles give me no help to understand the Kingdom of God. (or the Kingdom of Love). Only four Gospels tell about the Kingdom of God and how can we enter into it. As a follower of Jesus (not as a Christian or fundamentalist Christian) I believe all stories of Jesus from 4 Gospels. I have to believe those stories because I believe that Jesus really resurrected from death. Although there are many sceptics, my wisdom always tells me that Shroud of Turin is authentic. So the Shroud of Turin is the main and first Gospel for me. From 1st April 2010, the day I was introduced to the Shroud, I believe that Jesus really existed, died on the cross and resurrected. So to believe other Gospels and its stories are not a problem for me..","date":"2015-11-11","mins":"6:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"The Process of Resurrection"},{"id":"comment-214408","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"I think resurrection of Jesus is a miracle and also a process. If it a miracle, then the body of Jesus should not change and it had to be the same bodies like Lazarus and the other two who were raised by Jesus from the dead. However unlike those three bodies, Jesus did not have the same body after the resurrection. According to Gospels Jesus acted differently after the resurrection. Jesus appeared and disappeared. What was the reason for that? So far no one has given an acceptable explanation how the image was formed. Then if Shroud of Turin is Authentic, then what was the reason for the image formation? If resurrection is a miracle then we may not get an image on the Shroud. So then some sort of process should have taken place during the resurrection..","date":"2015-11-08","mins":"5:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"The Process of Resurrection"},{"id":"comment-214448","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Dear Mr. Frias Moreira Thank you for your comments. Yes resurrection is a miracle. However unlike in other miracles, Jesus left us his battered image on his burial cloth for the future generations to believe. But unlike other miracles performed by Jesus, during the resurrection some sort of process had occured and this extra ordinary process created the image on the linen cloth. That is why no one can give a reasonable explaination about the formation of Negative Image. (during the first century or 14th century no one knew how to paint a negative image of a full size person or even did not have technology to uniformly scorch full image of a person) Image formation can not be explain by today’s scientific knowledge. So for any laymen resurrection image formation also a miracle.
