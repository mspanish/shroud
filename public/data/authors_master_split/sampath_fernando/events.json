[{"id":"comment-193541","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Dear Mr. Klotz I am agreeing with you regarding consciousness and quantum information of the universe. One of my Irish friend who was living in Canberra had a twin brother in Ireland. One day while he was practicing for church choir he got a feeling that his brother died. As soon as he went home after the practice he got a call from Ireland informing his brother died at the same moment he got that feeling. But unlike you I do believe in miracles and guardian angels as I have experience in that areas. Regarding image on the Shroud I agree with Mr. Barrie Schwortz. The image printed on the Shroud is a miracle and no one including Quantum mecahanics or Quantum Energy experts can explain the formation of that image.

Jesus resurrected and it is another miracle which I believe. According to history he is the only one got resurrected and no one knows how it happen. So it is very difficult for scientists explain that resurrection process. To do that scientists have to resurrect someone from the death. If they do so then they can find that process and can explain how the image on Shroud got printed. Yes some sort of external energy (quantum) may have involved in that process. (or may be some divine energy)..","date":"2015-03-16","mins":"6:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"id":"comment-215148","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Why these scientists are still defending the results of Carbon Dating and not the sampling procedure?

I am waiting to read more on his paper. Most probably this is the best hypothesis to explain the Glorified body according to Gospels. So far other hypothesises such as Painting, Scorch, Earth Quake Neutrons release, Corona Discharge etc. Have failed to explain properly, the formation of the image on the Shroud of Turin Thank you very much for the organisers of St. Louis Conference.
