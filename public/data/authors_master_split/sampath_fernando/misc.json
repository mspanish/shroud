Or they think believing in Jesus is more important than the things Jesus asked us to do to enter into the Kingdom of God. That is why there are more than 41, 000 denominations of Protestants. These Protestants compete with each other for power. That is why they carry the message of Grace. Yes Protestants sometimes reject the miracles performed by Jesus. On the other side of the story once St Mary’s Cathedral Sydney refused give me Holy Communion (or Eucharist) on 2014 Ash Wednesday. I was saddened by that event and stop calling myself as a Christian. Now I am only a follower of Jesus without any denomination.

Any chemical, biological or natural reaction of a dead or living body cannot make an image like that. I am quite sure that none of the biological or chemical processes can create an image like on the TS with the hair, beard and eyebrows. Dr. Accetta’s experiment confirmed that image was created by some sort of radiation. As confirmed by many scientists blood stains are real and blood soaked to the linen before the creation of the body. Most probably body dematerialized and some sort of radiation activity emerged within the body to create dorsal and frontal images and linen acted like a (photographic or X ray film).
