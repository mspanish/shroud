But for agnostics or atheists require some sort of evidence to accept the Shroud of Turin as a true burial cloth of Jesus. This may be the reason Jesus left his battered image on this burial cloth that he really lived on this earth and resurrected from the death..","date":"2015-10-24","mins":"4:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/24/and-now-you-have-something-to-do-this-weekend/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And now you have something to do this weekend"},{"id":"comment-216343","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Hi OK – Thank you for the posting.

As an Environmental Engineer I always go for Composite sampling, rather than Grab sampling, when I design water or wastewater treatment plants. Yes method of analysis is same for both type of samples but they give different results. Grab samples never give a true picture of the quality of water. Same way, as I believe, the results of Carbon test is not accurate, Scientists took a sample from only one corner of the shroud. They did not take a representative sample of the Shroud. I never think the results of that Carbon test as accurate. The sample they took may be a contaminated one. Why these intelligent scientists did not think, before publishing their results that their sample is a contaminated one. There is a high probability that their results are wrong. Their results are a very good tool for non believers to discard the authenticity of the Shroud.

The image on the Shroud of Turin is a negative image. I don’t think if we wrap a live body or dead body (whether traumatised or not) with a linen cloth we won’t get a negative image through any biological process or chemical process similar to the image on the Shroud of Turin. To get a negative image like on the Shroud of Turin, some sort of light, X ray or some sort of radiation type waves have to be involved and also the surface of the linen cloth has to act like photographic or X ray paper. According to Gospels only Jesus knew when he is going to die and resurrect. As such no one prepare a special linen cloth to wrap the body of Jesus. However Joseph of Arimathia found a brand new linen cloth to wrap the dead body of Jesus in hurry. However as a result of that we now got a miraculously printed image which was not painted as well as scorched..","date":"2015-06-10","mins":"6:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"id":"comment-201535","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Hugh – That the comparison is illusory is easily understood by considering the beard, and eyebrows of the image of the Shroud.
