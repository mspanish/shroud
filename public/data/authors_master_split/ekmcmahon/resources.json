There is an ancient record of one person who survived a crucifixion that was intended to be lethal, but that was interrupted. Josephus recounts: “I saw many captives crucified, and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died under the physician’s hands, while the third recovered.”[54] Josephus gives no details of the method or duration of the crucifixion of his three friends before their reprieve. These men were not speared in their side yet nor were their legs broken. Another thought is were the nailed onto their cross or just tied. Were they beaten as bad as Jesus was as per the Shroud indicates ?.","date":"2015-05-29","mins":"5:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?"},{"id":"comment-201259","author":"ekmcmahon","post":"Pilate was surprised that Jesus survived being stabbed in the side of his chest by a Roman soldier with his spear ??.","date":"2015-06-07","mins":"5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?"},{"id":"comment-195407","author":"ekmcmahon","post":"It is my belief that the image on the Shroud was “imaged” at the split second that the Devine Soul of Jesus’ Christ re entered his body for his Resurrection..","date":"2015-04-05","mins":"3:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"id":"comment-195408","author":"ekmcmahon","post":"I should make clear about what image I am speaking about, it is the one that some people say was made by some chemical or ‘scorching ‘ element..","date":"2015-04-05","mins":"3:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"id":"comment-213978","author":"ekmcmahon","post":"It would appear that the Shroud has the DNA on it of most every person who has handled it since it’s beginning.

I enjoyed it, though because I have been following the Shroud research close for the last few years I did not see anything new. I am one of those that is referred to as a believer. I believe that the Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ from which he resurrected through. Another way of thinking is that one moment, his dead physical human body was laying within the Shroud (laying on the bottom half with the top half placed and wrapped over the body and when his Divine soul re entered his body, the body dissolved and was reconstituted outside of the wrapping. His Divine body and soul were free of the Shroud and was free to move about in the physical world as we know it. His new God given combined Body and Soul were able to appear and disappear at his will. This was the remainder of his earthly life until his Ascension 40 days later..","date":"2015-06-21","mins":"5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/21/promotion-for-the-holy-winding-sheet-exploring-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"television","title":"Promotion for The Holy Winding Sheet: Exploring the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-212884","author":"ekmcmahon","post":"Thank You !.","date":"2015-10-18","mins":"4:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/18/raymond-arroyos-special-report-from-april/","cat":"video","title":"Raymond Arroyo’s Special Report from April"},{"id":"comment-202749","author":"ekmcmahon","post":"Hi, I use AT&T and am in the PST and I cannot see that program listed during any time frame ??.","date":"2015-06-19","mins":"3:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/set-your-dvrs/","cat":"television","title":"Set Your DVRs"},{"id":"comment-60427","author":"ekmcmahon","post":"I am looking forward to this program..","date":"2013-12-16","mins":"2:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/16/the-mysteries-of-the-holy-sepulcher-documentary/","cat":"video","title":"The Mysteries of the Holy Sepulcher Documentary"}]
