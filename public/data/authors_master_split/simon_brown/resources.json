It was also very good to meet you at the Jalsa Salana conference and get to know you. I will also add on my channel your interview I took of you explaining your views on the Shroud. My editor has checked the spelling mistakes out, and said some are not mistakes but are correct and has now rectified the wrong one, thanks. Please don’t let the errors put you of, I always make mistakes, like most people, and people like you always let me know about them, which I always then rectify. And the many mistakes which was on my first Shroud booklet which has been no 1 on Amazon for over 2 years is a good example and proves errors make no difference, after they have been rectified. As I said, I will send you a free copy to let me know of any more, which I doubt you will find as the majority of the book are articles and research by other Shroud experts.

Raymond Rogers From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Raymond N. Rogers (1927–2005) was an American chemist who was considered a leading expert in thermal analysis. To the general public, however, he was best known for his work on the Shroud of Turin. Biography Rogers was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. At the University of Arizona he studied chemistry receiving a BS in 1950. From 1951 to 1988 he was an explosives research expert and thermal analyst with the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (later called Los Alamos National Laboratory or LANL). From 1987 until 1992 he served on the Department of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board with the equivalent rank of ‘Lt. General’ and received a Distinguished Service Award. He received other awards and recognitions from LANL and many professional organizations. He was granted a sabbatical in 1968 to pursue post graduate studies in archaeology. During his career Rogers published over forty peer reviewed papers on chemistry. In 1981 he was named Laboratory Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Other honors included being named a Tour Speaker for the American Chemical Society in 1971, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Distinguished Performance Award in 1984 and the Department of the Air Force Exceptional Civilian Service Medal in 1991. He also served as the editor for Energetic Materials, a peer reviewed scientific journal from 1983 1988. He was also on the editorial board of Thermochimica Acta from the first issue of this journal in 1970 (also the very first paper published in the first issue of this journal is authored by him) until his retirement in 1988.

There are lots of validations confirming the gospels outside the Bible and well. Here is one of many I wrote about. Is this the earliest validation confirming the gospels outside the Bible, By Thallus the (historian) Did you know there are ancient writings believed to be traced back before any of the gospels were written and dated, 50 – 52 AD, and later told by Thallus, an early historian which some Christians believe to be non Christian validation confirming what happened at the crucifixion of Jesus, and the darkness over the whole land and an earthquake, the rending of rocks, just as we are told happen in the gospels. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. Mark 15:34 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. Matthew 27:45 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent. Matthew 27:51 Early Christian use of Thallus The 9th century Christian chronologer George Syncellus cites Sextus Julius Africanus as writing in reference to the darkness mentioned in the synoptic gospels as occurring at the death of Jesus: Ref: From Wikipedia, “Julius Africanus – Extant Writings, Fragment XVIII”. “On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his ‘History’, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun.” Africanus then goes on to point out that an eclipse cannot occur at Passover when the moon is full and therefore diametrically opposite the Sun. Ref: From Wikipedia, Voorst, Robert E. Van (2000). Jesus Outside the New Testament : An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence. Eerdmans. Pp. 20 23. ISBN 0802843689. Eusebius (fourth century) mentions a history of Thallus in three books that according to an Armenian translation of Eusebius ranged from the sack of Troy to the 167th Olympiad. Some have argued that the reason Africanus doubted the eclipse is because Easter happens near the full moon and a solar eclipse would have been impossible at that time, as was well known. Compounding the matter is the Armenian translation of Eusebius has many corrupt numerals and so many apologists claim that 167th Olympiad (or 109 BCE) should really be 217th Olympiad. Ref: From Wikipedia, http://rbedrosian.com/euseb14.htm Jump up ^ Mosshammer, Alden E., The Chronicle of Eusebius and Greek Chronographic Tradition Bucknell University Press (Lewisburg, PA: 1979). Dr Craig, in his article: Thallus on the Darkness at Noon states: Here is the passage from Africanus reproduced by Syncellus: On the whole world there pressed a most fearful darkness; and the rocks were rent by an earthquake, and many places in Judea and other districts were thrown down. This darkness Thallus in the third book of his History , calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the Passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the Passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun. And it cannot happen at any other time but in the interval between the first day of the new moon and the last of the old, that is, at their junction: how then should an eclipse be supposed to happen when the moon is almost diametrically opposite the sun? Let that opinion pass however; let it carry the majority with it; and let this portent of the world be deemed an eclipse of the sun, like others a portent only to the eye. Phlegon records that, in the time of Tiberius Caesar, at full moon, there was a full eclipse of the sun from the sixth hour to the ninth manifestly that one of which we speak. But what has an eclipse in common with an earthquake, the rending of rocks, and the resurrection of the dead, and so great a perturbation throughout the universe? Surely no such event as this is recorded for a long period. But it was a darkness induced by God, because the Lord happened then to suffer. Ref: Reasonable Faith. Please see link below to the main article. Thallus (historian) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Thallus ( Greek : Θαλλός ) was an early historian who wrote in Koine Greek. He wrote a three volume history of the Mediterranean world from before the Trojan War to the 167th Olympiad, c. 112 109 BC. Most of his work, like the vast majority of ancient literature, has been lost, although some of his writings were quoted by Sextus Julius Africanus in his History of the World. The works are considered important by some Christians because they believe them to confirm the historicity of Jesus and provide non Christian validation of the Gospel accounts: a reference to a historical eclipse, attributed to Thallus, has been taken as a mention of the worldwide darkness described in the Synoptic gospels account of the death of Jesus, although an eclipse could not have taken place during Passover when this took place.
