[{"id":"comment-8859","author":"randy","post":"One thing that Tabor does not seem inclined to mention is that the “Jesus” ossuary from the Talpiot tomb is essentially empty. One of the authors of the original Talpiot story, Charles Pellegrino recently stated the following in a blog response: “Almost two years ago, Simcha told me that another lab had independently come to conclusions consistent with my survey of trace fiber evidence from the Talpiot tomb’s Jesus Ossuary. The fibers are inconsistent with a primary burial. Only a single hemispherical bone fragment, consistent with a carpal, appears ever to have been placed in the ossuary, with two cloths of unusual composition. In any case, he’s not there, in the ossuary.” Is it possible that the Shroud may have been stored in an ossuary in some Jerusalem tomb (maybe not at the original burial site) for a period of time (possibly centuries) after the Resurrection? Given that this is an object related to a Jewish burial, I assume that the disciples would have been mystified by it and might default to how the burial remains would’ve been handled. In any event, I can’t see how it would’ve been handled casually..","date":"2012-03-01","mins":"10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/fasten-your-seatbelt-more-archeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Fasten your seatbelt: More Archeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"}]
