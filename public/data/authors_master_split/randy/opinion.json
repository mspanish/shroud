[{"id":"comment-9522","author":"randy","post":"Dan, I’m sure you are recognizing this and are concerned, but Colin has effectively taken over your blog. I like to come here daily to understand what’s new in regard to the Shroud and to monitor the debates, but I think Colin made his point a couple months ago. I believe most of the readers understand his theory by now. But he continues to hammer his points in an attempt to convince everyone that he has come up with a breakthrough that has been missed by all the researchers over the past 40 years. Even if the Shroud was an artist’s work (which I don’t believe for an instant), to execute his theory of a scorch created by a hot statue seems like a ton of work, and that simpler methods that Mc Crone (painting) and Nickell (rubbings) have described seem more reasonable and could be as effective in “fooling” those medieval believers. I know Colin isn’t concerned about “arts and crafts”, but it seems unrealistic to not consider that as a major factor in proving the theory. I can imagine how many ruined linen cloths there would be for the artist before they got it right (if they ever would) under his theory. And while you might apply the blood first before you did the the hot statue, the flows that we see on the Shroud seem very realistic and must come from a real body. For example, why would the hot statue artist even consider creating the flow of blood from the wound in the side that trickles over to the back of the image, especially if the dorsal image was done at a different time. Until Colin actually recreates the Shroud image (or a portion thereof) and determines that it is consistent with all the chemical and physical properties that have been published, I am not particularly interested in hearing more about his theory. Thanks for your well done and compelling blog..","date":"2012-03-22","mins":"4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/22/the-secrets-of-mfol-revealed/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The secrets of MFOL revealed"},{"id":"comment-9544","author":"randy","post":"Colin, And maybe what I’m saying is that Dan should not report on your blog anymore until you have done much more intensive work on proving your theory. Then I’m sure all of us would be very interested in understanding how you were able to come up with your breakthrough. I would guess you could author a book explaining how you successfully debunked the Shroud. That might be a good investment of time for a retired Sciencebod. The only reasonable way for the artist to determine what the blood flows would look like as a result of a wound to the side is to actually see it happen to a human body. Now we have a highly skilled metal sculptor, who knows how to scorch linen with his work to create a superficial image, and is also expert on blood flows and how to make those appear natural on a linen cloth by using his statue to apply before the scorching exercise. This is the “arts and crafts” aspect that doesn’t seem to support your theory. Remember too that the Shroud first appeared in a small French church, under ownership of a Knights Templar. If this was forged, I still can’t see why someone would go thru this much trouble to “fool” the pilgrims..","date":"2012-03-23","mins":"12:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/22/the-secrets-of-mfol-revealed/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The secrets of MFOL revealed"}]
