[{"id":"comment-4312","author":"joanne_nirtaut","post":"There is no doubt in my mind that Jesus was left handed. This is because I have always strongly felt the physical presence of Jesus each time I received Eucharist. He always wraps his LEFT arm tightly around my shoulder after weekly Communion at Mass. I had always felt Jesus’ physical presence within and beside me since I received my First Communion at age 7. I don’t know of other Catholics who have this experience after receiving Eucharist. I’m 64 and a devout Catholic. I feel I’m truly blessed in Jesus revealing one of His very personal traits to me since my childhood.
