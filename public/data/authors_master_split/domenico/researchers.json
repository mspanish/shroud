Supposing that Mr Lombatti was talking about the historical field and not the scientific field he can not dismiss Emmaunell Poulle’s article “Les sources de l’histoire du linceul de Turin.

If, as Lombatti claims, ”the shroud was most likely given to French knight Geoffroy de Charny as a memento from a crusade to Smyrna” and if the Shroud “appears to have originated in Turkey” this means that the D’Arcis memorandum (where the Shroud is said made in France by an artist who lived there and procured by the Dean of the Lirey Collegiate for gain) loses any historical value. So, Mr. Lombatti with his peer review article completely dismisses the D\\’arcis memorandum and backs the Shroud in the East. The question is: what Geoffroy de Charny received ? something done then or something that was over there long time?.","date":"2012-06-12","mins":"8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-4633","author":"domenico","post":"I think this is Fanti’s answer: http://www.dim.unipd.it/fanti/diffusion.pdf.","date":"2011-11-07","mins":"6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/04/a-guest-posting-by-giulio-fanti/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by Giulio Fanti"},{"id":"comment-4627","author":"domenico","post":"But if these ‘forces of nature’ occurred only once in history to form an image in a cloth (as we do not know other cloths with a same image) we should ask why this happened….","date":"2011-11-07","mins":"3:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/04/a-guest-posting-by-giulio-fanti/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by Giulio Fanti"},{"id":"comment-6244","author":"domenico","post":"“bishop’s report of the forger’s confession”? first: a report without the name of the forger: very strange indeed! second: the bishop who reports the confession was not the bishop who listened the ‘forger’: very strange indeed!.","date":"2011-12-29","mins":"3:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/28/put-another-nickell-in-in-the-nickelodeon-2/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Put another Nickell in . . .
