In the second case (III/2) … a number of carbonized seeds (barley = hordeum perlatum) were found among the bones).” As we can read Haas is very accurate non only in the identification of the seeds but in to specify why only these ossuaries had preserved the flowers, the plants and the seeds. Mr. Zias, if you do not mind, I can not think that Haas was unable to recognize a flower from a root (he specifies that it was all ‘well preserved’) and to recognize the presence of infiltrating roots in stone ossuaries (there were visible cracks in the case of infiltration). I can not think about infiltrating roots that could wrap only the long bones but not the skulls which where at the top of the ossuary too and in any case the bundles of cereal spikes and the carbonized seeds of barley did not arrive there by infiltration..","date":"2014-10-02","mins":"5:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-159752","author":"domenico","post":"On behalf of Mr. Zias: 1) Kokhim/loculi and burial chambers were carved into the rock. To write about “decayed roots from plants/ trees which had infiltrated from above the tomb” does not make sense as there are no infiltrated roots in those chambers. It suffices to search google image for ‘Kokhim’ to realize that it is impossible any infiltration of roots ‘from above the tomb’. 2) Vassilios Tzaferis confirms in his report published on BAR that “One ossuary also held a bouquet of withered flowers.” Was he mistaken too?.","date":"2014-10-06","mins":"4:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-160611","author":"domenico","post":"Zias: “There is some evidence in but a few ossuaries that some liquid was poured over the bones, but no one ever tried to find which.” Few ossuaries. Really? Let’s read Haas’ article. “Fifteen limestone ossuaries were found… In the 13 completely filled ossuaries, considerable moisture was found, bringing about a peculiar kind of preservation of the packed bones… A syrupy fluid was found filling the lower third of 13 ossuaries. The bones and other material immersed in this fluid were coated with a limy sediment. On the surface of some bones dark brown blotches were occasionally observed, or even a thick, adherent black brown crust.” Do you really call 13 of 15 ‘few’? p.s.
