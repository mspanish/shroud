[{"author":"domenico","post":"Mr. Jones,prof. Danin quotes in his last book prof. Litt sayng: \"I cannot make a precise identification of the pollen at the genus level, even less at the species level. However, with a high level of probablility, I can exclude that the pollen I have seen from the sticky tapes belong to Gundelia.\".but from your post I understand that prof. Litt made indeed an indentification at the genus level (cardus) even if he has previously said it was not possible..So, prof. Litt has changed his mind?.","date":"2010-08-13","mins":"4:12 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2008/11/did-max-frei-misidentify-carduus.html","title":"\nDid Max Frei misidentify Carduus argentatus Shroud pollen as Gundelia tournefortii?\n"}]
