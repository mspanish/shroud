[{"id":"comment-101685","author":"ali_eleam","post":"Dr. Phillips, I appreciate your work and hope to hear more about it in the future. In the 70’s I saw a mock up of the man whose image is on the shroud. The art piece was standing to the side of the entrance to the Chapel at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. I stood next to it and felt as though this was a true human form in perfect dimensions. I’ve been curious ever since. I want to believe it is real, but also being a scientist (Regis University a Jesuit school), I need that proof to substantiate my belief. I do have a question of you that I’ve never seen discussed probably because it might seem indelicate to the general public. My question is what is on the back side of the cloth? All we ever see in photos are the front view but I know the 14′ length of cloth was used with the body laying on it then folded up and over the front. My thoughts are that the backside should reveal pooling of blood and other materials as the man was dying and after he had died. Is this the case? Do these findings further substantiate the validity of the cloth? Did the shroud fold over the man’s feet or the man’s head? Why is only 1/2 of the cloth ever discussed? I guess I had more than one question, ha! Thanks for your time, Ali.","date":"2014-04-20","mins":"12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/20/wayne-phillips-hopes-to-create-a-small-shroud-army/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Wayne Phillips:  Hopes to create a small “Shroud Army”"}]
