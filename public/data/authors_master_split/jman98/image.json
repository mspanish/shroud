[{"id":"comment-9688","author":"jman98","post":"Hi Colin are you aware of a recent scientific article released around June 30th showing new research on samples obtained from the shroud? It was revealed that blood was found from these samples and they reveal chemical coumpounds that are released into the blood stream during a traumatic injury on the body. Im skeptical of course as too how prevelant these chemical conpounds really are in the blood stream. Also if real human blood is found how would that play into the hoax or creation of the shroud? Did the creator cut his own hand lol! Seems as though you are greatly educated on the subject and the only skeptic who is consistently doing research into the subject. Thanks for your great work I plan to continue to read through it and learn more about this subject. Heres the original research paper: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180487. Just wanted to know your thoughts, thanks!.","date":"2017-07-14","mins":"3:56 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/comment-promoted-what-are-we-to-make-of-the-second-face-on-the-reverse-side-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Comment promoted: what are we to make of the second face on the reverse side of the Turin Shroud?"}]
