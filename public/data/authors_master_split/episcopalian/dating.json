But even so, this is a literal reading of scripture which cannot be deemed scientific. I am a true believer but I don’t take scripture literally in the sense that it is a scientific description or a historical narrative that conforms to modern objective historical standards or even journalistic standards. Thanks for you opinion. We can both be true believers and still disagree on particulars..","date":"2009-12-31","mins":"8:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/11/23/the-mummy-at-the-georges-labit-museum-in-toulouse/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Mummy at the Georges Labit Museum in Toulouse"},{"id":"comment-6606","author":"episcopalian","post":"Max, that doesn’t make any sense.

Am I not correct in assuming that even on the other side of the sample, the twill (2 or 3 hop) would be obvious. There have been suggestions that Jull confused warp and weft. But even so, Jull’s thread count is high. Thanks for that data. I had some of it but you have rounded it out nicely..","date":"2011-01-06","mins":"7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/05/was-the-sample-used-in-the-jull-paper-not-from-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Was the sample used in the Jull paper NOT from the Shroud of Turin?"}]
