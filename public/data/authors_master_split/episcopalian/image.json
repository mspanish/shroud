And blood still under pressure from the previously beating heart is sometimes released in spurts. Don’t depend too much on television CSI; those are general statements. As for the scientist in the previous History Channel special, you are referring to Walter Mc Crone. His “proof” was visual observation through a microscope. In fact, Mark Anderson, who worked for him disagreed and ran Raman Spectrometry on Mc Crone’s samples. What Mc Crone saw was organic and thus could not be red ochre. Later tests at the Nebraska University center for Spectrometry proved also that there was no red ochre in the samples. BTW, it is a very ancient pigment and a very modern pigment. The correct statement is that it is a pigment used throughout history and known in medieval times..","date":"2010-05-09","mins":"6:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/09/30/inexplicable-3d-optical-illusion-phenomenon/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Inexplicable 3D Optical Illusion Phenomenon"},{"id":"comment-1251","author":"episcopalian","post":"You are completely right.

I don’t believe it and I don’t know how quantum entanglement has anything to do with radionics. Here is a description from Wikipedia: Radionics devices contradict principles of biology and physics, and no scientifically plausible mechanism of function is posited. In this sense, they can be described as magical in operation. No plausible biophysical basis for the “putative energy fields” has been proposed, and neither the fields themselves nor their purported therapeutic effects have been convincingly demonstrated.[7] No radionic device has been found efficacious in the diagnosis or treatment of any disease, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not recognize any legitimate medical uses of any such device.[2] According to David Helwig in The Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine, “most physicians dismiss radionics as quackery.”[3].","date":"2011-01-23","mins":"11:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/23/humorous-comment-of-the-day-on-quantum-entanglement/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Humorous Comment of the Day on Quantum Entanglement"},{"id":"comment-2274","author":"episcopalian","post":"Look, I knew Sue Benford. I know Joe, her husband of many years. He is a personal friend. What they achieved in the carbon dating arena is tremendous and wonderful. But it doesn’t follow, therefore that Sue was right about “Empirical Evidence Supporting Macro Scale Quantum Holography in Non Local Effects.” I talked with her about it in Dallas in 2005. I didn’t accept it then and I don’t accept it now. I don’t really believe that the Journal of Theoretics is truly a scientific journal. (It has suspended publication). I have here on my bookcase books with proofs that Jesus survived crucifixion and went on the live in India, that Jesus moved to France, that Jesus didn’t exist, that the Loch Ness monster lives (wow is he getting old, St. Columba saw him some fifteen hundred years ago, UF Os have landed, etc. All come with glowing testaments and so called proofs and names of “experts” and so forth. The Shroud of Turin would be like these things were it not for some real, solid science published in real scientific journals.
