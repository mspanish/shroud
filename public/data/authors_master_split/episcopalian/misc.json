Is there no understanding that belief about is not the same as belief in. ‘I don’t believe there is a Loch Ness monster’ is a belief about a monster, perhaps mythological or imagined. It is not a belief in Nessie. The same is true with regards to belief in or about God. I might not believe in God or any gods and that is a belief about God or gods, mythological perhaps, even imagined (the old imaginary friend problem). It is still a belief and it is silliness to think otherwise by thinking that bald might be thought of as a color by silly people. I fell out of my crib when I heard that one. How many times must it be repeated in absence of logical arguments. The point was that, like Richard Dawkins, but very much unlike Michael Ruse, Jerry Coyne or Christopher Hitchens who are open minded Atheists, PZ Myers is a my mind is made up Fundy..","date":"2010-11-23","mins":"2:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/11/23/pz-myers-is-a-fundy/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"PZ Myers is a Fundy"},{"id":"comment-1187","author":"episcopalian","post":"“We have shown the shroud to be a fake,” Teddy Hall, the director of Oxford’s Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art said following carbon dating of the Shroud of Turin in 1988. “Anyone who disagrees with us ought to belong to the Flat Earth Society.” Barry, that should have been the end of it. The big piece of cloth with two life size images, front and back, of an apparently crucified man was not—could not be—the burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. Science had just proven that. It originated, so the scientists said, in the Middle Ages sometime between 1260 and 1390, or thereabouts. Two decades later, people are still trying to prove the Shroud is fake. And we should wonder why. One reason is that the carbon dating has been shown to be invalid. Ray Rogers, who had accepted the carbon dating, decided to disprove a crazy explanation from what he called the lunatic fringe. The crazy idea was that the Shroud had been mended and the samples were from that mending job. What Rogers discovered was that the crazy idea seemed to be right. He concluded that the sample used for carbon dating was not representative of the cloth. It was chemically different. Moreover, one of the chemical differences, the amount of vanillin, provided a new clue about the cloth’s age. Samples from the main part of the cloth, unlike the carbon 14 sample area, did not contain any vanillin. If the shroud was only as old as the radiocarbon date, it would have plentiful vanillin. The Shroud was at least twice as old. It might be 2000 years old. After a lengthy peer review process, his findings that the carbon dating was wholly invalid were published in the scientific journal Thermochimica Acta. This was also confirmed by John L Brown, a forensic materials specialist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia and by Robert Villarreal and a team of nine scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Additional articles appeared including one in Chemistry Today that showed that the sample used was completely invalid. One of the claims by proponents of authenticity is that even with modern technology, no one has been able to reproduce the images. British physicist Philip Ball repeated pointed this out in Nature. While true, it doesn’t mean that someone won’t figure it out, someday. But that is not all. Several historians argue, I think correctly, that history strongly suggests authenticity. The arguments are about as good as most ancient history gets. Even so, definitive proof is elusive. Case closed is simply not the case. Also, you should be aware that many true believers, primarily fundamentalist Christians, DO NOT WANT the Shroud to be real..","date":"2010-03-27","mins":"10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/shroud-of-turin-shows-another-mystery-face/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Shroud of Turin shows another mystery face"},{"id":"comment-1189","author":"episcopalian","post":"Barry, I don’t mind that you are an Atheist.

I rather think that if you spoke with an Episcopal priest, a Catholic priest, or most clergy persons in mainline Protestant churches, they would have no problem with your timeline. The Bible is not a science book or a history book. Of course there were dinosaurs. Evolution took place over millions of years. The Bible is metaphorical in the sense that you are trying to argue that we Christians believe it in a literal sense. No we don’t. I’m glad you can distinguish between history and hokum. I think we probably agree on all the details. Even so, I believe in God. Barry, who are you reading? Could we discuss where you are getting your philosophical insights?.","date":"2010-03-28","mins":"7:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/shroud-of-turin-shows-another-mystery-face/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Shroud of Turin shows another mystery face"},{"id":"comment-1249","author":"episcopalian","post":"I have an ancient vase that dates to about 500 B.C. If I were to reproduce it using materials and techniques that were available in the Middle Ages, would that prove definitively that it was a fake? The work of the scientist, Luigi Garlaschelli, a professor of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia in Italy, created an image that looked very much like the Shroud. It was a body rubbing and bas relief rubbing of a face mask with a pigment laced with acid. The acid etched an image onto the cloth’s fibers that was noticeable after the pigment was washed away. It was ingenious. And while it created an image that looked something like the images on the Shroud, it failed to recreate essential characteristics of the images. The images have not yet been really reproduced..","date":"2010-04-11","mins":"11:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/04/03/what-is-bigger-the-shroud-showing-in-turin-or-the-history-channel-in-the-us/","cat":"2010","title":"What is bigger: The Shroud showing in Turin or the History Channel in the US?"}]
