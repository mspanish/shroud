Hoare’s suggestion that the cloth was intended for clothing is, of course, a possibility. And then we have John and Rebecca Jackson suggesting that it was a tablecloth, and not just any tablecloth, mind you, but the tablecloth used at the last supper. And then, too, we have John Lupia suggesting it was a Jewish tallit. One thing that challenges but doesn’t disprove these speculations is the side strip. It seems apparent that the cloth’s loom width was reduced by cutting it near one edge and reattaching the selvedge. Linen was used for many purposes. We have references to linen curtains in the temple and it quite plausible that drapery was used in homes, particularly the homes of those who could afford such luxury. And we can certainly suspect that linen may have been also used as bed cloths. Stephen, your point about having to obtain the cloth in a hurry is well taken. It could have been a piece of linen from the marketplace intended for any purpose. Indeed, as clothing, it may have been a himation, which is what John of Damascus called it several centuries later. But it could also have been, as I speculated, an upscale burial shroud given that there were other upscale qualities to some of the tombs and ossuaries..","date":"2010-02-03","mins":"8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/02/02/the-gibson-study-really-says-nothing-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"The Gibson Study Really Says Nothing About the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-1424","author":"episcopalian","post":"Good point.
