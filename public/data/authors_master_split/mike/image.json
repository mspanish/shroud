[{"id":"comment-208318","author":"mike","post":"UV from a nearby flash would just radiate on the outside of any close objects I guess. UV is light. How could it penetrate and affect the shroud the way it is? Strong UV light may only be produced by the most energetic phase of lightning called the return stroke (20 30 kiloamperes on average) , ,so to have a possible interaction with the shroud, a direct strike should be needed. A direct return stroke would have produced considerable damage to the shroud as well as to the corpse. As far as I know this is not the case. Prior to lightning strike, corona discharges may take place on nearby objects. This indeed could possibly radiate from the body, if the shroud is rather dry. No direct strike is required for that. But, such a strong corona effect is usually produced in open air, in the immediate vicinity of the stroke. When the shroud image was produced, rigor mortis seems to imply that the body had been in the tomb for several hours. In such a place, no lightning strike could occur, no lightning induced corona discharge could be expected.
