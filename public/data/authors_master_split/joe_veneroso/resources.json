[{"id":"comment-39518","author":"joe_veneroso","post":"Dear Dan, I was eagerly awaiting your reaction to the entire book and am relieved and grateful you found it enjoyable. I am happy to report many readers, some who have left the church and others who had no interest in religious, found it “disturbing and inspiring”. Interesting combination! The underlying question posed by The Chimera is: can we accept truth from someone different than we are? My ultimate goal is to get people to think about the Incarnation in a new light and to take humanity seriously, because God does. All the best, Joe Veneroso.","date":"2013-07-22","mins":"9:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/22/dateline-united-states-july-22-2013-another-press-release-for-the-chimera/","cat":"books","title":"Dateline:  United States, July 22, 2013.

When my novel was first started (1993) controversy raged over various aspects of the Shroud. I used these as a springboard into MY FICTION (not the Shroud’s), creating a mystery thriller with totally made up characters and events.

All of my characters are fictitious products of my overactive imagination. Some are composites; others archetypes or caricatures. Dr. Linda Gramm, mother of protagonist Jeannette Gramm, represents the second largest “denomination” in the United States: “ex (as in exiled) Catholics.” She and her daughter represent the “chimera combination” of scientific yet spiritual. Her marital status is all too typical of many who no longer feel at home in the church. All the scientists in my novel are likewise fictitious. Beyond that, no, I don’t know where you were going! Care to elaborate?

Shameless Self Promotion Alert!)”The Chimera” http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1483630196/ref=mp s a 1 1?qid=1380279381&sr=8 1&pi=AC SX110 SY165 I guess by O’Reilly’s standards God told me to reply to your blog. Unlike aforementioned novel (in which the Shroud plays a crucial role) O’Reilly claims his book is factual. (Hell, it’s not even scriptural!) The gospels agree (a rarity to be sure) that the women went to the tomb PRECISELY to anoint the body, carrying with them the spices and myrrh. And if, according to some non existent Jewish tradition of visiting the tomb “on the third day” which God must have vouched safe to O’Reilly alone, other problems arise. The gospel account of Lazarus in John’s gospel clearly states he had been in the tomb “four days” and the women protest Jesus’ request to role away the stone. But more germane, it is that very phrase “on the third day” that has caused fundamentalists and scripture scholars alike such àgita, nigh these 2,000 years. Calendar days from Friday to Sunday might allow the names of three days, but by Jewish counting from sunset, Jesus had been in the tomb barely a day and a half. Thirty six hours max. The women went to the tomb WITH SPICES because the onset of the Sabbath on Friday evening precluded them from preparing the body of Jesus for burial properly. At sunrise Sunday they went, and the rest is history, although not apparently the one O’Reilly researched..","date":"2013-09-27","mins":"7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/27/the-gospel-according-to-bill-oreilly/","cat":"books","title":"The Gospel According to Bill O’Reilly"}]
