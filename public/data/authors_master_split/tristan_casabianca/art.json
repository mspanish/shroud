Both the large ‘linen cloth’ impinging on the symbols of the Evangelists in the lower corners and disrupting the balance of the composition, and the second border, seem to indicate that the figure of Christ was not part of the initial design. The iconographic theme is the symbolic representation of the sacrificial Lamb, surrounded by angelic hosts and the symbols of the Evangelists. The symmetrical composition, with the horizontal shroud (in some examples the sepulchre), the two angel deacons with their liturgical fans venerating behind, the symbols of the Evangelists in the corners, and the ornamental motifs on the ground and the inner border recur in a series of fourteenth century epitaphioi studied by Millet. A variation of the spiral motif decorating the arcs in the corners appears on the collar of a sakkos in the Vatican (14th c.) and on the epigonation of Metropolitan Anthimos in the Tismana Monastery (1370): these comparanda may indicate the approximate date of the earlier epitaphios. For the later work, comparisons may be made with the epitaphios of Metropolitan Makarios of Moldavia Wallachia (1428) and those in the Meteora Monastery and in the Church of St Nicholas Radaut (today the Museum of Sucevita), although an even more recent ‘renovation’ based on older models cannot be excluded.”.","date":"2014-06-28","mins":"9:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/28/comment-promoted-the-stavronikita-epitaphios/","cat":"art","title":"Comment Promoted:  The Stavronikita Epitaphios"},{"id":"comment-132338","author":"tristan_casabianca","post":"Here is the point of view of french medievist Emmanuel Poulle on the Pray Codex and the Turin Shroud (“Les sources de l’histoire du linceul : revue critique”, Revue d’histoire ecclésiastique, 2009, p. 773). He was almost certain that the Pray Codex represented the Turin Shroud. Poulle made a very interesting comparison with the holes visible in the Lierre Copy in 1516. (sorry, just in french) “Ce manuscrit Pray […] aujourd’hui conservé à Budapest et dont la provenance originale est hongroise, contient une série de cinq dessins consacrés à la Passion, dont le quatrième représente l’arrivée des saintes femmes au tombeau du Christ; y figure en bonne place une représentation du Linceul dans le sépulcre vide, représentation que des indices permettent d’identifier de façon quasi certaine comme figurant le Linceul aujourd’hui conservé à Turin : sur le dessin du Linceul ont été tracées en effet deux séries (une complète et une partielle) de quatre trous disposés en forme de L qui se retrouvent, en quatre emplacements symétriques, sur le Linceul aujourd’hui à Turin, et qu’on ne voit sur aucun des autres prétendus linceuls, sinon sur celui d’une copie du début du 16e siècle conservé à Lierre en Belgique, et qui est une copie, reconnue comme telle, du Linceul alors détenu par la maison de Savoie ; on ignore la raison de ces trous, qui sont vraisemblablement le résultat d’un accident dérisoire, mais les dessinateurs, celui du Codex Pray et de la copie de Lierre, ont eu conscience que ces petits trous sans importance faisaient partie intrinsèque du Linceul qu’ils reproduisaient.” \b\u0011.","date":"2014-06-22","mins":"2:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-133239","author":"tristan_casabianca","post":"Of course you can prove a negative! 1) You can “prove” (strong sense) that something is a self contradiction, therefore does not exist: a married bachelor. 2) You can “prove” (weak sense) that something does not exist with an inductive argument.

(1) an acknowledgement that induction is not bulletproof, airtight, and infallible, and (2) a desperate desire to keep believing whatever one believes, even if all the evidence is against it.” Or, in a nutshell, from a William Craig’s debate: “a popular line you hear on a popular level all the time, but that sophisticated atheists don’t take”..","date":"2014-06-28","mins":"3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-133247","author":"tristan_casabianca","post":"Colin, “no one can be reasonably expected to prove a negative”: thus, according to you, no one can be reasonably expected to prove that Napoleon Bonaparte was not born in the 17th century?
