But come midnight I was only halfway through the checklist and decided to call it a day! Thanks for the reminder. How much attention to detail do you suppose went into the statistical design of that protease experiment? Do you by any chance have a reprint of that Adler/Heller experiment? If so, could you maybe post some extracts here, and/or email it?.","date":"2013-02-28","mins":"4:40 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/shroudie-alert-day-10-a-newish-take-on-a-very-old-amulet/","cat":"barbecue","title":"Shroudie-Alert: Day 10.

We are dealing with someone commissioned to produce a souvenir badge with I believe – an ulterior motive to deflect unwelcome attention from the local bishop, and who was incredibly superb at his craft, incorporating a vast amount of fine detail into a relatively small badge. What’s more, his finished product would have been closely scrutinized by the de Charney/de Vergy family who set out to market their mischievous and enigmatic Shroud. The latter commissioned a badge, or series of badges, to ensure everything was on message – a subtly shifting message – carefully vetted to be free of silly and incriminating errors,. Nothing, absolutely nothing could be allowed that might have attracted unwelcome comment and thus compromised the entire project, possibly putting their lives at risk. Everything on that badge had to have a purpose. Making sure the figure was not too Christ like, but could be close enough to the Shroud image for the casual observer to have assumed it was MEANT TO REPRESENT Christ, but, you know, taxing the skills of a somewhat rustic craftsman, maybe not terribly good at his job, good on heraldry but hopeless with people bla bla, was all part and parcel of some very smart product positioning (and covert re positioning) that has brought us where we are today..","date":"2013-02-28","mins":"5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/shroudie-alert-day-10-a-newish-take-on-a-very-old-amulet/","cat":"barbecue","title":"Shroudie-Alert: Day 10.
