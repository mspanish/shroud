[{"id":"comment-3023","author":"colin_berry","post":"“But what is your question”? I’m not asking questions. (ed.at this precise moment in time). I’m providing a considered explanation as to why there is that curious addition of the face, presumably that of Jesus, to the Machy mould, above the word SUAIRE, and suggestive of a graft of the Veil of Veronica, an image reputedly formed from sweat, and named accordingly. If the artist had wished to make clear he was referring to the shroud, not a grafted on face cloth, added for dubious motives, e.g. To borrow on the reputation of the Veil, he could (and surely SHOULD) have used the term “linceul”, contrary to what you state. The evidence is there on that same etymology site. Enter the term “linceul” and you will find the following: 2. 2emoitié xiiies. [ms. Xives.] « drap servant à envelopper un cadavre pour l’ensevelir That says that the term “linceul” was in use to mean a burial shroud well before the Lirey exhibition (some 100 years), i.e. The second half of the 13th century. PS: I am assuming that the inset image added to the Machy Mould above “SUAIRE” is that of the Veil of Veronica. You may or may not agree, but see the comparison I have just added to the top of the posting, with more than a hint, methinks, of the give away ‘triple point’ beard between hair. So in that sense, it becomes irrelevant whether the artist should or could have used “linceul” instead of “suaire” if, as I believe, the intention was to label an image of the Veil – not that of the Shroud itself higher up (albeit with the intention of creating ambiguity, indeed confusion, in the viewers’ minds)..","date":"2014-02-16","mins":"8:48 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain."},{"id":"comment-3021","author":"colin_berry","post":"The etymology link you cite would at first sight appear to discount my thesis. But let’s not be over hasty. Etymology (admittedly not my forte) can throw up some other interesting possibilities re morphing of one term into another if one is prepared to think out of the box. Example: the term “le suaire” (burial shroud, from Latin “sudarium”) is quite similar to “la sueur” (perspiration, sweat from the Latin “sudorem”). Http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/sueur So we need to be absolutely certain that we are tracing “le suaire” back to the correct Latin root. I suspect that we are not, and that early references to face cloths in a biblical context, used to absorb and imprint sweat (Veil of Veronica etc) or even blood, were originally based on the Latin “sudorem”, not “sudarium” and that maybe early French “sueur” became confused with “suaire”, given that the Latin roots are so similar. I’ll continue to read around, but for now I’d say the plot thickens. PS. If one googles (sudarium etymology) one gets back a totally unexpected answer, with no mention of shroud, but a clear link with sweat AND napkin (face cloth) viz: Sudarium etymology Latin sudor (sweat) to sudarium (napkin) to sudarium (early 17th century) Early 17th century from latin, literally napkin, from sudor (sweat) This gets more interesting by the minute. Initially I thought it was just the French that had been manipulated to serve an agenda. Now it looks as though the Latin was manipulated too in order to legitimise the morphing of one French word into another. I’m not usually given to embracing, far less initiating conspiracy theories, but there’s an increasingly bad smell about the way the Machy mould and the badge it would have produced (assuming it did successfully produce Machy/Mark 2? Lirey badges) came to acquire that label “suaire” immediately under the ‘inset’ image of what would appear to be a face cloth, e.g Veil of Veronica, NOT Shroud..","date":"2014-02-16","mins":"3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/15/how-a-cunning-14th-century-visuo-semantic-marketing-ploy-helped-establish-the-authenticity-of-the-shroud-and-corrupted-the-french-language-into-the-bargain/","cat":"alain_hourseau","title":"How a cunning 14th century visuo-semantic marketing ploy helped establish the ‘authenticity’ of the Shroud – and corrupted the French language into the bargain."},{"id":"comment-3011","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks for getting back so soon.

Could I suggest we focus on just the first of those, at least for starters. Why should something as large as the TS come to be known as a face or head cloth, when that term has a separate and specific meaning in a biblical context (the headcloth being in a separate place from the major burial garment) and when there were celebrated face cloth relics like the Veronica Veil attracting pilgrims before the Lirey exhibition in the mid 1350s. Do you not consider it extraordinary that this semantic confusion was allowed to take root and persist to this very day? One is entitled to seek causes, and attempt to link with or relate to any other anomalies that one encounters in which the term “suaire” makes an early appearance in the context of the Shroud.

I’ll post a photograph in a day or two. For now, a stop press summary will have to suffice. If one blocks the linear channels between the fibres of linen with a water insoluble material, one can still get the initial bold imprint of roasted flour/oil in a hot oven, but one no longer gets the resistant ghost image that remains after washing (see this site’s banner).That supports my contention that the ghost image is the result of a LIQUID exudate from the thermal reaction. One small modification of technique was required. Initially I thought I could simply soak the linen in sodium silicate (water glass) solution instead of plain water before imprinting, and rely on the heat in the oven turning the silicate solution to solid glass before the browning of the flour/oil imprint. That didn’t work – the sodium silicate as supplied is highly alkaline, which makes the entire linen quickly go dark brown (probably due to facilitation of Maillard reactions at strongly alkaline p H). An alternative ploy was used: The linen was first soaked in sodium silicate solution, then dilute sulphuric acid dripped in to neutralise the alkali. As the mixture approaches neutrality (p H7) one sees a flocculent precipitate of hydrated silica gel, aka silicic acid. The latter presumably forms in situ between the narrow channels of the fibres, effectively clogging them up, so the same end result is achieved, albeit by a different mechanism, chemical rather than thermal. This latest finding does not prove conclusively that the final ghost imprint is the result of liquid migration, but offers in my view strong experimental support, especially as the outcome of the experiment was the fulfilment of a prediction based on my unique ‘capillary liquid migration’ model..","date":"2016-11-20","mins":"5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"id":"comment-8120","author":"colin_berry","post":"Competition!

But it would be nice to have a military component too, given the de Charny/Lirey link, providing the first appearance (?) of the double body imprint in history. In fact, you’ve reminded me of a narrative I was working on a few months ago, with gentle hints here on this site that something new was afoot. I’d been looking for a more compact package at the heating stage, and began experimenting with a deep oil fryer and rolled up bundles of imprinted linen. Hot oil? Anachronistic? Maybe, but I expect you’ve heard of medieval castles being defended against beseigers with a nasty addition called a “murder hole”. From wiki (my bolding): A murder hole or meurtrière is a hole in the ceiling of a gateway or passageway in a fortification through which the defenders could fire, throw or pour harmful substances or objects, such as rocks, arrows, scalding water, hot sand, quicklime, tar, or boiling oil, down on attackers. So they were no strangers to hot oil. But what about the logistics? You can’t get the oil up to temperature in minutes, but would not want to keep it either at boiling point purely on the offchance that the enemy suddenly arrives on the doorstep with battering rams etc. So one compromises. Right – one keeps the oil hot, needing just a few extra minutes to get it up to boiling point. But how do you know when it’s hot enough, mercury thermometers not having been invented? How about a crude ‘thermometer’ made by imprinting flour paste onto linen, and leaving to dry? One then heats up one’s oil from cold as soon as an enemy presence is detected, testing at intervals with flour imprinted strips of the linen. When the imprint turns a golden brown quickly, one knows the oil is up to temperature, but not boiling. OK, so it’s a long shot, but might this primitive thermometer technology have implanted the idea of imprinting an image onto linen with flour (paste, powder, oil/powder etc) and then developing the image with hot oil? I’m turning my thought right now to the tests needed in a STURP Mk2 to confirm the presence (or absence) of a flour/oil derived ghost image.

I believe I have discovered the technology employed, at least in principle. The image is an imprint onto wet or moistened linen of either a real man, or a representation thereof in carved wood or cast metal obtained using a dusting of white flour onto the oil precoated subject. Colour development (off white flour to yellow or brown imprint ) was obtained by thermal means, i.e. Gentle closely observed roasting of the imprinted linen in an oven or similar, with a final washing step with soap and water to remove all encrusted material, leaving only a faint discoloration as ‘contact imprint’. The unexpected feature of the model is the attribution of the image to a hot LIQUID exudate from the roasting flour/oil imprint into the fabric’s most superficial fibres. It is the capillary uptake of that exudate by linen fibres that accounts for the peculiar microscopic properties, notably the so called half tone effect and the discontinuities. It may well be that the aim was to simulate an ancient sweat imprint of an entire body – front, back but not sides – and to do so by a means that makes heated flour “sweat” a thermal cocktail of yellow or brown sugar protein Maillard compounds and other resinous , water insoluble high molecular weight reaction products into the superficial fibres of the fabric. The artisans may or may not have realized that the imprinting agent was a liquid at oven temperatures. All that mattered was the final faint imprint, one that would appear to have been accidentally, indeed, fortuitously acquired by the linen, or at any rate the most superficial fibres thereof. No, not a painting, which would have been instantly recognizable as such, but a faint IMPRINT (a negative, tone reversed image that is eerily comparable to a modern photographic negative, but which is NOT a photograph, being an image formed by physical contact only (no imaging across air gaps, no matter how small) with no role for radiant energy. Summary Those artisans wanted to create an image that could be mistaken for an ancient sweat imprint onto an enveloping up and over sheet of linen – essentially a rival attraction to the face only Veil of Veronica imprint, and one moreover with biblical authority (Joseph of Arimathea narrative). They succeeded, beyond their wildest dreams. How? By first taking an imprint of a body or effigy thereof onto moistened linen using white flour and a light smear of vegetable oil, and then developing that imprint in a hot oven at temperatures that caused the imprint to ‘sweat’ a yellowish brown liquid into the superficial fibres of the cloth. In other words, a cold sweat from the crucified Jesus was simulated by generating a hot ‘sweat’ from an imprint of a then ‘modern man’, obtained using two staple food items from a medieval kitchen. No fancy or anachronistic technology was needed – merely a knowledge of what happens when bread making and other flour doughs etc are roasted and/or fried at high temperature (though not so high as to materially change the linen fibres per se, the latter being chemically more resistant to browning than the carbohydrates and proteins of white flour).

So the science proceeds in its own plodding though I hope methodical and scientific manner (as scientific as possible without access, say, to an electron microscope etc that would simplify the task of counting fibres!). As for the politics and media, my thoughts have sadly crystallized there. One can quickly dispense with the second – my researches and the manner in which they are reported are not directed to the mass media, except for my generally jaundiced views of media reporting of this or that latest alleged ‘breakthrough’ in Shroud so called science.They are directed to the world of ideas, for which the internet might be considered ideally suited (though that’s sadly not proved to be the case – even when Dan Porter’s now extinct shroudstory blog site was providing updates on a daily and occasionally even hourly basis!). I shan’t mince my words. “Sindonology”, even when reported in peer reviewed journals, is for the most part fake scholarship. In genuine scholarship, one seeks out all new ideas, not just those that have appeared in print, but ones that may have been voiced at workshops, symposia etc and dare one say even the internet. One addresses them fairly and squarely, one gives sources in one’s bibliography wherever possible. What one doesn’t do is attenmpt to quickly diss them, as happened with monotonous frequency to this blogger’s initial forays into thermal imaging technology in early 2012 (the “scorch hypothesis”) with one sindonological big beast after another appearing on the Porter site to sneer, deride, dismiss, insult… That idea evolved gradually from being a one step imaging using hot metal bas relief to two step imaging using the flour/oil/hot oven imprinting method. Some of the criticism levelled against the first was taken seriously, but the model not immediately abandoned, given the valuable insights it provided into the properties of contact imprints, 3 D responses in the appriopriate modern software especially. But as soon as it evolved into the two step methodology using real human flesh as template, dispensing with hot metal, all reported in real time on the Porter site, the shutters came down. Sindonology did not want to know (Thibault Heimburger and David Goulet excepted, although the first of those has now also gone strangely silent). I cannot recall seeing a single reference to the flour/oil model anywhere in the sindonological literature the 15 months or more since it was first unveiled. Seek (Google) and ye shall not find! A failure to acknowledge new thinking, a freezing out, is as I say not genuine scholarship. It is a characteristic of propaganda, of fake scholarship. One sees it in its most flagrant form on the Stephen E.Jones site, a crass example if ever there was of religious bigotry.(He pops up from time to time to announce that I am still “permanently banned” from his site. It’s always “me” that is referred to, never the ideas… Here’s a word of adbvice to sindonology. Take another look at the grounds on which you have rejected contact imprinting. Note the manner in which you have begged the question by referring to what is or is not expected if a sheet of linen is or were to be draped loosely over a corpse, the latter recumbent on a 1st century shelf in a rock tomb. Think instead of a medieval scenario, one where there is purposeful imprinting off a LIVE and COOPERATIVE human subject, with complete control by the imprinting team over what anatomical features are or are not to be captured in the final (thermal) imprint. Until you make that switch from your biased model to one that is open minded and objective, I shall continue henceforth to accuse you of FAKE SCHOLARHIP, of attempting to blind and deceive your audience and/or readers with PSEUDOSCIENCE. You are, to put it more colourfully, charlatans, dispensers of snake oil medicine. You have earned my disdain, and in some instances personal contempt – not that either is likely to bother you in the slightest – given the manner in which you have so assiduously cultivated the media to bypass me and genuine plodding mainstream science..","date":"2016-11-04","mins":"8:01 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"id":"comment-8029","author":"colin_berry","post":"Here’s an entry that has just suddenly appeared at the top of Page 4 Google returns – search (shroud of turin) ANY TIME – yet it’s dated TODAY, 2nd November 2016! http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2016/11/02/a compelling case for the holy shroud of turin/ The headline reads: “A compelling case for the Holy Shroud of Turin”.

How could he have created a perfect photographic negative image?” In other words, the pseudo science from ENEA’s so called “scientists” which this retired scientist/blogger has been protesting these last 5 years in some 350 postings is now being cited as if the actual officially approved mechanism of image formation! “Perfect photographic negative”? Ouch. Propaganda, the crudest of crude pseudo scientific propaganda… Have they never heard of contact imprints that mimic (after a fashion) photographic negatives? Contact imprints (brass rubbings etc) were known and being made CENTURIES before photographic negatives. What’s more the images are/were ‘non directional’ (just like the Turin Shroud’s body image) making them distinct from modern era photographs taken with directional illumination). Disgraceful.

Nope, there’s no facility that I can see for leaving a comment on that article, despite the tagline on the Herald’s site that reads “Comment and Blogs”. Again, disgraceful.

Yes, there you will see the shameless reinvention of a professional documenting PHOTOGRAPHER attached to the 1978 34 strong STURP team (largely self selected) as a “scientist”. That’s the same “scientist” who jumped on me in early 2012, chiding me for not being aware that “all scorches fluoresce under uv light”. No, they don’t, and I doubt whether the photographer in question has eever bothered to test experimental scorches as I have done, being content as he was to wheel out someone else’s observation that the charred edges of the 1532 BURN HOLES on the Shroud fluoresce red or orange under uv light (reminder – a full depth burn hole with charred edges is not a typical superficial scorch as might produce a faint image). Keep cranking that pro authenticity handle, all you Shroudie propagandists, aided and abetted by the pliable Google search engine. Just don’t expect me to remain silent when I see this abuse of the internet and media outlets continuing year after year, with no intention of presenting a balanced story that reports findings from a non authenticity perspective (like my flour/oil imprinting model)..","date":"2016-11-02","mins":"8:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"id":"comment-8017","author":"colin_berry","post":"Summary thus far: this blogger is not categorically claiming the TS is something other than linen, e.g.hemp. He’s simply asking whether anyone in the modern era (starting early 20th century) ever bothered to check! Or has sindonology been content to accept without question the notion handed down through centuries that the TS is linen? If so, that’s hardly scientific, is it? Scientists are not supposed to accept anything without question, “commonsense assumptions” etc included… But then, there’s an awful lot of shortcutting in sindonology that regrettably distinguishes it from methodical, objective unblinkered science…. I’ve already given one reference that shows the acute difficulty of distinguishing between flax fibres in linen and those in hemp fabric (both being stem bast fibres with those ‘dislocations’ that distinguish from cotton). So I tried googling (shroud of turin hemp), and was truly amazed by what I found, right at the top of the list of returns. It was a paper delivered to a Shroud workshop in 2010 by one L.G. Thygesen (a Dane). He was working with TS fibres supplied to him by Prof Giulio Fanti of Padua University. Here’s the link. Http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/Thygesen Web.pdf I shall say no more for the present, and instead invite readers to view it for themselves (it’s a mere 4 pages long). However, here are two key passages: “It is a weakness of the study that the Turin Shroud flax fibres are compared to modern hemp fibres and not to modern flax fibres. However, these two fibre types have similar dimensions and properties, which in the author’s opinion justify the comparison. In a recent publication, it was pointed out that the two species may not be separated from each other using light microscopy (ref).” And this one from the Conclusions no less: “Analysis of the dislocations in 20 flax fibre segments from the Turin Shroud indicated that the dislocations in Turin Shroud flax fibres appear to be similar in amount, sizes and distances to dislocations in modern hemp fibres. Regarding dislocations there is thus no indication that these fibres are different from other bast fibres.” I resisted the temptation to insert sic after each of those mentions of Shroud “flax” fibres!.","date":"2016-10-31","mins":"10:47 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"id":"comment-8025","author":"colin_berry","post":"Why indeed David.

Either those threads are something other than TS type flax – possibly hemp – or maybe some other stem supporting bast fibre with flax/hemp fibre type dislocations under the microscope. Or is it maybe nothing to do with species? Might they be fibres from immature flax plants with skinny bast fibres? Immature would presumably mean having a less developed secondary cell wall, making the bast fibres thinner? Why use immature plants?

I have added a short section to the end of this posting, and will be setting out my reasons in the COMMENTS section under this posting, currently up to 25 pre hemp appearance. No, there will not be a new posting on the “hemp” hypothesis for the forseeable future. OK, so in an ideal blogging environment there would be.

The linen fibre still preserves the outermost layer of the supportive stem fibres of the phloem bundles, namely the primary cell wall (PCW). While it’s a bit difficult getting a precise figure for PCW thickness, it’s just one cell thick, and is reckoned to be considerably thinner than the 400nm your contact cites. I’ve seen figures of approx a quarter that thickness. Now the PCW also has a distinctive chemical composition, having larger amounts of the more chemically reactive hemicelluloses with 5 membered rings (xylose, arabinose especially). So if one assumes that it’s the most superficial hemicelluloses of the linen fibre per se that become chemically modified and coloured, all that’s needed to answer your contact is that image formation specifically involves the PCW and not the chemically less reactive underlying layers (multi layer secondary cell wall. But who’s to say that it’s the linen fibre per se that is chemically modified? I expect you’re aware of the Rogers’ hypothesis, namely that the image was formed on a starch coating that in his pro authenticity model was added at the stage of 1st century linen manufacture. I have a non authenticity model (14th century) that features white flour/vegetable oil as imprinting agent. The image appears when the the imprint is roasted in the oven, and is initially thick and crust like. But on final washing with soap and water all that’s left is a faint, scarcely visible and presumably highly superficial ghost image which I reckon is due to seepage of highly coloured oily LIQUID from the coating into the fibres. Again, all that’s necessary is to assume that it is the PCW that becomes selectively coloured, less so the underlying SCW layers.

The older one of the two, strawshredder site, non controversial content, has finally reappeared under its full title – better late than never. I wish I could say the same for the sciencebuzz posting, which is now nowhere to be seen, despite making a brief appearance under (past hour), (past day) etc. Seems those curators have been busy, taking a dislike maybe to the reference to ‘agenda driven so called science’ in the title. We’ll discuss the ethics of that another time, i.e. Of denying access to content deemed too outspoken. For now, here’s a copy (italics) of the entire posting, minus its relatively few and unimportant graphics: Well, I say it happened like this (approx chronological order): 1. It began with that astonishing landmark Secondo Pia tone reversal (negative to PSEUDO positive). (Graphic) Yes, a truly arresting image conversion, deserving of much analysis and interpretation re the photograph like appearance of that pseudo positive on the right (above). But that has been taken to mean the TS is a positive photograph, as recently as this last week (Stephen E. Jones site). NO! Why not? Watch this space. Discussion will centre on FREE HAND SKETCHES and IMPRINTS, specifically contact imprints, NOT photographs. As for contact imprints – making the point better than sketches and photographs – they have a long history, going back centuries ( like those brass rubbings in churches and cathedrals). (Graphic) The concept of positive negative would have been recognized long before photography, even if the terms were not employed. 2. Irrelevance of Walter Mc Crone’s microscopy to the body image, attempting to implicate dispersed solid paint pigments – iron oxide, mercury sulphide etc, given that other STURP members, notably Heller and Adler, discovered that the image was bleachable with diimide (which acts ONLY on organic compounds with C=C double bonds). Same consideration applies to pop historian Charles Freeman – traditional inorganic paint pigments, fresh or faded, can be ruled out. Details to come. Watch this space. 3. Attempts have been made to this day to exclude thermal processes, especially relevant in context of ‘appropriate’ medieval technology. How? By reference to uv fluorescence. But they are not based on modern experimental data. They are based on the uv fluoresence of the charred edges of the 1532 burn holes, with claim that “all scorches fluorescence under uv”. Taking as one’s sole reference a centuries old event involving fire, exceedingly high combustion or carbonization temperatures – ones creating full thickness burns, not mere scorches – is pseudoscience. Scorches incidentally are just one type of thermal change. Details to come watch this space. 4. Rogers’ starch coating theory: good inasmuch as it considered the possibility of the image being an added coating, highly superficial, instead of on the linen per se. But why did he stop at purified starch, and proceed to develop a theory as if starch were equivalent to – or easily transformable to – a reducing sugar? Answer: he cited Pliny, 1st century linen technology, betraying (intentionally or otherwise) a pro authenticity bias that hitherto had been well concealed. He should have considered a wider range of coatings, including those that could have been deployed in a medieval context. Details to come. Watch this space. 5. The TS body image responds to computer software programs that map image density as height, ie. Creating an imaginary z (vertical) dimension. So what? All imprints and indeed diagrams with no 3 D history respond the same – it being a function of the software and the way it re processes image density – NOT a tool for investigating supposed “encoded 3 D information”. Yup, starry eyed hyping – up of the so called 3 D properties of the TS, as if specific for the TS, with inappropriate refs to conventional photographs performing poorly – distortions etc – only to be expected due to lateral lighting, shadowing etc. (focus should be on imprints!). Details to come. Watch this space. 6. The blood story. First on scene was the pathologist Robert Bucklin MD, publishing and proselytizing his pro authenticity views way back in the 60s, long before STURP, using the terms “bloodstain” and “wound” interchangeably. NO! There is no evidence on the body image for wounds as distinct from blood, despite explicit claims to the contrary. It is entirely unscientific to describe a bloodstain as a “wound”, if there is no independent evidence in the body image for speared, flayed or punctured skin. Even the scourge marks are blood imprints ONLY! Details to come. Watch this space. 7. Failure of STURP to provide convincing evidence for the existence of blood derived porphyrins – an essential criteria for identifying the stains as derived from blood. Atypical porphyrin spectra, coupled with claims the blood was “too red” were attributed to presence of ‘extraordinary levels of bilirubin’ with no hard evidence for the presence of ANY bilirubin (which is photochemically unstable and unlikely to survive for months, far less centuries). As with Rogers. The ‘bilirubin trauma’ hypothesis betrayed a pro authenticity leaning, unbecoming surely of hands on researchers willing to investigate (and exclude ) the painting hypothesis while failing to display appropriate scepticism elsewhere. “Blood before image’ claim, based on enzymic micro spotting test was interesting, possibly true, but questionable in the light of other data, notably the so called half tone effect which means that blood coated fibres sampled with sticky tape from’ image areas’ cannot be assumed to have been image bearing fibres, as appears to have been the case. Yup, blind spot territory … Details to come. Watch this space. 8. Returning to the body image (it being the basis of the “enigmatic” tag): there has been indecent haste to exclude contact imprinting, based on image intensity data that assumes linen draped loosely over a body, making limited contact. We are quickly asked to consider imaging across air gaps, of “cloth body” distance being critical, albeit with peculiar qualfications (max distance of separation not to exceed approx 4 cm for example). That model ‘begs the question’ i.e. Assumes the very thing that is being tested, making for a circular argument. What if the cloth had NOT been draped loosely, as in a 1st century tomb, but pressed firmly against some body features and not others, with conscious control over which parts to imprint, what not. (Consider selective application of imprinting medium also). Details to come. Watch this space. 9. The assumption that image formation occurred across air gaps, with exclusion of contact imprinting as the sole mechanism, has led to those “radiation” models, associated at least initially by STURP team leader John Jackson. With resort to biblical “resurrection” scenarios that permit a body and /or linen to merge in space (“collapsing cloth” theory”). That has no place in a scientific context, being impossible to put to an experimental test., being merely a highly coloured interpretation, wishful thinking some might think. Details to come. Watch this space. 10. X ray or gamma ray imaging? Based on claims that the fingers are ‘too boney” or teeth are imaged, with failure to consider, far less to model experimentally, contact imaging that might well produce such effects through providing something more resistant under the linen than soft tissue. Details to come. Watch this space. 11. Assumption that the TS represents a “burial shroud”, when the biblical record suggests otherwise (namely that Joseph of Arimathea’s’s linen was intended solely for dignified TRANSPORT of a bloodied, naked or near naked man from cross to tomb, NOT as final burial shroud. See my late 2014 posting from this site for more details, including artistic representation, e.g: (Graphic) Here’s Joseph of Arimathea’s ‘clean linen’ being used as an improvised means of transport from cross to tomb, with no biblical evidence it was ever used, or intended to be used as final burial shroud. (Di Ciseri, 1883). See also this posting from my specialist Shroud site with more artwork showing the Shroud being deployed in ‘transport mode’. (Graphic) Resurrection scenarios for image formation are excluded in the transport only model if J of A’s linen was replaced with ‘winding strips’ as suggested by the Gospel according to John. Instead, the focus should be on the possibility that the TS was an attempt to recreate what a sweat/blood imprint onto a transport shroud might look like 13 centuries later. Details to come. Watch this space. 12.Failure to give due consideration or even acknowledge that the TS body image may have been an attempt to simulate a sweat imprint, with bloodstains alone used to implicate a particular and highly revered crucified body , i.e. That of Jesus of Nazareth, with crown of thorns (missing), lance wound, nails wounds etc. (See previous ref to blood that serves as proxy for “wounds” that are otherwise absent from body image). Details to come. Watch this space. 13. Failure to acknowledge the resources at the disposal of Geoffroi de Charny (France’s King John the Good’s favourite, both when younger as fellow 100 Year’s War combatants and later at the Royal Court ), the king having financially assisted his knight/comrade in arms in founding and staffing a so called private chapel (5 6 staff!). Those hired clerics may well have been the initiators, possibly even artisans, who originated the idea/project to recreate J of A’s transport linen with a simulated sweat/blood imprint. Sindonology rarely considers the crucial and arguably historical role of G de C and his wife, later widow, despite both their individual coats of arms appearing on that Lirey pilgrim’s souvenir badge (Cluny Museum) indicating a determined effort to attract pilgrims from far and wide ,the latter paying handsomely no doubt for the indulgences etc to be had at the oh so fashionable “Shroud” shrine, a rival and closer attraction than the then extant ‘Veil of Veronica’. Details to come. Watch this space. 14. Italy’s Govt. Supported ENEA research institute (team leader Paolo Di Lazzaro): uv laser modelling. No image – mere superficial coloration only. No detailed consideration of likely chromophore – merely refs to cellulose as the target, despite that carbohydrate consisting entirely of stable C C, C O and O H single bonds – i.ie no C=C or other double bonds as is usually the case for molecules that are susceptible to chemical change resulting from absorption of energetic uv radiation. Sure, the coloration may be superficial, but it’s wrong to assume that supernatural radiation is the only means of producing a superfical image, with laser pulses offered optimistically as a weak modern day proxy (the nearest man made equivalent you understand). Let’s not mince our words – it was deplorable pseudoscience to make that suggestion, especially when accompanied by refs to philosophy, theology etc and being described as “scientists” in newspaper headlines when in fact the investigators were laser technologists, said to be working after hours with their Govt supplied hardware to promote and proselytize their preferred take on scripture. Summary: The major failure in this list, 14 points so far? I would nominate that failure to consider the TS as a sweat imprint, whether as I believe simulated (14th century) or even ‘authentic’ of 1st century origin, there being a clear ambition to link the TS image with supernatural flash of radiation at the instant of biblical resurrection. See banner on Stephen E. Jones ‘blog’ (manifesto?) for the continuing attempt to make that link, based not on science but PSEUDOSCIENCE. So where does one go to find the non derailed still on track science, steadily chuffing along, making progress, month after month, year after year? Why, my specialist Shroud site of course, started in early Spring 2012, reporting researches in real time (some 350 postings there and elsewhere to date)! (Graphic) This investigator’s specialist Shroud site (showing current posting at 13 Oct, 2016 with modelling of TS body image using 1/12 scale ‘Galaxy Warrior figurines) The current model (and indeed I suspect the FINAL one) is what I call the oil/flour thermal imprinting model. See the above link for details. I’ve also added a series of photographs on a recently resurrected subsidiary Shroud site showing how it’s done in 10 simple steps. I used my own hand as ‘subject’ to show how the imprinting technique works as well if not better with human skin.

Powerful forces are at work, messing with search engine rankings, attempting to suppress the idea that the TS is not authentic (i.e an image of the crucified Jesus). Some of us at any rate, this investigator included, are not attempting to directly challenge the authenticity of the Shroud, being more concerned with how an artefact could have been so skillfully executed in the medieval era as to give rise to that delusional idea in the late 20th/early 21st century era. If there were a shroud image that looked even remotely and genuinely 1st century AD, I for one would have given it my closest consideration. But that is scarcely credible. What’s being challenged on this site is the idea that the TS is 1st century AD, when all the evidence points to it having a 14th century origin. That’s not just on account of the disputed radiocarbon dating, but through it being easily modelled ( as discovered and reported here) with simple homely larder ingredients and standard age old kitchen amenities (vegetable oil, white flour and access to a hot bread baking oven).

My reply: the project was newsworthy in a different respect, namely having been set up as possibly, indeed probably, the first time a research project has been pursued from start to finish via live reporting on the internet (some 350 postings to date since Dec 2011). The model has already been ‘peer reviewed’ notably here (e.g. Thibault Heimburger) and on my sciencebuzz site, and on the now discontinued Dan Porter shroudstory blog.

The second roadblock: why had I not shown it works with a real life size human being, instead of my hand, plastic effigies etc. I suggested that David Rolfe, of the “Enigma Challenge” be contacted, and I’d happily waive his promised reward of £20k royalty for his being allowed to make a filmed recording of the experiment as a TV documentary.

Watch this space (yes, I’m allowed to add, subtract and otherwise edit my own comments!). Back again. What was the purpose of the first experiment? Answer: I wanted to know if it was really necesaary to heat to 200 degrees C or thereabouts to get a bold flour/oil image. Might a lower temperature, maybe for a longer time, suffice, with less risk of excessive yellowing or browning of the background linen. So I made a flour imprint of my hand, and placed in cold oven, heating to 150 degress C and holding the temperature there for 15 mins. The linen was removed, photographed, and thumb (labelled sample 1) cut off, and imprint returned to oven. The temperarure was then raised to 160 degrees, again for 15 mins, and the inspection/digit removal repeated. The final temperature (190 degrees C, 15 mins) ended with removal of the final digit (sample 5, small finger). Result: there was slight visible yellowing at 150 C, and progressive intensification of colour at each 10 degrees rise in temp. But it was clear that the major factor determining final colour after 15 mins heating was the TEMPERATURE. One cannot expect to get a “190 C colour” by heating at lower temperatures, even for prolonged periods. The colour at each temparature stabilizes, then remaining approximately the same. That fits with the idea, discussed in previous postings, that the colour is the result of Maillard reactions which are not only under kinetic but thermodynamic control as well (temperature being needed to make certain reactions “go”, over and above mere increases in rates of chemical reaction). But if colour stabilizes at each chosen temperature, that has an important consequence. One might not need to have the linen suspended as a sheet in the oven to ensure even colour development. Maybe one could fold or roll it up. OK, the outer layers would heat up first and the flour/oil imprint acquire colour before the inner parts. But if the colour then stabilized on the outer parts, it gives time for the inner parts to ‘catch up’ so to speak. So that was the reasoning that led to doing the second experiment, result shown on the right, one where the linen was folded and then rolled/scrolled up. Details to come. Watch this space. Here’s a photo of the scrolled linen in the oven – a neat and compact package. Https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dsc01515.jpg?w=640&h=480 First it was heated to 150 C, and that temperature held for 15mins. It was then removed from the oven, unfolded, photographed, then returned for further heatings steps, each 10 degrees higher than the one before. Yes, the colour intensity increased stepwise as expected. The photo on the right is the appearance at the end of the sequence (190 C max temperature). And very satisfactory it was too, indeed one of the best images ever obtained for my hand imprinting, with no sign whatsoever of uneven colour distribution that might have been expected from being folded/rolled up. So our medieval artisans could have used a modest size oven – or even open charcoal fire – for the ‘roasting’ procedure. They could have heated the linen package gradually, removing at intervals to open out the package, checking on progress, and continuing until they had the desired degree of colour development, assured of EVEN colour intensity, provided the heating was done gradually to ensure that all parts were exposed to the same temperature for an extended time period to allow for heat to penetrate to the interior..","date":"2016-09-28","mins":"9:46 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"id":"comment-7831","author":"colin_berry","post":"Forgive me if I prime the Comments on this my most recent posting. There’s an issue that I wish to flag up, say what’s in my mind, then try to put it out of said mind altogether. It’s to do with that so called ” Shroud International Conference” planned for next July in Pasco, Washington State, USA. Here’s a cut and paste from the prospectus: “We are pleased to announce that an international conference on the Shroud of Turin will be held in the United States from Wednesday, July 19th through Saturday, July 22nd, 2017. The conference will be held in the Tri Cities in the state of Washington. The Tri Cities consists of the communities of Richland, Kennewick and Pasco, is located in the southeastern part of the State of Washington, and has a population of about 260,000. The Tri Cities was selected for the conference because Richland is one of the premier research centers in the United States. Holding the conference in the Tri Cities will assist in locating additional personnel for research on the Shroud, since Richland has one of the highest ratios of Ph Ds per capita of anywhere in the country, due to the many research laboratories in the area.” Where are most contributors to an “international” conference likely to come from, not counting the USA (or the splendid but relative few in Australia and New Zealand) ? Answer – from Europe naturally. So why stage a conference on the western seaboard of the USA, effectively doubling the journey time, airfares, to say nothing of jet lag for European attendees? And why choose as one’s venue a God forsaken giant parking lot with conference centre that looks for all the world like a corrugated iron aircraft hangar?

Tests on the Shroud itself are clearly discounted, unless one were able to suggest a critical one that could be done non invasively (and even then, one does not expect the Turin custodians to lay out a welcome mat). Nope, what’s needed in the first instance is a refinement of the model system that reveals exactly what one is dealing with – physically and chemically – in the high temperature Maillard reaction proposed. An essential first step is to ELIMINATE LINEN from the experimental system, since the hypothesis makes no claim for an involvement of linen components – the spotlight being on what happens to the flour/oil imprinting medium when heated, with the suggestion that the crucial first step is production of a liquid exudate that can then seep into linen fibres. In chemical terms, linen is being seen as a passive bystander, serving merely to act as a ‘blotting paper’ for a yellow or brown LIQUIFIED thermal cocktail. The difficulty is that the proposed exudate contains the precursors of high molecular weight Maillard condensation products (“melanoidins”). Once those high molecular resin like products form they are then difficult if not impossible to analyse and characterize. Might it be possible to draw off the thermal cocktail at the instant of formation, maybe cooling and arresting the process of condensation (that’s chemical condensation, akin to polymerization), allowing the latter to be studied at leisure under lab conditions, maybe by re applying heat?
