Where the TS is concerned, forget about the then extant trends in art – except maybe for blood additions, or ‘touching up’ that may well have used applied paint. The body image itself cannot be claimed to be paint unless you have compelling scientific evidence to back that up (which you don’t). It didn’t need to be paint, if the aim had been to trump the Veil of Veronica with a simulated negative sweat imprint.

It’s to be seen as an IMPRINT, almost certainly a CONTACT IMPRINT. In a non authenticity model that does not necessarily mean it was produced as a contact imprint, e.g. Off some kind of applied bas relief template (though it may well have been, given its 3 D properties. It’s just conceivable that it was painted freehand in a manner as to make the image SEEM like an imprint. But there again, the artisans would not have considered themselves restricted to classical artists’ pigments, if as seems probable the aim was to produce an image that would not be instantly regarded (and just as quickly dismissed) as merely a flight of fancy painting on linen. So whichever way you look at it, there’s no justification whatsoever for making any assumption, either a priori or from Charles’s post hoc review of what he terms “interlocking” evidence, that the image was painted. In any case, it’s grossly unscientific to assume (without independent evidence) the present image is what’s left when the paint has ENTIRELY flaked off. Why the survival of 3 D properties if that had been the case? Why the STURP evidence based on diimide bleaching, reflectance spectroscopy etc that the body image comprises dehydrated linen carbohydrates? Why should a coating of gesso and paint have produced chemical changes that in the laboratory require elevated temperature or dehydrating acids such as H2 SO4. Why all the focus on blood, which may well have been partly or totally paint when the real challenge, not to be ducked, is the subtle BODY IMAGE aka IMPRINT that caused consternation when first displayed at Lirey? This entire paint thing is an attempt to bury well over a century of image analysis, starting with Secondo Pia’s amazing photographic ‘negatives’ that restored the TS ‘positive’. Classical paintings do not do that, not even faded or flaked off ones, correction least of all leaving scarcely visible (when viewed up close) low contrast remains. It’s getting on for 9 months since I first floated the idea that the TS was fabricated as a simulated sweat imprint, a whole body front and back version of the then celebrated Veil of Veronica.

But note I said “exceptional”, not “unique”. It may seem at first glance like splitting hairs, but one has to consider not only the response to 3 D imaging, but the nature of what one is uploading to that software – bold/high contrast/high colour saturation images on the one hand versus the scarcely visible “as is” TS image. I’m preoccupied with another science project at the moment, prompted by a news item this morning and non TS related, so will have to keep this brief. If you take, say, Irene Corgiat’s passable pyrograph copy of the TS and put it into Image J you get very little 3 D response. If you make a bold charcoal copy like yours, the 3 D response is better. If you take a contact scorch off a bas relief etc it’s better still, comparable if not better than the TS. I for one have never agreed with those who were saying back in 1980 that the 3 D response of the TS was unique and unobtainable with modern photographs or drawings etc. But I still say it’s exceptional. Why is that? Answer: because you can start with a photograph of the TS, like that I talked about recently on the BBC’s site (Halta Defiizione image), one that is scarcely visible against background (realistic!) and without any further adjustment of contrast, brightness etc upload it to Image J and get a very reasonable response. I’ve just this minute done that exercise. Here’s the result: What price the idea that the TS image is all that’s left of a painting from which ALL detectable pigment has flaked off?

So why is the hair the way it is, seemingly glued to the skin? Because that’s the way that sweat laden hair might look. Why are the buttocks so prominent? Because that’s where there’s a large area of contact between subcutaneous fat and skin that traps perspiration, preventing it from evaporating quickly.

At about this time, a year ago, I was in Turin, and, while pointing out the Holy Shroud among such a great crowd of people, a few drops of sweat fell from my face on to this Holy Shroud itself. Whereupon, our heart made this wish: May it please You, Saviour of my life, to mingle my unworthy sweat with Yours, and let my blood, my life, my affections merge with the merits of Your sacred sweat! My very dear Mother, the Prince Cardinal was somewhat annoyed that my sweat dripped onto the Holy Shroud of my Saviour; but it came to my heart to tell him that Our Lord was not so delicate, and that He only shed His sweat and His blood for them to be mingled with ours, in order to give us the price of eternal life. And so, may our sighs be joined with His, so that they may ascend in an odour of sweetness before the Eternal Father. But what am I going to recall? I saw that when my brothers were ill in their childhood, my mother would make them sleep in a shirt of my father’s, saying that the sweat of fathers was salutary for children. Oh, may our heart sleep, on this holy day, in the Shroud of our divine Father, wrapped in His sweat and in His blood; and there may it be, as if at the very death of this divine Saviour, buried in the sepulchre, with a constant resolution to remain always dead to itself until it rises again to eternal glory.

If I could, It would be my still unwritten piece for the New Scientist or similar that we’d be discussing right now instead of your historico religious version of events. Here, off the top of my head, are some of the points I have made over the last 3 years in well over 200 blog postings. I don’t expect a point by point critique, but challenge you to provide a single damning objection: 1. The failure of STURP to detect paint, suggesting something other than a painted image. 2. The precedent of the Veil of Veronica, reputed according to legend to be a sweat imprint. 3. The visual evidence from the Lier copy of the image being faint, and other visual cues it was formed in sweat (sodden looking hair, prominent imprint from buttocks) 4. The negative image and 3 D properties, suggesting some kind of contact imprint. 5. The double image, to convey the idea of an imprint left by a corpse, probably/likely as bodily secretion that would been profuse due to events preceding a traumatic death. 6. The nudity, suggestive of a body imprint that made no concessions to finer sensibilities. 7. The present faintness of the image, with nothing except conjecture to suggest it was ever significantly more prominent. 8. The over flagellation etc that can be interpreted as means of making a faint body image more prominent. 9. The various blank regions in the body image that imply the image was intended to be seen as a contact imprint, with failure to imprint in places, thus not a painting. 10. The sole use of blood to mark the sites of wounds, with no imprinting of open wounds per se, suggestive of a simple “incomplete” template to simulate a sweat imprint. 11. The Veil of Veronica like motif added to the Machy mould with the word “SUAIRE”, that might simply mean facecloth, but has connotations of sweat too. 12. Frances de Sales letter to his mother after seeing the TS, displaying a fixation not just with blood, but sweat stains too. As you see, no killer points, just an accumulation of suggestive evidence.

What you cannot do is come back with pro authenticity thinking that makes its own qualifying assumptions and imagine they have any relevance to my medieval thought experiment scenario, with incomplete knowledge of actual historical events, and based instead on an imaginative reconstruction of those events, accurate or otherwise (probably the latter). But there’s a further sting in the tail, as I have flagged up on the News Sentinel artticle. The description of the Shroud as a “burial” cloth goes beyond the biblical record. It is based on making a number of qualifying assumptions, all presupposing authenticity, and then uses that label “burial cloth” essentially to promote authenticity via the back door, so to speak. That back door is then left open so as to admit further fanciful speculation, requiring still more qualifying assumptions e.g. Thatthat the superficial body image could only have been formed by miraculous flash of radiation at the instant of resurrection (overlooking to mention that the image thickness corresponds roughly with that of the primary cell wall of the flax bast fibre). The desription of the TS as a “burial shroud” is an egregious example of “begging the question”. There is no greater academic sin one can commit, short of downright fraud, than to create and promote lines of argument that “beg the question”, ones that carelessly or shamelessly create a closed loop between preconceptions and conclusions.

The references to “wound in linen… as is the manner of Jews to bury” and later, in Chapter 20, verse 7, to “the napkin about the head, not lying with the linen clothes” should have been sufficient to make clear that the “winding” linen used for final interment was different from that used earlier as a makeshift stretcher from cross to tomb.

You know, like being totally and utterly impervious to the self evident truth that the TS of Lirey was seen either as the real burial shroud of Jesus,OR a very clever forgery thereof (whether produced by an artist or craftsman or, as I now, believe an alchemist). To maintain as Freeman does that a bishop’s belief that a forgery was the work of an artist means that the image was ipso facto produced by standard artistic methods, applying classical pigments – and indeed a less probable option – paints instead of inks/dyes is frankly astonishing, given the fanfare write up in ‘History Today’. It has to be one of the most egregious errors of logic I have encountered in a lifetime spent almost entirely in education and research. Why? Because Freeman has taken that bishop’s brief reference to “painted”, omitting to mention that it was “cunningly” painted, omitting to mention the “sleight of hand”, and omitting references to the end result as an “impression” or “imprint”, and omitting all the commonsense, to say nothing of supporting science, that says a negative image is an imprint, not a free hand painting. What leads someone not in his first flush of youth to inflict this dud thesis on us all? Not knowing the gentleman personally,one can only speculate. Here, for what it’s worth, is my opinion. Freeman is suffering from “stamp collectors syndrome”. He had an album devoted entirely to forged stamps, a minority interest, but valid. His forged stamps were holy relics of the early Christian Church, all faux by his reckoning, collected in the course of his Mediterranean tour guide duties (“day job” it would seem unless a man of private means). But there was one prize that eluded him – in philatelic terms the 1 cent British Guiana (of which there is one and only one). It would be like me with my 60 year old stamp collection, put together from buying largely low value stamps “on approval”, driven by a desire to ‘complete sets’, and lusting for a particualr ‘out of financial reach’ trophy stamp on auction at Stanley Gibbons, one costing not shillings or pounds, but hundreds of thousands or millions. I personally gave up stamp collecting when I realized it was an obsession, indeed a disease. Becoming a teenager and discovering the opposite sex helped too. “You must come and see my stamp collection” never did the trick. Charles should just accept that the 1 cent British Guiana is not for his collection, at least not in the album devoted to “painted relics”. He has ceased to see the wood for the trees. He’s over reached himself and can’t or won’t admit it. Let’s leave it at that. Progress update on ‘Model 9’. I have a faster way of checking out variables now in a semi realistic model system. It’s also arguably an opposite extremity version of the TS. I paint the topside and underside of my toes with each new imprinting medium, step onto the lower half of a strip of linen placed horizontally on the floor to get first a LUWU imprint. I then fold the surplus back onto the top surface to capture the LOTTO imprint. Varying degrees of manual moulding can be applied with LOTTO, not with LUWU, with more or less imaging of side contours, more or less risk of lateral distortion. A compact package can be made of the dual up and over imprint that fits nicely into its own jar for Stage 2 chemical development (nitric acid vapour). Results from the first footie session are drying on the radiator as I write. I compared (1) flour (2) egg tempera and (3) a mixture of flour and egg tempera The egg tempera was simply beaten egg yolk, as used as a vehicle for pigments by medieval artists before oil paints became available. I am NOT using pigments, needless to say, but Stage 2 chemical development to intensify colour (yellow or brown). No, CF, using egg tempera should NOT be taken to mean that this blogger subscribes to your eccentric ideas, regardless of what drives them. Egg tempera was simply available in the 14th century as an agent that sticks well to canvas, linen etc. It’s also the right colour from the word go for simulating an ancient sweat imprint.

The very first “scorch” model I proposed, back in December 2011 was a radiation scorch (“thermostencilling”) http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.gr/2011/12/turin shroud could it have been.html The difference between that and the one proposed by the pro authenticity ENEA group with its uv excimer lasers was that mine worked with radiation from an ordinary incandescent light bulb, ie. A mix of visible and infrared (i.e. Ordinary everyday light and heat). The ‘trick’ if one may call it such, was to paint the linen with a slurry of charcoal, the latter acting as a trap for electromagnetic radiation that was so efficient that the temperature rise was rapid enough to scorch the linen in immediate contact with the charcoal. The charcoal could then be washed out to leave the scorched in image. However, there was one enormous drawback with that model, namely that the artist would have needed to have painted the image as a negative, and a medieval artist who had never laid eyes on a photographic negative would probably not have thought of doing that. Thus the move to contact scorching. It automatically produces a negative imprint off a heated template whether one wants it or not. But that model too always had some unsatisfactory features, like working only with inanimate templates, not real human subjects. But it was pursued for a while for the opportunities it offered to explore 3 D properties. First I could show that contact scorches produced 3 D images as good if not better than the TS, and finally that computer generated 2 D images (Microsoft Paint!) with no 3 D history could also be 3 D rendered. The switch from thermal contact scorching came about through reading the work of Garlaschelli, with its hints that acids could produce “etching” effects, i.e. Chemical scorching, later reinforced by Joe Accetta’s woodblock imprinting model, with its references to inks and iron mordants, possibly to dyes and alum mordants too. Alum solutions hydrolyse partially to sulphuric acid. Might the H2 SO4 be the real imprinting medium? Abandon contact scorching: let’s try acid scorching. Let’s not allow ourselves to be permanently wed to yesterday’s model. So yes, things have moved on from contact scorches, as they moved on from 2011 vintage radiation scorches. It’s in the nature of science to move on from one model to another, constantly testing strengths and weakness, constantly attempting to refine existing models, but always being ready to dump if a new and better model suggests itself, relying on inspiration from other researchers. That’s science bizz! It’s essentially collegiate in nature. Don’t tell anyone I told you so. As I say, models evolve.

Your comment is most gratifying, and shows true generosity of spirit, given our differences in the past. In an earlier comment here yesterday, I was deliberating on what should be the ideal consistency of the imprinting medium in order to achieve best 3 D effects. I said it should be paint like, i.e. Tacky and viscous, so as to stay where applied on the 3 D subject, since if runny, it would flow off the highest points of the relief down into the hollows and mess up the 3 D rendering. Oops. I was forgetting that gravity can be made to work for one. If you want a liquid imprinting medium to stay put on the highest relief, and indeed concentrate at the highest points, then turn the subject (or template) upside down before imprinting, and press it DOWN into linen. There are two types of subject to linen presentation one can use when imprinting, what I have previously called LUWU (Linen Underneath, With Underlay) and LOTTO (Linen On Top, Then Overlay). Use the LUWU configuration(even if easier said that done where real people are concerned). That requires painting the subject with imprinting material, then lying face DOWN into the linen to imprint the FRONTAL surface. If the medium is fairly runny and mobile, then in the brief time the subject positions himself face DOWN, the medium runs to the LOWEST points of the relief, due to gravity, which would have been the HIGHEST points when face up. It is the concentration of medium at the new lowest relief that might generate most if not all of the negative and 3 D properties of the final 2 D imprint. OK, so it might be tricky to get a clean imprint via LUWU. However, the purpose in hinting at a gravity aided model is not to suggest this was how imprinting was actually achieved, but simply to flag up the wealth of options on offer. Yes, one risks attracting unflattering references to Occam’s Razor. But having a range of options for modelling is not the same as needing to attach a host of qualifying assumptions to a model through having a limited range of options..","date":"2015-05-09","mins":"12:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198116","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thank you Angel.

Such sudden appearances of cults were common in a Europe recovering from the trauma of the Black Death. They caused a great deal of frustration for a Church hierarchy anxious to preserve its own status. The bishop of Troyes, Henry of Poitiers, whose responsibility it was to monitor such claims in his diocese, investigated the shrine and reported that, not only were the images painted on the cloth, but that he had actually tracked down the painter. After this clerical onslaught, the Shroud was hidden away for more than 30 years. Yet the Church accepted that it was not a deliberate forgery and in January 1390 the (anti )pope Clement VII allowed its renewed exposure in Lirey. This suggests that the Shroud may have been credited with unrecorded miracles, thereby acquiring the spiritual status to make it worthy of veneration. Doubtless aware of the earlier claims by the Lirey clergy, Clement insisted that it was publicly announced before each exposition that this was NOT the burial shroud of Christ.” Ask yourself this question: does it accurately convey the sense of the original? Look to see how Charles dealt with terms like “cunningly” and “sleight of hand” If it doesn’t, then ask yourself this question: is Charles’s “History Today” piece a work of detached and objective scholarship, or merely a spin doctored re hash of a crucial historical document, unworthy of a true academic?.","date":"2015-05-04","mins":"3:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"id":"comment-198249","author":"colin_berry","post":"“Colin, Have you any idea as to why anyone would want to carry this bizarre operation?” Perhaps you’ll find your answer here, Charles: it’s something I’ve copied/pasted from an earlier posting on my own site, one that has your name in the title.

My beef is with those so called scientists (better described as engineers and technologists in most instances) who say that the TS image characteristics are unexplainable with conventional science, who for the most part have done scarcely any scientific research in the lives, who handle things and applications, not ideas, not concepts, not experimental models. They even attend and/or give papers workshops that have provocative titles like “INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON THE SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO THE ACHEIROPOIETOS IMAGES “. Yes,unbelievable, isn’t it, that they assume the TS has a supernatural origin (“not made by human hand”), despite that not being the position of all adherents to authenticity, yet maintain they are adopting a scientific approach. When was a supposed supernatural event ever reproduced in the laboratory? What are the specific signatures of a supernatural event? Is there a manual on the subject? My aim is simply stated: to show that a faint and superficial negative image can be imprinted onto linen, using contact with a real person or effigy. I see absolutely no difficulty re the 200nm visible image thickness, that being the approx thickness of the flax PCW.

I used LUWU geometry for starters, it being simpler and more predictable ( LUWU = Linen Underneath, With Underlay).

I do Charles. The chemical composition of cell walls, whether of flax or other flowering plants, in terms of celluloses, hemicelluloses and pectins has been essentially constant for millennia. Nature is very conservative in these matters. Hemicelluloses cross link and thus stiffen cellulose microfibrils via hydrogen bonding interactions. It works. Why change it? Hemicelluloses may well be the key to understanding the TS image and probably the mechanical weakening of image bearing fibres as well, due to their disruption in the PCW and SCW by the image making process (regardless of mechanism). Pectins are an essential component of the middle lamellae that separate bast fibres in flax. They bind calcium too (probably the source of your “gesso”).There are no grounds for thinking that the more fragile (relative to cellulose) hemicelluloses and pectins are different in modern v medieval linen.

Http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/shroud of turin was lightly roasted.html : For the moment, let’s address just two extra details. How was the cloth sensitized to scorch superficially in those parts closest to the hot skeleton? Check my 5 or 6 previous posts and you will find one possible method, using linen that had been lightly coated with charcoal slurry (maybe starch and/or simple sugars too) and then dried. The charcoal acts as a thermosensitizer, absorbing heat rays (infrared), producing a light tanning effect on the part of the cloth in immediate contact with the charcoal. The chemistry might involve caramelisation, or a carbohydrate/protein reaction to form Maillard reaction products). The latter can be washed out later, leaving just the sepia “stencil” and the bemused (overawed) medieval religious pilgrim with no clue as how it was produced. It’s a process that I have dubbed thermo stencilling. Alternatively, the cloth may simply have been impregnated with lemon juice or similar, relying on the old “invisible writing” trick we used to so as children with paper, lemon juice, a pen nib and a hot clothes iron. It was totally in the context of my first “scorch at a distance” model, one I called thermostencilling. To suggest that the current role seen for Maillard reactions in my latest flour imprinting model is derivative of someone else’s model, presumably Rogers’, though not specifically named, is simply not borne out by the facts. In fact it’s downright ludicrous, since my model depends on elevated temperatures of 200 degrees C and higher that are only relevant in the proposed scenario of a medieval modelling of an aged sweat imprint. I think a retraction is in order. If it stands, in spite of this corrective, then it’s yet another attack on both character and professionalism, albeit not quite as serious as a previous one from the same individual, having once accused me on this site of selecting/ distorting/ ignoring data that were inconvenient to my case.

Time then to take the gloves off re Raymond N. Rogers RIP and tell a few home truths about his professionalism, or rather lack thereof. Chemistry is an exact science, based on a precise nomenclature. When one says “starch” one means the macromolecular form of polymeric glucose, whether linear (amylose) or branched (amylopectin). When one refers to “crude starch” it is taken by a chemist to mean starch and some unspecified non starch impurities. When one refers to “starch fractions” it could mean anything, unless specified. When one tests a “starch impurity” coating hypothesis using commercial dextrins, one is not testing starch but sugary fragments of starch produced under laboratory conditions, like exposure to strong acids or enzymes, something that does not occur in nature, except by action of yeasts and other microorganisms. When one refers to “reducing sugars” , especially if starch derived, one has to demonstrate that starch has been degraded, with enzymes or acids. Fail to do that, and one is being totally unscientific. Raymond N. Rogers, chemical explosives expert, used the terms starch, crude starch, starch fractions, dextrins and reducing sugars INTERCHANGEABLY when attempting to promote his Maillard hypothesis. That was a travesty of chemistry, and a TOTAL ABUSE of chemical nomenclature. I realized as much within a week or two of entering Shroud research, but have tried to avoid criticizing “someone no longer around to defend himself”. Sorry, but as I say, the gloves are now off, thanks to the persistemt trolling on this site. Linked to those whom I regard as romanticizing Rogers “groupies”. When Rogers signed up to STURP he went ‘out of area’. He was a fine explosives chemist, of that I have no doubt. But he was a lousy carbohydrate chemist, and essentially misdirected Shroud research. His baleful influence can be seen and felt to this day, thanks to his misguided pro authenticity fan club employing their troll tactics. They frankly do not understand the basics of carbohydrate chemistry, being even more ignorant – or blissfully indifferent – than Raymond N.Rogers.

There would a tendency of flour to stick to the highest part of a wettened farbric anyway, since once wet it will tend to stay put and not migrate into the weave.

One possibility I guess is that he got cold feet at having to draw bare buttocks. If that were the case, then one could excuse him that prudishness (or cowardice) and conclude that overall the 1568 is highly derivative of the 1516, making precisely the same point, namely that the TS body image is (and always was) faint to the point of invisibility.

It’s not your ancient negatives that had the haunting character. Odd and unsatisfactory maybe, but not haunting. It’s what you see when you convert them back to their positives that is remarkable, had you been seeing the final positives for the first time. Now trurn that on its head. The TS image is NOT a positive. It’s a non photogenic negative. I It was Secondo Pia’s ‘inversion’ of light/dark that created the haunting image that no one had hitherto suspected was there. The reason for the haunting character of the Secondo Pia character is an entirely different question that has to be discussed separately. I’ve suggested previously that it’s something to do with the promotion of a lot of initial white space to dark space and vice versa. That kind of inversion does not occur with ordinary 19th/20th century light based photography. It’s a result of starting with a negative imprint produced by some kind of pre photography, maybe thermography (my preference) or as Dan suggests, Rogers’ ‘chemography’. Or maybe other kinds of ography; It’s the subtlety of the TS image , both as is, and the way it responds to modern technology that should have told you the TS was no ordinary image, certainly not painted.

Max, provided you accept an alchemist with a sideline in deep philosophical discourse. I refer to the 13th century (pseudo) Geber. Geber, who in his day was regarded as an alchemist, and thus viewed with deep disapproval by the Church, had used Geber as a pen name (it’s complicated, being an attempt it would appear to pose posthumously as an much earlier Arab alchemist). However, a strong case has been made for identifying the pseudo Geber as the Franciscan monk, Paul of Taranto. Geber/Paul are credited with the first clear recipe for generating nitric acid and accompanying oxides of nitrogen by calcining a mixture of metal nitrates and sulphates, initially in the form of fumes from the reaction vessel. I am coming round to the view that those fumes could have been used to produce the image we see on the Shroud – as oxidation products of carbohydrates – and possibly even nitrated products of protein (yellow xanthoproteic products can be formed by nitration of aromatic side chains of tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine).

I came to nitric acid through trying to think like a medieval forger, and considering what chemical reagents he might have had at his disposal. The first was sulphuric acid, which I rejected after experimentation: it fails to scorch linen unless hot and concentrated. That left two common mineral acids – nitric and hydrochloric. Only the first of those is strongly oxidizing in both dilute and concentrated solutions AND (importantly) in the cold too, albeit more slowly. What’s more, nitric acid is well known for yellowing organic matter. Reading the alchemical literature then reminded me that the first nitric acid of European history was generated in the13th century or earlier as fumes from a high temperature reaction in a heated retort loaded with nitrate and sulphate salts. So it’s pure accident that we’ve both arrived at fumigation. There’s also the small point that hypotheses are designed to be tested (or testable in principle).

I’m just trying to understand how the topical acid made it on to the linen. Max would be working from a similar premise but of course with an actual corpse. Could your theory likewise involve a corpse?” There’s a huge advantage of this chemical model over the previous “hot template” hypothesis, David G. It permits one to use a LIVE and COOPERATIVE human subject as template, rather like one of Luigi Garlaschelli’s student volunteers. (Or should that be ‘volunteers’ , given they had to consent to be stripped of clothing and fitted with false shoulder length hair?). That’s not to say it could not have been a more cooperative corpse. Why? One is looking here at a binary chemical system (think binary weapons that are safe to store in warheads until one allows the two ingredients to mix). The safe component is the two “paints” that one applies to the volunteer that is to represent blood and sweat (possibly real blood, but artificial sweat). The beauty of this binary system is that it allows one to apply sweat first, then blood, contrary to blood first/body image second claim of Adler and Heller. When one lays the linen over the subject and presses around the relief contours, it’s blood that imprints first, underneath the “sweat”. OK, one has one’s imprint on the linen. One can then tell the volunteer to get dressed and go back to his studies with improved exam prospects. One then takes the imprinted linen, maybe allowing a short time for partial drying, and one then suspends it in the HNO3/N Ox acid fumes. The latter acts on both the background linen to give a faint yellow/brown coloration, but more extensively on all the organic matter in one’s simulated sweat AND blood maybe. Result: Turin Shroud Mark 1. Ageing, wear and tear does the rest to make present TS Mark2. Who knows: the blood that is “too bright” might even be real blood that had reacted with nitric acid and nitrogen oxides. I suggested something similar with the “leech digested” blood hypothesis. Adrie van der Hoeven said the visible absorption spectrum was wrong, from her meticulous literature search, but a mix of HNO3 and N Ox offers a much wider range of bonding ligands onto that heme bound Fe+3 centre of acid methemoglobin. Note that it’s “acid” methemoglobin that was identified by Adler and Heller, as Piero has recently reminded us. Hmmm. Now where did the acid come from one wonders? Acids don’t appear out of thin air.

I’ve been out of the loop on clinical chemistry for some 20 years or more, so have to rely on Google to keep in touch.

NO supplementation is now therapeutic procedure, would you believe it, based on it having being found to be an endogenous regulator of vascular tone, blood pressure etc. So we now a highly fashionable form of NO therapy (“if a little does you good then more supplied by the therapist must work better”). Shame about the raised risk of methemoglobinemia. What’s this got to do with the TS you may ask? Those fumes from the Geber/Paul of Taranto retort are not just nitric acid. They are a mixture of nitrogen oxides as well, for which the umbrella term is N Ox (NO, N2 O,NO2, N2 O3, N2 O4, N2 O5 etc). One of them is probably NO, which would be able to convert any blood stains to oxidized methemoglobin, with or without assistance from HNO3.

This forms the principal portion of the commercial explosive gun cotton, and is made when a mixture of strong nitric acid and strong sulphuric acid is allowed to act on cotton at from 50 to 55° F. For twenty four hours. The longer the action is prolonged, the more completely is the cotton converted into the nitrate, with a short duration the finished product contains lower nitrates. This hexa nitrate is insoluble in ether, alcohol, or in a mixture of those solvents, likewise in glacial acetic acid or in methyl alcohol.” http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21224/21224 h/21224 h.htm Cotton then is amazingly resistant material, at least towards oxidation, its cellulose OH groups being esterified by nitric acid, instead of being oxidized to a brown char as one might imagine. How linen behaves is anyone’s guess, given that linen unlike cotton has a lot of reactive hemicelluloses. It or its passengers may be more susceptible to oxidation and yellowing, bearing in mind that it probably carries a considerable burden of impurities from the retting process – bacteria etc – so there may be adventitious surface components that ARE oxidized by nitric acid to yellow or brown products that one would not see with much purer seed hair cotton.

The hypochlorite starts bleaching straight away, but it might take 20 30 minutes to complete for the darker imprints. Incidentally, I see from Heller’s book that he tested 30% hydrogen peroxide, stressing how dangerous it was. I’m beginning to think he never tested plain old bleach at all, the kind we keep under our kitchen sinks, bleach being oh so commonplace and 19th century! I’ve scarcely begun to examine the imprints in detail. Reason:Who’s interested in the answers? Not here they are not. There’s far more kudos to be gained here by pointedly declaring these imprints look nothing like the “Shroud”. Never mind that the know alls in question have never ever seen the Shroud, merely photoenhanced pictures of something that is near invisible unless one stands a metre or two away. Best methinks to postpone further research, and choose a better time to share results, recognizing that one’s modelling cannot hope to reproduce the effect of centuries of ageing and probably more besides. Pyrographs? Well they require a higher temperature of course, and risk coming with the dreaded fluorescence, and as scientist Barrie M.Schwortzis is ever quick to remind us, any fluoresence immediately disproves the model.

It’s true that the oxidizing action of hypoochlorite is ascribed to the hypochlorite ion (O Cl ). But one’s nose tells one that there’s free chlorine present as well (one would not expect to smell the involatile hypochlorite ion). So it’s possible, indeed probable, that one can have oxidation AND chlorination going on at the same time. Now oxidation is not the way to bleach “Shroud” image fibres, as judged by seeing no effect with hydrogen peroxide, even at 30% concentration. I strongly suspect that the bleaching we see here, and which MIGHT have been seen if hypochlorite had been tested (?) by STURP, is due to chlorination. Mechanism? Diimide “uniquely” (?) was found to bleach “Shroud” fibres. Diimide is said to be highly selective in its action, destroying chromophores that have conjugated double bonds by converting them to saturated single bonds: CH=CH – + NH=NH > CH2 CH2 + N2 (gas). I propose that hypochlorite bleach does the equivalent, using chlorine instead of hydrogen: CH=CH – + Cl Cl (from bleach) > – CH(Cl) – CH(Cl) – That’s not to say you haven’t got oxidation occuring elsewere, in the same or different molecules, but it’s the saturation of double bonds that results in bleaching, and oh boy is it fast and efficient (in my model systems).

Until recently I’d assumed that the two stage imprinting model, using a real person as template, flour paste as imprinting medium, and any one of at least 3 developing agents, was entirely original thinking. Not so: here’s what John Heller wrote towards the end of his 1983 book (well written ,except for the flyleaf that he hopefully did not see and approve): “Sam Pellicori, a champion of the body contact hypothesis, had done some interesting experiments. In three separate experiments, he had placed oil, lemon juice and perspiration on his fingers. Then he placed linen on top of his hand and pressed it gently to his flesh. He then placed the cloth samples in an oven at low temperature to produce an accelerated aging effect. In each case there was indeed a yellowing of the contact area. He had brought the linen samples with him. The team examined them and, although there was a surface effect, several of us insisted that we could see some capillarity in several of the fibrils, which is not the case of the Shroud.” My experiments match those of Pellicori’s almost down to the last detail, but with one crucial difference. My imprinting medium is macromolecular, indeed whole cell in size, namely the crushed endosperm of wheat grains (“white flour”) so greatly reducing the theoretical risk of “capillarity”, though I still have to do detailed microscopy. If this model is only approximately corrrect (and it’s gratifying to know that Pellicori, a STURP team investigator was thinking along exactly the same lines 30 years ago) then the science and technology were well within the capability of a medieval forger if needing only white flour paste and a hot iron or oven (not nitric acid as initially suggested). What’s more there’s a clearly stated rationale for doing it the way suggested – namely to simulate an ancient sweat imprint left on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen/sindon en route from cross to tomb, pre empting any notions of fancier imaging mechanisms (laser uv light, neutrons etc) occuring on winding(?) cloths/othonia much later, or due to miraculous events that are non reproducible in the laboratory – and thus a scientific dead end, no pun intended. This blogger does not do scientific dead ends, and places great emphasis on having a coherent narrative from start to finish. But the technical details – like ringing all the changes with imprinting technique, oven temperatures etc – he prefers to leave to others. What concerns me is scientific feasibility – not reproducing every tiny detail of the Shroud image. There’s no compelling need to re forge a forgery. One need only show that the science is feasible and credible, requiring no lasers etc. Naturally, I can only speak for myself. I can’t speak for those convinced that the Shroud is beyond known science..","date":"2015-08-05","mins":"5:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/05/scientist-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"article","title":"Scientist Barrie Schwortz"},{"id":"comment-207765","author":"colin_berry","post":"PS: have just been reminded of another more direct mechanism by which free hypochlorous acid (of which there will be some even in alkaline bleach as part of an acid/.base equilibrium) reacts directly with double bonds in alkenes and other organic compounds to form chlorhydrins: – CH = CH – + HO Cl > – CH(OH) – CH(Cl) – Only one chlorine is inserted via this mechanism, but the effect on a coloured substance in which the chromophore depends on conjugated double bonds would be the same – bleaching..","date":"2015-08-08","mins":"3:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/05/scientist-barrie-schwortz/","cat":"article","title":"Scientist Barrie Schwortz"},{"id":"comment-208140","author":"colin_berry","post":"But the bleaching action of hypochlorite is quick ( a few minutes in most cases) piero. So why bother with a side by side comparison? It’s hard to imagine diimide being any faster, but even if it was, then so what? There are so many factors affecting chemical kinetics that it’s hard to see what point is served. What matters is the principle. Did STURP overlook to test hypochlorite? Would hypochlorite ave bleached the “Shroud” image? If so, what conclusions might have been drawn (e.g. That would quickly exclude Mc Crone’s tunnel vision – due to his over reliance on a microscope to mis identify iron oxide as the chromophore) and whether there might have been an opening, hitched onto Ray Rogers’ know how with pyrolysis mass spectrometry to explore the nature of the “Shroud” chromophore (admittedly destructive)? Might it be something other than the supposed dehydration of carbohydrates? The half tone effect (if true) suggests an all or nothing action on a minor constituent of linen, as does the strong absorption in the uv that might account for coloration seen with Di Lazzaro’s intense laser generated uv. Is he right to assume it’s cellulose being coloured, given that’s a bulk component, generally regarded as transparent or unaffected by uv? Cue Hugh’s suggestion on this site, November 2012, that lignin may be the susceptible chromophore. Lignin absorbs and bleaches in the uv and visible spectrum. My money’s on the lignin. I might try doing some experiments with sodium metabisulphite to see if that blocks certain modes of linen coloration (bisulphite is used in paper manufacture from wood pulp to solubilize or otherwise deal with lignin).

Having the unusual, some might say arresting head to head configuration on the same narrow length of linen makes it clearer surely that one is looking at a double imprinting of the same man. One could go further and say that the TS head to head configuration is one of its iconic features. I can’t recall ever having seen it elsewhere.

The head to head configuration was an important cue that one was looking at the ‘real’ (if faked) J of A linen, not some timid artistic re creation.

If that’s Nicodemus, then note that he’s not carrying a “winding sheet” or 100lbs of aloes etc. They would have been delivered to the tomb, and used (probably) after J of A’s linen had been removed for final cleaning of the body, application of spices, ointments etc. Sorry to have to repeat myself, but there’s really no biblical evidence to support the view that J of A’s linen was used or intended as a final burial shroud – quite the contrary in fact from the account in John. Ipso facto the Turin Shroud is not a shroud either.

Why do folk continue to deploy such terms, as if the existence of a modern day parallel makes the TS image an anachronism? The image is photograph like (but only after tone reversal as per Secondo Pia ) and arguably x ray like too in places, but that’s as far as it goes. Why? Because there are easy ways of demonstrating those properties that require neither light nor x rays. Push one’s face into pillow and one sees a temporary indentation that is a transient image of oneself (and it’s a negative). One can make that a faint but permanent image by first smearing one’s face with oil. One can develop that image further by finding something that attaches preferentially to the oil imprint. Soot, i.e. Fine particles of carbon might do, as in dusting for fingerprints. Repeat the exercise with one’s fingers and they may well appear bony, and “x ray like” if light pressure is used when pushing into the pillow. That’s because of the central hard non compressible bone and the curvature of thin overlying flesh. This is not modern photography or modern anything. It’s simple image making technology (“impactography”? )that could have been employed in medieval times, in biblical rimes, or arguably even in the Stone Age for that matter..","date":"2015-05-15","mins":"1:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/13/too-great-to-be-a-work-of-art/","cat":"article","title":"Too Great to Be a Work of Art"},{"id":"comment-199021","author":"colin_berry","post":"As this blogger has said previously on this site, there was in fact a credibility seeking ‘w’indow of opportunity’ for the linen, but not as a burial shroud (nowhere does it say in the NT that Joseph of Arimathea’s linen was used or intended as such, quite the contrary in fact viz.John). It was for receiving the body straight from the cross for transport to tomb. Even if the latter were very close, the need for respectful and discreet transport may well have been what motivated J of A to provide fine linen. Once one accepts or concedes the fact that the ‘shroud’ was not a burial shroud, but an impromptu stretcher, and indeed an up and over ‘body bag’ (if you will pardon the term) then straight away all the difficulties re wounds that re open or clots that have to retract to release a serum exudate disappear immediately. The thought experiment that inspired the TS pictured the blood as still reasonably fresh, even if it was stretching credulity a little to imagine it was unclotted(especially as regards the earlier scourge marks). Body image? The use of linen to envelop a recently crucified corpse, one that leaves a negative imprint (as distinct from positive portrait), and one moreover with the double image interpretable immediately as a whole body IMPRINT, should surely support the notion that the image was meant to to be seen by relic seeking pilgrims as one formed by bodily perspiration, aka sweat. The concept of imprinting the body, or part of it, onto cloth had already been made familiar by the then fabled Veil of Veronica, Rome’s prize exhibit in the mid 14th century according to the recently retired Director of the British Museum. For further fleshing out details, see the 16 point summary of my two step imprinting/chemical development model, placed this morning on my specialist TS site. Https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/modelling the turin shroud forged in the 14th century as a white flour imprint onto linen then chemically developed with nitric acid to resemble ancient yellowed sweat/ I am now minded to think that the (alleged) peculiar shade of the TS sepia image represents nitrated aromatic amino acid side chains on gluten storage protein in white flour used as imprinting medium. There’s one reference, still to be cross checked, that says that nitrated tyrosine side groups of wheat gluten are yellow, while nitrated tryptophan residues are red. Might the TS image be a mixture of the two, not necessarily in equal proportions? My nitration experiment yesterday with isolated wheat gluten produced an orange, rather than yellow product. I must try and dig out the reflectance spectra referred to in the STURP summary, and see how they compare with nitrated aromatic amino acids versus the claimed ‘dehydrated, oxidized, conjugated’ carbohydrates of linen. Nitric acid had scarcely any effect on the starch fraction separated from the same white flour, and a slight weakening and discoloration only of the linen, possibly due to attack on the lignin. That might account for Rogers’ finding less potential vanillin than expected for a 700 year artefact, and Fanti’s finding of mechanical weakening similarly greater than expected were the radiocarbon dated age to be taken at face value..","date":"2015-05-13","mins":"8:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/13/too-great-to-be-a-work-of-art/","cat":"article","title":"Too Great to Be a Work of Art"},{"id":"comment-199222","author":"colin_berry","post":"The crucial point surely is that there is no imaging of “wounds” or “injuries” as such on the sepia body image of the TS – absolutely none.

Even the “scourge marks” showing the dumb bell shapes etc of skin lacerating or indenting metal or bone tips are (we’re told) solely blood imprints – there’s no corroborating evidence in the body image. The reliance on bloodstains alone to support the biblical narrative (scourging, crown of thorns, nails wounds, lance wound) with no supporting evidence whatsoever in the body image is entirely consistent with medieval forgery. Indeed, it’s hard to think of an alternative explanation – unless one’s view of the TS is “authentic until proven otherwise” (an authenticity endorsing or promoting ‘sindonological’ position, as distinct from one that is strictly neutral, dispassionately scientific)..","date":"2015-05-15","mins":"1:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/13/too-great-to-be-a-work-of-art/","cat":"article","title":"Too Great to Be a Work of Art"},{"id":"comment-199154","author":"colin_berry","post":"Right.

It’s to do with the burden of proof. When someone is flayed with a Roman flagrum, one expects to see the skin ripped to shreds, with blood flows to match. One does not expect to see neat imprints correspondingly exactly with the shape of the metal or bone pellets, as if all they did was to produce contusions with just the right amount of weeping blood to “imprint” an image, with no surplus to obscure and thus ‘spoil’ the image.

There’s just one more posting that needs doing. It’s to generalize my currently preferred white flour/nitric acid model. It may or may not have been white flour used as imprinting medium. It may or may not have been nitric acid that was used to turn that faint off white image into a more prominent yellow or yellow brown colour. The key thing is the use of a two stage model: initial imprinting of a proto (‘ghost’) image followed by second stage development. Note the parallel with pre digital era photography, except my model is maybe better described as a mix of medieval impactography and chemography – no photons or neutrons needed. Why use two stages, when one would suffice (e.g.Garlaschelli’s frottage or Accetta’s wood block imprinting)? Answer: to permit fine tuning of the end result, so as to achieve that oh so subtle negative image – not too contrasty, not too ghostly. For example, a first stage imprint with flour could be softened around the edges by sponging with a damp cloth. The permutations are endless when one adopts a two stage model.

From: St Francis de Sales, Annecy 1614 “Whilst waiting to see you, my very dear Mother, my soul greets yours with a thousand greetings. May God fill your whole soul with the life and death of His Son Our Lord! At about this time, a year ago, I was in Turin, and, while pointing out the Holy Shroud among such a great crowd of people, a few drops of sweat fell from my face on to this Holy Shroud itself. Whereupon, our heart made this wish: May it please You, Saviour of my life, to mingle my unworthy sweat with Yours, and let my blood, my life, my affections merge with the merits of Your sacred sweat ! My very dear Mother, the Prince Cardinal was somewhat annoyed that my sweat dripped onto the Holy Shroud of my Saviour; but it came to my heart to tell him that Our Lord was not so delicate, and that He only shed His sweat and His blood for them to be mingled with ours, in order to give us the price of eternal life. And so, may our sighs be joined with His, so that they may ascend in an odour of sweetness before the Eternal Father. But what am I going to recall? I saw that when my brothers were ill in their childhood, my mother would make them sleep in a shirt of my father’s, saying that the sweat of fathers was salutary for children. Oh, may our heart sleep, on this holy day, in the Shroud of our divine Father, wrapped in His sweat and in His blood; and there may it be, as if at the very death of this divine Saviour, buried in the sepulchre, with a constant resolution to remain always dead to itself until it rises again to eternal glory. We are buried, says the Apostle, with Jesus Christ in death here below, so that we may no more live according to the old life, but according to the new. Amen.” Now while I hesitate to mention it (for the 27th time) sweat, or rather a contact imprint of what ancient degraded sweat might look like, i.e. A yellowish brown discoloration corresponding with just the highest contours of the face and body to leave what we now call a negative image, is NOT too difficult to simulate (I hesitate to say forge). Any scepticism on the part of the first cohort of foot sore pilgrims exiting the hastily constructed Lirey church could have been countered with mention of the fabled Veil of Veronica, a smaller scale “sweat imprint”. As I said before, I believe the Shroud was an attempt to trump aka leapfrog the crowd pulling power of a precursor “sweat imprint”, cleverly exploiting precedent to build instant credibility (the double image doing the rest). There’s one caveat – namely that the technology developed to produce the first(?) full body representation of the Man on the LS had to be kept a well guarded secret if the narrative was to get established in the popular imagination, not just of pilgrims, but the wider world. That’s where the Lirey badge played a key role in spreading the message before the arrival of social media sites. The addition of that small representation of what is almost certainly the Veil of Veronica, above the word SUAIRE (see Machy Mould) has to be seen as a marketing master stroke…..","date":"2014-07-28","mins":"6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"id":"comment-140844","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thomas: “I’ve never personally thought the lack of earlier written record is necessarily problematic. Remember a number centuries passed where images of Christ were considered sacriligious. Records may have been destroyed. And there are several written records that hint of the shroud, if not providing strong and indisputable evidence” OK, but it’s a separate issue from the one I personally find fascinating, namely how something billed as THE genuine burial Shroud could suddenly appear in a tiny French village, in a recently built church (reportedly a modest wooden structure to start with), be given such an introductory fanfare (think Lirey pilgrims’ badge), yet there’s not a single written word about its history in the immediate years leading up to 1357. That speaks, does it not, of what some might think a military style operation, conducted under tight security, and it comes as no surprise to learn that the Lord of Lirey was a highly regarded warrior knight.

There’s also a brief mention of the Lirey badge, but nothing about the trellis pattern on the reverse side. Yes, trellis, the one I thought was a barbecue for the slow roasting of Templars, or latterly even St.Lawrence of Rome.

In that situation the backing material is canvas, keeping the race to perfection strictly within the confines of art. But the TS image is NOT purely within the confines of art, because it’s on linen, not canvas. It was not intended to be seen simply as an artistic representation of Jesus, but as a kind of facsimile copy, captured in the first few hours or days after crucifixion, in other words, not just an icon, but a holy relic So any attempt to replicate the TS image ran the real risk of being viewed not as artistic competition, but as an attempt to replace one “genuine relic” with an “even more genuine” one.

The human eye is very good at looking at images and reading into the detail so as to draw conclusions, sound or otherwise, as to the implied antecedents. If one showed a person an image of a sandwich with a semi circular area missing from the edge, one would reasonably conclude that a bite had been taken out, even though other explanations are theoretically possible. The first pilgrims to view the TS at Lirey did something similar , and while no doubt guided in what to see, they could have figured it out for themselves – a length of linen, a double image with just a small gap between the two heads, the naked man. They were able to deduce a provenance, namely that the linen was a burial shroud that had somehow captured an image, and a peculiar one at that, perhaps better described as an imprint, possibly in sweat as per crowd pulling Veil of Veronica, even if the concept of negative v positive images was unlikely to have been around in the mid 14th century. It’s because the imprint tells its own story (whether contrived or not) that we have (I consider) an explanation for a second facet of the TS enigma, namely that the Lirey Shroud went onto to become the fabled Turin Shroud without there being a single written word as to its history prior to 1357 – not even for the period when it was presumably in the possession of Geoffroi de Charny and/or his wife, later widow. How many people today would attend an exhibition of a “newly unearthed” item of historical significance, if there weren’t a single word of corroborating evidence? As I say, it’s the ability of the TS to tell it’s own story, requiring no more than elementary pattern finding skills, that probably explains the readiness of those early pilgrims to embrace its “message”, suspending or abandoning their critical faculties, despite the gaping hole in pre 1357 provenance. Modern photography and science did the rest, with over hyped TV documentaries focused on the alleged uniqueness of this or that detail (superficiality, 3 D enhancibility etc etc) As for the question posed in the blog: all it’s doing, or should be doing, is reminding us of the dual enigma that is the TS. Sure, it’s a peculiar image – a one off one might say. But the extraordinary secrecy that surrounded the TS in its early days is why it’s somewhat pointless to ask why there’s only one. That was the dual intention – not just to create a unique image, but to ensure as far as humanly possible that it remained unique. I’ll spare you my views, published at length elsewhere, re a possible Templar connection, or Barbara Frales’s evidence that the Templars had some kind of fixation with a life size image of a bearded man on linen, used in secret initiation rites. But let’s not get bogged down in contentious detail. The crucial issue is the appearance of the TS suddenly, out of the blue with instant celebrity status. It is the question of its early 14th century history (or rather lack thereof) that needs addressing first, before asking why there’s only one TS. Who’s to say there weren’t a number of prototypes in Lirey or elsewhere, quickly disposed of once the imprinting technology had been perfected?.","date":"2014-07-27","mins":"3:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"id":"comment-140984","author":"colin_berry","post":"…does not that reference to the sweat of Christ on the Shroud lend some basis to the theory that much earlier references to a sweaty mandylion image were referring to the shroud? It might, Thomas, but that would be to lose sight of the distinction between the ‘original’ alleged relic on linen, and the numerous representations of it on canvas that took progressively greater liberties with reality, causing confusion in the collective medieval mind. One has only to look at the wiki entry on the Veil of Veronica to see the problem. One starts with an alleged sweat imprint on fabric, with any number of those claiming to be the real “Veil” (which of course is a matter of legend with no biblical backing). You then get works of art on canvas in which there is less and less attempt to represent a negative imprint. Instead the images become indistinguishable from life like painted portraits (‘positive’ images needless to say). Presumably the sceptics were told that it wasn’t just anyone’s sweat imprint, but that of Jesus, so had superior supernatural characteristics. In fact there’s a reference making clear that Jesus’s crucifixion sweat could be assumed to have special image forming properties: Here, from Pam Moon (my bolding) http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud of Turin exhibition/Constantinople 1 L shaped Holes files/The%20 Shroud%20and%20the%20 Skylitzes%20final%20website 3.pdf “The Holy Mandylion arrived in Constantinople from Edessa on 15th August 944, in the last year of Romanos I’s reign. On August 16th it was carried in a casket around the city and taken to Hagai Sophia. At the cathedral the Archdeacon Gregory, preached a sermon in which he said the Holy Mandylion showed ‘the drops of sweat from the agony [from Gethsemene] which flowed from [Christ’s] face like drops of blood but also ‘blood and water’ [haima kai hudor] from his very side. From this we can deduce the Mandylion was not just a face image. Ian Wilson has argued convincingly for many years that the Holy Mandylion was the Shroud of Turin.” But what has all this to do with the TS, I hear you say, which is a negative imprint, not a proper portrait? Yes, but it’s scarcely conceivable that it was a real sweat imprint. It has sufficient detail to make one suspect that someone set out to create an simulated sweat image that would look better than any real life, non miraculous sweat imprint, but not too good, too portrait like, one that could then score both on credibility “(it’s a supernaturally enhanced sweat imprint, stoopid”) AS WELL AS on what today we would call photogenic appeal. So, to answer your question: “does not that reference to the sweat of Christ on the Shroud lend some basis to the theory that much earlier references to a sweaty mandylion image were referring to the shroud?” It’s almost certainly the other way round: progressively hyped up versions in art of the ‘sweaty mandylion image’, ones that evolved over centuries, creating a skewed reference point in Western art, helped to ensure that the “newly discovered” Lirey Shroud seemed by contrast to be more conservative, more subtle, more understated, more instantly credible. Thus was skilfully engineered a pre emptive strike that ensured there was only ONE genuine long lost Shroud, and that no one in their right mind would dare challenge its authenticity, far less attempt to produce a superior “more genuine” version..","date":"2014-07-29","mins":"1:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"id":"comment-140826","author":"colin_berry","post":"One needs to distinguish between (a) a lack of written record which extends over 13 centuries, and which some might consider stretches credulity somewhat where a1st century provenance is concerned, and (b) a lack of written record between (say) 1300 and 1357.

Yes, there is a role for engineers, especially instrumentation engineers in Shroud research. But let’s not lose sight of the fundamental distinction between scientist and engineer. The first is concerned with ideas, hypotheses, theories etc, so has to be scrupulously careful about bias. The second is concerned primarily with practical applications of science, so on the face of it should not need to be so concerned on that score. But instrumentalists who discover a use for their ‘black boxes’ in solving particular scientific problems can get drawn in, and then slip by degrees into the role of scientist, which is OK, provided they know the pitfalls of bias and maintain self discipline. But how much of the latter (self discipline) can one expect from someone like our mechanical engineer turned author who thinks it’s OK to tack theological sections on the end of his conference papers, and who thinks he sees wound sites on the linen (wounds, not blood) where there are none, and highlights them in yellow, just in case folk fail to spot them? Or who claims to be able to see a time sequence in the different types of scourge mark despite the latter being imaged as blood – not as discernible lesions on the body image (skin indentations, cuts, tears, lacerations etc) And let me ask you this. Suppose the radiocarbon dating had returned a date for the linen of 20 BC to 86 AD. Suppose I had come along and said that the result was not to be trusted, because atom bomb testing had made the C 14 transmute rather than decay to C 12 at a faster than expected rate and that the statistics were wrong anyway, making the real age more likely to be 1260 to 1390. What do you think would be the response of the Fantis of this world? Would they have given me a fair hearing, and if so, how long would that have lasted – measured to the nearest femtosecond? Some might think that the “wrong” radiocarbon dating should at least have been an occasion for a little thought and humility, for maybe less speculation about corona discharges etc. And more about imaging via conventional physics (conduction, convection and electromagnetic radiation).

If one assumes the data are from a normal distribution about the mean (one really has no option but to) and that 95% of the data points would lie between +/ 1.645 standard deviations from the mean, then the minimum date would be 443 AD or rather the probability of it being 443 or greater is 95%, the conventional level for statistical confidence.

Having said that, how anyone could stand in front a group of strangers and say what he did by way of introduction is quite the most extraordinary thing I have ever read as regards the conference circuit – this passage in particular. “In order to get out of the research dead end, I think it is essential now to go beyond the “pro and anti coin on eye” dichotomy. One must be fully aware that those who claim the ability to identify the presence or the absence of coin impressions left on the Shroud (a theologian, a psychiatrist, a medical doctor, an amateur scholar of numismatics or coin collector, a technical photographer, a church historian, a mathematician, a linguist, a lawyer, a laser physicist or engineer for instance) are definitely not the best qualified Shroud researchers to analyze and/or cryptanalyze ancient images and inscriptions. How can anyone of them turn into a professional numismatist, an archaeological analyst or cryptanalyst overnight? It does take extensive data analysis and/or cryptanalysis before you acquire the proper eye and brain. Without such a trained eye and brain for forms, how can a non specialist, credibly discriminate between misspelling, misreading and non univocal forms; between mere “figures in clouds” and genuine palaeographic information embedded in visual background noise and random shapes?” I can think of some conferences I’ve attended where the audience atttendees have clearly taken quickly against a speaker, but usually managed to restrain themselves until the paper is read, and then thrown open to discussion. But if anyone had ever read that obnoxious putdown of oh so may disparate individuals and groups thereof, they would have been met with an immediate intake of breath, of furious head shaking, of noisily consulting neighbours, rustling of papers, walk outs even. It has to be quite the most conceited piece of conference self promotion I have ever encountered, and at some venues he would not have been able to proceed for all the hissing, booing and catcalls that would have come from the audience, Professors included (the capital P is intentional). That’s fully accredited University Professors, you realize – Heads of Department, acknowledged experts in their field with mountains of published findings in peer reviewed journals – not the narcissistic attention seeker poseur that is Max Patrick Hamon, someone who would have us all believe that he was himself a University professor between 1976 and 1978.

Wouldn’t blood on the coins be deemed an insult to those in the spirit world for whom the coins were intended?

Returning to an earlier point re the claimed or obligatory role of blood as imprinting medium (“printers’ ink”): As I indicated earlier, it is actually not difficult for folk to do their own discrimination test (blood v non blood image) and to decide for themselves whether there is blood on the eyes/eyelids, regardless of whether the “decals” constitute lettering. Here’s a no nonsense way of judging for oneself if blood spots, small enough to allow “lettering”, but big enough to be seen, are present in the centre of those eye sockets. Go to Mario Latendresse’s Shroud Scope (use the face only option under Base Layer in blue panel on right for best resolution) http://www.sindonology.org/shroud Scope/shroud Scope.shtml Centre your laptop screen on the eye region. Stay centred while one moves the slide up to optimum magnification for one’s screen size. Do a screen grab to MS Paint or another image capturing program with reasonable toolbar. Crop the image to get both of the eyes and some of the bloodstains on the forehead. Then increase the contrast by degrees to its maximum value. Adjust brightness as necessary. You should see something interesting happen. A difference in colour density aka saturation should be immediately obvious when comparing blood and non blood areas. Blood is much, much denser than non blood. What’s more, the blood stains have a colour that might be described as ‘plum’ when viewed, especially at lower magnification. Elsewhere the colour is one of various shades/hues between tan and red brown. It is not apparent where MPH got his description of blood as having any kind of carmine tint, at least on photographic images. I see no carmine, but that may be because of the increase in contrast used to discriminate between blood and non blood. The initial coloration of the Shroud Scope images, uniformly monochromatic (purplish hue) resolves into two different colours – a yellowish brown for body image (skin, eyebrows etc) and a quite different coloration for the major bloodstains – dense reddish brown with a pinkish. purple hue in lower intensity regions of the blood. (I have previously interpreted the heterogeneity as flaking off of blood leaving that pinkish background but one can take that or leave it). Now look at the eyes. The first impression is that there is little pigmentation or image in the eyes, relative to bloodstains. Such little as there is seems more like body image than bloodstain. There is no obvious spotting or micro spotting of blood, even at these top magnifications. (Oh, and the impression of two eyelids in apposition – giving rise to the “closed eye” look seems to be due to an irregularity in the weave of just one of the eyes.) I personally fail to see how anyone could claim to see blood “decals” when looking at the high resolution Shroud Scope pictures. The latter are of course from Durante’s 2002 digital takes, minimally processed “as is”, not light/dark reversed negatives, as distinct from Pia/Enrie type legacy silver grain analogues, with attendant risk of artefacts, especially if the images have since been tweaked digitally or by other means to “best show up” the alleged blood and coins. All Shroud photographs should carry a health message, especially those that show coins, lettering, flowers etc: “Warning, this image may trick your visual cortex into seeing things that are not really there.”.","date":"2013-06-25","mins":"1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/23/paper-chase-max-patrick-hamon-on-the-coin-on-eye-issue/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: Max Patrick Hamon on the Coin-on-Eye Issue"},{"id":"comment-38059","author":"colin_berry","post":"Bravo.

Here’s a photograph from a posting I did from Sep 30 last year that gives a clue to the potential of incorporating a familiar substance (lemon juice) into linen. I had confirmed a hunch about lemon juice as early as spring 2012, through hypothesizing that the “invisible ink” trick might allow imaging at lower temperatures, and possibly creating a more superficial image if the the latter were on a thin coating rather than the linen fibres per se. At the time it seemed that the active ingredients would be citric acid, or glucose, or maybe both in concert, but when I failed to reproduce the invisible ink effect with that mixture I went off and sulked for two years. Finally I forced myself to do some reading and learned of a different explanation for the lemon juice effect. Heat degrades the ascorbic acid of citrus fruits to the 4 carbon aldose sugar threose, which then gives a Maillard reaction with the epsilon amino groups of lysine residues in proteins. One can replace the lemon juice with white flour and get similar thermal sensitization of linen such that is scorches at a lower temperature, producing a fuzzy edge image reminiscent of the Shroud. So, Maillard reactions are one way of sensitizing linen to thermal imprinting, but there may be others that we don’t know about. PS Are you aware TH that wikipedia’s brief reference to my scorch studies was excised a short time ago, on the grounds that it has not appeared in a recognized peer reviewed journal. Meanwhile your pdf is still there, claiming that contact scorches always lack subtle tone contrasts. That was despite yours being similarly unrefereed (and as it happens totally untrue).

The average score for A=1, B= 2, C=3 etc is 13, the midpoint of the alphanet. So the typical sum for a 13 letter phrase is 13×13 i.e. 169, which becomes 1014 when each score is multiplied by 6 (as per Gematria score system).

I somehow managed to miss your Gematria in the course of learning and teaching maths and statistcis, so was intrigued to find how it works. This is somewhat tentative, but I think it’s to do with there being a large number of letters in the English alphabet, 26 no less, and the relatively random distribution of the most and least frequent letters used in most English scripts. Http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003 2004/cryptography/subs/frequencies.html The reason it works with such amazing coincidence is probably due to inputting phrases with a sizeable number of letters, e.g. “shroud of turin” with 13 (half the alphabet, ignoring repetitions). That means that the sums of the letter values, multiplied by 6, add up to a sum total that falls within a fairly narrow range of values. All that’s needed to get that magic 1128 is to tweak here and there, changing one 5 letter word, say, for a synonym that has a slightly different sum. Sorry to disillusion you, but that’s probability and statistics for you – the larger the number of “draws” the greater the averaging effect..","date":"2015-08-03","mins":"2:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/29/barrie-schwortz-on-catholic-radion-indy/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"Barrie Schwortz on Catholic Radio Indy"},{"id":"comment-207375","author":"colin_berry","post":"You’re letting yourself be bamboozled by a clever way of demonstrating the Law of Averages Dave. That became quickly obvious to this killjoy sceptic yesterday with that last example of yours (which I took for testing on account of your “grey area” rider).: 33. Named Jesus Christ=1128 (Not much grey area in that last one) The very first test I did was to replace “named” with a word that means the same (“”called”), and guess what? Both “named” and “called” score exactly the same, i.e. 222. Actually, there’s a bit of luck there, given there’s only 5 versus 6 letters in each. But the coincidence was sufficient to get me wondering why. It’s nothing to do with the age or importance of a language. It’s mainly to do with having a large number of letters in an alphabet and a fairly random distribution of the least/most frequently used letters. That’s the input from probability and statistics. But there’s another input that is more subtle, one that comes with choice of words for testing the system. By choosing a phrase that has something to do with Christianity, Jesus, the Shroud (pre Sabbath variety of course, not intended for final interment) good, evil etc you are ensuring that there’s a rich vocabulary from which to write all those variants for testing. You could achieve the same in a more secular way by choosing “The vehicle crashed into the garden wall” and again you have lots of variants, but if you had “He was like a bear with a sore head” you find you quickly run out of alternative ways of saying it (“she was like a coyote with an itchy paw” doesn’t quite do the business, does it?). The trick for making an impression, especially on the always open to new ideas super impressionable, is to choose a synonym friendly way for selling the Gematria message that there’s hidden magic at work in an otherwise boring old world. But there are other ways of making the world less boring – which is not to take everything one reads on trust, and to suss out for oneself how the mind control fraternity is able get away with their recruitment strategies through exploiting and weaponizing the oddities of maths and statistics.

If someone has seen evidence specifically for calcium carbonate, then let them speak now. I for one am not paying upfront charges on the off chance that the evidence one seeks is there. Relatedly, In Heller and Adler’s 1981 paper, in Canadian Society of Forensics Science Journal, in discussing the process of converting flax to linen, retting, it says, “During this process the natural ion exchange properties of cellulose operate and two ions found commonly in natural waters that most strongly bind in this way are Ca and Fe, with the former being more strongly bound, as reflected in the relative concentrations seen in the X ray and present studies.”” Nope. Cellulose is not an ion exchanger, having no electrically charged groups. Its use as a chromatography solid support depends on physical adsorption, not ion exchange. As put to Charles late last year (no reply!) the association between linen and calcium probably depends mainly on the pectin content (negative uronic acid derived anions) and that is weakened as a result of retting, given the latter results in extensive microbial digestion of the middle lamellar pectins. Charles is simply not entitled to equate calcium with calcium carbonate unless he can supply HARD evidence to back up that view.

One of the difficulties in evaluating alternative hypotheses is that we don’t know for certain how the image we see today compares with the one that existed (say) 600 years ago. Was it darker?

I really have nothing authoritative to say regarding image superficiality at the fibre level, Louis. But then, nor does anyone else still living that I’m aware of. “Sindonology” is still intoning its 200 600nm mantra, based on nothing more than NEGATIVE 35 year old evidence from Rogers’ light microscopy of stripped image ‘ghosts’ left on adhesive tape. Entire reviews have since been written on image superficiality at the macroscopic v microscopic level with absolutely no new experimental evidence whatsoever to back up that much touted 200 600nm ‘guesstimate’. All we’re told is that the figure for image thickness can be rationalized by supposing the image is confined the primary cell wall (PCW) of the flax fibre. Fair enough. But why then are image fibres more brittle than non image ones. If the image were really as superficial as claimed, then why should the strength of the entire fibre be compromised by a little chemical modification on the outermost part of the fibre which has virtually no crystalline cellulose, the latter providing the legendary strength and mechanical resistance of plant fibres? My hunch is that the image is not nearly as superficial as claimed, that the damage is not confined to the PCW, that the core of the fibres is affected too, in a way that was not detected by Rogers’ criterion of crystalline order, i.e preservation of birefringence under crossed polaroids lenses etc. Maybe there was melting and partial re crystallization, i.e. ‘retrogradation’ to secondary crystallites as suggested to me once by Adrie van der Hoeven. Or there again, let’s not forget that the cores of the flax fibres are not 100% cellulose. There are matrix components too – the non cellulosic polysaccharides (hemicelluloses, pectins etc). Maybe that ground substance became at least partially degraded too on image imprinting, in which case the fibre is no longer an intact composite material if the ground substance in which the cellulose fibres are embedded becomes significantly compromised. Composite materials depend not only on the strength of their fibres, but on their subtle interactions with anchoring ground substance too. The latter allowing a little “give” on stretching, distortion etc. But operating on a Goldilock’s principle – not too little, not too much. I hope that helps. No?

It is NOT “reasonable” that medieval artists should show the base of the cross if the linen was merely intended to be deployed in the tomb as the final ‘perishable’ burial garments as described in John. Why not? Because the final burial garment, seen by few eyes, and destined for rapid deterioration, would not have needed to be the “fine” linen as supplied by Joseph of Arimathea specifically to the cross (synoptic gospels). There is, or should be, a self evident reason for Joseph supplying costly fine linen to the cross. It was intended to signal to the Romans and spectators that the victim of that execution was still regarded, albeit in death, as a highly esteemed individual in the eyes of his disciples and other followers. Whilst the subject of a humiliating drawn out ordeal, being made a public spectacle, there was nothing in law to prevent him being honoured just as soon as he had been pronounced dead. That’s especially so in view of the fact that Pilate had been approached and given his personal authorisation for the body to be handed over to Joseph, a noteworthy citizen, as distinct from being cast into a pit or similar. In short: Joseph’s linen was intended to be seen as first and foremost a mark of respect. To say it MIGHT have served subsequently as the final burial shroud as well is not incorrect, merely improbable, and some might think an attempt to extend the time scale for imprinting opportunities into the tomb, and indeed right through (in some minds) to the instant of resurrection, so as to suggest the body image was a byproduct of resurrection. The short distance between cross and tomb is not a problem in the medieval narrative, at least my version thereof, which sees the TS as an attempt on the part of forgers to create a Mk2 version (post mortem) of the Veil of Veronica. The Mk1 version, according to legend, was the result of brief contact between the face of Jesus, captured en route to the cross, by a sympathetic bystander with a head shawl. If that incident of legend was sufficient to capture the image of the face, then why not the considerably longer time required to transport the body from cross to tomb, even if nearby?.","date":"2015-11-29","mins":"2:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/29/new-very-short-video-from-national-geographic/","cat":"video","title":"New, Very Short Video from National Geographic"},{"id":"comment-215314","author":"colin_berry","post":"It’s frankly pointless arguing the case on this site for a medieval provenance, based on what forgers thought could be foisted as a Veronica inspired narrative (imprinting en route from cross to tomb) if the responses are centred, as they invariably are, on what is surmised to have happened, or might have happened, in the 1st century.

From my reading so far the general principles are reasonably well understood. Calcium plays an important role in the pith of flax stems, forming bridges between the pectin molecules, stabilising the structure. Retting, i.e. Microbial or chemical breakdown, is greatly assisted in model systems by including a chelating agent (EDTA, oxalic acid etc) that ties up the calcium and makes it easier to digest the pectin, thereby separating the flax fibres. One finds at the end that there’s just a small proportion of the initial calcium present, typically 25ppm, a sixth of the original (data and source available on request). So calcium goes down on retting, not up, but what’s left at the end may well account for the Ca that’s presently being attributed to added chalk or gypsum – with no good evidence that I can see..","date":"2015-01-14","mins":"10:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"id":"comment-183429","author":"colin_berry","post":"Would you not agree Kelly that the chief difficulty as regards identifying the presence of ancient blood and distinguishing it from imitations (maybe more sophisticated than vermilion) is the organic nature of the constituents you list (proteins, carbohydrates) or their chemical instability (bilirubin). That’s why one needs to have an alternative marker or signature for blood that one can be certain does not degrade with time, or volatilize. I did suggest one many moons ago, but fear I was misunderstood by you Kelly. I refer to mineral salts. You seemed to think I saw them as somehow trumping the ABO markers etc, that I was somehow failing to see they were non specific to blood and therefore irrelevant. I’m not sure I ever managed to make you see the limited but crucial role I saw for mineral salts in answering the question: is it blood or a blood substitute? Let’s try again. Whole blood has a characteristic spectrum of metallic and non metallic mineral ions. The chief cations of interest in the present context are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and maybe some of the trace elements like zinc and copper. I’d include iron except it’s problematical for a variety of reasons. Then there’s the anions (chloride, sulphate etc). If it’s whole blood on the TS, one expects a particular mix of cations and anions compared with blood free areas which will be relatively potassium and magnesium rich. If the “blood” on the TS were a “serum exudate of retracted blood clots” then there would be proportionally (not absolutely, but proportionally note) less potassium and more sodium, less magnesium and more calcium. Nope, I’m not claiming those ions are specific markers for blood, which clearly they are not. I’m simply saying that when blood or blood serum is deposited on linen, then the characteristic mix of cations and anions should still be there centuries later, regardless of what has happened to the organic constituents by way of chemical and/or microbiological decomposition. I’ll say nothing for now about the ‘potassium’ controversy, and whether or not there’s sufficient potassium in TS blood stains to support a claim for whole blood as distinct from a serum fraction. What I do say is that any medieval forger minded to use vermilion as a substitute for real blood (whether of human or animal origin, whether whole or otherwise) would not have bothered or even been aware of its mineral composition. Surely a careful appraisal of mineral distribution, especially between blood v non blood areas, can assist in deciding whether we are looking at blood versus a crude pigment substitute from an artist’s palette.It may even help distinguish between whole blood or a serum exudate where the organic constituents are extensively age degraded. If consistent with whole blood (or even if not) then questions as to the origin or ABO type of the blood then need more sophisticated analysis where mineral ions serve no further use. Was I misunderstood? Does this comment help to clear up any misunderstanding that may have existed? Afterthought: there’s a technical issue that I’ve omitted to mention, namely the (in)sensitivity of X ray fluorescence detection, it being suited to higher atomic number elements like potassium than to sodium. Any return by a STURP Mk2 to Turin should in my view include old fashioned emission (‘flame’) or atomic absorption spectrophotometry even if destructive, or we risk having another 30 years of fruitless debate as to what the results mean. Many moons ago I proposed a comp0romise: harvesting soluble metal ions and other minerals by pressing a damp strip of de mineralized fabric across the TS at one or more levels, causing minimal and probably unnoticeable damage, then dividing the strip into cm squares to get a mineral profile.","date":"2015-01-15","mins":"3:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"id":"comment-183031","author":"colin_berry","post":"Give it a rest, Charles.

Three independent labs, in Arizona, Zurich and Oxford, were each given four samples, making 12 datings in all. The dates varied within expected margins of error, but all put the linen as younger than 600 AD. The shroud may or may not bear the genuine imprint of a body, but that body is not the body of Jesus or of anyone who lived before 600 AD.” What possible justification can there be for implying that Dawkins has – or had – doubts as to the dating result when, right or wrong, he expressed total confidence in its ballpark accuracy,. He conceded NOTHING WHATSOEVER to those who would have us believe it was a bum result. Methinks that reference to Dawkins should be excised forthwith from Dan’s margin comments.

You see, even if it was remiss of Dawkins to have made no mention of the invisible re weave scenario, that does not mean that he was unaware of it. Maybe like me, he did a quick mental calculation, and asked himself what the likelihood was that a sample would comprise just the right proportions of 1st and 16th century threads to produce a answer of 1325 +/ 65, that midrange value being just 30 years short of the first recorded appearance of the TS in W.Europe.

It would take some lab experiments to see if this kind of weak release of heat could really start a latent image that would end up developing like the Shroud image (with all its known properties). But one thing’s for sure : the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers we see in the image area on the Shroud cannot be acheive with a scorch or any kind of high energetic radiation. It’s not me who say this but true radiation experts.Max Patrick Hamon : Re your “Knight Templar Scorch theory’ and Templar archaeology (edited) As a professional cryptologist, I got published a paper on deciphering Templar enigmatic graffiti, see 4th National Symposium held in Loches on Ancient Graffiti (2006), proceedings published in 2010 (ed. Association Sauvegarde Patrimoine Archéologique et Glyptographique + General Council – Indre et Loire). Please state exactly what is meant by “discontinuous distribution of coloured fibres” and what your mean by “scorch”, and why you think one is incompatible with the other. Rogers used the term “discontinuous” simply to mean that coloured and uncoloured fibres could be adjacent to each other, and STURP described the character of the Shroud image as a scorch in all but name (dehydrated, oxidised carbohydrate). But who’s to say that there were not masses of adjacent coloured fibres originally, and that the more intensely coloured ones have not fractured and fallen off. Leaving just faintly and evenly coloured fibres here and there that have given birth to this new term “stochastic” (Rogers and others have commented on the brittleness of coloured image fibres – such as remain).

What’s needed now is to get the reverse image (like we have with the Shroud) and look at the 3 D imaging properties. The crucifix, while better than a flatter model, only has one area of mild double levelling (the loincloth). This is where I have to agree with Matthias that with the Shroud, if it is a scorch fake, we see a level of precision that is hard to imagine a medieval artistan being able to execute given the complexity of the figure (three levels on the front, bent knees at the dorsal). If it is a fake, the artist went with one of the most difficult models around. Experiments like yours increase the possibility of it being a scorch, yet at the same time decrease the probability, imo. Still, well done sir! Thanks for the appreciative comment, David. I would persevere without it, that being the nature of the inquisitive beast that lurks within, but it’s always nice to have some positive feedback from time time, no matter how qualified with ifs and buts. I have just this minute finished imprinting the dorsal side of my brass crucifix, and made a posting of the new results (the existing ones getting a bit too long).

The evidence of the bloodstains, you say? Yes, those bloodstains those very prominent stains that do indeed look, or are meant to look, like bloodstains, but which we are supposed to regards as ‘serum exudates of bloodclots’ in order to get round some difficulties re the time lapse between crucifixion and placing in a burial shroud.

Rather than provide links, why not do some experimenting yourself. Lay your hands on a shallow bas relief, like a horse brass, preferably one with lots of detail, heat it on a cooker hob, then press onto linen or cotton not just once, but several times as it cools, and note the image intensity tapering off to zero. Then take some digital photographs, enter into Image J, and look first at the light/dark reversed image (using Edit Invert). That alone can have some of the character of the Secondo Pia negative. Then use the 3 D enhancement tool, and you may well be into wow factor territory. You see, the mere act of light/dark reversal can totally transform the look of a negative image, such as a contact scorch, through promotion of white space, and demotion of harsh dark space. One can demonstrate this by doing a quick charcoal sketch of the Shroud image as is (“light/dark reversed”) and putting that into Image J. Result – a luminous, ghostly image that has an almost photographic quality, except for the lack of directionality through having no lateral, asymmetric shadows. There are still shadows, though, like eye sockets etc, but they are symmetrical – the left eye socket having the same shade intensity as the right. It’s not rocket science, believe me.

The particles bump into nearby particles and make them vibrate more. This passes the thermal energy through the substance by conduction, from the hot end to the cold end. Convection The particles in liquids and gases can move from place to place. Convection happens when particles with a lot of thermal energy in a liquid or gas move, and take the place of particles with less thermal energy. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. Radiation All objects transfer thermal energy by infrared radiation. The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation it gives off. No particles are involved in radiation, unlike conduction and convection. This means that thermal energy transfer by radiation can even work in space, but conduction and convection cannot. *************************** Thank you Auntie BBC. You can go now.

See Lea and Hannan (1949) in Biochem.Biphys Acta for early studies with model systems. It is outside the scope of this enquiry unless the amine and reducing sugars are specified, and, more importantly, have left identifying traces on linen (e.g, a surplus of nitrogen in image bearing areas, or unreacted reducing sugars in non image areas). Raymond Rogers omitted to do these simple tests, making no attempt to test for nitrogen, and making vague and unsupported claims for the presence of traces of “starch” (which is in any case not a reducing sugar, and would have to be extensively degraded to fit that description). This contribution is about known physics, not speculative chemistry. In any case, even if there were chemical evidence for Maillard products on linen, it would still be highly problematical as to how homogeneous imaging could have taken place, as others have pointed out previously. In short, the evidence of the naturalistic model based on Maillard browning reactions is tenuous to say the least.

Here’s just 3 for starters, all “conjoint”. 1. Garlaschelli technique : baking in oven for 3 hours at 215 to 220 degrees C of linen that carries a temporary frottage (rubbing) imprint using ochre pigment from real human being (plaster of Paris template for head). Garlaschelli, 2010 (Life size reproduction of the Shroud of Turin and its Image, Journal of Imaging Science and Technology, 54(4)040310 040314. One sees differential browning – area under ochre pigment and background both acquire aged look (browning) but the pigmented area more so than background. The pigment can be washed out – or drop away naturally – to leave a faint scorched in image, or as LG described it, etched (possibly assisted by acidic impurities in the ochre that aid dehydration reactions) Likely mechanism: dual (convection/conduction, possibly accompanied to a minor extent by radiation/convection). 2. My own ‘thermostencilling’ technique, in which a dry charcoal sketch or slurry painting is irradiated with heat (and light) from an incandescent light bulb, to produce a scorch under the charcoal. Http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2012/01/how to make your very own turin shroud.html Again, the charcoal can (though occasionally with some difficulty) be washed out to leave the scorched in image. Likely mechanism: radiation/conduction (Only later did I realize that my thermostencilling was similar in principle to G Ls, the difference being the form of thermal energy used to heat up the sensitizing solid. 3. Direct contact scorch e.g. From pressing a heated metal or ceramic template against the linen. Likely mechanism: conduction (primarily), possibly (probably?) with secondary convection (superheated steam and other pyrolysis gases produced by dehydration of linen carbohydrates in direct contact with hot metal, producing some linen degradation at points not in immediate contact, especially deeper into the interstices of the weave). Having listed just three, non single mode, i.e. More complex conjoint mechanisms, the next step is to go back to the summary of the Fazio/Mandaglio paper,(s) and see what is true but not new, and what is new but not true. At this stage there need be no consideration of the nature of the scorch at the microscopic level, which is probably more a matter of impression unless or until accompanied by high magnification pictures..","date":"2013-11-13","mins":"2:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"id":"comment-50685","author":"colin_berry","post":"Yes, I know his place of work, but that has not helped in tracking down his published work, Putting fazio g stochastic into Google scholar only turned up his Shroud paper with 5 citations.

I still have a few more observations to make regarding the fundamental physics, but the main point has been made, namely that while there are only 3 textbook mechanisms for heat transfer, there are in fact 7 when you put them together in their various combinations. That gives one a greater range of options for creating subltety if setting out to reproduce the Shroud image, even if we have still not achieved that to everyone’s satisfaction (probably an unrealistic objective anyway, given that some view the modelling as having to meet aesthetic as well as scientific criteria). One needs also to be mindful of the effect of ageing on the Shroud image. As Luigi Garlaschelli has pointed out, we are not seeing the image as it would have appeared at its moment of birth so to speak. To give just one example: we know that image bearing fibres are mechanically weaker than non image fibres, probably more brittle and prone to fracture. So when we see a scattering of pale yellow fibres we must not be too quick to suppose this implies some profoundly mysterious process of image imprinting. It may merely mean that more densely scorched images have broken off in the course of time, and we are simply seeing the ones that have survived through being only minimally scorched. Do you suppose that Fazio and others, when speaking of discontinuities, are merely using a different term for the so called half tone effect, which arises from having all image fibres uniformly pigmented, with image density being due to numbers of image bearing fibres per unit area only? Or is there some other meaning with maybe transverse banding as well, such that a single fibre could be uncoloured for some of its length, and then abruptly become coloured? But if that were the case, would that not be totally consistent with contact scorching?.","date":"2013-11-13","mins":"6:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"id":"comment-51211","author":"colin_berry","post":"David Goulet : If anyone is doing another heated statue experiment, I’d be interested in seeing the result when using a statue with a minimum of three levels of contact – approximating the three levels of the body in the Shroud (top hand, bottom hand, lower trunk).

I discovered and reported recently that images made by by new imprinting process with white flour OR even with simple direct scorching can be totally bleached with sodium hypochlorite (ordinary domestic bleach). Https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc07967 bleach hand roasted flour imprint.jpg?w=300&h=225 See treated white patch on right, control linen on left. Now that may be because my images are not models for the “Shroud” image. That may indeed be the case, since STURP said that ordinary bleaching chemicals did not affect the TS image, that it required diimide, not an everday reagent. But it’s not impossible that the bleach in my home is different from that tested by STURP, in which case there’s a chemical probe ready and waiting to be tested., Some pilot work is needed, but it seems likely that the bleaching works by chlorination across double bonds (diimide is said to work in a similar way by hydrogenation). Chlorination tends to increase lipid solubility, making the products easy to extract into organic solvent. They can then be analysed chromatographically and/or by mass spec.The beauty of chlorination is that there are two types of chlorine in nature – Cl 35 and Cl 37 in an approx 3:1 ratio which makes it easy to detect which fragments on mass spec are the chlorinated derivatives. Where there’s a will, correction, research grant, there’s a way.

Was that really the top magnification available to folk like Fanti et al (2010), the list including Thibault Heimburger, because if it was, then my ageing eye sight is simply not capable of seeing the detail that is claimed to be there. Is there a fancy Latinized term not just for seeing things that are not there, or not seeing things that are there, but as of this moment in time, not seeing things that are not there? Who’s to say these features, if present, are not a characteristic of retted flax fibre that are shown up in the imaging process, but in reality are also in latent form in non image fibres? Might those discontinuities and striations be visible in the edges of the 1532 scorched fibres too? Has anyone looked? Were they photographed at high magnification too?
