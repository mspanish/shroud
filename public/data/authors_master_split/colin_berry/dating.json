The names of everyone involved in the decision making re the radiocarbon dating should have been on the 1989 Nature paper. But important names are missing, meaning that key individuals were unaccountable for their actions and decisions. Knowing what we know now, if the full list of names had been on that paper, then a case could have been made for having the paper withdrawn through failure to get straight answers to straight questions and not, repeat not because of any serious methodological failings on the part of the three radiocarbon laboratories, but because of the murky circumstances surrounding the sampling decisions and procedures and subsequent deployment of undocumented material, the provenance and history of which we are expected to take on trust.

You see no issues at all with the C 14 testing, no issues with the protocols? No possibility of bias? That’s rather unscientific reasoning in my opinion. I’m not an academic or scientist but I have ‘lived among them’. And I’ve learned two things about them: firstly they are indeed human beings who put their socks on one foot at a time like the rest of us. Secondly the academics reputation, his stature among his peers, his mojo, is directly tied to being able to defend his theories. To be proven to be in the wrong is no trifling matter. It can scuttle one’s professional esteem. This sword is two edged of course and we see this pressure on both sides of the Shroud debate. I can see in many sindonologists the need to be right, to fanatically defend a theory even when others raise reasonable doubts. I have no reason to think it would be any different for the C 14 scientists. Do scientists take some secret oath when they get their degrees that states they will only serve the truth and forsake any personal ego in their careers? I know doctors take oaths and they still botch it up. And even if further C 14 testing was permitted, are we so certain that even with more rigorous protocols that the results would be any more accurate? This cloth is unlike any other we’ve seen. Did the image formation process itself (whether it occurred by some bio process 2000 years ago, or by a yet unknown medieval process) affect the cloth and its carbon reading? Are there other infusion elements (aside from threading) that may skew the results? Even if new C 14 data pointed to a 40 AD year date I wouldn’t be using that as my smoking gun. C 14 is only one cog in the wheel. “Did the image formation process itself (whether it occurred by some bio process 2000 years ago, or by a yet unknown medieval process) affect the cloth and its carbon reading?” No, not unless there was a totally unexpected phenomenon beyond the realms of known science, aka a miracle (like C 14 atoms changing their half life through faster or slower radioactive decay). But the radiocarbon dating was not intended to prove or disprove a miracle. It was intended simply to date by a known method with its strengths and indeed limitations. Whatever your misgivings about the objectivity of science, there is a simple remedy if you doubt the results of any given scientist – or group of scientists – namely to demand that the findings be confirmed by others, or that modifications be made to the experimental procedures to take account of legitimate objections. So why are you not pressing for a re dating? Is it because you think it improbable they will come up with what, for you, would be the right answer? If so, one has to ask whose objectivity and bias is most in question – your own or that of those dodgy untrustworthy scientists posturing as if totally infallible – which in my experience wins neither friends nor admirers at scientific congresses, a modest, measured, patient, systematic, occasionally self critical MO being much better received and indeed expected..","date":"2013-10-18","mins":"10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-47902","author":"colin_berry","post":"It’s easy to see how an ancient carbon based material could be dated as much younger – contamination by more modern undecayed carbon 14 being all that would be needed. .

One’s immediate concern would be with how one’s answers look alongside those of the two other labs. Will the results be reasonably concordant, and help to establish the credibility of some very sophisticated technology, one that sorts atoms by mass, or will the results differ so much as to bring the technique into disrepute, vis a vis the alternative but less sensitive method based on counting radioactive disintegrations? In the event the answers from the three labs were reasonably concordant, i.e. 1260 1390, so it’s hard to see where the “poverty of scientific thought” comes into it, except to further beliitle the contributions from the three participating labs. One can only assume that the commentator has no experience of the collaborative inter laboratory trials that are routine in analytical protocol development. I have experience of several, notably in dietary fibre and resistant starch analysis, where each lab receives samples from a single batch of test material which are then separately analyzed, each lab following its own protocol, and results then displayed and published, warts an’ all. On those results can depend which particular variant is adopted later as the international standard for analysis. So there is absolutely no reason for any of those three labs thinking that they were engaged in a futile exercise, merely because they were all working on the same corner specimen. As I say, it could be regarded as a ‘ranging shot’ exercise, and most folk should appreciate why one of those is needed even in a military context, thus giving rise to the expression. The idea that perfect targeting for a perfect outcome can be achieved in one fell swoop is simply not of this world. But I have a stronger criticism to make of the comment. Why is there no call for a repeat determination, now that we have confirmation that the AMS procedure can give reasonably concordant answers in the hands of different laboratories, using different variants? Suppose the same medieval range of dates were obtained from 5 or 6 different sites chosen at random, making it impossible to sustain the argument that all had been invisibly mended. Would some new grounds be sought for protesting against a “poverty of scientific thought”?

(emphasize mine) When, how, who received these samples, the “chain of evidence” etc… The answer could not be found in a single document. I had to read many published and unpublished documents (in Italian and English) coming from Gonella, Riggi, Rogers, Adler…comparing them and trying to understand.

In football terms it almost feels like piling on at this point. The ’88 dating is essentially useless, does it make much difference to know to what degree it was useless? It’s a mistake in my opinion to write off the 1988 testing on grounds of sampling deficiencies. Best to regard what we have as a ranging shot, one that gives a high degree of confidence in the analytical procedures per se, given the reasonable degree of concordance achieved between the 3 laboratories, and the different clean up methods employed. When different laboratories are approached to collaborate on a particular project, I suspect that a particular kind of modus operandikicks in – the routine inter laboratory multicentre collaborative study that generally leads to particular variants of analytical protocol being pitched against each other, and one or other being selected finally as having the edge over others chosen as “official” method, i.e. Winner. What generally happens is that each lab is given the same sample to analyse (or range of samples) that have been highly homogenized to reduce sample to sample variation. Each lab then tries to obtain an answer that is deemed most accurate and most precise. So it’s possible (what follows is pure conjecture) that the three labs did not see their initial role as one of dating the Shroud, but of producing an accurate and precise answer for whatever fragment – or fragments – of the Shroud that were given to them. That does not seem unreasonable as a first step – with a conservative single sampling site having finally after much wrangling been decided upon (on whose final authority I am still not clear about). After all, anyone with a grain of common sense would know that an artefact like the Shroud cannot be randomly sampled at multiple sites if it leaves it disfigured. Even if more than one sampling site had been permitted, it might seem overkill to have 3 or more labs of (then) uncertain pedigree all tackling the task, needing three times the material that a single lab would have needed. So why not compare the three labs’ performance first on a single inconspicuous sampling site, then select the lab whose data inspires the greatest confidence to tackle the big question – the age of the Shroud from multiple sampling sites? On paper, one would have expected one of the labs to have been invited back for that Phase 2 analysis (or even draw lots if all were deemed equal to the task). Why did it not happen? Shell shock maybe?

It consistently returns an answer that is 1300 years younger. No one knows why it doesn’t work on ancient linen. The systematic error seems greatest when the linen constitutes a holy relic, especially one owned by the Vatican, but since Vatican holy relics can only be tested once, at least when the first result is wrong, we’ll probably never get to understand why holy relics give the wrong answer when carbon dated. ; ).","date":"2013-05-08","mins":"5:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/07/an-email-from-professor-christopher-ramsey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An email from Professor Christopher Ramsey"},{"id":"comment-33602","author":"colin_berry","post":"AMS less accurate than radioactivity? Whatever gave you that idea? “Radiocarbon dating using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) differs from the decay counting methods in that the amount of 14 C in the sample is measured directly, rather than by waiting for the individual radioactive decay events to occur. This makes the technique 1,000 to 10,000 times more sensitive than decay counting. The enhanced sensitivity is achieved by accelerating sample atoms as ions to high energies using a particle accelerator and using nuclear particle detection techniques. Additionally because of the increased sensitivity, counting times are greatly reduced (minutes to hours, instead of days) and sub milligram sample sizes can be routinely measured. Because of this, a greatly increased range of sample types and sizes can now be measured that previously gas proportional or LSC counting techniques could not.” http://www.radiocarbon.com/PDF/Beta AMS Methodology.pdf How can you possibly make claims for the superior accuracy of radioactivity if the amounts needed are too large to be practical? Are you perhaps importing data from totally unrelated situations where sample size is not a problem? If so, who’s to say that AMS would not be as accurate, if not more so, using those same larger samples (while not requiring them, and in fact having no use for them anyway, given the inherently greater sensitivity achieved through counting isotopes by their mass than by their radioactive decay)?.","date":"2013-05-13","mins":"11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/07/an-email-from-professor-christopher-ramsey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An email from Professor Christopher Ramsey"},{"id":"comment-33340","author":"colin_berry","post":"Ron : I don”t need to be schooled, but maybe you do.

At the time of the Shroud testing AMS was very new and none of the labs had much experience with the method, whereas the other method was fully understood and used for many years. Also prior to the 1988 c14 AMS only dating of the Shroud, a series of tests were performed to compare the different methods and reliability, the results; the AMS system proved less reliable and with a miriad of phantom dates, and as mentioned before ‘unexplained’ errors. Errors and dicrepancies never resolved before the Shroud testing. How do you explain this, if the AMS system is sooo much more accurate? The whole testing was a mess, from the selection of just one unreliable method, to the choice of just one sample from one area of the Shroud. Worse though was the labs accepting to the samples which would not be representaive of the whole, then cutting the samples to pieces much smaller then protocol suggested, then taking the contamination issue with no seriousness, and fianlly fudgung with the numbers to make all labs dates seem in comparison…It was a sham and a shame. R I’m reminded of a time honoured principle from nutrition, namely that food that is not eaten is not nutritious. In other words, it doesn’t matter how many nutrients are in the skin of a potato (say). If folk eat most of their potatoes without their skins, then those (potential) nutrients are not nutritious. Applying the same principle, measuring the age of the Shroud by its radioactivity is not accurate if no one can use the procedure on account of its low sensitivity requiring gram quantities of linen. To invoke radioactivity as the gold standard when just one carbon atom in a trillion is C 14 is simply to pull the wool over people’s eyes. It’s got to be AMS of nothing (unless a third method were to be discovered)/ Yes, of course AMS data have to be handled with circumspection, and of course they may not be as accurate as one would wish, but all of that and more is implied in the term ‘state of the art’, the one with which you took issue, seeming to assume it meant superior in all respects. It doesn’t mean that at all – it simply means a refinement of existing technology, or, in this case, a break with it, providing a new approach that may overcome one or more insuperable drawbacks with what preceded it. In this instance, it is sensitivity that is the crucial factor, but when 3 labs each produce a medieval dating for the Shroud there is little scope for attacking the methodology per se, and claiming it to be less “accurate” than another method that is too insensitive for its accuracy to be assessed, at least with the Shroud. As for the reams of knocking copy on the AMS Shroud dating in general, you do realize, don’t you, that the contamination/reweaving hypothesis is a totally separate issue from how the C 14 was measured, since reweaving (had it occurred) would have given an elevated value for C 14 no matter how measured? Personally, I don’t think it did occur, and I consider Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta paper with the ‘donated’ threads of dubious provenance, with alleged end to end splicing, re dying etc etc to be one of the more bizarre offerings I have encountered in the Shroudology literature. It’s hard to imagine any other mainstream journal accepting that paper (which he submitted to what was essentially his own in house journal, having helped establish it, while employed inconspicuously as a thermochemist working for the US Government on safety aspects of chemical explosives, and who served for many years on its editorial board). Nobody goes to the trouble of invisible, highly painstaking mending of an inconspicuous corner of the Shroud when there is major fire damage elsewhere that has been crudely patched.

He could then have added that extra detail of a reversed epsilon on the forehead, even if he hadn’t a clue what it signified, instead of playing tricks with the scourgers’ amazingly telescopic fingers.

I think the only reason you doubt these observation Colin is the fact that they are extremely problematic for your personal idea of what might have produced the Shroud image! There’s nothing in the least bit problematical for me as regards superficial images on linen, having done experiments (unlike you) and reported what I see, with accompanying photographs, like the ability to imprint an intense scorch image on a single layer of plant cells (onion epidermis) with scarcely any effect on underlying linen. What is problematical is the way that you and others bandy around the term “discontinuous distribution of coloured fibres” without bothering to produce high magnification photographs to illustrate exactly what you mean, and failing to eliminate the heterogeneity of the retted flax fibre surface as the possible cause of that heterogeneity. You and others are far too quick to see mystery, giving your agenda driven pro authenticity spiel (plus tirades and personal attacks) a veneer of superficial plausibility by recourse to second hand stochastic mumbo jumbo and quantum weirdness without ever stopping to consider the basics of flax botany or the vagaries of retting biotechnology.

One can imprint off a real person (or statue, bas relief etc). The imprinting medium (flour paste etc) is non injurious to skin. 2. One can mould the linen to contours manually if desired, capturing as much or as little of the 3 D relief as one wishes (with more or less risk of lateral distortion). 3. Development of the image in the fumigation chamber can be monitored visually at intervals over minutes or hours until one has obtained optimum image intensity, and the least damage to linen fibres. 4. Retained acid fumes after development can be neutralized, either with lime water, or by dry dusting with powdered chalk. However, some weakening of fibres must be expected. 5.The end product can be claimed to be an ancient sweat imprint, left on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen when the body was transferred from cross to a makeshift stretcher/body bag. 6. The technique allows for blood (or blood substitute) to be applied at the same time as body imprinting medium, provided the blood or substitute stays red in nitric acid fumes (real blood does not – it quickly turns a brown colour). Blood would have been applied after. I.e. Directly on top of the gooey imprinting medium to account for there being no body image under Shroud “blood”. 7.The use of an extraneous organic material (flour etc) allows for the possibility of the newly imprinted and developed image being conspicuous, but slowly fading over the centuries as the pigmented material flaked off or became otherwise degraded, provided there was a fairly stable “ghost image” left behind, the one we see today. 8. When applied to new linen, the technique has a side effect that would be seen as a bonus – artificial ageing of the linen. Centuries later, pro authenticity chemists and others would be delighted to find there was less potential vanillin and more mechanical weakness than would be expected of medieval linen a mere 700 years old. 9. An imprint developed by oxidation and/or other chemical reactions may (or may not) lack the fluorescence of a thermal scorch image. 10. Chemical action of limited duration may result in more superficial change to linen fibres than is possible by thermal scorching, such that one sees no colouring at the interface of the SCW and central lumen. Reverse side coloration can be minimized by suitable adaption of technique (thick linen, use of sizes to block up pores, use of viscous imprinting media etc). As properly noted, all this is simply an hypothesis at this stage, one that will need a lot of experimental work to evaluate, with the possibility of premature paradigm death at any stage. However, I shall be taking a break from experimental work for at least a fortnight probably longer, these last few weeks having been fairly hectic, spent in and out of the garage, trying to avoid or escape acid spillage and acid fumes, first with the H2 SO4, and now with HNO3 (Phase 1 complete)..","date":"2015-04-22","mins":"3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/20/carbon-date-the-shroud-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Carbon Date the Shroud Again?"},{"id":"comment-197606","author":"colin_berry","post":"Am I the only one to think there’s a deliberate and sustained attempt by two individuals to blitz the site with trivia, the intention being to push earlier comments they don’t like out of “Recent Comments”, and thus ‘off the radar’ screen if attached to older postings?

It will generalize the model, such that it’s simply one based on a two stage procedure: imprinting with a harmless substance that sticks first to skin, and then transfers easily to linen under light pressure to give a ‘latent’ image. The latter is then converted to the image that existed on the TS when first produced (the nature of which we can only guess at). That second stage is probably one of chemical OR thermal development (the latter as per Garlaschelli). First stage Imprinting with second stage development, the two separated in space and time, sums up the new model, having a great deal in common with Garlaschelli’s (a major influence in my thinking these last 3 years) but some important differences re detail. Let’s not get too bogged down in detail.

After sleeping on that list of 10 points, all I would add for now is a gift wrapper in dubious good taste (thinking of the sensibilities that prevail generally on this site, with one or two notable exceptions). There’s a bit of code in scientific research, summed up as “looking where the light is”. Charles Freeman is the historian with his “just a painting” thesis (dogma?) who is simply “looking where the light is”. PDL and his under occupied ENEA pals with their employers’ laser beams are also looking where the light is, or what they imagine may have existed for a one off instant in time, (and thus beyond the remit of science, Joe M). My latest hypothesis explains why the TS is also a one off, but of medieval provenance,and while difficult to fathom, is still definitely within the remit of science, provided one is prepared to think like a medieval, and not confine one’s search to where the light is. My new starting point, a year or so ago, was to regard the TS as an attempt to replicate Joseph of Arimathea’s linen as it might have looked on arrival at the tomb, BEFORE being replaced by the real burial attire, i.e. Nicodemus’s “winding” sheets after washing and spices, oils etc. It was intended to be a bigger and better whole body, front and back negative imprint (NOT painting) that would trump the Veil of Veronica, then the major draw for medieval pilgrims according to Neil Mc Gregor, recently retired Director of the British Museum. The task was to simulate a conjoint sweat and blood imprint, but to do it in a way that could/would stand up to the closest critical and sceptical scrutiny (barring the canny bishops of Troyes, watching the upstart ‘relic’ drawing funds away from their own cathedral upkeep ). No, they did not scorch the body image with a heated template, not if the aim was to simulate an ancient sweat imprint. They consulted an alchemist, possibly one with a sympathetic religious disposition (Paul of Taranto, the Franciscan monk?). He in turn delivered state of the art proto chemical technology, in the form of nitric acid fumes, guaranteed to turn virtually any organic material into a yellow or brown stain on linen. Sure, it weakens the linen itself, but then the fibres on the TS ARE weaker than expected for something that is only 700 years old according to the radiocarbon dating (objections noted). If as I suspect Paul of Taranto, or someone similar, was the brains behind the TS, then we have an explanation for why the TS image is exotic and such a well kept secret (our alchemist/cleric may have thought that in harnessing his (al)chemical know how for the greater glory of God, he was saving souls that would otherwise have endured everlasting torment.

One is supposed to use INERT solvents for that purpose. My suggestion was to use a Folch solvent partition (mainly chloroform and methanol in the lower organic layer, and mainly methanol and water in the upper aqueous layer) but to do it in the presence of a cationic detergent, e.g. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, which is very good at taking organic anions, even quite polar ones, into the organic layer, from which it can then be concentrated by solvent evaporation and then spotted onto TLC plates or injected into a GLC or HPLC column. Since protoporphyrin IX in blood is an organic anion, due the presence of two propionic acid side chains, as are the bile pigments (bilirubin etc) derived from it by ring scission, so I’m fairly confident that model systems based on aged, degraded blood would confirm that tetrapyyroles could be separated from ‘gunge’ with that extraction medium with no risk of chemical modification. (There are uncertainties regarding the iron and the strength of its chelation by the porphyrin, but let’s not get bogged down in too much detail). So much for the technical detail.

Why was reliance placed on Adler and Heller’s spot colour tests or spectral data, neither of which on their own constitutes hard evidence, and are at best merely suggestive. Jacques de Molay?

I’m glad someone round here takes the trouble to familiarize themselves with others’ claims before passing judgement. Here’s a summary that I wrote back in April 2012. Please note the last sentence, Louis. SUMMARY: Hypothesis: the scorch like image on the Shroud of Turin, at least the initial Mark 1 version, was not of the crucified Jesus Christ, nor 1st century AD. It was of much later medieval origin, in agreement with the carbon 14 dating of the linen, and was that of a Knight Templar, probably Geoffroi de Charney, reputed to be the uncle of the similarly named Geoffroi de Charny, first known owner of the Shroud, which he displayed in the small village of Lirey. De Charney with the – “e”was hideously and slowly tortured and executed by slow roasting in 1314 on the orders of King Philip IV of France, along with other Knights Templar, notably Jacques de Molay. The evidence is to be found by closely examining the Lirey badge, a pilgrim’s lead cast souvenir, recovered from the Seine in 1855 close to the site of the Templars’ execution. The badge shows a Shroud like depiction of a man who bears little or no resemblance to Jesus Christ, and who appears on close scrutiny, the knees especially, to have been roasted to death, not crucified, with a grill like structure on the edge of the badge previously (mis?)interpreted as an “open tomb” (see Ian Wilson’s Historical Notebook). The artist who produced the Mark 1 version of the Shroud on which the Lirey badge was closely modelled was probably commissioned by (?)nephew Geoffroi de Charny to find a way of pointedly marking his uncle’s gruesome death and the extinction of his Templar line in a deliberately ambiguous manner, one that could be mistaken by the casual observer for crucifixion, and not bring further retribution to the holder. To do that he chose an unusual but not unknown pyrographic art form – scorching an image onto linen using hot metal or ceramic templates, probably bas relief as a visual metaphor for death by slow incineration..","date":"2014-01-24","mins":"9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"id":"comment-74393","author":"colin_berry","post":"I have to say, I find your comments here increasingly ill informed and of scarcely any relevance to my own interest in the provenance of the the Shroud. For that reason, I will leave you to your own deliberations. However I cannot let that comment of yours go unchallenged, namely that what I have said clashes with the historical “data” (your term) obtained by Wilson. According to Wilson’s recent update on the Machy Mould, there are scarcely any data on the Lirey period, and such as exists is self contradictory. Here are his own words (followed by a link to the 7 page pdf): “As Shroud historians have long recognised, the big problem about the Lirey expositions is that the surviving documentation about them is so fragmentary and so seemingly contradictory. Thus there is no mention of the Shroud in the documents relating to the foundation of the Lirey church in 1353. Then in May 1356 we have local bishop of Troyes Henri de Poitiers on record as warmly approving an unspecified ‘cult’ – often assumed to be showings of the Shroud – that Geoffroi had instituted at Lirey. Only four months later Geoffroi was dead on the battlefield of Poitiers, he and all others in France having been far too preoccupied with battling invading English for any Shroud showings to have been staged during that time. And yet from 1389 we have the famous memorandum of Bishop Pierre d’Arcis, a successor to Henri as Bishop of Troyes, claiming that ‘thirty four years or thereabouts’ earlier (i.e circa 1355) Bishop Henri had taken great exception to some showings of the Shroud that were being held at Geoffroi de Charny’s Lirey church, and on diligently investigating the matter, Henri had apparently found evidence of fraud, duly putting an end to any expositions being held in Lirey for well over three decades.” http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n78part7.pdf So, not content with mangling my claims for the Shroud, you have now treating Ian Wilson’s with the same cavalier disregard, and then attempting to turn it all into a theological rant with your bizarre reference (presumably) to Lord Ripon’s switch from Anglicanism to Catholicism.

For a start, it’s probably not a vanillin test at all. It could be measuring any number of lignin degradation products. According to this abstract, phloroglucinol /H Cl gives only a weak colour with vanillin, and is more likely to be measuring other substances, notably hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes. But what do I know, not being a thermochemist with a background in safety testing of chemical explosives (Mr.R.Rogers). Protoplasma. 2002 Oct;220(1 2):17 28. O 4 Linked coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes in lignifying cell walls are the main targets of the Wiesner (phloroglucinol H Cl) reaction. Pomar F, Merino F, Barceló AR. Abstract(my bolding) The nature and specificity of the Wiesner test (phloroglucinol H Cl reagent) for the aromatic aldehyde fraction contained in lignins is studied. Phloroglucinol reacted in ethanol hydrochloric acid with coniferyl aldehyde, sinapyl aldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde to yield either pink pigments (in the case of hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes) or red brown pigments (in the case of hydroxybenzaldehydes). However, coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, and highly condensed dehydrogenation polymers derived from these cinnamyl alcohols and aldehydes did not react with phloroglucinol in ethanol hydrochloric acid. The differences in the reactivity of phloroglucinol with hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes and their dehydrogenation polymers may be explained by the fact that, in the latter, the unsubstituted (alpha,beta unsaturated) cinnamaldehyde functional group, which is responsible for the dye reaction, is lost due to lateral chain cross linking reactions involving the beta carbon. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thioacidolysis analyses of phloroglucinol positive lignifying plant cell walls belonging to the plant species Zinnia elegans L., Capsicum annuumvar. Annuum, Populus alba L., and Pinus halepensis L. Demonstrated the presence of 4 O linked hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde end groups and 4 O linked 4 hydroxy 3 methoxy benzaldehyde (vanillin) end groups in lignins. However, given the relatively low abundance of 4 O linked vanillin in lignifying cell walls and the low extinction coefficient of its red brown phloroglucinol adduct, it is unlikely that vanillin contributes to a great extent to the phloroglucinol positive stain reaction. These results suggest that the phloroglucinol H Cl pink stain of lignifying xylem cell walls actually reveals the 4 O linked hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde structures contained in lignins. Histochemical studies showed that these aldehyde structures are assembled, as in the case of coniferyl aldehyde, during the early stages of xylem cell wall lignification Oh, and there’s a couple more quotes about Rogers’ novel so called chemical clock, based on non specific colorimetric testing that I came across yesterday.

He is supposed to be testing the shroud to see how old it is, not deciding in advance that it is older and then concluding that vanillin might be a good clock to prove it. This is bad science. The only way this could be taken seriously would be if Rogers had tested a wide variety of cloths, [of known ages], decided that dwindling amounts of vanillin served as a clock, then — and only then — tested the shroud.” Ingram also criticized the (sic) “Staining is a rough guide to the presence of vanillin and cannot detect very small amounts.” Second quote: “Malcolm Campbell, a botanist at the University of Toronto said: “In biological sciences, a scientist would be hard pressed to get their paper published if they ever attempted to quantify vanillin on the basis of this (phloroglucinol/H Cl) staining technique.” (Rogers of course published in his “own” journal, Thermochimica Acta, that obvious portal for all new and exciting breakthroughs in sindonology).

The preciseness of those “wounds”. In that single phrase you have put your finger on two crucial considerations. First: there is too much preciseness for the blood to have been transferred by the mechanisms proposed (serum exudation from clot contraction, reliquefying of “re moistened” blood clots etc). The imprints are simply too good, too uniform, too well delineated, too stylized, for that to be the case. Secondly, while it is routine to see the words “bloodstain” and “wound”used interchangeably, there is a problem. What one sees on the Shroud are bloodstains, NOT wounds.There is no compelling or persuasive evidence that I am aware of for any laceration or other breaking of skin at any of the locations where one sees blood. One would surely expect to see a prominent laceration for the “lance wound”, for example, but one doesn’t – it’s just blood (except for those like Prof. Fanti possessed of the eye of faith). As for the distribution of blood being true to the Biblical account, how come there was no reference to nail wounds in the wrist, as distinct from the palm. Either in the Bible, or in Western art? The “correctness” of the wrist location was never mooted until the 20th century and its photographs, when it became necessary to explain a wrist location. Similarly, with the wisdom of hindsight (provided by Shroudology) we now have folk telling us that it was of course a “cap” of thorns, not the popular image, again transmitted in Western art, of a “crown”.

It would make just as much sense to say that there was “next to nothing” of the original! Yes, for all his posturing, MPH clearly does not have the first clue about carbon dating technology. His dismissal of “79mg” as next to nothing offers spectacular proof of that. Onto more important matters: earlier on this thread we see Dave B attempting to label me as some kind of diehard sceptic where the Shroud is concerned. He does not seem to appreciate that it is he and others who are the diehard sceptics through their refusal to accept the 88 carbon dating – that while they may raise objections based on alleged contamination or restricted sampling sites, the present findings are the only ones we have unless or until there is a repeat determination. What’s more there are those of us who reject the objections, pointing out as I did to Dave B that Jull was unable to confirm Rogers’ claims for reweaving and contamination. However, there is not need to wait for a re run of the carbon dating, which some “Shroudie sceptics” have been scrambling to discount in advance. There is an easier way of putting Shroud authenticity to the test that is independent of levels of contamination, real or imagined. You Hugh concur with my view, based in my case on close examination of areas where there appears to have been partial flaking of bloodstains, that the body image is not on top of the bloodstains, as we have been led to believe – a necessary prerequisite for authenticity – but that blood is on top of image. Elsewhere on this thread, we have Thibault Heimburger agreeing that the evidence for the man in the TS having been crucified rests entirely on those bloodstains – there being nothing in the base image per se to suggest that particular manner of death. So put those two considerations together, and one has a make or break test for authenticity (or lack thereof). If the bloodstains really did arrive first, one has evidence consistent with authenticity, evidence that is necessary, although not in itself sufficient. But if the bloodstains arrived after the body image, then the Shroud cannot be authentic. Based on the radiocarbon dating, this mainstream non sceptic maintains that the Shroud is indeed not authentic, probably being of early 14th century provenance, and confidently predicts that the existing claims for blood first, image second will not stand up to re investigation...","date":"2013-06-22","mins":"2:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/20/colin-berry-a-hunch-just-that-that-rogers-may-have-been-used/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry:  a hunch – just that – that Rogers may have been used"},{"id":"comment-37615","author":"colin_berry","post":"Others before me have proposed that the image is that of the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar, ie. Jacques de Molay. Why no others? Have you seen the price of linen currently? Making it is labour intensive, you know. Imagine what that length of herring bone weave must have cost, even in the 14th century when labour was cheap (though not that cheap in a prosperous medieval France). How did he die? Mentally subtract the bloodstains from the TS, and there’s no indication whatsoever that the man depicted had been crucified. Then look at the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge. Again: no reason for thinking the man depicted there on the herring bone weave had been crucified (yes there are visual cues to Christ’s crucifixion, but one has to wary of the add ons, and the impressions they were trying to create). Look closely at the Lirey badge, and you may see (with the eye of faith) visual cues that suggest roasting at the stake as distinct from crucifixion, e.g, flesh burned to bone (knees), puffed up arms and legs, a non Christ like figure who seems to be in excruciating pain, judging by the tilt of the head etc. Certainly the figure, by no stretch of the imagination, could be described as “Christ like”, yet there are strong grounds for thinking that the Lirey badge depicted the Shroud as it appeared to pilgrims in the mid 14th century, and that it did not have that biblically correct checklist of bloodstains at that particular point in time. It was merely the double front and back image of a naked man with hands crossed to preserve modesty. So it could have been a representation of a Templar knight being burned at the stake, and then (fancifully) being transferred to an up and over linen Shroud to leave a scorched on imprint through transfer of residual heat. As I say – fanciful. The artist was attempting to “make a statement”, to create a visual metaphor. In other words, the Shroud image, expensively produced, was a then extant – at that time terribly cool style statement i.e. A 14th century allusion to the manner in which Christ met his end on the cross – fast forward to the manner in which the hitherto powerful Templars met their end. All it needed was the addition of some strategically placed bloodstains to morph the latter into the former. Genius. Pure genius.

You have generated all this hot air, but overlooked to do what is necessary in science – to formulate a hypothesis, better still a prediction that can be tested experimentally. Here’s my prediction: that repeat testing of the Shroud at different sites will continue to return a medieval date and that comparison of the Shroud and the original 1534 patches and Holland backing will return an age difference of approx 200 years, perhaps +/ 25 or thereabouts AND, as I said earlier this morning, re investigation will show that the image is underneath the bloodstains, not vice versa as required for authenticity.

But it is far from intractable as some would have us believe. For example, one can take a known weight of linen and measure its cellulose content as glucose. E.g by gas liquid chromatography. If that were 95% say, then one can then proceed to focus on the remaining 5%, and account for some of that, e.g. As lignin, or hemicelluoses, or waxes etc etc and all the time whittle down the estimate for unknown impurity content. The smaller that gets, the smaller the error in the C 14 dating from something other than linen, whether known or not. Science would have never progressed if held up by speculation regarding unknowns that are never specified in detail. Hypotheses about unknown contaminants have to be framed in sufficient detail as to allow them to be tested. Another method is to use different chemical pretreatments – acid, alkali, organic solvents etc singly or in combination. If one gets the same result for each, then it is difficult to argue for a mystery contaminant. In fact, that was done by the 3 labs in 1988 – if one looks at the detailed protocols. There is always the possibility of solubilising the cellulose fibres – for which reagents are available – and then re precipitating the cellulose fibres. Dilution effects alone would leave most if not all contaminants in solution. The one contaminant that would bother me is elemental carbon, e.g. Off candle flames, since we know it is chemically resistant to solvents.

Where does one start? It would take forever and a day to respond to every charge made here, most attempting to strip me of any illusions of having trained and functioned as a research scientist (about which more later). Let’s just address one point for now: I had merely expressed surprise at Dan Porter’s belief that the invisible repair had preceded the fire of 1532. No, there was no confusion in my mind re the patching that followed that fire, merely that any pre 1532 substitution of medieval thread was unlikely to have produced a 1260 1390 dating unless the substitution had been near complete – which would have been virtually impossible to conceal, certainly from an expert eye like that of Mechthild Flury Lemberg who dismissed the repair hypothesis (or ‘theory’ as we say in common parlance – and yes I do know the difference between hypothesis and theory in a strictly scientific context – which a blog site is not). The reverend gentleman was (as I vaguely recall) at the top of a list of returns when I googled to confirm my hunch that any invisible mending would have taken place post 1532 – based as I say purely on radioactive decay considerations. I merely sought some support, to show I was not idly speculating. Yes, I should perhaps have read what he said more closely, and spotted that he was confused in his mind between invisible repair of a corner, and the rough and ready patching of the 1532 damage, but it is somewhat tedious to read here for a second time, the previous well over a year ago, that because I linked to him to reinforce a simple point re chronology, I shared all of his misconceptions. Being put down by proxy, or having my scientific credentials casually rubbished, is not new experience for me. So I am relaxed about that, seeing myself now primarily as a blogger, not a working scientist, with ‘sciencebod’ used tongue in cheek elsewhere. However, it should be other scientists who judge me on the science, not an internet based religious thinker – cum – Shroudologist who says next to nothing about his own background, while not hesitating to pass judgement on the professional standards of a long retired scientist. Yes, we are talking about Jan 2012, just 10 days or so after a headline had appeared in the UK press : “Turin Shroud was created by flash of supernatural light”. The issue in my mind at that time, having thought little about the Shroud since 1988, was one of scientific propriety, of not extrapolating one’s findings from the science to the supernatural, based merely on producing some minuscule scorching of linen irradiated with intense laser generated uv beams. As a retired scientist (sorry for mentioning it again) I knew those uv rays had sufficient energy to break covalent chemical bonds, so scorching was hardly surprising. But neither deceased human beings nor rock tombs are noted for generating uv light, least of all coherent laser beams. … That is the crucial scientific issue here – of my choosing – not a brief passing reference to a reverend gentleman..","date":"2013-05-16","mins":"4:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/16/dog-in-this-fight-or-pony-in-this-race/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dog in this fight or pony in this race?"},{"id":"comment-33805","author":"colin_berry","post":"The samples were obtained in a highly irregular fashion – no one outside of a magic circle know that Gonella had stripped out threads from the very centre of the section taken for radiocarbon dating – an appalling liberty.

Instead, he proceeded to create a chemical house of cards – one that has acquired a totally undeserved level of respectability. Rogers was not a crook.

The way to box clever in science is NOT to reject another’s arguments at the outset, with a view to demolishing them in short order. The trick is to imagine the other’s arguments were one’s own idea, and then try to think up clinching arguments that would convince the sceptics. It’s then that the strengths and weaknesses of a case can become quickly apparent. Having said that, I have to confess that I’m not terribly interested in the fact that an explosives thermochemist set out with one belief re the Shroud, and then changed his mind, based on some microscopy at home with threads of dubious provenance.

Personally I consider that Rogers’ findings in that 2005 are incredible, bizarre even, and others failed to confirm them when they examined carefully their leftovers. Anyway, there is a troll on this site, as I’ve said before, and I don’t care either for the tone of the host’s recent postings either, so it’s time now to take a break. See you all anon.

I’m presently preparing a post for tomorrow that will focus on the issue of differences in mechanical strength, especially fracture resistance between image and non image bearing fibres. Whether that has any bearing on age related changes is anyone’s guess, but all I would say for the moment is this: while cellulose is the major component of flax and linen fibres, it is by no means the one that is central to image capturing or age related changes. One needs to look at the structure of the elementary flax fibres at a higher level of organization. Tomorrow’s post will focus on those nodes that are a feature of linen but absent in cotton.. Admittedly I don’t know a lot about them at present, but the little I do says their interesting component is lignin rather than cellulose. Hugh will be interested I’m sure. Beyond that I can’t comment further at present, lacking as I do detailed information on the nodes compared with inter nodal regions. I’m hoping that someone will be able to help.

It’s because they are afraid it will deliver the same medieval result as before, but with improved statistical precision. That’s assuming that a reasonable number and distribution of samples were to be taken next time around, assuming there is a next time. Andy Weiss and some others on Dan Porter’s site are clearly determined there should be no next time, and can be relied upon to provide an endless stream of (pseudo) scientific objections to support their line, one that makes a mockery of genuine detached science, because it is simply intended for one purpose, and one purpose only, i.e. To OBSTRUCT scientific progress. I have already proposed a solution to contamination by thymol or any other modern carbon compounds. Purify the cellulose to 99.9% purity or thereabouts by solubilising and regenerating, e.g. Using the cuprammonium (Shirley’s) reagent as used for rayon thread manufacture. Then it would not matter if there were still a trace of thymol etc since a mere 0.1% contamination by weight due to unknown contaminants would not be sufficient to affect the result by (probably) more than a year or two….","date":"2012-11-18","mins":"8:02 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/draft-document-discovered-in-the-paper-skip-at-my-local-recycling-centre-ten-killer-arguments-for-opposing-any-re-run-of-the-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"killer_arguments","title":"Draft document discovered in the paper-skip at my local recycling centre: “Ten killer arguments for opposing any re-run of the radiocarbon dating.”"},{"id":"comment-1597","author":"colin_berry","post":"I’ll be more than happy to take you up on that offer, Thibault.

But that cannot provide an absolute scale of dating, in the way that radioactive decay can, since progressive breakage of glucose glucose links in cellulose could be influenced by any number of environmental factors, unlike radioactive C 14 decay which follows a mathematical logarithmic decay curve, with a constant half life etc. These considerations apply to the rather similar kind of chemical approach adopted by Raymond Rogers with his vanillin.

Then one does not need to know what the contaminants are, whether thymol or something else, nor their age, PROVIDED one has taken enough samples from enough locations to be able to dismiss any possibility, largely theoretical, of wholesale invisible reweaving.

Yes, the 3 labs wanted to test from the same area, but that was for statistical homogeneity.

Anyone foolish enough to think he needed a scientific scoop to land his next appointment has only to check his publications in Google Scholar to see how ludicrous is that proposition. Or maybe they think he was a stuffed shirt who was concerned purely with massaging his own credentials around 1988. If so, they could do a lot worse than check out this paper of his submitted to the University of Arizona’s radiocarbon journal advising of systematic errors in the BM’s radiocarbon data in the period running up to 1984. Preliminary statement on an error in British Museum radiocarbon dates M S Tite, S G E Bowman, J C Ambers, K J Matthews Abstract A systematic error has been identified in radiocarbon measurements run in the British Museum laboratory between approximately mid 1980 and the end of 1984, when all dating was halted for a number of months. The measurements potentially affected have numbers between about BM 1700 and BM 2315, and correspond roughly to date lists XV to XIX pub lished in Radiocarbon. The error is systematic, giving dates that are too young by varying amounts: some may have been underestimated by 200 300 years, whilst others may be little affected. BM dates issued during this period should be used with caution. Dates obtained since mid 1985 are not subject to this error as evidenced by repeated radiocarbon measurements of dendrochronologically dated wood (see for example BM 2432, date list XX, forthcoming). A comprehensive set of experiments to clarify and quantify the dis crepancy is continuing. When sufficient data are available a full account of the problem will be published. Submitters of a series of samples during the period in question will also be notified individually.

Barrie Schwortz has said he expected to find evidence of brush strokes in the 1st 30 minutes they were there and Ray Rogers said that if you gave him 15 minutes he would have it (the Shroud’s possible authenticity) shot full of holes (hence his reputation as a “gun slinger”). If, in fact, the Shroud was a forgery, one would expect that STURP would have found something major to indicate that but they didn’t. And all of this once again points towards the idea that the C 14 dating, which is often wrong and dispensed with when trying to determine the date of an object, was wrong for some reason in the case of the Shroud. STURP’s chief fault, as I’ve said before, was in asking the wrong question. When you have an unusual negative image, with some of the properties of a modern photograph, why go spending so long looking for iron or other paint pigments? Why was there not greater attention given to the chemical alteration of linen fibres, to the precise depth of penetration, to the mechanical properties of image v non image fibres, to identifying the chemical nature of the diimide reduction products, e.g. By pyrolysis mass spectrometry. Why was there no attempt to isolate and positively identify “bilirubin” or “protoporphyrin IX”. Why did Rogers get hung up on hypothetical starch coatings, when there was a botanical layer called the primary cell wall that matched his guesstimates of image thickness? Shall I tell you why?

Now some of the Egyptian tests are being redone and, as I understand it, the material is also being redated to the late seventeenth century.

But that was not the case: the three labs were given contiguous specimens, i.e. Adjacent thirds. For randomised sampling, the entire strip would have been placed on a grid with letters up one side, numerals up the other, and then samples allocated by drawing letters and numerals at random, e.g. B7, H2, C5. Since the sampling was not random, and since the high chi squared value simply means that there was a trend, the assumption seems to be in the Shroudie literature, here included, that the trend could have extended across the entire fabric and produced a much greater age elsewhere. But one cannot conclude that, for the simple reason that a single specimen was taken from one corner, so no conclusions can be drawn as to the results outside of the sample area. What the trend would seem to imply is that there was indeed a systematic factor at work, but it was probably little or nothing to do with a systematic C 14 gradient, and everything to do with the labs having chosen clean up procedures that differed in detail. Two criticisms could be made of the labs – first that they consented to proceed with just the single strip, and second that there was no randomized sampling within that strip. Acquiescence to the first may been based on a “let’s cut our losses” principle. OK, they may have thought, the design, if one can so dignify being fobbed off, does not permit one to make statements about the age of the entire Shroud, only that of the corner, and the statistical analysis is of use only in detecting non random variation based on methodological differences re clean up etc. The second may be based on the idea that the project was so compromised by the failure to provide multiple random samples that to then adopt randomized sampling within the single test strip would look a trifle ridiculous – serving merely to highlight the failure to treat the entire Shroud as the sampling frame. The next step should be self evident. Repeat the entire radiocarbon dating using a rigorously designed and implemented sampling frame. Use the same clean up procedure for all the samples. Three labs should not be necessary if one has complete faith in just one of them to do the job professionally. I see no evidence that any of the three labs were less than professional in carrying out their tasks. I wish the same could be said for those who made the decision to take that single corner specimen, dividing it between three different, prestigious research centres. That was to make a mockery of the entire effort, and it is scandalous that the blame is now being placed where it does not belong with wild talk of “fraud” and “prison”and TV documentaries that hint at dark conspiracies.

What he fails to appreciate, which I had hoped would be self evident by now to those who have followed the discussions on this site, is that my real target is not those who believe in Resurrection. It is the scientists, or self styled scientists, who use the Shroud as evidence of Resurrection (or even to insist that it merely enveloped a 1st century man). I would like to get those same individuals to enter freely into debate here, instead of depositing their ex cathedra findings on this site as pdf documents or guerrilla raid comments, then retreating back into to the shadows. They know who they are. Here’s something that might drew them out. This so called pseudo sceptic has now established to his own satisfaction how the Shroud image can be produced in principle. It involves no magic, and is down to earth, almost mundane science. It involves combining elements of my own discoveries with thermostencilling and direct thermal imprinting with those of Luigi Garlaschelli, involving powder frottage and oven baking. The end result is a faint sepia negative image residing primarily (though perhaps not exclusively) on the superficial primary cell wall of linen fibres, and thus approximately 200 600nm thick as proposed for the Shroud image, one that is a negative image, through being an analogue imprint from a 3 D subject or object, and not surprisingly is then 3 D enhancible in Image J and similar programs that read image intensity as image height. Oh, and let’s not forget that thanks to the some crucial detail of Garlaschelli technology, not presently explained, it would probably be non fluorescent, which for some at least, for reasons best known to themselves, serves as the ultimate criterion, the make or break test. The Shroud is just one of my many interests in science (see my sciencebuzz site), and I have many interest outside of science too, none of them proselytizing or agenda pushing in any way, so I frankly consider John’s caricature of me laughable, and one that does not help his case (whatever that is) one little bit. But I’m here today, on this thread, on this site, merely to reiterate what I have been saying previously, albeit by a series of small bite size instalments, namely that there is nothing in the least bit miraculous about the Shroud image – and shame on those who attempt to use the language or technology of science (invariably ill chosen) to prove otherwise, and who in one instance at least, then ask us to ponder on the theological or philosophical implications. Science, or rather the scientific method, is not a branch of philosophy (which is not beyond questioning the validity of the scientific method) and certainly not theology. Indeed, the findings of science, using its ‘questionable methodology’ may occasionally help to inform those two entirely forms of enquiry, neither of which operates on the basis of framing and testing hypotheses that are in principle testable and indeed need to be tested if they are to gain any traction. The idea that hypotheses have to pass John Klotz’s tests based on his criteria of support from existing “facts” (a plastic commodity in his hands, see radiocarbon dating) is ridiculous, as is the equating of hypotheses with “prejudgements”. I test my hypotheses experimentally to see if they stand up, so how can they be prejudgements? What about his hypotheses? How many has he tested. If as one suspects the answer is none, then it is his hypotheses that are prejudgements, and it is John Klotz who is the pot calling the kettle black. As flagged up earlier, I intend to post copies of this response to John Klotz’s charge of “pseudo skeptism” to both my sciencebuzz site and my main shroudie site in due course, unless, that is, anyone, John included, takes strong objection to anything I have said, and has reasonable grounds for those objections..","date":"2013-10-25","mins":"6:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/meanwhile-part-2-works-for-me/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Meanwhile, Part 2:  “Works for Me”"},{"id":"comment-28732","author":"colin_berry","post":"Many moons ago, I said pretty much the same myself – that the radiocarbon scientists should have walked away.

The first is to buy in some radio labelled thymol, add it to linen on a sealed container, see how much becomes attached, either physically (by adsorption) or chemically. To check for the latter, one takes the thymol treated linen through the clean up procedure used in one’s chosen radiocarbon AMS dating protocol to see whether or not it detaches. What if thymol does attach, and does not detach on clean up? It’s not the end of the world. One coping strategy is to determine what proportion of one’s linen is accountable as carbohydrate. That can be done by acid hydrolysis and glc mass spectrometry, and measuring all the carbohydrates (glucose, xylose, arabinose etc). One could then calculate the maximum amount of linen that is non carbohydrate, then assume conservatively that it was all modern carbon (including thymol contaminants), and calculate the maximum reduction in radiocarbon age due to possible/maximal contamination. If that were small, say a few decades, one could stop there. Suppose it were not. Suppose the real age could be centuries older based on possible contamination? Again, it’s not the end of the world. There are ways of dissolving and re precipitating cellulose, the main constituent of linen, so one does one’s carbon dating on purified cellulose instead of whole linen. The advantage of that is one can check the purity of the isolated cellulose by its glucose content (100% of its mass should be accountable as glucose, allowing for water), and even if it’s 99.9%, there’s not enough modern carbon there to throw the dating, whether it’s thymol or something else. This should all have been done 20 25 years ago needless to say. If a result is inconclusive one repeats it (and if there are uncertainties re protocol one addresses them, and does not sit wringing one’s hands, or intoning mañana, mañana.

I’m not trying to be self congratulatory or subjective, but these procedures could test every explanation for the Shroud’s radiocarbon dating and answer all the mysteries surrounding the Shroud. If the Shroud linen cloth, blood and other particles on it were examined at the molecular and atomic level, you could also collect enough new information that scientists could analyze this data for many years to come. I will be further updating this proposal, as well. And on the Petition site:(my bolding) A leading hypothesis published in Scientific Research and Essays in 2012 asserts that particle radiation was emitted from the length and width of Jesus’ dead body while he was wrapped in the Shroud, and it was this “event” which caused the unique images on the cloth. Molecular and atomic testing could prove that hypothesis to be true. …… …..If unfakable and independent evidence was obtained to confirm this hypothesis however, it could actually be used to analyze the central premises of various religions throughout history and in our world today. Objective and independent evidence does not exist to prove the central premises of any other religion, agnosticism or atheism.

But why? Thymol and other phenols with their aromatic (weakly acidic) OH group should not show a bonding tendency towards other hydroxylic compounds, certainly not cellulose, the major constituent of linen, in which the OH groups are in any case hydrogen bonding with one another, explaining the enormous chemical resistance of the cellulose fibres. I for one would have had no hesitation in filtering a reaction mixture with phenols through Whatman filter paper. It would be the easiest thing in the world to take some old linen or paper, treat it with thymol, and see whether the dating is affected. My guess is it will not be appreciably, because thymol will only adsorb physically, and will be removed by the clean up procedures, which is what they are designed for.

So Rogers was essentially an ‘authenticist’, at least when he started to publish work based on his STURP acquired samples.

Not so: MRSC (Member Royal Society of Chemistry) Awarded to graduates (or equivalent) with at least 3 years experience, who have acquired key skills through professional activity.

I can see why those who continue to promote the Shroud as an unsolved mystery, and who reject the radiocarbon dating (naturally) will be keen to dismiss any idea that the Shroud is simply a branded on image, created by actual physical contact between linen and a hot object (the latter with a temperature well in excess of the boiling point of water – or blood)..","date":"2012-03-21","mins":"12:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/21/sharon-hill-should-check-out-her-facts/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Sharon Hill should check out her facts"},{"id":"comment-48338","author":"colin_berry","post":"Cotton is now the fashionable marker for modern(ish) C 14 contamination, it would seem, but if I’m not mistaken the attention being focused on one tiny area of interest – the 1988 radiocarbon sample – vastly exceeds that for any other comparable area.

Could there be a rationale for linen having a significant cotton fibre component by design rather than accident? One has only to look at the wiki entry on linen to see that there could be. One reason for linen being a lot more expensive than cotton is the difficulty of working with flax fibres – they tend to break easily, being less elastic we are told than cotton. Might it be possible to admix enough cotton fibre with flax to get something that behaves better on the loom, but which still looks and feels like linen (cool on the skin in hot weather etc).

So far, the heat scorch hypothesis has yielded explanations for most of of the macroscopic properties, uv fluorescence excepted (ageing effect?) and is making headway on the microscopic one too. The chief problem has been in separating fact from fancy. One is expected to take so much on trust e.g that the TS image is confined to a < 200nm coating, based on some poorly documented experiments with sticky tape, tweezers and a light microscope. One feels that there has to be some unexplored middle ground between that and your high tech surface probes – probing for what exactly? Personally, I think the Shroud image affects the entire diameter of the fibre, as I said today on my current posting, addressing the neglected question as to why image fibres are mechanically weaker than non image ones. That’s probably because the susceptible heat sensitive hemicelluloses are distributed throughout the entire inner core (SCW) as well as the ultra thin outer PCW, but they tend to be overlooked on account of the preponderance of heat resistant crystalline cellulose in the inner core. Ray Rogers, rest in peace, saw only the cellulose. He appeared to have a blind spot for easily scorched hemicelluloses. Thus the \"starch impurity coatings\", putrefaction amines, \"Maillard reactions \" etc etc. There was a 'cobbled together' look about his dismissal of scorching by plain old heat.

The latter is rather rare, and often due to polycyclic aromatic compounds with a planar rigid structure, though that’s not necessarily the case for pyrolysis products of linen. So there’s a sense in which one is making oneself a hostage to fortune if using a uv lamp to decide whether one system accurately models another, especially when one was produced a minute ago, and the other many centuries earlier, the latter having endured all kinds of chemical insults – from fires to thymol vapour. (Let’s not forget the phenomenon of fluorescence quenching). So please don’t be offended when I say that I for one cannot get terribly worked up over the non fluorescence of the TS image. What I would like to do in an ideal world, given the facilities, would be to isolate and identify the chemical species responsible for the fluorescence of a model scorch, and then decide whether the “problem” of the Shroud’s non fluorescent body image (or loss of an initial fluorescence?) is more apparent than real. Incidentally, I wasted the best part of an entire year in Philadelphia, chasing up a yellow green fluorescent species allegedly specific to phototherapy bile, or so I was told on arrival, which in 1970 was billed as the holy grail of bilirubinology. It turned out to be plain old riboflavin, i.e. Vitamin B2, of which there was just as much in control bile too. And I only discovered that by accident, through noticing yellow green fluorescent gels in the lab next door, due to its routine use of riboflavin to photo catalyse the polymerisation of its gels for protein separation.

There were relatively few scorched fibres, even for quite intense scorch imprints. For faint imprints, the scorched fibres were there, but somewhat difficult to find. So how can you maintain that scorching is an all or nothing effect at thread level, colouring all its fibres (typically 50 200)? It’s simply not the case. Scorching by brief contact with a template is or can be a highly superficial process, and I think I now know why (pyrolysis being endothermic, withdrawing substantial amounts of heat from the template, protecting underlying fibres).

The prefacing comment* from Hugh Duncan was not technology, nor was it merely non scientific. It was in my candid opinion anti scientific, and I have to say I’m surprised and disappointed you let it through. * ” It has already been shown that the image is not a burn, plus I don’t think 14th century France had access to electrical soldering irons. However the image looks similar to a burn and I just want to make a replica that appears to be like the original.

Is he aware of any rival scientifically viable explanation that can account for those two properties, excluding miraculous flashes of collimated air attenuated radiation of  undefined wavelength, as yet unmodelled, with little prospect of that ever happening?

(It’s the reason why a mouse needs to eat several times its body weight each day, while an elephant doesn’t). That could have some practical consequences that might require making modifications to one’s imprinting technology, but that shows up the crucial difference between science and technology. Science is governed by immutable laws, whereas technology can generally be altered to fine tune a desired outcome. Those who attempt to assume or impose a radiation model are ignoring one of those cussed and immutable law of science – namely the First Law of Photochemistry. It states that radiation has first to be absorbed before there can be a chemical reaction. How can that be with a white shroud? What kind of radiation is absorbed by white linen that would not be immediately re radiated, ie. With nett absorption close to zero? Until those radiationists can get over that hurdle (and they don’t seem to be making much of an effort) then I say they have a nerve claiming that scorching by contact is impossible in practical terms. It’s not, and I’ve demonstrated that, and am now beginning to understand why it can be restricted to discrete fibres, and highly superficial ones to boot.

No one had microscopes back then, who would have been able to tell if it was a man made scorch?” You have put your finger on one of the chief misconceptions re scorching, one that has been aided, indeed promulgated, I regret to say by Paolo Di Lazzaro, Thibault Heimburger and others with their experimental protocols that “prove” scorching to be hopelessly non superficial. Yes, it’s an uncontrolalble, runaway, all or nothing process we are told, one that quickly produces reverse side scorching (PDL) or in which colours every single fibre in a thread (TH). To which I say NUTS. What we see there are travesties of the truth, as I’ve said repeatedly, but I shan’t waste a second more of my time with those fantasies, based as they are on deeply flawed experimental techniques. Once again I invite folk here to check those claims for themselves by doing my quick and simple experiment at home. Even intense scorches from brief contact with a hot metal template affect a few surface fibres only.

Science is not just about making new discoveries. It’s about others being able to reproduce those findings. If others are unable to do that, then it’s time methinks for some essential spring cleaning on this site. That’s how science progresses – by trial and error. Errors have to be flagged up. One cannot remain silent when one knows that unverified counterclaims are creeping into the public domain, being picked up and linked to elsewhere (e.g.wiki) especially when it’s via the backdoor of non refereed pdfs that provide no facility for leaving a comment, or if they do (PDL posting, Dec 2011, not 2012 as my previous comment) failing to acknowledge or respond to comments). It is totally against the spirit of science to snipe from cover. If one is minded to attack my thinking, PDL and TH, then fine, bring it on, but don’t then run away as soon as I put YOUR so called findings under the microscope, revealing the major indeed mind boggling errors of experimental design or of observation and interpretation.

No one had microscopes back then, who would have been able to tell if it was a man made scorch?” Imagine if you will that someone has set out to create a whole body version of the Veil of Veronica, i.e. A simulated sweat imprint, and has decided that a faint heat scorch from a 3 D template (“statue”) might serve the purpose, especially as scorch and sweat imprints both record prominences only, or what today we would call negative character. How would he set out about the task so as to ensure success on first attempt (linen being expensive). The first thing to realize is that thermometers, microscopes etc are not needed. The aim is simply to produce an image, with no need to submit a write up to shroudstory.manuscript. In other words. The exercise is entirely empirical, requiring no theoretical knowledge whatsoever. Modus operandi? Have several small squares of linen available for testing the ability of the template to produce a faint scorch. One heats the template, testing with strips, and removing from heat when scorches are a little more intense than one wishes. One then removes from the heat, and continues testing until after cooling one can be certain of obtaining a scorch of the desired intensity for a given application time, which might be seconds, or even minutes, depending on the technology one has chosen. If pressing hot template down forcibly into linen spread over damp sand, or sacking say, then the chosen application time might be short, say a couple of seconds, due to high impaction pressure. If linen is spread on top of the template, and damp sacking placed on top, with light manual moulding of fabric to 3 D relief, ti.e low impaction pressure, hen the application time might be longer, say two minutes or more, given the ability of the damp overlay to act as a heat sink AND to allow temperature sensing through one’s fingertips. (I have previously suggested that both LUWU and LOTTO configurations were used to imprint dorsal and frontal sides in the same session, where LUWU is short for Linen Underneath With Underlay and LOTTO short for Linen On Top Then Overlay. OK, so centuries later, scientists come along and discover that the image is highly superficial, confined to the crowns of the threads, and possibly no deeper than the primary cell wall of flax fibres, approx 200nm thickness (or so we are told, though I have yet to see hard data on either that the TS image thickness). Our artisan did not need to know that, far less need special equipment or skills to follow those specifications. He was content to produce an image of the optimum intensity. The physics and chemistry of carbohydrate pyrolysis did the rest. It doesn’t matter how much complexity there is in the image at the microscopic level, it being something over which the artisan had no control, but more importantly had no need to control. There are different ways of cooking eggs – poaching, frying, boiling, omelettes etc. Nobody planned for those different offerings to look or taste the way they do. Their distinctive characteristics are the result of adopting simple operations with the eggs. Physics and chemistry does the rest. The TS image is likely to be end result of following a simple routine with prudent use of small scale temperature probes (test strips of linen) to minimise risk of under or over scorching. It is NOT the end result of a controlled laboratory experiment designed to effect certain changes at the microscopic level. To anyone who thinks otherwise I would simply say this.

Why go to that trouble or expense (unless one is Joseph of Arimathea, with an eye for quality, though carelessly omitting to check the label for C 14 content)? It may have been discovered through initial experimentation that the 3/1 weave gave a better end result than a simple 1/1. Why?

Yes, I know that Ian Wilson referred to the badge’s “blood belt”. But it’s odd, don’t you think, that none of the other blood motifs were shown (the small size need not have been an obstacle to showing nail holes, scourge marks etc). Might that not suggest that the badge maker had interpreted the “blood belt” as something very different, especially as it’s shown as a thick coil. Some of us (well, one anyway) see parallels with the potent imagery employed by extanct and earlier artists to depict the sufferings of St.Lawrence of Rome, slow roasted in 258, with a variety of restraining devices, including a rope or chain around the waist, with the subject spread eagled over the grid iron, occasionally with crossed hands as per TS. Oh, and there are those images of the Templars at the stake in 1314, some with a securing chain around the waist. Methinks it’s somewhat premature to assume that it really is a Wilsonian “blood belt”, especially as there’s no obvious lance wound on the Lirey badge. Conversely, the Lier copy (1516) of the TS shows a lance wound but NOT a “blood belt”. At the risk of stirring a hornet’s nest, one could be provocative (oh, let’s) and suggest there had been a puzzling feature of the Mark 1 TS, one that resembled a chain or coiled rope (which may or may not have provided a clue as to how the rest of the image was to be interpreted) and that later custodians simply covered up the problematical region with blood (or blood substitute).

But one should not assume that elemental aluminium does not exist anywhere in the Universe. It does – in stars – because it was formed in stars from lighter elements by nuclear capture of protons and electrons. The conditions are those of a high temperature plasma, which allows no chemical combinations, i.e. The aluminium would be present as aluminium atoms or ions, not as ionic associations with other elements, not even ion pairs (the temperature being too high). What we do with our electric current in aluminium smelters is to reverse the process that led to stellar aluminium atoms cooling by degrees to become chemically stable aluminium compounds in the Earth’s crust, That process required restoring electrons to aluminum ions, Al +++, converting them to Al atoms. The latter being electrically neutral with equal numbers of protons and electrons. It’s somewhat pointless (at least in the context of the TS) to get too spellbound about an ultra thin image layer when thin layers are commonplace in the world around us, albeit for very different mechanistic processes. It then becomes equally pointless but additionally tedious if one’s examples are then challenged for being ‘man made’ rather than natural. That’s especially the case with the example I cited of aluminium, where the distinction between natural and man made depends on whether one takes a planetary perspective, or that of the entire Universe with most places much hotter than Planet Earth. What we see here now is opportunist sniping verging (yet again) on trolling. But there’s some compensation this time, since I never pass up an opportunity to talk about the subject that has given me immense enjoyment for well over half a century – the chemical elements and their compounds – of which we ourselves are made, and our ability to rearrange atoms to concoct a wealth of fascinating compounds (or return the latter to their separate elements). Takeaway message: the thinness of a scorch image is no big deal, but if it were, then take comfort (or alarm) from the fact that there are potentially scores of other big deals around us in the form of ultra thin layers.

Rogers claimed that the coloration of TS image fibres was confined to a highly superficial layer that could be retained by his Mylar adhesive tape when the fibre was plucked out with forceps.

My flour imprints after washing with soap and water are faint, almost TS like one might say, but are still easily visible.

The same would have applied perhaps to Rogers, viewing highly light reflective linen fibres longitudinally. What if there was colour inside the fibres, but one was prevented from seeing it by the light reflecting/refracting properties of flax fibres that are polyhedrons (5 – 7 sides) in cross section? That would appear to be the problem, since the colour becomes easily visible when one views the fibres in cross section (the latter responds well to photo enhancement). No, I’m not going to display my microphotographs, thanks to the likes of that spivvy and insufferable Paolo Di Lazzaro who uses my pictures to make cheap shots at my expense about not knowing how to focus a microscope. He’ll have to find himself another fall guy if wishing to use this or other internet sites to further display his profound ignorance of photochemistry. Suffice it to say that the images one sees of thread cross sections and.or angled mountings may well help elucidate the nature of the half tone effect, discontinuities etc. Anyone here with a better microscope than mine (Hugh especially, judging by that recent picture of him with an upmarket binocular model) has only to to email me, and I’ll happily share with them my technique and preliminary pictures (no obligation) to do with as they wish.

There he writes “Because of his work on explosives, Ray Rogers was an eminent expert in thermal effects”. No, he wasn’t an expert in thermal effects generally, in the sense of understanding or being able to predict the complex sequence of chemical changes that can be initiated by heat (that being a vast area in which no one individual can hope to know it all). There seems to have been a misunderstanding on the part of John Heller, and probably the initiators of STURP generally. Ray Rogers chose DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) as a means of monitoring the kinetic stability of chemical explosives. It involved applying metered amounts of thermal energy (“heat”) and monitoring temperature change. Flat regions on the heat/temperature plot are referred to as “endotherms” which indicate where heat is being absorbed to break chemical bonds, the first step in chemical reaction, and in this instance explosive decomposition,.Those endotherms can be used to calculate kinetic parameters (notably activation energy) but it’s arguably more physics (or physical chemistry) than test tube chemistry. An expertise in DSC does NOT make one an expert in thermal breakdown pathways generally. It provides no data on detailed mechanism generally. Ray Rogers was pre eminent in his field of explosives stability testing. That expertise did NOT equip him to elucidate the mechanism by which the TS image was formed, whether thermal, chemical, or thermochemical. His elevation to role of chemical sainthood is sadly laughable to anyone with the briefest acquaintance with chemical science. That much becomes clear when one looks at the way his Pliny era “starch coating impurity” hypothesis is casually inserted into a pro authenticity narrative as if fact, with the terms starch, impure starch, crude starch, starch fractions, dextrins, reducing sugars being used interchangeably. Starch is starch. It does NOT spontaneously break down to dextrins and reducing sugars on ageing. The Rogers “starch impurity coating” may be correct, but the “sugar coated” extension of that hypothesis is/was palpable nonsense. Rogers was a gifted hands on chemist, but he became increasingly prone to mix speculation and fact post the STURP 1981 Summary, as did other ‘leading lights’. Group think? Maybe.

But a quick scan, so to speak, of the current debate leaves me with profound misgivings about there being credible grounds for dismissing the 14th century origin. Firstly, on reads that the sample was taken from a corner of the shroud (now that is credible, given the Vatican’s long refusal to have any of the cloth removed), and that highly peripheral location alone was used to cast doubt on the age. “A corner would have been have been handled by lots of people over the centuries, contaminating with progressively more modern carbon, making the fabric seem progressively younger”. OK, I’ll buy into that, albeit with some reluctance, and might have been content to wait for non destructive techniques to come on stream for examining more central areas of fabric. But now we are told that the sample was not the original fabric at all, that it was rewoven in that corner, and what’s more done so cleverly by French artisans that it is undetectable to the naked eye. Now that I find very difficult to swallow, and for two reasons. Firstly, why bother to invisibly repair any part of the shroud, given that there is major fire damage, and that initial repairs were crude, using triangular patches (since removed I gather)? Secondly, why go to the trouble of invisibly repairing a corner of the cloth, leaving those major holes elsewhere? Sorry, but there seems an element of fancy footwork here, first to say that a somewhat inconsequential and atypical corner of the fabric was used that had maybe become contaminated, and then to suggest that the same remote corner of the shroud was the site for the most meticulous repair damage, while making no attempt to restore the major damaged areas. What I consider extraordinary is that it is the application of 20th/21st century science – pushed to its limits of reliability using minute fabrics of cloth that the Vatican has grudgingly allowed to be taken – that is being used to promulgate the idea that the shroud is 1st century, indeed that of Christ’s, when the Vatican itself makes no such claim, and indeed has never done so in the entire period since its 14th century coming to notice. As for the Italian scientists who have taken time off from their day jobs recently to fuel further speculation in the mass media with their tendentious claims of ultraviolet light as a proxy for some even more miraculous process, words fail me.

If one fails to pursue and secure a verdict on the grounds that it will always be challenged, especially by those with a prior and entrenched presumption of guilt or innocence, then why bother with forensic testing? Indeed, why bother with courts of law? Repeat the testing. If nothing else, it will eliminate doubts as to statistical repeatability, based on the sampling from just the one corner, or those based on the suggestion that the existing data show a linear trend that, if repeated the entire length of the Shroud, could undermine the medieval provenance implied by 1260 1390. The neutron irradiation/C 14 thesis from Antonacci and others, while ingenious, is not a reason for not re testing. Who would bother doing any science if all that was needed to block a needed test was someone popping up with “what if?” scenarios?

That was a slip of the memory on my part. Re toasting bread, you are again correct, well, sort of, but only in an exceedingly narrow sense that would seem to have little or no bearing on the nature of the Shroud image (unless you are saying that the emitting body was itself red hot). With actual physical contact and conduction there can be an intense scorch, but if one has the slightest air gap there is none whatsoever. However, it one were to contrive a means of placing some linen into a toaster, e.g. By attaching a square to a slice of white bread, then one would indeed see the linen scorch as well as the bread (I’ve done the experiment). It would be a diffuse scorch, one that was not confined to the thread crowns (as per Shroud) and one would not expect to see any well defined imaging, e.g. Of the red hot electric elements. So why is there radiation scorching under these extreme conditions? It’s because of the Boltzmann distribution of emitted frequencies. To get enough emission of visible red light for an element to glow red hot, one needs an incandescent element that is at 750 degrees C or higher. But there is so much intense (albeit) invisible infrared radiation accompanying that visible light that even the slightest opacity and absorption by linen (or bread) is enough to cause absorption and scorching. In other words – scorching by radiation is possible in the immediate vicinity of INCANDESCENT bodies, emitting huge amounts of infrared radiation. Incidentally, bread in that above experiment produces an attractive golden bown toast colour, which is primarily a Maillard reaction product between carbohydrate and protein. The scorched linen will be a darker, less attractive colour, since lacking as it does appreciable amounts of protein, the scorching is via pyrolysis of polysaccharides alone, i.e. Hemicellulose and cellulose to produce dehydrated, oxidised, cross linked products. The principle of minor/mimimal absorption of radiation building additively to produce near total absorption is seen in storm clouds. Each individual droplet of water is almost transparent to visible white light. But if sunlight tries to pass through millions of suspended droplets then most of it is finally absorbed so as to make the cloud look grey or black to an observer on the ground. But we would still say that water is transparent to light as a general rule of thumb. There are always exceptions that prove (test) the rule. It is not difficult to see why the miracle school of shroud imagery likes to invoke visible light, ultraviolet or x rays, studiously ignoring the copious amounts of infrared radiation that generally accompany them in the real world of conventional physics. Given the relative proportions of the different wavelengths,it is the infrared component that would be the first to scorch or toast any organic material in sight – with no pretty images being formed…. Scorching by direct contact on the other hands DOES produce images (“branding”), and they are light/dark reversed, and they are superficial,or can be, and show encoded 3 D information, and, as said earlier they are confined initially to the the crowns of the threads. More boring old conventional chemistry and physics… But scorching by direct contact would destroy the mystery, would it not, and Russ Breault would have nothing left for his Magical Mystery Tour road show. Which I see has been updated to include the side splitting media reports from Di Lazzaro and those other ENSA clowns….","date":"2012-03-07","mins":"5:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-9022","author":"colin_berry","post":"You won’t be seeing any artefacts from me, Ron – beyond the small ones I have reported already (to demonstrate the scientific principles, to wit, scorching by direct contact with a hot surface to produce a superficial pseudo negative with encoded 3 D information).

One might as well claim that it’s impossible to brush against an electric iron without risking a third degree burn. There are at least 4 variables that can be independently controlled to get a light scorch affecting the most superficial part of a linen fibre – temperature, application pressure, application time, and presence or absence of a cool and/or damp underlay to act as heat sink. I have today reproduced an earlier experiment with some better controls – the one that showed one can selectively scorch a sheet of onion epidermis – just one cell thick – with no appreciable effect on an underlying sheet of linen. Superficiality is NOT a problem, neither in theory nor practice. Let’s move on shall we? As for radiation, it’s simply a non starter (although that has not deterred the distractionists and obscurantists from constantly invoking it is as the “likely” or “most promising” model, basically because it serves the purpose of further mystifying the Shroud, instead of demystifying. Radiation is ruled out for the simple reason that production of electromagnetic waves by some miraculous process does not result in an image if there is no focusing or collimating system in place. Neither is there any known means of producing ultraviolet radiation or x rays from a non incandescent or non irradiated material, e,g, a corpse, and even low energy infrared and visible light have their problems – they cannot scorch if there is nothing to absorb them. There’s a basic law of physics – no absorption, no action – and there’s still the absence of lens, mirrors etc to bring to a focus. Yup, it’s a scorch, and a superficial one, at least initially, affecting the thread crowns, and that is a signature of a contact scorch, probably from hot metal – but that’s not what folk want to hear. No problem if it’s ordinary folk – it being a free country.

There are so many other evidences on the Shroud opposing it being a fraud. The linen itself, most definately not of medieval manufacture, anatomically correct blood flows depicting precise crucifixion angles, scourge wounds identical to a Roman whip not seen since the 4th century etc; etc; All this and what you say makes no difference as all you have to accomplish is to scourch linen equally across the whole image to a depth of .0002 and only on the very top surfaces of the fibrels. This image must also show to be 3d under a vp 8 image analyzer and have a reasonably realistic quality when seen as a positive and I would say your point would be proven! If I missed anything here guys don;t be afraid to chime in, but that is all I think is needed to prove your hypothsis atleast making it porbable. What do you think of that Colin? R There’s too much there to answer succinctly, and a lot of those points have been addressed before. But to take just three: Superficiality of image: the 200nm thickness corresponds to the outermost primary cell wall (PCW) with loosely packed hemicellulose and cellulose fibrils. There are good theoretical grounds for thinking those exposed and vulnerable polysaccharides can be selectively scorched without affecting the underlying secondary cell wall with its highly ordered chemically resistant cellulose. One can selectively scorch a sheet of dried onion epidermis – just one cell thick two PC Ws – with no scorching of underlying linen, as I reported recently. Only the top surface of threads, and of a few fibrils? Yup, that is the signature of scorching by contact with a hot surface, as in ancient branding technology. It’s scorching by contact/conduction that allows one to achieve that kind of superficiality, which is impossible with any kind of radiation, which gives a more diffuse coloration. 3 D encoding: there is no mystery there. All the scorch images I have produced respond to 3 D software. So did the 1532 burns, and so did the bas relief models in Jackson’s experiments. One can quibble about this or that detail, but who is to say that the Shroud image is closer to the appearance of the imaged subject than any other. 3 D imaging is simply knob twiddling. There is no science there whatsoever if you have no definite information as to how the original image was formed. 3 D images can be made to look really seductive in the hands of a true artist. Merely arranging to get an oblique viewing angle as if paying one’s respects to reclining deceased loved one can undermine strict scientific objectivity….","date":"2012-03-07","mins":"4:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-9048","author":"colin_berry","post":"“..not only did you scorch thru the single layer onion skin but you actually scorched the linen somewhat, take a good look again. Does this give you any ideas?” I’m not sure how you arrived at that Ron. You are aware, aren’t you, that I left an unpeeled section of the onion epidermis in place, corresponding with the centre screw on the template (an aluminium pencil sharpener)? Or as your referring to the exceedingly faint yellow cast on the linen? I doubt very much if that is a scorch. It is more likely a film of caramelised onion. I could launder that bit of linen to confirm, but is it worth it? Do you not consider it remarkable that one can produce a heavy scorch on something just one cell thick, with virtually no effect on the underlying linen? Yet a lot of heat transfers through, as i know from using a damp underlay, and seeing the steam coming up. Provided one does not overdom the temperature, the bulk of the cellulose survives virtually intact. There is little doubt in my mind that a clear distinction needs to be drawn between cellulose crystallites in the secondary cell walls (highly stable) and more reactive and superficial polysaccharides in the PCW. Rogers to his credit grasped that point through seeing the presence of the image in a detachable film under the microscope. He tried to link it with starch and Saponaria acquired in processing, the latter having pentosan sugars, but it was later authors who realized that the outermost layer of linen fibres is the primary cell wall, and that the latter has very loosely packed hemicellulose (with reactive pentose sugars) and non crystalline cellulose. There is a clear rationale here for selective scorching of a very thin superficial layer(200nm) as a consequence of both botanical and chemical factors. So it’s pointless arguing that a forger had achieved an impossible degree of precision if it is the layered coaxial structure of each and every linen fibre that gives rise to the phenomenon of highly superficial scorching. It would be like a fireman marvelling that the insulation had been selectively burned off electrical wiring while the copper cores remained intact….","date":"2012-03-07","mins":"5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-8968","author":"colin_berry","post":"As i’ve said elsewhere, fluorescence may be a characteristic of a fresh scorch, but if you don’t know the precise fluorochrome(s) responsible, the conditions that favour their formation, their stability with age or history of exposure to fluorescence quenching agents, then you cannot hold them up as some kind of be all and end all – it’s simply unscientific to seize on things that one does not understand – and I include myself in that. As for 3 D images, the 1532 burns also show “encoded 3 D information”, so did John Jackson’s bas relief , and so has every scorch I have produced on linen. So called 3 D encoding is not just a characteristic of scorches – the very act of creating one with a 3 D object that has contours and different contact pressure points makes it an ideal subject for that kind of relief imprinting. What do the radiationists have to offer re 3 D encoding? Nothing. I repeat – nothing – it’s all empty rhetoric, intellectually bankrupt obscurantism. Yes, there may be tweaking required here and there to reproduce the precise degree of fidelity v distortion – but why make a fetish of the technical details. What matters are the scientific principles – unless one is using technical perfectionism as a means of obstructing progress and understanding – and it’s now abundantly clear to me that quite a number of so called scientists have been doing just that. Who says the scorch does not, or did not, affect the blood. Rogers’ “data” on that scarcely qualifies for that description, being cobbled together tendentious ad hoc untried and untested methodology that was presented as if it were the last word on the matter.

Maybe you can explain to me why dehydrated/oxidized/crosslinked components on the Shroud are non fluorescent while similar looking scorches from the 1532 fire are. If you can’t, then I would suggest that it is you who is engaged in a cop out in trying to avoid getting involved at anything more than the most superficial level with something where you don’t have the chemical background .I don’t hold a lack of chemical background against you, but I can’t say as I care for internet dilettantes who take the tools of science and then proceed to crudely weaponise them, turning them on scientists who dare to question your orthodoxy. I am not at all impressed. In fact, if the truth be told, I am hugely bored and underwhelmed with this kind of ritualistic sniping.that substitutes for genuine open ended research and scholarship. Rogers test for heated blood was bizarre in the extreme. It was based on whether the blood lost hydroxyproline on heating. Fact: hydroxyproline is a solid, non volatile amino acid, so how can it be lost on heating? Fact: there are only traces of hydroxyproline in the blood, this unusual modified amino acid being a breakdown product of connective tissue, mainly collagen. It has been described as a marker in the meat industry for just that – for meat, for heated meat – i.e. Muscle/connective tissue – not heated blood. Inappropriate off the shelf methodology? There is also the small point that the Shroud “blood” is so highly degraded by age that it scarcely qualifies for that description anyway. Rogers few words on that heating test are written in a highly peremptory, some might say tetchy manner. One might suspect he was scraping the barrel for arguments against the image being a scorch, and that the scorch suggestion was not one to which he was enamoured – but had no alternative to offer. I rather fear that he was getting frustrated and/or losing his scientific objectivity at that point in his career. Indeed, one has to ask what it was that motivated an explosives chemist without clinical pathology experience (that I am aware of) to make so drastic a shift in career focus. You are someone else who likes to bandy around the “peer review” mantra – another example of weaponising the scientific method to attack science. Having myself peer reviewed scores of papers, and been on the receiving end too naturally, i can tell you that it is generally only the grossest of errors that are detected by a referee, who usually has to take a great deal on trust (like that bizarre hydroxyproline test). Never could that be truer than a situation in which a handful of individuals have privileged access to a few fragments or threads of material, and who are forced to adopt often unconventional visual micro spotting techniques which yield little or non quantitative data, and where the reporting and interpretation of results looks somewhat impressionistic to say the least. OK, this is the internet, and I expect the flak as soon as I put my head above the parapet. You may score points with this or that debating point, but you will not undermine the intuition, confidence and nose for a bum claim that 50 years of study, research and teaching have given me in the chemical and biochemical sciences. Yours and others knocking copy – Dan’s especially (I’ve gone right off Dan) is simply water off a duck’s back. Start making some genuine scientific points and I might feel more inclined to talk to you, rather than at you… You and Dan may be pleased to know that I am fast running out of things to say on this site. It would have been nice to hear back from Dr.Di Lazzaro after I told him what I thought of his heated coin test, and of my own (I consider) better designed experiments using a range of temperatures chosen empirically to give light scorching, and latterly with a better heat sink than the initial moist sand, and not forgetting the onion epidermis model etc. And I’d still like to know, before signing off, in what way I have been “misleading” in the few words I have spoken regarding that John Jackson work with the hot metal. ..","date":"2012-03-05","mins":"7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/you-must-be-kidding-colin-berry/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"You must be kidding, Colin Berry"}]
