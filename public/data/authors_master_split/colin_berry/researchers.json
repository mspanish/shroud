I refer to the chain, best seen on the dorsal side, that is not just across the waist, but extends left and right, as if showing a chain shackled figure. Now I know that he or his artist is said to have misinterpreted a catenated blood stain as a chain. But why show it extending beyond the body outline, and looking for all the world like a chain with regularly spaced links, given there is no evidence of a chain figuring in the Biblical account of the last hours of Christ, nor, as far as I am aware, of a chain figuring as a symbol of the Passion elsewhere in Western art (or Eastern for that matter). I have my own theory re the chain, one that although somewhat iconoclastic is not entirely original, which I have quietly published elsewhere, attracting little interest or attention.

What iis assumed to be blood may not necessarily be real blood, and any real blood on the Shroud, in various degrees of chemical degradation, may not necessarily have been on the Shroud at the instant of image production. (In other words, one must not assume that the failure to find an image under one bloodstain means that all areas showing “blood” have no underlying image). To put it crudely – there may have been touching up with blood over the centuries – or with red or brown pigments that could be mistaken for blood. It is a very difficult area, and one that needs detailed information on precisely what was done in the past by those STURP investigators, as distinct from the sketchy accounts that are available on the internet. I’m hoping that Mario Latendresse’s Shroud Scope might at least help in identifying “suspect” area of bloodstaining. Incidentally, did you see my final conclusion re the Pray Codex, or rather the crucial image (see link to image) showing where the Shroud ends and the sarcophagus lid starts?

The image has survived despite the passage of hundreds of years and it being subjected to all kinds of damaging elements. I would think that if the staining fluid was the last finishing touch, then it would have offered a protective cover to whatever image that laid under it. Have you taken a look at the “bloodstains” on the Shroud, e.g. With Mario Latendresse’s Shroud Scope? Many are indistinguishable from those of skin, hair etc – a far cry from any notion that they can be peeled off with forceps – since they are just a coloration on the most superficial parts of the weave. Nothing is certain, far less predictable in surface chemistry, not when you are dealing with highly superficial layers that are in the micron region of thickness or less, where gaseous diffusion or any other kind of access or penetration is not the rate limiting factor.

You refer to ‘the chemical signature of dehydrated cellulose”. First, we don’t know if it’s dehydrated cellulose or hemicellulose – but is more likely to be the latter, something that Rogers did not consider, or at any rate comment on. The changes that carbohydrates undergo on mild pyrolysis are exceedingly subtle, and the eye is in fact far better at picking up surface pyrolysis that any amount of chemical instrumentation. Likewise the signature of heated or age degraded blood is by no means a straightforward one, which is why we saw Alan Adler switching from testing for haemoglobin to testing for hydrazine solubilized iron free porphyrins, and being largely content to characterise those porphyrins by their uv/visible or fluorescence spectra which does not constitute conclusive evidence for anything. And let’s not forget that some say the only signature that aged blood would leave after centuries is iron oxide which puts a question mark over claims that the blood stains are AB group or test positively for albumin etc. And there’s Adler’s admission that his bloodstains did not contain potassium or other physiological cations or anions that should act as a signature of even the most degraded blood: his explanations in terms of haemolysis, clot retraction etc groaned under a load of qualifying assumptions, something that was sadly all too symptomatic of STURP science. I’d describe alleged bloodstains on the Shroud as a can of worms, except that a can of worms would be far easier to work with.

This proves that the image color is not a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen. Some impurities on the surface of the different batches of yarn produced the image color. This observation is extremely important when tests are being made on image formation hypotheses. If image color is not simply a result of color formation in the cellulose of the linen fibers, image formation must be a much more complex process than we originally though.” See also point 13 on Page 15: “The medullas of colored image fibers are not colored: The cellulose was not involved in color production.” (Rogers’ own italics) Do try and keep up, Mr.Ironclad… Oh, and do your own googling in future before casting nasturtiums, as my mother used to say ….","date":"2012-06-20","mins":"1:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12779","author":"colin_berry","post":"But he was not doing good science, as that sentence you quote in bold shows.

There are so many unknowns that could have generated a false positive. For example, did you know there are proteins in the cells of flax linen?

You wrote; “A chemist who knows of the existence of hemicelluloses, and has indeed mentioned them briefly as being more reactive than cellulose, would and should not have written that sentence, referring only to cellulose.” And yet, by your own admission, this contention about not involving the hemicellulose is a moot point since, axiomatically, the color is not due to a chemical reaction within the fibers, which if it was, would have also affected hemicellulose, not just the cellulose. This explains why further elaborations concerning the fibers were not considered. This, this also throws asunder the other statement you made in a posting dated June 14 @ 3:12 PM, viz: “we don’t know of it’s dehydrated cellulose or hemicellulose.” The fact of the matter is that we DO know the image was not due to chemical changes of the fibers.

Why would he or his artist have interpreted any markings on the Shroud as a chain, and moreover a chain that is being used to shackle, i.e. To constrain an individual, preventing escape? Crucifixion by nailing is sufficient surely to constrain and prevent escape… There are other points one could make about the somewhat bizarre Lirey badge – e.g. That the figure depicted does not look at all Christ like, certainly not like the one on the Shroud – one that is supposed to have served as the basis for latter day representations of Christ with long hair, beard, and with a resigned pose, that of someone who had anticipated what was in store etc. The figure shown on the Lirey badge looks anything but resigned to his fate..","date":"2012-06-12","mins":"1:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"id":"comment-12338","author":"colin_berry","post":"Paul, it may seem strange, counter intuitive even, but any quick sketch that one does with a soft pencil or charcoal is likely to resemble a photographic negative more so than a positive.

The pro will make the nose very light, because being prominent it reflects a lot of light, whereas the amateur makes it dark – simply because it’s prominent – without a thought to its light reflecting properties. In short, it’s only good professional art that resembles a photographic positive. We amateurs content ourselves with near negatives. However, the effect of converting any ‘pseudo negative’ to a photographic light dark reversed positive can be startling (as Secondo Pia discovered in 1898). Here’s a link to a post I did a few weeks ago starting with a quick B/W sketch of a man’s face with charcoal. When it was B/W inverted (pseudo negative to positive) then the end result had a luminous ghostly quality, and even responded magnificently to a little 3 D enhancement. That’s due to harsh features being made light, while conversely white space becomes promoted to shadow like soft greys. It looks like magic, or at any rate a conjuring trick, but is really just physics. So the point I am making is that while there may be much speculation as to how the pseudo negative Shroud image came into being (and much misreporting of its stunning transformation by light/dark reversal) there is really nothing strange or unusual about amazing pseudo negative to positive transformation as such, even if Pia was the first to discover the effect.

Given that oxidation is a chemical process, the rate and extent of reaction is influenced by any number of environmental factors – light, oxygen, catalysts, atmospheric pollutants, moisture etc etc. So how can vanillin content tell one whether a fabric is 500 years old or 2000 years old?

Rogers was operating ‘out of area’ – and if the truth be told was taking huge liberties, especially with his cobbled together short cut methodology with poorly documented one off spot tests using non standard reagents and procedures (e.g. Iodine/azide or pyrolytic mass spectrometry for “starch”). As far as I am aware he never once tested for the presence of those “saponins”, being content to say that Pliny had described their use, and assuming they must be present on the Shroud, conveniently bumping up the content of “reducing sugar” needed for his purely hypothetical Maillard reaction (but not bothering with tedious old numbers)..

It’s time the Roman Catholic church stopped insulting the intelligence of those of us who see the TS primarily as an interesting medieval artefact, with absolutely no hard evidence to suggest it is otherwise. The Vatican and Turin custodians are playing a dishonorable cat and mouse game.

If it’s subsequently proved genuine, then display the ‘vandalized’ half in a science museum to serve as a permanent monument to the arrogance of science. Somehow I can’t see that happening.

Yes, the iron oxide/acid is to serve as simulated sweat you realize, but of medieval provenance (we at least agree on something). Oh, and the blood too has got to look like real blood, even if it too is simulated, or partly so. If the aim was to create something that looked like a real body imprint (life size, frontal v dorsal, no sides, no shadowing, NO loin cloth, quality linen etc etc) then would it not make more sense to dispense with the services of that truly adventurous, avant garde artist, and employ one or more artisans to generate REAL BODY IMPRINTS, one where there’s little if any chance of sceptics pointing a finger and saying “Just who do you think you are kidding – that’s just a faint painting, made to look like an imprint!” This investigator will continue to plough his now ever lonelier furrow.

Welcome to the site – and thanks for your focused comment (even if I disagree with the general thrust). Have you seen my current posting? https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/pro authenticity shroud investigators should have considered the body image as a simulated sweat imprint before rushing to their pseudoscience resurrectional incandescence etc/ There I make a claim that the TS body image is NOT a photograph, far less an August Accetta X ray radiograph. It’s an ‘impactograph’. As such, I’d be more than happy for the body image to show “teeth” (while unable to see them myself). Why? Because anything that’s hard and resistant to pressure (bone, teeth etc) assists with transfer of an imprinting medium from skin to linen. My imprinting medium (Model 10) is not liquid, incidentally, at least not initially. It’s solid particles of white flour, imprinted onto wet linen. But there is still a role for liquid, albeit transient, which assists in explaining so called image superficiality (still to be properly measured see below!) and the microscopic properties (image discontinuities, evenness of colour within individual fibres etc). I believe that a flour imprint ‘bleeds’ a briefly liquid thermal exudate on thermal colour development of a flour imprint over a bed of medieval hot charcoal embers. The liquid cocktail (Maillard browning products, melanoidins etc) actually penetrates fibres, so the image – far from being confined to the surface actually penetrates beneath the PCW (primary cell wall) into the lignified S1 layer underneath. There’s far too much dogma re “image superficiality” in my view, despite precious little by way of hard data.

I ceased using wet flour paste in Model 9, replacing it with sprinkled solid white flour, as shown yet again in this posting. And no, I do not imprint onto cotton, but linen. Cementation is not an issue since, as shown in this blog’s banner, the Stage 1 roasted flour imprints from the oven are routinely washed vigorously with soap and water to detach the initial encrustation of Maillard browning products, leaving a faint Shroud like discoloration of the fibres only.

One thing I did not appreciate until recently (that might have caused some hesitation in pushing the Templar/barbecue link) is my belated realization that the Shroud in post medieval Europe was perceived – at least by some contemporaries – as a “sweat imprint” – i.e. A full body sized version of the Veil of Veronica (see a previous posting re “SUAIRE” on the Machy mould for a variant of the Lirey Pilgrims’ badge). Suppose a medieval forger, starting with a blank sheet of linen (instead of a pre existing scorch, still my preferred scenario), had wanted to simulate a sweat imprint, one that was fairly faint and yellowed, but importantly still a negative image to convey the idea of imprinting off 3 D features. What kind of chemicals might he have employed? If you want to develop a new “chemical imprint” model, you have to think like a medieval (proto)chemist, with jars and vials, full of corrosive or smelly liquids, as distinct from blacksmith with a forge and bellows.

And Some Comments."},{"id":"comment-166679","author":"colin_berry","post":"OK. Here’s a quick checklist reply to those questions. Problems with the Rogers’ hypothesis: 1. There’s been no definitive evidence that I’m aware of for an even coating of starch capable of giving a homogeneous image. All we have is spot test evidence, and even that is unconvincing when it relies on reagents intended for other tests (like iodine/azide reagent for sulpho proteins). 2. Even if there were that even coating of starch, that does not provide the reducing sugars required for a Maillard reaction. Referring to “starch fractions” or “dextrins” is hardly helpful. Each starch fragment would supply only one reducing aldehydic end group, and what is the agent that is miraculously breaking up the starch into an amenable population of short fragments? 3.. There’s no strong grounds fore thinking that a corpse would produce decomposition amines in so uniform a distribution as to produce a homogenous image. 4. There are all the problems of expecting amine vapours to produce images across air gaps, requiring all kinds of qualifying assumptions about short diffusion paths, laminar flow etc.. 5. Imaging of hair is problematical. The notion that hair would “trap” amines from the skin at high concentration is less than convincing. 6. Maillard reactions are favoured by high temperature. Generally the higher the better. It’s not simply a matter of kinetics, where a 10 degrees C rise in temperature generally doubles the rate of reaction. At the maximum temperatures that one can envisage in a rock tomb the rates of reaction between amines and.or proteins and reducing sugars is minuscule, so when one reads that a 10 degree rise gives far more than a doubling of rate, that is meaningless if the rate is negligible. It also suggests the reaction is not under simple kinetic control (see wiki entry on kinetic v thermodynamic control), and is slow due to marginal feasibility in energetic terms. Why is the system so sensitive to small increases in temperature (while having negligible effect on yield)? Answer: because the system is probably under thermodynamic instead of (or in addition to) kinetic control. Maillard reactions are barely feasible at low temperature due to unfavourable Gibbs free energy change, which is probably due to unfavourable order/disorder (entropy) change. Yes, this para is long, because the concept are tricky, and are still the subject of model building requiring detailed knowledge of reaction pathways and higher mathematics. 7. While glucose is not the most reactive of the reducing sugars in model Maillard reactions with ammonia, casein etc, and while pentose sugars perform better, as Thibault Heimburger has pointed out, that’s hardly relevant if (a) the absolute rates of reaction are still tiny, giving negligible yields, say at 50 55 degrees C, i.e. A highly optimistic scenario. And (b) there is no obvious source of those 5 carbon sugars, except by invoking the presence of saponins, say, (also highly conjectural, indeed agenda driven speculation) and supposing there is some means for degrading those pentosan polymers to their individual monosaccharide sugars. Complex scenario? These points are merely the tip of an iceberg if the aim is to produce a recognizable negative image of a 6 foot individual on both frontal and dorsal surfaces, with no hints anywhere of sides or top of head. In short, the TS image is too stylized to have arisen as a fortuitous set of physical, chemical and biological circumstances. If it had happened once, with near perfect outcome, one would have expected to see in numerous other situations involving shroud enveloped corpses. Maybe with a less perfect outcome, but the stuff of folk lore all the same..","date":"2014-10-29","mins":"5:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/29/an-apology-to-colin-berry-and-some-comments/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"An Apology to Colin Berry.

It’s about my right to have expressed my view on the matter not only when the ‘no conferring’ details were first announced many moons ago but after the event was over, all the participants were back home, when Dan Porter was describing the ecstatic response to one particular OTT paper involving magical neutrons and posting a big Thank You here to the ‘conference’ organizer. To say the response to my criticism, admittedly scathing on two separate grounds (the type of papers permitted, the lack of any formal opportunity to lodge a protest against pseudo science), was ferocious is an understatement. Dan Porter condemned me in no uncertain terms, stating that my using his Thank You posting to say what I did would be remembered here with resentment or a long long time. (Odd. I thought this was an open to all forum, not a tight family circle). In other words the issue is or was no longer about the reasonableness or otherwise of my views, but my right to express them when and where I did. So it’s NOT about St.Louis anymore (and no, David, I would not have attended even if there had been Discussion slots, there being much else about the ‘look’ of the thing, notably the begging the question title, that frankly I found a bit of a turn off). It’s now about free speech. It’s only re appearing now because I have become aware of a big chill that took tangible form, like having my comments pre moderated for no good reason that I could see. Then came the appearance of the child at play graphic which was the last straw (having been thus portrayed on at least one previous occasion) so I thank Dan for the apology and its removal. The pre moderation has been lifted, but I sense that the embargo on free speech remains, that this site has invisible red lines that one crosses at one’s peril. There is also the tolerance shown towards one or two contributors who have set me and other sceptics up as hate figures, and who have slipped into a troll like modus operandi. One sometimes wonders if they are capable of seeing themselves as other do. Repeat: it’s about free speech – a non negotiable right in my view when it’s confined to issues, including those that some may resent being raised, who see it as criticism of their views and actions (which it may be, but without being ad hom). ‘Free speech’ only become problematical when it’s an obsession with particular individuals for what they are perceived to represent (anti authenticity spoilers?) making it near impossible to engage in calm debate on matters of technical detail. At the risk of stating the obvious: this retired biochemist is only here for the science, real science, the untainted curiosity driven as distinct from the narrative or agenda driven fixated variety. I frankly fail to see why I should make the slightest effort to conceal my strong dislike of anything that smacks of narrative driven science, or even my total loathing of agenda driven pseudo science. (Example, just one that some here will resent being articulated: Ray Rogers was a fine chemist, but he went spectacularly off the scientific rails with his first allusion to Pliny and starch/saponin impurity coatings. As a STURP team leader he was supposed to be probing claims re authenticity v non authenticity – not taking one or other side while still seen post 1982 as a spokesman for STURP).

All I’d say is this: Some years ago, 2006 to be precise, a particular journalist/staff blogger for the Telegraph on French affairs attracted a francophile following to his blogs, myself included. When he was “let go” by his employers, many of us abandoned the DT staff blogs altogether, and did two things: we set up our own blogs (mine being Dreams and Daemons) and commented freely on the ex staffer’s blog (“Salut!”) and others within the circle. Whether prompted by that or not I don’t know, but the DT responded the following year by setting up the award winning and innovative My Telegraph (I was involved along with a few others in beta testing). That site allows anyone to post their own blogs and receive comments. Maybe that’s a possible model for those on the Washington Post to have a hived off community site, one which does not slow down or drown out serious on topic comment. Having said that, My Telegraph (which I abandoned a while ago for reasons we don’t need to go into) now has a hard core following of probably no more than 30 or 40 regulars, is not promoted by the management, and probably seems cliquish to anyone who stumbles on it by accident.

What’s more the removal of lignin from wood in papermaking relies on that same reaction between SO2/HSO3 and free aldehyde functions. I’m sure I need hardly tell you that there is more than one way in which SO2 etc could have come into contact with the Shroud in its early history. It could have been used perhaps to bleach yarn (it’s the classic method for bleaching straw hats with their high lignin content, though I’m less certain about its effects on linen). Alternatively, someone may have burned sulphur candles in the vicinity of the Shroud – known from antiquity as a means par excellence for fumigation to kill insects and their larvae etc. Someone here was saying just a day or two ago that Rogers’ chemical clock was just as accurate as radiocarbon dating.

In other words, we were allowed to have any scorch we liked, provided it’s a Rogers’ approved chemical “scorch”. Ray Rogers, to put it mildly. Showed a distinct pro authenticity bias and was clearly piqued when the radiochemical dating was announced. Maybe you consider my saying that to be “personal” or disrespectful to a dead scientist.

Here’s a passage from his FAQ (pdf) with frequent references to “we” so refers to his thought processes presumably while still in close contact with fellow STURP members, probably prior to 1988/89. “From Page 13/19 from his FAQ “The Shroud is a structure composed of chemical compounds, and all of the main ones have been studied in detail. They are published in chemical text books. Chemical analyses can yield considerable definitive historical information. All manipulations of the Shroud should be considered in detail in order to preserve as much information as possible. Linen production technology has changed through the centuries. We have assembled chemical information related to the technology, and we have consulted textile experts who have done detailed chemical research that relates to the composition of the Shroud. Our detailed analyses suggested that the cloth had been prepared by technology common before about AD 1200. It best resembles linen made in the Near East during Roman times. These results do not agree with the date published in 1989.” So here was a chemist relying on vague poorly or undocumented evidence re “linen technology”, referring presumably to bleaching practices, those starch coatings etc, on which to go speculating on a Roman era provenance, Leaving aside the propriety of using such wishy washy ill defined evidence on which to go speculating about age, that final reference to “Roman” and “Near East” strikes me as evidence of systematic bias in his thinking about the Shroud’s age, so yes, I do think that Rogers’ reactions on hearing the radiocarbon date would be one of pique. He also had a heavy investment in his impurity coating idea, linked to Pliny quoted Biblical era technology, since without that, and apparently unaware of the PCW, he had nowhere else to go except in the direction of Maillard or other allegedly low temperature chemistry which of course was all part of an authenticity narrative..","date":"2014-02-04","mins":"6:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/31/colin-berry-on-rogers-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Colin Berry on Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"id":"comment-76675","author":"colin_berry","post":"Jmarino240 : You changed from “was clearly piqued when the radiochemical dating was announced” to “…I do think that Roger’s reactions on hearing the radiocarbon date would be one of pique.” You went from stating a fact to stating a speculation.

You used the phrase “strikes me as evidence of systematic bias in his thinking about the Shroud’ s age,” which again is just speculation on your part. You never even met the man. You’re making assumptions about him with only your beliefs to back them up. Rogers was a man of integrity. When Sue and I made our hypothesis about the invisible reweave, Rogers considered us part of the “lunatic fringe.” How hard do you think it was for him to come out publicly to say he believed we were right? Very few scientists would have done that. It’s too bad he’s still not here to defend himself about the statements being made about him.. At this point, I think I’ve spent quite enough time on this exchange. With respect, it is you who is now going beyond the evidence (which is easy I grant you to do in the heat of the moment and an occupational hazard of posting online in real time). You have slipped in that term “integrity”. (“Rogers was a man of integrity”). When have I ever questioned the man’s integrity? I have no recollection of doing so, in the sense that he would deliberately set out to collect or disseminate data that he knew were wrong. What I have suggested is that he betrayed an underpinning bias (“preference”, “leaning” etc etc in common parlance) which is something entirely different, a human attribute that we are all prone to and which silently and unobtrusively kills science stone dead. He displayed that when he suddenly began (mis)quoting Pliny and lumbering the Shroud literature with his references to starch coatings, saponins etc etc, displaying a total blind spot for the PCW, and frankly derailing the entire STURP project as far as image chemistry was concerned. Nope, I don’t question his integrity. I condemn his embrace of a paradigm that had scarcely a fact to support it (which did not seem to greatly trouble him). It favoured authenticity, at least place and time (Near East, Roman era) because of his inability to step outside of a fundamental pro authenticity bias. And that I am afraid is what Rogers – and quite a few other of the largely self selected STURP did – they killed the image (AND blood) science stone dead through their BIAS, through taking authenticity as the default position, through wasting time and effort on excluding the TS as a painting when the focus should have been on investigating its resemblance to negative photographic image, and through premature and highly unrealistic SELF INDULGENT model building (aka building castles in the sky).

You will note that I said there was more to come, and you have correctly anticipated the key question, namely, that no matter what deficiencies exist in the underlying methodology or its reporting, that need not detract from the paper’s final conclusions, namely that there is a clear difference in Shroud linen, relative to Holland cloth etc, that can be linked to the age as determined by the lignin characteristics. Tell me this. What is the use of a clock that is either running, or has stopped completely? That is the situation with the Shroud linen. We are asked to believe that it’s the absence of Wiesner reactive lignin that is the reason, ie that it is incredibly aged. Sorry, I don’t buy that. The “vanillin clock” is so poorly documented that I decline to believe that the absence of a positive test is necessarily to do with age. It could be due to any number of factors – other than age – that affected the Shroud before 1534 (approx) when the Holland cloth was attached. To patch the burn holes. What about those references to earlier attempts to test the permanence of the Shroud image by boiling in oil etc? (Sorry, do not have links to hand) They could have oxidised the more susceptible coniferaldehyde end groups of lignin too, resulting in a negative Wiesner test. (Coniferaldehyde – note – with 3 carbon propanal side chain – NOT vanillin as stated by Rogers which is 1 carbon only). Sorry, but Rogers went looking for data to support a preconception, and filtered out anything that did not suit. That’s agenda driven science.

How is it possible to write : “I perceive the Shroud of Turin [is as] being in essence a thought experiment, imagining the effect of removing a victim, condemned to burning at the stake, while newly deceased but before substantial incineration, and placing in an up and over Shroud. The “hot” victim then leaves a scorch like body imprint on both surfaces of the cloth”. In order to obtain a discoloration of the linen (by heat) a surface temperature of 150 200+°C. Is necessary. What is the result on the skin? Everybody knows the answer: destruction. It is impossible to remove a victim, “condemned to burning at the stake before substantial incineration”. High temperatures of the skin implies incineration. Therefore, it is a joke. CB seems to abandon his hot template model. Why ? Firstly, all this talk of trolling is just plain silly. When has it been trolling to express one’s views candidly about the TS on a site called: “Shroud of Turin Blog: latest news and views”? What’s more I was expressing my doubts as to the 1532 fire way back in February 2012 on my own site (in a comments section): http://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/the turin shroud man is a scorchograph and i challenge anyone to prove otherwise/ I introduced them with the words: “Health warning: what follows is strong stuff – not suitable for those of a nervous disposition.” Re Thibault’s comment: I was not suggesting that a scorch imprint could really be obtained from a hot body – merely that an artist (artisan?) had used that as the basis for a thought experiment, rendered pictorially. Perhaps I should have said “tongue in cheek” thought experiment, but didn’t think that would be necessary. I’ll say some more another time about hot templates v Luigi Garlaschelli’s frottage technique. Suffice it to say they both involve scorching by contact – either directly from a hot template, or indirectly when a facsimile powder imprint from a human subject is heated in an oven – with localised scorching occurring under the powder imprint, the latter then flaking away to leave a faint scorch. (So it’s still a scorch model in essence). I mentioned here a couple of days ago the similarity between Luigi’s technique and the one described in my very first TS posting on “thermostencilling”. What interests me primarily is not so much the precise details of the technology as the kind of physics and chemistry that is operating, which I still consider to be 3 D imprinting via contact scorching (conduction/pyrolysis) of some kind or another, as distinct from radiation. We need to know those carbohydrate profiles from the TS image zones, and then relate them to the botany of the primary and secondary cell walls.

They and their variable resistant starch (RS) content (depending on how they are made – traditional or extrusion) were a subject that caught the eye of one John Emsley, a well known science writer in the UK. . Back in the 80s he wrote on article on my resistant starch discoveries for the Independent newspaper (now in dire financial straits) entitled “The Hidden Good in White Bread”. While is not searchable under the paper’s name, but hey presto I’ve just discovered that the article is now being used as an English comprehension exercise! See page 2 of the pdf: http://www.ss.sugiyama u.ac.jp/waku/Skimming Predicting.pdf It’s amazing what one can dig up from the past simply by pressing a few laptop keys. Science bit: Brace yourselves. I found a high level of RS in standard Kelloggs cornflakes (with a useful dietary fibre like action and possible anti cancer properties in the colon mediated via anaerobic fermentation to short chain fatty acid). But when I looked at cornflakes produced by more modern extrusion technology there was scarcely any there. Everyone in the place I worked had their own ideas as to the reason, with some getting quite annoyed that their pet hypotheses were not instantly recognized as the Truth, the Whole Truth etc (ring any bells?) but through patient experimentation (the mainstay of science) the answer turned out to be quite banal. To form RS you need first to gelatinise starch and then to let it quickly recrystallize to form short chain linear alpha glucan (“mini straight chain starch”).. The latter process needs plenty of water, which is provided for in the traditional cooking process, but not in the typical extruder that runs on a rather dry mixture. Yup, the humble cornflake (made traditionally) has useful amounts of dietary fibre as RS, but not allowed back then in labelling declarations. I had terrible probably career damaging battles with the civil servants (who funded most of our nutrition research!) and with certain analysts to get them to change their minds on that. It all got rather complicated, especially when the EU got involved, and began organizing inter laboratory collaborative trials to compare my RS methodology with that of the fibre purists.

Those rats. I still have a guilty conscience regarding the use of rats, even for that lifespan trial. All they had to do was eat the experimental diets with different levels of fibre, but it was a kind of cruelty, even though they were well looked after by skilled and gentle technicians. I wish there could have been an alternative, but the alleged protective effects of dietary fibre are long term, so it took a lifespan trial to show that fibre does indeed protect against colonic diverticulosis. It required 1800 rats and was hugely expensive, paid for by the Ministry and ultimately the taxpayer. Butit provided hard evidence that favoured the fibre hypothesis, at a time when the latter was seen as threat by the bakers and millers who also financed my place of work, so I’m battle hardened so to speak when it comes to operating in a political climate. All one can do is argue the science and play for time. The millers and bakers did finally see sense on fibre when they found they could make more selling by wholemeal bread at a premium rather than white bread, provided they were allowed to use their preferred “improving agent”. But since that was ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) instead of the now banned bromate, they got the green light from me , as the industry’s nutrition/food safety advisor, from MAFF, from pretty well everyone, so the story finally had a happy ending. I’m still trying to think what to say re Raymond Rogers and his ideas that won’t cause more offence than already inflicted. But here’s a bit of advice. Put his name as R.N.Rogers into Google Scholar, and regard it as a de mythologizing exercise. One has to maintain some perspective where science and scientists are concerned, and look for the hard evidence, ignoring the hype. I would urge “anonymous” to do that exercise before continuing to describe Rogers as an expert in this or that.

My own thinking is changing by the hour, as one tries to understand why a wet imprint should result in reasonable 3 D properties (demonstrated yesterday btw with a plastic toy). The thing one has to beware of are preconceptions, especially pro authenticity ones. Medieval forgery opens up a much wider range of options that would have been judged entirely by the artefact maker purely on the “look” of the end result. What was the intended look? I’ve made my position clear on that for well over a year: it was to create a Veronica like imprint on fabric in sweat and blood (marking on my part an abandonment of the contact scorch theory that was tied to an attempt to symbolize slow roasting of Geoffroi de Charny’s alleged uncle alongside Jacques de Molay in 1314). The artisans were not time lords, worrying about the final look of their work on 20th/21st century 3 D rendering programs. They were concerned about the instant impression created on the relic hungry pilgrim. That’s why the dual image head to head configuration, life size, real linen was chosen in order to yell “real body imprint, a bigger and better version of that Veronica in Rome”. So what techniques did they deploy to best achieve their ends that just happen, purely by accident, to give the 3 D result we see today? I have some fresh ideas to offer on that, which I’ll mull over for a while before returning here, possibly this morning but probably the evening (am heading off shortly to a family reunion so will be hors de combat for quite some time. Here’s a taster: imprint the face either from a bas relief as per Luigi Garlaschelli OR imprint in LUWU configuration (face down into linen) separately from the rest of the body (LOTTO) to get not only a pseudo bas relief effect, but gravity aided flow of imprinting medium to the extremities (nose etc) giving extra image intensity where it’s most needed to convey the impression of an IMPRINT, not a artist’s sketch. Separate imprinting of head and body could also explain some anomalies, like the head seeming slightly too small for body (LOTTO gives more lateral distortion than LUWU), as well as that prominent crease at the neck/chin etc etc. Manual touching up of image will also be flagged up (there’s time an opportunity to do that while the blood drips and trails are applied immediately after imprinting medium, followed by conjoint printing that places blood under body image)..","date":"2015-05-10","mins":"2:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/10/colin-berrys-method-and-3d-information/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Colin Berry’s Method and 3D Information"},{"id":"comment-199069","author":"colin_berry","post":"“Pro inauthenticity preconceptions are as bad as proauthenticity preconceptions.” One begs to differ. A preconception is simply one kind of assumption, possibly one that the owner is initially unaware of being an assumption. But assumptions, whether they are preconceptions or not, are the lifeblood of science. Without making assumptions, tacit or otherwise, there would be no hypothesizing or model building. Without model building there would be no new research directions, no new data, no opportunity for refining existing models, or as occasionally happens, going back to the drawing board, and maybe rooting out one’s own or others’ assumptions and indeed preconceptions. The scientific method may not lead immediately to the right answers, but it’s a sure fire way of gradually and systematically dumping wrong answers,based on faulty assumptions, or indeed preconceptions. Contrast that with the preconception that says the ‘enigmatic’ TS features like image superficiality, 3 D properties could never have been created as a result of forgery. Where does one go from there? Where are the testable hypotheses? Even the non supernatural ones like Rogers’ putrefaction amine/semi degraded starch assisted ones have defied experimental modelling due to the host of qualifying assumptions that collectively add up to a non testable preconception (“it all took place in a tomb”). As for the supernatural ones that invoke special kinds of radiation (self emitting, self collimating, super air attenuated etc etc) and then claiming that entirely man made lasers offer a ‘possible glimpse of mechanism’ – here you see the kind of preconceptions that have no place in science, least of all Government funded science laboratories.

I’ll make a start now, taking breaks to check on sources, and use the Edit facility to keep my answers within this one reply. First, re the “braided hair”. I think it is a matter of individual interpretation as to whether there is a representation of long braided hair in the dorsal view. Yes, I know Bucklin described it thus, but it’s always been a mystery how someone accustomed to viewing cadavers on mortuary slabs could be quite so categorical in what he saw, or thought he saw, on the faint Shroud image. A couple of key points: firstly, there is nothing to differentiate hair from body image in the frontal view. The so called hair shows no strands etc. Given that the Shroud image is not a painting, and that no one is absolutely certain how the image was formed, we have to be very careful to distinguish between a “representation” of hair and real hair. Secondly, I have looked at the head in dorsal view very carefully with Shroud Scope, and am far from convinced that the “braid” is even a representation of hair. Its colour under my optimised contrast/brightness settings is different from the rest of the head “hair”, being more grey, less yellowish brown. It looks more like the imprint of a spine (cervical region) than hair if you ask me. I have done a screen grab of my Scope picture, and can attach it to one of my Shroud Scope series if you wish and provide a link. I say that the evidence for a braid of hair seems somewhat impressionistic to say the least. Re you second point: suppose the Man in the Shroud was intended initially to serve as an ambiguous tribute to Jacques de Molay. He was after all a major personage – last of the Templar Grand Masters – figurehead of an immensely wealthy chivalrous order at least until stripped of its wealth by Philp IV of France, aided and abetted by the Church’s charges of heresy. What kind of tribute is possible when the individual in question has been slow roasted to death and then reduced to ashes? I think there is a clear rationale for producing a scorched on image of de Molay on a burial shroud, serving a a metaphor for his death by slow barbecue, and perhaps deliberately incorporating hints of a Christ like fate at the hands of tormentors, false witnesses etc. It may have been that same ambiguity that allowed the original Shroud to morph into that of Christ’s burial Shroud, with the LATER addition of blood in strategic locations to convey the idea of a death by crucifixion. I say the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge captured the Shroud in a period of transition – from medieval Templar to New Testament faithful holy relic…. Re Templar ceremonies in the late 1200s, I have a complete open mind as to the existence of Shroud forerunners, proto Shrouds if you like. I have read of Barbara Frale’s discoveries in the Vatican secret archives, e.g. Http://templars.wordpress.com/2009/04/15/knights templar hid the shroud of turin says vatican/ and I have seen the Vatican’s questionable endorsement of her idea that the Templars venerated an allegedly like Shroud like image. But Frale forfeited her credibility in my humble opinion with that ridiculous “complete burial certificate” of “Jesus of Nazareth” written on the very fabric of the Shroud – but too faint for anyone else to discern. But let’s not throw baby out with the bathwater: the Shroud we see today may indeed be the product of a gradual evolution of the Shroud as a Holy Relic, one endowed with magical properties – the occupant de materialising to leave just a scorch – introducing yet another layer of ambiguity re the scorch. Was it made by a living OR dead person… if living, a craftsman fashioning a grim memento, but if dead, a victim of execution who was miraculously resurrected… “Thoughts on your theories versus the existence of Greek epitaphios circa 1200 / 1300 AD with Jesus laid on a herringbone weave cloth, with body wide wounds generally consistent with those on the shroud?” First, let’s be clear about one thing. There are no images of wounds on the Shroud body image. There are plenty of (so called?) scientists who will tell you there are wounds, and even ring them in red to show their supposed location, but I repeat, there are NO wounds, or should one say ‘unequivocal’ wounds. What are described as wounds are bloodstains. So we have all the hullabaloo about the wrist “wound” when in fact it is just a bloodstain on the wrist. Do any of your precursor Shrouds show a wrist wound? Or do they show a reversed 3 on the forehead? I doubt it. “Being consistent” is simply not good enough as definitive tests go – there should be replication of those crucial hallmark features. Anything else is just wishful thinking… As for the herringbone weave, I would imagine that medieval artists seized upon it with glee, even if as I suspect it was of medieval invention and thus anachronistic in portrayals of the Biblical tomb scene. Why? Because it allowed artists to clearly differentiate for the viewer’s benefit the linen of the Shroud from other plain or patterned surfaces. In short, the herringbone weave became an artistic device or convention to flag up that there was a very important burial Shroud in the picture – but whether it was Christ’s or of someone else has to be a matter of conjecture, especially as regards the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge with it highly ornate representation of the herringbone weave. “Was not the Lirey public display done in the context of the shroud being the Shroud of Jesus?” Maybe, maybe not. It could have been made deliberately ambiguous, along the lines of “Some say it’s a Templar knight who was crucified or barbecued or both (both in the case of Jacques de Molay), but some believe it to be the actual burial Shroud of Christ that was in the possession of the Templars and used to make a point. One thing’s for certain – the creator of Lirey Pilgrim’s badge did not go out of his way to convey an image of the crucified Christ, or even of the present Turin Shroud for that matter – no reversed 3, no visible wounds or blood on hand or feet, no scourge marks, no crown of thorns. Instead there is the peculiar chain like feature across the waist, looking for all the world like the chain used to secure victims at the stake for burning. Yes, I know that Ian Wilson interprets it as blood from the spear wound, but why would it gush laterally in spirals from BOTH sides of the torso.

If you mentally subtract the bloodstains one sees on the present Shroud (there being no obvious blood on the Lirey man), then there is nothing to suggest it was that of a crucified man, and indeed I have previously developed others’ suggestions that it was a Knight Templar (Jacques de Molay? Geofffroi de Charney?), and a scorched on image was initially intended as a tribute to Templar martyrs who were finally burned, or rather slow roasted, at the stake. De Molay was in fact crucified too as part of the long torture he endured for some 7 years, but survived, no doubt to be allowed to recover and face more torture. So that’s why there is no loin cloth. In fact it’s said that the final roasting was done in as sadistic a manner as possible, so the naked figure on the Lirey badge may well be portrayed as attempting to protect his genitals. I suspect that the Lirey Shroud gradually morphed into the present one through additions, notably of bloodstains in all the biblically relevant places. Remember there are no wounds on the basal body image – contrary to great deal of misinformation from some who should know better. Scourge marks are also simply bloodstains – with dumb bell shaped markings etc – but no real evidence for broken skin. The 1532 fire may have provided cover for some major tinkering – thus the scepticism that resulted in an enquiry by 3 bishops and 10 noblemen no less to rule on whether the post fire Shroud was the original. I don’t intend to do any more modelling myself, being content to test feasibility in principle. Have you seen my latest post, in which I propose that the template for the original body image may have been a death mask, with similar castings for the limbs and torso. It’s those who push the fluorescence argument (or rather lack of fluorescence) as evidence in favour of authenticity who need to do their homework. All they have to do is to produce a range of scorches at progressively higher temperatures. I predict that the low temperature scorches, comparable to the Shroud in terms of superficiality, will be non fluorescent, whilst high temperature scorches, comparable to those produced in the 1532 fire, will fluoresce on account of benzenoid aromatic ring systems. I’ll have to leave it there, since I’m away from home, but hope this somewhat terse reply to your points will do for now..","date":"2012-08-30","mins":"2:22 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/dan-porter-and-his-2002-long-bet10-years-on-was-he-right-i-say-no-time-has-proved-him-spectacularly-wrong/","cat":"criteria","title":"Dan Porter and his 2002 Long Bet,10 years on.

They proposed chemical imaging of a still living de Molay. I propose imaging off a metal effigy, possibly a crucifix to add to the confusion between Jesus Christ and an executed Templar It was strengthened by the close similarity between the names of Geoffroi de Charny, first known owner of the TS in Lirey, and Geoffroi de Charney, Preceptor of Normandy, who died at the stake the same day in 1314 as Jacques de Molay.

I shall be focusing (literally!) on the nodes, given the possibility that they may carry a distinctive signature for scorch damage, more so than the internodal region. Nodes may be where “most of the action” is, perhaps because they are the sites of cell cell junctions, with less in the way of crystalline, fracture resistant cellulose, and maybe more cementing hemicelluloses, pectins(?) and – most of all the enigmatic lignin – all of which are more thermally sensitive and prone to damage. We are told the Shroud image is incredibly superficial, but that does not (in my view) mean that the energy that produced it is highly superficial in its effects everywhere on something that is not simply a continuous uninterrupted filament.

That would surely be too cramped. I’m more inclined now to think in terms of a rotating open spit, with the linen wrapped in cylindrical or spiral fashion around a horizontal timber or metal pole,with turning handle, supported above a long tray of glowing embers (charcoal). That might explain the curious black specks one sees in the Mark Evans photomicrographs that I commented on back on late 2014: https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/31/those dark specks in the mark evans photographs/ At that time I thought the specks might be toasted flour particles, but I’ve gone off that idea – there being too few. Flecks of carbon (soot) from a charcoal fire seems more likely, sticking preferentially but not exclusively to the image imprinted areas for a variety of reasons. It was actually hot cooking oil I checked out as an alternative means of heating using my thermostatted deep oil fryer (which irritatingly stops heating at approx 190 degrees C).. Yes, the folded and rolled up linen was deep fried as if battered cod! I’ve abandoned it at least temporarily, but there was useful scientific spin off as indicated earlier. The ability to get a good primary image (Maillard) but failure to see a decent ghost image after abrasive washing to remove oil and crud can be seen as supporting my ‘blotting paper’ theory for the superficial TS image. The latter depends on limited penetration of tiny amounts of hot reactant efflux from browning flour into and between the fibres (condensing chemically on the surface of the fibres to form a thin yellow film of adsorbed Maillard products). If the spaces between linen fibres are already blocked with cooking oil, then there can be no blotting paper effect via capillary action!

So, when Google and the others trawl the web for new content, checking for new blog updates, they should display the blog title, FOLLOWED BY THE TITLE OF THE NEW POSTING.. But Google doesn’t.

So if one’s blog displays its credo, as this site does, then the introductory words only of the credo are displayed, and the NEW BLOG TITLE IS TOTALLY IGNORED!

That might explain the surprise expressed by the Poor Clare nuns at the brightness of the bloodstains if they had been called in to do the repair patches after the remedial work. It might also explain the doubts expressed re the genuineness of the Shroud in the immediate aftermath of the fire, explaining why it was felt necessary to convene a commission of enquiry to rule on the matter. What’s especially annoying for this investigator is that without the fire, one could have proposed a highly discriminating diagnostic test for the thermal flour imprinting model – i.e. Find some means for testing whether the ENTIRE linen has been exposed to high temperatures in the region of 200 degrees C. That is sadly ruled out. How does one test a model, the key feature of which is that the sensitizing agent to heat – in this instance white flour has been been washed out, and is no longer there, not even traces thereof (?).

Or, rather, their modelling thereof in the somewhat restrictive context of the flour imprinting model (requiring as it does that oven heating stage that would degrade blood to a most unblood like dark brown colour). There’s no shortage of evidence for there being collagen (connective tissue protein) in the Shroud bloodstains that really ought not to be there. See my posting done a long time ago, gently taking the late Raymond Rogers to task for thinking that his hydroxyproline result was diagnostic for the presence of blood, more specifically unheated blood: https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/i think i now know why sturp chemist raymond rogers thought there was hydroxyproline in the blood on the shroud and its to do with those medicinal leeches/ Following some clues from contrast adjustment in my photoediting program that suggests the presence of a faint yellow component that spreads out from underneath the TS bloodstains into the surrounding linen, which I had initially thought might be serum proteins, I got to wondering if I might be seeing evidence for that unphysiological out of area collagen instead. Experiment: make a viscous solution of gelatin in warm water, use before it sets to a gel as if “artificial blood” (though yellow, not red). Apply to my hand AFTER coating with oil and flour. Bake the linen as per usual (approx. 200 C) when the gelatin becomes visible as light brown stains. Then, and only then, apply red dye (commercial beetroot juice) by dabbing onto the gelatin stains. The result was most gratifying, the dye tending to stay put on the gelatin stain instead of spreading out into the surrounding linen which would have looked most unblood like. If the bloodstains had been ‘manufactured’ this way by a medieval ‘modeller’ would the result be compatible centuries later with STURP’s blood before image sequence of imprinting? Answer? It depends. It depends on whether the roasted gelatin, i.e. Collagen, still behaves like a typical protein. Had that been the case the yellow brown gelatin/collagen stain (plus attached red dye) would presumbly have been digested by the Adler/Heller protease, on the assumption that their source of enzyme had broad specificity towards a range of proteins (collagen as well as blood albumins etc) and that heat denaturation did not alter the susceptibility towards the protein digesting enzyme.

Previously I had suggested two more postings, one listing the 10 polemical obstacles that we Shroud iconoclasts are expected to negotiate, the other “selling” the flour imprinting model more forcibly than has been the case so far. Yesterday I went back to the shroudstory site (which ‘closed up shop’ in December last year) looking to remind myself about the model’s initial reception on that site. (Much is best left to moulder there, given the level of vituperation on display, though in most cases from ‘newbies’ popping out of the woodwork to deliver their tirade laced with personal insults). However there was one comment from the wise and perceptive David Goulet (author of ‘Looney Tombs’ that lifts the, er lid, on the reclusive world of funeral directors). Here it is in full: David Goulet September 3, 2015 at 9:26 am What would be interesting is to find a scientist, or two, who is not a Shroudie and present him Colin’s linen/shroud and see how long it takes him/her to discern how the image was formed. This would provide a baseline of sorts. If the scientist quickly deduces that flour/oil and heating was used then we would have to ask ‘how is it the mechanism was more easily observed on Colin’s shroud vs the actual one?” If Colin’s model is ‘the answer’ what tell tale signs would we have to find on the Shroud to corroborate his theory? Or is my presumption wrong here and Colin is not saying this model is exactly how the Shroud image was created, but rather his model merely demonstrates that a simple mechanism can account for certain Shroud properties, which had previously been attributed only to complex mechanisms (lasers, etc). Just trying to wrap my head around the various repercussions of the theory. Link to Dan Porter’s posting: https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/03/colin berrys latest and greatest is it enough/ Sorry I never responded at the time, David, being, to put it crudely, up to my arse in alligators. But I shall respond soon. Not here, but on a new posting that will take the form of ‘Questions and Answers on the Flour Imprinting Model’. Your discerning question has really put me on the spot, but more importantly, probably puts both analytical chemistry and the scientific method on the spot too. Would modern day science have a ready and correct explanation for my final faint attenuated imprint, the one that remains – see site banner after vigorous washing with soap and water, with no encrusted material, no particulate matter visible under the microscope (and thus no scope for a latter day Walter Mc Crone), merely a faint seemingly superficial yellow brown discoloration? Would it require more than science? Would it require an imaginative leap, preceded by putting oneself in the place of a medieval artisan, wondering how he might set about simulating (less politely, “faking”) an ancient sweat imprint on linen. Yes, on reflection, that’s the way to go. I’ll address David’s question first, which should be sobering if nothing else, then invite new ones. Meanwhile, I shall continue to trawl the Porter archives for further questions re the TS to which I was not able or willing, for one reason or another, to do proper justice at the time.

I look forward to reading when I have a spare hour or two – it being mercifully shorter than its 200+ page predecessor that overwhelmed me last year – needing one to set aside days… However, there’s a caveat. Anyone who focuses on the colour of the blood, investing the time that Adrie has put into analysing spectral characteristics etc has to be exceedingly careful if coming from a pro authenticity point of view. Why? Because even if the TS were 1st century, and the original bloodstains genuine, who’s to say that most if not all that original blood has not flaked off and been subsequently ‘touched up’? And if touched up, what was used? More original blood, or fake look alike blood? The question I would put to Adrie is this: what does she make of Rogers finding a peak for hydroxyproline in his mass spectometer. Is that not a marker for collagen? Isn’t collagen a marker for connective tissue, not blood? And isn’t collagen, in the form of gelatin (either as a solid gel or viscous liquid) precisely the kind of substance that might be in the medieval tool kit? I can show her photographs taken after dribbling mixtures of red dye and viscous gelatin solution onto linen. The gelatin runs in rivulets a short distance, with no obvious soaking into linen, with plumped up blood like beads, sharp meniscus etc, which then set solid, freezing the ‘right look’. One can then overpaint, either with real or fake blood, and straightaway one has an answer to the blood before image conundrum in the flour imprinting model (details another time). I had said last year I wasn’t planning to research blood, feeling it was a separate issue from body image, assuming there was a means of imprinting so as to look as if blood had arrived first (as indeed there is, indeed more than one). But since discovering the versatility and potential of gelatin as a component of ‘fake blood’, not only for touching up, but for simulating the original blood in an initially unpromising blood degrading thermal imprinting model, I may do a separate posting on it, maybe using your question as the posting’s title. It’ll also be an opportunity to respond to Adrie in greater detail. For now the focus has to stay on that ‘washed out’ looking body image (see today’s addition to the present posting). Why does it look ‘washed out’? Answer: because most of the Stage 1 imprint WAS indeed washed out.

Well, maybe they did or didn’t. But if there is indeed madder under the blood, and only the blood (?) then there’s a ready explanation in terms of the new model I’m currently developing for the bloodstains (see current posting, with “cunning” and “dastardly” in the title! I now believe that the ‘forgers’ of a 14th century TS decided roughly where the bloodstains needed to go for biblical credibility, and protected that part of the linen from imprinting agent. For example, they could have coated the subject with oil, then added patches of linen – circular, oval, sausage shape etc – as flagged up earlier on this thread BEFORE sprinkling with flour, then proceeded to shake off surplus flour, and then the linen patches. After the linen had been roasted then washed, there would be handy blank areas in the body image on which they proceeded to paint or dribble blood. If the paint did not cover the blank areas 100% that would have left white edges or patches with no body image colour currently (mis?)interpreted as serum haloes etc.and indeed one sees evidence for paler than body image areas in and around bloodstains. But maybe our forgers did not want those paler areas to look too much like virgin linen. So what did they do?

The pre prepared stock of masks can then be quickly applied to all the strategic locations on their chosen flour coated subject (or subjects in the plural, if, as suggested earlier there were TWO used in the imprinting session, one for the frontal, the other, of roughly the same height and build, for the dorsal image). Careful painting/infilling of the blank, mask protected regions of the imprinted linen with blood or “blood” could also have been done at leisure after the crucial oven heating stage. Indeed, it could have been done more than once, say every 50 100 years, so as to maintain a pristine appearance, given that blood, real blood that is, would have a tendency to flake off with time, especially as a result of handling the Shroud (displaying, folding, refolding etc).

Because model contact scorches do NOT fluoresce under uv, at least not my uv source, one that detects fluorescent pigments in bank notes, marker pens, tonic water etc etc. The mantra that scorches do not fluoresce under uv seems to be based on a single observation, and a highly questionable one at that, namely the margins of the 1532 burn holes on the TS, that are said to fluoresce red under uv. A full thickness burn hole, with total carbonization indicative of exposure to very high temperatures, can hardly be described as a typical “scorch” even if there’s an intermediate zone between black carbon and unaltered linen that looks golden brown and vaguely scorch like.

Ideally, it should be in the public domain, especially that obtained by STURP, given the manner in which STURP conclusions have been thrust into the public domain. STURP did not produce its own final report, bar the short summary. STURP findings are scattered through a plethora of research papers, conference proceedings and personal memoirs, much of it behind paywalls, and in many instances lacking abstracts that make it impossible to know whether each $30 $40 order placed with a publishing house would provide the desired information. Of especial interest in the Adler/Heller “blood first, image second” mantra, based on experiments we’re told with protease enzymes. How exactly were those experiments performed? Is there any photographic record of what was seen undeer the microscope. Without answers to those questions it’s impossible to know whrher the “evidence of the blood” is all it’s cracked up to be.

I can only speak for a particular digital re processing program, freely downloadable on the web, i.e. Image J. I have reported in a dozen or more postings that there is nothing unique in principle about the TS image. 3 D properties are shown by any graphic that has gradations, abrupt steps even, in image intensity. The reason is simple: the software reads image density as height above the xy plane, constructing an imaginary z (vertical) axis for display purposes. The 3 D impression is further enhanced by the software installing a virtual low level light source to one side (the left) which then creates virtual shadows. The so called 3 D properties of the TS image can be seen as an entirely predictable manifestation of its imprinted origin, one where’s there’s no directional light source, as in conventional photography. The absence of shadows makes it ‘easier’ for the software to render in 3 D strictly according to image density, which in turn depends partly (but only partly) on the 3 D nature of subject being imprinted (flour tending to settle on the higher FLATTER contours, and scarcely if at all on the vertical planes, notably sides of the subject). Beware those who resort to digital oneupmanship (“you’ve used too much smoothing”, “you should have converted natural colour to black and white”, “you should have used Image J’s Thermal LUT mode” etc etc. All these and other factors have been patiently investigated and found, without exception, to be red herrings, an attempt to make this user of Image J seem like a rank amateur compared to their total professionalism. There’s a sense in which we’re all amateurs where sindonology and the alleged “unique 3 D properties” are concerned.

Based on what prior assumptions, dare one say self serving preconceptions, like a sheet of linen loosely draped over a recumbent subject, as per authenticity models (rock tomb etc). But the medieval modelling of the ;’transport linen’ with a pseudo sweat imprint is not bound by those considerations.

It doesn’t stop there. The flour imprinting model gives the artisan TOTAL CONTROL over which part to imprint or not imprint, simply by deciding which parts of the subject’s anatomy to coat with flour, which parts to leave uncoated.

One has only to look at botanical cross sections of flax/linen fibres to see that Mother Nature provides an outermost cell layer that is 200nm or less thick, i.e. The primary cell wall. Any mechanism, real or imagined, that selectively coloured the PCW – possible in principle, given the chemical differences between PCW and SCW )would automatically generate an “image” layer that was 200nm or less thick (which is not to say that the TS image is confined to the PCW). As for the laser approach, words fail me. Are we being asked to assume that the depth of coloration produced by uv radiation, whether laser generated or not, can never be greater than the wavelength of the radiation, e.g. That uv of wavelength, say, of 200nm can never produce effects at depths greater than 200nm, that the laser is guarantted to produce superficial effects only?

By that I mean the resort to comments that my approach is an irrelevance and waste of everyone’s time, on account of so and so (the latter invariably unrelated to experimental model building, which is this researcher’s speciality). Off the top off my head, there are some 10 standby ‘so and so’ interventions that I’ve come to expect. Here they are, listed with a bare minimum of detail: 1.The deployment of the term “burial” shroud. There’s no evidence that the TS, whether authentic or of medieval manufacture, represents a “burial” shroud. It’s the uncritical use of that term “burial shroud” that introduces irrelevancies (putrefaction products, as in the Rogers’ model, miraculous flashes of radiation etc etc ). The biblical description of the linen in the three synoptic gospels suggests it was intended and used merely as an impromptu means of transporting the crucified body from cross to tomb, where the account in John then takes over (winding strips etc). The TS was a transport shroud for an unwashed body (thus the idea of a ‘sweat imprint’ of the body accompanied by bloodstains). 2. Re the claimed references in art of writing to the TS prior to the Lirey display in 1355 or thereabouts, consistent with the radiocarbon dating. There are no reports that this researcher is aware of for the existence of the iconic ‘two fold’, head to head, frontal v dorsal image that one sees on the Lirey badge.There may have been any number of images of a face – or whole frontal image even prior to Lirey, but it is misleading to say the least to claim they were representations of THE Shroud, and thence to claim that the radiocarbon daters got it wrong or have ignored ‘compelling’ historical evidence. 3. Likewise the evidence for the TS being older than the radiocarbon date is rendered invalid if based on claims that the fibres are chemically or mechanically older (i.e. Weaker) than 600 700 years. If the TS image was produced by thermal technology as per my model, then the heating step would produce changes that are comparable to those resulting from age, except they would produce in minutes what would normally take centuries at ordinary environmental temperatures, given the nature of chemical kinetics (a mere 10 degree rise in temperature generally doubling the rate of most chemical reactions). I typically use 200 degrees C to develop the flour imprints, which is approx 18 consecutive doublings of rate (2,4,8,16 etc).

Next posting? Here or elsewhere? I had decided to make my pitch more strongly, namely that the TS is a flour imprint, made to seem like (and later promoted as) a 1300 year old sweat imprint left on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen. Note that word “pitch”, a colloquial alternative to message, thesis etc. But then I recalled the expression “queering the pitch”, and realized why I have felt discouraged from “making my pitch” more strongly these last 12 or so months. That’s due to the inevitable attempts by defenders of authenticity to “queer my pitch” by bringing in a range of standard “rebuttals” that attempt to undermine any notion of medieval manufacture. Here’s how one internet source describes the meaning of “queer the pitch”: (Originally) interfere with or spoil the business of a tradesman or showman. (More recently) spoil the business at hand. Origin ‘Queer’ has been used as a verb meaning ‘to spoil’ since the early 19th century. Putting those two together we get the meaning of this little phrase. It was first recorded, in the vernacular speech of 19th century London, in The Swell’s Night Guide, 1846: (I’ll spare readers the details). Further on we read: Travelling showmen and market hawkers also called the place they set out their stalls a ‘pitch’. ‘Queer the pitch’ was frequently used it those circles, and later amongst travelling theatre groups, as meaning ‘distract the paying audience from the show’. Directing the public away from one trader’s business and towards one’s own was an important part of street trading of any sort. There was and still is an established pecking order of positions where a stallholder may ‘pitch up’ on any site. It is a difficult to explain but none the less established fact that a crowd, when entering an open space through an entrance, will veer to the right. The stallholders whose stalls languish on the left hand side were likely to try any sort of ‘queering’ of the right hand ground to redirect traffic. So don’t be surprised if I produce a posting here, or maybe on my sciencebuzz site, with the title “Unqueering the pitch on the Shroud of Turin”. Then, and only then, I’ll proceed to blow my ‘flour imprinting’ trumpet, spelling out the technology that I previously considered might have been used, but am now firmly of the opinion WAS used to produce the TS body image. One possibility that has just this minute come to mind is to post the “Unqueering the pitch” preliminary here, then following up in short order with a detailed appraisal and indeed promotion of my (not so) new technology on sciencebuzz.

Being treated not just as an outsider, but as a ‘non person’, indeed pariah one suspects, judging by some of the stray remarks one encounters from time to time, is something else entirely.

The image fibrils showed no signs of capillarity. If your images were analyzed, would they also show this? No, they do not show signs of capillarity, but I have to add an important proviso. There are no signs of clogging of the relatively large interstitial pores of the weave, ones that can be seen by holding the fabric up to the light. What may be present is coloration that migrates between the closely apposed fibres of the weave – where the gaps are so small that capillarity really comes into its own. But STURP did not examine that aspect of between fibre migration when addressing the question of artists’ pigments. One would not expect paint medium to penetrate BETWEEN fibres within a thread – only between threads. 2. The darkened color was only present on the very crowns of the fibrils. Under a microscope, would we see the same thing on your samples? Yes, I do. See the link above, then scroll down to the end (“Topic 1”). The concentration of colour on the crowns of the weave is precisely what one might expect from inprinting with a powdered solid (white flour) as distinct from a solution or liquid suspension. 3. Heller also reported that there was no variation in the color of the image fibrils–areas where the color seemed to be more intense on the linen was due to a greater number of fibrils in a given area being colored–almost like the digital images on an old black and white Macintosh computer. Yes, I see the so called half tone effect, where image fibres all have the same degree of coloration, differing only in the number. What’s more, my model can explain that. The colour is due to a migration of a liquid along the fibres, leaving even coloration as it goes. I initially thought the migrating liquid was due to the natural oils within flour which on heating “fried” the fibre carbohydrates as they spread. I’m now more inclined to think that the conjectured mobile migrating liquid represents high temperature Maillard reaction products (liquid) which polymerise in transit to yellow or brown substances, staining the linen fibres, probably on their external surfaces, at least initially. So we have an explanation for the ‘fuzziness’ of the TS image – liquid migration from hotspots, only getting so far along each fibre, then abruptly stopping, producing a ragged edge due to different distances of migration between adjacent fibres..","date":"2016-07-22","mins":"4:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: “Shroud of Turin – and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic) science”"},{"id":"comment-7497","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks Matthew.

I too believe there’s a connection between the Shroud and the biblical account of the road to Calvary, but not for the pro authenticity reason you cite, i.e. Imprinting with real mineral dust from the road. I believe that medieval artisans, probably the clerics employed by Geoffoi de Charny for his private monarch financed chapel at Lirey, hit on the idea of modelling an icon along the lines of the fabled Veil of Veronica (the imprint of Christ’s face which, according to legend, was captured en route to the cross) but with a difference, It would be the imprint of the entire body, both sides, captured shortly after death in sweat and blood en route from the cross to tomb, wrapped in Joseph of Arimathea’s ‘fine linen’ (NOT intended one might add as the final burial shroud). Flour, or something similar, was used as the imprinting medium, but only because it achieved that ‘authentic looking’ sweat imprint appearance AFTER oven roasting and thorough laundering, leaving the faint yellow image but no trace of the inspired choice of imprinting medium.

One of the practical snags where imprinting off real people is concerned is how one ensures that the frontal image aligns exactly with dorsal image on the long axis. That’s easier said than done if imprinting off a single person, whether doing both sides simultaneously or sequentially. Solution: don’t use one person – use two of roughly the same height and build. Get them to lie head to head on a sheet of sacking or similar with the required gap between the heads, one face down, the other face up, and then get them to adjust their positions as instructed till in perfect alignment. One can then sprinkle white flour (imprinting medium) from a sieve onto their upper surfaces, then pull out and dispose of the sacking with surplus flour from the edges, then cover the elevated contours of both subjects with wet linen and imprint manually. I have modelled the above using my brass crucifix to represent one subject (frontal) and plastic toy (see banner) the other (dorsal), both fortuitously having roughly the same size. The resemblance of the final heat processed image with the Lirey badge and TS is striking. As previously stated, one can also see how the ‘baked in’ creases of the TS result from rolling up the imprinted linen with blank spacer linen to get a compact package for heat processing and resulting Maillard colour development (final golden brown image). In fact the ‘twin track’ ‘crease’ is reproduced almost exactly (two brown bands of unequal width separated by a pale central zone, as described many moons ago in an earlier posting that argued the case, correctly I now consider, for those ‘baked in creases’).

I’ve been exploring novel strategies for reducing reverse side coloration. The one that has yielded unexpected dividends these last few days came through investigating a different question – like how to obtain a good imprint when heating a rolled or folded up length of linen – compactness being an advantage in any heating system that involves a 4.4m length of linen. Simple rolling up was not an option, since it put the flour imprint in direct contact with the reverse side. So an EXTRA sheet of ‘blank’ linen was placed over the imprint before rolling up. Hey presto, reverse side coloration disappeared almost entirely. But there were intriguing new effects seen, like (1) “baked in” creases due to kinking of the primary linen on rolling up, like (2) image fibre breaking and “tufting’ due to adhesion as a consequence of the two sheets of linen becoming stuck together by the ‘cooked’ imprint during heating, and needing to be pulled gently apart. It remains to be seen whether these new observations, chiming with comparable oddities re the real Shroud (creasing, tufting) are relevant or not.

Yet that’s an awful lot of extra work in making the mould, having to scoop out the soft stone and smooth the hollows of sunken relief (recalling that final raised relief has to be generated ‘in reverse’ so to speak). But what if the Mark 1 Shroud image, the one that Bishop Henri de Poitiers heartily approved initially, WAS a striking and indeed enigmatic bas relief, obtained accidentally by use of a particular means of thermal processing, still used to this day I might add, and which spawned the Lirey badge to advertise that novel and unexpected outcome? Later, when the image deteriorated (flaked off etc) the make or break decision was made to wash and gently abrade with more soap, when it was then discovered there was a permanent ghostly image still there, one that was deemed ‘authentic’ looking. Thus we have the Mark 2 Shroud, for which we also have the Machy mould with the added word SUAIRE (“shroud”) beneath a Jesus like face (Veronica reminiscent), and it was the re display of that icon morphed into ‘genuine’ relic that caused the Bishop to erupt in fury, perhaps suspecting it had all been pre planned and that he was the fall guy.

It’s never been my ambition to do a life size model Matthieu. What attracted me in the first instance was the claim that the image characteristics (superficiality, 3 D properties, microscopic features etc) were ‘enigmatic’ and/or beyond the ability of any known man made technology. What seems clear right now is the remarkable similarity between the technology now being proposed and “invisible ink” for writing secret messages using milk or lemon juice to write an invisible message that can then be developed by holding the paper over a light bulb or candle. In both instances it’s probably Maillard reactions that produce most or all of the brown colour. For invisible writing with invisible ink, substitute invisible imprinting with near invisible solid white flour or similar as imprinting medium, but again using heat to develop the colour. The difference is that linen,unlike paper, can then be given a thorough wash, removing all the imprinting medium, leaving no clues as to how the final faint image had been formed. That’s one more reason surely to stop with small scale models where it’s image characteristics rather than large scale morphology (with all the attendant guesswork) that is modelled.

Yes, I agree completely re your reasoning for the toasted v yellow colour. This is why I think the reversed geometry is so important. It reduces toasting by conduction and increases generalised cooking and diffuse yellowing by forced convection. In fact, when linen is laid over a hot template there may be very little conduction, because the first formed steam (linen is said to be approx 8% free water) will create a steam cushion that prevents atom to atom contact, so most of the heat transfer is then by the action of superheated steam and later by additional pyrolysis gases.

Your major objection, or at any rate reservations re forgery, will have to wait for a day or two. Dealing with your last point: no, white flour is not necessarily the only imprinting medium that works, or might work. Similar results might (or might not) be obtained from other milled grains, or maybe milled seeds or nuts, especially oily ones. The important property is that they should all of them ‘sweat’ a yellow or brown tinted fluid when heated at temperatures up to around 200 C (which linen amazingly tolerates). In a forgery model, such as the one I propose, one may never know for certain what was used as imprinting agent, given that all traces of it could/would have been removed in the final laundering that is needed to obtain the final attenuated image (essentially a weak ‘blot’ mark left by a heat induced oily exudate). To summarize: whatever the imprinting medium, heat from an oven or open charcoal fire made it ‘sweat’ and permanently mark linen so as to model the notional ‘look’ of a human sweat imprint. There’s a neat symmetry there, no? Afterthought: When using white wheaten flour as the imprinting medium, I used a thin smear of oil on the skin first to assist adhesion and to ensure an even powder distribution when the surplus was shaken off. It’s just possible that if a milled oil containing seed or nut was used, then there would be less need for the preliminary smear of oil – the powder could/would stick to skin using its own oil!

That’s not altogether unwelcome of course, boredom being the main enemy in this retired science bod’s life at present, but one does have to consider one’s options very carefully to avoid being diverted off one’s chosen course. What you propose could be quite interesting, although I have to say I think you are kidding yourself if you imagine there is some kind of equivalence between the position of those who see the Shroud as dating back to the 1st century AD and those like myself who see it as a clever indeed ingenious forgery from the medieval era. We can discuss the matter of C dating another day. Suffice it to say that if you seek to restore the kind of equivalence that existed in the 1970s (?) when I recall reading a fascinating account of then “modern” analysis of the Shroud in the Sunday Times Magazine (or colour supplement as we used to call it) , with the 3 D imaging, the “correct” nailing through the wrist etc.then you are going to have to get some more samples of fabric released for dating – with a clear a priori understanding as to what results will be accepted without quibble. Naturally I am flattered that you should approach me to be sceptic in chief. But my blog is just as new as yours, and I have my own blogging model that is distinctly different in approach. Mine is less confrontational. More thoughtful, dare I say more creative. You see, I accept the C dating. My interest is in knowing precisely how that image was produced, and how it came to fool 20th century science for as long as it did. There is a parable to be learned here, methinks, regarding the use and misuse of the scientific method and scientific data that has relevance to issues of more pressing and immediate concern to humanity, notably the greenhouse effect and climate change, AIDS aetiology etc etc. Let’s keep in touch. I shall certainly visit your site from time to time, and may comment if the spirit moves me. But I prefer to comment when I feel i have something worth saying, not in a purely reactive fashion to others, no matter how provocative the stimulus.

However, to avoid the distortions in the image the underlying statue would have to be a bas relief (as has already been tested before by numerous experimenters but might be worth a revisit). I also think it would have to be a low relief as well, because any bedding down movement might show as a blurring of markings. I think that rather than using a sand bed, instead a bed of dense but compressible wool, would help transfer the depth information into an increase in pressure of the linen against the hot surface (as I dont think the sand bed would be responsive enough to achieve a linear relationship between the depth and the pressure). The scorching on the top surfaces of fibres and the ability to scorch some fibres and not neighbouring fibres might all be down to pressure difference as Colin mentioned. I’m not sure whether that level of responsiveness in possible with a scorch image to give the subtlies in the Shroud, but some experimentation might give some indication of this. I disagree with Colin that just showing the principle is enough and the rest is arts and crafts – I spent many years working in transferring theoretical results into workable technologies with sufficient fidelity ….sometimes it’s not possible. But I agree with Colin that I wouldnt be too confident about the UV fluorescnce results if you are not comparing like with like pyrolysis results (ie image and 1500′s fire pyrolysis results as they were created under different circumstance). I’d like to see the proper report on this as it seems like an important result to establish. However I still think the bas relief method would struggle to explain the faint image on the other side of the head given that the fibres in between dont appear to affected. Also the blood patterns apparently being created before the image (how sure are we of this?) I’d like to see a comparison of the intricate blood and whip marks, to see if these correlate exactly as they are precise enough as markers – I saw somewhere some very faint images (only visible after image processing) of the leather parallel strip marks that lead towards the actual whip wounds – that was very impressive to me. There are a number of other physical results I’ve come across whilst researching in only the last month that I found to be perplexing if you work on the hypothesis that its a fake, and thats not to mention some of the historical documents.

Given the latter is behind a paywall, with copyright restrictions, I refrain from quoting his words verbatim. Suffice it to say that he has placed a seemingly new word into the Shroud literature, namely “trelle” or “treille” (medieval French), apparently “trellis” in modern English. The gist of his comment was that the 14th/15th century literature regarding the first reportings of the Shroud referred (oh so annoyingly!) to the image being on a “trellis”, with no mention of cloth. “Table” also substitutes for cloth. Those familiar with this site from its inception (2012) will know that “trellis” featured prominently in my Model 2 (“scorch hypothesis”) being the pattern displayed on the reverse side of the Lirey Pilgrims’ badge (not mentioned by Mario in his current article, though mentioned in a handy article on his site under the “Papers” tab – see link below, he reporting his visit to the Cluny Museum in Paris to view the badge in person.). I now have a new narrative that could possibly account for the “trellis” involvement. It’s to do with the 14th century modelling of the means by which Joseph of Arimathea’s “fine linen” was used to transport the crucified Jesus from cross to tomb. Maybe it wasn’t an unsupported sagging linen used to transport the body. Maybe the linen was envisaged as being first spread over a lightweight wooden trellis, used to provide sufficient but rigid support for an adult body. That’s why the trellis is shown on the REVERSE side of the Lirey badge. It added to the credibility, seen through the eyes of medieval pilgrims. It was linen plus trellis as stretcher, not just linen per se! (Late insertion: unfortunately it’s not a simple trellis shown on the rear of the badge, as I pointed out back in 2014, taking an image from Mario’s sindonology.org site and using MS Paint to give added emphasis to the faint trellis pattern:) https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/trellis with and without blue overlay.jpg?w=640&h=296 More to come, possibly a new posting after a break of well over 2 months!… Any new posting from this authenticity rejecting blogger, like its 350+ predecessors, will no doubt be ignored, needless to say, not only by authenticity fixated/promoting websites, but the Google so called search engine, at least by those entering simply entering “shroud of turin”… But one has to put one’s views on record, if only for the benefit of future historians… More and more, the internet looks like a medium for Californian driven mind manipulation, mind control.

Here’s a link to just one of the several summaries appearing in the popular press: https://www.news.com.au/technology/science/archaeology/shroud of turin conceals a bloody secret/news story/a5b1e20e8da9172e8f456935c6e702b4 Caveat: if you thought you’d seen these results before, you were right: they were presented at conferences in Seattle and Orlando in 2014/2015, as reported on Dan Porter’s blog at the time: https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/11/new garlaschelli and borrini study/ The gist is that the bloodstains on the Shroud are too random in their direction to have been realistically acquired from a crucified body onto a sheet of linen. In short, the bloodstains have been faked. Reminder of my own (hopefully) final Model 10. Two naked adult male subjects, approximately the same height and build, lay on the floor head to head, one face down, the other face up. White flour was sprinkled over the two separate surfaces, one frontal, the other dorsal, from a height. Maybe after an initial smear of oil to act as light adhesive. Surplus flour was fanned/blown or otherwise shaken off. A slurry of red clay or similar was then trickled onto the subjects to represent Mark 1 “blood”, for which the subject could have been moved at intervals, or even stood up to account for the Liverpool modelling data with blood going ‘in all directions’, somewhat fanciful (artistic licence etc). A sheet of wet linen was then pressed down onto the two subjects simultaneousy (after their returning to the recumbent position). The sheet of flour/clay imprinted linen was then gently roasted over glowing embers (or in a large breadmaking oven or similar) to develop the yellow body image (white flour to melanoidins – comparable to brown crust formation in breadbaking) but not in places that received the “blood”. Later, after removal from heat a more realistic substitute for “blood” was painted on top of the red clay areas (maybe using the last meal of human blood from medicinal leeches, better suited to serve as “paint” given its non clotting tendencies, as I proposed back in 2012 causing a degree of wonder and indignation). The two step procedure for Mark 1 and Mark 2 blood accounts for the “blood before image” finding from Adler and Heller, and more recent data that reported traces of red clay in a Shroud “bloodstain” (from microscopy experts Gérard Lucotte et al in Paris).

There’s not a single shred of evidence to back that up (hard evidence that is). The Turin so called “Shroud”, read faked taut linen transport stretcher, based on the biblical Joseph of Arimathea intervention, was a superb invention on the part of an obscure, tiny, secretive clique of relic fixated 14th century opportunists. Why not celebrate the TS for what it is? It was fabricated as a visual aid for simple trusting moneyed pilgrims – summarising key verses of the New Testament – namely those few in the four canonical Gospels that relate the aftermath of the crucifixion – deficient and indeed contradictory as regards essential detail. It was a stupendous work of genius – one that has hoodwinked generations of yearning for mystique true believers – latterly aided and abetted by the totally irrelevant intrusion of 19th century photography and 20th century 3 D rendering computer software). It’s time the “Shroud” of Turin fantasy was seen for what it is – wishful thinking – with lashings of pseudoscience – and finally laid to rest… Sindonology does a disservice to science (real science that is!).

I assume you meant to say ”real corroboration’ 😉 A single experiment describing loss/non loss of colour from fibres that have scarcely any colour to start with, as seen under the microscope when wetted with enzyme solution, hardly constitutes definitive evidence for the view that blood came before body image. It’s non quantitative evidence, and one is being asked to take too much on trust. A great deal hangs on the truth or otherwise of the blood first claim, yet it has been raised to the level of dogma, and dogma that is cited at every opportunity by those keen to reject any idea of forgery. Sorry, but I don’t think there is any place for dogma in science, and that applies not just to this particular claim of Adler’s, but to two others of his as well – the weird bilirubin conjecture – now elevated to dogma – and his equally weird clot retraction/serum exudation suggestion – also dogma.

Probably both, I would guess. In other words, there were two bas reliefs, one for the front, one for the back. Each was pressed vertically into the linen with some heat absorbent “padding” underneath (damp sand? snow? damp wool or bedding?) to achieve good contact between cloth and template thus ensuring a reasonably good imprint (but some tenting effect is inevitable, which one sees as white space around the crossed hands etc). But each template would presumably not penetrate more than a few centimetres into the underlay. That means no imaging of the sides of the effigy, which aren’t present on shallow bas relief templates anyway, and no ears, and no ‘top of head’. I suppose it’s possible that a single template was used for the head, if using an ‘in the round’ bust, say, as distinct from flatter bas relief ‘death masks’, but there would still be limited imaging of the sides, and if there were too much of the latter, one would see distortion effects that would be unsightly and a giveaway. Having said that, I noticed some distinct signs of excessive ‘wrap around’ effect with the lower legs when looking at Shroud Scope images the other day. It’s a different leg as I recall when checking both frontal and dorsal images, which makes one wonder if there was not some operator bias where pushing/imprinting was concerned, i.e. Pressure was not applied directly and evenly over the midline of the long axis. Put another way, the template tipped a bit to one side, probably towards the ‘pusher/rammer’.

I am theorising that the instant act of dematerialization created some biological process that created the image. I don’t know if we can ever create a model for that process, given (ordinarily) bodies do not instantly dematerialize. My reply: No Matthias, it’s everyone else who has the problem, at least those who assume it was a real corpse with the shroud doing a tight U turn at the top of the head, thus maintaining body linen contact. With thermal imprinting by this new method of mine (and previous one too for that matter) one can only efficiently imprint one side at a time. So it’s left to the operative(s) to decide on how much space to leave between the two images – frontal v dorsal.

Good of you to look by again. As I say, the term “expert” is almost meaningless when applied to an unsolved enigma, even for those of us who have few reservations about the medieval dating. It was Professor Luigi Gonella I believe who was largely responsible for abandoning the pre agreed sampling protocol at the eleventh hour AND for quietly sequestering a thread or two from that single corner sample that he subsequently gifted to Ray Rogers. What price then Rogers’ claim that the thread was an end to end splice of two initially separate ones, implying re weaving? Who’s to say that it was not Gonella who did the splicing – having pulled too hard on his forceps or whatever and snapped the thread?. As for Rogers’ bizarre report being described without hefty qualification as “peer reviewed”, I’ve no doubt you are not unaware of his choice of journal – Thermochimica Acta – one which he helped to set up and for which he served as Editor for many years. For my sins, I used to referee scientific papers. I would not have declined to referee a paper submitted by one of its own Editors – but would have sought reassurances that my involvement and report was totally anonymous. Did that happen with Rogers’ paper? Is anyone on the present Journal prepared to state categorically that was how it was handled? If not, then the review process was seriously flawed. Personally, I don’t think Rogers should have chosen his own journal anyway for so controversial a paper. And while he may have described himself as a thermochemist, that particular speciality was somewhat peripheral to a critique of the radiochemical dating, unless that white rabbit from hat called Vanillin was an attempt to substitute dodgy chemistry for good physics. I’ve chuntered away for too long and will now take a break. Keep an eye on this thread, however. I may have one or two other observations to make, not about Stephen Jones’s site, where I try not to linger any longer than absolutely necessary, but Ian Wilson (for what he wrote about the Lirey Pilgrim’s Badge).

I refer to the fact that testing for AB, at least serologically, is totally dependent on the presence of red blood cells, i.e. The forward test, since there are no antibodies for A or B in the plasma for reverse testing. So one may well ask how anyone managed to get a serological test for AB on Shroud “blood”, given it was said by Adler et al to have no visible red cells. As if that weren’t enough of an analytical roadblock, we were also told by Adler that it cannot even be described as haemolysed aged whole blood, but a pale shadow thereof (“serum exudate from retracted blood clots”). So I for one take any so called positive test for AB on Shroud “blood” with a hefty pinch, nay fistful of salt. The real focus should arguably be not simply on ABO blood groups, but on the mystery connective tissue that presumably accounts for Rogers’ finding hydroxyproline (HP) in Shroud “blood”, the latter a marker for collagen and elastin. I think towards the end Rogers was on the point of acknowledging (in a throwaway sentence) there was some contaminating animal protein there, since there should be scarcely any HP in human blood, except for traces from connective tissue breakdown. Elsewhere I have proposed that the Shroud was painted with the semi digested contents of medicinal leeches that had gorged on human blood (having numerous advantages over freshly drawn blood, like not clotting, due to the leech’s anti coagulants.). Leech tissue just happens to be choc a bloc full of connective tissue fibres, aka collagen, and thus its specific marker HP.

Scorching by direct contact between template removed from hot oven is primarily by a CONDUCTION mechanism only, with a minor contribution from convection and even smaller one from radiation. (Though there may be some secondary yellowing from superheated air or steam that is forced to exit via the underside of the linen if the template is applied from above). It’s the difference between roasting chestnuts and branding the backside of a cow.If the temperature of a branding iron were used to cook a cow, you’d get well done Sunday roast – via two different mechanisms – one using hot air, the other hot metal.

Then, with greater energy input, needed to produce a body image that is visible under ordinary white light – there is a LOSS of the first formed fluorescence. (Suggested shorthand, independent of mechanism: Phase 1: minor changes at lower energy input – producing fluorescence, but no visible yellowing. Phase 2 – at higher energy input – loss of that fluorescence, appearance of visible yellowing). Let’s take that at face value. What could have produced first the Phase 1 then the Phase 2 changes? If it was radiation producing superficial effects only, a mechanism that I personally I find somewhat improbable, notwithstanding ENEA’s Star Wars light sabres, then it would have affected one side of the linen only. The reverse side would be non fluorescent. Is it? Do we know? If both sides are fluorescent, one has even fewer grounds for invoking radiation. One would have to think in terms of a Luigi Garlaschelli’s mechanism that involves baking the entire cloth. I personally am still somewhat unclear as to why that step was introduced. Was it purely to give an aged look to the linen, or did the baking also play a crucial role in allowing those “acidic” ochre pigments to attack and etch the fabric? There is clearly a difference between Luigi’s mechanism and my own, inasmuch as his needs the imprinting first with an extraneous pigment, followed by a generalised heat treatment whose purpose and mechanism is still a matter of doubt, while mine relies purely on direct contact with a hot template to produce immediate scorching. With mine, there is no requirement in principle for ochre or any other chemical pretreatment (whilst not excluding the use of adjuncts, e.g. Lemon juice, that sensitize the fabric allowing scorching to occur at lower temperature making the process more technician friendly). Maybe fluorescent has a role to play in distinguishing between these two mechanisms – or, for that matter, any others that may be proposed. But the problem one is up against is that the fluorescence (or lack of) that we see now may not accurately reflect what might have been seen centuries ago immediately after image imprinting. Fluorochromes tend to be fairly reactive and thus unstable chemicals – if not within weeks or even years – at least over decades and centuries as chemical double bonds become modified by oxygen etc. If Rogers’ vanillin can act like a chemical clock, albeit erratically, then so can fluorochromes that are initially yellow green under uv light.

However, that will need qualifying in view of your comment. One is talking about a metal template that is just hot enough to produce a superficial scorch when pressed into linen – say 250 to 300 degrees C. If the template were to be red hot, then yes it could produce discoloration at a distance. But that kind of temperature – say 700 degrees C and higher, is way, way beyond that which would have been used by a medieval artisan – given it would instantly carbonise linen – and probably set it on fire – if attempts were made to produce a reasonably sharp image from a brief contact scorch off a bas relief metal or ceramic template. Granted there are attractions to thinking in terms of thermal radiation across an air gap from a red hot template, as distinct from contact scorching. Image fuzziness is the obvious one that springs to mind. Indeed, I suspect that it’s the essential ‘fuzziness’ of the Shroud image that endears so many folk to Rogers’ ideas on there having been some kind of chemical reaction between a vapour and cloth – Maillard reaction or otherwise, putrefaction amines or otherwise, reducing sugars, cleverly disguised as “starch fragments” or otherwise. But there are alternative explanations for image fuzziness, image degradation via age related changes being the most obvious.

Do you see this kind of “reverse side image”? http://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/dsc09696.jpg?w=640&h=480 Now examine it with a hand lens. If it’s like the one in my photograph you’ll find it’s not a reverse side image at all. The colour is not on the fibres. It’s coming through the interstices of the weave from the other side. It’s an artefact of light filtering and reflection, best seen when the fabric is on a light coloured (reflective) surface. Light enters the observer’s image free side of the fabric. It then penetrates through fibres to the opposite side, where it becomes coloured light as it passes through the genuine image. That coloured light then reflects back off the underlying surface, mainly (or most visibly) through the interstices of the fabric.

Suffice it to say that I have recently done just that (late last night!) and added the results to my current posting: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2014/07/it seems so obvious now why man on.html Conclusion: the nose area has too much image homogeneity, i.e. Too little information to provide any sound basis for accepting or rejecting either contact or radiation as the image imprinting mechanism. The crossed hands area however, with the image depleted area on the abdomen in the immediate vicinity of the crossed hands, is precisely what one might have predicted for a contact only mechanism, with no evidence that I can see for image imprinting across air gaps, even ones of a centimetre or two, Sorry if Prof Fanti views these and other comments as trial by internet.

I try to look at these images as if seeing them with no prior knowledge of what I am supposed to see (according to others whose observation and interpretation I regard as no better or worse than my own). When I look at the area in question, I do not immediately say “Ah, there’s something there that is not just blood, but a wound from which blood flowed”. In fact, while I see the sharper outline on that upper part you refer to, I still don’t see it as “spear shaped” notwithstanding elliptical curves and right angular corners. And while with the eye of faith I might see your “twisted rivulet shapes” would one not see a higher density of pigment lower down if there had been flow under gravity? The drawback in the approach you and others take in focusing on particular areas in search or one or other feature that matches the biblical account is that you do not apply the same level of scrutiny to the rest of the Shroud. So whose to say that your elliptical curves and right angular corners are not to be found elsewhere, like the feet etc where the putative wound is from a nail rather than a spear? (Nope, I haven’t checked and am unlikely to do so). What you have to bear in mind is that I was not saying there is definitely no spear wound. I was taking issue with Giulio Fanti for circling an area in yellow, stating categorically that was the site of a wound. That is not objective science, as he could show by giving that same image to people in the street, and asking them to circle the site of a wound. Sorry, but my position is that if ain’t objective science, then it’s not science at all, and if proselytised as if it were science, by Associate Professors of Mechanical Engineering etc. Then this retired science bod feels compelled to label it “pseudo science”. I’m prepared if necessary to canvass the Royal Society on this and the other liberties that are being taken, such is the strength of my feeling on the matter.

The authors themselves make the distinction between fibrils and microfibrils in their text and captions. Comparing that Fig 7 (an SEM picture so presumably somewhat shrunken due to dehydration) with your Fig 5, and taking your word that yours definitely is x1000, which i have never doubted, I still think you are seeing fibrils.

I’ve used it in my current post – the last for a while – suspecting it has immense significance where the reported brittleness of Shroud image fibres is concerned.

The question I ask myself is whether the interior of the fibre really was devoid of colour, or only seemed that way, relative to an intense coloration on the surface. A faint colour in the interior could/might still account for a lot of total light absorption, at least by transmitted back light across the entire diameter of the fibre, on account of the relative dimensions of SCW and any sub microscopic surface layer (PCW or acquired coating) as proposed in my posting.

It is these fibres that are described as “elementary fibres” in the literature. That may be in order to distinguish them from bast (stem) fibres in unretted flax stems that are bundles of those same elementary fibres but cemented together with pectin etc. Retting rots away the latter, releasing the elementary fibres that are spun into multi fibre threads for weaving Now then, when you look at a linen elementary fibre under a microscope, low power, maybe with polaroids, in addition to the nodes aka dislocations, then you may, if you’re lucky and focus carefully, be able to see the microscopic strand like structures within the elementary fibres that are cellulose fibrils. So one does not need SEM merely to detect the presence of cellulose fibrils – only to see their fine structure. I’ve seen references to microfibrils and even nanofibrils. Maybe it’s those you are thinking of, and maybe equating “elementary fibre” with fibril or microfibril? An elementary fibre is one or more elongated nucleated cells, fused together. A fibril is at the subcellular level. So, to summarise: given the high magnification of your photo 5, I don’t think it’s a thread you see there with its elementary fibres. I think it’s an elementary fibre, showing internal, closely packed cellulose fibrils. First, compare with your x400 pictures which you agree show single (elementary) fibres – NOT whole spun threads comprising scores of fibres. Secondly, your picture 5 shows bundles of our contentious ‘wotsits’ that are SHEATHED. There is no sheath on a thread, but the fibrils of an individual elementary fibre ARE within some kind of sheath, presumably the primary cell wall, and the bundle of cellulose fibrils collectively comprise the secondary cell wall..

Only the abstract is available, The abstract alone, and selected free pages (well spotted Hugh!)is interesting, at least to those of us who are intrigued by the report that TS image fibres are fragile and prone to fracture (hardly likely if the imaging process were confined purely to the PCW or an impurity layer). Abstract: The deformation behaviour of single elementary flax fibres was investigated in an ESEM, using a modified loop test. Plastic deformation starts on the compressive side of the loop, whereas fibre failure occurs on the tensile side of the loop. The primary and the secondary cell wall show a different deformation behaviour. The primary cell wall breaks in a brittle manner, whereas in the secondary cell wall, due to its fibrillar nature, a coarse crack grows, bridged by fibrils. The secondary cell wall was found to split relatively easily along the length direction, indicating that the lateral strength of the fibre is lower than its tensile strength, which also accounts for the lower compressive strength of the fibre compared to its tensile strength. Bos and Donald http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2 FA%3 A1004650126890?LI=true This paper refers to flax, not linen fibres, and says the fibrils tend only to separate along the length axis, it being the PCW that snaps across its width. But we are dealing with linen post retting that has lost its pectin cement between the fibrils. That might explain that very pretty photograph of yours (No. 5 in the series) with scorched cellulose (micro?) fibrils that have snapped across their diameter. If enough fibrils break, that would be catastrophic where the integrity of the whole fibre was concerned, would it not? Brittle is the word that springs to mind. Methinks there may still be quite a bit more mileage in the “scorch hypothesis” – if only for generating new approaches for looking at Shroud image v non image fibres. Maybe Turin’s shadowy Prof Gonella has a few more stray Shroud fibres ‘in safe keeping’ in a bottom drawer he could spare, assuming he did not give his last one to Ray Rogers for the latter’s one “spliced” fibre demolition job on the radiocarbon dating… PS: have just discovered that Luigi Gonella is sadly no longer with us (died 2007).

I especially like the final paragraph.Do you acquire a halo when you return to the Father’s business. Does it imprint images on nearby soft furnishings? Back here on planet earth, I’m still at home, with a very basic microscope. But wasn’t that how Rogers did his work for his 2005 Thermochemica Acta paper – at his home, being retired, like me, with some threads (non image threads) though admittedly, one suspects, with a superior microscope? He was an explosives expert you know, applying thermochemical methods to judge their shelf life and safety. I’d have been very wary about taking him on where his own specialty is concerned. If only for that reason, I’d have asked why, when wishing to discount the scorch theory, he resorted to physiological evidence based on 4 hydroxyproline in blood (criticism of which I have voiced on numerous previous occasions). You see John, while I claim to have no specialist skills of direct relevance to the Shroud, I did spend most of my career in and around medical schools and hospitals and plant based research laboratories, so my ears prick up as soon as a thermochemist quickly exhausts his thermochemical armoury and has to resort to a physiological argument – and a highly contentious one in my view – to discount a heat scorch. And let’s not forget that STURP no less was at pains in its short Summary to state that the Shroud image bore close resemblance to the kind of chemical change (carbohydrate dehydration – not a Maillard reaction in sight) produced by by heat or acid – a scorch in all but name. Yes, Ray Rogers and I would have a lot to talk about if he were still here, but I would have wished those chats had been in 1988 before he went down the Maillard reaction route. If already on that path, I’d have wasted no time in getting him to check out nitrogen distribution in image v non image areas, a point I made earlier this morning on a different thread, and to ask whether he really thought that starch impurities could provide enough “reducing sugar” (intact starch having scarcely any reducing properties). As for dogma, or lack thereof, I report all my findings, AND thoughts, in real time, which means I can say things I later regret, like suggesting as I did here two days ago that the nodes of linen are the favoured pyrolysis zone, or that amorphous cellulose is the target molecule (yes, my session yesterday with the microscope is causing me to have second thoughts through imagining that my harshest critic is looking at the same fields as me, questioning my observation and objectivity). Maybe you aren’t aware that I describe my interest in the Shroud as a personal journey of discovery, reported in real time as a stream of consciousness, sometimes impaired (it’s called advancing senility). That’s why my project is blog rather then pdf or conference based. If you and others think it’s a personal campaign to attack religious faith, then you are mistaken. I’m only here for the science, good, bad or indifferent, and as a retired science bod I know probably better than you how deceptive research findings can be at first sight, and how one must always be willing to play Devil’s Advocate with one’s own data and interpretation thereof, and to try and do that before the howling mob descends with its charges of pseudo skepticism, heresy and worse.

Intact hemoglobin? If so, one should be able to get it to migrate on electrophoresis gels, or through gel filtration, and show by use of standards that it’s the real Mc Coy. I’m not aware of such evidence for intact hemoglobin, are you? So a crucial link in the evidence is missing, is it not, while anticipating the rejoinder that I’m simply asking too much of the Redeemer’s blood. OK, so let’s jump to the far end of the scale, where there’s still an intact free porphyrin, a very stable molecule by all accounts, which is what remains after globin and iron have been stripped out. A porphyrin chemist like Adler would have known precisely how to extract the free porphyrin of ancient blood, if suspecting that Hb was at intermediate states of degradation. So what’s the next step? It’s easy, because I’ve done it, or rather encountered free porphyrins on TLC plates. One needs only traces there to detect them by their intense red fluorescence under uv, so all Adler and Heller needed to do was run Shroud porphyrins against known porphyrin standards (of which Adler at least must have had a library of variants). Tell me this, Kelly. Did you ever read of such a simple straightforward experiment being done – i.e. To isolate the free porphyrins of Shroud blood, and run them against standards (and maybe do a mass spec fingerprinting on eluted pigment?). I have not (which is not to say the data are not there, but if that’s the case, then why is it not publicized?). What we see instead are uv/visible spectra of pigments which are the bluntest of instruments in tetrapyrrole chemistry (excluding the Soret band of porphyrins) and when an anomalous spectrum is found for Shroud porphyrin, we see Adler immediately rushing to construct exotic hypotheses based on bilirubin and crucifixion trauma, presupposing a narrative that he and his STURP colleagues were supposed to be testing, not assuming, when instead he should have been doing more experiments, like TLC or GLC mass spec to identify it chemically. That’s just hemoglobin for starters. Am I allowed to go back to calling it haemoglobin now?

Three nights in Krakow last year was a amazing experience, but didn’t do much for my Polish, so it’ll take a little time to find what was done. For the moment, all I would say is that a 3 D enhancement can only be as good as the starting template and one can only speculate as to how good a template needs to be to produce a Shroud image. Crude bas relief in metal? Or a facsimile of a real face or person using plaster, or a fuzzier version thereof using, say, Garlaschelli’s powder technique? And who’s to say that centuries of ageing have not improved the final image in a purely aesthetic sense, with softer tonal contrasts etc? The first priority was to show that a 3 D enhancible negative Shroud image can/could be produced in principle, ie. That there are no insurmountable scientific obstacles. I believe that has been already been achieved, if not by the ones you show (though promising) certainly by Garlaschelli, and I’ve produced some passable results myself using simple shallow metal bas reliefs (horse brasses, trinkets etc). I realize that none of this will make the slightest impression on true believers, but it’s a fact that hot solids do tend to leave a slight impression on linen, one that is a negative image, 3 D enhancible etc etc. OK, so it’s not going to be hung in any art galleries, but there you go.

Put another way, you can never know until you try, and until there is an agreed set of scientific criteria that have to be met (excluding other, non scientific ones like aged appearance, aesthetic appeal etc). Oh, and “null set” is hardly scientific language either ( being simply a set that is empty, a set with no members). What possible relevance can set theory have for reproducing an image, especially when the mechanism that produced the image is unknown? It’s by attempting to reproduce the (main features) of the Shroud image that one may gain an insight into mechanism – so it hardly makes sense to make an a priori declaration that the task is futile, based on misapplied set theory that is in the realm of algebra and logic, not science.

Accepting the radiocarbon dating does not make one a “pseudo skeptic”, or indeed a pseudo anything, far less a deceiver, or liar, or blog troll, or heretic, or any of the other terms of endearment that fly around this site.

But I do have gut instinct, nurtured by a all consuming interest in current affairs, politics etc etc, so while I agree that there is probably no strong direct connection between the Templars (given that the last Grand Master and his lieutenants were dispatched in 1314 at the earlier end of the radiocarbon dating) I do think there was a cause and effect relationship between the events of 1314 and the first documented showing of the Shroud in 1357. Some of the features of the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge hint at such a connection. Most of these ideas have been drip fed to this site over many months, but here’s something that I bashed off hastily earlier, before you put in your appearance on this thread, thinking an opportunity might present itself to post here as a comment. Seems I must be prescient – you have provided just such an opportunity: The Templar Shroud of Lirey (Mk1 and 2) now Turin Initially intended as a memorial to Jacques de Molay , last of the Templars, and to the manner of his death. (1314, Paris, slow roasted at stake) There was no corpse, possibly no ashes except for ghoulish souvenir collectors, so no headstone. Yet he was or had been head of a powerful order that probably had surviving members, certainly outside of France, who had means, one of whom wanted something more than memories. He hit on the idea of a striking wall hanging, to be seen initially by a tiny circle of surviving crypto Templars only. The decision was made to represent De Molay as if Christ laid out on a burial Shroud, but with a difference. The image would show that of a man at an intermediate stage of being burned, or rather roasted. The linen would be expensive, as per biblical account, The L shaped poker holes were there from the start. They were intended as a cue to the viewer to see the image as a scorch, as if a hot man had transferred heat to the linen. This is of course a metaphor – nobody is suggesting that a real man was used to produce the image, at least not directly by scorching from hot flesh. So how was the image produced? Probably use of heated metal or ceramic template, or by powder frottage, or a combination of the two. Garlaschelli used frottage to obtain an imprint from the body of a student volunteer, but a number of modifications were needed he said – like using a template for the face, like finishing the fingers with manual artwork (thus their unnatural length). Blood? Given the figure was intended to look Christ like, while actually that of J de M, there is no reason why some nominal signs of crucifixion were there initially, say palm or wrist wounds and a lance wound. That is all one sees in the 1516 Lier copy. Alternatively there may have no wounds, no blood at all initially. The “blood belt” of Ian Wilson on the Lirey badge? That may have been an attempt initially to represent a chain, as used for burning at the stake, that was later touched up with blood. At some stage, someone, no doubt the de Charny family, saw the potential in morphing the image of a Templar completely into that of Christ, and passing it off as a genuine burial Shroud. But they had to be very careful how that was done, so as not to be accused of peddling a fake. But there was a big incentive anyway to regularise the Shroud, to strip it of its Templar symbolism, and re invent it entirely as a Christian relic. How did the Mark 1 version look at first showing, in 1357 or thereabouts? Fortunately we have the Lirey medallion, that strangely neglected artefact to provide guidance, and probably its curious omissions, inconsistent with a crucified Christ, that are responsible for it receiving so little attention and languishing in the basement of the Cluny museum. The man on the Lirey Shroud does not look Christ like – note the short hair – he has no obvious body wounds on hands, feet or side, no bloodstains on head or other attempts to represent a crown of thorns, no scourge marks. But it’s clearly modelled on the Shroud, as shown by the herringbone weave. Arguably the man depicted could be seen as someone in some acute degree of discomfort, going by tilt of head, the hand being where they could protect privates from heat, and it’s even possible that there is an attempt to represent knees burned to bone. Morphing the image: itt is a matter of painting on blood in all the biblically correct places. Wrist location of nail wound? Some see as it as telling us what the Bible and early artists omitted to mention – that the wrist is better mechanically, at least with unsupported feet. But there’s another explanation. The artist mistook the bones of the palm, with metacarpals shown prominently through thin skin, as fingers, and placed the wound where he thought the palm would be – i.e. Closer to the wrist, but not intended to be at the wrist itself Note there are no unequivocal wounds on the Shroud image, ie. No lacerations, puncture wounds etc etc. The identification of wound sites depends entirely on blood stains, and those could have been added after image formation. Blood came before image? So we are told, but it rests on one spot test done on “serum coated” fibres under a microscope, and can hardly be the final word on so crucial an issue (given that blood on top of linen would be at odds with authenticity). There’s more I could add by way of supporting detail, but hopefully there’s enough of a narrative here to account for why there’s only one Shroud (that we know of) with the negative image double image, and why someone went to the trouble and expense of fabricating (not forging) it in the first instance, by dramatic, point making “pyrography”, and why it became accepted so quickly as a seemingly genuine holy relic. No authenticists should be hurt – far less take offence – by the making of this narrative, it being pure imagination (well, mainly).","date":"2013-11-02","mins":"7:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/02/consider-rogers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Consider Rogers"},{"id":"comment-49654","author":"colin_berry","post":"Ah, but you read it John, and unlike the laptop, your brain has no Delete function.

The mineral salts should still be there, come what may, barring laundry cycles(which would have at least partly washed away bloodstains, or the appearance thereof, which is not the case). So while not specific markers, one can still insist they should be there. So where’s the potassium gone? Then there’s that collagen problem. Rogers detected a peak for hydroxyproline (HP) in Shroud blood, and used it (questionably in my view) to support an otherwise shaky thermochemical argument re scorching – or absence thereof. But HP should be a minor constituent of blood, except in some clinical situations like excessive bone resorption that cause breakdown of connective tissue collagen and subsequent release of HP into blood. But we’ve seen the crucifixion trauma explains all anomalies argument deployed – that it too produced raised blood HP levels by connective tissue breakdown. But collagen, animal collagen that is( boiled bones etc) is such an obvious additive to expect in any “forgery” scenario that a specific marker (HP) for its presence has to be assessed for cons as well as pros.

All he has to offer is a pseudo scientific pdf attacking a plausible and promising hypothesis defended with known physics and chemistry, simply because it doesn’t fit with his preconceptions of authenticity. The Thibaults of this world are not part of the solution. They are part of the problem. That is why I set up this site, a spin off from sciencebuzz.com, to root out the pseudo science of Shroudology – and for no other reason. Pseudo science makes a mockery of the scientific method, the latter depending on people willing to go beyond the known facts and advance a hypothesis. Repeat: a hypothesis cannot be demonstrated. To suggest otherwise betrays a profound ignorance of the scientific method. A hypothesis is a construct, a working model, one that serves to stimulate new thinking, new experimental approaches. This blog has over the weeks and months proposed any number of suggestions for new experimental approaches, based on the unproven supposition (i.e. Hypothesis) that the TS image is a thermal imprint. That is all I have to say to Thibault for now. He can rest assured that I will not hesitate to speak again should he produce any more pdf reports that lack the essential objectivity of science, ones that simply attempt to dismiss an existing hypothesis with phoney argument, creating difficulties, nay, insuperable problems, that are entirely in the mind of the author. Repeat: there is NO insuperable problem regarding scorch contrast or intensity, as the photograph below demonstrates. The faintest scorches, close to the limit of visibility, give very satisfactory light/dark reversed and 3 D enhanced images. It was galling in the extreme for Thibault to propose otherwise, based on a totally unsuitable choice of template, and failing to mention anywhere the scores of postings I have done using more carefully chosen bas relief templates. But then they undermine his simplistic and absurdly dogmatic thesis, don’t they? Left: scorch imprints with decreasing intensity, obtained by serial imprinting from heated horse brasses as they cool down. Right: the same photograph, after negative >positive conversion and semi 3 D enhancement in Image J software. Scorches of fainter or intermediate intensity give the best 3 D facsimiiles – there is no problem due to one part of the scorch image being too intense relative to another.

Why are you so keen for me to publish my own pictures when they are essentially the same as yours? Duplicating other people’s work is not something that appeals to me greatly, unless I suspect it to be misreported. My interest has been with the reported fragility of Shroud image fibres which I consider consistent with thermal degradation conferring brittleness. My interest is in understanding where the weak points exist in a scorched fibre. So yes, I HAVE published pictures of scorched linen fibres, suggesting initially that the dislocations were the weak point, followed later by a suggestion that the 15% non cellulosic polysaccharides of the secondary cell wall are additional sites of thermal degradation within the core of the fibre, separate from the more superficial image capture zone.

Neither do I care for the line you are now taking on my acceptance of your photographs. No, I do not think we have established common ground at all. I work with faint scorches, with a view to modelling the Shroud. You produce scorches with excessive contrast, which while having regions of faint scorching – like mine – also have regions of excessive scorching, which you claimed must ALWAYS be a feature of scorching and ipso facto rules out scorching as the mechanism by which the Shroud image was produced. I merely said I accepted your photographs (believing them to be consistent with your poor choice of template). I did not say that I accepted them as a valid model for the Shroud, which is why I regard your microscopy as being of limited validity re modelling, and indeed a potential source of misunderstanding, especially in view of the agenda driven way you organized and presented your findings.

My personal view would have been more favourable if you had not introduced your paper with the fluorescence problem, as if to suggest that the weight of evidence was already against scorching. There are lots of unknowns re fluorescence, notably the precise chemical nature of the fluorescent pyrolysis products at the molecular level, their chemical stability, their volatility. The TS image might possibly have fluoresced under uv when first formed, but if that were due to furfural, say, which you cite, then it’s unlikely there would be any still around after centuries of storage, especially after exposure to high temperature (1532 fire). Furfural is a small molecule (C5 H4 O2) with a relatively low boiling point (162 degrees C) and thus an appreciable vapour pressure at normal temperatures. More importantly, you made no attempt to monitor fluorescence in your own paper, so had nothing new to offer. Why then introduce fluorescence into your Introduction, except to signal that there was in your view a corpse called the scorch hypothesis, one needing a decent burial, and you were about to bang the last nails into the coffin? Sorry, I have no time for your brand of agenda driven pseudo science Thibault. Stick to your chosen profession: diagnosing and treating your patients’ ailments. You are under a serious misapprehension regarding the scientific method. My advice to you would be to leave science to the scientists. PPS Observant readers may note I have manicured the site’s appearance today: there is a new less aggressive title and accompanying message, new background to fill in blank space to left and right of the content. The repeating images in that previously blank space were obtained by taking a Shroud Scope image of the face, adding some contrast, then showing the result of light/dark reversal (“inversion”) in Image J, followed by 3 D enhancement. So folk can see at a glance the iconic features of the Shroud image that arise through modern stepwise processing (conversion of the “photographic negative”, correction, thermographic negative, to a positive, as per Secondo Pia, then the demonstration of so called “encoded 3 D information”. Forget the mystique: in fact nothing is encoded – certainly not digitally – except by via analogue/tactile reproduction, like a gramophone record in a groove. The Image J software simply reads image intensity as height on the z axis above the xy plane). More importantly, one can see that the same transformations are attainable in principle by starting with a thermal imprint (“scorch”) from a heated template (see banner, with my Ghanaian trinket as bas relief template)..","date":"2013-01-28","mins":"4:38 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres)."},{"id":"comment-1793","author":"colin_berry","post":"Part 2 of my reply to Thibault. “Apparently, CB did not read my paper. Otherwise he would have seen than the major part of it is dealing with the microscopical characteristics of ANY KIND of scorch at fabric and thread level and not with the problem of contrast or relief.” OK, now we have addressed the macroscopic aspects, we can deal with the microscopic. It’s immaterial as to which is the major or minor part of the paper. They are both important, but it’s customary to start with the macroscopic aspects first, especially when we are asked to see things from a forger’s point of view – someone wanting to get subtle gradations of contrast. Here btw is a “macroscopic” view of a scorch off a horse brass template (beats a chunk of discarded steel anyday) that has been 3 D enhanced in Image J. I see no problem with contrast. Do you, does anyone, apart from a blotch on the nose – that could be pixellation noise. “Because my model has no slightly rounded relief, CB thinks that all my observations and photographs are not reliable.” Correct. They are not reliable. Why, when others have used bas relief with recognizable images, with subtleties of shading and contrast, do you decide to use a flat chunk of metal with no image as such, merely a sunken plane. It makes no sense to embark on the microscopy if the macroscopic modelling is wrong. By you own admission you have excessive contrast, so it’s hardly surprising that the microscopy should exaggerate differences between scorched, unscorched and lightly scorched. Intentionally or otherwise, you have arranged matters to get a negative result, namely that a scorch is a bad model of the Shroud. No, a bad scorch is a bad model for the Shroud, “Does CB think that with a slightly rounded relief rather than with a flat template, the microscopical characteristics of the color distribution (and all my observations) at fabric, thread and fiber level should be very different ? We are talking about modelling a subtle image, so it’s anyone guess what is meant when you ask if I would expect a difference at the microscopic level between a rounded bas relief and a flat piece of metal. If one image has subtle contrast differences and the other has harsher differences, with excessive scorching, then yes, of course one would expect differences. But at this stage, we are not trying to make predictions, since we have little or no experience of scorching. Where are there published papers? So let’s put our ideas and presuppositions to one side, and simply look at the model scorches in THIS paper, with its methodology, and see how they compare with the Shroud. Are there irreconcilable differences? “In order to produce an imprint one has to apply a hot surface on the linen. I did it with the kind of “crudest bas relief” I used because it was the only mean to test different temperatures, different pressures and different contact times.” Even if that were the case, i.e. That a proper bas relief could not have been used, that would not justify a model that was unsuited to the task in hand. But I don’t accept anyway the claim that one had to use a flat sheet of metal. What is it you were not able to do with a bas rellief that you could do with your quirky flat iron.? Different temperatures? Simply do serial imprinting as the template cools down, as I have done, to get a range of scorch intensities. Different pressures? Press the hot template into an underlay with a metal implement applying light or heavy pressure. Different contact times? Have a pair of pliars or similar handy to remove the template from the linen at different times. Grab it edge on it necessary. “Using a “better” bas relief (in the sense of CB), one can certainly obtain a better “image” but its characteristics at fabric, thread and fiber level cannot be different than the characteristics showed in my paper because the fundamental mechanisms are similar.” The fundamental “mechanism” may be similar at the molecular level, but image imprinting is not just about fundamental science, anymore than any other kind of image making. It’s as much to do with technique. Much emphasis was placed earlier on alleged differences in “contrast”. But they can arise without any difference in the mechanism of scorching at the molecular level– merely by differences in application time, pressure, temperature and ANGLE of contact, as determined by the contours of the template (admittedly out of the operative’s control, once the template has been cast, but by the same token making the image technique highly reproducible – imprinting as opposed to painting or other artwork. And in any case, these characteristics are very different from those observed on the Shroud. Yes, but we are not comparing like with like. Your image was probably a few hours old before being photographed. The Shroud’s image is centuries old. One has had negligible wear and tear. The other has probably had extensive wear and tear. We know from STURP’s work with sticky tape that the (surviving) image fibres are weaker and more prone to breakage than non image areas (a major and much neglected observation). It is hardly surprising that the Shroud would have lost much of its image by now if the latter were, as I believe, a scorch, simply via random breakage and detachment of the more scorched, more brittle fibres. That explains why the modern Shroud image is now so indistinct. It was not always that way. It would not have been the crowd puller if that had been the case (scores of people occasionally died in the crush to see it, even glimpsed from a distance). “Looking carefully at the slightest King George VI horse brass picture (on the right), I can predict what follows: With a microscope: 1) In the darkest parts (nose, hear, crown etc.) one will find all the characteristics of the “scorch” as described in my paper; 2) in the lightly scorched areas, one will find all the characteristics of the “light scorch” as described in my paper 3) In the white areas, one will find..no color (contrary to the shroud) or perhaps some fibers described as “very light scorch” in my paper.” Yes, my image is a model scorch, and so is yours, so there are no grounds for thinking there will be a major qualitative differences between yours and mine at the microscopic level. I have never questioned the veracity of your images of the scorches under the microscope. Why should I? Mine differ little from yours. Why should they? A scorch is a scorch. The key question is how BOTH our scorch images compare with the Shroud. “To summarize, with a “good” template, one will find all the characteristics I found with my “bad template” but on a single image. Meaning what precisely? “I challenge CB to prove that I am wrong but now with photographs at fabric and thread level.” You have ducked (here) out of the major question – why you have rejected scorching, based on model scorches v the Shroud. I can easily summmarise my position: at the gross (macroscopic) level the Shroud image has many of the characteristics of a scorch, as STURP members noted. At the microscopic level there may be differences, but whether they are the result of the image being something other than a scorch or whether they represent the effect of ageing and degradation is a moot point. You have done nothing to throw light on that question. What one cannot do is dismiss scorching without considering ageing differences. (It is possible that with time (no pun intended) ageing differences can also modelled after a fashion, e.g. With accelerated ageing, induced by chemical agents, and/or accelerated mechanical wear and tear. I shall write a third instalment, commenting on the organization of Thibault’s pdf, with its partisan comment not just in the Conclusions, but from the very start, in the Introduction no less, and even intruding into so called Results. It’s not a top priority for me – having published a detailed rebuttal of Thibaults paper back in October/November and having been totally ignored all these weeks. It’s now Thibault’s turn to wait – I have other interests to pursue (see current posting on that alleged Anglo Saxon conquest) and to be honest am not hugely enamoured of Thibault’s kind of “science”.

Better late than never. I propose to deal with them in a series of bite size instalments. Here’s the first: Thibault’s pdf: Page 3/24 “The goal was to try to answer to the following question: How could a forger get the shading necessary to obtain an image?” (Note: he says “shading”, not microscopical characteristics) “It is clear that the parameters are: the temperature of the hot bas relief, the contact time and the contact “intensity”. Yes, the contact intensity, which depends among other things on the angle of contact. There are only two angles of contact with Thibault’s template – 0 degrees (the two facing planes) and 90 degrees (the shallow ledge between the two planes). There is nothing between those two extremes to give the subtle bas relief effect from what a physicist might describe as resolved force/pressure vectors – one that I was as such pains to describe in my reply, using home made graphics in MS Paint to ensure that my point was not lost. Image from part 1 (October 23) of last year’s 3 part response to Thibault. Clearly my point was lost, in spite of all my best efforts. “What is interesting here is that this can be obtained naturally by using a bas relief.” Yes! “If the forger used a uniformly heated bas relief and applied a linen on it, it is possible to have a contact everywhere (necessary condition). Naturally, the contact in the flat areas or small depressions of the bas relief would be light while the contact with higher areas (like the nose) would be more intense.” Yes, but it’s not only height differences above a reference plane that one has to consider with a bas relief. It’s the angle that each point on the template makes with the linen, which can take any value between 0 and 90 degrees. 0 degrees means “square on”, maximum pressure. 90 degrees means tangential to the linen, in contact perhaps, merely brushing so to speak, so virtually no application pressure. That’s a major blind spot being revealed here. “This last experiment shows how difficult it is to manage the temperature to obtain something resembling the TS image shading. On the image on the right, the lateral bands have the right yellow…” We’re only on page 5, and here we see the author attempting to demolish the validity of the scorch model. He does not have a proper bas relief with rounded contours presenting a full range of contact angles to produce a subtle image with gradations of intensity and contrast, yet here he is making invidious comparisons with the TS images which he has not even presented at this stage (they appear much later in the pdf, ie. The Mark Evans micrographs on page 15 17). Page 6: “This problem of contrast has already been discovered by Jackson….” He is now looking to another author to support his unsupported case, based on an inappropriate template. This is the kind of thing one would expect to find in Discussion, not inserted into Results, Page 6 of a 24 page paper no less. This is clear impatience on Thibault’s part to start his summing up and dismissal of scorching. This is why I say his paper is agenda driven. Scientists evaluate all the evidence in their results before arriving at a conclusion: they don’t go proselytising or even hinting at conclusions until the … Conclusions section. Premature conclusions have no place in a Results section. They place a huge question mark over the author’s objectivity. “This high intensity of shading at contact points was necessary in order for the more distant parts of the bas relief to record their patterns on the cloth” With a proper dome shaped bas relief, it is not necessary to rely on heat conduction for the less superficial parts of the template to make contact. The cloth drapes around the contours allowing contact in most places. The only places not make contact would be narrow and/or deep grooves (“crevices”) where the cloth bridges the gap. But there are plenty of examples on the TS where there appears to be bridging, and I don’t just mean the gaps between fingers but that sizeable non image bearing area of abdomen around the crossed hands. Note that I am referring to macroscopic aspects that everyone is familiar with. Microscopic characteristics can wait till later. Reminder from earlier (Page 6): “This problem of contrast has already been discovered by Jackson” There is NO self evident problem of contrast. Any problem, if it exists, is likely to be due to use of a crude template without a dome shape and gentle rounded contours (we’ll address microscopic aspects later). So far I have addressed the issue raised at the start, namely whether a forger could get the shading necessary for the image. One should address this issue first, and separately, before microscopical details. Repeat: we are discussing the macroscopic shading and contrast. There is no need to introduce microscopical criteria at this stage. They can wait. Thibault needs to repeat his experiments with a proper template, and review his opinions re shading and contrast. He should keep his microscope in the cupboard for now – one thing at a time. I’ll add another instalment tomorrow, or Monday at the latest.

What made him turn by degrees into a hatchet man on behalf of authenticity, writing critiques and papers on anti authenticity thinking? Why were there no caveats attached to his first reference to Roman era linen when first bringing starch coatings and saponins into the Shroud literature? It seems to coincide roughly with his discovery that the TS image could be stripped off fibres with adhesive tape, and was exceedingly thin, below the resolving power of the light microscope. Why immediately invoke a ‘starch impurity coating’ when any botanist could have told him to first consider whether the image might reside on the primary cell walls of the flax fibres, assuming the latter survive retting? PC Ws are in the same range of thickness as that proposed by Rogers (200 600nm),roughly the same as gold leaf. Why do the likes of Barrie M.Schwortz and others (invariably non scientists) persistently portray criticisms of a scientist’s objectivity and hypotheses as constituting a personal character attack? Science would never progress if one was forbidden to question the objectivity of scientists, living or dead. Rogers must surely have realized that by volunteering to work on the TS his objectivity would come under a bigger microscope than the one he used to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the radiocarbon dating. There’s a sense in which Barrie M.Schwortz is as guilty, if not more so, of making unjust character slurs on the folk he collectively lumps together as impugning the “integrity, character and credentials” of the late Raymond Rogers. For my part I have occasionally felt the need to remind folk it was not “Dr.” Rogers or “Professor Rogers” but Mr. Rogers (he had no formal research training, which in no way precludes doing first class research). I suggested he had been “used” by those who provided him with TS threads of dubious origin and/or uncertain chain of custody, and that the peer reviewed journal (Thermochimica Acta) to which he submitted his final paper on the allegedly spliced/dyed threads was one that he helped to found and had been a longtime editor. Given he was close to death in 2005 and knew it, I understand that speed was of the essence in choosing a journal (his “own”). By the same token, a little less bandying around of the term “peer reviewed” might be in order for so controversial a paper as his last, one whose objectivity (again) is very much in question if based on little more than suggestions of sampling error or atypical fibres. What’s a typical fibre anyway if one hasn’t ALSO sampled from across the entire TS?

That’s what I used to tell the Biochemical Journal when they kept sending me highly chemical treatises on bilirubin chemistry to referee, but I did once get a personal letter of thanks from the Editor when I said that two very long papers submitted together from a particular Belgian group could be shortened and published as just one. He said he recognized the time and care that had been taken in evaluating the papers’ claims. I do wonder sometimes if Yannick understands the narure of scientific research, one in which most find themselves having to operate outside the narrow confines of their particular speciality, and that applies as much to the late Raymond Rogers as to the rest of us. Prior to getting interested in the Shroud, he was best known for what he published in the field of thermochemistry. I don’t know a lot about thermochemistry, but I have made published contributions in bilrirubin photochemistry, in membrane bound enzymes and especially in resistant starch and dietary fibre, so i am not sure why Yannick should consider one speciality, one background to be so obviously superior to the other. Irrespective, wearing my referee’s hat, the one I was called upon to wear a few score times, and all done absolutely free of charge (referees are not paid for their services), here’s the kind of report I might have filed on that paper which appeared in “Melanoidins” that began with quoting Pliny and 2000 year old linen techniques: “1 So Pliny described how linen was manufactured, using starch and Saponaria as processing aids. What good evidence is there that the Shroud has starch and Saponaria? For starch, all I see in this paper is a red colour with iodine/azide used to test for something completely different (sulphur proteins). Why did you not use the standard iodine reagent without the azide? And why is there no evidence that the cloth has been treated with Saponaria? What is the evidence that it dates back to the Pliny era – scientific evidence that is? 2.Why the need for starch anyway in this Maillard reaction. Starch is not a reducing sugar unless broken down to glucose, maltose etc? Ah, I see you have switched from using starch in your model study to “dextrins” i.e. Partly broken down starch”? Is that a way to get reducing sugar into the Shroud under the cloak of starch? If so, that is not terribly scientific, is it, or even transparent? scientific. And why the need for “Saponaria” in your model. Is it because the Saponaria has pentosan sugars, some of which might just tbe able to break free from the rest of the polymer, and may then provide more of that “reducing sugar” that is needed in your model. Or iare you saying that the combination of starch and a natural soap helps to release those reducing sugars? Sorry, but since your model depends crucially on having some reducing sugars you must be chemically precise if you want it to have any relevance to the Shroud. 3.Now about the other component you need for your Maillard reaction – organic amines. What evidence is there that the image areas of the Shroud have more nitrogen than non image areas? None? I see. And I see you use ammonia as the source of amine in your model studies. Ammonia is much lighter and more rapidly diffusible than a much bigger molecule like cadaverine, putrescine etc. So we have some model studies based on ingredients that we cannot be sure are on the Shroud, except perhaps some “starch” (which is not a reducing sugar) and we are asked to believe that the coming together of putrefaction amines – with no evidence they would ever be released in quantity from a recently deceased individual – with starch/hypothetical Saponaria (now conveniently transformed to reducing sugar) can produce all the image characteristics of the Shroud, right down to hair, moustache, beard etc, despite those being stable keratinaceous protein that would never release putrefaction amines. 4.Sorry, but this journal is Melanoidins. Your paper makes no contribution to melanoidin chemistry. You have simply hypothesised that the Shroud image is the product of a Maillard reaction which then polymerises to a melanoidin, without providing any direct evidence, and your model studies use ingredients that are largely hypothetical as far as a particular piece of fabric in Turin is concerned. 5.If you can provide evidence that there is a melanoidin on the Shroud, with extra nitrogen in the image areas, with evidence for diamines as the precursors, with information of which specific reducing sugar(s) is involved, whether hexose or pentose etc, and better still some evidence for unreacted precursor molecules in the non image areas then it may be possible for me to to recommend your paper for publication..","date":"2012-05-21","mins":"2:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/20/the-valencia-dawkins-challenge-no-consensus-on-consensus/","cat":"challenge","title":"The Valencia Dawkins Challenge:  No Consensus on Consensus"},{"id":"comment-353","author":"colin_berry","post":"I am travelling at present, so cannot give a fuller reply, but will try to post in a couple of days addressing a number of points to do with the Shroud image, which is NOT a photograph (a ‘tactilograph’ might be a better description), yours included Thibault.

What he fails to state in his introduction is that he was in fact described by himself and others as a sindonologist for the duration of most of his 50 years or working life. Indeed it didn’t take long to dig this article from the archives that he penned in 1970 – 8 years before STURP, and 7 years before “Silent Witness”. (Incidentally, I have not claimed or even implied that his appearance in that video clip was the full extent of his “autopsy”, given what follows, where he said he had been working on Enrie and other photographs for many years previously).. Note carefully the IMPLICIT belief in the authenticity of the “Shroud” (my bolding) which I consider renders his “autopsy” valueless as a SCIENTIFIC document, lacking as it does scientific objectivity (e.g. By failing to question the means by which the image came to be imprinted, effectively treating it as though a photograph, which we know it is not). R.Bucklin: The Legal and Medical Aspects of the Trial and Death of Christ, Medicine, Science and the Law, Vol. 10, No. 1, 1970. The body lay in the sepulchre for an unknown period of time and was gone from the place early on Sunday morning when the burial party returned to complete the embalming procedures. At that time only the wrapping cloths were found in the sepulchre. The long linen cloth in which the body was wrapped has been preserved through the centuries and it is this cloth which is known today as the Shroud of Turin. It has a most colorful history which has been traced in detail by a number of European authors. ………. The cloth was first photographed in 1898 by Secondo Pia and again in 1931 by G. Enrie. The photographs of Enrie are remarkable for their clarity and it is the study of these photographs, including life size enlargements, which are the basis of my medical interpretation of the events of the Crucifixion. My conclusion (admittedly harsh): Robert Bucklin should never have been copted to STURP as consultant pathologist. Robert Bucklin was not just a pathologist. Robert Bucklin was a sindonologist convinced of the Shroud’s authenticity while other sceptical STURP team members were asking more mundane questions like “Is it just a medieval painting?”. There should be a preamble added to Bucklin’s “autopsy”, a warning that its author had a long established belief in authenticity that clearly coloured much of his observations (which were based anyway it seems mainly on B/W photos, not the Shroud per se)..","date":"2015-07-28","mins":"11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-206872","author":"colin_berry","post":"I have today re designed my own “Shroud” site, partly but not entirely in response to this type of comment that Dan allows here.

See my sciencebuzz site…. Link It’s based on the fact that the entire hand – not just the fingers – looks rather bony. Some might say that the bones in the palm – the metacarpals – look just as prominent as those (the phalanges) in the fingers. We can discuss another time why the bones look so prominent. I would suggest it had something to do with the template chosen for scorch imprinting. Use of a mummified cadaver was suggested – or – on second thoughts – maybe a plaster cast taken from one – though other explanations are possible). Irrespective, one could speculate that someone came along decades – or even centuries later – looked at the image of the hands with NO bloodstains, and decided to apply blood to represent a nail wound in the upper of the two crossed hands. But he mistook metacarpals for phalanges, which is easily done if one is not an anatomist, and thus we have the “anatomically correct” wrist wound which is on the wrist instead of mid palm where the artist intended. Strange (don’t you think?) that no one declared centre palm wounds as anatomically incorrect until viewing the Shroud, and indeed those centre palm wounds were the norm in pre medieval paintings. Actually, i doubt they were anatomically incorrect if the feet were nailed to some kind of ledge or wedge that supported at least some of the body weight, relieving the hands of a major part of the body weight with less risk of ‘tearing’.

Upon that impressionistic evidence, we see entire edifices constructed, such as that of Russ Breault in that comment of his, claiming to have “proved” the Shroud covered a real corpse, and then going on to promote ‘mystery’ as regards projection and collimation of an allegedly undistorted body image. Strange, don’t you think, that when I announce a qualitative, non quantitative finding, as I did recently regarding the ‘invisible ink’ effect with lemon juice, allowing thermal imprinting at a considerably reduced temperature, I get this immediate response from Mr.Andy Weiss, who stridently promotes an authenticity campaign on behalf of a New Mexico Shroudie museum: Link It just seems to me if Colin is as good a scientist as he claims, he would already be beyond this kind of thing. What I am thinking is his doing experiments and failing to provide measurements and other objective data that other scientists and anyone else can review and compare against their own experiments. This reminds me of what Walter Mc Crone did with his ‘science.’ So we have to understand that there are GOOD non quantitative experiments, like Adler’s with the protease, which can be trumpeted as trophy results, and there are BAD non quantitative experiments that do nothing to promote Shroud authenticity, like mine with the lemon juice, which can be contemptuously dismissed as unscientific.

Why? Because each time the shroud changed hands or ownership it would have come with a bit of back story, no matter how fragmentary or inaccurate. Would the de Charnys have gone to all the trouble of commissioning the Lirey badge to advertise the Shroud yet fail to divulge what they knew about its recent history, had there been any? Would they have had nothing persuasive to say to the local Troyes bishop and then Pope himself when challenged to defend its authenticity? Would they have been willing to lock it away for 30 years under papal instructions if there was even a shred of evidence to support its authenticity? Would they have agreed to the strict condition attached to its re display after the ban was finally lifted, agreeing to each new showing being accompanied by an official statement to the effect it was just a representation, not to be mistaken for the real thing. How likely is it that something that was around under less than ideal storage conditions all those unaccounted for centuries would re emerge looking so relatively new, without a single spot of mildew?

No, that late recruit to STURP, Alan D. Adler, was neither an expert on blood nor on bilirubin. He was an organic/physical chemist who specialized in porphyrins (cyclic tetrapyrroles), notably their synthesis from simple monopyrrole precursors. Porphyrins are ubiquitous in nature, not just animal blood, but plants too (e.g. Chlorophyll). Bilirubin is an end product of haem and porphyrin catabolism generated in the liver and spleen via ring opening, loss of a bridging carbon atom as CO, then hydrogenation to leave a linear, i.e. Non cyclic tetrapyrrole with properties entirely different from those of the parent porphyrin.

There’s a surfeit of detail – it will go over most readers’ heads (and this ex researcher who has worked with tracking fluorescent chemicals was struggling to cope in places). Rather than display in its present form (as a guest posting) might I make a suggestion. Re structure it. Start by listing the alternative mechanisms by which scorching could conceivably produce fluorescent products. Then flag up the key variables (oxygen limiting/not limiting; temperature etc) You could make it one of those dichotomous tree diagrams. Then list possible products (furfural, polymerised furfural, others etc) Then add presence or absence of fluorescence quenchers, age related effects (> or < 500 years), then show where fluorescent RED or YELLOW GREEN products can or might be seen, or are seen, permanently or otherwise. Once folk can see at a glance the range of options, how fluorescence can either arise via scorching OR be subsequently lost, one can then overlay with present knowledge, where it exists, or there again be able to pinpoint precisely where there are gaps or uncertainties in the logic pathway. Sorry to sound like a pedant. That is the last thing I want. It's because your analysis is so IMPORTANT and TIMELY that I think we need to think about how best to display the detail without overloading the reader too soon with a surfeit of detail and complexity.

Who knows, it may be Hugh with his e Bay uv lamp and his school laboratory (which beats my kitchen) who will crack this one. All I have at the moment are some fragments of information and embryonic ideas. Someone has suggested that the green fluorescence of heated linen is due to furfural, I have just looked up the boiling point of furfural. It’s 162 degrees C. That means it will have an appreciable vapour pressure at normal temperature and pressure, which in turn means it will very slowly evaporate. So it could be that the Shroud, if a medieval forgery, and made by scorching, was also fluorescent to begin with, but has gradually lost ifs furfural and its fluorescence over the centuries.Without a time machine, that’s a tricky one to test… Maybe Hugh could put his scorches back in an oven at, say, 100 degrees and see if the fluorescence gradually disappears … Any chance you would be willing to venture an opinion on my response here to Thibault’s attempts to exclude scorching?

But if it is, I hope that it won’t be based purely on the presence or absence of green or any other fluorescence. That is not science. That is witchcraft – unless, that is, one knows precisely which pyrolysis product(s) is responsible for that fluorescence and can develop a detailed physical and chemical rationale. Oh, and let’s not forget that a fluorochrome can be present, but fail to fluoresce under uv due to the presence of one of more quenching agents. One of the commonest quenchers is ordinary ground state (triplet) molecular oxygen. All it takes to quench quinine’s blue fluorescence is some chloride ion. There’s another reason for not being too hasty in rejecting the scorch hypothesis. Like any other hypothesis, there is always the possibility of modifying to accommodate new facts, rather than rejecting outright. An idea I have been toying with for some time is that the linen may have been impregnated with something that acts as a thermosensitizer, making it easier to acquire a “scorch” mark at a lower temperature. The effect that springs to mind is that of “invisible writing”, e.g. Using lemon juice or sodium carbonate. So it’s not impossible that one could end with an “impurity” idea not dissimilar to Rogers’, with the image on an “impurity” coating, but still needing direct contact with a hot template in order to get the thermal imprint and the superficial scorching of mainly the highest fibres. In fact, I steeped some of my linen in lemon juice last night and when it’s dry will see if it’s more receptive to low temperature scorching than ordinary untreated linen. Interestingly I have come across a very recent paper (2011) that challenges the idea that hot lemon juice and its acids attack the cellulose. It says lemon juice on its own can account for the brown colour. It would be interesting to see if I can get an image on linen WITHOUT that pesky green fluorescence!.","date":"2012-10-25","mins":"8:04 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/thibaults-principle-true-for-a-stepped-template-maybe-but-not-an-artistic-bas-relief-with-rounded-contours-and-gentler-relief/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Thibault’s Principle: true for a stepped template, maybe – but not an artistic bas relief with rounded contours and gentler relief"},{"id":"comment-983","author":"colin_berry","post":"Brilliant observations Hugh.

I hope you’re happy with that arrangement for now. There’s one point that I feel ought to be made whenever the topic of fluorescence comes up in connection with scorching and/or the Shroud – namely that one is seeing the ghostly signature of just one several possible pyrolysis products in a reaction mix that just happens to have a fluorescent chromophore. So it is like watching a soccer match under black (uv) lights in which just one or two players are visible on account of having the right kind of shirt. I have to say I have strong reservations about furfural surviving more than a few decades, never mind centuries or millennia. Apart from the likelihood that so reactive a molecule would or could polymerise, on account of that reactive aldehyde function, there is also the fact that it is a liquid at normal temperature and pressure with a finite vapour pressure. Its boiling point of 162 degrees C is actually lower than the most volatile constituents of diesel fuel (180 degrees and upwards). We all know that spilt diesel does (finally) evaporate. So too will furfural, unless it oxidises or polymerises first. (It’s said to yellow rapidly in air). Neither can I imagine its fluorescence surviving polymerisation if, as one presumes, the unsaturated aldehyde group is involved in polymerisation, since that leaves only the two double bonds in the furan ring for ease of electron promotion by uv light. I can’t help but wonder if it’s not a case of “looking where the light is” (I don’t know if you’re familiar with that analogy, of the drunk looking for a dropped coin in the dark on the opposite side of the street from where he dropped it, because that was the side with the street lamp). “Looking where the light is”.

They applied it to individual fibres from that region. Why? Because that’s all they had (working from Rogers’ sticky tape samples with detached, i.e. Stripped away individual fibres). So why expect there to be yellow (image) colour under the blood, given that a minority of fibres in an image zone are/would be coloured, as Hugh points out (recalling that image colour is an averaging by the human eye of a few uniformly coloured fibres and a lot of uncoloured ones – the so called half tone effect. Randomly sampled, only a few fibres from an image zome can be expected to be coloured. Chances are that Adler and Heller had ones that were UNCOLOURED! Thanks Hugh. The blood before image mantra lacks conclusive experimental evidence. Indeed, it’s deeply suspect, and I now have no hesitation in opting for what I consider a more commonsensical chronology, at least in the context of medieval provenance and man made technology, namely that the body image was imprinted first, and the blood second (the latter by a second round of post oven imprinting or maybe even painting), either with real blood or some blood like or blood derived substitute. See also the images (mine, from adjusting contrast on Shroud Scope) that accompanied that posting on Dan Porter’s site. I reckoned there was no visual evidence for blood before image based on particular regions where it seemed that blood had partially detached, i.e. Flaked away. I shall take another look and see if I can’t improve still further the differentiation between blood and body image, maybe using the neglected midtone control in MS Office Picture Manager that proved so useful in amplifying faintly coloured fibres when I was looking at the microscopic characteristics of my final flour imprints after thermal processing and soap/water attenuation.
