It was commissioned, by the knightly Geoffroi de Charny and his wife as a monument – but a monument with a difference. It was not a 3 D monument, of marble or wrought iron, but a novel 2 D monument of scorched fabric, fashioned as if a burial shroud. Why go to all that trouble? Answer: because it had to be a muted monument, one that could be easily rolled up and hidden away, given that anti Templar sentiment was still rife in the Church and State in early 14th century France. Furthermore, it was cleverly conceived as a metaphor that was fitting to that era of French history, specifically to the hideous manner in which the last of the Knights Templar were slow roasted, i.e.scorched to death in 1314, most famously Jacques de Molay and Geoffroi de Charney (Charney with an “e”, who some believe was the nephew of the Charny who died at the stake). Again, I believe the image on the Shroud to be a scorch, a thermal imprint from a 3 D, or semi 3 D bas relief, either metal or baked clay. That makes the image not just a thermograph, but a ‘tactilograph’ too, one that has captured the relief, i.e. Contours of the hot template. That would explain the high degree of ‘encoded 3 D information’ – but note that the latter can be demonstrated with a 2 D sketch alone, as shown by Irene Corgiat with her pyrograph, and here in this posting with nothing more than a stick of charcoal..","date":"2012-05-03","mins":"4:52 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/a-scientists-eye-view-of-how-the-iconic-turin-shroud-image-could-have-come-into-being-a-happy-accident-of-thermographic-and-photographic-inversion/","cat":"3d","title":"A scientist’s eye view of how the iconic Turin Shroud image came about – a happy accident of  thermographic and photographic inversion?"},{"id":"comment-127584","author":"colin_berry","post":"Your comment has a very different tone from your posting, Dan.

Here’s what I was going to say by way of final word re my posting, at least on this site: “The proposition being tested was not that an image that was 3 D enhancible initially had encoded 3 D information that responded to the software. The proposition being tested was that an image that was 3 D enhancible did not necessarily have encoded 3 D information. My proposition, the second of those two, is easily testable by taking an image that has no initial 3 D character, e.g. A shade chart, a flag or artist’s 2 D portrait and showing it is 3 D enhancible. My proposition is a scientific one, by virtue of its testability. The first proposition might conceivable be true, but I can think of no easy way of testing it. As such it is unlikely to be a scientific proposition, and given the context is quite clearly agenda driven, with no consideration or concern as to whether it’s scientific or not. It’s purely apologetics of the kind: “prove that my proposition is wrong”. Sorry. Life’s too short to go proving other people’s propositions are wrong if not scientifically framed such as to be testable in principle. I confine myself to testable propositions.

In other words, 3 D rendering is not unique to the TS, it’s not even unique to the TS and model scorches. It’s simply the way that software programs like Image J interpret a 2 D ‘darkness’ map – any 2 D darkness map. The next target for this slow but systematic model builder is to scrutinize every single detail of the TS image, before and after 3 D rendering, to gain clues as to the nature of the imprinting process. In fact, that’s been happening for some months now. But there’s a major uncertainty that is holding up progress. A contact scorch off a template can be obtained in one of two ways. The first is ‘tactile’. Where the linen is moulded with fingers to the contours of the template (as with Luigi Garlaschelli’s powder or paste ‘frottage’ using a live volunteer, or what I called LOTTO scorching – Linen On Top, Then Overlay). The other is entirely non tactile, where the inanimate template is pressed forcibly down onto linen with a suitable underlay, e.g.several layers of damp cloth (LUWU configuration : Linen Underneath, With Underlay). There’s a subtle difference between the quality of imprints obtained by the two methods, tactile moulding allowing one to capture greater detail especially where there’s abrupt changes of relief and/or angularities (not that there are many of those on the TS to serve as ‘acid test’ areas), albeit with greater risk of lateral distortion if one moulds “too far” round the sides. Interestingly, there is little risk of lateral distortion using LUWU, as mentioned recently, showing comparisons of scorch versus (inferior) paint imprints. One working hypothesis is that tactile and non tactile occurred simultaneously, i.e. In a non authenticity medieval hoax model, tactile moulding was used for the frontal side, non tactile for the dorsal. It could have been inspired by and/or modelled on that artwork ones sees at the top of this posting (Descent from the Cross straight onto J of A’s up and over linen), or what I call the pseudo sweat imprint model (pseudo if scorch technology was used to simulate a yellowed centuries old sweat imprint). There’s some corroborating evidence for that model, especially where the chin/neck is concerned, maybe the feet too. But there’s only so much an amateur can do. What’s needed are model studies in which real bodies and effigies thereof are actively scanned electronically with a mobile tracking photocell on guide rails, with and without over or underlay of linen to see whether or not the TS image can be modelled purely by means of a contact only mechanism. I suspect to be the case, though it’s scarcely more than a hunch at the present time..","date":"2014-12-12","mins":"12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"id":"comment-175958","author":"colin_berry","post":"This would seem as good a place and time as any to stress that this blogger no longer has all his eggs in the one “scorch” basket.

Look closely at the painting (lower, not upper half) and you should see that Jesus is no longer wearing a crown of thorns. Look a bit closer, and you will see that it is lying on the ground, left foreground. So what you see on the Shroud imprint (yes, clearly an imprint, NOT painting) is not, and cannot be a crown of thorns, since that would conflict with the logic and self consistency of the artist’s visual ‘narrative’. Yes, there are dark regions on the head, both frontal and dorsal sides, but they do not extend outside the line of the hair., or if they do (frontal side) only marginally so,and open to alternative interpretation. I would suggest that what the artist was showing there was not the crown, but the copious blood that flowed from the wounds, exactly as still visible on today’s Shroud image, with blood stains in the hair region, but NO crown of thorns, or the slightest hint that there ever was a crown of thorns. There are one of two inconsistencies with the picture, notably the paucity of blood on the corpse (artistic sensibilities?) and presence of a complete upper torso image on the TS, despite the post 1532 burn holes that obliterated the shoulders. However, the latter should have been the cue not to place too much emphasis on the position of arms etc, given the artistic licence (measured and restrained) on display. Artistic licence probably accounts also for the artist’s decision to show a loin cloth on the corpse, and thus on the TS imprint too, though interestingly visible as such on the dorsal side only, while failing to imprint on the frontal side (explicable in an artist’s eye view as imprinting better when assisted by body weight) – imprinting, note, NOT applying paint from a palette. It cannot be said too often, Charles: you are missing the point entirely. What the picture shows without any shadow of doubt is that the TS image was interpreted by that artist as a passive IMPRINT – not a painting, and with blood – from nails, lance in side, flagrum, crown of thorns. So what produced that relatively homogeneous, monochrome, negative body image/imprint? Bodily perspiration aka sweat must surely be the most obvious explanation,and, more importantly, what the artist either assumed and/or wished to portray by linking the TS with the immediate aftermath of removal from the cross (before arrival at tomb and final preparations for interment). Am I the only one to be curious to know Dan’s reasons for cropping that picture? If I had to chose just one picture from thousands to illustrate 16th/17th century perceptions as to the likely origin of the TS double image, if only to counter Charles Freeman’s dud hypothesis, and maybe talk up my own real v pseudo sweat imprint heresy, it would be that one (but necessarily COMPLETE and UNCENSORED!).

I don’t know about you, but I’m starting to tire of being beat up by OK on this smoothing issue as if it were some huge lapse of understanding of the “rules of the game”. (I also consider his standard recourse to thermal LUT mode instead of natural colour to be as often as not an unhelpful distraction, but that’s in passing). As I’ve said before, there are no rules. The mere fact that a 2 D square can be turned into a shallow tile or a skyscraper should be sufficient to tell folk there are no rules, only judgements as to when to stop the digital re processing. My rule of thumb, based on comparisons between 3 D rendered images and scorch imprints AND their original templates, extended recently to comparisons between entirely 2 D images (like that black square above, or my colour coded/BW relief maps, is this: go for minimalist processing, and make no claims that the result is real relief, merely apparent relief. “Correct” smoothing settings? Well.I’ll say this for OK. He has introduced a handy term: “needle forest”. If one has no smoothing then on some images (not all) there is a needle forest due to height expansion being visible at the level of individual pixels. One can then carefully increase the smoothing by degrees so as to get rid of the needles, but go no further. That has been the way I use smoothing – empirically. Theoretical basis? Never mind theory. There is no theory – just common sense. The smoothing control is needed to bring digitized information, strings of 0s and 1s into our everyday smoothed off analogue world. It’s merely an extension of what we did in the pre digital era with our experimental data points. If we had just a few we would display them as a bar chart. If there were scores of readings, then we felt justified in drawing a curve linking up mid points of the bars. I.e. Smoothing the data, converting it from discrete to continuous. Here for what it’s worth is a suggestion to all those, OK especially, who make regular use of Image J. Adopt as one’s internal standard a 2 D graphic that has no 3 D history. Always show what one’s current settings do to that 2 D control. Is the APPARENT 3 D rendered result sensible? Is it minimalist – as my 3 D renderings are always minimalist these days, for the simple reason that I keep my settings as close as possible to Image J’s defaults, and when in doubt I ALWAYS run a check against some kind of internal standard. OK’s suggestion that I am a slave to a particular set of parameters is simply not true. It is total misrepresentation, especially with that allusion to my age. Image J stores one’s most recent settings and applies them initially when one returns days or weeks later with a new image. I inspect the result at those old settings, note their values, and then proceed to experiment with new settings as if using Image J for the very first time. It’s second nature for someone with a lifetime’s experience in scientific research to operate in this fashion, and to keep a record of all settings on the off chance that someone will ask how one obtained one’s results, as TH did earlier, to which I responded with the relevant numbers. As I said earlier, Image J is best viewed as an empirical (“suck it and see”) research tool. There is no need to portray it, as OK does, as some kind of secret garden open only to those who’ve passed his initiation tests. It’s there for everyone to use – cautiously, and with plentiful screen shots that capture one’s control settings for all to see or request..","date":"2014-12-14","mins":"2:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"id":"comment-176596","author":"colin_berry","post":"I’ve now said all I wish to say on this thread.

Am I not mistaken in thinking that in his section on gesso, he has sealant confused with mordant – or at any rate uses the two ideas interchangeably. I have bolded the “sealant” related words, and used italics for the “mordant” related words? “In its report on the physics and chemistry of the Shroud, STURP discussed the possibility of it having been painted but, amazingly, admitted it had not actually examined any paintings on linen. However it did report that ‘colour does not penetrate the cloth in any image areanor is there any evidence for cementation between fibers or capillary flow of liquids’. This was an important observation, even if, due to the team’s lack of specialist knowledge, the authors of the report, Ray Rogers and L.A. Schwalbe, failed to grasp why. Before linen can be painted, a sealing layer of gesso, a binding mixture, needs to be applied, so that the paint can have a surface to stick to. It was a skilled job as, if the gesso penetrated below the surface, then the flexibility of the cloth would have been lost, an important consideration when a flag needs to flutter in the wind or a cloth is dramatically unfurled. The gesso must cover just the outer fibrils of the linen The details of how to apply it are to be found in the Libro dell’Arte, an advisory manual compiled in the early 15th century by the Tuscan Cennino Cennini. The crucial point is that the gesso has to be applied, not with a brush, but with a knife so it can be put down and scraped off. ‘The less gesso you leave on, the better it is, just so that you fill up the interstices between the threads’, advises Cennini. Over time the gesso surface will have fragmented on the Shroud but arguably this is the brushless outer layer that the STURP team found. (The layer appears to be consistent across both images and across skin, hair and beard.)”. Reminder: Sealants plug the interstices, preventing paint from being soaked up too rapidly as if on blotting paper. Mordants are needed when dyes fail to bond well to fabric, or when paint, usually oil paint, fails to transfer well from brush to canvas. But the TS appeared prior to arrival of oil paints in Europe (15th century?). If it had been painted it would have been a tempera medium, e.g. Egg yolk tempera, when there’s no obvious need for a mordant, being essentially water based (the fatty components of which are well dispersed, thanks to the amphipathic properties of phospholipid coated micelles) So what purpose did your semi conjectural chalk gesso serve, Charles?

A photographic image of the TS does NOT have any kind of relief encoded information. It’s simply a pattern of light versus dark that digital software such as Image J ‘interpret’ as relief, based on the darkest areas of a scorch or negative TS image being the highest, plotted on an imaginary z axis.

I made brief reference earlier to the need for an emitting source of scanning radiation if one’s to get real distance information. The wiki entry on ‘remote sensing’ sets out the two options: there’s passive sensing, as with photography, where one’s dependent on the radiation emitted or reflected by the ‘terrain’ of interest. Then there’s active sensing, where one aims one’s scanning beam, and collects reflected radiation. Only the latter can give genuine relief information that one encodes and then reads back, i.e. ‘decodes’. Passive sensing cannot give any encoded information, since it’s the gathered light or other radiation is captured by photography which simply reads what it receives with no encoding mechanism except for conversion to pixels. Takeaway message: there is no encoded 3 D information in a photograph of the TS. There is merely a 2 D image that has patterns of light or dark that can be computer processed to give APPARENT relief. But if the original image was not created by photography, but by some other imaging mechanism, there is always the possibility that one will be fooled into thinking that a darker than average feature on the image represents high relief. It ain’t necessarily so. Different imaging models create different interpretations. In my contact thermography model, an intense image area might represent the highest relief, but not necessarily if the latter is highly angular, like a nose say, with only a small plateau area at the highest point, with rapid falling.off. One may well get better imprinting off lower relief that is more plateau like, giving a larger area of contact, and, just as important, a higher resistance to impaction pressure when a heated template is pressed into linen that is NOT on a hard unyielding surface, but placed on a damp underlay comprising several layers of cloth..","date":"2014-12-10","mins":"12:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/09/should-we-be-rethinking-the-vp8-and-3d-images/","cat":"3d","title":"Should we be rethinking the VP8 and 3D images?"},{"id":"comment-175544","author":"colin_berry","post":"“[And] Yet the image on the Shroud of Turin yields a very accurate dimensional relief of a human form.

Various existing images have been claimed to be the “original” relic, or early copies of it, but the evidently legendary nature of the story means that there are many fewer people, even among traditional Catholics, who treat claims of actual authenticity very seriously compared to the comparable relic of the Turin Shroud. The final form of the Western legend recounts that Saint Veronica from Jerusalem encountered Jesus along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin sudor) off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. From that, one might deduce that there was a primary image in sweat (and blood) that then by miraculous means transformed into a fully fledged image. It did after all start with a lady mopping a face with her veil. Why do that unless to remove sweat etc from the face? So attempts to banish sweat entirely from the picture, especially as the Latin term sudarium means sweat cloth, makes no sense at all, and is frankly mere obstructionism. The thesis I propose is nothing to do with the evolution of a legend, or the precise moment a physical act of wiping off sweat became transformed by miracle. I’m simply saying that the medieval hoaxers who produced the TS began by imagining a Veronica like scenario involving cloth absorbing sweat and blood, the difference being that the post Crucifixion image could be marketed as if a REAL sweat imprint, NOT a legendary one that was miracle enhanced. However, they did not need to employ real sweat or any other chemicals to simulate that sweat imprint. A thermal imprint from a heated template onto linen could be passed off as an ancient sweat imprint. As acknowledged earlier, it did not need to be a pure thermal imprint. It could have been chemically assisted so as to imprint at a lower temperature, e.g. The invisible ink effect that one can get with lemon juice or milk, or even white flour impregnation as I discovered and reported recently. In any case, my experimentation is about model building using realistic technology that was available in the medieval era. One cannot hope to divine exactly what was done all those centuries ago.

You can “fit” calcium carbonate into your model, and I can fit it into mine (I’ll spare you the details). But while my model may be wrong, I know yours definitely is wrong. How do I know? Well, you are not the first to have speculated about pigment fall out, or rather fall off where the TS is concerned. I was doing it over two years ago in connection with Shroud blood, or “blood” as I prefer to call it. Here’s a Shroud Scope image I posted of the wishbone shaped bloodstain in the hair: There’s an irregularity in the weave running between the numbers 2,3, and 4. If you look carefully, you will see hang up of red pigment (“blood”) in the interstices of the weave along that line, implying that there has been extensive denuding of pigment in that trickle of blood generally. Now compare the interstices of the weave with the colour and intensity of the body image. If there’s been any hang up of body image pigment, then it’s very slight and scarcely detectable. In other words, blood, or look alike red pigment may slough off. Leaving tell tale signs in crevices, but body image does not. Conclusion: while the body image may be faint, it’s unlikely that what we are seeing is the remnant of a painted on image using classical artist’s pigments (it not being unreasonable to assume that if blood pigment has detached over centuries, then so might or would the other pigments). Finally, you still do not appear to appreciate that the 3 D properties of the TS image, as revealed by computer software converting image intensity to pseudo relief, is something totally from the artist’s technique of conveying 3 D form. The latter depends on patterns of light and shade as seen when light is coming mainly from a single direction that is at an angle to the normal. But the TS image is non directional – its 3 D properties have nothing to do with angled illumination, being neither a photograph nor a painting. Any theory of the TS has to account for the 3 D properties, taking account of non directional image characteristics. You have chosen totally to ignore the chief characteristic, indeed peculiarity of the TS image Charles..","date":"2014-12-10","mins":"8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/09/should-we-be-rethinking-the-vp8-and-3d-images/","cat":"3d","title":"Should we be rethinking the VP8 and 3D images?"},{"id":"comment-175553","author":"colin_berry","post":"Serial imprinting, OK, gives a quick idea of the kind of superficiality that is achievable with scorching. One heats up the template until a test swab is quickly scorched. One then imprints quickly, to get an intense image, then again, and again, as it cools, to get a series of progressively fainter images, and finally no image at all (even though the template still hisses and steams when held under the tap). As I say, there’s no reason for thinking that the final images cannot be as superficial as Rogers’ estimate of TS image thickness (200 600nm). There’s another experiment I reported way back that suggests scorch images can be highly superficial. Strip off the epidermal layer (just one cell thick) from an onion’s inner scale leaf, and leave it to dry out overnight, when it becomes like rice paper. Each ‘skin’ comprises two primary cell walls,each probably some 100 200nm thick according to the literature on plant cells generally, plus some dehydrated cytoplasm and vacuolar inclusion. Let’s say a total thickness probably in the region of 600nm max. One can place that dried onion epidermis, reminder, just one cell thick, onto linen and imprint briefly with a heated template. Result: an intense red brown scorch (probably including Maillard browning products) without seeing any scorching whatsoever of the underlying linen. Even intense scorches can be highly superficial, though I don’t have the figures to prove it (but then nor does anyone else, despite claiming the TS image to be “uniquely superficial”, unobtainable by anything so crude as a contact scorch etc etc etc etc). Alternatively, one can sensitize linen to make it more susceptible to taking a scorch at a lower temperature, e.g. With lemon juice or milk (the invisible ink effect). It’s then pretty certain that the scorch is not just pyrolysed flax carbohydrates (primary cell wall initially?) but Maillard browning products too formed between reducing sugars in the additive and proteins and other sources of free amino groups.. It remains to be seen how the image thickness compares in that situation with untreated linen. It might be thicker, or, there again, it might conceivably be thinner..","date":"2014-12-10","mins":"11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/09/should-we-be-rethinking-the-vp8-and-3d-images/","cat":"3d","title":"Should we be rethinking the VP8 and 3D images?"},{"id":"comment-175568","author":"colin_berry","post":"That’s a totally misguided notion you have there, OK, namely that a superficial layer had to be planned that way with advanced technology. Medieval man could pour olive oil onto a pond and get rainbow coloured oil films even thinner than the TS image layer. It required no effort – being the result of natural forces. Scorching of linen carbohydrates is an endothermic reaction under non standard conditions (where steam and other pyrolysis gases dissipate heat). It’s probably that which limits the thickness of the image layer, especially at lower temperatures in the region of 250 degrees C which cause selective pyrolysis of hemicelluloses of the superficial primary cell wall. The bulk cellulose of the fibre core is a lot more resistant to pyrolysis. In short, a combination of physics, chemistry and botany limits the depth of penetration of a scorch, especially if the template’s initial temperature is tested with scrap linen to ensure it gives no more than a light scorch at its first pressing. What is also important (and invariably overlooked in the anti scorch literature) is the use and need for a damp underlay/overlay (depending on configuration) that serves as a heat sink for conducted heat, preventing excessive scorching, helping to protect the core cellulose while the more superficial PCW is selectively scorched. Too many folk who should no better have been in far too much of a hurry to dismiss thermal imprinting as a model system, failing to do properly designed experiments. Were they to have done so, they would have realized that it’s not the brute force method they had imagined highly superficial scorches can be produced to order, even if no one in the 20th/21st century has got round to measuring the precise depth of penetration. Oh, and let’s not forget that TS image threads are mechanically weaker than non image controls, suggesting that the zone of pyrolytic (or Maillard) chemical action is maybe not as superficial as we have been led to believe..","date":"2014-12-10","mins":"12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/09/should-we-be-rethinking-the-vp8-and-3d-images/","cat":"3d","title":"Should we be rethinking the VP8 and 3D images?"},{"id":"comment-175378","author":"colin_berry","post":"AS you say, Hugh, the colour was for illustrative purposes only.

The validity or otherwise of a particular image forming mechanism that may or may not match the TS image hardly hangs on whether the perpetrator was confident or not in fooling all the people all the time (he certainly wasn’t successful where that Bishop Henri de Poitiers was concerned). When in doubt, look at what happened, not what might have happened in an imagined worst case scenario. After a lengthy period – some decades of being banned from display we’re told – the TS gradually acquired, if not credibility as a genuine relic, at least respect as an unusual, and indeed unique item of devotional art. How was that acceptance achieved? None of us can hope to read the medieval mind, and it’s unfortunate, indeed curious, that we don’t have an ample written archive that would attest to pilgrims’ reactions on first encountering the TS. But we do have that of the Bishop of Geneva in 1614, St.Francis de Sales, with his profuse references to sweat and blood. That gives a clue MAYBE to the increasing success of the TS over the decades and centuries – that folk of that era scarcely gave its provenance and/or authenticty a second thought. Why? Because they were told it was the imprint left by Jesus on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen? If they asked what was the nature of the imprint, might not the answer have been: “Well you can see the blood. Use your imagination: that would not have been the only bodily fluid that would leave that faint imprint you see before you. Have you forgotten something maybe? Veil of Veronica? Sudarium? Sweat cloth?” For the body image to be accepted as one left by sweat, and subsequently mellowed for 13 centuries, then a faint scorch from a template may well have been seen as the optimum solution, despite a hefty investment in R&D to get things right. So yes, the plan may well have stipulated a light scorch, in preference to a heavy one, especially as a multitude of scourge marks (372 we are told) and other blood stains would have helped to define what otherwise might have been a inconspicuous ghost like image. Get the blood right, and that same insubstantial image becomes a big selling point, through being under rather than overstated..

I’ve bolded the key section: “Twill fabrics technically have a front and a back side, unlike plain weave, where the two sides are the same. The front side of the twill is the technical face and the back is called technical back. The technical face side of a twill weave fabric is the side with the most pronounced wale. It is usually more durable, more attractive, and most often used as the fashion side of the fabric. This side is usually the side visible during weaving. If there are warp floats on the technical face (if the warp crosses over two or more wefts),there will be filling floats (the weft will cross over two or more warps) on the technical back.

The main complaint this retired biomedical scientist with 12 years additional research in the area of plant polysaccharide (dietary fibre) research is concerned is that Raymond Rogers, having been invited to lead STURP’s chemical investigation of the TS, did not bother to acquaint himself with the detailed chemical structure of flax and linen fibres at the microscopical level. He repeatedly referred to them as if they were simply pure cellulose, referring just occasionally to chemically reactive and thus easily pyrolysable hemicelluloses and pectins as if “impurities” and never making a single reference to the superficial hemicellulose rich primary cell wall (PCW), and choosing to lumber shroudology instead with an entirely hypothetical entity – the starch/saponin allegedly image receptive impurity coating. It’s time for a realistic assessment of the sadly deceased.Ray Rogers’ strengths and weaknesses as an experimentalist and STURP team leader. With no disrespect to the dead (science being indifferent to its practitioners’ birth and death dates) it’s time that some took Ray Rogers off that pedestal and ceased referring to him as a scientific “great”. The latter description is simply not borne out by the facts, especially his googleable published work. I repeat: Ray Rogers had been a relatively anonymous middle level scientist, only acquiring a high profile AFTER acquiring visibility in his role as STURP team leader..","date":"2014-09-14","mins":"9:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/14/a-defense-of-ray-rogers-on-the-image-at-the-thread-and-fiber-level/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Defense of Ray Rogers on the Image at the Thread and Fiber Level"},{"id":"comment-453","author":"colin_berry","post":"Bless….","date":"2012-08-09","mins":"6:59 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/06/i-think-i-now-know-why-sturp-chemist-raymond-rogers-thought-there-was-hydroxyproline-in-the-blood-on-the-shroud-and-its-to-do-with-those-medicinal-leeches/","cat":"collagen","title":"I think I now know why STURP chemist Raymond Rogers detected hydroxyproline in the blood on the Shroud – and it’s to do with those medicinal leeches…"},{"id":"comment-1123","author":"colin_berry","post":"“(Some marks on the breast that clearly look pinkish in my Picasa photo edit of the Shroud Scope breast area, and that can be considered an applied pigment, are missing in the detailed backlit photo of the patch forearm.)” I’m intrigued by that comment, Adrie, but am somewhat puzzled too.

There is an alternative strategy – which is to obtain profiles of unaltered carbohydrates, and to deduce (by comparison with non image areas) which classes of carbohydrates have been modified. The technology to do that exists, although it will be destructive. One could speculate that it is the chemically more reactive (5 carbon) pentosans of the primary cell wall that are modified, with the chemically stable more ordered cellulose fibres being largely unaffected. Xylan polymers might de polymerise, releasing free xylose that then dehydrates to furfural, the latter then oxidising and polymerising via condensation reactions to give the yellow and tan products (see the Comments above for details)..","date":"2013-10-14","mins":"5:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/10/11/a-possible-new-approach-to-learning-more-about-the-chemical-make-up-of-the-shrouds-image/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"A possible new approach to learning more about the chemical make-up of the Shroud’s image"},{"id":"comment-424","author":"colin_berry","post":"Ah yes, the time honoured ploy of playing the contamination card.

It’s way in excess of the Q10 of 2 or even 3 that Rogers cited, making it sound as though the Maillard reaction were a typical reaction in kinetic/thermodynamic terms when it clearly is not, being far more temperature sensitive as these (admittedly incomplete) data show. OK, so one is not measuring polymerised end product, only the essential first fixation of nitrogen, but if the first step follows these kinetics, and the putative exposure to amine was brief – at most a day or two (if that) – then the final yellow colour that would develop on standing would presumably be in rough proportion to the values in this table. Sorry, but the kinetics and/or thermodynamics of the Maillard reaction (initial step included), in particular the temperature response curve, are all wrong for image formation in the range of normal environmental temperatures – say up to 40 degrees C. The Maillard reaction simply does not fit the bill. It is a process that needs much higher temperatures, say 50 degrees or above, to stand any chance of producing an appreciable yellow or brown colour by the proposed mechanism of brief exposure to amines, even if the subsequent incubation period were to be centuries….

Being such a slow process, it would work with ordinary ground state (triplet) oxygen with unpaired electrons making it relatively inert (surprisingly so). In contrast, bleaching of yellow organic material under sunlight is a rapid process, and probably involves activated singlet oxygen with paired electrons. Singlet state oxygen adds readily across conjugated double bond systems. By interrupting the conjugation that absorbs blue light frequencies (giving the yellow colour) the end result is bleaching – though how permanent is anyone’s guess.

It could be cited as a prime exhibit in showing how pseudoscience and tunnel vision combine to make an insidiously destructive partnership, shutting out facts and the truth, as distinct from opening up fruitful lines of enquiry. Jackson, Jumper and Ercoline Abstract The frontal image on the Shroud of Turin is shown to be consistent with a body shape covered with a naturally draping cloth in the sense that image shading can be derived from a single global mapping function of distance between these two surfaces. The visible image on the Shroud does not appear to be the work of an artist in an eye/brain/hand coordination sense nor does it appear to be the result of direct contact only, diffusion, radiation from a body shape or engraving, dabbing powder on a bas relief, or electrostatic imaging. The visible image on the Shroud is probably not the result of a hot bas relief impressed into cloth, but such a mechanism seems capable of accounting for the Shroud image’s distance correlation, resolution, and similar chemical structure. It does not simultaneously account for (1) the 3 D image residing on one side of the Shroud, (2) observed lateral image distortions (consistent with a draping cloth over a body shape), or (3) expected thermal perturbations associated with physically thick superimposed blood images. A complex mechanism involving more than one process may account for some of the Shroud image’s characteristics, but potential inconsistencies in shading continuity, cloth contact, lateral distortions, and pressure independence may exist. © 1984 Optical Society of America I have bolded up two particular phrases that do stick in this retired scientist’s craw. Why? Because it’s not the aim and purpose of science to show that one of numerous possible/improbable blue sky models just happens to be “consistent” with one’s preconceptions, airily dismissing the rest of the field. Pseudoscience does not get much worse than this… In fact what we see here is downright arrogance – with more than a hint of attempted mind control via preemptive strike… But then John Jackson’s doctorate was acquired from a military academy… God bless America! PS Note too that the abstract refers only to the frontal image, leaving the reader to conclude that the dorsal image must have entirely different properties, given the impossibility of “loosely draped linen” on the underside. That might make the same reader susceptible to the claim made in Feb this year by true believer Stephen E.Jones on his dogma ridden blogsite that it’s only the frontal side body image (plus 1532 scorch marks!) that displays a 3 D response with appropriate software, the dorsal side being as he puts it “contact only”. I have news for Stephen E.Jones – the frontal and dorsal sides BOTH display a 3 D response to Image J, with nothing to distinguish between them. (Click to enlarge) The problem is to get either to display a good response, at least when uploading the virtually contrast less images from Shroud Scope.

Sorry, Olowkow, but you have spectacularly missed the point. What I intended to convey, admittedly without cluttering captions, is that the so called encoded 3 D properties of the TS are not uniquely mysterious, as STILL claimed by Shroudies on a regular basis. They can be reproduced very simply and quickly simply by pressing a heated bas relief template, like my Ghana trinket (second from left) into linen to produce a scorch, and then doing a light/dark inversion, as per Secondo Pia, followed finally by 3 D enhancement in any computer program that reads image density as height above a reference plane (I used Image J, freely downloadable). So where 3 D enhancement is concerned it’s a case of “move on folks, nothing to see here”. Much the same might be said for the welter of mystery promoting (pseudo)science that is promoted elsewhere, mainly on U$ based sites, where the $hroud of Turin is still Big Bu$ine$$.

Good of you to look in. I’m no expert where digital image analysis is concerned, but grey scale seems fairly self explanatory. That said, I’m not sure I’d agree that image superficiality should correlate with grey scale. Why not? Because we’re told that image intensity, and thus grey scale, has peculiar, some might say unexpected, half tone qualities. It’s explained by saying that it is the number of coloured fibrils that determines image intensity, as distinct from intensity of individual fibril colouring. So where you have a high image intensity and high grey scale value, you do not necessarily have a deeper, more weave penetrating less superficial image. All the action, so to speak is in the most superficial surface layer. But it’s self evident that if you have a hotter template, you’ll get a deeper scorch, which might sound like I’m contradicting myself, which in a sense I am. I guess what I’m saying is that in modelling the Shroud image one makes a decision at the outset to use low temperature templates to get uniformly faint scorches (overall), so that any differences in intensity/grey scale are then down to half tone differences, all at the same level of superficiality.

Colin, if you’re following this, I can see why you have suggested the image was first your Templar, then later revised to be Christ. This hypothesis would explain why the linen was fresh but then needed to be artificially aged to look ancient. And before John and Yanonymous pipe in about the absurdity of that hypothesis, I’m not promoting it here.

If the linen were subjected to all those treatments listed by Antoine de Lalaing, whether for the reasons he gave, or as I believe to artificially age, then there’s another problem for the authenticity promoters.

But it can’t be anything else but body image on the right, since it’s virtually the entire moustache and tip of the nose! Sorry to repeat myself, but the Shroud body image has two distinct components – a crust like one that has largely flaked away, similar in behaviour to the aged blood, and an underlying faint yellow or yellowish brown stain. So when you read the old literature and see references to particles, e.g. Mc Crone’s ‘red ochre’ etc, think about the non detached components. And when you read others that talk about the amazingly superficial nature of the Shroud image, typically cited as 200nm thick or less, the need to use pulsed uv laser beams to reproduce, think about the underlying stain.

That takes quite a bit of explaining, wouldn’t you say, and I don’t recall seeing any attempts as yet to come up with a cogent explanation? I have one, and it’s tentative, so am pleased to see your thinking is at least partly along the same lines. Yup, we’re talking about OIL. My flour imprinting works best when there’s vegetable oil prsent, not just to attach flour to the skin initially, but to help colour development in the oven too. The oil helps to ‘micro fry’ the particles of flour, which then proceed to turn brown due to Maillard reactions, A small surplus of oil then acts as a liquid vehicle, allowing that cocktail of yellow/brown Maillard products to penetrate the weave of the linen. The likely route for capillary migration is the narrow channels BETWEEN the fibres, as can be easily modelled with ink ( I did a clip for You Tube back in 2015), so the brown cocktail can get from one side of the linen to the other INSIDE the threads, out of sight, and then, if there’s sufficient, proceed to stain the opposite face where they emerge.. Why an image (of sorts) on the opposite face, rather than a mere oil stain? Maybe the Maillard cocktail deposits solid polymeric highly pigmented melanoidins on its short journey. The latter attach strongly to the fibres, so that the migrating oil gets cleaner and cleaner, finally scarcely visible in the cloth. Leaving the pigmented image on the obverse side roughly the same shape and size as the topside, but not exactly the same (which might explain Fanti’s curious finding that the main and subsidiary image were not quite identical in his computer assisted imaging).

As already indicated, I’ve never been happy with that term ‘forgery’, feeling we may be missing something re ORIGINAL motivation of its fabricators. In fact, I’m currently onto what I believe is an entirely new angle, one that I wasted no time in posting to the ‘Odds n Sods – a Miscellany’ website (see link in my reply to Paul that directly precedes your comment). Here’s what I posted to his site, though ideas based on Leviticus Chapter 6 are evolving as we speak (with Paul I’m pleased to say expressing much interest): Colin Berry Feb 17,2017 11:24 am Hello again Paul. I hope you won’t mind if I now use your site – and possibly your social media contacts too – for a kite flying exercise, the kite in question being a mere 3 hours old! It began with me googling (bible flour). I got to wondering this morning if there might be some clues as to why medieval ‘forgers’ of the Turin Shroud might choose to use white breadmaking flour as an imprinting medium. Suppose I said there was a chapter in the Bible that mentions not only my white flour, that additionally mentions cooking oil (also an important ingredient in my imprinting medium) AND fire AND white linen as well? That would be asking too much, right, to have 4 vital components in my medieval manufacturing scenario not only in the Bible, but in a particular chapter thereof? Well, guess what? There is. See Leviticus, third book after Genesis and Exodus in the Old Testament, Chapter 6 ! It’s about the procedures/rituals that have to be followed by those who have confessed their sins to a priest, and who are required under Jewish law to make a sacrifice. Chp 6 is targeted at poorer folk who can’t afford animal sacrifices, who are told to bring along cheaper food, “finest flour” especially – some to be used as a burnt offering, the rest to be baked into unleavened (i.e. Non yeasted) bread for the presiding priest and hopefully his family especially! Here are two key verses (New International Version): 15. The priest is to take a handful of the finest flour and some olive oil, together with all the incense on the grain offering, and burn the memorial portion on the altar as an aroma pleasing to the LORD. Wow! That’s three of the ingredients – flour, oil and fire. What about the 4th? Linen? Guess what? It comes 5 verses earlier in the same chapter : As before, the New International Version: 10. The priest shall then put on his linen clothes, with linen undergarments next to his body, and shall remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar. (Yes, the white linen has special ritual significance, given what we read in the following verse): 11.Then he is to take off these clothes and put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean. This comment is already too long, Paul, so I shall end here, except to propose an entirely new explanation for the Turin Shroud. Might it have been intended initially to symbolize the crucifixion of Jesus as an Old Testament style sacrifice of Son by Father, intended as an expiation of someone else’s , i.e. Mankind’s sins. That explains why the technology was customized, a one off. It was a gesture on the part of those powerful, privileged folk who commissioned it (the Lirey based de Charny family certainly, based on the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge, but conceivably under instructions from the highest in the land, King John the Good as well, no less. Those two battle hardened knights were linked via their self created chivalrous Order of the Star, said to have been de Charny’s idea, modelled on England’s Order of the Garter). You read it here first! Listen ye here now, you authenticity promoting imaging via nuclear or electromagnetic radiation obsessed tunnel vision shroudologists. You may get away with ignoring my site, basically because I’m uninclined at this stage to involve the MSM (or even so called ‘peer reviewed’ journals, read chum reviewed in many instances). Will you dare ignore Paul’s and others’ internet sites too? Hearing yours and others’ immediate response to this new approach will be most welcome, sheona before I elaborate further. Suffice it to say there are not just one but TWO aspects to the Mosaic laws regarding sacrificial burnt offerings. There’s the obvious one of being required to part with valuable livestock or even the ‘finest flour’ and olive oil (ring any bells?). But there’s another, one I’d missed up till now. It’s the presumption of an anthropomorphic God up there in his heaven who will appreciate the aromas wafting up from the fires on those altars!. Watch this space (or Paul’s website) for more on that “Currying favour with Mr.Big” idea which could be the real explanation for that so called ‘forgery’ we call the Shroud of Turin. Was it intended not just as a sin expiating sacrifice, but, more importantly, as a GIFT too from one or more of the most powerful families in mid 14th century France, including that of the monarch’s too (John the Good, no less) as well as his bearer of the Oriflamme, Geoffroy de Charny, Lord of Lirey and his wife, both of whose coats of arms appear on the Lirey pilgrim’s badge?.","date":"2017-02-20","mins":"7:17 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/01/04/testing-my-flour-imprint-hypothesis-might-those-be-solid-gluten-flecks-one-sees-on-the-shroud-scope-body-image/","cat":"medieval_hoax","title":"Might those be flecks of congealed wheat gluten one sees on the Turin Shroud?

(My question) “Why did that MFOL produce two separate images – front and rear – with no sides? Isn’t a shroud supposed to be wrapped around a corpse? So why no imaging of the sides?” ANSWER: “That is the benefit of collimated light. It’s a good thing because otherwise the image would have been really strange looking”. Well, I’ve seen references before now to collimation in connection with the Shroud image, which is another way of saying that it would be impossible without a lens, mirror or pinhole camera to get a sharp image, unless there was collimation, i.e. Each point on a luminous object sent light exclusively to an unique image point on the linen, and all those unique image points corresponded exactly to the geometry of the subject. But collimation requires a collimator, and there’s one tiny drawback: there’s no conceivable collimator inside a 1st century AD tomb. Even if there were, a collimated image would be a pixellated one. Think about it. To get collimation, you would need a series of pinholes in a thick walled membrane made of opaque light absorbing material, such that the only rays that emerge on the far side are strictly normal to the corresponding light emitting points on the subject. In other words, collimation depends on both holes and surrounding opaque tunnel wall that absorbs all but normal rays. But you can’t have holes where you have tunnel walls. Ipso facto, you have to be content with a kind of thick walled colander as collimator, which in turn would result in a matrix of separate image spots, i.e.a pixellated image, and one moreover which is is “pointillist”, i.e. With blank spaces around each of the image spots. Collimation is easy to say, but represents an attempt to regiment light rays without any means of regimenting. Collimation, in the context of the Shroud, is what is known technically in the trade as “Mickey Mouse science”. 😉.","date":"2012-03-22","mins":"7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/ten-questions-for-anyone-claiming-that-a-miraculous-flash-of-light-was-needed-to-create-the-man-on-the-shroud/","cat":"medieval_hoax","title":"Ten questions for anyone claiming that “a miraculous flash of light” was needed to create the Man on the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-65","author":"colin_berry","post":"This post was in fact intended for my new, more polemical Shroud site: http://strawshredder.wordpress.com/ It’s here because of Word Press’s default settings which it omits to flag up at draft stage.

There is a perverseness in their nature – they delight in denying and confounding… OK, now for a brief defence of my position, which I do not propose to labour. My first post on the Shroud was at the tail end of last year. Http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2011/12/turin shroud could it have been.html It’s working hypothesis was that radiation at a distance HAD produced the image, but if it has been radiant heat and white light, then an opaque absorbing pigment was needed, for which I considered pencilled and/or painted on charcoal, and did in fact succeed in trapping enough radiation to produce a scorch on linen. But it was a positive, not negative image, which prompted further experimentation. Along the way I tried seeing if I could image the infrared rays from a hot metallic object (a metal pencil sharpener) onto cloth using a concave mirror, and almost idly, as an afterthought, stamped the linen directly with the hot template to produce a “brand” with a startling resemblance to the original, but for light/dark reversal, i.e. A pseudo NEGATIVE, just like the Shroud is a pseudo negative. My first thought was – surely not? – too obvious! Some two dozen posts later I am now wholly convinced that the Shroud image WAS produced by scorching, with a few remaining details to be resolved, like was it treated or untreated linen? Given the trial and error manner in which that current conclusion was arrived at, with no preconceived notions, and indeed an assumption initially that radiant energy was somehow involved, then I hope you will appreciate why your comparison between my approach – that of a retired science bod with an experimental bent and that of a Flat Earther could not be further from the truth. But I suspect you will have a ready answer to my plaintive protest. Indeed, I suspect it is you who will have a ready answer to anything I say in defence of my position, requiring little time and effort on your part, unlike the many weeks I have spent on this problem. So who may I ask is the real Flat Earther? You or me?

It’s the result of turning an image from horizontal to vertical in Image J so as to obtain a different pattern of light and shade.

The angular nature of the face has always been cited as the chief objection to imprinting by contact, at least in a medieval Garlaschelli style model involving manual moulding, e.g. With his powder frottage. It’s the nose especially that is the problem, giving rise to distortion and other anomalies dependng on whether the cloth follows the contours whether it bridges, leaving gaps. Here’s my solution, in the new flour powder imprinting model. The powder was applied to all parts of the face except the nose. When wet linen was draped over, pressure was applied to the nose (ouch) to flatten it, (more correctly, to deform it by pushing skin and cartilage to one side – left or right). Thus reduced to a little more than a shallow bony step there is, one need hardly add, the corresponding gap in the imprinted image. Remedy? The “nose” was then added, using flour essentially like paint (but they didn’t make a terribly good job of it, did they, the nose and surrounding area looking a total disaster area, at least in the 3 D rendering above?). Self promotion postscript: Obtaining those eyes requires that two things be done as regards LIGHTING, the oh so crucial lighting in Image J. All will be explained in today’s Topic 4. Preliminary results with the microscopy will be Topic 5 later today – a very tricky area , but one that has provided additional clues as to how the image may have been developed in TWO stages – first with a flat iron to fix the flour and see an initial faint image (allowing for more doctoring if needed) then followed by oven roasting to bring up the full (Maillard?) colour, followed finally by image attentuation, e.g. Soap and water. One can tentatively identify all these stages under the microscope in the model system. Matching the end stage with the TS, the latter a centuries old image, will be the real challenge, but things look promising as regards seeing single/isolated fibre coloration – a remarkable phenomenon – though maybe not the so called half tone effect..","date":"2015-08-16","mins":"3:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/15/3d-of-the-day-imprinted-in-a-contact-only-mechanism/","cat":"image_theory","title":"3D of the Day:  Imprinted in a Contact-Only Mechanism?"},{"id":"comment-208356","author":"colin_berry","post":"If there’s one thing that one sees time and again with the trolling tendency, it’s an inability to cope with new ideas, and a deep and scarcely rational resentment towards those who propose new ideas, whether good, bad or indifferent.

Methinks someone has forgotten the difference between heat and temperature, It’s not enough to have the right temperature.

In that sense the paper is a “goodish” conductor, good enough to dissipate the heat from a naked flame into water on the opposite side of the paper.

But that sharp transition between charred and pristine now needs to be re evaluated anyway in terms of heat labile hemicellulose adjacent to more heat refractory cellulose. That’s not to belittle Rogers – far from it – since it was his adhesive tape studies that first alerted us to the superficiality of the image, which as I’m sure you know he interpreted as attached to adventitious starch and saponins, rather than a more mundane botanical explanation in terms of primary cell wall and hemicelluloses.

We could also discuss other details pertaining to Rogers’ reporting of his Maillard hypothesis – like his starting with quotes from Pliny re starch having been used as a processing aid – of questionable relevance to Maillard reactions. Why? Because starch, an alpha 1,4 linked polyglucan, has no reducing properties until degraded, but Rogers then suddenly switches to referring to “crude starch”, but that too is only reducing if accompanied by hydrolytic products (glucose, maltose etc). Then, in his model systems, he states that “dextrins” were used, dextrins being highly degraded starches. Are we supposed to equate “starch” with “a mixture of degraded starch with hydrolytic end products” when they are not chemically synonomous? Or are we supposed to assume that those saponins somehow help to degrade starch to reducing sugars (I see no reason why they should). The entire Maillard/melanoidin hypothesis is like a castle built on sand foundations, and shifting sand at that.

It’s the peculiarity that should have told you the TS was no ordinary painting, whether age degraded or not. You should also be aware that your claim that all the pigment has now disappeared, while conceivably possible (though hugely improbable) is totally unscientific. One has to be able to detect at least traces of original pigment for the claim to be regarded as scientific. Speaking more generally, what those in the world of liberal arts, especially in the UK’s notoriously schizoid and divisive “Two Cultures” society still fail to appreciate is that science (as distinct from technology) is essentially rooted in the world of ideas.

Must be getting senile. Anyway, here it is again if anyone’s interested: Title (still the same): Towards a new, more chemically nuanced model for the Shroud of Turin (with hat tip to STURP’s Joseph Accetta). Think slow release H2 SO4, and maybe iron catalysis too. Summary What we see today is not what the putative 14th century fabricator of the Shroud intended us or rather his contemporaries to see.The Mark 1 image was a more prominent dye/mordant combination, essentially as proposed by STURP’s Joseph Accetta, imprinted onto linen possibly to resemble dried, ancient sweat (with blood additions too). (See earlier ideas on this site re the Shroud being an attempt to produce a life size rival to the fabled “Veil of Veronica”). That Mark 1 Accetta image has largely if not entirely disappeared, as a result of natural wear and tear, bleaching by sunlight, detachment of mordant etc etc, possibly even laundering. What remains is a Mark 2 ghost image, still a negative “photograph like” imprint, one that formed gradually under the dye mordant via chemical action that mimics the effect of scorching with a hot iron. The chemistry would be similar (dehydration, oxidation of linen carbohydrates) but achieved slowly at environmental temperatures by chemical reaction with or without catalysis. The chemicals used in medieval bleaching offer ample scope for modelling of slow superficial “scorching” of linen fibres, especially the acid mordants like aluminium and iron sulphates that easily hydrolyse initially to dilute sulphuric acid. The tendency of the latter to become more concentrated due to progressive evaporation of water and increasing concentration to largely anhydrous H2 SO4 with a powerful dehydrating action on carbohydrates is well known. Catalysis of oxidation by iron salts is an added possibility, given the ability of variable valency iron salts (Fe++ and Fe+++) to facilitate organic redox cycles, acting as intermediary electron acceptor/donors between atmospheric oxygen and oxidisable substrate.The traces of “iron oxide” that Walter Mc Crone and his microscope detected on the Shroud may not have been artist’s red ochre, as proposed, but oxidized iron mordant, e.g. Iron (III) oxide hydroxide, Fe O(OH).H2 O, more commonly written as Fe(OH)3.

Polymerization may well be the key to understanding the basis to the fluorescence of the 1532 burn marks, and why (in passing) it’s a mistake to imagine that the TS cannot be a scorch through lacking fluorescence. The fact that the 1532 burn marks still fluoresce almost 5 centuries later suggests the molecules responsible for the fluorescence are of relatively high molecular weight, almost certainly solids, or they would have evaporated away by now. Candidate molecules, if one is looking for uv fluorescence and high molecular weight, say 300 or greater, would be the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, containing fused aromatic ring systems (5 or 6 carbon). Are there mechanisms by which they could be formed in linen exposed to very high temperatures? Yes there are. Here’s the reasoning. The ultimate product from deep scorching of linen is black charcoal, i.e. Microcrystalline graphite. While the latter is almost pure carbon, its graphene sheets are polycyclic aromatic in structure, ie. Fused benzene rings, and there is no way they could be formed from cellulose etc of linen except via a polymerization process from low molecular weight monomers. But forming those monomers, whether furfural or some other product of pyrolysis, requires high temperatures, considerably higher than those needed merely to leave a scorch mark on linen. Without labouring the detail, or going over old ground, the structure of the flax fibre is probably the key to understanding the difference between light scorching (no fluorescence) and heavy deeper scorching (intense fluorescence). Light scorches probably pyrolyse selectively the carbohydrates of the primary cell wall, notably the chemically reactive hemicelluloses. Heavy deeper scorches affect the cellulose in the core of the fibre, requiring a considerably higher temperature, and generating the monomers that are needed for polymerization on the graphite pathway terminating in charcoal that are responsible for intermediate uv fluorescence. Take away message: it’s false logic or bad science or both to imagine that the fluorescence of the 1532 burn marks precludes heat as a mechanism for TS body image formation. Barrie Schwortz, Russ Brault and other pro authenticity proslelytizers please note: your playing the ‘fluorescence card’ may impress your audiences, but they don’t impress this retired researcher who has experience of tracking fluorescent compounds as part of his research career, and knows rather more than you do about the complexities of the fluorescence phenomenon, and why it can never be used to prove or disprove a case if you know NOTHING about the chemical identity of the fluorescent species..","date":"2014-12-07","mins":"11:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/05/an-interview-with-giulio-fanti-and-more/","cat":"image_theory","title":"An interview with Giulio Fanti and more"},{"id":"comment-175358","author":"colin_berry","post":"If you’ll pardon my saying, Piero, you appear to be confusing pyrolysis with combustion.

Science has no deadline by which to arrive at a guilty/non guilty decision… Indeed , it does not even try to arrive at an either/or decision. Relieved of the time pressure, science can take its time in arriving at a sounder conclusion, based either on new facts, as and when they become available, or upon new interpretations of the existing evidence by those who have with no personal axe to grind. Now then, who has some compelling evidence that the Shroud image is not a scorch? Before replying, here’s a tip. Drop the opposition to the term “scorch”, given it’s purely operational – a discoloration (coloration?) produced by heat. Recall there are three methods of heat transfer – conduction, convection and radiation – and recall there is not just radiant heat (infrared) but visible light, ultraviolet, x rays etc. Then understand there could be three kinds of scorches – those caused by each of the three methods of heat transfer. Then attempt to explain how radiant energy could cause a scorch on linen, and then how it could produce an image. Rather you than me… Conducted heat on the other hand can easily cause a scorch on linen AND an image too which is light/dark reversed (“a “negative”) So we should not be having this discussion in 2012. This is 19th century physics we are discussing here. The Shroud image should have been narrowed down a century or more ago to a scorch produced by conducted heat – requiring direct contact, no air gap – with any disputes centred on technology, not science. We have the purveyors of crackpot and pseudo science to thank for sowing the seeds of confusion. The latter despise the conduction model, because it points to forgery.

The precise mechanism of imprinting – thermal, thermochemical or chemical – is mere detail. Dyeing, which unlike painting involves permanent irreversible chemical bonding onto linen, with or without mordant assistance – is detail secondary to detail, especially as mordanting itself may at least theoretically leave a ghost image, lurking underneath the mordant, if the latter, like alum, were to be strongly acidic (alum dissociates in water to produce sulphuric acid that could discolour superficial fibres).

Whilst the abstract and first page only are available without charge, my worst fears are confirmed: the equipment used was able to detect alements with atomic number greater than 16. That means there could be no indication as to whether or not the TS has either aluminium (element no. 13) or sulphur (element no 16). But as MPH correctly points out, kitchen experiments on whether alum is able to leave a ghost image on linen via an H2 SO4 mediated chemical dehydration, producing (one might predict) an end result that is comparable to that with scorching off a hot metal template, should be relatively “easy”. The advantage over thermal imprinting, as Joseph Accetta points out, is that a carved wooden template can be used in place of metal for dye imprinting. If alum (potassium aluminium sulphate) had been used a mordant, one has a ready explanation for a permanent ghost image that could survive long after the dyestuff had faded, given its tendency to produce free sulphuric acid by hydrolysis under moist conditions. That’s all have to say on this somewhat unsatisfactory posting (with its curious focus on an abandoned Templar link). Reminder: my working hypothesis is (and has been for over a year) that the TS was fabricated to appear as if a whole body version of the Veil of Veronica, in which an initial sweat (and blood) imprint had been captured on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen, and there had been no further image enhancement of the negative imprint, least of all miraculous. So the fabricator’s task was ‘simply’ to simulate ancient sweat, for which it seems reasonable that dye/mordant combinations would have been used, essentially as proposed by STURP’s Joseph Accetta, someone to whom I raise my hat in admiration, especially as he is still thinking and publishing (see his St.Louis presentation)..","date":"2015-03-05","mins":"5:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/checking-in-on-colin-berry-a-new-image-model-forming-in-my-mind/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Checking In On Colin Berry:  A New Image Model  ‘forming in my mind’"},{"id":"comment-192349","author":"colin_berry","post":"I suppose I should be flattered that Dan hoovers up my words within minutes of my writing them, uncorrected typos and all’, to bring them here.

It was the Veronica motif, and the implication that the Shroud had been intended to portray a bodily imprint, probably sweat, real or simulated, that led to a growing disillusionment with thermal technology, despite its ability to account neatly for negative image and 3 D properties. That’s not to say that scorch technology could not have been used to simulate a sweat imprint, but my current posting, nowfinally complete, has me converging with Joseph Accetta in thinking that the TS image was made by imprinting from a woodcut using a soluble organic dye or dye/mordant combination (not to be confused with solid particles of inorganic paint pigments, prone to dropping off!) There is a lot worth pursuing in those ideas of Accetta’s, one very thoughtful and perceptive individual, with scope for more experimental modelling. In passing, does anyone here have access to data from STURP or elsewhere on the distribution of ionic aluminium on the Shroud, especially in body image v non image areas? I’m sure I have seen some passing reference to there being higher than expected levels of aluminium but have mislaid the link. Alum – the most obvious source of aluminium – has of course been used as a mordant in dyeing and fabric imprinting for millennia, but there’s a risk of leaving sulphuric acid behind that can (theoretically at any rate) create a ghost image if or when it chemically dehydrates the more superficial and sensitive linen carbohydrates, especially those in the primary cell wall, or maybe gum or starch adjuncts used to increase dye viscosity..","date":"2015-03-04","mins":"1:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/checking-in-on-colin-berry-a-new-image-model-forming-in-my-mind/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Checking In On Colin Berry:  A New Image Model  ‘forming in my mind’"},{"id":"comment-192363","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thank you for providing the links Dan, which I’ve quickly scanned.

I found that the radiocarbon sample was uniquely coated with a plant gum (probably gum Arabic), a hydrous aluminum oxide mordant (the aluminum found by Adler), and Madder root dye (alizarin and purpurin). Nothing similar exists on any other part of the Shroud.” https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers5faqs.pdf Is there anyone reading this who has access to that data and can provide a summary and/or link?

That’s why I prefer to focus on those unusual and enigmatic features that have managed to survive centuries of wear and tear – notably the approximate colour, the 3 D properties,maybe the absence of fluorescence (though that too may have been present initially). The new technology described here was well within the means of a medieval forger intent on simulating a sweat imprint, and what’s more gives an image with a degree of photographic fidelity, albeit of a somewhat non photogenic negative, but at least it responds to tone reversal and 3 D enhancement, as did the equally non photogenic TS image in Secondo Pia’s dark room.

It shows that the TS image was considered baffling and mysterious a mere 150 years or so after the first recorded public showing at Lirey. Looking then at the much earlier d’Arcis memorandum, a mere 30 years post Lirey display, and making the same two assumptions (i.e. Not necessarily accurate as regards content, but not a forgery or attempt to deceive or misrepresent either) then the TS image was also seen as baffling and mysterious in 1355 approx, or it would not have been able to attract pilgrims from far and wide, creating resentment in the bishop’s palace. So there are three main options to consider at the time of the Lirey display: a genuine 1300 year old relic, a fake imprint onto extant modern linen that indeed looked like a fake, or a fake that had been processed to make it look 1300 years older than its true age. How would/could the latter be achieved? Laundering would fade the image, especially if made originally from food ingredients like flour, egg yolk etc as per new kid on the block model. Boiling in oil would darken the linen, while possibly not affecting the image given it was already in a tan coloured HNO3 oxidized state, though blood is problematical, unless a heat stable blood substitute. I believe the Lalaing “legend” has a basis in fact, but not for the reasons Lalaing himself stated or even imagined.

That’s the flushed out, then gravity sedimented starch fraction in the glass dish on the right, also treated with nitric acid, with faint yellow coloration only. Why should wheat gluten (the protein fraction) of flour produce a orange colour with nitric acid? Answer: it’s almost certainly due to its high content of the phenolic amino acid tyrosine that readily nitrates with nitric acid in the so called xanthoproteic reaction (used as a test for proteins). In other words, the TS sepia colour is NOT due to dehydrated, oxidized carbohydrates, as suggested in the STURP summary.

I’ve just this minute added the following as a cautionary tale (please be assured it was not pre planned). Update: Sunday 29 June It’s said that one picture is worth a thousand words. On that basis, the blog posting so far should be worth 8 thousand words. Yet nothing could be further from the truth. To convey the truth where quicklime and its possible relevance (or lack thereof) to the Shroud of Turin is concerned, I would need a lot of words, maybe not 8000, but a lot. Why? Because I have (deliberately) committed the cardinal sin in science reporting by being highly selective so far in what I have chosen to report. Thus far, anyone looking at the pictures might think to themselves “Wow, that’s a lot of heat coming from that reaction between quicklime and water so much so that plastic pots are melting, linen is being scorched. OK, so there’s no image as yet, the starter experiment not being set up to produce an image, but the system clearly has great potential.” No it doesn’t. It’s actually of exceedingly limited potential. That I know already, not just from the highly localised nature of the scorching (reported) but from events (notably up and down thermometer readings) that preceded the spectacular meltdown of the plastic container. Nope, I haven’t been dishonest, just selective in the nature of my reporting, and later in the day I shall start to fill in the gaps, using up my quota of 8000 words to describe the profound limitations of the quicklime model, and why already I suspect it to be non starter. It’s to do primarily with the two physical states of water in this system (liquid or gaseous, hint hint). I see my little punt has been flagged up on shroudstory.com. No comments as yet, which is perhaps just as well. I’ll now do the decent thing and copy and paste what I’ve just added here. Moral: beware selective attention to particular details, indeed selective reporting in general. Trouble is, you don’t know when it’s being done (but with long exposure to gee whizz press announcements etc one can develop a nose for it.

As the temperature rises you get a rumbling sound, which is water in the immediate vicinity of the acid reaching boiling point and then cavitating. Those foolish enough to add water to conc H2 SO4 are in for a very dangerous surprise. The water, being less dense sits briefly on top, but then the heat of dilution at the interface causes instant boiling of the water, which then hurtles out of the container bring most of the contents with it. I would follow the same routine when diluting conc H Cl, conc HNO3 etc but the heat of dilution and smaller density difference makes the splatter scenario much less likely. Conc H2 SO4 has an exceptionally high affinity for water.

I chose a plastic container for the first experiment, not realizing how much heat is generated from the slaking of quicklime with water. There was an additional reason – I wanted to have the reaction contained in a plastic container, sealed so as to trap any heat with a PLASTIC lid that would allow me to melt holes through which to drip water, and a separate one for the thermometer. It was the base of the container that melted! Since last commenting here, and saying I had no success with the quicklime (at least where modelling the TS image is concerned) I’ve realized there is an obvious experiment that needs doing, admittedly a bit of a blunt instrument. It’s one where I make a layer of quicklime powder, then sprinkle the ‘right’ amount of water on top to create a hot bed, substituting for a Bunsen burner, then quickly place linen on top, then try to create an ‘impactograph’ by pressing in an appropriate template (maybe metal, maybe ceramic, maybe something organic to model a corpse).

One does not lightly stray into the area of motives, but it’s impossible not to do so when one sees the gross abuse of language that is implicit in the routine deployment of terminology like “crudestarch” or “starch fractions“. That is is blatant attempt to equate starch with reducing sugar, needed to prop up a particular hypothesis. But the alpha glucan chains of starch do not fall apart of their own accord to make sugars. The alpha (1,6) glycosidic linkages are strong. It needs hydrolytic enzymes like alpha amylase whose action I studied intensively for some 8 years to break down starch OR prolonged exposure to strong mineral acids. It is frankly appalling in my view that the Shroud literature to this day is cluttered up with the idea of self decomposing starch. It is impossible to avoid that question of motive, either on Rogers’ part while alive, or those of his fanatical disciples, who continue to promote something that is a complete fiction. Rogers produced no convicing evidence for the presence of a starch “impurity coating”, not did anyone else, and even if he had, that starch would behave as starch, NOT reducing sugar. Resort to terms like “crude starch” and “starch fractions” to mean reducing sugars that are not there is for this retired biochemist the last straw.

Why? Because the claims of reverse side imaging, excessive image contrast simply did not tally with experimental results, provided but observed sensible temperature control, brief contact time, moist underlays etc. The chief downside was that it needed a statue or bas relief, when a real person would have been preferable. The sea change in thinking came with the discovery of the Veronica like motif on the Machy mould above the word SUAIRE, suggesting that the “Shroud” had been modelled as a sweat imprint on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen. That was the signal to think in terms of a two stage process. First, find a proxy for body sweat (white flour paste!) that could be smeared on a real person, then imprinted onto linen. Second, develop that negative imprint in a way that produced a yellow brown colour. That proved possible, first with cold nitric acid, then with hot limewater, and then simply with a hot iron, presumably as a result of Maillard or caramelization chemistry. So while the initial scorch model was abandoned, there’s a sense in which I’ve returned to it, but with a major improvement. Direct scorching requires a higher temperature, with the risk of excessive scorching, whether that materialized or not with careful temperature control. In contrast, development of a flour imprint can be done with or without thermal treatment. If thermal, as with a hot iron, one can use a temperature, obtained by trial and error, that causes browning of a flour imprint with absolutely no risk whatsoever of scorching linen per se, certainly not on the non imprinted parts of the linen. I make no apology for abandoning the Mark 1 scorch model, ie. For changing my mind, switching horses, call it what you want. It’s in the nature of science to refine models and occasionally abandon them. The crucial point, as indicated, was to view the “Shroud” as a simulated sweat imprint. Did anyone suggest that previously, and say that the negative image was immediately accounted for? If they had, then I missed it. If one has to have one’s own eureka moment in order to explore a new line of investigation, then i would say there’s no shame in having previously pursued a different one, especially when one ends with what might be described as a scorch imprint Mk2 hypothesis, two stage rather than single stage, using a real person not a statue.

I believe it had a natural cause, maybe some type of sweat imprint.” But the hot template model is just a model, and models in science are to be used, not believed (I thank a Dutch economist for having come up with that handy truism). What that model did was to scotch any idea that 3 D properties were unique to the TS image, as some have claimed and/or still imply. It also showed that one could get quasi (pseudo?) bas relief imprints off fully 3 D templates, simply by imprinting off the highest relief only, avoiding the wrap around distortions that some say is inevitable (it’s not, as I showed with a brass crucifix). As I say, hot metal is just a model system, and if as I now believe, the aim was to SIMULATE a sweat imprint,accepting that sweat itself is probably impractical, despite the legend associated with the Veronica, then there there were numerous options open to a medieval artisan. Pure thermal energy (scorching of linen fibres) was just one. The scorching could have been assisted by pre coating with thermosensitizing agents (the “invisible ink” effect obtainable with milk, lemon juice etc) or maybe there was a combination of fine powder and accompanying acidic impurity, as suggested in Luigi Garlaschelli ‘s frottage model as the possible mechanism. But tlt’s not get too bogged down in the technical detail, none of which is likely to provide a proof (merely showing how an image might have been obtained with conventional physics and chemistry. The thesis being proposed is not only simple, namely that any representation of the purported “genuine” burial shroud that lwas a faint barely discernible NEGATIVE imprint, that could not easily dismissed as a mere painting, was bound to attract intense interest. One has to forget paint – it’s a total irrelevance that ignores decades of image research, and which fails to address the ICONIC nature of the TS image (a reasonable description I’d have said for both pro and anti authenticity schools of thought). I do not understand why Charles Freeman is having such difficulty with that proposition. The Veronica was regarded as a sweat imprint, So why can’t he accept that a faint negative imprint of the front and rear of a naked man, with additions of blood, maybe accrued over time, in all the biblically correct places, would have found immediate and probably uncritical acceptance by the majority of easily suggestible religious pilgrims (the more worldly wise Church authorities being another matter)?

All that matters is that it was claimed to be one, and folk could relate to that, so much so that more and more Veronica images appeared (wiki) that looked increasingly like bog standards paintings. Presumably they were explained away by the “sweat” having miraculous properties that allowed it to change into a fully pigmented portrait. Yes, the shroud was promoted as a burial cloth, not a veil. But one has to explain the NEGATIVE image. That implies a contact imprint. But from what, given it’s faint? The Machy mould for a Lirey badge variant with its Veronica image over SUAIRE must surely provide a strong clue to the image as having been created to SIMULATE sweat, regardless of how that was achieved, but no ordinary artist’s pigment could ever have been passed off as sweat. Thus the need to think like a medieval artisan as to how an ancient sweat stain could be simulated. I for one have barely scratched the surface where possible options are concerned. No, dead bodies don’t sweat. But that’s hardly the point. All the pilgrim was asked to believe was that a blood and sweat coated body was removed from a cross, and placed in a linen shroud without washing. Evaporation and time did the rest to leave a faint and allegedly 1300 year old image on linen on first public display at Lirey. The essence of this argument is that the first cohorts of viewers in the 1300s were not put off by the faintness of the body image, that being compensated to a large extent by what you describe as ‘over flagellation’. I see no grounds for accepting your claim that the image was highly prominent initially before your putative paint pigment fell off. There was no paint pigment. Quite what produced the faint yellow coloration is anyone’s guess. Degraded linen (STURP) seems as good an explanation as any. But it generally takes elevated temperature and/or harsh chemicals to permanently colour linen, without being subsequently bleached by exposure to light, oxygen etc. Some kind of Maillard reaction is a possibility.

Dr. Alan Adler was the only American on the Commission for the preservation of the Shroud appointed by Turin. He was able to examine the relic first hand on one occasion and was emphatic that the the body images were not made with any pigment. Together with Dr. John Heller he identified true blood components on the Shroud and found serum rings around the bloodstains. Both of them published their findings in peer reviewed journals, “Applied Optics” and “Canadian Society of Forensic Science Journal”. Hello again Louis. I’m unclear as to your mention of the herringbone weave, having proffered no opinions on that aspect re authenticity. There’s also the fact that my position on “sweat imprints” is less to do with pro versus anti authenticity, and more to do with the motivation of medieval artisans and their sponsors in producing the TS. Dr. Alan Adler. Again, his well known views re blood, bilirubin etc have been something I’ve addressed at length in the past, but are not terribly germane to the “sweat imprint” hypothesis, where the focus is primarily on the body image, at least initially. However, I’d make a couple of observations in passing. First, Adler and Heller did not see the Shroud with their own eyes before the STURP summary appeared in 1980 of thereabouts. He did finally get to see the TS much later when appointed to advise on conservation. But are you aware that his later comment son bilirubin were totally at odds with what he claimed earlier? Initially he had said that bililrubin was responsible for “permanent bright red colour of the Shroud blood” and that it helped explain the anomalous porphrin spectrum (with no direct evidence I might add). Yet In his conservation advice he changed his tune, stating then (correctly) that bilirubin was unstable to light and might indeed act to catalyse autoxidation and image degradation. Maybe by then he had picked up on the fact that bilirubin can generate the highly reactive and destructive singlet oxygen on irradiation with visible light (the blue component especially). But he failed to retract what he’s said earlier about “extraordinary” amounts of bilirubin being in Shroud blood, which frankly is a non starter, given centuries of exposure to light an oxygen. Yet one major figure in Shroudology continues to proselytize authenticity on the grounds that Adler’s entirely wrong headed bilirubin story was for him the clincher. I repeat: Adler was a porphyrin specialist. He was operating ‘out of area’ when attempting to implicate bilirubin in his pro authenticity narrative, and doing so with no hard analytical data, relying instead on uv/visible spectra – notoriously unreliable with  undefined biological specimens. I do not dispute your comment re Adler’s view on the body image not being based on applied pigment. It was Adler and Heller after all who provided some suggestive evidence that the image was degraded linen carbohydrates, based on reflectance spectra and bleaching with diimide. As for the final paragraph, I’d say simply this. The task of deciding whether something that is centuries old is real blood ornot, given the multiple changes it will have undergone, right down to iron oxide, and given the failure to apply the techniques that Ray Rogers had at his disposal, but were never applied to blood,notably pyrolysis mass spectrometry, is far harder than most folk imagine. It’s also a little odd don’t you think that a porphyrin specialist who finds an anomalous porphyrin spectrum should have adduced an interference from bilirubin when neither the porphyrin nor the bilirubin were isolated chromatographically and identified. I could have shown them how to do it, the methodology having been developed in collaboration with two colleagues (Don Ostrow and John Zarembo) in my very first published paper (1972). Time now to pick up on some earlier points made by Charles. I’m not sure he appreciates that light/dark reversed images are a lot more demanding on a medieval artist than mirror (left right reversed) images, especially as the TS image is famous for its non directional character, making it highly unlikely it would have been painted by an artist whose eye is trained to pick up directional light and the light/shade effects it creates. We shall see. I suspect I’m still shadow boxing, even now. Is that fair comment?.","date":"2014-11-08","mins":"3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/colin-berry-wants-feedback/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Wants Feedback"},{"id":"comment-169890","author":"colin_berry","post":"“Colin – what is the problem in creating as negative image? The artis T of the Shroud as well as the Besancon shroud, was commissioned to imagine an image that a dead body might have left. The conventional iconography of the side wound is on the right side of the body, so he produced it on the left. Not difficult.” Can we forget about the blood for now please Charles, which I have repeatedly said is not the prime reason for the Shroud’s “iconic” nature, that being due to the unique collection of characteristics that describe the body image? The blood could well be paint, or some kind of blood substitute. I refer specifically to the double body image, its faintness, the largely uniform colour (Halta Definizione image excluded) the lack of directionality, the superficiality, the negative character (and more importantly the stunning effect of reversing the image Secondo Pia style , despite its faintness,) the 3 D enhancibility, again in spite of its faintness etc. You have picked just one item out of that list – the negative image – and basically said “so what?”.. That’s despite that list not including the pecullarities at the image at the microscopic level – the extreme superficiality, the half tone effect, striation patterns, “second face” etc etc. So what? Some of us have spent years now in trying to explain and understand how a faint image, one that we’re told is virtually indistinguishable from background when viewed at close quarters, can come to have all those weird and wonderful properties. You may be able to find other negative images in art galleries, but are they on linen as a portrayal of the recently dead Jesus in an up and over burial Shroud, and done so expertly as to cause major consternation when first put on display? The TS should not be regarded as a standard image produced purely by application of paint when there are no traces of any recognizable paint, and when there are so many disparate features that simply cannot be explained as the image having once been paint. To ascribe all those multiple anomalies to flaked off paint is not just a cop out. It’s frankly an insult to the intelligence of your readers. (So there). But I for one have moved on from firing broadsides at your thesis, necessary though they are. What I seek is informed criticism (or support) for my hypothesis that the TS image was designed as a SIMULATED sweat imprint, with no particular technology in mind just yet. Is there a fallacy in my reasoning that can be more constructively expressed than I simply don’t understand medieval art history? I say the TS (excluding blood stains) is a one off image that cannot be accommodated into Western art history – any more than Stonehenge can be accommodated into the history of Western architecture. I say the TS body image is more to do with technology than with art, executed expertly and covertly with a canny perception of what would appeal enormously to the curiosity of the 14th century mindset..","date":"2014-11-08","mins":"12:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/colin-berry-wants-feedback/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Wants Feedback"},{"id":"comment-169914","author":"colin_berry","post":"If one is asking whether the TS was painted free hand with classical pigment, or whether a mysterious technology was used instead, then I frankly fail to see what’s the relevance of your point re “brief flurry” Charles.

It was that brief flurry that led to the minting of a medallion, which would not have come cheap and which no doubt helped to set the local bishop on the warpath, especially if the Machy mould Mk2 version was ever produced with the addition of that Veronica image implying a common pedigree.

You betcha. Take this passage from the wiki entry on that “Veil of Veronica”. I consider it tells one essentially not only HOW the TS may have been made (as a simulated sweat imprint) but WHY it was made ( as a ONE OFF) to represent a bigger and better version of the Veronica, which in the 14th century was allegedly the “central icon” of the “Roman Church” according to Neil Mac Gregor (celebrated art historian/Director of the BM).. My bolding: “The final form of the Western legend recounts that Saint Veronica from Jerusalem encountered Jesus along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin sudor) off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by the Sixth Station of the Stations of the Cross. According to some versions, Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor Tiberius and the veil possesses miraculous properties, being able to quench thirst, cure blindness, and sometimes even raise the dead. The story is not recorded in its present form until the Middle Ages and for this reason, is unlikely to be historical.Rather, its origins are more likely to be found in the story of the image of Jesus associated with the Eastern Church known as the Mandylion or Image of Edessa, coupled with the desire of the faithful be able to see the face of their Redeemer. During the fourteenth century it became a central icon in the Western Church – in the words of art historian Neil Macgregor – “From [the 14th Century] on, wherever the Roman Church went, the Veronica would go with it.” I’m frankly amazed that Charles makes no reference to the Veronica in his ‘History Today’ article. Context is everything where the TS , notably where its sudden dramatic appearance in the mid 14th century is concerned, marked by the minting of the Lirey Pilgrim’s Medallion no less. How can a historian so lightly dismiss the TS’s instant celebrity, and the details that appear on that badge (like the inset image of what clearly is the Veronica above the word SUAIRE (sweat imprinted face cloth) – arguably an attempt to forge a common lineage between the Shroud and the Veronica – BOTH sweat imprints.

The double image was needed make clear to all but the dimmest that it was not just a painting of a man on linen. It was the IMPRINT left by a man on an up and over burial shroud. It was to be seen as the actual imprint, not just an artistic representation. Thus the gore too. Nudity? That’s an interesting one. I would suggest that once the decision was made to simulate a sweat imprint then that strategy imposes its own discipline.You can’t have a loin cloth since that would require some kind of discontinuity with the sweat imprint (weakened or reinforced?) and even if you tried to explain away some contrived anomaly in the midriff image as due to an otherwise invisible loin cloth, folk would have asked what kind of prudishness requires that a dead man be interred with a loin cloth still present.

I refer to the Machy mould, an admirable description of which, nay two, appeared in the BSTS Newsletters by HWMNBN (initials IW actually). As I’ve said earlier in this thread, there’s an addition to the engraving of the mould for Lirey badge Mk2 (or was it Mark 0 – see IW?) in the form of a Christ like face above the word SUAIRE. I take that to be a representation of the Veronica, and an attempt to establish a kinship between the Shroud and an earlier artefact that was perceived as a sweat imprint (whether it was or not is an entirely different issue). You refer to a “remote village” in Northern France, yet the de Vergy/de Charny home base considered it important enough to have at least one medal struck, possibly two, and to add BOTH their coats of arms, which heraldic specialists say is unusual.

Enough of that. I prefer energetically relevant physics and chemistry – the kind that won’t have Faraday spinning in his grave. This morning I tried a different approach, which I have just reported on my own site. Here is a photograph of the result: selective scorching of a superficial one cell thick layer A sheet of epidermal cells, with their cellulosic/hemicelluosic primary cell wall (PCW) just one cell thick from the inner scale leaf of an onion was dried overnight. It was then briefly “branded” with a hot metal template (a pencil sharpener) producing an intense scorch mark. The underlying linen was largely unaffected, except for a couple of point locations, one of them corresponding with a protruding screw head on the template. In fact, the minor marks on the linen probably represent baked on onion epidermis, being at least partially strippable with adhesive tape. When the still hot template was parked to one side (bottom of picture) it produced a second scorch on the linen, with that central screw head again being imaged. There is nothing remotely surprising about this result – namely that one can get selective scorching of a superficial cell layer by BRIEF application of a hot template. Alternatively,one could have used a cooler template, and either applied more pressure, or prolonged the time of contact or both. With three variables to play with, one could produce an image that was at the limit of visibility. I would fully expect that image to be confined to the primary cell wall – intrinsic to flax cells, or as here an “imported” sheet of cells with their PCW. I believe this result to be fully consistent with the thermal scorching/hemicellulose/PCW theory for Shroud image formation. In fact it was predicted by that theory, which must surely lend further credibility to it.

Not so. One chooses threads that are visibly coloured with the naked eye, and then seeks out that colour under the microscope. There are plenty of unscorched threads nearby to be certain that one is not mistaking unscorched for scorched fibres through being poorly illuminated. I’m also working with double illumination (light from above and below the microscope stage). The point needs reiterating that when one has hit on a means of producing a faint and subtle scorch that matches the macroscopic aspects of the Shroud, it then becomes more difficult to study at the microscopic level, simply because of the lower density of pigmentation. But in modelling terms, that’s a small price to pay for macroscopic authenticity!.","date":"2013-11-21","mins":"6:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/21/colins-scorch-under-a-microscope/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin’s Scorch Under a Microscope"},{"id":"comment-52281","author":"colin_berry","post":"Yes, that’s a good one to try.

I have seen your new pictures on your blog. Much better. Try again to use your camera (at the beginning, it’s difficult) but it is the only way to obtain HD pictures of a larger area (low magnification). This is the only way to see the color pattern at thread level on some adjacent (weft and warp) threads. In your new experiment, I see that some areas (like the torso) are more colored (brownish) than other areas (the arm); It would be very interesting to compare them this way. And to compare with the ME pictures. And to look at the superficiality in you new model. And … If you can’t obtain those pictures, ‘ll try to do that, following your new technique. Thank you for the appreciative comment, Thibault. Yes. Superficiality is probably the next big test. Curiously, one could probably learn more in a day or two of well provisioned research on thermal scorches than the sum total of hard information about the Shroud’s superficial image, based as it is mainly on that one sticky tape pull est. An obvious first experiment would be to take serial imprints of a hot template as it cools down, and monitor the surface changes physically and chemically to the point where the image is no longer visible. My guess is that superficiality, whether restricted to the PCW or with some involvement of the SCW too (with its matrix of hemicelluloses around the resistant cellulose fibres) is not an exotic issue at all. It probably takes relatively little browning of carbohydrates by chemical dehydration to become quickly apparent as a surface yellowing or browning, possibly at the tens or low hundreds of nm level. If nothing else, model studies with hot templates etc could help to develop specialized know how for characterizing the Shroud image (though I’m naturally more interested in ticking all the boxes on the scientific characteristics of the TS image – a credible explanation – not necessarily a complete facsimile.Then I can go back to studying Stonehenge and Silbury Hill. ; ) I’ll persevere a bit longer with the microscopy, but it’s not really my forte, especially as the hobbyist’s microscope is too powerful, at least when linked up to the laptop.

In that photo shown, one thumb and the angle it makes with the adjacent forefinger is used pincer like to get a grip on the other thumb and hey presto one then sees fingers only on the imprint. But you’re quite right – that thumb to thumb lock is too low to match the “Shroud” image. Well spotted, and a portion of humble pie will accompany breakfast this morning. But it’s a detail that is easily rectified. The pincer thumb can be used to grip round the wrist of the other hand, i.e. Higher up (which makes for a better match with the TS). The pincer thumb disappears from sight in the subsequent imprinting. The other thumb, or the tip thereof, is still visible, but with a live volunteer one simply instructs him to move it out of sight, under the palm, by contracting the appropriate set of muscles. Drat: that introduces a qualifying assumption into the model, i.e. That an arbitrary decision has been taken that was not needed in the discredited thumb/thumb configuration required merely for grip. It can be defended, I hazard to suggest, on artistic grounds – that the strategic withdrawal to a thumb/wrist configuration leaves part of a thumb visible as a stump that looks untidy on the imprint, so one politely asks the volunteer to tuck it out of sight. Personally. I have a low tolerance threshold for qualifying assumptions in other people’s models, like the dozen or so (conservative estimate) needed for a certain well known rival model to work, the one needing clothes pegs on the nose when attempts were made by a certain BSTS newsletter editor to reproduce it in a school laboratory out of term time, as happened a year or so ago.

It began with Joe Accetta’s abstract for the St.Louis conference, suggesting that medieval oak gall ink had been used for imprinting, i.e. A liquid medium that I and others had previously ruled out on the grounds of capillary spread. He added two extra ideas that warranted attention, first that something else was added to increase viscosity, and second that there may have been a mordant added to improve fixation. Not having oak galls to hand, I chose another source of tannins, namely pomegranate rind, extracting into hot water to get a yellow dye. So at this point, yes, there was “just another way of making linen turn yellow”. But it didn’t stop there. I tried adding gum arabic (mentioned by JA) but the increased viscosity did not significantly reduce capillary migration. I then thought about dye mordants, and added alum, which made the pomegranate go green, but that was all. I then wondered about the long term action of alum mordant in cloth due to a well known effect of its hydrolysis to sulphuric acid, there being plenty of suggestions in the literature that the “Shroud” image was the result of acid etching by H2 SO4 (Nickell, Garlaschelli, STURP 1981 Summary, Hugh Farey). So that was the cue for looking at the effect of sulphuric acid directly, adding battery acid to linen and allowing it to evaporate and become more concentrated. Finally there was a faint brown discoloration, but it needed heat to make it a credible etching agent for leaving images. But there is another common mineral acid, one that stains skin yellow – nitric acid. So that was tested on linen, producing a light tan aged effect that looked promising. What was the nitric acid reacting with? Maybe traces of protein, via the well known xanthoproteic reaction that is responsible for the yellow colour of nitric acid stains on skin. That was the cue to coat linen with extraneous sources of protein – milk, egg white, gelatine, white flour etc etc. Pure starch was no good. That’s when two unexpected advantage of white flour were spotted,one, its particulate nature –whole plant cells – gives it an immediate advantage over soluble dyes remaining behind the migrating water vehicle, helping rehabilitate wet imprinting technology, and two: its adhesive properties either as cold dispersion or hot gelatinized paste proved a bonus when imprinting off skin, helping linen stick under light pressure. Further testing showed that the nitric acid was reacting with the gluten (protein) of the white flour. Might there be a simpler way of developing a white flour imprint? Flour has protein and much else besides – reducing sugars etc. Maillard reaction? That was the cue to apply a hot iron to the white flour imprints, or simply place in the oven. Either method works, making the imprints first turn yellow, then brown. One finally had a credible means of imprinting off a human subject with a harmless paste, with convenient adhesive properties, and then developing the yellow colour by the simple application of heat to get a presumed Maillard reaction at temperatures below those needed to scorch linen. It’s taken some 3 months of experimentation to reach this present point, some of it involving work with messy dyes and highly corrosive acids. All of it was initiated by cues and clues from the existing science re wet imprinting, noting its pros and cons, and attempting to refine the wet imprinting model. I now discover from reading Heller’s book that fellow STURP team member Sam Pellicori was not only thinking in terms of wet imprinting but attempting to model sweat imprints (my idea, or so I thought!) too, but without the benefit of additions to improve viscosity and/or stickiness. Somehow Sam Pellicori’s work got overlooked and forgotten, and here I am 37 years down the line reviving that highly promising line of investigation (which TH must surely have known about, seeing he too has read John Heller). To say that I am disappointed by Thibault’s comment, one that frankly trivializes the science, mine and that of Pellicori, Accetta, Garlaschelli etc in the most cursory and dismissive of terms would be an understatement.

In three separate experiments, he had placed oil, lemon juice and perspiration on his fingers. Then he placed linen on top of his hand and pressed it gently to his flesh. He then placed the cloth samples in an oven at low temperature to produce an accelerated aging effect. In each case there was indeed a yellowing of the contact area. He had brought the linen samples with him. The team examined them and, although there was a surface effect, several of us insisted that we could see some capillarity in several of the fibrils, which is not the case of the Shroud.” Note it was capillarity that was the concern – not something as mundane as having the right look or colour. They can change with age. Capillary spread, lacking in the Shroud image, constitutes a far better criterion where liquid based models are concerned. One wonders if Pellicori experimented with viscosity increasing agents, as did Joe Accetta later, or whether he got disheartened by the negative feedback from those who forgot, if only momentarily, that preliminary models exist to be refined. At least he was spared being told “Oh, stop wasting our time Sam. There are lots of ways you can get a yellow colour on linen. Yours is just one of them”. Lucky Sam. Would that I were so fortunate… Model building is clearly something that should be left to scientists. We need no reminding of its limitations. It’s our stock in trade. Our brief is to focus on something that transcends the details. Our quest is to understand a new and possibly previously unrecognized effect or phenomenon that the model might be revealing, one that may well be obscured initially by background “noise”. I suspect that we scientists – real ones – the model building variety – have a greater tolerance for low signal to noise ratio than most. We have to – or nothing new and original would ever be discovered. Isolating an initially feeble signal from the noise is the name of the game. Enhancing the signal, eliminating the noise, is downstream R/D, and can often be left to those whose bent is more towards technology than science..","date":"2015-08-07","mins":"5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/06/comparing-colin-berrys-methods-to-those-of-sam-pellicori/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comparing Colin Berry’s Methods to Those of Sam Pellicori"},{"id":"comment-207730","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks Angel.

Yes, models can be the means by which one rids oneself of unhelpful ideas too – one’s own or other people’s. Models are a ‘coping mechanism’ in a situation which Donald Rumfeld summed up beautifully – “We do not know what we do not know”. Incidentally, I’m not trying to prove the Shroud body image is a fake (blood will have to take its place in the queue) merely that it does not require unknown science to model it. A model based on a bag of white flour and a hot iron has surely to be more credible than one based on late 20th/early 21st century lasers producing coherent uv light that may not (and probably does not) exist anywhere else in the Universe, unless we are not alone.

The right way is to incorporate a small benchmark into one’s test image that has no 3 D history, and to avoid using the z (height) control if at all possible. Image J has a non zero default setting that elicits a small 3 D response in one’s benchmark (not everyone knows that, despite it being visible from the initial position of the pointer on the numbered scale).

In three separate experiments, he had placed oil, lemon juice and perspiration on his fingers. Then he placed linen on top of his hand and pressed it gently to his flesh. He then placed the cloth samples in an oven at low temperature to produce an accelerated aging effect. In each case there was indeed a yellowing of the contact area. He had brought the linen samples with him. The team examined them and, although there was a surface effect, several of us insisted that we could see some capillarity in several of the fibrils, which is not the case of the Shroud.” I wish I’d known about it early 2012 : ( I wish someone on this site had flagged it up : ( Here’s a link to my very first hypothesis (thermostencilling), posted just one week after starting in Jan 2012, which suggested lemon juice and starch/sugars as sensitizing agents in a thermal imprinting model, though without suggesting them as a proxy for sweat (not entering this senescent head till SUAIRE was spotted on the Machy mould two years later). Http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/shroud of turin was lightly roasted.html Sadly it suggested mummified monks, as in the Brno monastery, as a possible template in order to achieve the ‘bony’ look to fingers etc, instantly attracting the scorn of a certain archaeosteganocrypto wotsit who never misses an opportunity to remind me of those ‘thinking out the box’ semi skeletal mummies. Now if someone had mentioned Pellicori and his “lemon juice” , dismissed by sceptical STURP colleagues as posing a problem as regards capillary spread, I’d probably not have bothered with dry imprinting (scorch hypothesis) and instead looked for ways round the capillarity problem (viscous additives etc). Who knows – a certain scientifically challenged loose cannon of a historian might have been stopped in his tracks if the Pelilcori contact imprinting approach had gained traction or been resurrected sooner. Instead it had to wait till late 2014 (Joe Accetta, St.Louis) to see attempts to breathe life back into the suspended animation wet imprinting model.

How did the image get there? Pellicori exercises scientific caution in answering that question. The team (ed. STURP) is not to make its conclusions public for a year. By then more study will have been done, possibly including carbon 14 analysis that could date the shroud. Pellicori said there were currently two hypotheses. One is that the image is the result of chemical reactions of the cloth and some bodily emanation. The second more metaphysical theory is that it was caused by a “sudden burst of energy from the body”. He would not say whether the analysis indicted (sic) if stains on the shroud actually are bloodstains as some believe. Pellicori himself is not a religious person. His interest in the shroud is scientific he said. For Pellicori, though, it would be nearly impossible to “prove” that the shroud is what it is purported to be. “All you have is circumstantial evidence at this point, and maybe that’s all we’ll ever have.” Suppose his modelling with persiration, oil and lemon juice had closely matched the “Shroud”body image? Does anyone here seriously believe that he would have immediately trumpeted that as evidence for authenticity? The tone of the article suggests otherwise, As an emotionally detached and conscientious scientist, he would have proceeded to set up two hypotheses – one based on authenticity, the other based on medieval forgery.

February 5, 2013 at 4:34 am | #7 What’s your current preferred theory Hugh? Is it the scorch theory? although I see some good points in Colin’s ideas, there are a few things that still trouble me about the scorch theory, including: – the general anatomical correctness of the image: statues of the 1300s were still struggling with anatomy Some say the head is too small! Yup. I think it looks too small. As for those fingers, their length and skeletal quality… – certain characteristics of the image – eg. The rear foot sole imprints – very much appear as genuine organic images from a real body, rather than images generated from a bas relief template or equivalent I agree. The images are indistinct, but the little we see has an authentic look, so that indistinctness is only to be expected if, say, the linen had been pulled up against the underside of the feet. They definitely speak of a statue rather than (easier) bas relief. It’s possible I suppose that there was cannibalisation of separate templates – some bas relief, say for the head, some statue – for the limbs say. – the “wrist problem” – why the blood on the wrist when this was basically unknown in artistic depictions. Surely the wound would have been placed on the hand. But that does not gel with the Shroud having been on display centuries before its showing at Lirey, to the extent that “poker holes” are said to be incorporated into the Pray Codex (not that I believe that for one moment). Surely the wrist wound(s) would have been incorporated too, and then appeared much earlier in Western art if the Shroud had been around as the authoritative guide. Or there again, maybe the wrist wound was painted on afterwards by an overzealous 16th century(?)monk, but lacking in anatomical knowledge, and mistaking metacarpals for phalanges. – the general appearance of wounds across the body appear quite authentic to my eyes, rather than something ‘faked’ There are no wounds on the Shroud body image. Bloodstains, yes, but no wounds. – why the absence of loin cloth, again a historical norm. A fake created by scorching on a bas relief could have built in a loin cloth into the relief. Again why the big departure from the cultural norms of the time? Because the crossed hands serve the same modesty protecting function as a loin cloth? And crossed hands are surely more authentic in the context of being enshrouded in an enclosed tomb, away from casual observers and/or inquisitive eyes. PS: Here’s Hugh’s response, which appeared after I posted the above: February 5, 2013 at 6:34 am | #8 Hi Matthias; the shroud is such a varied topic that I don’t have any theory encapsulating the entire thing. I’m mostly exploring the scorch idea for three reasons: a) Several of the original papers by the STURP team describe the shroud as having many of the characteristics of a scorch, in particular the relationship between pressure or distance and image intensity and the fact that the image seems to be made of degraded cellulose. B) Scorching linen and observing the results is something anybody can do in their kitchen! c) Although degrading cellulose by scorching may not be the answer, experiments with superficiality, 3 D imaging and UV fluorescence may suggest a mechanism that can be achieved in other ways (gas diffusion or painting, for example). All the difficulties you mention are entirely valid, and were the main reasons the STURP team rejected the hypothesis, but they are, for time being, outside my purlieu, as it were!.","date":"2013-02-05","mins":"8:56 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/could-this-be-clinching-evidence-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-contact-scorch/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Could this be clinching evidence that the Shroud image is a contact scorch?"},{"id":"comment-1814","author":"colin_berry","post":"2nd para’ (See response to introductory para below) “These transverse creases are very different from the “V shaped” fold running vertically all along the center line of the fabric. “its (sic )existence points to the fact that the cloth, in order to protect its precious content, has been folded length wise with the image facing in, apparently from a very early point in time”.

I’m delighted to see that you have restored your Mobylette time machine to full working order, Thibault, and are able to enlighten us on the entire history of the Shroud from the date of its inception. However, I have to take issue with you on some ever so tiny details. That might take some time, given the number of details you have raised, and the fact that I am now becoming increasingly bored, not so much with the Shroud, as to the tactics of Shroudologists, and am more concerned right now with finalising my (damning) critique of Oppenheimer’s book on the genetic origins of les rosbifs. Here, by way of a courtesy, is my immediate response to your first point. You say “dozens of transverse creases”. I don’t know which creases you are referring to, but what seems abundantly clear from the Durante 2002/Shroud Scope image of the transverse crease at chin level is that we are seeing a feature that has essentially the same character and homogeneity as the body image. In other words, it is not just a crease, but a baked in crease, something you overlooked to mention (odd for someone who is so attentive to detail). (Late edit: I shall post details tomorrow of what provisionally one might call Type A and Type B transverse markings). Now that baked in crease might in theory have arrived with the 1532 fire. But you say the crease is the result of “rolling” for storage. Are you not forgetting something? The bilateral symmetry of the 1532 scorch marks indicates without a shadow of doubt that the Shroud had been folded down its midline – between the eyes so to speak – at the time of the 1532 fire. Quite how could it have been folded down its long axis AND a number of transverse axes (again, symmetry) – AND rolled up all at the same time to give a multitude of baked in creases is a difficult concept for me to grasp. I suppose it’s just possible there had been rolling as well as folding. Perhaps you could supply some diagrams to back up your theory. In the meantime, I work on the assumption that the baked in creases were acquired at the time that the Shroud image was imprinted, especially as there is one at chin level, and another at the top of the head (best seen in Enrie negatives) , suggestive of imprinting when a rigid hot template was forced down into linen. There are other details I could mention, like the twin track appearance of the crease, tricky perhaps to explain as simple folding, but possible by the kind of invagination that might occur when the linen is subject to deformation from a rigid template under applied pressure exposing it to complex forces, especially when there is a soft backing underlay that allows a lot of movement. Invagination creates cold spots – or cold linear furrows – able to escape scorching, as I proposed many moons ago. “This crease has nothing to do with the image formation process.” Sorry, Thibault, but critics who indulge in that kind of dogmatic assertion are not ones I hasten to respond to. You may have to wait a while for answers to the rest of your points..","date":"2013-02-02","mins":"8:30 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/could-this-be-clinching-evidence-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-contact-scorch/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Could this be clinching evidence that the Shroud image is a contact scorch?"},{"id":"comment-1815","author":"colin_berry","post":"Paragraph 3: “Much more interesting is the discovery of another almost invisible fold, called by FL the “primary fold”.

How can a feature that has precisely the same hue as the body image, yet largely obliterates any superimposed body image due to having that pale central zone between the twin tracks, be described as “false”? “Regarding B and C, I see no problem at all with any kind of non contact process.” You don’t see any problem with there being no known radiation capable of scorching linen at a distance, while still leaving an imprint of undamaged hair? “This kind of process may or may not leave an image between the chin and the chest.

In fact the margins are not sufficiently linear to lend much support to yarn variability as the major cause for the abrupt cut off of the face at the two lateral margins. The high degree of bilateral symmetry also makes it improbable that banding is the major reason for the severe and, some might say, unrealistic mask like character of that face. If it were not for the photogenic enhancement that comes with turning the pseudo negative into a positive, I doubt whether the TS would exert the hold it does on so many folk – given its luminous and haunting character.

What the ‘radiationists’ seem to be doing, if I’m not mistaken, is to adduce imprinting of the neck etc across an air gap in a loosely draped model, as evidence for action at a distance – despite the subjective model, and, more importantly, in clear contradiction to elementary physics (no chemical change without prior absorption of radiation). They then compound the felony by invoking the inverse square law. The latter only tells you that the flux density falls off (dramatically) with distance, but that is irrelevant if it’s the wrong type of radiation (or target, in this case linen) that is unable to absorb sufficient radiation to be altered by it to leave a “burned patch” ( leaving a recognizable image adds another order of complexity, even in 21st century ENSA laboratories far removed in time and space from 1st century rock tombs, one that is usually glossed over if mentioned at all).

Ray Rogers BS, MS was a competent and resourceful explosives chemist (most of the time). But I have to say (candidly) with no disrespect that he might have benefited from doing a Ph D training program(me). There is no better training for a research career than acquiring the habit of writing every paper as if it were a doctoral thesis, and that one’s life (or 3 to 4 years thereof) depended on it. That means imagining that one is to be grilled line by line as if in a viva voce exam by an external examiner who is highly knowledgeable in one’s field. There is scarcely a scrap of real evidence, certainly not experimental evidence, in favour of the Rogers’ hypothesis. That’s unless one counts a somewhat inclusive starch test (but meaning what, since intact starch is not a reducing sugar, as required for a Maillard reaction?). Let’s not beat about the bush: The Saponaria suggestion was pure speculation, with Rogers expecting the reader to take for granted his assumption that the linen had been made exactly as described by Pliny.

It’s not rocket science. You make two classes of yellow brown pigments – one with a Maillard reaction between known sugars and known amines, and the other by pyrolysis/caramelisation reactions with carbohydrates alone. You then compare the two classes in their response to a range of chemicals, e.g. Hydrogen peroxide, diimide etc, or behaviour on electrophoresis (do they migrate to the positive or negative electrode?) – or ion exchange resins etc. Having established one or more tests that distinguish between the two classes (which should not be an insuperable task, given the major effect of having an organic base present or absent) you then see how the Shroud image behaves in that discriminating test. Based on the number of factors that would have to coincide for Rogers’ hypothesis to work, I’d estimate the chances of the Shroud image being a Maillard reaction product at about 1% of less. In fact, I’ll make a prediction. The nitrogen content of an image area per mg of organic carbon will be no higher than that of non image area (a Maillard reaction requiring nitrogen in the form of protein or simple amines). I see no a priori reasons for giving the Rogers’ hypothesis equal footing with that of chemical change not needing an external source of nitrogen or reducing sugar.

I’ve just this minute resurrected my sciencebuzz site to provide an hypothesis that folk won’t have read elsewhere. Update: 22 April: Here’s a summary of my ‘nitrous oxide’ hunch that I have submitted to New Scientist: Letter to New Scientist sent 21 April 2013 04 21 “So what caused the devastation at the Texas fertilizer plant? Ignoring the initial reports that it was simple combustion of anhydrous ammonia (highly improbable except at elevated temperature or with oxygen enrichment) the later implication of large stocks of ammonium nitrate (said to be as great as 270 tonnes!) did not make a lot of sense either. That would surely have left a huge crater had even a fraction decomposed explosively and caused devastation on an even wider scale. The key feature surely is the video footage that shows a sudden conflagration with flames soaring up hundreds of feet – a fireball in other words. That speaks of rapid combustion rather than a classical explosion resulting from detonation and instant decomposition. Is there a mechanism by which that could have occurred, involving ammonia and/or ammonium nitrate? I believe there is, based on the following equation: 2 NH3 + 3 N2 O > 4 N2 + 3 H2 O (+ heat and light energy) ammonia gas + nitrous oxide – > nitrogen + steam The ammonia gas was stored on site as the liquid under pressure. Any rupture of the tanks by fire would have produced an abundance of ammonia gas. The nitrous oxide, N2 O, aka laughing gas? N2 O, a powerful oxidant, roughly comparable to molecular oxygen (both relight a glowing splint) is formed when ammonium nitrate is decomposed by heat: NH4 NO3(solid) > N2 O(gas) + 2 H2 O In other words, both the ammonia AND the ammonium nitrate were involved. Ammonia was the fuel, and nitrous oxide was the prime oxidant. The above mechanism might explain why the tragedy was not made worse by release of unburnt ammonia fumes, a deadly asphyxiating agent (paralyses respiratory muscles), given the reaction products are innocuous nitrogen and water vapour only. Chemistry aside, whose bright idea was it to store tons of ammonium nitrate so close to human settlement?

My modern linen samples have threads that act like blotting paper towards water, and, surprisingly, oil as well, whether wax coated or not (medievals would not have cared either way) but the individual fibres, while quickly adsorbing ink to become coloured on their surface, do not take up water or oil into their central cores, so there’s still some model development to be done. My preoccupation at present is the claim, nay ‘received wisdom’, that the image layer on the TS is (a) a highly superficial layer on fibres and (b) approx 200nm thick. The first seems based on little more than anecdotal evidence, much of it straining credulity, especially when based on viewing an assortment of ‘mechanically damaged’ fibres under the microscope. The second seems to be complete fiction. As far as one can tell there has been no systematic study to establish the location of image or coloration in either the TS or (laser generated) model systems respectively, and certainly no data that would justify the bandying around of that 200nm figure either as if hard fact.

Http://forums.philosophyforums.com/threads/the shroud of turin is it just all in our minds 73055.html#lastpost It explains the rationale for imprinting with flour, as a proxy for sweat, as per the Francis de Sales interpretation of the Shroud body image, 1614. There is a simple reason why there is no unanimous consensus on the so called Shroud, despite (or because of) the radiocarbon dating. That’s because modern science has been supplied with no clues as to how the ‘relic’ was produced (materials, source of energy etc). Inconvenient though that is, it’s hardly surprising, is it, since the entire point of forging the ‘genuine’ articlewould have been to make it seem a one off. So one cannot even have pilot R/D versions lying around, or the merest whisper as to how the result was achieved? The starting point for science must surely be to get right what the intention of a 14th century forger was. Don’t at any costs buy into the pro authenticity narrative that it was a burial shroud. That’s the thin edge of the wedge for tacking on a miraculous resurrection narrative (flashes of scorching uv radiation etc, which frankly defy conventional physics). A more probable explanation is that a forger wanted to re create a body imprint of Jesus left in blood AND sweat on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen en route from cross to tomb (that fabric being replaced at the tomb by the more specialized burial wrappings hinted at in the Gospel according to St.John). In fact there’s the testimony of St.Francis de Sales, writing to his mother in 1614, for which a cut and paste seems legitimate, given the difficulty in accessing the original source: Note the numerous references to SWEAT: Annecy, May 4, 1614. Whilst waiting to seeing you, my very dear Mother, my soul greets yours with a thousand greetings. May God fill your whole soul with the life and death of His Son Our Lord ! At about this time, a year ago, I was in Turin, and, whilst displaying the Holy Shroud to such a great crowd of people, a few drops of sweat fell from my face on to this Holy Shroud itself. Whereupon, our heart made this wish : May it please You, Saviour of my life, to mingle my unworthy sweat with Yours, and let my blood, my life, my affections merge with the merits of Your sacred sweat ! My very dear Mother, the Prince Cardinal was somewhat annoyed that my sweat dripped onto the Holy Shroud of my Saviour ; but it came to my heart to tell him that Our Lord was not so delicate, and that He only shed His sweat and His blood for them to be mingled with ours, in order to give us the price of eternal life. And so, may our sighs be joined with His, so that they may ascend in an odour of sweetness before the Eternal Father. But what am I going to recall ? I saw that when my brothers were ill in their childhood, my mother would make them sleep in a shirt of my father’s, saying that the sweat of fathers was salutary for children. Oh, may our heart sleep, on this holy day, in the Shroud of our divine Father, wrapped in His sweat and in His blood ; and there, may it be, as if at the very death of this divine Saviour, buried in the sepulchre, with a constant resolution to remain always dead to itself until it rises again to eternal glory. We are buried, says the Apostle, with Jesus Christ in death here below, so that we may no more live according to the old life, but according to the new. Amen. Francis Bishop of Geneva. May 4, 1614. (Oeuvres complètes, édition d’Annecy, 1910, t. XVI, p. 177). So one has a handle so to speak: ask oneself how a medieval artisan might have tried to simulate/mimic a sweat imprint, probably using materials and conditions that don’t require real sweat. E.g. Organic based substitutes, probably heat assisted. Try to model that process (as this investigator has done by use of white flour as imprinting agent, followed by light oven roasting). See my two most recent postings: shroudofturinwithoutallthe…mbra flour scientist says/ colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot…er beam really needed.html Then, when an opportunity arises (if ever) for a second visit to Turin with hi tech equipment ,the first by the STURP ensemble being 37 years ago, look for chemical signatures of one’s final short list of possible or likely modelling techniques. Less of the defeatism please… Where there’s a will there’s a way. There’s a scant record of the early history of the so called Shroud. The least that Shroud so called historians can do is to recognize its existence, to address it, discuss it, and then, and only then dismiss it if they see fit.

The initial claim for ultra superficiality (“200nm”) simply because the coloration was uv induced was a total nonsense, as anyone who knows the first thing about suntans would have told them (melanocytes and their melanin respond to uv light despite having a proteinaceous keratin layer of at least 0.05mm on top – that’s 50 micrometres, or 50,000 nanometres – 250 times their “200nm” PCW thickness. Even if the uv had acted in the most superficial 200nm layer, a free radical mechanism that is common in photochemistry could have resulted in propagation and chemical knock on effects at a much greater depth.

The Shroud, which has been specially brought from Chambéry, with great ceremony, by Duke Philibert of Savoy and Duchess Marguerite, is exposed on an altar in one of the great halls of the Duke’s palace. Savoy courtier Antoine de Lalaing records of the events of that day: “The day of the great and holy Friday, the Passion was preached in Monsignor’s chapel by his confessor, the duke and duchess attending. Then they went with great devotion to the market halls of the town, where a great number of people heard the Passion preached by a Cordeilier. After that three bishops showed to the public the Holy Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and after the service it was shown in Monsignor’s chapel.” Lalaing adds that the Shroud’s authenticity has been confirmed by its having been tried by fire, boiled in oil, laundered many times ‘but it was not possible to efface or remove the imprint and image.’ Nobody subjects an image to that kind of treatment, whether actually carried out or not, if there’s the slightest suspicion that it’s “just a painting”. However, it’s arguably what might be done, or suggested tongue in cheek might have been done, in the case of a mysterious and enigmatic image that is totally unlike a conventional painting. My flour imprinting model actually incorporates the kind of treatment alluded to above, namely a final vigorous washing step with soap and water to remove the encrusted Maillard product, leaving a ‘ghost image’, one that is faint, fuzzy and Shroud like (negative image, 3 D properties).

Why it’s a negative image – it’s a contact imprint 2.

Why it has 3 D properties. Contact imprints off 3 D subjects – in this instance a real person, probably live volunteer – typically have 3 D properties. 4. Why there is no paint pigment – it’s a simulated sweat imprint obtained by thermochemical reaction on the surface of the linen fibres. 5. Why STURP found evidence for the presence of real blood, albeit somewhat degraded, the latter having been used to make the strategically sited bloodstains. 6. The fuzziness of the image – solid flour particles used for imprinting onto wet linen. 7. The spectral characteristics of dehydrated carbohydrates, the model envisaging any number of ways in which the carbohydrates of flour, linen or both can become thermally altered at the oven roasting stage (Maillard reactions with protein and/or simpler amines, caramelization etc). 8.The ability to chemically bleach the image, indicative of organic (NOT inorganic) nature, i.e. Carbon, not mineral based as per typical artists’ pigments – iron ochre etc. 9. The reported brittleness of image fibres, compared with non image fibres. The fibres in direct contact with the flour imprinting would be more thermally degraded and chemically modified. 10. Microscopic properties (half tone effect, discontinuities, striations etc), that may ultimately be interpretable in terms of limited areas of hot spot contact between linen fibres and thermally degrading imprinting medium. 11. Image superficiality: the roasting step can be controlled visually, allowing any desired degree of image intensity, with the added guarantee that the final washing step with soap and water will attenuate image intensity and image thickness still further. 12. Alleged traces of starch: this is only to be expected of using flour as imprinting medium. 13. No imaging of the wound sites per se – merely blood. A simulated sweat imprint would not capture an image of damaged skin if the latter were exuding blood. Even the “scourge marks” are said to be entirely blood, not imprints of body image. 14. Minimal lateral distortion, despite being a contact imprint. The imprinting medium can be applied to selected relief, e.g. The highest, the flattest, avoiding the vertical sides. Manual pressure to linen is also restricted to the highest, flattest relief, avoiding the sides. 15. No loin cloth, no crown of thorns – they would not register well in a simulated sweat imprint, even if still present.

It then moved to looking at sulphuric acid per se, and finding its etching action was insufficient to produce discoloration.

I would also suggest folk here read Mario Latendresse’s introduction to those curiously symmetrical sedillis marks on the “butts”. Http://www.sindonology.org/papers/blood Marks Butts.shtml They should then ask who is pushing the agenda, which while not a full blown conspiracy theory displays arguably some of its elements, like an attempt to demonize those who question what to them is received wisdom (or in the case of the Shroud, holy writ despite being curiously overlooked in the New Testament account of events between the crucifixion and resurrection). Folk may also notice that I did not attack Mario for expressing his opinion, despite disliking the partisan introduction. I addressed the facts regarding those markings, and proposed an alternative explanation for those who, like myself, had never even heard of those sedillis. And doubt whether they were precisely as described by Mario anyway. It’s disappointing to say the least that my proposals are not being judged on their practical merits or otherwise, but are being summarily written off as another “a strange hybrid method”, and placed alongside an equally grotesque description of Russell’s analytical approach to the events of ’63. It is lesser men and women, aping Russell’s style, who created the conspiracy theory industry, mainly in the USA I hasten to add, in which every tiny detail, significant or otherwise, is mustered to assemble a damning indictment. Whilst not having read Russell’s thesis, I strongly suspect there was anything there that was trivia dressed up as crucial evidence. And why the reference to science? Russell was not a scientist, and never to the best of my knowledge claimed to be one. He was a philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, social activist and lots of other things besides. So why the crass reference to a hybrid of “science and literary genre”. Is that code for an atheist who expressed himself well? Is he seen in some quarters as an early prototype for the demonic Richard Dawkins, also an atheist who expresses himself well. Oooh look, they are both Brits !!!!! That means we can say what we really think (in code of course).

But there’s a bigger issue at stake here, namely that I have been drip feeding detailed scientific proposals to this site for some weeks now, making points that no one before has made, and what do I get for my trouble? I get an invidious comparison with Bertrand Russell, who was himself also being hung out to dry in the US press by a journalist with the intellect of a tadpole.

Those who think I have judged Dan Porter too harshly should look at the dumb conclusion from that dud journalist to which he has given pride of place: “…this strange hybrid method, through which a literary genre convinces itself it is a science.” I hold no special brief for Russell, neither his brand of philosophy nor his politics, but I can tell you this. If that statement above had appeared in a UK newspaper, i would be seriously considered a formal letter to our Press Complaints Commission, stating that it totally misrepresented and defamed the memory of one of Britain’s most able thinkers (and that’s without the ludicrous claim that Russell was the father of modern day conspiracy theories – quite the most repugnant and pig ignorant journalism I’ve encountered in quite a while. . ).

Now turn that around and one can say that wherever there’s a wound site, visible or otherwise, there’s a blood trail. But that’s not the case where your sedillis is concerned. There is NO blood trail, merely a reddish or brown circle that may or may not be blood (Yannick thinks they are burns, not blood, judging he says by colour).

My position since early 2014 could not be simpler to articulate|: the TS was a medieval project that set out to simulate/model/re enact/fabricate/fake what a sweat/blood imprint left on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen en route from cross to tomb might look like some 1300 or more years later. It had to be an IMPRINT, and instantly recognizable as such. Thus the (hey, guess what ?) – ‘imprinted” look, what today we call a negative image, but there was a belt and braces approach to leave no one in any doubt whatsoever as to the mechanism by which the image was acquired – by contact imprinting – NOT oh so unimaginative painting that would not have stood up to a few seconds of close examination. The clincher? The double body image, frontal v dorsal, aligned head to head with a small distance between the two. That screams IMPRINT! The so called wounds? They don’t exist, contrary to a host of sindonologists. There are blood stains instead, proxies for wounds, at strategically sited locations that correspond with the biblical account, but our modellers realized, even if some modern day experts do not, that a contact imprint from a man with open wounds does not obligatorily require imaging of torn or piunctured skin if there’s to be blood there instead. Put another way, a sweat imprint cannot be expected to compete and leave its signature if there’s blood at that location too. Back now to my own site, where I am planning a riposte to the claim that I am seeing two slim fibres with an intervening gap, not the single fibre I confidently claim with thermochemically produced yellow or brown pigment seemingly inside the cylinder, This investigator is far from infallible, but does not make elementary errors, as some here would have other site visitors believe.

Folk may be wondering how I intend to shoot down that ‘two fibres instead of one’ claim. Here’s a starter image: https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/twin11.png?w=640&h=236 It’s a single thread that has been teased out of the weave from linen that has been thermo imprinted with flour. The fibre was chosen because it had a pale brown colour. Under the microscope on my intermediate magnification (x10 objective) you can see why it’s brown if you look at the underside of that curve. It’s due to individual fibres that look brown against a black background (the latter being the chosen and achieved by top illumination only). Already one should be able to see that the brown is the core colour of fibres by comparing with the size of the detached fibres. The idea that the brown is “background colour” between threads is frankly a non starter – the regular geometry and spacing alone between those brown strands should dispel that notion immediately. But we shan’t stop there. The next step is to take a pair of needles and tease out the separate fibres from that thread, with a view to showing that each individual fibre has a brown core (or as I suspect, outer core) that is inside an uncoloured outer layer. The hypothesis under test is that the outermlost PCW is NOT the recipient of the image colour. The recipient is directly underneath in the S1 layer, with a lacy network (?) of lignin being the real chromophore. Fun, isn’t it? No?

Has no one else spotted it? Clue: look for the blue. Then google “optical brighteners” , as in modern linen, and the different ways in which the brightening effect can be achieved. Then look again at both my pictures, even the low contrast one, and tell me that my microscope lacks resolving power (revealing as it does the internal architecture of a linen fibre that has been “histologically stained” for a commercial reason that has nothing to do with the furtherance of botanical science). On a different matter please see the valuable observations posted above by Hugh Farey at 5:13. While the Heller/Adler protease experiment is interesting, it’s worth consulting Heller’s book, page 203, to see why and how it was done. Why? It was driven by polemical considerations, wishing to dismiss any idea that the TS image was merely a painting (yes, one small paragraph only being considered necessary!). So the test was not designed as a rigorous one, merely a quickie probe. Had it been rigorous, there would have needed to be pre selection of one or more image fibres, assessed by some technique that could detect image colour below the ‘serum’ overlay. Instead, fibres were taken from “Image areas”, without any specific reference to the halftone effect and/or discontinuities. In other words, one has no guarantee that a serum coated fibre from an “image area” is an image bearing fibre. Indeed it is just as likely to be a non image one. The identification as an image fibre came AFTER the protease digestion, judged on that corroded surface, as Hugh mentions. That’s not a lot to go on, given the importance that is attached to this single ‘demonstration’ of the blood first image second dogma. Back in 2012, when first being made aware of Shroud Scope (needing a nudge from Mario L himself on this site) I looked closely at blood stains where the shape and colour intensity suggested that parts had flaked off. There were no compelling grounds for thinking there was white space underneath – quite the contrary in fact with hints at least of image continuity, as if the image had been imprinted first. No, it was not conclusive evidence, as was pointed out, and no the technique of eyeballing the Durante images from Shroud Scope is not cutting edge science. But neither was the much hailed over hyped Adler/Heller experiment, the trophy result, the ‘jewel in the pro authenticity crown’. But this investigator is not trying to disprove authenticity, merely to rise to Di Lazzaro’s challenge to reproduce the general look and properties of the TS with known science (but maybe with hitherto unknown or forgotten/secret technology), requiring no mysterious energy inputs. To that end I have now made a personal decision to view the TS image as having an image first blood second chronology, unless or until hard evidence to the contrary can be supplied. Indeed, I shan’t be researching the blood issue, it not as far as I’m aware having been described as an “enigmatic” property of the TS, apart from the difficulty posed by the allegedly blood first mantra. Back now to my not so hopelessly inadequate microscope to look at single teased out fibres. They have their own drawbacks, btw, given the lack of internal reference points for comparison that means one has to be very, very wary in one’s interpretation. Single fibre study is no panacea, no open sesame.

In most instances, at least with flour/hot oven imprinting, the images are clearly visible on removal from oven (indeed they stay in the oven until the ARE easily visible) It’s only after the final attenuation stage, when the image can be exceedingly faint (as per TS!) that one resorts to added contrast, but purely as a visual aid. If I weren’t reporting to my blog I’d probably not bothering capturing the high contrast image for posterity, or even for next week’s Recycle Bin. I’d simply do some simple checks to ensure that one is not viewing or creating artefacts. One way is to move the contrast slide control in my MS Office Picture Manager from 0 100 (usually with adjustements to brightness and midtone value) to ensure that no new features are appearing or disappearing (I cannot recall a single instance in which that has happened – the contrast acting merely to reinforce what is already visible). The second way is to compare the high contrast image with the original straight from oven image prior to washing. They usually resemble each other very closely. In other words the final attenuation step needed to “match” the faint and ghostly TS is one that DELIBERATELY reduces contrast, so there’s a sense in which, if careful, one is fully entitled to restore it electronically, if only to ensure that the attenuation step has not created artefacts that others might discover and publish by playing with their contrast settings! I’m about to report results with an oil only imprinting procedure that shows promise of explaining a neglected aspect of the TS body image, namely coloration in the crossover junctions as well as the celebrated crown threads. We may be seeing evidence of a hypothetical flour imprinting medium being supplemented with exogenous oil ( e.g by smearing oil on the skin before dusting with flour). There the contrast control becomes virtually obligatory in the absence of flour to check the capabilities of oil on its own. I’ve even resorted to using a home made orange oil (tomatoes being a handy source of oil soluble lycopene – a member of the carotenoid family, C40 H56).

It’s because science is primarily about ideas, with facts being secondary, that science is so easily subverted. Read “pseudoscience”. The crucial difference between science and pseudoscience is that ideas in science are put to experimental test, so as to establish certain facts, and if found wanting the ideas are quickly modified or discarded. (Think of it as mental spring cleaning). .One rarely if ever knows the entire facts that have a bearing on a case (thus the difference with a court of law that deals entirely with the existing facts). Science can get things entirely wrong, but unlike pseudoscience, it has an ongoing process that can lead to a changing of mind, discarding previous conclusions.

The first was to see what kind of imprint was obtained if the ‘Galaxy Warrior’ was entirely coated in the round with oil/flour, and imprinted in a single session to get both frontal (LOTTO and dorsal (LUWU) images. Would there be lateral distortion in the two images, due to excessive wrap around effect? Answer: NO, I am pleased to say, which did not come as a surprise in practical terms, but did from theoretical considerations, until that is I put pencil to paper. Yes, there will be a small diversion into geometry and trigonometry to explain why there was no noticeable lateral distortion. The reason is quite subtle. That’s two of the three jobs. The third job was to explore the consequences of imprinting from a small terra cotta head I had fashioned from modelling clay, later oven baked and painted, which initially had a prominent nose. (The nose and face have always been the greatest challenge in the contact imprinting model of the TS). Yes, the nose did interfere with imprinting, producing some odd effects due to creasing of the fabric.. I then took a close look at the TS face image in 3 D, and decided to take drastic action. That prominent nose on the terra cotta template has now been filed down to a less prominent feature, and will be retested tomorrow. While the nose is less prominent on the template I see no reason why it should be less prominent on the imprint, still producing I predict a 3 D enhancement in Image J. But then the nose of the TS does NOT respond well in Image J either. Go figure as they say. The so called wrap around/lateral distortion objection to contact imprinting is turning out to be largely a fiction. I hope to provide convincing explanations as to why, in both mechanical and mathematical terms. Clue: our bilateral symmetry about our long axis means that each longitudinal half of the torso with arm and leg has a mirror image, i.e. Opposite half, that acts as a projecting brace/cantilever, one that greatly restricts the wrap around effect when the body (or effigy thereof) is enveloped in a large single sheet of linen and VERTICAL pressure then applied..","date":"2016-01-11","mins":"9:51 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/heres-how-a-medieval-entrepreneur-could-have-produced-the-iconic-two-fold-image-on-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"contact_imprint","title":"Here’s how a medieval entrepreneur could have produced the iconic two-fold image on the Turin Shroud."},{"id":"comment-6719","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks.

That means having the figure lying horizontal, either with linen underneath, and then applying force from above onto the figure OR draping the linen on top, then pressing down onto the linen. I used both those modes to get the latest imprint. Getting the frontal and dorsal images correctly spaced and aligned was not difficult. One simply irons in two creases along both axes, meeting at the centre of the cloth, and uses the point where they meet as a reference (frontal and dorsal head spaced the same distance from the intersection). I’m re reading an early Jackson paper from 1989 right now. Leaving aside his OTT ‘collapsing cloth’ ideas, it’s interesting to see him describe the dorsal side as a contact image, due to ‘discontinuities’ around the shoulders and buttocks, while invoking imaging across air gaps for the frontal side.

Accordingly, I regret to say I’m not 100% certain what was in my mind when I wrote those words. However, I suspect it was a reference to the image that followed next, i.e. Third in the sequence. That was a close up of the face, and there one could see the same distinctive rosy coloration that was so prominent a feature of the chest and shoulders in the first two pictures. Without the evidence from the face (cheeks and chin especially) the rosy coloration in those first two pictures alone might have been imagined or assumed to be blood from scourge marks. Since there is no blood on the cheeks or chin, and no scourge marks on the face, it can reasonably be concluded that the rosy regions represent something else. Which I believe from the pattern of their distribution to be areas of highest 3 D relief. Opinions will differ as to why they imprint most strongly, but I’m sure you’ll be familiar by now with my belief that they imprinted most strongly due to highest contact pressure between ‘subject’ (whether or not a real person) and linen. Incidentally, I reported (among other things) in a new posting afternoon a novel scorch image obtained with a hot metal template that has fuzzy edge, dare one say TS like.How was it obtained? Simple: I brushed plain white flour into the linen before imprinting. No doubt that image is heterogeneous too – a mix of linen pyrolysis products and flour derived melanoidins, with the first of those tending to correspond perhaps with the highest relief of one’s template.

That might be true at the millimetre level, inasmuch as it is the exposed crowns of the threads lying slightly proud of the surface that are preferentially scorched (almost impossible to explain in any radiation model). But it is not true at the gross level if a deliberate attempt had been made to stamp a hot 3 D replica into linen in such a way as to get maximal contact between metal and cloth (e.g, by pressing into a bed of sand to push cloth up against every relief feature of the replica, including the more deeply recessed ones like eye sockets) So when you talk about burnoff in a radius about points of direct contact, can we be clear about one thing.? It is burnoff on a sub millimetre level, enough to encircle a fibre, but not enough to move very far along the axis of the fibre. To quote Fanti et al : “The extinction distance of the colour along a fibre is of the order of 0.1mm”. Fanti et al(2010) Yup, just 0.1 mm, which may be an impressive 500 times the image thickness (200nm), but is only one third the thickness of the fabric (0.3mm). So you must dispense with any idea that those tenuous microfibrils of hemicellulose igniting (well, pyrolysing to be more accurate) at the microscopic level means that they fizz along macroscopic lengths of fibre, enlarging and indeed wrecking the image. They don’t, since they meet obstructions, like the ends of those elongated tracheid cell walls. At best they break up sharp image outlines, making them look slightly more soft focus (especially when processed with 20th century photography), and making the image look less like it had been branded on by a cowhand.

Provided one conducts the branding operation at a temperature that one knows (through careful monitoring with test strips of linen) will produce no more than a light scorch, then the pyrolysis will be confined to that superficial layer. That highly selective scorching is a reflection of two complementary and accidental factors that work in the forger’s favour. The first is botanical structure, with the most vulnerable hemicellulose being in the PCW on the outside of each fibre – and secondly chemical, or rather thermochemical, i.e. The tendency of hemicellulose to “ignite” so to speak at light scorch temperatures and to continue pyrolysing to completion until ALL the hemicellulose in that region or pocket of a fibre has been used up. It is that “all or nothing” effect, at the level of INDIVIDUAL fibres, centred on crown fibres that lie slightly proud of the surface and the first to make physical contact with hot metal – that can explain the curious half tone effect, regardless of whether the scorch is faint or a bit more prominent, as already discussed.

Had the blood been present on the cloth during application of the heated template this would have lead to its thermal degradation, at least to a point where this would be detectable through microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. No such decomposition has been found, apart from the areas damaged by the 1532 fire and a number of other post image formation incidents. Accepting this, the only possibilities left are that the template was cut to ‘skirt’ any areas where the blood would be later applied. Alternatively, after application of the blood to the cloth, perhaps this was shielded, using some technique, from the heat of the bas relief. For either option though , you have to ask why on earth would a medieval forger do such a thing when he can far more easily imprint the image and then overlay the blood. He gains absolutely nothing by complicating things in this way. Certainly, his intended victims would not know the difference. Coupling this with the anatomically correct antemortem and postmortem blood flows with discolorations and the high bilirubin content due to trauma, you’d have to say it is very unlikely that a forger could have just trickled blood to the appropriate parts of the cloth. Why would he bother go to these lengths since as we know medical knowledge was very limited at the time? You say “no such decompoisition has been found”. The blood is so extensively degraded, whether by time, heat or other means, that there have been serious doubts raised as to whether it really is blood – something I personally would not want to get into without seeing all the data. I have to say though I think you are a little careless with your words. Raymond Rogers, for example, made an exceedingly brief statement to the effect that the blood could not have been heated since it “did not evolve hydroxyproline on mild heating”. Given that hydroxyproline is a white crystalline amino acid with a high melting point as organic compounds go (274 degrees Celsius with decomposition) one would not expect it to be evolved by any kind of heating, mild or severe. The more I read about the blood tests, the more I feel as though I had stumbled into a strange territory far from the kind of biochemistry and clinical chemistry I acquired when I worked in hospitals and medical schools. I have yet to see any hard evidence that the blood contained any bilirubin at all, far less the vast amounts that were supposed to ‘neatly account’ for the bright red colour of supposedly aged “blood”, and supposedly a signature of massive haemolysis and jaundice occasioned by acute physical trauma.

The image IS a scorch, and one moreover produced by thermal degradation (pyrolysis). Pretty well all the evidence – physical and chemical points to that – its superficiality, its concentration on fibre crowns, its colour, the absence of any chemical residues, its mechanical weakening of the affected fibres, the ability to reproduce yellow or brown coloration at will with the simple application of modest heat, e.g. An electric iron, the ability to bleach with a powerful reducing agent (diimide). The only downside that I can see is the lack of fluorescence, but nobody checked that out when the image was new and fresh, as I discussed on my own site recently: Why it’s a scorch Yet those who reject any idea that the Shroud is a medieval fake tend also to react strongly against the description of the image as a scorch. Why is that? The answer is simple: by adopting that term they fear that a mundane connection will be made between the image and the most obvious means by which it would be produced in the medieval era – i.e. By direct contact with a hot template. We then see the absurdity of a group of scientists (who should know better) reeling of reasons as to why the image defies modern science, yet overlooking or downplaying the key signature of a contact scorch – namely preferential coloration of the crowns where one thread loops over another, with crowns then slightly proud of the surface, and thus the first to make contact with a hot object. I hesitate to say it, but those scientists – and many folk here, are quite simply IN DENIAL. If they cannot explain the selective scorching of crowns – as I can – then they should stop criticizing my use of the term “scorch”, and better still start to produce some good arguments AGAINST the image being a contact scorch. “Scorch” I would suggest is an empirical term meaning coloration produced by exposure to heat. How did Di Lazarro and colleagues imagine that any kind of radiation would be capable of selectively targeting the crowns at a distance? Even with their highly improbable (some might say comedic) high energy uv, the radiation would have to be in the plane of the cloth, just clipping the tops of the crowns. Here is a concluding comment from Fanti et al (2010): “The characteristics of superficiality described here in detail, coupled with other particular characteristics of the TS body image described elsewhere, could lead to a more reliable hypothesis of body image formation”. So here’s a retired science bod who is responding to that challenge. I have proposed an hypothesis that I believe accommodates, or has the potential to accommodate, most if not all the known attributes of the Shroud image (blood etc can wait for another day). What’s more it incorporates what I consider to be unique features, designed to address particular points or criteria, notably: 1. The presence of loosely packed fibrils of pyroloysis susceptible hemicellulose in the outermost primary cell wall, with no impairment of access by the kind of highly ordered arrays of cellulose fibrils that exist in the secondary cell wall. 2. The exothermic nature of hemicellulose pyrolysis (probably aided by limited oxidation and CO2 production) such that once initiated the hemicellulose reacts to completion, at least that which is immediately accessible. This either/or effect probably explains the curious half tone effect. 3. The restriction of pyrolysis to the primary cell wall could explain the 200nm superficiality of the scorched zone. 4. The selective scorching of crown threads, indeed a few surface fibres in those threads, is exactly what would be expected of scorching by close contact (no air gap) with a hot object. 5. The negative image is exactly what one would expect from a branding technology, i.e. Applying a heated template to a surface, with temperature chosen to produce a light and superficial scorch on linen. There would be left/right and light/dark reversal. Any image of a human face, thus produced, would look alien and unappealing until returned to a positive by modern photography. It is not good enough for ” passive spectator scientists” to say that it’s all been done before. No, the groundwork has been laid, and there have been promising lines of investigation, notably John Jackson’s with heated statues, but which in my view were prematurely abandoned, especially as Jackson showed that his scorched on image had “encoded 3 D information”. ANY scorch can be rendered in 3 D, by twiddling the different gain controls (which is NOT science, but a branch of applied mathematics – matrix transormation). And though i hesitate to say it, I think the time has come to say candidly to all those who jib at my term “scorch” and to dismiss “scorching by contact/heat conduction” as the most probable mechanism of image formation to be told in no uncertain terms that THEY ARE IN DENIAL. If they don’t like the hypothesis on offer, then there’s a simple remedy – suggest a better one (but make sure it’s a scientific one if you want the senescent ear of this old science bod)..","date":"2012-02-20","mins":"9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8523","author":"colin_berry","post":"Sorry about the blue.Seems I did not properly close an html tag on a link, which has failed to appear, and like everyone else, have no ability to edit, needless to say..","date":"2012-02-20","mins":"9:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8528","author":"colin_berry","post":"Ron, as I have said before, I don’t feel in the slightest bit obliged to produce a facsimile copy of the Turin Shroud, any more than I have to produce a facsimile copy of the Mona Lisa to prove it was painted with brush and oils.

Just because the hands and maybe (?) parts of the skull have an “x ray quality” does not mean they really are x rays. Why is the thumb not better visualised if an X ray, instead of being a vague blur that some folk rationalise as a retracted thumb? Why are the feet or other parts of the body with fairly superficial bones, e.g. The arms, not also possessed of an X ray quality? There are many possible explanations for those bony looking fingers. Each depends on the supposed mechanism of imaging. Until one has a supposed mechanism, it is pointless speculating, unless, that is, one thinks the phenomenon under investigation provides clues to mechanism. X rays as the source of imaging radiation? Not even those ENSA guys went into such high frequencies with their excimer lasers. How would those X rays be focused? And what would serve as X ray film? Plain old linen? Hospitals could save themselves a fortune by recycling old bed sheets… The simplest explanation for those fingers in terms of known physics is that a bas relief template had bony fingers, or – for those overlong fingers that the thermal imprinting process went awry, maybe as a result of slippage between cloth and heat retaining template to cause multiple overlapping imprints that simply registered as “too long”.

But there is one thing about which I am fairly confident, which is that whatever was used, it required thumping the object down into a bed of sand or similar in order to get a good thermal imprint. Since the hammering had to be done quickly, I would guess heavy tampers were used, say a trio of workers each with a heavy log. That’s assuming that the object had been heated to a modest temperature for light imprinting (testing beforehand with a scrap of linen) so as to be certain of producing a sepia tint than charcoal black image. The weight of the “body”, dare one say dead weight, is/was almost certainly irrelevant. If you try small scale modelling, as I have: thermal imprinting you will find that branding onto linen requires a considerable amount of applied pressure, over and above the weight of the body assuming, once again, that modest temperatures are used (to preclude any risk of burning a hole through expensive linen). But the replica then scorches only the crowns of the threads, which in fact is the crucial giveaway “signature” on the Shroud image, demonstrating beyond any reasonable shadow of doubt to my mind that it was produced as the result of contact/heat conduction, with no air gap, as distinct from electromagnetic radiation of any description at a distance, (Dr. Di Lazzaro et al please note)..","date":"2012-02-19","mins":"1:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"id":"comment-8700","author":"colin_berry","post":"Where on earth did you get that notion about “extreme penetration” Ron?

Whilst I have no means of ensuring that any visible scorch marks that I create on linen are of that thickness, and no more, I have reason to believe I am in the right ball park. Why? If one overlays a sheet of linen with a dried sheet of epidermis stripped from the scale leaf of an onion, which is just one cell thick (i.e. Two cell wall thicknesses plus intermediate cell contents) one can produce an intense scorch on that epidermis with virtually no effect on the underlying linen (except where a protruding screw head on the template broke through!): intense scorches can be highly superficial So forgive me if I am relaxed about dimensions at the cellular of subcellular level. When you have handled sheets of single plant cells, and find them as easy to deal with as thin tissue paper – then things suddenly acquire a different perspective. Scorches CAN be highly superficial. It is a matter of conjecture as to why, but it could be that the eye overestimates the extent to which a structure is damaged by a scorch. A faint visible coloration may simply require the introduction of relatively few chemical double bonds into the surface structure, sufficient to absorb a little incident blue light from the visible spectrum, scattering blue deficient light which our amazing eyes perceive as faint yellow or brown.

Scientific modelling requires an attention span of months, years even, not the minutes or at most hours we see on this site. Eliciting 3 D responses from 2 D images, many with no 3 D history, has been this blogger’s speciality, the subject of literally dozens of postings, which cannot be easily or quickly summarized here in just a few words. Any attempt to do that would lay one open to those looking to score points at one’s expense. However, I’d just say this about 3 D and image edges in the context of the flour imprinting model. 3 D effects are most realistic when there’s a smooth gradient in image intensity. A medieval modeller would not have known or cared about that, but might still have deployed a technique that unwittingly generated smooth gradients. Why? How? Maybe it was through trying to achieve that other criterion – the fuzzy edge – for that ghostly quality? How? Lay the subject flat and apply flour paste thickly to the highest contours of the body. Then take a second brush, maybe wetted with water, and spread the paste laterally to the sides of the body, with progressive thinning from centre to sides. That process is likely to generate the required gradients of image intensity, as well as ensuring a tapering off of image intensity to a fuzzy indistinct edge. Though reluctant to accept that the “fuzzy” edge is a scientific criterion worthy of a place on the enigmatic/iconic checklist, there is a possible scientific angle that springs to mind. Use of a wet flour paste means there is always an air/water meniscus at the edge which tends to result in excessive contrast. The way to avoid that is to deploy the flour as a solid. How? One way is to use it for Garlaschelli style frottage, sprinkling it on top of the linen (making no direct contact with body) and moulding to contours. Another way is to rub the flour onto the subject first, and then drape over a sheet of wet linen (with no continuous unbroken air/water meniscus) and proceed to mould to contours. Any meniscus is between single flour particle(s) and linen. Initial results with microscopy look promising, though the match has to be with how the “Shroud” image might have looked centuries ago, or with the Mark Evans pictures photo enhanced to improve contrast.

This might be a good moment to flag up a new concept that will be proposed – or as some might say, inflicted – on the body politic of sindonology, namely the ‘shelf effect’. Yesterday, following a stinging rebuke from a certain medical gentleman, I decided to move from a wet paste model to a dry powder one, conceived while grinding teeth in the wee small hours. The subject is first coated liberally with white flour, and then covered in wet linen to get the negative imprint. In this model, the best 3 D effect is not from the highest relief as might be predicted but from the flattest – the most shelf like. Result: a tendency for 3 D imaging to promote the level planes of presentation to linen over the vertical or angled ones, rather than – or in addition to – elevated over lower relief. Why? Because the flour sprinkled and spread out onto a flat shelf like area of the anatomy stays put, whereas flour applied to the vertical planes tends to quickly drop off under gravity. I believe the ‘shelf effect’ can explain some anomalies re the way the “Shroud” responds in 3 D rendering programs, notably Image J, including those bony fingers. It’s something I flagged up a while ago, having spotted a peculiar two tone colour distribution in the Halta image that appeared on the BBC site in 2010 (increased contrast in my photoediting program causing the ‘shelf like’ features of the anatomy to acquire an unexpected rosy hue). Oh, and I’m starting to think Hugh Farey was right at the tail end of 2012 regarding the chromophore. He suggested lignin, not carbohydrate as is generally presumed. The lignin of linen, while a minor component (3%) is said to be a lot more dispersed than might be assumed from comparison with the literature on wood.

But not really relevant to my own point. My point is that the resurrection is beyond physical laws, therefore the image was created in ways beyond our understanding of natural laws. So taking my point a step further, this will mean that if the shroud image was created by the resurrection then we will never no how the image was created because we will never be able to rationalise what or how the resurrection occurred. My belief – and it is only a mere belief! – is that Jesus’s body dematerialized, before rematerializing in spiritual form before the witnesses – and this is the resurrection. Now in the act of dematerializing, an image was formed on the Shroud. According to my belief, we’ll never be able to explain how this occurred. I don’t buy into the ‘resurrecton radiation” theory for example – it’s an example of trying to apply physical laws to a supernatural event. I realize scientists will find this all most unsatisfactory. And I am more than happy for a naturalistic theory to disprove what I’ve outlined above. It wouldn’t affect my faith. I have no problem with any of that, Matthias. My interest is not in debunking Christian belief, or, more hesitantly, with miraculous accounts of how the “real” burial Shroud came into being. My beef is with the scientists of questionable objectivity (I’m not allowed to call them pseudo scientists) who either claim that conventional science backs up the Shroud’s authenticity, or who attempt to blend science and magic to explain the Resurrection and image imprinting as a supernatural flash of radiation, and then rush to their excimer lasers, corona discharge generators, medical X rays etc etc in search of “supporting evidence”. If it’s any comfort (probably not), I too once wavered towards authenticity when reading the Sunday Times Magazine account of Rolfe’s Silent Witness, late 1970s.

First, as I expect you know, it requires a continuous expenditure of energy to maintain high K+/high Mg++ inside living metabolically active cells, and high Na+/high Ca++ outside. The ATP dependent ion pumps maintain that differential concentration which in turn creates the electrical PD across the cell membrane, needed for life processes. If blood leaves the bloodstream, then it becomes cut off from its source of glucose for glycolysis and ATP generation. When the ion pumps stop working, diffusion down concentration gradients takes place, so potassium leaks out, and sodium leaks in to take its place etc etc thus equalising concentrations inside and out. So one can be fairly certain that old blood would quickly result in a high K+ in surrounding plasma (or serum after clotting). The second argument is much simpler. If something has happened to compromise the integrity of the RBC membrane, such that there is haemolysis, i.e. Escape of soluble haemoglobin into the surrounding plasma/serum, then you can be virtually 100% certain that a tiny cation like potassium, even with its hydration shell, will exit along with a macromolecule like haemoglobin..","date":"2013-11-17","mins":"9:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.

My first solution was to imagine blood from curative medieval “bleeding” being placed in a woven bag, and extruded through the pores so as to strain off clots as they formed. It was then I remembered the other method of draining off some blood – using the medicinal leech. Semi digested blood, harvested from a leech, would not clot – since the first thing the leech does when sucking nblood is secrete a powerful anticoagulant – hirudin. So in answer to your question David – no, leech blood is not obligatory – just convenient in practice – but might in passing help explain some of those anomalies (absence of whole red cells, absence of potassium, the allegedly permanent red colour of the blood, the atypical porphyrin spectrum, the hydroxyproline marker for collagen etc)..","date":"2013-11-17","mins":"10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.

In fact the experiment was prompted by this comment from David Goulet: “If anyone is doing another heated statue experiment, I’d be interested in seeing the result when using a statue with a minimum of three levels of contact – approximating the three levels of the body in the Shroud (top hand, bottom hand, lower trunk). Spatulas and coins are a good start but an object with more detailed 3 D would be very helpful.” That’s when I remembered having bought a brass crucifix a year ago, with some challenging in the round 3 D that I had not got round to testing thinking it would be a “difficult” subject. It wasn’t actually, though I found I needed to use lots of backing cloth and a club hammer to press down into those accommodating and yielding layers. I’m sorry the dorsal image could be mistaken for Superman, but when you come to think of it …oh, never mind… Those with simplistic ideas about blood/image relationships might do well to ponder on the implications of Alan Adler’s claim for some bloodstains being out of stereoregister with body image (thus blood rivulets on “hair” for example) and if thinking his orthogonally projected radiation is nonsensical, then what price the alternative of orthogonally projected ammonia molecules needed in a more ‘naturalistic’ Rogers’ scenario? I personally dismiss both radiation and ammonia, but that leaves a lot of other possibilities open to experimentation and hypothesis testing, shrugging off the dogmatists who say I’m wasting my time. It’s my time to waste – not theirs.

I did try addressing the details of “blood” specifically to start with, but found my current thinking re “Mode 1” v “Mode 2” behaviour, as seen in the yo yo behaviour of a certain contributor to this site (who shall remain anonymous) had produced a crystallization, so to speak, of a growing hunch as to the reasons for the derailment of Sindonology as a branch of science (as distinct from theology). So strap yourself in, take a deep breath, here we go. There are two ways in which a research project like STURP could have been set up, what I now call Mode 1 and Mode 2. Mode 1 makes no assumptions whatsoever about “authenticity”. Indeed, in an ideal world, one would have given the Shroud, or samples thereof to a group of scientists in a non Judaeo Christian part of the world, say Shinto Japanese, and asked them to collect as much information as possible, stating only that there may be human material on the fabric, and that the combination may be very old, possibly centuries. Then there’s the opposite approach, which I call Mode 2, which at its most extreme is to assume the Shroud’s authenticity, and to regard the project as an opportunity to learn as much as possible about the Jewish founder of Christianity from the remnants on the cloth. In that scenario, anything anomalous, far from being seen as a challenge to authenticity, is regarded as a (heaven sent?) opportunity to distinguish between an ordinary man and an extraordinary one. In Mode 2, no finding is allowed to challenge authenticity. Any and all findings must be interpreted so as to fit the narrative. Sadly with STURP one sees a initial attempt to operate in Mode 1 in the collection of data, but then a rapid recourse to Mode 2 when anomalies are encountered. One sees commendable Mode 1 behaviour with Raymond N. Rogers in the way he initially designed his sticky tape samplers to apply even pressure to the Shroud, and his description of the coloured coating on image fibres, and its retention as “ghosts” in the adhesive when the fibre is pulled out from the adhesive. But as soon as Rogers alluded to Pliny and ancient linen manufacture, imputing that thin image layer of linen fibres was starch and/or saponins, and making no systematic attempt to prove the presence of an even receptive starch or saponins (far less show how it could act as reducing sugar in Maillard chemistry without extensive degradation) he was moving from Mode 1 to Mode 2 behaviour, and forfeiting his claim to scientific objectivity. No “non Christian” group, before or after 1988, would have had grounds to suspect that the linen was 2000 years old, far less that it had origins in Palestine. The same can be said for Alan D Adler. He too wasted little time in making the switch from Mode 1 to Mode 2 behaviour. He noted the absence of red blood cells in the stains, but the presence of red pigment with some but not all the spectral properties of oxidized and degraded haemoglobin. He immediately tried to fit that to the biblical narrative, killing two stones if you like, resurrecting previous “narrative friendly” claims that the stains were not whole blood imprints (difficult to explain) but a serum exudates from blood clots (which conveniently gets round problems of chronology due to clotting and wet imprinting). Then, to dispel any lingering doubts as to his abandonment of scientific objectivity, he hit on the idea that the atypical spectrum was due to an “extraordinary” amount of bilirubin that had been produced in response to the trauma of crucifixion, and even that the oxidized haem was also an exotic species, unknown it seems to anyone but Alan D Adler, also a response to trauma. How much bilirubin precisely? An “extraordinary” amount. How measured? Apparently from spectral (dubiously specific uv fluorescence) and chemical properties (non specific diazo reactivity) properties, but with no attempt to isolate and fingerprint the bilirubin molecule (which is notoriously unstable in ordinary daylight – and it’s nothing to do with ultraviolet as commonly imagined, but the blue component of the visible spectrum). So if you ask, very properly and scientifically what is the status of the blood studies on the Shroud, one has to go back through those paragraphs above, strip out the Mode 2 narrative embellishing material until you are back to core Mode 1 science. The first task is to have made available, free of charge, all published material on the STURP findings to accredited researchers, indeed preferably anyone and everyone, but one has to start somewhere in disentangling Mode 1 fact from the Mode 2 narrative friendly fancy, The entanglement should never have happened in the first place, needless to say. There was a clear failure of management at the very top. Having said that, I have no issue with the STURP summary. It was the later researches and publishing of personal memoirs that led to the increasing blurring of the distinction between science and Christian theology..","date":"2013-11-18","mins":"4:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.

There was some 3 D enhancement of the Shroud image, as expected, but of rather inferior quality. So I decided to do it the other way round – to optimize on the Shroud image and then apply those settings to the crucifix scorch. The result came as a pleasant surprise – the 3 D enhanced images were virtually identical to the ones displayed above. In other words, there’s no reason for thinking that the characteristics of the model scorch are qualitatively different from those of the Shroud. The next thing to do will be to repeat the exercise on the frontal images of both Shroud and crucifix, which will be a lot more demanding an exercise, given the high relief on the brass which will make it virtually impossible to capture all the detail.

Didn’t Thibault show that a contact scorch like this just doesn’t have the same microscopic properties as the Shroud. As for the 3 D, it looks to me like the crease in the fabric resulting from the heat has given rise to much of the 3 D you can see there. Also, there’s far more of the image missing compared to the Shroud. I’d also like to see how superficial those feet scorches are. Do you have any microscopic images Colin? Hugh, am I right in recalling you dismissed the scorch theory not long back. If so, does this experiment convince you otherwise? Chris: I am still trying to determine precisely what these microscopic properties are that one is supposed to be reproducing. So far, it seems to be the half tone effect that is meant, which simply means a mix of fibres with either a particular hue and intensity of yellow or white uncoloured with no in betweens. But how much of that is a direct result of imprinting, and how much a result of subsequent ageing, with a few surviving weakly pigmented fibres? It may sound like a cop out, and Thibault seemed to indicate as much yesterday, but age and deterioration are the one certainty we have in this world of ours. The physicists call it entropy, and it’s a vastly important concept (like the driving force for ALL chemical reactions). I’m sorry that it’s not easily testable, if at all, but that’s the nature of the problem – we are dealing with an exceedingly old piece of fabric, but one thing seems fairly obvious – the image seen in the 15th century, say, was a lot more intense than the one we see today, or it would surely not have attracted hundreds, thousands of viewers, many of whom died in a crush I believe on one occasion. As for the entire thing being a result of creasing, all I can say is this. Press a hot template into fabric, and do the same to a sheet of smooth white paper alongside. You will get the same 3 D enhancement in either. Creases play little or no part when one is dealing with scorch images, even the faintest. Yes, there is image missing, because of flexure at the knees. But I was not attempting to imprint everything – merely trying to see what would imprint by pressing down into an underlay of cloth. Next week, I shall reverse the geometry and try imprinting from above with a tamper to get as much of the template in contact with fabric. The advantage of the new heavy brass template is that it holds its heat for much longer than previous smaller templates. The image of the feet is not superficial, because I was holding the cloth manually against the soles for some time. However, I am presently starting to look in detail at the whole issue of superficiality, especially the reverse side scorching that is said to exclude contact scorching from “relevant science”. Some of my fainter images from the crucifix show essentially no reverse side scorching, and when they do, the coloration is confined to the deeper parts of the weave, with crown threads unaffected. It maybe that imprinting with fabric on top, allowing pyrolysis gases to escape more easily into the air, combined with damp tamping, could greatly reduce the “inadmissible” reverse side scorching, especially as one can see and monitor scorching on that side with the new geometry. We shall see. Microscopic images? No I don’t have any just yet.But let’s first be seeing the ones on which descriptions like “discontinuities” and “striations” are based and held up as “impossible” to achieve by any known means, except uv laser beams, corona discharges etc. Ordinary thermal energy, presented in a range of ways, should not be prematurely ruled out until thoroughly tested.The answer may be as much in the technology as the science, with the added uncertainty of ageing effects always the untestable factor that has to be considered..","date":"2013-11-16","mins":"10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/its-a-negative-its-3d-yes-maybe-sort-of/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It’s a negative.

I’d go further, and say i do not understand Thibault’s aversion to the idea of the image being a superficial scorch, since that does not exclude authenticity. STURP described the chemical nature of the image layer essentially as a scorch, even if not using that precise term, i.e. As carbohydrate that had undergone chemical dehydration, oxidation etc. The various radiation hypothesis all envisage some reaction with linen carbohydrates that do not require the presence of other chemicals except those in air, so why not describe the discoloration as a radiation scorch? Maybe it’s the idea of a contact scorch that Thibault objects to, i.e. From a hot inanimate template as might be used by a medieval forger, but who’s to say that the chemical changes are not dissimilar to that produced by any other scorched on imprint obtained by a completely different mechanism that is more compatible with authenticity. We’re constantly told that the image characteristics (extreme superficiality, encoded 3 D information, lack of fluorescence) are impossible to achieve by any known method, Is that really science calling the shots on the acceptable narrative, or is the accepted narrative attempting to call the shots on the science? I know what I think (especially after confirming what others before me have discovered, namely that there is no mystery regarding 3 D). It’s that “inimitable” superficiality that is my next objective for study, knowing that ultra thin surface layers that profoundly alter behaviour are commonplace in chemistry (like a 2nm thick oxide film that protects the otherwise highly corrodible aluminium). Is the image layer really as superficial as claimed, given that image fibres are easier to fracture than non image. Why should a 200nm thick layer weaken the entire fibre? What about the hemicelluloses that are in the core of the fibre, admixed with crystalline cellulose. Might they not be susceptible to pyrolysis too, as well as the PCW hemicelluloses? Surely any information of pyrolysis of linen carbohydrates (“scorching”), regardless of how achieved, is better than no information at all. Do we really have to accept STURP’s “scorch in all but name” conclusion as the last word on the subject? Why has the term “scorch” become a pejorative one, given it makes no assumptions about mechanism? Maybe Tjhibault’s objection is aimed solely at contact scorches, with zero air gap.

The task appears simpler by doubling the size of the 3 D model as there will be more vertical height, therefore more gradation from the scorching; (2) do you have some clear 100x or 200x photographs of the linen fibers of your experiments (hopefully taken with a microscope with possibly different lighting conditions)?; (3) don’t you get a gradual amount of dehydration (and potentially of colors) of the fibers depending on the distance from the model to the cloth?

I do, or rather did. So list the differences if you wish, Thibaullt, if you think they are important. But don’t forget to mention the fact that dried onion epidermis, just one cell thick, consists of little more than two primary cell walls, lacking the much thicker, robust secondary cell wall of plant fibres like flax bast cells (“linen fibres”). .Those tough fibres are primarily thick secondary cell walls. So how come a pair of skinny primary cell walls is somehow able to block the passage of heat, sufficient to protect what’s underneath from scorching, while the vastly thicker flax cell wall cannot. Sure you can list differences, Thibault. Why have you not done so already? But as I say, there’s one obvious difference that one might have expected to make onion epidermis ineffective – the absence of a secondary cell wall – but which did not. What’s more, I’ve provided a scientific explanation: namely that scorching, i.e. Chemical dehydration of linen carbohydrates, is highly endothermic, causing rapid cooling of the template, and making the process highly superficial at the cellular level.

Nice of your to honour us with your presence. I have been a great admirer of much of your work, and have said so here and in a number of postings on my own sites. Shame then that we have to launch into contentious matters of detail on our first acquaintance, but this retired science bod does relish the detail, indeed the cut and thrust of scientific debate, so I’ll make a start in addressing one or two of the points you raise. Forgive my saying but you appeared to have started with some pretty fixed preconceptions, judging by that phrase “to try to avoid image blurring that results from a full relief caused by thermal radiation” (my italics). Given the aim of the exercise is to reproduce, or at any rate, attempt to reproduce, medieval technology, if only to test to destruction any ideas about forgery, then why make any a priori assumptions about the mechanisms of heat or other energy transfer involved in image production? In fact, I fail to understand why radiation should ever have entered into your thinking at all given that white, or whiteish, linen reflects or transmits most of the visible white light or infrared radiation that falls upon it (and perhaps we could leave speculation re ultraviolet to Dr.Di Lazzaro and his super imaginative ENSA colleagues).Scorches that result from contact with heated bronze statues, or of bas or high relief templates are the result of pyrolysis by DIRECT contact, with NO air gap, involving conducted heat through atom to atom contact, the signature for which, reported by Ray Rogers for the Shroud, is selective scorching on or immediately adjacent to the crowns of threads. He himself stated that radiation could not produce that effect – that radiation would produce a more diffuse zone of pyrolysis. And what if there had been some “blurring” of the image? So what? The Australian who supervised my Ph D (the late Terence Hallinan at Royal Hospital School of Medicine )impressed on me a simple, no nonsense philosophy when it comes to embarking on new experiments: ” Just suck it and see”. Yup, suck it and see – don’t try to anticipate all the problems and subtleties in advance, don’t over intellectualise – just SIAS. Pre soaking? (incidentally, I was and am still am hugely impressed by those experiments of yours, especially the discovery of “encoded 3 D information” in your thermal imprints – what I call scorchographs – I can improve on that. Imprint onto dry linen, but with a backing pad of moist fabric that has been soaked thoroughly then wrung out. The latter acts as a heat sink and as an agent to facilitate partial or complete “wrap around” imprinting. An alternative to a damp dishcloth is SNOW. I’m waiting for our present snow to settle to test out snow as an alternative to a damp pad, or the sand bed I proposed a while ago, Tin man? Tongue was firmly in cheek when I used that term, which originated with someone else on the site, possibly Dan himself. I’ll stop here for now, but could let you know my views on those blood stains later. Be warned, however. I would be wanting to cast an exceedingly jaundiced eye at any claims made for blood that, we are all agreed, is centuries old. That’s with or without some initial thermal denaturation of haemoglobin about which there is much I am tempted to say of a disparaging nature, especially re that remarkable role proposed for bilirubin (a bile pigment I studied for 2 years at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital School of Medicine) which is said to account for some chameleon like colour changes from red to brown and back to bright red again.

I suspect that those without a chemical background are unable to appreciate how thermal energy (heat) interacting with a surface layer can cause changes that are highly superficial – a few hundreds of nanometres at most (of the same order as the wavelength of visible light) yet be minor, indeed trivial, where the entire structure at the macroscopic level is concerned. Think breathing onto a cold window pane to get a feathery Jack Frost pattern, or a rainbow coloured oil film on water… We all of us, scientists included, underestimate the ability of the eye to detect change or damage in surfaces at the microscopic, sometimes sub light microscopic level.

I have expressed admiration for the approach he took in his bas relief studies (any references to a statue being a misreading of one of his own accounts, which I now realize was probably referring to earlier work of others). But bas relief versus statue cannot be sensibly discussed until one is clear as to the method of imprinting, right down to the very last detail, but the method depends on whether one is using direct contact (for which I see no alternative) or whether one is asking the reader to envisage uv or xrays emanating from the subject, which frankly I consider laughable in theory, and in any case unachievable in practice where forming an image on linen is concerned as distinct from small area of discoloration. So let me put a straight question to Dr.Jackson. Does he still see a role for radiation? If so, from what region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and how does that square with the many distinctive characteristics of the Shroud image, notably selective scorching of crown fibres? Until we hear his answer, can Dan please withdraw the accusation, whether at first or secondhand, that it is I who has been misleading?

If using an inanimate template, one can make it as a bas relief, anticipating lateral distortions, and go modelling accordingly. I see nothing in the 3 D images of the Shroud to exclude modelling off templates by contact, and indeed can see a lot that suggests that was exactly the method employed. But I am hugely entertained by the attempts of New Age Physics to persist with its wacky radiation model, especially as it now seems to require a water bath to get the necessary radiation attenuation that would permit capture of cloth image distance and “3 D encoding”.

Insights always come from unexpected places — the scientist who denies that is no scientist, but merely a computer. Leeches? Far from being wacky, it was a considered systematic and logical attempt to respond to a challenge from someone on this site, who suggested there were daunting practical problems in applying blood as paint to linen. How would you able to paint with blood that starts to clot almost as soon as it is drawn, and who would be willing to supply that blood? Well, it’s a historical fact that bloodletting has been used as a means of treating disease since time immemorial, so there was no shortage of blood for use as “paint”., but there was still the problem with coagulation. That’s when I remembered that leeches have been used as a means of withdrawing blood, that the amounts can be quite large, say 10 ml, that it takes the leech months to digest each meal, that the blood does not clot because the leech secretes an anticoagulant. On further reading I discovered two other facts that could explain some puzzling findings from STURP. Leeches are only interested in the haemoglobin, and quickly get red of the watery plasma. That could explain why Shroud “blood” is strangely deficient in potassium and maybe sodium too. Then there was Rogers’ finding of a large amount of 4 hydroxyproline in blood. Why – given it’s a breakdown product of collagen and connective tissue, and one does not expect a lot in blood. But a leech has a lot of collagen, which may have contaminated semi digested blood taken from a squashed leech for use as paint. Oh, and let’s not forget that atypical spectrum that Adler obtained for Shroud porphyrin. Who’s to say that was not the spectrum of semi digested haemoglobin, instead of his wacky bilirubin hypothesis. Portray me too as wacky if you wish, David, but you only get away with it because I don’t have access to the Shroud. If I did, I would willingly sink some of my own resources into having a proper and thorough analysis done on the haemoglobin and its degradation products, considering that STURP barely scratched the surface, and as soon as anomalous results were obtained, instantly resorted to conjectures based on trauma and crucifixion.

The focus of my posting is quicklime (a vicious substance that has to be handled with great care), one that gives a highly exothermic reaction with water, including I propose migrating body moisture from a linen enclosed corpse on a bed of quicklime, and which on contact might generate enough heat to produce a thermal imprint on the fabric. Limestone if you’ll forgive my saying is irrelevant, at least in my chosen thermochemical context. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), the end product of reaction between quicklime and water, may have a supporting role to play, by virtue of its alkaline properties, an adjunct that may speed carbohydrate pyrolysis. Limestone however is not an alkali – being insoluble in water (ignoring the additional chemistry that comes into play when CO2 is present).

Might the ancient Egyptians have used quicklime for accelerated mummification? Might a certain 1st century corpse have been removed from its rock tomb for mummification, producing an imprint on the enveloping shroud? Might it have been rumours of the imprint that captured folk’s imaginations (a variant on Wesselow), a more discreet proxy for the desiccated corpse?

When references are made to the importance of cloth body distance, that involves a radiation model (yes?). So differences in image intensity that are supposed to represent differences in cloth body distance are assuming that Newton’s Inverse Square Law is operating (yes?). But all the radiation models I have seen that lack imaging lenses etc have to assume collimated (“unspread out”) radiation. But why would that obey Newton’s Inverse Square Law? Newton’s Inverse Square Law is based on the supposition that radiation streams out in all directions as a cone, with an ever larger but fainter circle of light on a screen the further from the source of radiation, falling off as the square of distance. So why is cloth body distance a factor when one is having to assume collimated radiation? If there is no speading out of the radiation, it should not matter whether the cloth is 1cm or 1 metre from the radiating object. So there has to be some other reason for the fading of image intensity that is unrelated to radiation (yes?). That means other mechanisms of image imprinting have to be considered (yes?). Reminder: there are three chief mechanisms for transfer of thermal energy between two bodies – assuming it is thermal energy that has produced the tan coloured dehydration products of linen carbohydrates – namely radiation, conduction and convection. Raymond Rogers had no time for radiation models. Nor do I. So forgive me if I switch off when folk refer blithely to cloth body distances. That is not dispassionate objective science. It is (more often than not) agenda driven, subjective “science”… I believe that the Shroud image has to be examined as a product of conduction (primarily) and convection effects, involving very close contact between subject and cloth. Conduction requires zero distance of separation, but convection probably allows a little more, maybe a few mm, possibly a cm or two at most. But conduction and convection are accommodated better in models that assume the correctness of the radiocarbon dating… Take away message: if Shroud authenticity is to be buttressed by science, it has to be science that operates according to the known laws of physics. Collimated radiation, indeed any kind of emitted radiation, stretches credulity. Collimated radiation that results in cloth body distance as a factor makes no sense at all to someone like me whose science background is traditional and no doubt boring to some...","date":"2013-11-03","mins":"9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/maybe-the-3d-data-doesnt-mean-what-we-think-it-does/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Maybe the 3D data doesn’t mean what we think it does"},{"id":"comment-49814","author":"colin_berry","post":"“No, the Newton’s Inverse Square Law plays no vital role here. Jackson assumes that there is some opaque medium (like air in case of the UV), some “cloud” that is responsible for intensity distance correlation, according to the law: I=I(0)*exp[ tau] , where tau is optical depth of the medium.” That all looks impressively scientific, especially as it tries to gain an exemption from Newton’s Inverse Square Law. But I don’t think it does the business, at least in the context of Rogers’ model, whether you call it diffusion, convection or a mixture of both, and I’ll tell you why. If you are going to posit that something in the intervening air is radio opaque and is absorbing radiation so as to give the impression that Newton’s Law is being obeyed for collimated beams, you have to consider another Law – the most fundamental one of all in physics, namely the Law of Conservation of Energy. If your mysterious source of radiant energy is being absorbed on the way to its target (linen), then its energy cannot just disappear. It has to be converted to another form of energy. Without knowing the wavelengths being proposed it’s a matter of guesswork, though it would have to be longer wavelength energy, probably infrared. That’s the thermodynamics – the start and result if you like. But consider the kinetics too, that the absorption of radiant energy will increase the kinetic energy of electrons in chemical bonds causing excitation, or simply increased bond vibration, and sooner or later, probably sooner, that energy will be transferred to neighbouring air molecules as increased kinetic energy, i.e translation, straight line speed. In other words the air would heat up, expand, cause thermal convection currents etc, and almost certainly destroy any imaging system that depends on diffusion or convection. It would be nice to think that Shroudology could open up new undreamt of fields of physics, but I personally would prefer to know about those new phenomena first from other systems than have them snuck in the back door so to speak by folk who are trying to work their way around Newton’s Law..","date":"2013-11-03","mins":"9:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/maybe-the-3d-data-doesnt-mean-what-we-think-it-does/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Maybe the 3D data doesn’t mean what we think it does"},{"id":"comment-49734","author":"colin_berry","post":"Anoxie : The most convincing point relating the data to a cloth body distance would be to correct the distortions according to the projection/formation mechanism and see which model is the best match to a real human form.

So correct me if I’m wrong, the model has since been refined to incorporate the idea of laminar flow, as distinct from random diffusion in all directions, and one needs laminar flow to get enough mass transfer anyway, aided perhaps by elevated temperature (though it’s hard to see how the temperature in a rock tomb, even with post mortem changes, can ever be high enough to kick start a Maillard reaction with a very steep temperature response curve (probably a reflection of unfavourable thermodynamics as well as kinetics).

Why are we using onionskin? Its ranges from about 200 to 400 microns in thickness. That’s microns. That’s 200,000 to 400,000 nanometers. Onion skin is like about 1000 x thicker than the image on the shroud.” First, why the picture of an intact onion with some brown outer skin lying next to it – as if the latter were the onion epidermis used in my experiments. Onion epidermis is stripped off the inner white scale leafs as a thin membrane.. Yes, the onion epidermis is a fraction of a mm thick – say 1/5, so orders of magnitude greater than the primary cell wall. So what? Have I ever said different? There seems to me an attempt to conflate two entirely different issues. One is the thickness of the image layer on the Shroud, which we are told is 200nm, which is the approximate thickness of the primary cell wall (PCW) of the flax fibril, of which there may be up to 200 per thread. But there is also the SEPARATE issue to do with scorching. Time and again I have been told that it would be impossible to scorch a superficial 200nm image on linen without producing a scorch that penetrates beneath the PCW or into deeper fibres. Why? All one has to assume is that the outermost cells of flax fibres accept the image onto their PCW, but the entire cell many times thicker, protects the underlying cells and fibres from scorching in the manner shown here for onion epidermis.

His emailed “comments”, read trolling, were elevated by the site’s host to guest slot. Since this post is now the topic of a new posting over there, I have put together this speedy response to a selection of the more critical comments that are appearing. Some of the latter carry a whiff of vindictive troll like character to them, attempting to destroy the credibility of this retired scientist, or to suggest that he lacks a grasp of the literature, especially re Rogers’ largely speculative “impurity coating” hypothesis, seemingly ignorant of the primary cell wall and much else besides (reactive hemicelluloses etc). Here’s a cut and paste, with their comments in bold, my replies in italics, Scorching Onion Skins March 9, 2014 Dan I want to call your attention to an interesting discussion going on over at Colin Berry’s site in his posting (link provided) First, Thibault wrote: Colin, “Can you explain step by step your onion experiment ? I am not sure to understand well, but I see no connection with the scorch hypothesis on the Shroud.” Colin Responded: I’m a little surprised I have to explain (all over again) what to me seems self evident. Never mind. Let’s start again. And it goes from there. For more on the subject see, Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick, a posting on Colin’s blog from two years ago. • anoxie March 9, 2014 at 7:22 am | #1 If you consider oignon is mainly made of starch and sugars, it looks like the suggested hoax recipe based on a thin external layer : Rogers : “Using a cloth washed in a low surface tension solution containing pentose sugars (e.g., a Saponaria solution) and dried in the sun, a non metallic statue at a temperature above 100 C might have worked.” A thin oignon layer doesn’t absord much heat, it protects only very slightly and briefly the linen. It is just more sensitive to lower temperature. Someone whose default position is the Rogers’ starch/sugar impurity layer. Where’s the analytical evidence (authoritative, that is, not semi anecdotal) for there being an even coating of those two substances on the Shroud, or of them being in non image layers etc etc? Oh, and there’s no starch in an onion. Sugars – glucose, fructose, sucrose certainly but not starch. How difficult is it to spend a few minutes on a search engine instead of cluttering up the internet with easily spotted falsehoods? As regards the thermal protection, read what I wrote. The epidermis gives excellent protection from the hot metal, when the latter still contains demonstrably sufficient heat to scorch linen. So the point about the epidermis being more sensitive to scorching, while true, is largely irrelevant. You may disagree with my interpretation, but please desist from misrepresenting the experimental observations, and/or omit to mention my crucial reference to the control experiment. Mike M March 9, 2014 at 8:23 am | #2 I don’t get it? We have linen, why experiment on onions. Or is it claimed that the whole shroud was covered in onion? This is what happens when you perform experiments in the kitchen. Well, if you think some more about imaging onto linen, with at least three annular zones (PCW, SCW and cell membrane/cytoplasm) then the term “linen” becomes problematical. Which layer or layers of linen are scorched in the present Shroud, and which others may have been present initially, but have since detached through being more extensively scorches and rendered brittle? Yes, I like simple explanations too, but one has to distinguish between simple and simplistic. Anoxie March 9, 2014 at 8:58 am | #3 I guess a 4.4×1.1m linen cloth can be produced today not manually woven but I don’t think the weaving whether manual or automatic makes a difference in the image. What’s your point? The point is modern linen can’t be directly compared to the shroud. Even “manual” weaving is semi automated, inasmuch as there will be heddles that have to be raised and lowered, so one has to be specific if one’s to make any useful comment. (What was your point btw?). There is some, possibly quite a lot of comparison that can be made between modern and centuries opld linen, assuming they are both retted flax fibres. Technological aids to assist spinning and weaving will differ of course, but let’s not repeat Rogers mistake of looking to Pliny for clues (saponins etc), thereby betraying a lack of scientific objectivity (his task being to prove/disprove authenticity, not to take a 1st century provenance as his working hypothesis). Mike M March 9, 2014 at 9:34 am | #4 Sorry Anoxie, I still can’t get it. What your saying would make sense if Colin is talking about scorching an impurity layer (like Rogers postulated) but he is talking about primary cell wall. What is the difference between primary cell wall of antient linen and modern linen? At last. A valid point. Yes, my focus is very much on the primary cell wall (PCW) for which Rogers had a blind spot (or an inadequate grasp of botany). Anoxie March 9, 2014 at 9:42 am | #5 I’ve just pointed the similarities, meaning he’s got a degraded idea of what Rogers suggested years ago. I have done very extensive and detailed critiques of Rogers “suggestions”, and that’s the trouble. Most of ideas re the impurity layer, and the Maillard hypothesis are little more than suggestions that have not been backed up by experimental evidence. His critique of scorching was not terribly impressive either. Clublu22014 March 9, 2014 at 8:55 am | #6 But I don’t understand any heat hypothesis when Barrie Schwortz has stated over and over again that the Image doesn’t fluoresce that means it wasn’t heat induced. Barrie Schwortz is a photographer, not a chemist. Were he a chemist he would know that the presence or absence of fluorescence in model v ancient scorches can tell you nothing for certain unless you know something about the physical and chemical nature of the fluorescent species. Are they really furfurals as some have suggested, which are (a) volatile and (b) prone to oxidation, with loss of fluorescence over time. I suspect the fluorescent species are many and probably more complex than relatively simple furfurals. (Am not even certain the latter are strongly fluorescent) Mike M March 9, 2014 at 9:39 am | #7 Clublu22014; I totally agree, not only that but scorched linen show up in transmitted light photography while the shroud image doesn’t. And the lumen of the fibres are discoloured while the shroud image doesn’t show any lumen discolouration. This is a prime example of how the anti authenticity camp would go to any length (not supported by science) to discredit the shroud. With the hacking hypothesis we have been seeing both extremes of the spectrum. Transmitted light? How can one be certain that the original Shroud centuries ago had the same properties as the one we see now, after yellowing, ageing, oxidation etc etc? Lumen not discoloured? The lumen is a hole, so any discoloration is likely to be due to the remnants of the original living flax cell (membrane, cytoplasm etc). Who’s to say that some fibres did not originally have extensive scorching that penetrated to the lumen interface, but compromised the core of the fibre so much as to make them break off over the centuries, leaving less extensively scorched fibres – thus creating the so called “halftone effect” (an over optimistic, dare one say hifalutin term if ever there was)? clublu22014 commented on Scorching Onion Skins. In response to Mike M: Clublu22014; I totally agree, not only that but scorched linen show up in transmitted light photography while the shroud image doesn’t.

(However I am having a bit of a quandary as to just exactly what the identification of the lumen is regarding the fibril of the linen… It seems obvious that it is the outside molecules of the fibril’s tubing not necessarily the inside.

What folly. If you will but toss a bit of linen and an onion skin into a fry pan you can see why. The onion skin turns brown quickly. I suspect that it caramelizes at lower temperatures and much faster than linen scorches. You just don’t mess with different materials without testing or researching, not if you are a good scientist.” Well, there is a simple experiment I can do, or rather refine, to address that criticism. I shall simply press the hot template down with part in contact with onion epidermis, and part in contact with linen. When I have a faint or even strong imprint on the linen, i shall then peel back the onion epidermis to see if it has protected the underlying linen. I believe it should be possible to produce that result, based on some existing results of mine, unpublished, where there is very faint, incipient scorching of linen, but heavy scorching of epidermis. Yes, the epidermis does scorch more readily. I have already acknowledged that, and suggested that different chemistry operates – forming Maillard sugar protein reaction products and pyrolysed hemicellulose/cellulose respectively. However, i shall add that experiment onto the end of the post describing the onion skin data. I shall not be discussing science here in future in view of the pre moderation/editing policy now in force to say nothing of general unpleasant backbiting tone of many of the comments. I must also ask Dan to desist from pirating pictures and text off my site describing my original research, at least until a decent time period has elapsed, say 1 week. Would it not be courteous, to say the least, to write a brief summary and provide a link to my own site? Colin Berry I shall have a go at doing that experiment this morning, hoping that I have enough onion epidermis to get a conclusive result (involving as it does some trial and error, since I cannot see under the contact area to judge when to remove the hot metal).

This site operates under a Word Press default system that requires my approval of the first comment. Subsequent ones go through without requiring approval. If a commenter were to become defamatory and ignored warnings I would simply place a block on all their comments. Yup, it’s all or nothing where this site is concerned. There is a lot of ignorance or misundersatnding on the other site regarding the superficial and chemical nature of the scorching phenomenon, with the word “impossible” being tossed around with gay abandon. I shall be using this thread over the next few days to pinpoint some of the misunderstanding and, most importantly, misinformation. It is my firm belief that a deliberate and systematic attempt is being made to expunge “scorching” from the Shroud literature. One can see this attempt going back years, if not decades, to suppress or deny what I would see as a self evident explanation for the Shroud image. Now why would anyone want to dismiss scorching – by heat that is – as an explanation, while being eager to play around with high energy radiation (ultraviolet, x rays, gamma rays etc)? Why go to the trouble of producing tiny discoloured blemishes on linen that might also be described as (radiation) scorches while dogmatically excluding thermal scorches, especially those produced by physical contact/heat conduction? The expression “agenda driven research” springs to mind. And the Shroudie roadshows are clearly intended to keep alive the “mystery of the Shroud”, the “haunting” (and scarcely visible) image of which “defies modern understanding”.

I said that it was the pyrolysis of hemicellulose that was exothermic, that it differed in that respect from cellulose (endothermic) which was why one could get selective scorching of the hemicellulosewithout the cellulose being in the least bit affected. Maybe it was a typo on Dr.Lazzaro’s part, but looking at the references to cellulose medullas I doubt it. I think he has seriously misunderstood the essence of the hemicellulose model. Maybe it’s a language thing – his English is better than my virtually non existent Italian, so I shall give him the benefit of the doubt, but I really see no useful purpose is served in prolonging this discussion any further. As far as I am concerned, Dr.Lazzaro has said nothing to change my view that the Shroud image was formed by thermal imprinting by direct contact/conduction. Any role for radiation would have been a minor one, because there is no mechanism for radiation induced scorching in the absence of an opaque absorbing pigment.

Firstly the title: “heat cannot produce a superficial coloration”. I could have shot that notion down in flames, even if I had no scientific background. Temperature is a CONTINUOUS VARIABLE (you can set it to any value you want). If heating to 100 degrees produces no coloration, but 300 degrees does, then what do yuou do? You try 250. If that produces coloration, then you keep reducing the temperature, first by, say, 10 degree steps, then 1 degree steps, until you get a barely perceptible coloration. Heat (more accurately temperature) has then produced a superficial coloration. Chances are that the chemical degradation scorch mark is highly superficial, affecting only a very thin layer (e.g. Of cell wall dimensions, say 200nm). Getting a faint scorch is simply a matter of applying the Goldilocks principle. This would seem to me to be plain common sense. Light scorching is not the equivalent of lighting blue touch paper on a firework display (“all or nothing”). It is gradual, it is progressive, at least at the gross level. But having said that,an “all or nothing” effect would appear to operate at the level of individual fibres (of which there are some 200 per thread) in order to account for the half tone effect, which I think is due to pyrolysis of hemicellulose being exothermic (in other words, once started, it tends to keep going until all the available, accessible “incendiary” hemicellulose used up..","date":"2012-02-21","mins":"8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/modelling-the-image-of-the-turin-shroud-an-interrupted-experiment/","cat":"branding","title":"Modelling the image of the Turin Shroud – an interrupted experiment using onion epidermis – just one cell thick."},{"id":"comment-24","author":"colin_berry","post":"“According with a paper quoted by Berry, the onset of pyrolysis in hemicelluloses is at about 220°C.

That is not the same as onset of pyrolysis as measured by change in light absorption (yellow coloration). The latter involves more subtle chemical change that does not involve loss of volatiles. Try repeating your experiment at 220, then 210, then 200 etc until you discover a cut off point. That’s what experimentalists do – they make systematic changes in the continuous variable, exploring the entire range of interest – not plumping for one temperature just because someone said it’s the only one that matters on some entirely different yardstick.

Using simple materials – metal castings, olive oil, white flour and an oven one can obtain images that while blurry could be mistaken for 19th century photographic negatives. What’s more, they are not necessarily my best images that are obtainable from those two horse brasses. I had started yesterday substituting rice for wheat flour as imprinting medium, leaving an area of the fabric (linen and cotton) free of imprint that could be removed after oven baking and tested for its ability to take a fresh imprint after that pre baking step. Yes, images were obtained with the rice flour onto the unbaked linen and cotton, though not as good as MIGHT have been seen with wheat flour. In other words, wheat flour has still to be tested on all four combinations of wheat/cotton/unbaked fabric/baked fabric. The image in this posting was from just one of those 4 (wheat/baked cotton). Today I shall test all 4 combinations in the same session, and see which gives the best result. Regardless, one has a technology that delivers results that are reminiscent of those obtainable when bas relief objects cast in metal, or carved into softer materials – lino, raw potato even are used in conjunction with paint as a means of printing images (as with modern day T shirts). The difference is that mine is a thermal imprinting technique that appears to produce a final image that is chemically bonded onto the heat resistant cellulose fibres of the fabric, at least some being resistant to washing with soap and water. Might we be seeing here the technology that was deployed in the 14th century to produce the image of the man on the Shroud? More work is needed to characterize that final wash resistant image, whether obtained on linen or cotton, used ‘as is’ or pre baked, and to try and understand the mechanism by which the colour migrates from the roasting flour with its ongoing Maillard reactions into the underlying weave of the fabric. Might oil play a role in the migration, as suggested previously by this investigator last year when first reporting on the flour imprinting model?

That was clearly the case when shroudstory.com was still going, but those prepared to explore all the Google page 1 listings can find one’s being noted and appreciated elsewhere. Example: the fourth return for (shroud of turin) is a site called ancient origins which did a feature on the Shroud of Turin (DNA analysis) in October last year. This blogger contributed a number of comments to that thread, including some with original research (on the so called ‘lateral distortion’ effect). Those comment earned this appreciative response from the site’s Acting Editor: lizleafloor wrote on 23 February, 2016 – 15:55 Wow! You really went above and beyond – nice work! It’s great to see results of experimentation. Thanks very much Colin. (later comment from Liz Leafloor) The investment in time and effort you’ve made is appreciated. I’ve been following the discussion here with great interest, as we all do at Ancient Origins (we might not always chime in though, unless someone has a direct question) as we want to hear what our readers think. Keep up the great work 🙂 The suggestion here that this blogger operates in a vacuum is ill informed and totally uncalled for. The problem one has right now is (a) a poverty of research oriented sites (b) the blinkered refusal of wiki to recognize blog postings as valid sources of new data and insights (c) the bias that Google and other search engine show for articles that appear in mass media outlets, regardless of quality, and tending to self perpetuate once initial clicks have establish them high in a list of returns, then being the first to be seen and clicked long after their topicality and indeed value has passed.(d) the overwhelmingly ‘pro authenticity’ nature of online sindonology that guarantees off message sites such as this one will be totally and DELIBERATELY ignored. Do not expect to find generosity of spirit in sindonology.

Prior to using an article, you should always contact its author and ask for permission to use it on your own site. Once permission has been granted, be sure you link prominently to the original source and notify the original author as soon as it has been posted. You’ll likely find that in many cases, the author will promote the repost on social media, possibly bringing you a few new followers along the way.

Nope, you would not have discovered it by entering (shroud of turin) into Google (google.com that is, i.e. The one you get when googling Stateside). Why not? Because according to google.com, this site does not exist, despite the hundreds of postings here and on my sciencebuzz site, despite any number of ‘curated’ versions of the postings having appeared on Dan Porter’s shroudstory.com, prior to its being wound up December last year. So have I been doing something wrong at a technical level, perhaps, that has kept me off google.com’s radar screen? That was the persistent message from Dan Porter, suggesting ever so helpfully I was maybe not doing this or that right (like failing to make proper links to social media sites etc). Well, I’m doing something right here in my own country, inasmuch as entering (shroud of turin) into google (which is automatically google.uk by default, NOT google.com) shows me on page 4, with which I’m entirely content. So how do I know I’m not listed (or more probably have been DE LISTED) on google.com? Answer? By typing google.com/ncr into the address bar. Ncr is short for ‘no country redirect’, which takes me to the US version, not the default UK one. So, I post new and original onto my blog sites in the UK, most of it anti authenticity needless to say. It gets instantly hoovered up and ‘curated’ by a US based site (up till December). My claims and sometimes even full name frequently appear in those titles. Result: a US based site uses my content to preserve or even enhance its position on Page 1 of google.com returns. Oh, and let’s not forget the 2000 and more comments I’m said by the site owner to have placed on that site. And what do I get? At best a small lift in google.uk, while CONTINUING TO REMAIN INVISIBLE to any Stateside searcher who simply googles (shroud of turin) without the kind of qualifiers (white flour etc) that presuppose a subject ‘insider’ with prior knowledge. So why is this happening – something that is censorship by any other name? It’s not only shroudstory that is or was into the business of content curation. Google almost certainly does it as well, as I’ve discovered from closely following the fate of what I currently post on entirely different topics (Stonehenge etc). Google’s curation of its algorithm generated raw returns can happen within hours, sometimes minutes: one wonders whether the regulatory authorities in Europe are aware of this (possibly not, judging by its half hearted threats to make Google reveal its algorithm, assuming that it’s robotic, pre programmed IT technology alone that is promoting Google’s own sites and businesses at competitors’ expense). When curation becomes effective censorship, the problem with Google becomes far, far more serious than one of anti competitive abuse of market leader near monopoly’. Google Curate as I now call it (or, on bad days. Google the Hutt) might, just (might just) be sufficient to explain why I’m invisible to stateside searchers. But I doubt that is the entire issue. There’s another even more disturbing possibility that needs to be addressed, namely that third party interests in the States, with or without the passive cooperation or even active connivance of Google, are preventing the general searcher from seeing new ideas that conflict with someone’s all consuming, single minded agenda. Quite how that could work in practice, e.g. Whether it works via paying extra to eliminate off message content, or indirectly by failing to place ads on Google, or serially placing/withdrawing as reward/punishment, is anyone’s guess. The mere fact that these possibilities exist in theory should be sufficient to make the leaders of the so called Free World take preemptive action against Google (not forgetting less popular search engines) e.g. By making them sign up to a code of practice, maybe voluntary to start with. Failing that, they could be required to give prominent “health warnings” on their home page to those naive or foolish enough to assume that the returns they see, unless flagged otherwise, are free of covert commercial – or worse still ideological taint. We always used to think the danger came from a Big Brother “watching you” probably from the ‘closed society’ side of the old Iron Curtain. Instead it’s coming from a supposedly open society Big Brother ensconced in Silicon Valley USA, or rather one of his army of 53,000 employees (!).

One particular gripe is the way that a particular story, in this instance the Nature DNA report, appears 17 times no less in the first 10 pages of returns (that’s 17% approx of the total, blocking out others – like ME!!) merely because it’s been reported upon by 17 different news outlets. That is frankly ridiculous, given that all but one are secondary reports that add virtually nothing to the original except instant opinion from a journalist or agency reporter who in most cases is ill equipped to judge the quality or significance of the data (indeed, the readers’ comments, if invited, can often be a lot more cogent and well informed ). Fortunately then, Nature journal itself has a comments facility hosted by Disqus, of which this blogger availed himself, using his Colin B login. I took the liberty of adding my full name at the end, as well as the doctorate degree (not something I do often, but considered might be worth flagging up for the benefit of Nature’s primarily scientific readership, to say nothing of helping to get the comment approved – .given that current comments at any rate are all pre moderated)..","date":"2016-02-22","mins":"6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures."},{"id":"comment-7099","author":"colin_berry","post":"It’s 2 months since I last placed a comment on this my Turin Shroud site. I’ve been busy elsewhere – like my sciencebuzz site – but also picking up the threads of an investigation into some other enigmas that were temporarily shelved some 4 years ago. Here’s a summary posted just a few minutes ago on that other multi enigma system – Neolithic Britain’s Wiltshire’s monuments (Stonehenge, Avebury stone circle, Silbury Hill etc): https://sussingstonehenge.wordpress.com/ 1.Stonehenge, Avebury and other standing stones served as bird perches, the latter being encouraged to ‘adopt’ the site for the purpose of excarnation of the recently deceased. The primary purpose of excarnation was to (a) release the soul and (b) to isolate the skeleton that was then further cleansed by cremation. The cremated bones were then either buried in situ, OR interred in a nearby round or long burial barrow OR taken back by relatives to the deceased’s home. 2.Silbury Hill was a repository for soft organs, probably harvested prior to avian or other excarnation, possibly the heart only. Silbury was what might be called a local speciality provided at the Avebury site/complex, some distance from the Stonehenge/Durrington Walls/Woodhenge/barrow complex i.e. 25 miles away. The soft organs were probably interred with a handful of the deceased’s local turf and soil, probably with a deliberate inclusion of earthworms to ensure complete integration between old and new soil. 3.The carpentry aka woodworking joints at Stonehenge were an aid to construction, rather then necessary for final stability (see schematic accompanying this post). They served to fix and partly stabilise the intermediary arch like geometry before removal of the earthern “formwork” i.e. The ramp followed by placement of rammed rubble around the base of each pillar for final anchoring of the structure. 4.The bluestones were chosen for the Mark 1 Stonehenge because – being smaller than the Mark 2 sarsens, the working surfaces i.e. Tops were at eye level and thus visible. They would have quickly become unsightly with uneaten flesh, bird droppings etc. Thus the desirability of importing igneous bluestone in place of local sarsen sandstone. That’s because rocks of igneous origin, i.e. Soldified magma and/or lava, (e.g. The predominant dolerites and rhyolites of Preseli and other Welsh ‘bluestones’) are non porous and liquid repellent, and thus easier to keep clean and presentable. It may be the lack of local bluestone that prompted the construction of the sarsen megaliths at Stonehenge. Being so much higher, the tops were largely out of human sight, and thus seen as safer more attractive places for scavenger birds (crows, ravens, rooks, seagulls etc).to perch, feed, roost and maybe even nest..","date":"2016-04-22","mins":"10:09 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures."},{"id":"comment-6998","author":"colin_berry","post":"Here’s a site that ran an article way back in 2014, which still invites comments via Disqus, the most recent labelled somewhat imprecisely as “a year ago”.

It’s the problem faced by anyone attempting to imprint off a 3 D subject – living, dead or statue – onto linen. It’s variously known as “lateral distortion” arising from the so called “wrap around effect”. Sure, it’s easy to demonstrate for oneself at home, say by smearing one’s face with chocolate spread or similar, then lying down and getting someone to press linen onto and around the sides of one’s face. Sure, the result could be the so called Agamemnon mask effect, one where the face looks far too wide, showing that “lateral distortion”. Https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon But what’s this got to do with the Shroud of Turin one might ask? My answer: precious little, if anything, provided one starts by making some reasonable assumptions, like: 1. The Shroud is of medieval origin, if one accepts the radiocarbon dating, warts an’ all. 2. Someone – a medieval artist or mere artisan – set out to model what a double body IMPRINT onto linen might look, first when fresh, and then aged for many centuries. 3. That same individual then did some trial experiments, so became quickly aware of the image distortion that can result from using a 3 D subject to produce a 2 D imprint. 4. That individual did not abandon the project. Instead he persevered to produce the image that today we call the Turin Shroud. So how did he get a realistic looking body image? Answer: he didn’t. That was not his goal. His goal was to produce what would be immediately perceived as a CONTACT IMPRINT. It did not need to look too realistic, like a well executed painting. Had he done so, folk would have scarcely given it a second glance (“Oh look, another devotional work of art”). No, he wanted an image that was strangely unrealistic, and in that respect could be said to have been successful beyond his wildest dreams. So what did he do “right” in terms of producing a highly credible artefact, suggestive of a real body imprint onto a sheet of linen? Answer: he wanted an image that was what today we call a “negative”. Parts of the anatomy that an artist might show in lighter tones, notably the light reflecting prominences such as nose forehead, chin etc, would be shown dark, and parts that an artist might show as dark, due either to being in hollows, like eye sockets, or in the shadows cast by prominences, would be shown as light. Why the need to reverse the tones? Because that’s what happens when one imprints off a 3 D template, instead of placing it in the light and painting it, or taking a modern photograph. Our medieval ‘modeller’ would have been fully aware of the tone reversal that occurs with contact imprinting, from artefacts like brass rubbings, heat scorches from hot irons etc. All that remained was to obtain that negative imprint in a manner that made it IMMEDIATELY obvious to a first time viewer that it was an imprint, not a painting. That required imprinting off the highest relief only, studiously avoiding the slightest hint of wrap around effect. The end result was to produce an imprint akin to that of a footprint in wet sand – negative with “bits missing”. How might that have been best achieved? It was a question of ensuring the technology was fit for purpose, as indeed it was. How was, or might that, have been achieved? End of Part 1. Part 2 is in preparation and will follow in due course.

First, this was no 8000 word splurge, submitted to a single issue of a magazine available at one’s newsagent, guaranteeing lots of Google hits but not much else. This began as a project at the tail end of 2011 with a clear objective – to reproduce the Shroud image in all its subtlety (negative character, superficiality, bleachability etc etc) making due allowance for what probably were minor ageing changes (but not, repeat NOT the major deterioration proposed in that aforementioned magazine article that is frankly a copout, to say nothing of an insult to the intelligence). That was an ambitious objective, and at the outset meant ruling out any prospect of pulling a white rabbit quickly from the hat. It was for that reason that a second objective was chosen: to report the progress (or otherwise) week by week in real time until such a time that one could say – “Well. That’s as far as I intend to go. Judge for yourselves dear reader whether the goal has been achieved.” If I’m not mistaken that second aspect made the project a one off: I’m not aware of any other attempt to use the internet to report a research project informally in real time, warts ‘n’ all .But such is this blogger’s confidence in the scientific method – of setting up hypotheses and testing them to destruction if need be – that it seemed a realistic and worthwhile exercise. Self indulgent maybe, given all the twists and turns? Maybe, in which case the time has come to wind things up, but in a manner that is true to those twin objectives of reproducing an image, explaining how one got there, especially what had to be rejected as well as selected along the way. Here’s what I propose to do next. I shall write a summary of each quarter’s research, starting with Jan/Feb//Mar of 2012, then April/May/June etc up to April/May/June this year (2016). That’s 18 quarters in all, 18 weekly reports, taking us through to autumn this year. Each of those quarterly reports will be a maximum of 1000 words. Anything else I want to say in excess of 1000 words will go into the Comments (where naturally feedback is welcome if judged reasonably civil AND constructive in keeping with the open minded modus operandi of this exercise – I am synthesising a view not proselytizing which means there’s no place for gratuitous insults or browbeating tirades). Finally when that backward look at 4 years of research has been summarized, I will write a grand (or maybe not so grand) summary, again keeping it short (probably 2500 words max), inviting more comments, and then leave it at that. Title: possibly “Modelling the Shroud of Turin, 2016. Are we nearly there yet?” (Nope: change of mind. Too much hard work over too long a time, and who’s going to want to read twenty or so 1,000 words summaries? A single post summary of the 4 year project should suffice). Why call a halt now? Because further progress is scarcely possible without new detailed chemical information on the TS image against which to compare the model systems. I have previously suggested what could usefully be done, e.g. Bleaching image v non image areas with tritium labelled diimide (NT=NT), i.e. Diimide, NH=NH, after partial tritiation, recovering and concentrating radiolabelled material with suitable extraction procedures, identfying the products and/or molecular fragments on glc mass spec and deducing the nature of the chromophore (dehydrated carbohydrate? modified lignin? Maillard reaction product? ) No, I will not be making any proactive advances to mass media outlets, but they are welcome to approach me, on the understanding that they produce the write up – given I confine myself to informal blogs, not articles or books – and am allowed to see any copy before it appears in print, and given an opportunity to make suggestions or corrections)..","date":"2016-06-19","mins":"7:29 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures."},{"id":"comment-6992","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks Thibault, and to you Hugh for your comments.

Https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/ However, it’s simply not true that the body image shows injury or damage to flesh and skin. The evidence for scalp wounds from an otherwise invisible crown of thorns rests on bloodstains on the head and hair. Evidence for a nail wound in a hand or wrist rests on bloodstains alone, and likewise for a lance wound in the side. The scourge marks, supposedly from a Roman flagrum, some 372 of them in all we’re told, are entirely due to imprinted blood, there being no evidence in the body image. One does not wish to make light of the task of the medieval artisan, intent on simulating/modelling what the double body imprint in sweat and blood of the crucified Jesus might look like some 1300 years later, as per radiocarbon dating (1260 1390). But let’s not overstate it either. The task is greatly simplified if there’s no need to simulate wounds (punctures, gashes etc) in the basal body image, if all that needs to be done is to paint blood onto the Shroud linen at all the ‘biblically correct” locations so as merely to SUGGEST the presence of underlying wounds. That’s as far as it goes – suggested, not actual images of wounds,. Why would wounds leave an imprint anyway if still seeping blood? If attempting to apply the scientific method to the mysterious and ‘enigmatic’ Shroud, it’s absolutely imperative that facts be ruthlessly separated from fancy. Were that done more often, the Shroud might seem marginally less mysterious and enigmatic, while still undoubtedly a work of human ingenuity.

No, none of the red is due to “blood fluorescence”, given that the non bloodied nose, beard, chin crease etc are red as well as bloodstains like the “3″ on forehead. The iron has to be chemically stripped out of haem in order to see porphyrin fluorescence, as extensively described by STURP’s Heller and Adler.

The body image would have to be described as fluorescent as well, albeit as yellow rather than red fluorescnce.

Notwithstanding your comment, and notwithstanding that the complete photograph appeared on the cover of the Pellicori and Miller paper, but curiously not inside, about which more later, I’m sticking with my guns. It is NOT a fluorescence photograph, which would probably have shown little more than the serum halos around bloodstains that you mention. It is an Enrie 1931 negative that has been confusing photoedited to give false colour to higer density regions of body image (negative white to red). Here’s a side by side comparison: https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/enrie versus false colour.png?w=300&h=156 The choice of red as false colour makes the picture not only scientifically worthless, but a source of confusion and dare I say pseudoscience, especially if used to support the notion that the beard and moustache and nose etc are heavily bloodstained.

As regards the first part of your comment, I’m having some difficulty deciding whether you agree, disagree, or both as regards my contention that the so called fluorescence photograph does NOT show fluorescence, which as you say would be limited to the margins of bloodstains and thus likely to be scarcely if at all visible in an untouched photograph taken in uv light. So it’s a complete mystery why anyone should have considered the initial photograph needed to be given all that red and yellow false colour, making it seem as if the blood at least was fluorescent – as claimed mistakenly by Jones – and/or making it seems as if there was blood on all those other places mentioned. Why has no one noticed this earlier, given the 1981 paper was published over 35 years ago?

What I have to say now may look superficially like a conspiracy theory, and some may conclude it’s an anti Catholic one. I don’t think you will, or rather hope you won’t, and I say that in the knowledge of your own religious persuasion (I’ve read your book!). Nope, It’s not about Catholicism. It’s about the American (and dare I say Canadian) propensity to place political correctness (i.e not offending perceived sensibilities) at the top of all considerations where expression of opinion is concerned. Individuals self censor, and the MSM follows suit, blocking expression of robust opinions. I have long considered PC to be the scourge of the modern age. So where is this going, and how does this relate to your suggestions? Scarcely a month goes by, as Hugh Farey has observed in his latest News Letter, where we don’t see some hugely speculative idea re the the Turin Shroud and how it acquired its image, virtually all in a 1st century context, ignoring or rejecting the radiocarbon dating. What about the journalists who report these brainwaves, sprinkling their articles with terms like “mystery”, “enigma”, “defying scientific explanation” etc, keeping the show on the road one might say, regardless of their own thoughts that may be well concealed? Do they ever put “shroud of turin” into their search engine? Probably some do, and if based in North America they will get back returns that in my view have all been screened by human agency for that “political correctness”. That is why you will find my site absent if you search on google.com (USA), for which one needs to enter http://www.google.com/ncr (ncr = no country redirection). When I say absent I mean absent – it’s nowhere in any of the 28 pages of returns – extraordinary don’t you think given I’ve produced hundreds of postings on 2 or 3 different sites over 4 years? But if you go to google.uk (or your google.ca) then there’s a chance of picking me up about page 5 to 7 of returns, and in the earlier returns one would appear to have a greater proportion of distinctly sceptical opinions in the titles or brief resume that follows, i.e. Less “PC”. So the journos who bother to look, at least in the USA and probably most in the UK, Canada, Australia and rest of the English speaking world will not, or rather are not allowed to, find my postings and opinions. It’s even worse with the non Google sites like Bing, Yahoo, AOL etc etc. Why, why,why????? What IS going on? I say there’s human intervention, that the returns are not those generated entirely by an algorithm that simply monitors hits, links etc etc. If that were the case, I’d be prominent on google.com, given the number of times Dan Porter used to cover my postings, often putting my name in the title, and invariably inserting links to my sites. As I say, it’s about political correctness, about protecting the sensibilities of Shroud respecting Roman Catholics mainly, whether they want it or not. Robust opinion and free thinking is being censored, and it’s happening in the so called Free World. All of a sudden the Shroud of Turin shrinks in importance. There is a far, far greater issue that needs addressing here, and for me to go cap in hand to a cub reporter would be to acquiesce to something that in my view is totally and utterly wrong. There should be no censorship of the World of Ideas. I understand why the internet may not have turned out to be the potent means I first imagined for reporting a research investigation in real time, given the preponderantly pro authenticity nature of sindonological websites, and just if not more important, the huge popularity of social media, where much that is said goes unreported and/or overlooked by search engines. But I still believe that it should allow the common man a voice in the world of ideas, which incidentally is my preferred description of Shroud research. No, it’s not really the world of science, not hard science, given there’s no means or prospect of testing one’s ideas by taking samples from the real thing for comparison. So I intend now to draw a line under 4 years of internet based research, and leave the MSM – with or without the aid of search engines (almost certainly without) – to find my stuff for themselves. What I may do in the next week or so is make a list of what I consider my 10 chief findings, and add links to the relevant postings. It’ll go up as one more comment, not a new posting.

Another appreciative comment. Thanks David. I must be doing something right at last, or at any rate, marginally less wrong. Yes, flour is not the most obvious imprinting medium, especially if one sets out to simulate sweat (blood imprints being a separate issue).But if you read your Heller, you will see that Sam Pellicori, pro authenticty we are told, set out to model the body imprint using lemon juice and oil, but was immediately given the thumbs down by fellow STURP members, Heller anyway, on the grounds that anything that was soluble would migrate, read smudge, and fail to match TS characteristics, the latter with mainly (but not exclusively!) frontal side imprinting only. Joe Accetta tried to revive a similar idea, one you mention, namely of dye imprinting off woodblocks, and tried to get around the migration issue by incorporating gum arabic, supposedly to increase viscosity and discourage migration. It was an attractive idea, but when I checked it out I found that gum arabic does not in fact appreciably increase viscosity (different from merely adding “bulk”) and was not the answer. Thus the gradual drift to something that was particulate (flour) as distinct from a soluble agent like lemon juice or dye. Am finding when I “unspin” image threads from the flour imprints, the results are virtually the same as obtained with the Mark 1 “scorch model” using much derided one step image making with a heated metal template.

The question of reverse side coloration is one that is preoccupying me somewhat at the moment, basically because it’s so variable. On some specimens, there’s scarcely any reverse side image. On others the reverse side image is virtually indistinguishable from the contact side, and there are no immediate clues as yet to why one sees this variation. It could be something as simple as batch to batch variation with the linen, linked to the thickness, the closeness of weave, my stretching it when wet to reduce creases, prior laundring etc. Or it might be more complex, related maybe to the oven temperature, type or amount of vegetable oil. I shall try to look out the specimens that have mainly TS like frontal image only and photograph them, if only to show there’s no barrier in principle to one sided imprinting, even if I see it less often than I would like. My immediate plans? To take a break in your delightful country, where I shall write my manifesto. Future lines of research? Frankly, there’s not a lot more I can do without specialized equipment. That would include a half decent microscope with improved depth of field, if only to escape the charge from a certain laser expert that I don’t know how to use my focus wheel … I’m especially interested to know the mechanism of coloration in the flour imprinting model. Might it involve the release of a natural oil or other liquid at high temperature that then percolates a short distance between fibres via capillary action (half tone effect?).

But lacking an essential reference if one’s to be certain whose narrative – 1st or 14th century – is correct. The missing reference? The image of the Man on the TS as he looked in life, or how he would have looked without the facial injuries. Sorry, but one cannot deploy the adjective “perfect” and in the same breath describe the features as having suffered injury. Who’s to say the image was not taken by imprinting from a 14th century man, and that the “injuries” are in fact due to deformation of the facial features by a contact imaging process? One man’s perfection is another’s imperfection. Superficiality? It was not superficiality at thread level that I had in mind. It’s easy to demonstrate that kind of superficiality experimentally by visibly scorching one side of a single thread, as I have done, then ‘unspinning’ to find that most fibres are unscorched. No, it was superficiality at the fibre level I had in mind, notably the claim that the image resides on the top 200nm only (or in some versions 200 600nm). . Where’s the positive evidence for that, more specifically precise numerical data, as distinct from Rogers’ ‘”guesstimate”? The latter you will recall was less than impressive, being based on an inability to discern the image layer in cross section under a light microscope, then proceeding to assign a maximum wavelength shorter than the smallest wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Do you consider that constitutes hard data? I don’t. I consider the degree of superficiality of the visible TS image to be unknown, and even if we knew it, that would not preclude changes to the core of the fibres that might explain their reported mechanical weakness without change in colour.

The amount of flour that attaches initially to the skin 2. The amount and/or, less importantly, the proportion, that transfers to the linen (judged by how much is still left on the skin) 3. The general look of the imprint when removed from the oven (image density, homogeneity, resemblance to template etc). 4. The general look of the final attenuated, arguably more TS like imprint after washing with soap and water. Scoring of results (somewhat subjective): Criterion 1: flour slurry>olive oil> control Criterion 2: olive oil>control>flour slurry Criterion 3: olive oil >flour slurry>control Criterion 4: flour slurry>control> olive oil (highly subjective, given they are all rather similar, though there is scarcely any fine detail of finger joints in olive oil than the other two). If one scores placings as 1 (worst) and 3 (best) then flour slurry is (3 + 1 + 2 + 3) = 9; olive oil is (2 + 3 + 3 + 1) = 9; control is (1 + 2+ 1 + 2) = 6. Summary: flour slurry and olive oil come out joint equal at 9, with control the runner up at 6. If the fresh from oven appearance were the chief criterion, then the flour slurry would be penalized, having a thick and unattractive encrustation, relative to the more attractive even granular look of the olive oil. But there’s little to choose between the final attenuated imprints (where even the control looks quite acceptable). However, based on experimenter friendliness, the flour slurry wins. Why? Because there’s the immediate favourable impression created by strong attachment of lots of flour to the skin (though substantial amounts of slurry/flour fail to transfer, which may or may not be a bad thing). Then there’s the undeniable fact that if one’s decided to use a binder, it’s marginally better to coat oneself with flour slurry than with olive oil, at least if one washes the slurry off before it has had time to set like a rock hard pasta shell. So flour slurry it is, at least for the remaining tests on whole face imprinting (which will be limited, given the heavy inroads it makes on limited supplies of hard or expensive to obtain 100% linen). The wider scientific pros and cons of introducing an external source of oil to supplement the natural oil of linen (reckoned to be about 1.5% by weight), given this investigator’s earlier admittedly speculative ideas about a possible role for oil in the half tone effect and other microscopic properties, can wait for another day. It’s the ability to imprint off full 3 D relief, relative to, say, a bas relief, that is the prime concern of the present tests, not the microscopic characteristics of the final image..","date":"2016-01-29","mins":"9:55 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/modelling-the-shroud-of-turin-with-white-flour-olive-oil-and-a-real-face-in-pictures/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Modelling the Shroud of Turin with white flour, olive oil and a real face – in pictures."},{"id":"comment-6885","author":"colin_berry","post":"That’s sheer unadulterated flimflammery and obscurantism, from start to finish, piero.

It’s analogous to pre digital photography, but as I was saying just the other day to someone on the shroudstory site, it’s possible that the two stage process could have been in operation many centuries earlier, at least in principle. Imagine someone pressing their face down into a pillow. They leave an indentation, which is a kind of negative image of sorts, but it’s faint and it’s temporary (disappearing as soon as the pillow returns to its original shape). But suppose they had first smeared their face with oil, before pressing in into the pillow. It’s a faint imprint in oil, but it’s permanent, remaining visible after the pillow has sprung back. So far we’ve achieved Stage 1 imprinting. We now want to develop the image further. If oil had been used as imprinting medium, there’s a way of doing that. One finds something that attaches preferentially to oil rather than fabric. Thinking about the way fingerprints can be revealed by dusting. One could try blowing soot (fine particles of carbon) onto the oil imprint. There’s a good chance they would stick to the oil and resist being shaken off. One has then achieved second stage development. By the same reasoning the TS image could have been produced by 1. Impaction of a flour/water paste coated human (+ blood) onto linen to leave a faint negative image. Then, Step 2, develop the image by exposing to a suitable chemical that forms a strong yellow colour with flour but not linen. Nitric acid, either as vapour or solution, fits the bill. I consider this technology to have been fully within the means of a medieval entrepreneur, especially one who had links with an alchemist and who knew the recipe for generating nitric acid (heat a mixture of Cyprus vitriol, alum and saltpetre).

(My italics) This research uses a VP 8 Image Analyzer, manufactured by Interpretation Systems Inc., with a photograph of the Shroud of Turin. The image emerging on the oscilloscope of the VP 8 shows the information embedded on the fibers of the image on the Shroud of Turin. The findings detail the pattern of the discolored fibers that show wounds of a spear entrance and exit point and other marks of a man who died by crucifixion. The unique feature is the 3 D appearance from the 2 D photograph of the Shroud of Turin. No other photograph shows this characteristic.

So it’s just possible (just!) that one gets different results with the VP 8. But I doubt it somehow. That being the case it’s time to confront head on what I regard as major disinformation regarding the “uniqueness” of the Shroud image, relative to other photographs (taking that term in its widest sense to mean photographs of real anatomy or IMPRINTS thereof).

Photograph of human anatomy in natural or artificial light versus imprints thereof – testing both positive AND tone reversed negative – and: 2. Elevation mode in Image J, i.e. Whether one promotes the darkest or lightest parts of the image.

Naturally, one has to accept the Shroud body image as an imprint – not a protophotograph. Frankly I consider that a head to head image of a man’s body – frontal and dorsal can be nothing but an imprint , unless proved conclusively otherwise with conventional physics and chemistry.

He proposed that the kind of ochre (red brown ferric oxide, Fe2 O3, available in medieval times, made by decomposing green vitriol, hydrated ferrous sulphate, Fe SO4. 7 H2 O), would have contained acidic impurities, notably sulphuric acid, which becomes conc H2 SO4 when one drives off water. He reckoned that the acidic ochre was used to produce a negative image from a human subject, and the linen then heated in an air oven to make it seem older than it really was. But the heat might also have caused the acidic impurities to chemically etch the linen, via the same kind of pyrolytic chemistry (dehydration reactions etc) that occurs when linen is scorched directly with a hot metal template. Later the solid ochre flaked off, or was scrubbed off, leaving just the ghostly image (Hugh Farey has also flagged up this kind of erosion scenario as a possible explanation). In other words, there’s a mechanistic spectrum that runs between a purely thermal action (scorching from a hot template) or a chemical mechanism (traces of sulphuric acid etc) or any number of in between mechanisms that rely on a combination of chemistry and heat. Despite these uncertainties re precise mechanism, the narrative may hinge on the credibility or otherwise of a medieval artisan asking himself a simple question: “How can I produce a whole body version of the Veil? How can I simulate a post Criucifixion sweat imprint that might be left on linen as a yellow discoloration?” It didn’t need to be a real sweat imprint – merely a yellow brown image that could be represented as an ancient degraded sweat image. My own preferred scenario is that of a post 1314 scorch imprint designed to simulate a slow roasted Knight Templar, possibly a Knight Templar (Jacques de Molay?) being “reinvented” as a sweat imprint of the crucified Jesus..","date":"2014-07-17","mins":"3:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

Let’s agree that we’re still on the same wavelength, even if it’s the heat rather than light end of the em spectrum. I’m wondering how you can be so certain about spotting when a particular tone reversed image such as Secondo Pia’s is that of a real person, as distinct from being template derived. How can you be so certain? Have there been systematic studies in which respondents are asked to judge which is real, which isn’t? I doubt it. In fact there’s a paucity of studies generally on the result of imprinting off templates and comparing the image and original. In fact, there are some very life like looking bronzes, if you allow for the fact that the eye can generally distinguish between stone, bronze and skin in a straight photograph. But that distinction is lost if you start with a template with smooth surface texture (“skin”), take an imprint and then invert the tones. The real test, at least where the head is concerned is the “hair”. If you look at a good statue, like Michelangelo’s David, it’s quite life like, even in stone, except for the eyes (obviously) but also the hair, which looks too coarse and braided, and that defect would be carried through to any 2 D imprint. But the TS man’s hair is indistinguishable from skin if one simply compares the two in postage stamp sized areas (we only perceive it as “hair” by its overall distribution, framing the head, not its surface texture.). So a forger would not need to start with a template that tried to make hair look strand like, so making his task easier. Eyes too – one would not attempt to model open eyes, and again the TS image gives an appearance (probably illusory) that the eyes are oh so conveniently closed. I’m fairly confident, simply from experimenting with hot brass scorches on linen, that it would not be too difficult to produce a scorch imprint that, after tone reversal, you’d find difficult to distinguish from a real person, except maybe for it having an other wordly serene and ghostly appearance. (Yes, don’t forget the apparent luminosity that one does not expect of, say, Michelangelo’s David, but works the other way, favouring authenticity, when judging whether Secondo Pia’s image is that of Jesus, especially if it were viewed as a selfie captured at the instant of Resurrection as some would have us believe)..","date":"2014-07-27","mins":"7:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

It’s thought without observation that characterized the vacuous philosophical discourse re the natural world prior to the arrival of true experimental scientists like those who founded England’s Royal Society (Newton, Hooke, Boyle etc etc). Enough of that. Back to the matter in question. It would take too long to address all the evidence for a link between the Lirey Shroud and the Templars right now, under this somewhat inauspicious blog posting. It has been the subject of several blog postings on my dormant Word Press site, receiving scarcely a mention here.

I’ve been at it for some two years, but only recently, after experimentation with different types of heat scorch (contact, radiation) have the pieces of the jigsaw begun to assemble into some kind of pattern. Briefly, here'[s the current working hypothesis: Jacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Knights Templar and his closest associates, e.g. Geoffroi de Charney, were all slow roasted on the same day in Paris 1314. The method of execution closely mirrored that of the martyred St. Lawrence, for which there is much very Shroud like devotional artwork showing a naked or near naked man forced down onto a grid iron. The surviving Templars wanted to create a tribute or memorial, and having an existing penchant for images on cloth (see Barbara Frale’s finding in the Vatican secret archive) decided to scorch a double front and back image onto linen, as if a ‘hot Templar’ had been wrapped in a shroud. But what to use as a hot template? Here’s where the ambiguity began – they chose a recycled bronze of the crucified Christ, i.e. A life sized crucifix, which was heated and then had linen pressed against it, with damp overlay, to leave a faint, superficial NEGATIVE image. Maybe they thought that no one would be able to say, looking at a light/dark reversed negative:”Hey that’s Jesus”. Or maybe they wanted folk to make a connection with Jesus, or maybe St.Lawrence. A few decades later, that shroud is now in the hands of the Lord of Lirey, one Geoffroi de Charny, probably de Charney’s nephew (see above) and the possibilities were quickly spotted and realized for morphing the scorched on image with that of the crucified Jesus. The rest as they say is history. More?

It cannot be assumed a priori to be a valid model, and indeed it is biased in favour of authenticity from the word go. If your starting point is unbiased (or biased in favour of the radiocarbon dating) and you take as axiomatic that a decent and fairly complete imprint off a 3 D subject requires not just contact between subject and cloth but contact under pressure, to ensure optimal imprinting of relief, then your model has to consider the ways in which pressure can be applied. In fact there are two main ones: linen underneath the template, with pressure applied from above, and linen on top of template, with manual moulding of fabric to relief. It is then the task of the modeller to scrutinize the TS image closely, and attempt to deduce which of those configurations best fits the facts. The degree of tenting (short cutting) of fabric between prominences is a major diagnostic feature. Other things being equal, one expects more tenting if a template is pressed down into linen. There is indeed evidence of tenting, especially between crossed hands and abdomen, as judged by the lack of imaging around the hands. So who is right: Prof Fanti, who says the imaging is OK on the belly, and would presumably subscribe to that plucked from the air 3 4 cm allowable air gap, or this blogger who says the evidence from the lack of imaging alone in that region is fully consistent with a contact only model? The clincher for me is the ability to model the peculiar hands with bony seemingly separated fingers and no thumbs by pressing one’s Nutella coated hand (fingers touching, no gaps) down onto linen. The thumb cannot be imaged, and tenting of linen between fingers plus bony centres results in the peculiar imaging (the subject of so much wacky experimentation, like medics self administering radio technetium to test for “x ray type imaging” (see those heroic experiments by August Accetti). I am now entirely convinced that the contact model fits far too many assorted facts to be untrue, and I never had much time anyway for radiation theories that allow imaging across air gaps. Where’s the supporting physics as distinct from qualifying assumptions, like the 3 4cm air gap), read fudge factors? Which type of radiation is operating? Where are the model images, comparable to those one can produce by contact scorching? Why is there always a deafening silence when one poses these questions?

Let’s focus on the most crucial aspect, namely that “permissible” 3 4 cm air gap, routinely conjured up, at least on the internet, like a Hogwarts magical spell (or missile deflecting force field if your prefer Star Wars to Harry Potter). At least you agree that there’s a non imaged zone around the hands (Giulio Fanti please note) but then you qualify that by saying, in effect “Ah, but it’s not very wide, and there’s still some belly visible”. In my book, not written by J.K.Rowling, if there’s no contact, then there’s no imaging. That’s the uncompromising contact model of image imprinting, the one I am defending against proposed (or more generally assumed) magical mystery radiation imaging. Note the self denying ordinance. Defending the contact image model requires far greater self discipline than the oh so malleable radiation model, one that self indulgently allows imaging in expected non contact zones provided the air gaps don’t exceed the generously provisioned 3 4 cm air gap. OK, so that forces me to confine attention to locations where any air gap is expected to be less than the pseudo scientific 3 4cm fudge factor. But if one sees failure to image, no matter how restricted the zone, then that’s it for the radiationist school of thought, correction, fantasizing. Puff of white smoke – gone.

Should I expect a similar non contact zone fringing them? What’s more, although the bony fingers are evident, the space between them is the same colour as the thigh they overlie, not the background colour of the cloth. How do we think that discoloration occurred?” Hugh, in posing these entirely reasonable questions, which may or may not have a satisfactory answer, you are attempting to put the contact imprint model on the spot. Fair enough. I’ve been fielding objections to the so called scorch hypothesis for some 30 months, and invariably find they are based on pure supposition and dare I say deep seated prejudice, rather than systematic experimentation with model scorches, properly designed to eliminate bias (TH please note). But today, the boot is on the other foot. I am pointing to a zone where one hand abuts on the other, and challenging the radiationists to explain why it’s not imaged in their model. The maximum height difference between one of my own hands placed on top of the other is certainly no more than 4cm, and the average difference is 3cm or less. So that the “no imaging for air gaps greater than 3 4 cm” rule, which I have to say I regard as highly self serving and unscientific, simply cannot be used to explain the (relative) absence of imaging. As I say, today is the day for for the proponents of radiation to explain absence of imaging, at the chosen locale relative to immediate surrounds, where imaging would be predicted. Today is not the day to be telling me that there’s maybe still a bit of imaging, relative to reference points elsewhere. It’s all to do with the major differences to be expected between one model and another, as a necessary prelude to scientific shortlisting of priorities and rational choice of future research direction. Let’s not get too bogged down in the minutiae at this stage.There’s a time and a place for everything. Now is the time to look at the big picture. PS: Remember the conversation we had on my site a while ago, Hugh, on discoloration of linen in convection ovens at temperatures below those that cause immediate scorching? I suspect that some of your questions are answered by considering the diffuse browning action of hot air, temporarily confined between template and linen, the precise amount varying in different imprinting scenarios. Note that Luigi Garlaschelli used an air oven to accelerate background discoloration (artificial “ageing”) as well as assist the chemical etching action on linen fibres with his acid contaminated ochre made with medieval technology (calcining of green vitriol). Convection currents carry far more joules of thermal energy per unit time than radiation across air gaps, due to the mass as well as temperature term in transported heat. You as a physics teacher will know that (though I suspect that lay folk know that instinctively too, from oven baking at home gently and thoroughly in the convected hot air setting, not radiation mode from red hot elements.)..","date":"2014-07-20","mins":"2:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

One would paint one’s face etc with flour paste, sprinkle on the dry flour, going around the painted area with a damp cloth, taking off the mix where one wants no imprinting (sides of face, sides of nose etc). One then imprints, hoping that the overlay of dry flour will be sufficient to give the desired fuzziness, while the underlying paste will have done its job in giving a good base to which the flour sticks, but not too strongly so as to prevent its transfer to linen.

Out of interest, since when has John Jackson been talking about convection, rather than radiation attenuation? What one needs to do is locate a part of the image where the expected cloth body distance is 1cm or less. If there’s still weak or essentially no imaging, then it’s striking confirmation of contact only imprinting, and curtains for radiation/convection models that allow an air gap. There is indeed just such a location on the TS that provides the crucial sub 1cm test. What’s more, it’s in my ‘Nutellograph” above (a handy term plagiarized from the site’s host, one who can never be accused of taking my ideas too seriously).

Thank you Would you concur that – at least theoretically – the image could also be explained by a miraculous contact process at resurrection? Dunno. At the risk of appearing evasive, I admit to some difficulty with a sentence that has the words “theoretically” and “miraculous” so close together. Oxymoronic? Because I still have a few problems with a medieval artisan theory, including: – “Sweat mimicking” – as far as I know the “sweat image” of history related to the face, not the whole body. Yes, it was an audacious idea on someone’s part to eclipse the then crowd drawing Veil of Veronica with something bigger and better. But the marketing instincts were sound, enlarging (literally) on an existing idea, since that ambitious quantum leap was finally able to win public acceptance (despite opposition from the indignant local bishop etc). Who’s to say that the ‘sweat imprint’ idea was not just an intermediate one, with a newer ‘resurrection imprint’ narrative gradually taking its place? The latter could have been a defensive ploy too (to prevent imitations popping up everywhere, given there can only be one Resurrection, and thus only one genuine Shroud). The buttocks! This still does not make sense to me in terms of medieval sensibility, with the VAST MAJORITY of historical imagery protecting Christ’s modesty with loin cloth. I realize there is the odd depiction of a fully nude Jesus, but a nude Jesus depicted in a manuscript (always with hands protecting modesty and no buttocks on display) is entirely different to a nude human size Jesus depicted for public showing! I’m not sure that a putative “sweat imprint” of a naked man on linen, a negative faint and fuzzy one at that, would have been viewed in quite the same way as one painted with dense pigment on canvas especially when only on temporary fleeting display. Besides, being an image on a burial shroud, it would remind pilgrims of the state in which all of them enter and finally exit the world, being another factor helping to suppress usual sensibilities. Sudden thought: might the impressive number of scourge marks, 372 in all we are told, distributed over most of the body, buttocks included, be said to have served a kind of ‘clothing’ effect? Maybe their masking action helped prevent elderly spinster ladies from going into a swoon.

I’ve been having a re read of Luigi Garlaschelli’s paper, which I initially found a bit off putting for reasons that now look somewhat trivial. In fact there’s a lot of very good science there, tucked away among all the arts and crafts detail. Note that while he used real subjects from which to obtain his powder imprints, subsequently baked in an oven to get chemical etching, he was forced to use a bas relief template for the head. That he says was made from Plaster of Paris (it would have been nice to have seen a photograph, if only to have judged the fairness or otherwise of Thibault Heimburger’s critique re inferior 3 D ness). I had previously described two ways of getting a thermal imprint onto linen – one from a charcoal drawing with “thermostencilling” using radiant heat, selectively absorbed by the carbon, and a second by direct contact imprinting – hot metal or maybe ceramic onto cloth (“simple scorch”). But the more I think about it, the more I consider that Luigi’s indirect method, with cold powder imprinting (“frottage”) followed crucially by baking, is the more likely “forger’s” technology, producing a fuzzier end product, but surprisingly by employing what was probably in essence the same carbohydrate dehydration chemistry.

You see, after steeping cotton overnight in diluted alkali, there is now an amazing difference in ‘scorchability’ – the untreated cotton being black, and the treated being a faint tan. Sadly for shroudology (or fortuitously for some) linen is not cotton, and behaves very differently. First it is far less prone to scorching, and secondly there is scarcely any difference between alkali treated and control (there’s a little, as per prediction, but not nearly enough upon which to build a case). I have now emptied undiluted oven cleaner onto linen in an attempt to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. I’ll test half of the fabric this evening.

While I’m in sloshing chemical mode, it occurs to me that lignin can be dissolved out with metabisulphites, as per paper industry, and that the Campden tablets one uses in wine making as a disinfectant are mainly sodium metabisulphite.

Fact: one can dunk linen in undiluted oven cleaner (“5 15% sodium hydroxide”) for several hours and it has scarcely any effect on its ability to take a scorch (whereas that of cotton is clobbered by the same treatment).

I steeped linen yesterday in strong metabisulphite solution, said to dissolve lignin, but there was no effect on “scorchability”. So what does that leave? Answer – amorphous cellulose, i.e. Cellulose that is NOT part of highly crystalline arrays. That is a description of cellulose in the PCW and perhaps a few regions of the SCW also, and importantly, while more ready to dehydrate and scorch, it may still be chemically resistant to alkali. Then I suddenly remembered a posting I did months ago: linen fibre nodes are where one sees most of the colour in the scorched fabric under the microscope.

I’m somewhat puzzled by your comment “we need not go exclusively to the nodes”. When one looks at fibres from the faintest scorch imprints on linen, most of the brown colour is at the nodes, though granted there is a faint yellow coloration on the rest of the fibre. Aren’t those nodes the place to focus on, given the faintness of the Shroud image? There seems to be little info (or interest) in the literature on the precise function of those nodes, but one possibility is that they provide a little give to the stem fibres of the flax plant through having tiny non crystalline regions that act like slightly flexible kinks. I’m presently wondering of that amorphous cellulose is PCW, SCW or both, and trying to fit that to the subtle properties of the Shroud image (360 degree encirclement of the fibre of imprinted regions, half tone, striations, superficiality etc). But this could all be a waste of time if the nodal location of image pigment does not show up on the Shroud.

Re claims for the TS having a generally authentic look, he writes: 1. To satisfy the growing curiosity about the puzzling cloth, a first committee of neutral museum experts, art scholars, and forensic test specialists was appointed in 1973 by Cardinal Pellegrino. Art historians were sceptical as to the antiquity of the cloth and were rather inclined to see it as a late medieval work. 2. Re the STURP findings : The image of the Shroud is very faint … and can be discerned by the naked eye only from a couple of meters away. 3. The image contains some 3 D information. …. The image seems to.lack the wrap around lateral distortions that are to be expected from any likely interaction between a human shape and a cloth. The image has been called an orthogonal projection of a body onto a surface. (my aside: too good to be true, unless miraculously projected, but if the latter then “anatomical accuracy” becomes meaningless in a scientific sense). …Many submicron sized particles of red ochre were found only in the image area and in the blood stains. Although the lack of historical records , the artist’s confession reported in the 1389 memorandum, and the results of the C 14 dating all seem to rule out the possibility that the TS is the actual burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth, this hypothesis might still apply to a 14th century artifact obtained by wrapping the corpse of a crucified man. These hypotheses imply contact between the body and the cloth and some form of material transfer between them. Further objections to the hypothesis that the Shroud is not an artifact are of course possible: for example it is a physical impossibility for blood oozing from the scalp to flow at the outer surface of the hair. Instead the whole hair mass should be matted and smeared. Moreover long hair should fall down at the sides of the face and could not possibly leave the kind of imprint one can see in the Shroud. … a general weakness of most of the attempts to reproduce the Shroud is that they try to generate an image as we see it today, i.e. Extremely faint. We believe it much more likely that an artist would have preferred to create a clearly visible picture for the veneration of worshipers. In other words we must take into account the possibility that the original image has slowly faded during the (at least) 650 years of its existence. (Me again: as for claims for anatomical perfection): : “…the accuracy of the anatomy of the Man of the Shroud has been debated many times. Some researchers consider it perfect and flawless, others think it looks unnatural. According to Frederick Zugibe, it may even show evidence that Jesus suffered from Marfan’s Syndrome, a rare hereditary disease having among its symptoms elongated limbs, long spidery fingers and a long thin face. Since the image is fuzzy and ruined by burns, it is very doubtful whether accurate anthropometric measurements are possible (for example, in the front image the feet do not even show)… So what price that so called anatomical perfection (“accurate to extremely minute details”)? Since when has proposed Marfan’s syndrome been the sine qua non for anatomical perfection?.","date":"2013-10-28","mins":"9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/28/of-those-big-meaning-words-superficial-half-tone-and-striated/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of those big-meaning words: Superficial, half-tone and striated"},{"id":"comment-49117","author":"colin_berry","post":"Progress report: 1. As predicted, cotton fabrics give a far more intense scorch than linen, when the two are overlapped and imprinted with the same hot template spanning the two.

I have come across a very recent paper (2011) that describes in detail how hemicelluloses, pectins etc can be simply removed from flax fibres using dilute caustic alkali (Na OH). Http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijps/2011/503940/ The paper shows photomicrographs before and after, suggesting strongly that it is an outer flaky coating that is removed by alkali leaving a smooth core. (There may even be those ribs in the schematic diagram above, using the eye of faith). Could it be that a simple steeping in alkali is all that will be needed to leave a chemically stripped linen that will then resist being scorched?

Yes. I had missed earlier links to your article, Charles, so did not get to read it until a few hours ago, and then posted first thoughts. I had thought of deploying the term “Options” as in Option 1 (1st century imprinting, whether by magical radiation or Rogers’ ‘naturalistic’ mechanism) versus Option 2 (medieval painting), but decided on “contest” instead, given there’s always a polarization of views in shroudology, rather than mere choices. “Options, “contest”, “competition”, whichever term one uses should not prevent any of us from making a cool and rational assessment of the available evidence and arriving at our own judgement as to where the truth lies, based on a balance of probabilities and that indefinable thing called gut feeling. My chief reservation with your analysis is not to do with the chronology, placing the TS in the medieval era. It’s your thesis that it’s a product of its time, entirely explicable by the artistic conventions of the era. I believe the TS to be a one off, but stand to be corrected. Are you aware of any other images with its peculiar properties, notably the negative ‘photographic’ character. Can you name any other image in which the aim has been to depict an imprint, as left by a figure on both frontal and dorsal contact sides of a burial shroud that has been PAINTED? I can’t, but then I’m not an art historian. But if, as I believe, the artisan(s) (NOT artist) who produced the TS deployed an entirely novel, one off imprinting technology that did not use paint but which modified the fabric itself chemically, or some exceedingly thin surface coating, then I hardly think the TS was produced simply for dramatic effect for an Easter ritual, given there was no compelling need that I can see to show ANY image whatsoever on the shroud. Brand new technology? When it’s entirely divorced from the conventions of extant art or even crafts,when we struggle to comprehend the physics and chemistry even now, centuries later, then that says to me there must have been a far more compelling reason on someone’s part to invest time, energy and expenditure in so ambitious an undertaking. But what? It’s claimed that Geoffroi de Charny was nephew of Geoffroi de Charney, Knight Templar, Preceptor of Normandy, who was roasted alive alongside Jacques de Molay, Templar Grand Master, Paris 1314. “Roasted” note. It’s a long shot I know, but there’s another hypothesis there if the TS image is indeed as I suspect some kind of thermal imprint. Visual metaphor? The slow grill equivalent of gallows humour?

You seem to have taken me too literally Louis. I wasn’t suggesting for one moment that STURP’s dehydrated carbohydrates represented real paint. I was merely responding to your term “hot paint”.which I took to be a metaphor. One can think of Irene Corgiat as applying “hot paint” when she scorched a look alike image of the TS onto linen using her pyrographic tool (similar to an electrician’s hot soldering iron), the colour being entirely due to chemical pyrolysis of the linen’s own carbohydrates. I personally do not buy into any suggestion that the image was originally applied pigment that subsequently ALL detached, leaving some kind if visible but unspecified signature. Even if that had happened it would be unscientific to push that as a probable scenario. To be scientific there would need to be evidence of at least some remaining pigment, sufficient for chemical characterization. Excluding the problematic traces of iron oxide or mercuric sulphide claimed by Walter Mc Crone that don’t square with the reflectance spectroscopy (dehydrated carbohydrates) except by invoking a Joe Nickell/Luigi Garlaschelli scenario (chemically induced dehydration due to H2 SO4 impurity in medieval ochre – ingenious but otherwise unsupported) there’s not a shred of hard evidence for any kind of real, non metaphorical “paint”. The logical next stage in model building has to be a “scorch” hypothesis, not necessarily a contact scorch (my own preference). Even Di Lazzaro’s laser beams produced what might legitimately be described as a scorch. “Scorch” should be seen as any coloration produced from the linen carbohydrates per se as a consequence of chemical changes that lead to loss of the elements of water (2 H per O atom) with the production of yellow chromophores with conjugated double bonds ( C=C C=C ) with their extended delocalised system of pi bonding electrons..","date":"2014-11-02","mins":"6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/02/paper-chase-a-significant-paper-by-mario-latendresse/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase:  A Significant Paper by Mario Latendresse"},{"id":"comment-48894","author":"colin_berry","post":"Here is why you must read the (Rogers’) paper: “I believe that a combination of relatively rapidly decomposing impurities on the surface of the cloth with transfer/diffusion of catalytic compounds from a body, as discussed by Pellicori, could explain the observations on the chemistry and appearance of the image on the Shroud. It should explain the shallow penetration of the image, the fact that the color did not penetrate more deeply at presumed contact points, its “half tone” appearance, and its predominantly discontinuous distribution.” Yes, but with all due respect to a gifted chemist sadly no longer with us, Raymond Rogers seems to have had little or no understanding of the flax/linen surface onto which the superficial Shroud image was imprinted, whether by natural processes, or miraculously or by forgers. He describes the hemicelluloses of linen as an “impurity”, despite being an intrinsic and major component of the superficial primary cell wall (PCW), and then substitutes that conjectural man made impurity coating (starch, saponins etc) onto which the Shroud image was imprinted. All of this I have said on numerous previous occasions. The reason for posting this comment is to provide a link to a schematic diagram of the PCW I have just come across, one that shows some fascinating detail (caveat: possibly conjectural) re the relationship between the chemically reactive hemicellulose (shown in blue) and the underlying cellulose fibrils. Note the way that the hemicellulose forms a series of interrupted striations on the surface of the cellulose fibrils. Then imagine an image being thermochemically imprinted by some means onto that surface. It is not difficult to see how the resulting image might exhibit both half tone character AND striations as reported per Shroud image if there were selective pyrolysis (chemical dehydration to yellow or tan products) of those interrupted hemicellulose bands or segments, leaving the cellulose relatively intact. It may be time to restart those kitchen experiments. It could start with attempts to strip off the outermost PCW layer of cells selectively, or even the hemicelluloses only, and see whether the surface then resists thermochemical dehydration (aka “scorching” ; ). Strategies? There are physical means, e.g. Stripping with adhesive tape, freeze thaw cycles, or possibly chemical ones too, though I don’t under estimate the difficulties. It will be interesting to compare linen with cotton, since one might anticipate some differences (the linen PCW has only to make contact with other internal cells of stem’s bast fibres, so can/may be somewhat fragile, while the cotton PCW on those hairy seed bolls is in direct contact with outside air, so might need to be thicker and more robust, easier to see and possibly imprint, but harder to strip off). In the longer term, it might be interesting to see whether those hemicellulose segments, if disposed as per diagram, can be selectively stained histochemically, and detected (if present) under light microscopy of flax/linen fibres, and compared with high magnification/HD photographs of the Shroud fibres. Does anyone know if the latter are available, and/or whether they show a striation pattern comparable to the hemicellulose in that schematic diagram?.","date":"2013-10-27","mins":"9:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/01/paper-chase-an-alternate-hypothesis-for-the-image-color/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase:  An Alternate Hypothesis for the Image Color"},{"id":"comment-37963","author":"colin_berry","post":"“Professor” is not a valid title to be used on this site, as (when challenged) you gave a link to a poster presentation at that Polish Shroudie congress that described you as “Professor, Dr. Max Patrick Hamon”.

A Happy New Year to you and your family. Thanks for tracking down the range of wavelengths used in the 1978 work. Yes they are broadly similar to those in the typical bank note detector, though having a somewhat greater output in the shorter range of wavelength (335 350nm). The only reason i can think for Hugh seeing fluorescence is to do with the source of lamp. I get the impression that Hugh’s 150 W source (!) is a modified tungsten lamp, one that takes a while to get up to maximum temperature, probably radiating progressively more UV B as it does so. Mine uses a small coated fluorescent tube, a mere 4 watts. Why should the margins of the TS burn holes fluoresce red? One can only speculate, but I suspect it’s to do with the chemistry of partial carbonization that occurs at much higher temperatures than my typical oven temperatures of 200 250 degrees C.The elemental carbon in charred organic material is said to have a graphite like structure of fused benzene rings. The latter is formed by condensation/polymerization of low molecular aromatic monomers (benzenoid precursors). I suspect that its those precursors that do not fully polymerize to elemental carbon, maybe becoming PAH (polycyclic aromatic carbons), similar to naphthalene, anthracene etc that are responsible for the pink or red fluorescence , but I’m open to other suggestions.

Answer: they decolorize completely when treated with domestic bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Elemental carbon cannot be bleached.

It’s quite difficult to get rid of the thick encrusted material in the final soap washing stage.

Maybe there were alternatives in the medieval period, equally good for image making, but easier to attenuate in the final washing stage to get that iconic faint and ghostly image.

That’s not the same as saying that all scorch marks are non fluorescing, which in turn raises all sorts of unresolved questions re the nature of the fluorophore(s), and whether pyrolysis, i.e. Heating under conditions that restrict oxygen access, e.g. A closed silver reliquary, would generate fluorophores more readily than if the roasted carbohydrates had free access to abundant oxygen. (There are good theoretical grounds for thinking that may well be the case, to do with the creation of conjugated diene systems and extensive pi bond delocalised systems, especially with aromatic ring systems – ones that favour fluorescence when there is no oxygen to sequester the surplus electrons from pyrolytic C H, O H bond fission etc. I have every right to promote my own site – how else do you think that blogs become visible when there are millions of them out there?

I won’t say much more on the subject, at least not here. Suffice it to say that the desrciption of the computerisied anthropometric study of Fanti et al as “real scientific work” is comedic, as is the paper itself. Nowhere does that paper consider the sceptics’ view that the image was produced from an inanimate replica. E.g. A bas relief or statue. Instead it makes numerous explicit assumptions that it was a body that had been taken down from a cross in a state of rigor mortis with head tipped forward, knees drawn up, that an image had been acquired on a cloth that was loosely draped over etc. Talk about self serving assumptions – ones that make that final diagram of the two “supeimposable” (sic)outlines totally at odds with unaided, non messed around with simple observation, e.g. Link to non computer transformed dorsal v frontal comparison Note too they say “superimposable”, not “superimposed” – a crucial difference, and then refer to “compatible”, a term that is shot through with subjectivity. Nowhere does the paper say how the image was formed from a real person on that draped over cloth, especially those parts not in direct contact with the cloth. What a worthless publication – the referees should have thrown it straight back, or better still in the bin… I am only too painfully aware, needless to say, that the icy cold objectivity of (real) science is not for everyone (present company excepted ; ) and that would include those so called scientists who use computer aided (re )imaging systems in an attempt to escape the evidence of their own eyes, to say nothing of common sense… The clue to the artefact – a term I use deliberately lies I believe in those (over)long bony fingers, says he with a gleam in his eye, which I intend to put up for discussion shortly.

I then chose a vertical line of bisection approximately midway between the ventral and dorsal heads, i.e. The image free zone. One half I rotated through180 degrees, and then cut and pasted above the other half. The editing software placed the two feet ends together (IT WAS NOT ME THAT MADE THAT DECISION) I looked at the result to decide if it was biased or not. The triangular burn marks were certainly not in alignment (no reason why they should be of course given that each layer of linen burns differently), but the burn marks were LOWER on the dorsal side, whereas the head and thus apparent length/height was GREATER on the dorsal side. Had I shifted the dorsal side higher to get the burn marks in better alignment, the dorsal head would have looked EVEN HIGHER than I showed. In other words, any bias was AGAINST the point I was making. Later, after the dressing down from Miss, I went back to Google images, and found someone who had done my exercise, but with clearer images which showed the different sets of “poker holes” (see my site for the link). Those holes were in near perfect alignment, both the set at the very top and another lower down. In other words, if I am being charged with deliberately misaligning in order to manufacture the appearance of a disparity in size, then there is no case to answer. Given that one of the “must read” references we were given earlier today starts by stating categorically that the dorsal image is 7 cm longer/taller than the ventral, and given that I merely suggested on the basis of my own “playing with the laptop” (my very words), and that I could hardly have done more to hedge my words, then I frankly consider this inquisition bang out of order.

Here’s the link So, in other words, while the orientation of the feet would be problematical if one were trying to align those front and rear, the feet become irrelevant if one takes the poker holes as one’s unambiguous reference points.

Think of the poker holes like a belt.

I am anti the phoney science that is used either to promote religion or to belittle science (i.e a single OR twin agenda). What makes the TS so potent a symbol is that the TWIN agenda does indeed appear to be operating. The scales fell from my eyes when reading the email correspondence between Paolo Di Lazzaro and Tom Chivers back in December 2012, with the first of those prefacing his remarks with “speaking as a scientist” and then proceeding to drive a coach and horses through all the precepts of science I learned at school and University. Any charitable doubts I may have had re our friend Paolo were dispelled when he came onto this site to relate his “clincher” hot coin experiment, which he accompanied with a woefully naive lecture on radiation physics, one that displayed a total blind spot for the First Law of Photochemistry (“no nett absorption, no chemical reaction”) and then went on to imply that microscopic complexity requires divine intervention. (Does God have to be in attendance each time it snows?) You just can’t get the physicists these days (i.e. Ones prepared to learn a little chemistry, about spontaneous molecular self organization that results in microscopic complexity). One cannot begin to understand the natural word, far less induced man made physical or chemical changes, if one has no understanding of molecular self organization that needs no divine entity in constant attendance. Spontaneous change with isolated pockets of organization at both microscopic and macroscopic levels is what links the TS image with mountain building. Those here with a little scientific background will now that is free energy, a composite of enthalpy and entropy terms with a crucial temperature factor that is the driving force for thermodynamically feasible processes, with an additional temperature factor being needed in the real world as a kinetic kick start (the Arrhenius ‘energy of activation’). Anybody wishing to research the TS image would be well advised to brush up on both chemical thermodynamics and kinetics before going to press with their first press release (or pdf). BOTH are needed if one’s to understand why some reactions are easier to initiate than others, but also why some, once started are runaway, while OTHERS ARE NOT, usually as a consequence of an absorption or dissipation of thermal energy. Both scorching of linen and mountain building are heat driven processes. Both are self limiting, due to absorption or dissipation of that vital input of heat and, more importantly, the associated temperature change. But then I’m sure I don’t need to tell an engineer the difference between heat (an extensive property) and temperature (an intensive one), risking the charge of having set up a straw man argument. Wouldn’t want to do that now, would we?.","date":"2014-08-18","mins":"2:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/scorched-by-god-a-hymn-for-this-sunday/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorched by God?

How can you account for these biological stains that are a sure proof that the Shroud is a real burial cloth of a real scourged and crucified man?” Adler was a clever man, maybe too clever when he tried to kill two birds with one stone – i.e. To explain away the absence of red blood cells and potassium AND the ability of dried clotted blood to transfer so efficiently behaving for all the world as though it were freshly shed blood. So we have his “serum exudate from retracted blood clots” story which frankly I consider scarcely credible. Close scrutiny of the Durante 2002 HD images (Shroud Scope) suggests the red stains are far closer in their appearance to blood than to serum (and strangely gooey blood at that). They seem far too intensely pigmented and localised to be serum, or even serum from partially lysed red blood cells. The serum idea was essentially an hypothesis, not fact, so it was a huge liberty indeed unscientific, to go substituting the term “serum” for blood. So when Adler and Heller did their experiments with ‘serum coated fibres’, adding pronase enzyme, and concluding that the “blood arrived first”, ahead of the image, one is entitled to ask precisely what was done, what was seen, what could be safely concluded, if anything Did they use red coloured fibres with concentrated haemoglobin – recognizable as “blood”? Or were they content to use fibres that were paler in colour, more “serum like”, whatever that means in the context of the Shroud? How can their descriptions make any sense when the semantics are so compromised and uncertain? Then there’s the small matter of Adler and Heller having strangely failed to accompany the STURP team to Turin in ’78, so never getting to see the Shroud and its bloodstains with their own eyes. But you could be forgiven for not appreciating that when you see their tabulations of different stained fibres and blood flakes as if seen in situ. Personally, I don’t set much store by anything from Adler and Heller – there’s simply too much mixing together of fact and hypothesis, too many liberties with terminology. You can never be sure what’s real, and what’s been assumed or even imagined. (And that’s without mentioning the bizarre ‘bilirubin story’) So that crucial blood first dogma of theirs needs to be checked out thoroughly.

But it IS science, since the ideas re imaging and blood are both testable, at least in principle. Life size scorchable statues? All in good time, but there is little incentive to go scaling up when one’s findings with small scale models are totally ignored or dismissed, sometimes on the basis of rigged or clumsy experiments, designed to give the desired result, like excessive scorching, or “excessive contrast” (don’t ask!). That’s despite my scorches from sensibly selected bas relief templates with gentle gradations of relief reproducing: 1. The Shroud image’s peculiar, somehat unattractive, negative character: 2. Its dramatic response/improvement after tone inversion, accentuated no doubt by the non directional character of imprinted shadow free scorches, 3. Its ‘profoundly mysterious’ ability to respond to 3 D enhancement in programs that interpret image density as height on a third imaginary z axis, i.e. Dimension, 4. Its ability to produce mechanically weakened fibres, 5. To produce obverse side imaging if excessive temperature is employed, 6. Its ability to produce weak imaging across air gaps – probably via convection currents – unlike radiation models that simply don’t work in practice (due to boring old conventional physics that says that radiation reflects off white surfaces) Give me more time (and inclination) and the list could probably be extended. But why bother, here on this site, where it’s so much simpler and satisying for folk to win brownie points at my expense, by ridiculing or attempting to trash the science than it is to address the specific details. In fact, the only reason I’m here now, responding to the stand up comedy, is because it’s light relief from the extraordinarily hard and thankless work of trying to track down the supposed scientific basis of all the playing to the pro authenticity gallery. (All one finds, after hours of googling, is one dissolving perspective after another. But is that really so surprising, given that patient peeling away of the trappings of science rarely reveals anything of substance, merely agenda driven theofiziks, theochemystery, theofizziology, aka posturing, pretentious puffed up pseudoscience). Blood leeches? Here’s what said to a regular on my own site – just this morning: “That’s why my narrative has been so consistent and unchanging over the months – not because I am unwilling to change my views, but because my ideas have already gone through a long process of critical reflection before they ever appear on this site, and even the ‘wackier’ ones like leech blood can account for several otherwise explained oddities re Shroud blood (lack of potassium, atypical porphyrin, no sign of blood clots, presence of a marker for connective tissue (leech?), ability to be applied as a non coagulating paint, possible the “permanent red colour” due to exotic haem species generated from having spent weeks or months exposed to digestive juices, bacteria etc.” Haven’t we forgotten something. I have placed my head on the block here, since it’s a fairly straightforward matter to test Shroud blood for intact collagen, or antigens to the contents of a leech gut. Did Adler bother to test his wacky bilirubin narrative for the peculiar longevity of the red colour of Shroud blood? Answer on a postcard please (and be reflecting on why my blood theory gets immediate flak while the same critics remain silent of Adler’s wild authencity promoting flights of fancy that have since acquired the status of received wisdom, some might say holy writ). As for the Lirey “conspiracy”, nobody in 14th century France ever got poor from underestimating the gullibility of medieval pilgrims, the latter proto tourists desperate to visit the latest ‘holy icon’ to be ‘brought back’ from Constantinople or the Holy Land by returning Crusaders. The local bishop was not taken in, needless to say, no doubt noting the periodic “improvements” in medallions on display in the souvenir shop. Google (machy mould) for evidence for fine tuning of the authenticity message. See also this account from Ian Wilson of the Shroud’s first recorded history in the second half of the 14th century: there is plenty here to sustain a ‘conspiracy theory’ (my bolding) April 10 (or 16), 1349: The Hundred Year War had been raging between France and England for over eleven years and the Black Death had just finished ravaging most of Europe when Geoffrey de Charny, a French knight, writes to Pope Clement VI reporting his intention to build a church at Lirey, France. It is said he builds St. Mary of Lirey church to honor the Holy Trinity who answered his prayers for a miraculous escape while a prisoner of the English. He is also already in possession of the Shroud, which some believe he acquired in Constantinople. 1355: According to the “D’Arcis Memorandum”, written more than thirty years later, the first known expositions of the Shroud are held in Lirey at around this time. Large crowds of pilgrims are attracted and special souvenir medallions are struck. A unique surviving specimen can still be found today at the Cluny Museum in Paris. Reportedly, Bishop Henri refused to believe the Shroud could be genuine and ordered the expositions halted. The Shroud was then hidden away. September 19, 1356: Geoffrey de Charny is killed by the English at the Battle of Poitiers, during a last stand in which he valiantly defends his king. Within a month his widow, Jeanne de Vergy, appeals to the Regent of France to pass the financial grants, formerly made to Geoffrey, on to his son, Geoffrey II. This is approved a month later. The Shroud remains in the de Charny family’s possession. August 4, 1389: A letter signed by King Charles VI of France orders the bailiff of Troyes to seize the Shroud at Lirey and deposit it in another of Troyes’ churches pending his further decision about its disposition. August 15, 1389: The bailiff of Troyes reports that on his going to the Lirey church, the dean protested that he did not have the key to the treasury where the Shroud was kept. After a prolonged argument, the bailiff seals the treasury’s doors so that the Shroud cannot be spirited away. September 5, 1389: The king’s First Sergeant reports to the bailiff of Troyes that he has informed the dean and canons of the Lirey church that “the cloth was now verbally put into the hands of our lord the king. The decision has also been conveyed to a squire of the de Charny household for conveyance to his master”. November (?) 1389: Bishop Pierre d’Arcis of Troyes appeals to anti pope Clement VII at Avignon concerning the exhibiting of the Shroud at Lirey. He describes the cloth as bearing the double imprint of a crucified man and that it is being claimed as the true Shroud in which Jesus’ body was wrapped, attracting crowds of pilgrims. January 6, 1390: Clement VII writes to Bishop d’Arcis, ordering him to keep silent on the Shroud, under threat of excommunication. On the same date Clement writes a letter to Geoffrey II de Charny apparently restating the conditions under which expositions could be allowed. That day he also writes to other relevant individuals, asking them to ensure that his orders are obeyed. June 1390: A Papal bull grants new indulgences to those who visit St. Mary of Lirey and its relics. May 22, 1398: Death of Geoffrey II de Charny. He is buried at the Abbey of Froidmont, near Beauvais, his tomb decorated with his effigy as a knight in armour. ………………………………….. Notice anything? At no stage is there any indication that Geoffroi de Charny made any attempt himself to convince the local bishop of the Shroud’s authenticity prior to public display. Instead he left a will stating that the Shroud was to be displayed AFTER his death (putting his wife in danger?) although interestingly his widow wasted no time in acting upon her husband’s directives, and quickly running into opposition from the Church. But then there was no husband around who could be subjected to inquisition and/or torture, extracting the real story (although we are told that an unnamed artisan did confess to having forged the Shroud). There is no need to entertain conspiracy theories here – the recorded history speaks for itself. The Shroud evinced incredulity from the word go that it was or might be the genuine burial cloth of Christ, and its first recorded owner postponed display until he was safely beyond the reach of the hooded men with the hot tongs, the thumb screws, the hammered wedges, the finger/toe nail extractors, your bigger than average barbecue etc etc..","date":"2013-03-17","mins":"9:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"id":"comment-27640","author":"colin_berry","post":"While the site owner continues to allow this kind of comment I shall (yet again) absent myself..","date":"2013-03-18","mins":"9:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"id":"comment-27667","author":"colin_berry","post":"The willing suspension of disbelief is OK for those who are about to dip into a novel.

But why bother? I can think of very few occasions on this site where commentators have been willing to put aside their disdain and preconceptions long enough for anyone to calmly articulate the case for a medieval provenance. Lacking at least a temporary truce,it is well nigh impossible to focus purely on the science, even the kind of science one acquires at school, like the three methods of heat transfer, without being placed under duress. But where the science is concerned, there’s a clue: that concentrated spot of solar radiation, mainly infrared and visible white light, with a minor uv component, usually has to be focused down to the smallest possible spot a real inverted image of the Sun in fact, apparent if viewed through dark glasses, for the paper or cloth to scorch and then char or catch fire. That’s because white surfaces tend to reflect/scatter most of the incident radiation – both heat and light. Repeat the experiment with black paper or cloth, and it’s an entirely different story. With greater absorption, less scattering and reflection, there is much faster pyrolysis, or even combustion. The mechanism by which the Shroud, initially pristine white linen, acquired its negative image could NOT have involved radiation – certainly not that from radiant energy sources comparable to sunlight. Without an intense source of radiation, the kind that is emitted from an incandescent body at thousands of degrees Celsius, that leaves conduction and convection. But please don’t tell anyone I said so, at least not here, or elsewhere in the public domain. I can’t afford to be branded a pseudoscientist, not at my time of life.

But it’s entirely an accident of modern photographic inversion. Yes, I know Secondo Pia’s inversion looks too good to be an accident, but it is, and there are experiments one can do to demonstrate it is just that – a serendipitous accident. Probably few folk have ever experimented with scorches, then with charcoal or pencil drawings of those scorches (or the Shroud image) , and then photographically inverted in Image J, and then given a little 3 D enhancement. I have! Yes ,if you really want to understand the nature of the Shroud image, I urge you to repeat my experiments. The crudest, most amateur charcoal drawings, say of the Shroud face, show a near miraculous transformation. Why should that be? There are probably two main factors. The first is that light/dark reversal suppresses the harshness of one’s charcoal, relegating it to white space (similarly for the Shroud and model scorches) Conversely, what is originally white space, without harshness, become promoted to image density. Already one has a marked enhancement, a hint of that distinctive haunting quality, an ability to endow a charcoal sketch with a soft focus photographic quality – but as I say – a happy accident. A medieval artisan producing an image by scorching off a template (‘pyrography’ aka branding) could have had no inkling that an amazing and entirely fortuitous transformation would be possible with 20th century technology, There’s probably a second factor at work, a little more subtle. A scorch has no directional quality – matching a key feature of the Shroud image. That means no shadows. If one simulates that lack of directional shadowing with charcoal, the inverted image has a peculiar other worldly look about it, as well it might, since shadows are part of our real world, so its hardly surprising that photographic inversion of a shadowless image creates a unique combination of pseudo positive and lack of directionality resulting in a slightly strange and unique viewing experience. In short, one starts with a non directional negative, and converts to a similarly non directional positive, something that photographers would not normally attempt, perhaps explaining why the Shroud image is so poorly understood unless one adopts one’s own hands– a scientific stepwise approach.

When you look at the scant evidence for so called unique properties, you could understand many not bothering to rise to the challenge. I do, but not with a view to reproducing the entire image – see Luigi Garlaschelli for a creditable result (in my view) using his “frottage” technique. I’m content to use small templates that demonstrate pseudo negative image, non directionality, 3 D enhancibility in Image J, superficiality (right down to the limit of visibillity but no actual measurements – either from me or anyone else for that matter – just guesstimates). What my paltry efforts in the kitchen lack is that certain fuzziness, and according to Hugh Farey, they are fluorescent under uv and shouldn’t be, but Luigi’s tick those two boxes. I’m not sure why so many react so strongly to the term “scorch”, given that the STURP summary described the image as resembling one chemically, even if avoiding the term. The real dichotomy, read parting of the ways, is how one interprets the mechanism of image acquisition. I say that radiation is simply not credible, on a whole number of grounds, and Ray Rogers said the same.The obvious mechanism to get a negative image that lacks directionality, that does not require inventing whole new branches of physics, like self collimated radiation that defies Newton’s Inverse Square Law (or would, in a vacuum), is to imagine scorching by direct contact between a heated inanimate template (directly or indirectly modelled on a real person), possibly with some secondary effects from superheated air or steam acting across small air gaps.

You agree? Quelle horreur! I’m not sure I know how to handle agreement, Thibault. It’s so much easier to deal with polarised opposition. ; ) Here’s a hastily composed answer that attempts to address what I consider the key issues in deciding whether (a) the Shroud image has “better” 3 D ness than anything that could be produced today and (b) whether superior 3d ness, if found, is telling us anything about the mechanism by which it was formed. Here’s then is a cut and paste of what I have been busy on these last 30 minutes. ******************************************************************************** Let’s start with a proposition – that other things being equal, a negative image is a better starting point than a positive, provided it is first converted to a positive. (That may not be immediately obvious unless or until one has experimented, as I have, and shown how the crudest of charcoal drawings can give luminous ghostly end results with some of the character of the Shroud image .The transformation can be rationalized in scientific terms through realizing that tonal inversion reduces degrees of harshness to degrees of white space, and degrees of white space are conversely promoted to degrees of image intensity). Now the Shroud negative image – a good starting point in principle – could have been produced by two entirely different mechanisms that result in approximately the same end result, one by old physics (Method A), mainly by contact/conduction (my preferred scenario) and one by new physics (Method B) i.e. By collimated radiation. In both cases a nose, say, would imprint as an area of higher intensity on our negative. In Method A it’s because it’s touching the linen and scorching it through atom to atom contact. In method B, it also produces a more intense image, not because it is touching, but because it is closer to the linen, and some kind of inverse distance/intensity relationship is operating, but which cannot be Newton’s inverse square law (see a comment I made here yesterday re collimated radiation in response to anoxie as I recall) What’s more, both mechanisms produce an image without directionality (i.e. No differences in apparent “illumination” on opposite sides of a face, which is another contributor to the unusual quality of the Shroud image, but that’s by the way. But while the extremities like the nose will imprint with roughly the same intensity by both mechanisms, the same is not true for the sides of the nose. In Method A, they do not imprint well, because there is little pressure of contact due to oblique angle of presentation. In Method B the intensity will be almost as good as the tip of the nose, assuming collimated rays are travelling to meet the linen along the perpendicular meeting the linen at right angles, but slightly less. So which mechanism will give the best ‘scalability’? I would guess Method B, being a function simply of distance, whereas Method A is far more complex, given image intensity responds to small and subtle changes in facial contours. If we judge the quality of a Shroud image purely in terms of scalability – as I believe you did recently – of smooth gradations in 3 D ness – then Method B will seem to be indicated. But suppose “subjective 3 D ness” is a better criterion. Then that would indicate that the radiation model was not operating, that the imprinting method depended on contact, So we have to find software image analysis programs that can discriminate between Method A and Method B imprinting – by looking at the way they respond to distance gradients AND contour angles starting with the same template. (It may need to be hollow with slits and illuminated from inside to model Method B collimation). The nose – tip and sides – would seem a promising place to starting looking for clues to imprinting mechanism. And here I must stop while I think about it some more, and await your reaction to my initial ramblings..","date":"2013-11-04","mins":"6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/should-we-be-reassessing-the-vp-8-results-continues-previous-post/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Should we be reassessing the VP-8 results (Continues Previous Post)"},{"id":"comment-49986","author":"colin_berry","post":"Colinsberry : Yes, that image of the black lady shows graphically what a mess that 3 D enhancement can make of a black and white photograph when all it can read is tonal contrast, enhancing regions that reflected most light over those that did not.

The sinews do not look like a necklace on your photograph. They look like sinews – prominent as they tend to be is some people, but still sinews (OK, prominent, but then so are the collar bones). The reason they are grotesque in Image J is because they look as if they have become detached from the body – so one’s first thought is not that they are sinews, but some kind of necklace or even collar. I’ve no doubt one would also recoil if more could be seen of what Image J has done to the collar bones, that now look like some kind of pelmet. But it’s the principle that matters. Regardless what one thinks of the “quality” (?) of the Shroud image versus modern photographs in Image J, everyone is surely agreed that the first lacks directionality, the second usually DOES have directionality, and that makes for a big vulnerability in modern photographs – namely that Image J will target those parts of the image with most reflected light and produce results that are or can be either outlandish, or heavily asymmetrical, due to lateral lighting, or both. That cannot happen with the Durante 2002 or other “as is” Shroud images, so while one may still find fault with this or that detail, it won’t be on account of directionality which is not there. What’s more, when we put our Durante image into Image J, the first thing we do (well, me at any rate) is perform a tone inversion so what the software is doing is applying 3 D enhancement to what was at the lighter, more subtle end of the grayscale – helping to achieve a soft focus result that is superior (sorry, superior) to what one can hope to achieve with a normal photograph. The end result does not necessarily match the starting subject (see the banner on my blog) but then who can say that the Shroud image is an exact match of the original subject anyway? STURP was too quick (keen?) to dismiss a medieval provenance, and image formation mechanisms based on contact, thermochemistry etc. For most of the team, including Rogers, Adler, Jackson and others, there is clear resort to the Biblical narrative as a presupposition, as distinct from proposition to be tesetd (thus starch impurity coatings/putrefaction amines, thus bilirubin and blood clot exudates.

I hadn’t realized until recently that the collimated radiation proposed cannot obey Newton’s inverse square law, given the absence of beam divergence to produce progressively small illumination per unit area of screen at different distances. Back came the answer that a different principle was operating to create a different kind of beam weakening effect for generating cloth body distance information. Apparently there’s a mysterious radio opaque substance in the air (let’s call it Factor X) that attenuates the beam. But is has since occurred to me that this ingenious mechanism, aka cop out, while imaginative, the stuff of Nobel prizes if confirmed, would sadly be self destroying. You see, if the radiant energy of the beam is to be progressively trapped en route from subject to linen (and needs to be for successful 3 D imaging) then the energy has to be converted to another form – it cannot just disappear. That almost certainly means thermal energy, presumably infrared, but that would energize the air molecules to give them extra kinetic energy (increased temperature) which would in turn cause the air to expand, thereby diluting and/or removing Factor X that is needed for beam attenuation. As I say, a self destructive mechanism, like choosing a bad place to sit on a tree branch that one is attacking with a chain saw. RIP Factor X?

In fact, this old hypothesis is very easy to rule out definitively as the body image formation mechanism with some basic experiments and a microscope.” Nothing can be ruled out if you experiment with a totally inappropriate template, lacking bas relief character, consisting merely of two stepped planes, and even then, going into, not out of the metal. That final sentence has to be one of the most arrogant I have ever encountered in a supposedly scientific paper. Preceding sentence “All these differences are related to the fundamental properties of color distribution resulting from the scorching of any linen fabric, i.e. The fact that a scorch is a contact only mechanism associated with the very low heat conductivity of linen and the spatial geometry of the fabric. This is inevitable.” Who said anything about the scorch being “contact only”? What gives TH that idea? There are three methods of heat transfer – conduction, convection and radiation. My main reason for doing my kind of experiment was to create a negative image, superficial, lacking angled directionality, having encoded 3 D etc etc. All those have been achieved at least in principle (quantification still required) and I can be fairly confident now that radiation models are simply wrong and (in all probability I suspect) agenda driven. At no stage have I ever said my experiments rely purely for their action on conduction, and have in fact written at length on the fact that some convection will always accompany conduction. In other words, as soon as presses hot solid against fabric, hot enough, that is, to cause instant pyrolysis of carbohydrates, one is producing superheated steam and air and other gases that can have knock on effects that affect fabric at points that are not in immediate contact, e.g. Into the interstices of the weave, (Yes, tenting effects are problematical, and there is still work to be done, but the Shroud literature is similarly unclear on the question of cloth body distances too, e.g. With reference to claims that radiation does not work at cloth body distances greater than 5cm. Why 5cm? What’s so special about that distance? Since when have radiation effects had sudden cut offs?) With his stepped template and his description of scorching as purely a contact process TH has resorted to what I believe are called “straw man”arguments in an attempt to knock down my ideas.But since he couldn’t even be bothered to acknowledge either my existence or make reference to any of my numerous experiments, then I don’t need to feel personally offended.

What you say seems to me hypothetically feasible. But… hypotheses are not evidences. Some additional historical involvements should be studied. For instance: you can obtain an image very similar to the Shroud by using opaque glasses… but it is uncertain that these big glasses could be made in the Middle Ages. My one concern is the proposition that the Shroud image has properties that defy science. What are these properties that defy science? I would really like to know. You mention superficiality above. What is so unusual about a superficial image? Has anyone measured the minimum thickness of a scorch, for example, required for it to be visible at different distances (but recalling that one has to stand well back from the Shroud, 2 or more metres it is said, to identify the very faint image as that of a man). What seems fairly certain, as Garlaschelli has pointed out, is that the image would have been more intense centuries ago than the one we see now, and possibly less superficial if the original had comprised an adherent layer of sensitizing solid like ochre pigment, one that has subsequently flaked off leaving just a faint etch on the fabric. The STURP team described the Shroud image a modification of the carbohydrates of starch by chemical dehydration, oxidation etc. Similar to that which results from contact with heat of acid. What is so unusual about that? Why the mystique? Again, to return to Garlaschelli, he suggested that the original Shroud was made by a combination of frottage (dabbing) and painting with dry or moist ochre, and that the latter if made by heating green vitriol (hydrated iron(II)sulphate) could well have been contaminated with sulphuric acid (the earliest preparations of sulphuric acid were made by destructive distillation of green vitriol, where the evolved fumes of SO2 and SO3 are trapped in a water bath. Sorry to land you with the chemistry, but the medievals too had no idea what they were doing in chemical terms. All they knew was that a certain green mineral that occurs in nature could give a high quality form of red ochre on heating, but they had no litmus paper with which to test each batch for acidic impurities that could be there on account of its method of production. Yes, the Shroud is a one off, which is what makes it so interesting, but that means one is NOT obliged to look for parallels as would be he case if viewing it primarily as a work of art, which I do not. I see it as a clever and original piece of visual graffiti, probably with a political message that would have been instantly understood by its first viewers – probably a highly select group. The added post weaving raised side seam on the reverse side (later hidden by the Holland cloth) was probably there from the start, either as a finger grip for manual display, or for slotting into a horizontal groove for more permanent display, perhaps as a scroll type set up that could be rolled to fold away. Yes. It’s all hypothesis. So is the claim that it is the burial shroud of Jesus Christ. It’s a question as to who has the better supporting evidence. I have the radiocarbon dating on my side, and I reject the dubious claim that the three labs were all working on a repair. If they don’t like that rejection, then they know what they have to do (in cooperation with the Shroud’s custodians).

The Templar in question was Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Order, burned at the stake in 1314, or maybe his lieutenant, Geoffroi de Charney (with an e in the surname), Preceptor of Normandy who was burned, or rather slow roasted alongside de Molay, and said to be uncle of the better known Geoffroi de Charny, Lord of Lirey, first known owner of the Shroud. It was nephew (?) de Charny (no e) who commissioned the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge for the 1355 display (or maybe his wife/widow, Jeanne de Vergy). Nope. I never imagined for a moment that the roasted or semi roasted Tempalrs were used directly to produce a scorch imprint on linen. They were probably reduced to ashes, ase some contemporary accounts would lead us to believe. No, what I suggested was that his presumed nephew sought a means of commemorating his uncle, and commissioned someone to make a bronze statue or bas relief of Geoffroi de Charney .that was then heated up to make a scorch imprint, the latter serving as a visual metaphor for the manner in which he went to meet his Maker. That theory was based on some peculiar details on the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge, notably the presence of what looks like a coiled rope or chain around the waist which has no obvious role in crucifixion but features in lithographs etc of burnings at the stake, de Molay’s included. To cut a long story short, I dropped the (disastrously named) “hot Templar” theory on becoming acquainted with the Mark 2 version of the Lirey Badge, or rather the Machy mould for one, with its inset image of the Veil of Veronica. I’ll spare you and other the details of why that led to dropping the ‘hot Templar’ hypothesis, and my switching instead to the notion that the TS was designed from the word go to be a whole body version of a Veronica like imprint in sweat and blood, but whole body, not just face, and post , as distinct from pre mortem. The suggestion that something other than flour might have served as the imprinting medium was simply to cover myself, there being an abundance of different cereal and other solid powdered foodstuffs that have both reducing sugars and proteins, ones that can be relied upon to give yellow or brown melanoidins (Maillard reaction products). My money’s on wheaten white flour. Incidentally, I’ve found that a pinch of sodium bicarbonate to the flour, or use of alkali limewater to wet the linen, greatly speeds up the browning of flour imprints in the oven, making it almost certain that one is looking at Maillard products (alkali being known to facilitate their formation)..","date":"2016-08-04","mins":"8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/08/04/shroud-question-1-from-david-goulet-its-to-do-with-the-testability-or-otherwise-of-that-seemingly-shunned-14th-century-flour-imprinting-model-mine/","cat":"new_theory","title":"Shroud Question 1 from David Goulet: it’s to do with the testability of my 14th century flour-imprinting model."},{"id":"comment-155891","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks David O.

Can Dr. Sciencebod produce evidence of this.” Well, I don’t blame you for trying to pin me down on the detail, given I have come to your site wearing my science hat (I’m ‘newsjunkie’ btw on current affairs sites). At the risk of seeming evasive, I have to say that the interest in the Shroud for me is not just to do with the verifiable science (of which there is little, given there has been only rare and sporadic access to the material) but also with the manner in which the science, such as it is, is interpreted – or as often as not misinterpreted in the media. So like everyone else, I peruse various sites that I come across, usually through googling, and hoover up the comments that seem to be the ones that are fixed in people’s minds, and which are rarely if ever challenged, even if this is “internet received wisdom!” so to speak and a far cry from standard textbook science. So in reply to your question, i won’t even attempt to track down authoritatative sources, even assuming they exist – or that I would be personally capable of hudging their credibility. I will simply quote some words that are certainly close to the ones I expressed re the assumptions made in setting up a computer to detect the alleged “encoded 3 D information”. Example: “3 D INFORMATION. The image on the Shroud varies inversely with the cloth to body distance. This means that the darker the image the closer this part of the body was to the Shroud and the lighter the image the further away these parts of the body were from the Shroud when the image processing occurred. This means that every pixel in the gray scale of the Shroud image carries a cloth to body distance relationship. This particular quality was used to create the Holograms of the Shroud image.” http://shroud3d.com/home page/introduction image qualities of the shroud of turin So what do you make of that, Dan and others? I know what I make of it, but then maybe I’m a cynic (and have already given too much away). Yes, I know that the writer is ostensibly referring to the supposed formation of the original image, as distinct from the 20th century relief mapping – but I say “ostensibly”. Is there not a conflation of the two, such that it’s virtually impossible to distinguish Shroud and processed image, or between established fact, and prior assumption?

The too good to be true scourge marks are a case in point. Allow me to explain. Having decided at the outset that the body image was to be restricted to skin and hair (sweat laden hair supposedly behaving essentially like sweat coated skin) a decision had to be made re wounds. Do open wounds sweat? No, they leak blood, but don’t sweat. So there are no wounds visible anywhere on the body image (don’t let anyone tell you otherwise). Committee resolution: wound sites have to be identified entirely by blood That’s no problem as regards nail wounds, lance wound, crown of thorns wounds etc where a copious blood flow can be imagined and then suitably executed. It’s those scourge wounds that are the problem, How much blood do you apply to each tiny scourge wound site? Add too much and it’s then no longer clear that it’s a scourge wound. So what we have are all those production line dumbbell shaped blood imprints looking for all the world as if they had been applied by an ink jet printer – precisely metered amounts just enough to show the shape of the business end of a Roman flagrum and no more. But that’s not how real wounds behave. Some scourge wounds would bleed more than others. Committee resolution: don’t be too perfectionist. The average pilgrim isn’t. It’s first impressions that count. As I say, the TS image has (metaphorical) human fingerprints all over it – from clever, meticulous, self disciplined fingers to be sure, working to a rigid protocol, but human ones all the same.

I was wondering when you would be along to fire your customary broadside. You raise a number of points, too many to address in a single comment. Let’s just take the first, re the Veronica not being a sweat imprint but a miraculous image. First, I think you are putting the cart before the horse. Let’s start with the horse, first, and see what wiki has to say, not because it’s always the ultimate source of wisdom, but because it’s most people’s first port of call, so is unlikely to say anything that has hugely offended common sense (which is the crucial issue here in my view – common sense, not specialist historical or theological knowledge). I’ve bolded up the words that in my view make it reasonable to assume that the Veronica image WAS seen as, first and foremost, a sweat imprint IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. To deny that, or dismiss it as irrelevant, seems unhelpful to say the least. The Veil of Veronica, or Sudarium (Latin for sweat cloth), often called simply “The Veronica” and known in Italian as the Volto Santo or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved crucifix Volto Santo of Lucca) is a Catholic relic of a piece of cloth, which, according to legend, bears the likeness of the face of Jesus not made by human hand (i.e. An Acheiropoieton). Various existing images have been claimed to be the “original” relic, or early copies of it, but the evidently legendary nature of the story means that there are many fewer people, even among traditional Catholics, who treat claims of actual authenticity very seriously compared to the comparable relic of the Turin Shroud. The final form of the Western legend recounts that Saint Veronica from Jerusalem encountered Jesus along the Via Dolorosa on the way to Calvary. When she paused to wipe the blood and sweat (Latin sudor) off his face with her veil, his image was imprinted on the cloth. The event is commemorated by the Sixth Station of the Stations of the Cross. According to some versions, Veronica later traveled to Rome to present the cloth to the Roman Emperor Tiberius and the veil possesses miraculous properties, being able to quench thirst, cure blindness, and sometimes even raise the dead. As I say, a sweat imprint in the first instance. That does not prevent it being somehow miraculously upgraded to a spectacular portrait if one is minded to do so. I’m sure generations of artists were only to happy to assist that upgrading, given that sweat imprints per se offer limited opportunities to show of their artistic skills. But let’s not overlook one thing – there is no biblical basis for the Veronica anecdote, and thus no compelling reason for the man or woman on the Clapham omnibus to believe that any relic described as the Veil of Veronica had any miraculous origins. It’s just a legend. 14th century entrepreneurs may simply have seized upon that legend as a pretext for fabricating a burial shroud with a FAINT NEGATIVE IMAGE of a recently deceased man that would be immediately perceived as some kind of imprint, one that would be assumed to be made by sweat, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, as per the then celebrated Veil of Veronica. But making that connection, i.e. Imprint > Veronica > sweat needed some extra help, which will lead on (tomorrow) to my second response to your comment, namely the appearance of that Christ like face above the word SUAIRE on the Machy mould. We can discuss tomorrow whether the eyes are open or closed, and much else besides, though I somehow suspect this discussion is going to lead nowhere, it being down to individual interpretation. Those who see the TS as the genuine burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth are making an interpretation, and must not be surprised at the existence of counter interpretations, especially those like mine that have a strong (though not exclusive) scientific basis and are based on a now lengthy period of intensive study and research. It will take more than statements of others’ opinion or interpretation to shift me from mine, unless they come up with new authoritative information or data, which you, TH, if you will forgive my saying, have so far failed in your comment thus far to deliver..","date":"2014-11-18","mins":"6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-171996","author":"colin_berry","post":"PS Here’s an article featuring the Veronica that appeared in the popular press just over 3 years ago. Http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article 2022329/Priceless Veil Veronica painting shows true face Christ recovered woman burgles mobile home tries sell church.html The only reason for mentioning it now is that it attempts to make clear the relationship between an initial “imprint” and later more attractive versions, stating that the initial imprint was “copied” by artists, thus preserving for posterity the “likeness” of Jesus. Based on that I think it’s a mistake to place too much emphasis or credence on the narrative that would have us believe that the imprinting aspect is an irrelevance, that there was some kind of instant or even slow motion one miracle that of itself generated a high quality image without artists needing to become involved. Once the latter happens, and paint starts flowing freely, things tend to spin rapidly out of control, the end results of which are currently plain for all to see. I refer to Charles Freeman’s claim that the TS initially showed a “Crown of Thorns” that one can see in later painted copies, and that ipso facto there must have been a crown of thorns on the original TS that has since (selectively!) faded from view. What seems more likely, indeed certain, is that there was a Veronica like process, where an initial image that was at best a mere imprint gradually acquired further embellishment with each new generation of artists, so that blood on forehead or in hair from presumed thorns and their wounds, the latter not imaged, was considered insufficient, making unreasonable demands on the average pilgrim’s interpretive skills. Thus it was argued it was perfectly legitimate to insert the ‘missing’ crown of thorns as a visual aid. In time the distinctions between fact and fancy became progressively blurred. (Turning that on its head, one feels that Charles as a historian really had no business in back projecting from later copies of the TS to the original in the way that he did, knowing as he should the nature of artistic licence, especially as regards devotional art).","date":"2014-11-19","mins":"2:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-172020","author":"colin_berry","post":"“There is no evidence that the TS forger wanted to compete with the Veronica Veil. ” Oh but there is TH.

However there were a handful of departures from the “imprint only” script, no doubt carefully mulled over, made in the interests of artistic impression (like that gap between the frontal and dorsal head images, when there should have been continuity given the straight line skull circumference distance of separation shown). Plan A, with unbroken image continuity across double fused heads would have been a real turn off. Plan B? Separate the heads too much as if there had been a generous surplus of linen? Nope. It then ceases to look like a practical, economical snugly fitting burial ‘bag’. So settle instead for the SSI Working Party’s compromise Plan C (no one will notice, except maybe a 21st century NZ engineer in the distant future who measures the separation of heads and declares that something’s not right as regards the failure of the top of head to leave an image)..","date":"2014-11-19","mins":"5:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"id":"comment-172158","author":"colin_berry","post":"Yup, it was a certain friendly neighbourhood blogger, not a million miles away, more like 12,000 I guess, who was first to point out your error in mistaking a water stain for the head, daveb. ; ) Let’s not lose sight of the central point, which is this: even in authenticity models, where there is recourse made to what some of us regard as supernaturalism (miraculously collimated radiation, wavelength unspecified, which is able to imprint images onto linen across air gaps) the inconsistencies become painfully apparent, like the ‘top of head’ problem. One then sees folk on this site go into what I call INNIT mode (INNIT = It’s Not Inconceivable That…) and then the qualifying assumptions begin to flow freely. It’s the need for those qualifying assumptions that is scarcely constrained by the existence of Occam’s razor, occasionally needing something more akin to a chain saw massacre. You yourself acknowledge solutions offered to resolve the ‘top of head’ problem, one of which may or may not require certain Jewish folk to revise their knowledge of 1st century burial practice (the “jaw strap”). Incidentally, I was taught that Occam’s Razor is “entities should not be multiplied needlessly”. The more commonly quoted one on internet sites, i.e. “the simplest model is likely to be the correct one” probably came later, and is often misapplied in the scientific context where testing of hypotheses is concerned, models being for using, not believing, and can thus be shamelessly refined or qualified. In my model, the ‘top of head’ model is explained quite simply. The artisans didn’t like the look of fused heads, so inserted a damp cloth or similar to prevent imaging at that point. Look, no need to make assumptions about ancient burial practices, and one can make a prediction: if there’s one concession made to practical or artistic considerations, then there are likely to be others too (“no top of head, no open wounds either, just blood, but let’s image the soles of those feet since legs without feet will look odd etc.etc”).

If using heat from a template, then it’s important to get a minimalist scorch that does not go through to the reverse side, or which produces too obvious “burn” marks on the top surface – just faint yellow or tan coloration. There must not be excessive lateral distortion from the wraparound effect, though a little can be tolerated. The difficult bits out of plane with the long axis (notably feet) must be imaged but not excessively so. The neck/chin area is tricky – very tricky. That prominent transverse baked in crease may be there for a purpose, perhaps to distract from a unnatural look that comes from imprinting a 2 D image from abrupt changes in relief on a 3 D template or to suggest kinking of the linen as the reason for anomalies. The intensity of the frontal and dorsal images must be very nearly the same. There must be a severe cut off at both sides of the face, since it’s been decided (committee resolution) that “sides” don’t image. By the same token the top of the head won’t leave an image, being a kind of “side” so the gap between the frontal and dorsal head must be just right for credibility, given it’s a single immobile body that is being imaged in a “thought experiment”. The eyes are critical. There has to be just the right amount of image intensity to suggest weakly imaged closed eyes (weak because of difficulty of imprinting from recessed features set back in a cavity). Too much image intensity might suggest the eyes were open. That would really spoil your day.

So my revised thinking re the TS image arguably ticks a few more boxes (notably as regards image strippability as demonstrated by Rogers with his Mylar adhesive tape, maybe fuzziness too, and also allows for blood before image). But I don’t imagine for one moment that it ticks all the numerous boxes. What the model does do is to find a role for a mechanism that can be seen as a half and half mix of the purely thermal vs purely chemical, i.e. A thermochemical provenance. One has to have the right chemicals present (of foreign origin in this sadly anti authenticity model – namely exogenous ingredients for a Maillard reaction) and that essential supply of Arrhenius activation energy that Rogers tried to downplay, namely elevated temperature, way, way above that which could be achieved by a cadaver resting on a slab in a 1st century rock tomb.

If X looks tricky, then move to Y, if Y lloks tricky, move to Z. Corgiat’s pyrography involved drawing a negative image – perhaps its weakest aspect, but at least it did show some encoded 3 D characteristics, which are not that difficult to embed – all that’s needed is a gradation of image density rather like contour lines on a map. Even the 1532 burn marks on the Shroud respond to 3 D imaging – not surprising when you think about density gradients in charring. Oh, and let’s not forget that the challenge is not merely to reproduce putative medieval technology, but all the ageing changes and assorted insults from hot pokers (allegedly) fires, water, mending etc etc. I’m pretty certain that the Shroud image is some kind of pressure imprint, dare one call it a barograph. It’s knowing how the imprint was captured and memorised is the next question. I stioll believe it was a scorch. The head may have been a metal bas relief, as suggested earlier, but I’m coming round to the idea that it was fired or even unfired ceramic – simply clay that was allowed to set, and then heated to make the ‘barothermograph’ aka scorch, which fits with a lot of the crucial characteristic of the Shroud image.

That is due to microbial action – the bacteria have enzymes that hydolyse peptide linkages in proteins and then go on to decarboxylate the amino acid monomers to free amines (ammonia, putrescine, cadaverine etc). It’s a bit more problematical deciding how free amines can form simply by adding a weak alkali (limewater) to flour in the 14th century as distinct from 1st century model, but my nose says they do. As I say, it’s somewhat of a long shot to implicate a free amine in my flour/hot iron model, based purely on that fishy smell one gets on mixing flour and alkali. I might try testing flour that has been pretreated with lime, even heated (since heated flour works as well as cold flour).

The Shroud, which has been specially brought from Chambéry, with great ceremony, by Duke Philibert of Savoy and Duchess Marguerite, is exposed on an altar in one of the great halls of the Duke’s palace. Savoy courtier Antoine de Lalaing records of the events of that day: “The day of the great and holy Friday, the Passion was preached in Monsignor’s chapel by his confessor, the duke and duchess attending. Then they went with great devotion to the market halls of the town, where a great number of people heard the Passion preached by a Cordeilier. After that three bishops showed to the public the Holy Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and after the service it was shown in Monsignor’s chapel.” Lalaing adds that the Shroud’s authenticity has been confirmed by its having been tried by fire, boiled in oil, laundered many times ‘but it was not possible to efface or remove the imprint and image.’ Note the date, a mere 150 years or so after the first appearance of the linen “imprint and image” in western Europe (Lirey, approx 1357). Would it really have been subjected to those treatments, real or apocryphal, if there had been the slightest suspicion that it was “just a painting”?

It’s from the generally pro authenticity Thomas, but there you go… You can’t have everything… Thomas commented on Thank You, Everyone. In response to Charles Freeman: I agree with Hugh. The Quem Queritis ceremony early on Christmas morning required a burial cloth to be held up to show Christ had risen. Some were known to have been painted though we don’t know exactly how. In a large church and in the dim early light the priority must have been impact and […] Charles I have to say you have a quite nice theory but I am afraid to say it falls down on many counts, in my opinion. So where do I start? ‘The Quem Queritis ceremony…required a burial cloth to be held up to show Christ had risen’ Problems: – the Shroud image is not one of a glorified risen Christ – people such as yourself argue that the silence of history in describing an imaged shroud is a problem for the authenticist’s case. But then you argue for an imaged (front and back for good measure) shroud to be held up in a ceremony as opposed to say a non imaged but bloodied shroud. I think this is logically inconsistent. Why show an imaged burial shroud ‘to show Christ had risen’ if there was no tradition of a full body imaged shroud? – the Shroud itself is of such length as to be quite a nuisance to ‘hold up’ – why ‘manufacture’ a front and back image? A frontal image would have been enough and a lot easier to manage. Your theory suggests a purely ceremonial origin for the shroud but the ultra realistic front and back image flies in the face of this. – the nude image goes against the art history grain….yes yes there were one or two rare exceptions but they were discrete images not things for widespread public display. And sorry I don’t buy your argument at all that there was originally a loin cloth on the image that wore off. – I just don’t buy your argument that the image is the product of a faded painted image. For many reasons. A painted shroud makes sense for an Quem Queritis object, a novel and as of yet inadequately explained image does not (when a painted image would be all that was required for an abstract and symbolic ceremonial use).","date":"2015-12-22","mins":"9:32 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2015/12/21/the-turin-shroud-as-decus-et-tutamen-an-ornament-and-a-protection/","cat":"contact_imprint","title":"The Turin Shroud as “Decus et Tutamen” – an Ornament and a Protection?"},{"id":"comment-208223","author":"colin_berry","post":"Comparing my email inbox with recent Comments suggests that a certain contributor is being pre moderated, possibly blocked.

It’s not as if there’s an imperative to do so, there being no biblical record of any image imprints on linen. But there is a practical rationale in the context of what was on display, whether one calls it a “liturgical illustration” or “ornament/protection” or – as an afterthought – a visual aid. A wooden statue will always look like wood, unless very expertly painted to look like real human flesh (which might be too much given the naked state of the subject and medieval sensibilities). If it looks like wood, then there’s no point in carefully applying blood in all the right locations, in an attempt to show it’s not just any naked male, but a particular one who had been scourged, crucified etc etc. That’s where the shroud comes in. One can paint one’s blood onto the basal body image – the latter modelled as ‘sweat’ – making the shroud as realistic looking as one wishes. Being a completely independent artefact from the wood means there isn’t then the same illusion destroying clash as would be the case if blood had been painted on wood. The apposition of 3 D statue with 2 D imprint in the same field of view makes for a visual feast, with main course (statue) and afters (image) albeit a somewhat stomach churning one for finer sensibilities.

He was describing his oven heating step as a means of accelerating an aged appearance, while overlooking that the elevated temperature was in fact a scorching step, provided the scorching was confined to the area of linen immediately under the solid ochre pigment or at any rate more advanced there than non ochre areas. In fact his (or rather Joe Nickell’s) acid impurity hunch fitted well with that localized effect. If the ochre had indeed been contaminated with dilute sulphuric acid due to method of manufacture (calcining of green vitriol, i.e. Ferrous sulphate heptahydrate, Fe SO4.7 H2 O) that became steadily more concentrated on heating and evaporation of water then etching/scorching might well have been confined to the parts that were immediately under the linen and not elsewhere.

Once it’s abstracted any free water, it then goes removing hydrogen and oxygen atoms from linen and other carbohydrates in a 2:1 ratio, i.e. The so called “elements of water” producing an appearance that at least initially looks for all intents and purposes like pyrolysis, i.e. Thermal discoloration.

One’s looking for a pre yellowed paper to bleach, or, alternatively, one’s looking for an initially white paper to become yellow. Before setting out, it’s as well to know that “light”, using the term in its broadest sense, can cause paper, linen and other lignin containing material to bleach OR yellow, and indeed the two processes can occur simultaneously! http://cool.conservation us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v01/bp01 11.html Why? Well, it’s complex, but arises because the chemistry of lignin yellowing is different from that of lignin bleaching, i.e. Not just a reversal. But here’s a clue: Yellowing of lignins is best achieved with sunlight containing wavelengths that are in the near uv, i.e. 360 390nm Bleaching of paper on the other hand is best done using daylight fluorescent lamps with ample wavelengths in the blue end of visible spectrum, i.e. 420 510nm. Why the difference? Uv light has energy sufficient to break chemical bonds that then initiates oxidation and yellowing reactions. Bleaching? Blue visible light, when absorbed by the yellowed lignin products, causes self sensitization with production of active singlet state oxygen, still molecular but a peculiar electronic configuration, different from ground state triplet oxygen. Singlet oxygen has a tendency to add across the conjugated double bond systems that are responsible for yellow colour causing bleaching. Don’t let anyone tell you that bleaching or yellowing of linen, paper etc is a simple predictable process, or that it would have been mastered by our medieval forbears. Yes, they left newly woven linen out in the fields, exposed to sun, in order to bleach until chlorine bleaches were discovered, but that’s about the extent of it. Primitive photo photography?

April 14, 1503 Good Friday: Exposition of the Shroud at Bourg en Bresse for Archduke Philip the Handsome, grand master of Flanders, on his return from a journey to Spain. The Shroud, which has been specially brought from Chambéry, with great ceremony, by Duke Philibert of Savoy and Duchess Marguerite, is exposed on an altar in one of the great halls of the Duke’s palace. Savoy courtier Antoine de Lalaing records of the events of that day: “The day of the great and holy Friday, the Passion was preached in Monsignor’s chapel by his confessor, the duke and duchess attending. Then they went with great devotion to the market halls of the town, where a great number of people heard the Passion preached by a Cordeilier. After that three bishops showed to the public the Holy Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and after the service it was shown in Monsignor’s chapel.” Lalaing adds that the Shroud’s authenticity has been confirmed by its having been tried by fire, boiled in oil, laundered many times ‘but it was not possible to efface or remove the imprint and image.’ I leave it to others to judge whether the TS body and/or blood image we see today could have survived that kind of treatment. What caught my eye on re reading it was the reference to the “imprint and image” (final 3 words). What was meant by “imprint”? Maybe the blood alone? If so, here’s a late 15th/early 16th century commentator, a well connected courtier no less, almost certainly well informed, who clearly didn’t see the blood (or “blood”) as simply daubed on vermilion or other artist’s pigment.

If the attached pigment were chemically to etch the linen (“acid impurities etc”) and s subsequently drop off with ageing, wear and tear etc, one still has the same tone reversed, i.e. Negative image. In short, it’s template to imprinted negative image in a single step, with the ‘negativity’ being conserved via chemical etching despite shedding of imprinting medium.

In fact,it was not until the Sunday Times ran a big feature on the Shroud back in the 70s (as I recall) that I had met the idea that wrists rather than palms would have had to be used for nails. The reasoning seemed sound at the time, but have others apart from me not found themselves questioning this new bit of scientific orthodoxy – one that makes the Shroud appear genuine but at the expense of the Bible? Sure, slender nails would not support a man’s weight if driven through the palms. But maybe they were thick spikes with a large area of metal in contact with flesh, with less pressure per unit area, less tendency for tearing. And am I not right in thinking that the feet were nailed to wedges, rather than the cross itself, which offer at least some support for body weight (if you recall your vectors in physics). Indeed, I seem to recall references to a particularly nasty detail of crucifixion – that it quite deliberately exposed the victim to slow suffocation through difficulty in inflating the lungs – forcing him to constantly “push and pull himself” upwards using nailed feet and hands respectively. (That was why the ordeal ended with breaking the legs – to prevent the pushing up that was preventing rapid suffocation and death, prolonging the ordeal).Trauma aside, “pushing up” would have been difficult, perhaps impossible,unless the feet had not been well supported and secured through provision of a wedge as well as nails. In other words, I think the palms may well have been the standard site for Roman crucifixion, and that while the wrist location on the Shroud is an interesting feature, it does not really have much to offer re the claim that it was Christ’s burial shroud. And I need hardly remind you or anyone else for that matter that the latter too differs markedly from the biblical account, which indicated a wind around cloth, with a separate cover for the face etc., that bodies were usually washed before burial etc that would remove blood, oily sweat etc etc. There is to my mind something terribly contrived about the Shroud of Turin – it is simply “too good to be true”, but that’s mere gut feeling I grant you.

While my knowledge on many of the issues is patchy, there is one apparent discrepancy that strikes the newbie quite quickly. On the one hand we read that the image is exceedingly superficial, scarcely penetrating into the fibres, yet above we read that if scorching were the mechanism then we would expect to see changes in the structure of the flax fibres. I do not see the latter as in any way self evident, far less obligatory, if one supposes that scorching affects the most superficial top surface only. Indeed, if a sketched image in charcoal or a similar black pigment were used to absorb radiant heat, as I have suggested, that might also tend to restrict scorching to a very small depth of penetration, such that fibrils look relatively intact immediately below the scorched layer… In other words, the carbon particles serve to protect deeper layers. There is also a recent paper on cellulose pyrolysis that starts by listing the initial depolymerisation products – levoglucosan, furfurals etc – and then makes the interesting observation that char is formed by re polymerisation of the decomposition products (rather than stripping out of volatiles, say, to leave a C skeleton). Http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp906702p Given that the monomers for the secondary polymerisation are small molecules and volatile, at elevated temperatures they will tend to diffuse rapidly from their sites of formation into the surrounding air.

The trouble is that it’s not art in the usual sense of the word. Any art would have been in the making of a template from which to produce a representation of a roasted Templar, and the artisan and his commissioner would have known that a scorch imprint (a light/dark reversed negative in modern terminology) did not have to be exact, which is why I consider that a bronze crucifix or similar might have been used. (It’s only through relatively modern photography, i.e. Secondo Pia’s 1898 light/dark reversed image that I suspect that a crucifix was used, knowing that a beard. Long hair etc were features shared by both Jesus and de Molay. The latter was much older of course, but many have remarked that the TS image is of a man much older than a 33 year old. Might a separate bas relief have been used as template for the face, as suggested by Luigi Garlaschelli? As for the Lirey badge, there seems to be absolutely no attempt to portray a Christ like figure. Itwas that which set me on the the route of thinking that the TS image was initially intended to represent someone other than Jesus, and if a scorch, to look around for anyone who was scorched in that era of French history. The de Charney/de Charny uncle/nephew relationship proposed by Noel Currer Briggs was all the encouragement I needed to make the Templar connection, but that clearly was not the whole story. There would have been attempts to disguise that later (thus fooling generations of scholars who have assumed that the present TS image was formed in a single step). I say it was formed in two steps an initial, rather unsubtle scorch, that was then doctored until it could be marketed as a sweat imprint – big brother to the Veil of Veronica. That’s why there’s that little inset face of Jesus on the Machy mould for Mk 2 Lirey badge, – to push a connection with the Veronica (thoughtfully labelled SUAIRE) which is not only “SHROUD” in French, but face cloth too, for the absorbing/imprinting of sweat, SUEUR in French, a word v.

Yet in the same breath he says the image is confined to the PCW of linen fibres, not affecting deeper layers. I’m sure i don’t need to remind him that the PCW has a rather different chemical composition from the core cellulose in the SCW, with a higher proportion of reactive hemicelluloses, and with relatively non crystalline cellulose (also more reactive). They allow the young cell wall to expand in its active growth phase, prior to acquiring the SCW.

A cotton sample similarly treated retained its colour and mechanical strength. The difference may be due to the presence in the central cores of linen fibres (secondary cell wall) of appreciable amounts of hemicelluloses that are more chemically reactive than cellulose and essentially absent from cotton. These results raise the possibility that the difference between the Turin Shroud’s coloured image v non image fibres are NOT confined to the highly superficial primary cell wall (estimated 200 600nm thickness) and may extend to the central core of the fibres too, resulting in loss of physical and chemical integrity, explaining perhaps the relative mechanical weakness of image fibres reported by STURP’s Raymond N.Rogers in his sticky tape sampling. If so, the process that gave rise to image imprinting on the TS may not have been as subtle as previously claimed, making it possible perhaps to model using technology that was available in the 14th century, corresponding to the radiocarbon dating.” http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/what happens if you spill battery acid.html Unfortunately I hit the Post button prematurely, so the posting’s URL (above) carries the provisional title, not the final one.

The next acid to be studied is nitric, HNO3. The more I read (history, primary and secondary cell wall structure and carbohydrate and protein composition) the more promising it looks. The working hypothesis is that the yellow TS image is formed by a xanthoproteic reaction between HNO3, nascent or preformed, and trace protein (defunct enzymes) in the primary flax cell wall. Quite a number of things can be accounted for – diimide bleaching (reduction of nitro to amine groups) and even the “apparent” blood first/image second ‘mantra’.

Are you not forgetting something? Image fibres are weaker than non image fibres. That was shown by the ease with which they could break off and stick to Rogers’ Mylar adhesive tape. It would take more than changes in the PCW – an ultra thin skin on a much thicker mainly SCW fibre – to render the entire fibre brittle and prone to fracture. (Let’s not forget that the Mylar initially stripped off entire fibres – not image “ghosts” – the latter not being seen/inferred until image fibres were subsequently pulled away from the tape). Try by all means to get the Vatican to consider your AFM scanning. But let’s dispense with the notion that the imaging process affected only the most superficial parts of the fibre.

There are significant amounts of hemicelluloses and pectins there too – the so called non cellulosic polysaccharides (NC Ps).Their physical and/or chemical disruption could compromise the strength and integrity of the entire fibre.

However, having spent 3 years in attempting to suss out the peculiar TS image, and been told by fellow scientists (well, some at any rate) that it has to be “supernatural” I can scarcely contain my growing conviction that a solution is finally within reach. A hint was provided in the previous comment or two. The question is: how to communicate the new idea? A fait accompli set out point by point? Sorry, not my style. I don’t do fait accompli Science works by hypothesis, experiment, interpretation, modification of hypothesis etc etc. There’s no room there for springing a fait accompli on folk. Better to build the story in easy instalments, ones that address the many disparate peculiarities of the TS image that have to be accounted for. (The new “hunch” could of course be wrong, and quickly demonstrated to be so, given it is capable of immediate testing by existing means were there free access to the Shroud. But there’s not, and indeed this blogger/retired biomedical scientist is not even able to wander into that Turin Cathedral simply to see the TS with his own eyes, so feels it’s not a huge and shameless imposition on folk, certainly on this ‘cutting edge’ site to say what’s in his mind, and to do so sooner rather than later. There are two ways I can lift the lid on the new thinking. One is to post on my own site, and (no disrespect to Dan) hope it gets reported here with no details neglected or glossed over – detail being crucial in scientific research. The alternative is to drip feed the new model here as a series of comments, as a continuation of this particular thread (why not, since Dan’s posting links to my site?) and not bother composing a posting to my own site until the feedback here has appeared. Might that not be a more internet friendly and democratic way of doing things, while admittedly a far cry from the traditional route via peer reviewed publication in journal articles (abstract only, cough up $$$ to get behind the paywall). What do folk think? Fait accompli on my site, or drip feed to this one? Title for the new idea? How about: “A novel N Ox/protein fumigation model for the Turin Shroud.” N Ox represents the binary mix of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) that react together with water and oxygen to form nitrous and nitric acids (HNO2 and HNO3 respectively), or alternatively are generated in a reverse reaction when preformed HNO3 from a reaction mixture in a distillation flask dissociates at high temperature. Nitric acid reacts quickly with proteins that contain aromatic side chains (tyrosine, tryptophan etc) to form yellow ‘xanthoproteic’ reaction products. Both light sepia TS non image background or darker, more intense TS image could be xanthoproteic reaction products formed by N Ox fumigation of intrinsic linen OR extrinsic non linen protein, or both. Several boxes can be ticked (e.g. Lack of image fluorescence, even the Shroud’s mysterious side strip).

Http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/modelling shroud of turin image with.html That was before I was imprinting off my own flesh and blood hand, and was imprinting off brass bas relief or 3 D templates as an alternative to hot scorching. The technique was very similar to the current one, i.e. To smear the metal template with vegetable oil, then dust with flour, then imprint onto linen (dry, not wet as currently) then oven bake. There were some very promising results ( bas relief templates) and some ghastly ones (3 D brass crucifix) and it was disconcerting to find that even the good images off the shallow relief horse brasses could be brushed off (in retrospect, a result of imprinting onto DRY linen). But there’s an important detail, namely that an image of sorts was obtained using “cornflour”, better described as corn starch, despite the latter having scarcely any protein, and thus unlikely to generate a Maillard browning reaction – though a simple caramelization reaction of sugars was possible to explain the final image. Caramelization of sugars does not need protein or other amine functional groups. It’s a sugar only reaction (maybe atmospheric oxygen too). Why mention it now? Maybe it’s premature to be talking about Maillard reactions. Maybe caramelization is a better description. Tomorrow I shall try imprinting off my hand using that low protein corn starch, not because it’s relevant to medieval France (it’s not, being a New World product), but to see whether the imprinting mechanism proposed with solid “flour” as dry powder and heat, albeit onto wet linen, can work with carbohydrates alone – indicative of caramelization – independent of proteins.if it’s caramelization alone, then the final attenuated image after washing may still be described fairly as a “scorch”, that much maligned description where sindonology is concerned.

According to Ray Rogers it is only the coloration of the outer wall of single cells. ANY photograph process would have required an emulsion of some kind which would be far thicker.” Who said anything about photography? A scorched on image, from something in intimate contact, is not photography, but more akin to “branding” (contact scorching). OK, so the scorch is confined to a single cell wall thickness, say 200nm. But our medieval ancestors were highly adept at applying that same thickness of material on the end of a brush to surfaces make them reflective and very attractive with it. I refer of course to illuminated manuscripts, gilding etc., using manually applied gold leaf, typical thickness 200nm – the same as a plant cell wall… Let’s not get hung up on 200nm. It’s just a number… The thickness of the natural oxide film on aluminium is just 10nm – but sufficient to totally alter its properties, making it seem like an unreactive metal.

The reason for my mentioning gold leaf, leaf please note – i.e. Gold hammered out – was to point out that whilst 200nm is extraordinary thin, it is a thickness that can still be handled, eg picking it up on the end of a brush, applying it to illuminate a manuscript etc. I have never suggested that the Shroud image was painted, being satisfied there is no compelling evidence for traces of pigments. What I find impossible to comprehend is the rejection of scorching on the most trifling of objections, chief among which, and apposite to this comment is the superficiality of the image, and its thickness being that approximating to single plant primary cell wall. If a 200nm thickness of gold, representing a few hundred gold atoms, is sufficient to make a surface reflective, why should anyone be surprised that a similar thickness of scorched carbohydrate is able to absorb a little of the blue component of white light, sufficient to give a faint yellow or brown coloration? There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the Shroud image IS a scorch, and elsewhere I have detailed how I think it was produced by thermal imprinting from a heated 3 D or semi 3 D object relying on heat conduction (not radiation) where cloth is forced to make contact under applied pressure into a sand bed with hot metal. Such a process is able to explain why scorching is so highly localised, and can also explain other features – the creasing of the cloth at the chin and top of the head, the “over long” neck, which is due to thermal printing off the underside of the chin as well as the neck, making the latter seem as much as 10 cm longer than was really the case. I believe John Jackson was 90% of the way to a correct answer when he did his experiments with a hot statue and showed that the scorch image had “encoded 3 D information”. I have merely added the sand bed to make the system more ‘technician friendly’ – ensuring rapid and fairly complete apposition of cloth to hot metal around all the important contours to get a detailed imprint. Thermal imprinting can even provide an answer to the “double image” problem recalling the fainter image on the opposite side of the linen but not the intermediate cellulose fibres, but I shall save that for another day, after posting it first to my own site.

The chief one is that PRESSURE is needed on that ‘branding iron’ or other 3 D object, if the latter is at a temperature well below red heat, say mid 200s Celsius to get a good sharp imprint. That’s because hot agitated metal atoms with their delocalised cloud of electrons really do have to make actual contact with the atoms within the surface of the cloth. No air gap is permissible, not even 10nm. One can see this by looking at a light scorch mark under a magnifying glass, or even with the naked eye – only the crowns are scorched, where one fibre loops over another (weft over warp or vice versa). I cannot stress too strongly that scorching by contact/conduction process is an EXCEEDINGLY localised process, and fully capable of affecting only tiny thicknesses of fibre at the surface, even as low as 200nm or less (but which is not really that “thick” at the atomic/molecular level). Surface chemistry often involves much thinner layers giving major changes in physical and chemical properties (see my earlier reference to the natural oxide film on aluminium). It is the sand bed in my refinement of the Jackson strategy that provides that essential physical, non chemical ingredient – MECHANICAL PRESSURE – and which will, I suspect, provide an aid to confirming, or at any rate supporting, the theory that the image was formed by contact/conduction. The 3 D encoding in this theory is due as much if not more to the distribution of differential pressure between cloth and template as it is to simple differences in physical relief. A flat surface within a hollow, e.g. An eyelid, would image poorly based on miraculous high energy radiation assuming the inverse square law still operated but images perfectly well if cloth is forced into an eye socket so as to make contact with an “eye lid” or representation thereof that is approximately square on to the cloth allowing compaction of cloth against metal allowing actual zero gap contact to take place.

I thought it had a more fundamental meaning in the context of the TS image, a reference to it’s ‘flatness’ for want of a better term – that being due to there being no indication of an angled light source. At first sight, any illumination from “light” would have to have been non oblique, i.e coming from directly behind the viewer. It’s that out of this world absence of ‘directionality’ to do with absence of external ‘ illumination that surely sets the TS image apart from standard paintings, even degraded ones, where the artist exploits the fixed oblique angle of incident light to create areas of shade and with it an illusion of real life form (I hesitate to say 3 D ness since that risks further ambiguity and confusion). Is it any wonder that some see the subject itself as the source of radiant energy, wavelength usually unspecified, albeit with handy orthogonal projection and ability to ‘scorch’ linen across air gaps, provided (a) they don’t exceed 3.7cm and (b) Occams’s razor is kept in its protective sheath. There are other ways, needless to say, of creating non directional images with negative properties. Imprinting off a template is one. The humble rubber stamp serves as an everyday example. Imagine the ink being replaced with real or simulated body sweat, followed by an ageing step, natural or accelerated, imprinting a negative (light/dark reversed) image albeit as a barely discernible yellowing of the linen. But once there, it does not flake off, being a chemical modification of the linen fibres per se. ‘Faded paint’ can be safely dismissed as a pigment of a historian’s imagination, unsullied by considerations of detailed science, STURP’s especially.

I suggest folk revisit that posting, the one that starts with “a reader writes” and a highly informed one too who relates being acquianted early on with Barrie, and then, in a long, long comment, goes on to refer to John Heller and his book, and the claims made for blood on the “Shroud”. That was my cue tp point out something that I suspect few folk are aware of, namely that neither Heller no Adler went to Turin to see the linen with their own eyes, relying entirely one assumes on the photographs and/ or sticky tape slides from Ray Rogers to draw those (in)famous conclusions about “blood that is too red”, speculation re “trauma bilirubin etc all since much proselytzed since by Barrie on his lecture circuits (“for him the real clincher, thanks to world famous “blood expert” Alan D.

That’s when things started to turn nasty, with Barrie putting in a rare appearance in which he tried to bracket me with Harry Gove for attempting to attack the credentials of STURP team members with a “personal attack” on John Heller. I replied to the effect that Heller’s failure to go and see the TS with his own eyes, despite having made the first approach to John Jackson, flagging up his interest, was a breach of PROFESSIONAL standards, illustrating my point with analogies from other professions.. Barrie Schworts then returned unrepentant to the thread, giving all kinds of reasons why Heller did not need to go to Turin, financial considerations etc etc, re iterating his claim that I was making a personal attack, despite my having gone to some trouble to distinguish between lapses of professionalism and lapses of character, and right at the end chose to throw in references to things in the past that have clearly bothered him for some time. Why did he not raise them earlier. Might it be because my criticism in the past has been levelled at highly technical details to do with the chemistry etc, and that he didn’t feel competent to get involved. He ended his comment with the most outrageous attack on my character, one of the worst I have encountered in an entire lifetime. And now we have Paolo de Lazzaro piling in for good measure, adding to the choreographed charge sheet. His assumption that he could not be dealing with a fellow Ph D is then made an opportunity for Dan Porter to put “Mr.Berry” into his title, the subsequent word play fooling some but not I (having seen Dan Porter’s style of mud sticks negative spin far too many times already through misuse of titles and ‘jokey’ graphics).

As for the photochemically hapless Paolo, I will deal with him in good time on my own site, as I have done many times before. He really needs to acquaint himself with the First Law of Photochemistry, and drop the idea that linen can be regarded as entirely carbohydrate. There’s not a single reference to non carbohydrate constituents that could act as chromophores, notably lignin in that cited paper of his (but al least it’s free, which is just as well, since I would never pay good money upfront to read anything that comes from his agenda driven laboratory). That’s despite the important paper by Day et al on flax bast fibre lignins with their unusual monomer composition and S1 location having been in the literature for some 10 years. At least Thibault Heimburger noticed, he flagging it up in late 2012 when Hugh Farey brilliantly first suggested lignin as the possible chromophore. Maybe members of the SSG need to talk to each other more, before launching into their misguided experiments, their coloured conclusions. I shall now return to my out of focus microscope.

However I am now sorely provoked. This is not the first time that Dr .Paolo Di Lazzaro has crashed in on this site and addressed me as though I were a rank amateur. For his information, he was just 12 when at age 26 I took up my first full scientific research post at the University of Pennsylvania (1972). What’s more, the project was pure photochemistry (phototherapy of neonatal jaundice) where one quickly learned the importance of identifying the precise chemical nature of the chromophore when investigating a light driven reaction, whether using visible light or uv, whether using a high intensity mercury lamp as I was, or an excimer laser. What astounds me is Paolo Di Lazzaro’s assumption that the chromophore in his linen has to be cellulose. I see from that 2012 paper of his that he now thinks the cellulose must have mysteriously acquired a priming double bond from somewhere to be able to absorb uv light efficiently and undergo photochemical reaction. Well, that’s progress of sorts I guess. But why the fixation with cellulose? Why has he not considered the non carbohydrates, especially those like lignin and phenolics with C=C double bonds in profusion, albeit as delocalised aromatic ring systems? Maybe if he’d chosen a hypothesis that was scientific, i.e. Testable, one that was able to generate predictions, he’d have got round to doing simple checks on his preconceptions, like testing cotton as well as linen, cotton being closer to pure cellulose. I’ve actually done that experiment using my model system. I predicted that while I might get a coloration it would look different under the microscope. That hypothesis has been confirmed: linen gives the typical ‘half tone’ effect with a mixture of coloured and uncoloured fibres that I’m inclined to ascribe provisionally to internal S1 lignin. Cotton does NOT, there being a general slur of colour with no obvious fibres that are more coloured than others. You read it here first.

One can’t tell very much from looking at the intact fabric, since the coloured fibres that comprise the image are all bunched up together, making it impossible to decide where colour starts on a particular fibre and where it ends. I tried the Rogers’ technique of pressing sticky tape down on the fabric, then pulling off again. But the yield of fibres was very small, and there were surprisingly few coloured ones. Here’s the answer. Get some fine grade abrasive paper (“sandpaper” in common parlance) and draw it once or at most twice across the fabric. Go with the direction of the threads – weft or weave. Don’t go diagonally. Note the instant accumulation of detached fibres on the paper. Then harvest them with sticky tape. They come away cleanly, indeed quantitatively – and the tape surprisingly does not “stick” to the abrasive paper. Lay the tape sticky side down on a glass slide and examine at leisure. One will find a sizeable number of coloured fibres that demonstrate the two unusual properties of Shroud fibres: the half tone effect (where image fibres all have approx the same degree of coloration) and abrupt discontinuities of colour on particular fibres, i.e sudden change from yellow to colorless. One can also look at the fabric that has been abraded. Here and there one will see tufts of threads that have been sheared, and be able to see the stumps of coloured fibres. The model not only reproduces the look of Shroud fibres in the two respects flagged up, but provides an explanation too (something sindonology appears not to have done). It’s due to the colour entering the fibre in the form of oily coloured LIQUID that seeps into the fibres when the flour imprint with its attached oil ‘micro fries’ at the oven heating stage. The colour stays on or within the fibres at the final vigorous washing with soap and water to dispose of the encrusted surface material, leaving just the final resilient ‘ghost’ image..","date":"2016-09-10","mins":"11:07 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/08/16/might-invisible-ink-technology-mere-childs-play-have-been-superbly-fine-tuned-to-achieve-whole-body-imaging/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Might invisible ink technology (mere child’s play) have been superbly fine-tuned to achieve whole body imaging?"},{"id":"comment-7803","author":"colin_berry","post":"Hello Nigel Intriguing comment, though maybe not quite so intriguing as YOU KNOW WHAT. To any of those semi paranoid detractors who consider opposition to Shroud authenticity to be a carefully orchestrated campaign, I say NO, Nigel is not a plant, and NO, this blogger does not do planted comments. In fact, I’ve been in contact with a journalist recently about the possibility of some publicity re this blogger’s take on the TS (he’d contacted me previously re a totally different topic on my sciencebuzz site). The gist of his argument was that it was premature to place the flour imprinting hypothesis on a pedestal. Ie into the protected public domain, unless or until it had been tested on a real life size human being. Fair point, albeit one I’ve addressed before on this site. Yes, it would be nice (?) to go in there and blast the pro authenticity view to smithereens with one graphic that EXACTLY matched the Turin Shroud body image (blood stains to come later). Sorry, but is that not expecting too much, given we have no info whatsoever on what technology was employed (or might have been employed) in the mid 14th century? Let’s stick to the science, shall we, and leave the details of the whole body imaging technology to another day? Science is generally content to MODEL – not provide exact replicas of historical artefacts manufactured centuries ago. Science does ideas, not forgery. Suppose a visitor from Mars were to visit Planet Earth and spot a famous painting. “How on Earth did your folk manage to achieve that? ” they might ask? Given the answer that it was all done with Earth’s ground down minerals, dispersed in oil as “paint”; would one be expected to reproduce Leonardo’s “Mona Lisa”, exact in every tiny detail, in order to prove one’s point? No, of course not. Let’s try, shall we, to separate the scientific from the aesthetic and artistic? Yes, I know I’m talking to myself here. Sindonology is not interested in anything I have to say here, and we all know why. Might the MSM finally provide this suppressed , dare one say stifled voice of SCIENCE (the genuine variety, that is, not pseudo science) with an entry, a platform, into the BIG WIDE WORLD?

Yes, I believe that ‘micro frying” is the key to understanding the subtle characteristics of the Shroud image. How? Why? First, it’s necessary to flag up the existence of two variants of the flour imprinting technology. The first, the simpler of the two, is oil free. One simply sprinkles flour from an overhead sieve onto a recumbent subject until it forms a thick layer, then drapes with wet linen, then presses to mould the linen to the most superficial topology. That’s what I believe was used for what I call the Mark 1 shroud, the one depicted on the Lirey badge.There is nothing subtle about the Mark 1 image, as indicated earlier, though spectacular seems a fair description when one looks at the effect of adding water to the image post removal from the oven – it plumps up like a bas relief, giving a new insight to the Lirey badge! The second variant was deployed for a postulated Mark 2 Shroud, the one that has survived to this day using subtly different technology. The skin was coated first with vegetable oil, then flour sprinkled from above, and the EXCESS FLOUR SHAKEN OFF leaving just a light dusting of flour on its oil base. Imprinting was then as before, but the final image, after removal from the oven, was vigorously washed with soap and water, so as to detach all encrusted material, leaving just the ‘iconic’ ghost image. Where does micro frying enter the picture? Each flour particle that attaches to the wet linen in the Mk2 model takes with it a little oil from the skin. In the oven that oil heats up and fries its associated flour particle to a rich golden brown colour. Most of that colour remains in the flour, but a small proportion of the oil, loaded with coloured material, ‘sweats’ into the underlying fibres of the linen for a short distance, giving rise to those image ‘discontinuities’ and the so called ‘half tone’ effect, i.e, all or nothing coloration seen at the fibre level, i.e. The unusual microscopic properties that my model accounts for. It’s that sweated out liquid (and that only) one sees after vigorous washing. Thus the faint fuzzy character, so entirely different from the pre washed image. So Sam Pellicori and Joe Accetta were right in my estimation when they began to think about models that involved liquid penetration accounting for the image (e.g. Sweat, real or simulated, dyes, inks, etching acid contaminants etc etc). Sam’s early researches even deployed an oven heating step, as mentioned briefly in John Heller’s book, used to darken his lemon juice and other models for ‘sweat’. I now believe it was the substitution of a Mark 2 oil imprinted shroud for the Mark 1 water only model, with a change in the accompanying narrative (and striking of a new pilgrim’s badge, for which sadly we have only the incomplete Machy mould) that caused the local bishop to go ballistic! He considered he’d been conned, as indeed he had. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if for a while there were two shrouds in existence at Lirey. Mark 1 was displayed when the Bishop or one his chaplains looked in, obviously with no pretensions to being ‘authentic’. But as soon as the bigwigs were safely on their way back home, the Mark 2 version was brought out, ready for the next contingent of impressionable pilgrims… This site slipped overnight from Page 4 to Page 6 of Google listings. Why? Methinks there’s something rotten in the state of sindonology, the latter posturing as if an academic discipline. But academics discuss new findings relevant to their field, whether supportive of generally held preconceptions or not. They do not tempt to freeze out dissenting viewpoints and/or operate as a closed fraternity (“Shroud Science Group” etc). In passing, a full year has now passed since this researcher unveiled his flour imprinting model on the now lapsed shroudstory site, and if he’s not mistaken, the model (excluding Hugh Farey’s BSTS Newsletter) has never received so much as a single mention elsewhere by a ‘sindonologist’, including those who host internet sites that routinely challenge science to explain the shroud image – see earlier. Is it any wonder that my model is slipping off Google’s radar? If it weren’t for the occasional posting and comments on this site, my own included, it would probably be well nigh invisible on a Google search by now. Meanwhile, ‘popular’ MSM outlets like “History Today” provide a means for cynics like Charles Freeman to deliver their ‘post emptive’ strike (ignoring or haughtily dismissing all that has gone before). Such is the self sustaining nature of internet assisted click bait journalism that these self promoters, gratuitous offence intended, are able to sit at the top of Google rankings, misleading themselves and the rest of the world, in this instance with their cute ‘just a painting’ fantasy, all carefully packaged as if sound scholarship (which it most definitely ain’t)..","date":"2016-09-01","mins":"7:37 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/08/16/might-invisible-ink-technology-mere-childs-play-have-been-superbly-fine-tuned-to-achieve-whole-body-imaging/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Might invisible ink technology (mere child’s play) have been superbly fine-tuned to achieve whole body imaging?"},{"id":"comment-7707","author":"colin_berry","post":"Am still tweaking that ‘tagline’ that appears top right of the Home Page, next to the title (it being what Google sees and reports).

First the imprint’s particles were micro fried to a golden brown in a HOT OVEN. Soap and water then removed the surface encrustation, leaving, hey presto, that tenacious ‘enigmatic’ ghost image. See banner below.” Yes, it’s too long and detailed, but is the first, or maybe second step, in getting across the idea that the TS represents a staggeringly ingenious conjuring trick. The mere fact that it presents the first time viewer with a visual puzzle to solve (like why are there two figures, head to head?) is evidence in itself of an out of the ordinary design genius at work. What he was doing of course was to signal that the image was to be seen as an imprint, i.e. A contact imprint, between body – a certain body – and linen a certain length of linen, with further visual hints – bloodstains especially to consult scripture, notably the first THREE (not four) books of the New Testament, i.e the transport of a crucified body from cross to tomb. How strange that modern sindonological ‘scholarship’ should not only neglect the cues to contact imprinting, but attempt to dismiss imprinting by contact entirely. Well, not so odd perhaps when there are other agendas to pursue, inspired no doubt by the other parts of the NT focused on the final stages of interment and (especially) resurrection, post the arrival of a linen enshrouded body at the tomb, ready for removal of that TEMPORARY linen shroud, the latter NOT intended as final burial garment. The TS serves as a monument to how science, or rather so called science – can be selected and manipulated to serve an agenda.The term ‘pseudoscience’ fails to do justice to the systematic attempt to harness “science” for the purpose of mind control, not critically testing hypotheses but instead sugar coating them for the carefully targeted sweet tooth.

But one doesn’t have to imprint to get head hair, which is just as well, given I don’t believe the frontal hair was imaged via imprinting (only the prominent flesh over bone parts). The facial imprint was made first, and the hair added later by brushing on flour manually (dry painting!). The flour imprinting technology is VERY accommodating – given one can add and with care maybe even remove flour until one is happy with the look of the imprint before oven heating. In contrast, longish dorsal side head hair can be imprinted directly, having a hard base (skull) behind it. It could be tidied up manually, again by dry powder brushing. I doubt whether imprinted hair would look any different from imprinted skin, given the imprinting medium spreads pretty evenly over both surfaces, and is thus unable to capture the difference in texture. Wet imprinting, say with a flour slurry, might however capture texture (strands, curls etc). The lack of skin/hair texture differences on the TS might be seen as consistent with dry powder imprinting, but it’s not an area where I have hands on experience, having been more concerned with the challenge of frontal side imprinting, where head hair becomes something of a side issue (literally).

The commission is to produce a whole body representation of the crucified Jesus, as might be left in sweat and blood on J of A’s fine linen. Suppose you have done some preliminary experiments with white flour as your inspired and resourceful choice of imprinting medium, starting with the easy bits like hands, and then moving onto the tricky bit – the head, mainly on account of the nose, eye sockets etc etc. You look at your pilot imprint, and the first thing you notice is the lack of head hair in the frontal view (for reasons mentioned earlier). OK, one can get around that by brushing on white flour manually to the primary imprint to represent lank sweat soaked hair. It’s not the most natural looking hair in the world, but it’s supposed to be an post mortem imprint of a highly traumatized, recently deceased individual, a rare commodity in the world of art, probably with few capable or willing to pass judgement on realism or otherwise. But what about the beard and moustache, assuming that was regarded as obligatory in the mid 14th century, as no doubt was the case. There’s an immediate problem. The chin and upper lip imprint so well that the final image looks for all the world as if there’s already a beard and moustache (as I know, having previously shown that to happen when imprinting my own face). So why bother any further? OK, one could maybe brush on some additional flour in all the right places, but maybe that was tested and found wanting. Maybe too much flour gave rise to problems with the facial hair looking too prominent, or ‘not quite right’ maybe inviting sceptics to question whether facial hair would imprint so well given it might be predicted to lie flat on sweat drenched skin. So maybe our artist/artisan didn’t lose sleep over facial hair. He simply let the effects of super imprinting of chin and upper lip create an impression (literally!) of facial hair, not too token, not too prominent, maybe somewhat patchy and incomplete, and left it at that. Maybe there was a medieval version of Marshal Mc Luhan, who instead of insisting that “the medium is the message” came up with the reverse: “the message is the medium”.

If you think otherwise, then please state their location, and we’ll examine the relevant Shroud Scope images. Wounds have been inferred solely from the location of bloodstains, but one then sees the terms “wounds” and “bloodstains” used interchangeably as if both were present.. Here’s a typical passage from the Bucklin ‘autopsy’: “As the back image is examined, it becomes quite clear that there is a series of traumatic injuries which extend from the shoulder areas to the lower portion of the back, the buttocks, and the backs of the calves. These images are bifid and appear to have been made by some type of object applied as a whip, leaving dumbbell shaped imprints in the skin from which blood has issued. The direction of the injuries is from lateral toward medial and downward suggesting that the whip was applied by someone standing behind the individual.” But there is no imaging of “injuries”. Everyone is agreed that the scourge marks are simply blood imprints, and the same is true for the wrist (inferred nail site), the pectoral region (inferred lance site) the scalp (inferred crown of thorns site) etc etc. But what we see is entirely blood, rendering Bucklin’s use of terms like “puncture wounds” etc entirely misleading. Yet senior members of the STURP team swallowed the notion of “forensic evidence” and “wounds” hook, line and sinker. It entirely coloured their thinking about the TS, causing them to think there was a rich store of forensic evidence in the body image (as distinct from blood) that simply wasn’t/isn’t there.

There’s no major trauma involved in merely being smeared with oil, dusted with flour, then imprinted onto wet linen. It’s also worth noting that in the flour imprinting model, the blood does NOT have to be painted onto the body before the flour, OR onto the linen after imprinting. One can dust with flour, then apply blood (when it might be helpful to have a living subject adopting the right posture for simulated crucifixion so that blood trickles in all the right directions). Since the last added blood makes first contact with the linen, then the correct Adler/Heller blood before body image geometry is assured. But that is not the whole solution I grant you – since the temperarure needed to develop the flour imprint (approx 200 degrees C) would seriously degrade the blood, making it brown or black. But might not the same be said for the 1532 fire? It too would have degraded the original bloodstains, requiring them to be topped up with fresh blood (or blood substitute) which would then be on top of the body image, contrary to Adler/Heller. One possibility, as Hugh Farey pointed out, is that Adler/Heller could not have known they were testing “image fibres” simply bacause they were stripped from an image bearing region, given they were selected for being blood coloured, obscuring any image colour if present. (Have I made that clear?) Why not? Because they were restricted to working with individual fibres, taken from Rogers’ sticky tape samples but with no guarantee that a particular fibre selected had image as well as blood, whether on top or underneath.. According to the half tone effect, only a minority of fibres would have had the out of sight sub blood image coating. The chances that a “blood coated” fibre selected at random from an image zone also had image would have been slim! Takeaway message: one cannot be 100% confident in the blood before image mantra, based as it was on that statistically dubious test with individual fibres selected for blood – NOT for image colour!

As I say, what we see is a constant moving of goalposts, one that takes the attention away from what has been achieved in the best part of 5 years of research, all reported in real time, warts an’all. Forgive me if decline to play this game of moving goalposts. I’ve set out my stall, and am entitled to ask that you comment on MY research findings, not your increasingly woolly speculation David R (the R being needed to distinguish from the other David on these threads). As it happens my model DOES account for the evenness of the body image. Why do you think I introduced the initial smear with vegetable oil? It’s to provide a surface onto which the flour can lightly attach, but not too strongly. Why not? Because the next step is to shake off the surplus of flour, to leave a mere dusting of flour. Look at one of the figures in this posting and you will see an image of my hand taken immediately after shaking off the excess of flour. You are seeing an explanation for why the Shroud image is so even and homogenous. It’s a reflection of the balance of two forces – adhesion and gravity. Those forces are approximately the same all over the body during the coating process. The evenness is then captured in the thermal development of image in the oven. The approach I have taken is one of experimental model building, one you yourself challenged Richard Dawkins to perform. So why are you now belittling the very instrument that you theatrically claimed was needed to support a medieval provenance of the Shroud, above and beyond ‘mere’ radiocarbon dating. Oh, and let’s not forget the final laundering with soap and water, leaving the Stage2 TS like ‘ghost’ image. That too creates an initial impression of image homogeneity (though fortunately not too homogeneous: if that were the case there could be no 3 D properties, given the latter depend on differences in image density, something to bear in mind before setting up “homogeneity” as a crucial characteristic of the TS. Let’s not confuse general faintness with homogeneity). Sorry, I’m not impressed with your style of advocacy, David R, eloquent thought it may be. I believe it to be excessively influenced by your religious convictions, of which I have no problems per se, having been brought up in a church attending family. It’s just that science and religion do not mix. Science is a means of tackling problems via falsification of hypotheses, not an ideology. So let’s hear how you think the flour imprinting model can be falsified if this dialogue is to continue.

Let’s start by taking up just two. You refer to the forensic evidence regarding crucifixion. That area in the hands of pathologist Robert Bucklin MD was clearly a major influence on a number of STURP investigators even before they travelled to Turin. That includes, notably, John Heller, though you have to go almost to the last page of his book to see the evidence of his being enamoured of the Bucklin “autopsy” report (shame it was done on an Enrie black and white negative theatrically placed on a mortuary trolley or similar). The fact is, David, that there is NO forensic evidence whatsoever. Why not? Because the entire evidence for crucifixion and associated torture and trauma rests entirely on those bloodstains, and the TS body image is NOT a photograph, so cannot be “read” as if one when the mechanism of imaging is unknown. What’s more, there is no imaging of the punctured or torn flesh whatsoever. That includes all those 372 alleged scourge marks. All are said to be represented by blood imprints only, amazingly uniform ones, while displaying in amazing detail the details of 3 or so different classes of flagrum tips (lead spheres etc).How can the image of a real victim of crucifixion be so perfectly imprinted, with just the right amount of blood for imprinting, not too little, not too much? Then there’s your reference to a “burial” shroud. I see no evidence in scripture that Joseph of Aramathea’s “fine linen” was ever used, or intended to be used as a “burial” shroud. It was used simply for respectful transport of a naked bloodied corpse from cross to tomb, where it was then replaced with more specialized burial garments (John’s account, differing from the synoptics since it restricts itself to what happened post arrival at the tomb). I maintain that the fabricators of the Shroud (14th century France) were influenced by the legend of the Veil of Veronica, then attracting hordes of pilgrims (Avignon presumably) and wished to trump it by representing a sweat/blood imprint of an entire body, front and back on linen, which visiting pilgrims would view (with verbal prompts) as Joseph of Arimathea’s fine linen used in transport mode, NOT as a burial shroud. Their perceived task was clear: to simulate a sweat/blood imprint, and that they did brilliantly and near flawlessly, provided one does not go looking for imprints of wounds as distinct from blood, or evidence of sides or top of head, or hair imprinting differently, whether macro or microscopically, from bare skin etc etc. Thank you for your interest David. You are of course right about the lack of curiosity re details on the part of the sceptics, though whether they really comprise your 99.99% is maybe open to question I would have put it at 80 85% myself, with a sizeable number believing there is still room for doubt, especially as rarely a year goes by without some new claim for authenticity based on a new “scientific” insights, and not just a trashing of the radiocarbon dating. Indeed, it was Paolo Di Lazzaro’s laser pulse modelling that got me actively involved, some 30 years after reading that Sunday Times colour supplement that appeared at the same time as your “Silent Witness”, attempting to give scientific credulity to the case for authenticity (and most persuasive it was too, though less so now). Yes, the TS is good. That’s the trouble. It’s simply too good, too manicured in so many ways to be genuine. And it can now be modelled after a fashion, as I hope my researches demonstrate, while acknowledging there’s a lot of detail still to be resolved re precise mechanism of imprinting, especially the order in which blood and body image were acquired (or kn the case of blood, re acquired in centuries of repair and restoration)..","date":"2016-08-22","mins":"5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/08/16/might-invisible-ink-technology-mere-childs-play-have-been-superbly-fine-tuned-to-achieve-whole-body-imaging/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Might invisible ink technology (mere child’s play) have been superbly fine-tuned to achieve whole body imaging?"},{"id":"comment-7639","author":"colin_berry","post":"I have just googled “the greatest conjuring trick in history” to find one, just ONE return.

Instead of using ordinary plain flour, which may self filter/absorb to some extent allowing only a small fraction of exudate to reach the perforations, one uses a dried pasta e.g. Spaghetti instead. Yes – seriously. Pasta is 100% durum wheat semolina – made from the inner part of the durum wheat grain, so essentially no different from ordinary flour in terms of composition, except for a somewhat higher protein content. To ensure better drainage, one crushes the pasta in a pestle and mortar, sieves out and discards the finer particles, then uses the resulting grit as one’s substitute for fine flour. As that bed starts to ‘sweat’ on heating, any liquid exudate should find it easy to drain through the large spaces between the grits, down to those perforations and out into one’s collecting vessel. The ultimate aim I guess is to collect the exudate and deploy it as a kind of paint or dye on linen to see how closely or otherwise the result resembles or differs from the TS body image in terms of superficiality, microscopic properties etc. The uv/visible reflectance spectrum would be of interest too, providing I can find a lab prepared to collaborate, to compare with the STURP data.

It is after all only formed wheat flour dough that has been shaped and dried, But I shan’t, since the exoperiment designed to substitute pasta for flour was not about modelling the TS body image as such.. It was designed to explore the mechanism of imaging, in particular whether a liquid exudate might account for the peculiar microscopic properties of the image (superficiality, half tone effect, discontinuities etc).. My fear was that my perforated tray, designed to let liquid trickle through onto linen or cotton wool might let too many solid flour particles through as well – thus the suggestion of using chunky ground up pasta that is still 100% wheat flour in composition (ignoring small amounts of water). In fact I need not have worried, Such is the tendency of flour particles to clump together that very few fall through the perforations, and the model system is starting to work as predicted, with the top layer of cotton wool acquiring a yellow or brown coloration that might be due to egress of liquid, as predicted, or there again maybe vapour or a combination of both. The next step is to test my top layer of discolored cotton wool etc. With my new chemical reagent, see second update at top of posting, one that turns image areas on linen from brown to yellow, and see whether or not I get the same colour chage in the filtered system where the flour has scarcely if any direct contact with the fibres during the oven heating stage. What I’m doing in essence is attempting to differentiate between a contact scorch and an action at a distance chemical stain/thermally generated dye. Matching the microscopic properties of the TS body image has to be seen as the ultimate test of any model system, dare one say prize, since authenticists as far as I’m aware have advanced no explanation, unless it’s “Well, that’s what flashes of radiation/putrefying amine vapours/corona discharges/ neutron emissions from the bowels of the earth etc/etc do, don’t they”, to which the answer is “Where’s the evidence?”.

If the plant fibres discolored similar to the previous work with direct contact, it would support the idea of a hot migrating liquid being the true imaging medium. So cotton wool (for starters) was placed in a shallow glass bowl. Aluminium foil was then perforated with a hundred or so tiny pricks from a needle, and placed on top of the cotton wool, with the edgesof the Al foil raised to make a shallow tray. The tray was loaded with white flour and a few drops of oil added on top. After heating to 200 degrees C approx, and removal from oven, the flour was dark brown, as expected, and the top 1cm or so of the cotton wool was considerably discolored (a brownish colour).

You see, I think the ‘starch story’ to be a total diversion from the relevant science re the Shroud image. I believe that story (fantasy?) came about because a chemist – and a highly competent one at that – tried to take on too much, and strayed into areas outside his expertise. He failed to consult with scientists in other relevant specialities. Had he done so, and consulted with botanists about the strippable image layer, he might have picked up on the existence of something called the ‘primary cell wall’ (PCW). I have read quite a lot of Rogers’ work, and secondary reports thereof, and do you know – I cannot find a single scrap of evidence that Rogers was aware of its existence as the most superficial component of the bast (stem) fibres of flax. That’s why he tried to explain strippability in terms of an acquired layer of impurities – but was content to give second hand evidence for the presence of “traces” of starch e.g. From the work of Mc Crone etc, and what’s more, starch from image regions, when he should have concentrated on non image regions that should have had more (unreacted) starch according to his hypothesis. Sorry, I can’t be bothered to think about starch or saponins etc etc when every single bast fibre from flax has a primary cell wall that is choc a bloc full of chemically reactive , easily pyrolysable non cellulosic hemicelluloses, lignin etc. If Rogers were here today i would tell him to his face to drop his fixation with starch, saponin and the rest of Pliny’s ragbag of 1st century AD processing additives etc until he had conclusively proved that the imaging did NOT involve the carbohydrates etc of the PCW..","date":"2013-01-02","mins":"6:56 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/more-thoughts-on-the-fragility-of-image-bearing-fibres-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"anoxie","title":"More thoughts on the fragility of image-bearing fibres on the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-7806","author":"colin_berry","post":"Yes, David, but did you see what Hugh Farey had to say about the conventional oh so de riguer peer review process in his most recent BSTS newsletter (re the demise of Dan Porter’s shroudstory site): http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n82part9.pdf I agree with him entirely.

I’ll leave it to Adrie to comment on your first point re retrograded starch – despite my being closely acquainted with it from a previous research project on enzyme resistant starch. When I started this topic, quoting the multi author Fanti et al paper, my thoughts were more on image superficiality in quantitative terms – notably that 200nm thickness – or as Adrie has pointed out – 200+/ 200 nm. The chemical nature of the substrate – PCW as against Rogers’ largely hypothetical starch coating – was not in my mind. What was in my mind was the insistence of Fanti, Di Lazzaro and others that an image layer that was a mere 200nm thick was not explainable in terms of conventional energy sources and required exotic energy inputs – corona discharges, coherent short wave energy from uv excimer lasers etc. I initially looked at ‘thermostencilling’ with infrared/visible radiation, using charcoal as a photosensitizer, but quickly dropped that in favour of plain old heat conduction from a hot template, zero air gap (stiill my position). But since starch coatings have been invoked (endlessly and indeed monotonously),largely irrelevant in terms of Maillard reactions, and of dubious relevance in terms of simple pyrolysis, I’d simply say this. Neither Rogers nor his modern day disciples, one in particular, should ever have embraced the starch coating idea without first marshalling convincing arguments why the PCW is not the prime candidate as superficial image bearing layer.

There is another explanation for the cut off peripheries of the face, and it’s nothing to do with colour variations in the yarn, and everything to do with the mechanism of image imprinting, But I’m not here to debate technical matters – not any more. I’m thinking of setting up a new site that will specifically address this and the rest of Shroudology’s received wisdom, which all too often strikes me as little more than tendentious pseudo scientific twaddle. And no, I will not be intimidated by “Fourier transforms” and similar injections of computer mumbo jumbo, which in this instance has contributed precisely nothing.

Link to banding It claims that the gauntness of the face is due to the presence of “darker” bands of linen that effectively narrow the image (presumably by obscuring image). Firstly, the image shown is the as is Shroud image (a pseudo negative) but light/dark restored positive obtained on a silver salt emulsion, so the putative bands are not darker bands, but lighter bands, contrary to what is stated. But more importantly, the blogger has omitted to consider the implications of the scorched in crease mark at approx beard level. If a band had influenced the intensity of the image, making part of it seem to be invisible, or scarcely visible, then it should have affected the scorched in crease mark too. But it did not – the latter with its twin track appearance looks roughly the same all the way acroos, including the right and left cheeks. What seems more probable is that the non imprinted regions are little if anything to do with the colour of the yarn. They represent parts of a statue or bas relief template that failed to imprint – the most likely reason being that plane of the metal was sub optimal relative to linen to have pressure and close contact, and consequently less intense scorching..","date":"2012-03-13","mins":"5:24 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/23/one-very-good-reason-why-the-turin-shroud-could-not-possibly-have-been-produced-by-scorching-onto-linen-and-10-even-better-ones-why-it-could/","cat":"barrie_schwortz","title":"One very good reason why the Turin Shroud could not POSSIBLY have been produced by scorching onto linen – and 10 even better ones why it could."},{"id":"comment-1371","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks Hugh. I’m glad I’m not the only one who is nonplussed by the man’s ideas – and that’s putting it mildly. Just two observations. His claim that the Second Law applies only to non interacting particles is a new one on me. A law is a law, and is supposed to relate to phenomena without knowing the details of mechanism, certainly not at the atomic or sub atomic level. I went to the wiki entry on the Second Law to see if I could find a clue. There is a section there on attempts to rationalize the Second Law, and it includes a theoretical treatment that starts by assuming ideal gas behaviour (i.e. Non interacting particles) in which Boltzmann makes an appearance. Methinks that our friend has maybe conflated a law on the one hand, and a mechanistic analysis of that law. They are of course separate things. Secondly, he cannot make an exemption for “chemical reactions”. What is chemistry if not interacting particles? Again, I think the Second Law is blind to whether one is dealing with interacting or non interacting particles, whatever the context. As for the particular context of star formation, where is the problem? Certainly there is a decrease in entropy when hydrogen atoms are attracted to each other under gravitational attraction, and a further decrease when they fuse to form helium nuclei. But those entropy decreases are more than negated by the entropy increases that accompany star formation. There is the gradual acquisition of kinetic energy when the hydrogen atoms/molecules are attracted to each other, with collision, followed by conversion of kinetic energy to heat and light radiation. The latter streaming off into space must surely represent an increase in entropy. Then you have the emission of heat and light when nuclear fusion occurs – again – another increase in entropy that makes the overall process for the complete system a large positive one, more than compensating for the decrease in entropy due to particle condensation. Similar considerations apply to evolution, with the difference that the entire shebang is solar powered, and results in constant release of waste heat and gases that drives the process, more than compensating for the increase in molecular order and organization.

It is the rigid lid of a sarcophagus propped up at an angle. The pattern on the lid is a stepped pyramid, probably intended to represent a mosaic of some kind, and the little circles form L shapes more by accident than design (and why would an illustrator want to show burn holes on Joseph of Arimathea’s newly acquired acquired length of expensive linen?). The illustrator makes liberal use of little circles in the other line drawings too. There is some fabric sitting on that lid, possibly a nominal shroud, or less probably the separate head cloth.

When one suggests that it is a scorch, one is told that the Shroud image is far too faint and superficial to be a mundane scorch. Yet when it comes to explaining the embarrassing gap in the Shroud’s history between the 1st and 14th century AD we are told that for part of that period at least it was on display as the Mandylion, albeit face only, inspiring and informing generations of artists as to the “real” appearance of Christ (beard, moustache, long hair etc). So the image was considered intense enough to warrant framing and displaying as the Mandylion, but not intense enough to have been produced by a resourceful manufacturer of made to order medieval icons. Yet another instance methinks of everlasting cake – the kind that can be saved yet devoured simultaneously. Seriously I have no insights into the question as to why things look the way they do, centuries after their first appearance. Certainly the initial image may have faded, due maybe to addition of active oxygen species (hydroxyl, hydroperoxy free radicals, singlet oxygen etc) across conjugated diene chromophores, resulting in less intense absorption of blue light, less yellow colour. (I have found that 6% w/v hydrogen peroxide solution can bleach the faintest scorches – but not the more intense ones). Alternatively, as some have suggested, as the the linen itself yellows with age, there is correspondingly less contrast between image and non image areas. If as I believe the Shroud image was originally intended to convey graphically the idea of a hot corpse leaving its signature on linen (you may place whatever construction you wish on who was depicted, and the mechanism of imprinting) then the artist may well have aimed for a light as scorch as possible – while still visible from a few paces. Why? Because as I have suggested before, the crucial consideration may have been the need for ambiguity – because ambiguity generates an air of mystery. If the scorch is too intense, folk would simply dismiss it as a hot metal brand. Make it too faint and they won’t see it. Make it sepia coloured, and folk will ask themselves: am I seeing a faint scorch from heat? Or is it a faint STAIN from some kind of chemical interaction between a corpse and cloth. If ambiguity was deliberate, as I suspect, then it was spectacularly successful, given that radiation versus contact scorching versus chemical Maillard reactions are still being discussed as alternatives to this day, some 660 years after the first recorded display in a remote French village in 1355. (Doesn’t say a great deal for STURP/STERA probing, does it?). One thing’s for certain. The image must have been intense enough to attract pilgrims in 1355, willing to part with money in order to take back home with them the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge… But the badge does NOT show the classical image of the crucified Christ, or even a typical Christ like figure. What it does show is a matter of conjecture… I say it is that of a tortured Knight Templar, before or after slow roasting, as was the ignominious fate of Jacques de Molay, Geoffroi de Charney and others whom we now describe as the last of the Knights Templar..","date":"2012-09-03","mins":"11:16 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/is-the-man-on-the-turin-shroud-a-pseudo-negative-imprint-from-a-death-mask-could-that-be-why-the-modern-day-photographic-negative-looks-so-much-better-than-the-original/","cat":"corona_discharge","title":"Is the Man on the Turin Shroud a pseudo-negative imprint from a DEATH MASK?

There one is up against the time honoured human predilection to have one’s cake and eat it. I refer to the constant taunts that come my way that a scorch does not meet the criterion of superficiality (less than 200nm thick we are told). When I say that a scorch can be as superficial as one wishes, right down to the limits of detection by the human eye, back they come and say that my scorch HAS TO BE fluorescent, just like the (non superficial) 1532 burn marks. Methinks they need to be consistent if they wish to be taken seriously. Constantly ducking and diving simply to score sparring points may help pass the time of day on internet forums, but it ain’t science – or even serious debate. Repeat: I say that the Shroud image is a highly superficial scorch, far too superficial to show fluorescent properties. If there are those who dislike my position, then all they need do for starters is prove me wrong on the fluorescence.

Matthias. “We find in France, then, as part of this elaborate cult of the dead the practice of forming a death mask of the deceased king. Nor did the death mask serve directly to hand down to posterity the features of a great man. The death mask is simply a technical aid in modelling the face of the effigies. It is this, the wax image of a living man, contrasting strangely with the mortal remains of the dead, which interests alike the artist and the public. But the death mask is a mere by product in the concern of the survivors for the dead. It was not till the beginning of the fifteenth century that the grasp of reality was accepted as the aesthetic norm in the artistic production of Europe. It is therefore almost safe to assert that we shall not meet with the death mask before that period. In fact it is on the death of Charles VI. Of France in 1422 that we first hear how Maitre Francois d’Orleans, court painter since 1408, made a death mask, as well as models of the hands and feet, from the corpse for the purpose of a magnificent image. Thus it is possible to prove by means of written records the use of the death mask in the preparations for the strange funeral ceremonies of all French kings of the Quattrocento, with the sole exception of Louis XI. (1461 83).” http://www.undyingfaces.com/info/death mask history/ So there are two crucial points. Firstly, death masks did not really become acceptable until the “start of the 15th century”, which is some 50 years after the first reported exhibition of the Shroud in Lirey, and then for royalty only. But that was on account of a shift in cultural norms we are told, in which folk gradually became accustomed to the shock value of a replica taken from a deceased individual. So while it might appear at first sight that a Shroud image produced via a death mask replica was somewhat before its time, though not greatly, let’s not forget that it was not the 3 D or semi 3 D death mask per se that was on display, but simply a faint 2 D sepia image that while recognizable as a man, and probably a deceased one, had little or none of the ghoulish quality of a 3 D death mask. In fact, it is not that the technology did not exist prior to the 15th century. The technology for producing a death mask had been in existence for millennia, it being used by goldsmiths and bronze makers etc, for example, to produce accurate replicas of things like plants, animals, people. Note that I am thinking of the Shroud having first been produced as a tribute to a Templar martyr, maybe a nuanced tribute but with no overt attempt to hoodwink. If on the other hand it had been a medieval forgery, i.e. Intended to be accepted from the word go as Christ’s burial Shroud (which I think improbable in view of the understated Lirey badge) then I doubt that the forger would have been unduly bothered by the charge that he was exhibiting an anachronistic indifference to the cultural or artistic norms of his era … As I say, the death mask was probably just an intermediary stage… with few pilgrims so much as suspecting that it had played a key role….","date":"2012-09-01","mins":"2:25 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/08/26/is-the-man-on-the-turin-shroud-a-pseudo-negative-imprint-from-a-death-mask-could-that-be-why-the-modern-day-photographic-negative-looks-so-much-better-than-the-original/","cat":"corona_discharge","title":"Is the Man on the Turin Shroud a pseudo-negative imprint from a DEATH MASK?

Thomasset. Http://jaanet.info/journals/jaa/Vol 5 No 1 June 2017/3.pdf The title is “An Osseous Remain on the Face of the Shroud”. “Osseous remain” is another term for bone, human bone, composed of calcium phosphate etc. The authors attempt to explain it in pro authenticity terms (injury inflicted on the nose of the crucified Jesus). I have an alternative explanation. The trickiest aspect of imprinting off a real person is the face, due mainly to the angularity of the nose. It creates creases in the fabric. Prof. Luigi Garlaschelli (not my favourite scientist – he fails to respond to my emails!) has suggested that a bas relief was used for the face, and for the face only, and up till now I have aligned myself with that view – albeit somewhat reluctantly. . An alternative possibility now presents itself, but be warned, it’s not for the faint hearted. A corpse was used to imprint the entire body, head as well as torso and limbs. How did they get round the problem of the nose? They flattened it – with a heavy object, and in the process damaged bone and cartilage, one – but only one – fragment of which was left on our simulated sweat/blood imprint of medieval provenance, as per the radiocarbon dating, the one that was originally the Shroud of Lirey, near Troyes, France, now the Shroud of Turin. So that’s two useful inputs from our highly observant and methodical microscopy friends in Paris, both from that sticky tape sample taken from a “bloodstain” on the right eyebrow – reddish yellow clay serving as Mark 1 blood (see comments immediately preceding this one) AND now a fragment of bone that allows this modeller to ditch, or at any rate shelve, Luigi Garlaschelli’s bas relief suggestion. Replace “bas relief” with “bash relief” ? 😉 PS (added Sat Nov 4): extract from Mark Antonacci’s pro authenticity book, 2000:page 17 Under “Facial and Head Wounds” “On close examination, his nose, which is bruised and swollen, shows a slight deviation that indicates the cartilage may be separated from the bone. Microscopic study also reveals that scratches and dirt are on the nose. The areas above and below each eye, especially the right eye, look swollen, and the face appears to have been beaten with a hard object (such as a fist or stick) and/or injured in a fall.” One does not get a fragment of bone on a face by beating it with a fist of even a stick. One gets it by smashing it, as if porcelain, using something rather more substantial – an iron bar or a brick – creating what the paramedics call an “open fracture”… I reported an anomaly with the nose as long ago as October 2014, finding it did not respond to 3 D rendering in Image J’s ‘thermal LUT’ mode, as one might expect for prominent relief, compared with surrounding features like brow ridge etc. Http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/continued modelling of turin shroud.html Well, it wouldn’t, not if it had been a real face, a real nose, one where the latter had been hammered flat post mortem! We now have an explanation for why the SIDES of the nose are imprinted, a detail that has been alluded to time and time again in the past as crucial evidence against imprinting by physical contact. Here’s an instance from Antonacci’s book – though there are several more I could have cited: From Page 63, under “Direct Contact Theories” “… the Shroud body image was imprinted even where there must have been some distance between the cloth and body (for example the sides of the nose). When the investigators pressed the cloth onto those surface points where contact was not made during the natural draping over the face mold, the resulting image was greatly distorted…”.","date":"2017-11-03","mins":"7:03 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/pro-authenticity-shroud-investigators-should-have-considered-the-body-image-as-a-simulated-sweat-imprint-before-rushing-to-their-pseudoscience-resurrectional-incandescence-etc/","cat":"bas_relief_face","title":"Pro-authenticity Shroud investigators should have considered the body image as a SIMULATED sweat imprint – before rushing to their pseudoscience (‘resurrectional incandescence’ etc)."},{"id":"comment-10205","author":"colin_berry","post":"Have just added this quickie schematic to the end of the current posting.

I suggested there had been extensive flaking off of blood, while puzzling that unflaked off blood was congregated sludge like on the highest ribs of the herringbone weave, which does not happen when one dabs on real blood (which soaks into the weave). More to the point I puzzled the yellow brown patches that accompanied the blood, having their own distinctive stain like appearance, suggesting two entirely different components were present, apparently superimposed, which would not preclude one being underneath or on top of the other. I shall now go back and take another look, with the ‘new model’ proposed above firmly in mind, namely that the Mark 1 blood on the Shroud was a slurry of reddish coloured clay in water. That was later touched up, probably decades later, with Mark 2 blood (or “blood”) of a brighter, redder hue. It’s Mark 1 blood that has given rise to the Mc Crone mineral/iron oxide contributions not just to body image but to the blood ‘story’ and the latter (probably) to Adler/Heller’s “blood too red/porphyrin/protein” one.

Call me old fashioned or a science snob if you like, but I don’t think it is the job of a photographer cum copyright hoarder to be dictating the scientific agenda, even if he does now delude himself into thinking that 30 years of association with the Shroud now makes him a scientist. If he were a scientist, he would not be bandying around the issue of fluorescence knowing and caring nothing about the origin of the phenomenon, and merely content to use it as an errant Scud missile to demolish my case for scorching. (You can find his comments on sidekick Porter’s site – made back in February as I recall). There is no case to answer as far as I am concerned, since it is based on the false premise that if a 1532 burn mark that produced full thickness charring generates fluorochromes, notably benzenoid aromatics, then so should any thermal process that produced the Shroud image, no matter how superficial in comparison. If that is the view of Barrie Schwortz and others who deploy pseudo science in defence of authenticity, then let THEM do the necessary experiments with graduated temperatures. For my part I refuse to be drawn into phoney arguments that have no scientific underpinning. The key question, as far as I am concerned, is the precise chemical nature of the tan coloured chromophores, and whether they are modified linen carbohydrates per se or impurities. The priority is to initiate long overdue model studies, starting initially with plain linen (without those Pliny additives that so fixated Raymond Rogers!) which is then progressively heated and pyrolysed, monitoring the changes using as wide a range of physical and chemical methods as possible, and (Shroud custodians willing) comparing with the image on the Shroud. If a match can be found that stands up to close scrutiny, with no quarter given to those who attempt to dismiss on trivial or pseudo scientific grounds, then perhaps an answer can be found to the question: how could the Shroud image have been produced in medieval times, corresponding to the radiocarbon dating? I am now 99% confident that those experiments will produce an answer, with the rider that fluorescence will play a minor role if any in defining the precise conditions needed to produce the Shroud image. At the risk of repeating myself, the energy source will be verified as being thermal, more specifically heat conduction (NOT electromagnetic radiation of any kind) requiring DIRECT CONTACT (no air gap) with a hot object to be precise. The temperature will be just sufficient to produce a faint and superficial scorch on the crowns of the weave, possibly modifying cellulose fibrils, but more likely to involve selective pyrolysis of PCW associated hemicelluloses (xyloglucans etc).

(Saves me having to do my own!). I’ve printed it out on A4, speared the site of the so called poker holes with a hot needle, and confirmed that the 4 L shaped sets of holes line up almost perfectly if one first folds the paper lengthwise along its long axis, and then breadthwise along its short one. The lined up holes on all 4 layers then coincide very closely with the geometrical mid point of the twice folded paper. Those “poker holes” preceded the 1532 fire, but display the same (to my mind) unexpected feature namely that a revered ‘holy relic’ was folded up at least twice with a crease running right down the centre of the face of the Man on the Shroud! (Well, not quite the centre, but approx vertically through the subject’s left eye). I commented as much on that years ago when looking at the same symmetry of the 1532 holes, with the word “cavalier and disrespectful” in the title. At the time, I focused attention on those 1532 burn holes, giving little thought to the “similarly symmetrical “poker holes”, while thinking how improbable was that ‘official’ rarely if ever challenged poker inflicted explanation. The way the charring falls off rapidly as one goes through the 4 layers of cloth, labelled 1 4 above, hardly fits with the thrust from a hot poker, but maybe better with some kind of briefly incandescent red hot embers as also suggested, assumed to have dropped from above, e.g. A censer. Ah yes – red hot embers. Here’s an alternative explanation that you won’t have read before elsewhere. The 4 sets of “poker holes” were acquired during Shroud manufacture when the flour imprinted linen was folded in 4, and then slung horizontally , supposedly at a “safe height” (!) over a bed of red hot charcoal for image development. Embers flew up from the fire and hit the lowest part of the hammock like arrangement, i.e. The dead centre of the folded up ensemble. Damage was most severe at the first point of contact, decreasing rapidly through the next 3 layers. I’ve been experimenting with gentler roasting routines that might arguably work better if our medieval artisans had indeed folded the linen in 4 for heating and colour development. Success! One does not need 180 200 degrees C as used previously. 30 60 mins at 160 degrees is just as effective, and may avoid uneven colour with a folded sheet ( though still to be tested). It’s also much easier to wash of the detachable surface encrustation with soap and water from low temperature roasting, leaving that faint, ghostly Shroud like negative image – see blog banner….","date":"2017-10-27","mins":"8:33 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/pro-authenticity-shroud-investigators-should-have-considered-the-body-image-as-a-simulated-sweat-imprint-before-rushing-to-their-pseudoscience-resurrectional-incandescence-etc/","cat":"bas_relief_face","title":"Pro-authenticity Shroud investigators should have considered the body image as a SIMULATED sweat imprint – before rushing to their pseudoscience (‘resurrectional incandescence’ etc)."},{"id":"comment-10153","author":"colin_berry","post":"We’ve all heard of the so called ‘voyage of discovery’. For this shroudie sleuth, the last few days might be described as a voyage of rediscovery. Yes, I’ve been going back to features that were the subject of postings 4 or 5 years ago, and realizing that I did not do full justice previously to what was staring me in the face. The latest example is that Lirey Pilgrim’s badge, with that curious coiled rope like structure that is strung horizontally across the small of the back on the dorsal side AND then extending off body to both sides of the linen. Historian Ian Wilson interpreted it as the “blood belt” in which case one must ask: why show that “blood” only – in bas relief no less – and no other blood, e.g from the lance wound? Maybe it does represent a rope. But there’s no obvious rope, or depiction thereof, on the Shroud body image itself, at most a blood belt with a chain like appearance in places – hardly a coiled rope. And why does it extend across the whole width, off the body image? But aren’t we overlooking something? The designer of the Lirey badge went to a lot of trouble to show both the body and (?) rope in bas relief (which involved a lot of meticulous internal scooping out and sanding of the small stone template/mould (UK)/mold (US) used for casting the lead/tin alloy). Why did he do that, given the TS image is 2 D, not a bas relief, far less a 3 D? Why not just show the TS image as if a painting, say of the founder of Christianity on his final burial shroud, whether pre or post Resurrection? I say there are two main reasons. First he wanted to ‘educate’ the first time viewer into seeing the ‘two fold’ image as an actual body IMPRINT (most definitely NOT a painting that could be misconstrued as that of the crucified Jesus on his final burial shroud, the fabric being mistaken as mere artist’s canvas, albeit upmarket as regards intricate weave pattern). Would the negative (tone reversed image) be sufficient, and be correctly interpreted? Probably not – an the badge alone could not be used to convey a negative image. Consequently, a visual aid was considered a worthwhile insurance policy, indeed necessity, to guard against misinterpretation of the Shroud’s faint body image and/or the material on which it is placed! Repeat: the body image had to be seen as an IMPRINT, not a painting. Second , the badge designer wanted to hint at the time and place the unique imprint was acquired, i.e transport to the cross, not afterwards in a rock tomb with all the attendant ambiguity and complications (post mortem changes, resurrection). Thus the addition of a rope, yes ROPE, used to assist in the so called “Deposition”, i.e.transferring a crucified body from cross to the spread out receiving linen, herringbone weave face up – see earlier comment). The bas relief can be viewed as ‘artistic licence’ which allowed the badge designer to indicate what was there BEFORE the imprint, whether it left an imprint (the BODY) or not (a temporary lifting ROPE). In short, the rope was a way of saying: see the Shroud imprint as one acquired en route from cross to tomb, not the tomb itself. It is a transport shroud, possibly allegorical like the Veil of Veronica, and NOT be seen as the final burial shroud (to which some might take umbrage, the local bishop in the first instance, and who knows, maybe the Pope himself!). The Lirey badge ploy may have done the trick, at least for the first year or two of lucrative public displays of the ‘ailment curing’ Shroud of Lirey. Shame about its successor – for which we have the so called Machy mould only. The Mark 2 badge designer pushed his luck with that additional face and ESPECIALLY the somewhat ambiguous word SUAIRE (sweat cloth? burial shroud?) directly underneath!

Now you’re saying the image is detailed…How can a vanishing image be detailed if one cannot view it at sufficiently close quarters in order to discern detail? This might be an opportunity to make a point: there’s not just one but two competing shrouds in the literature. There’s the one that is in the glass argon filled case in Turin, the one that elicits comments like “I can scarcely see a thing!”. “Try reproducing that level of image subtlety and superficiality” they say! Then there’s the other shroud in all the archive photos, which has been given oodles of extra contrast by one means or another. “Try reproducing that level of detail and definition” they say!

These days one can do the same with digital software such that scarcely visible images leap right out the page!). Sorry, but I also reject outright the idea that one has to reproduce every detail in order to make a case for the image being man made. One has merely to show that it’s possible to produce an image that is faint yellow, superficial (or apparently so!), negative (tone reversed), exhibits the half tone effect and discontinuities under the microscope etc. In other words, one shows there’s nothing irreproducible IN PRINCIPLE, i.e. Nothing beyond known science and technology.

There will be what I regard as a new addition to that list – a feature that I don’t recall having been flagged up elsewhere. It’s to do with the briefly Gospel appearing J of A’s decision to have expensive ‘fine linen’ delivered to the cross to receive a blood and sweat covered body. The TS certainly fits the description “fine linen”, given its 3/1 herringbone weave. But that fancy patterned weave is only visible on one side (the side with visible threads being 75% warp origin) – the opposite side being allegedly much less attractive (75% weft threads). So the herringbone weave would need to have been visible to spectators on the OUTWARD non body contact side right? But which side was visible to spectators, given the image is imprinted on the herringbone weave? NOT the herringbone weave!. So the choice of herringbone weave was unlikely to have been J of A’s (authenticity scenario). It was more likely that of the medieval artisans who decided to model/simulate his improvised stretcher means of transport – having discovered no doubt that apart from the quality look (“fine linen”), one can get a much better imprint onto a herringbone weave with those more elevated flat top multi platform warp threads than on a simple 1/1 weave!

Idea no.27 has given a particular sense of satisfaction, linking together as it has a seemingly disparate collection of features: the symmetrical distribution of the L shaped so called “poker holes” about the vertical midline, the repeated resort to ‘disrespectful’ folding of the TS down its vertical (longitudinal) midline for compact storage (as distinct from rolling up) , creating a crease down the centre of the supposedly ‘revered’ face, the method of manufacture/ image development of the body image assuming medieval provenance, the manner of compact folding of the linen during proposed thermal image development, the risks of deploying a bed of hot charcoal for image development etc etc. Yes, there’s a way of linking them all into a simple, coherent, internally consistent narrative – and not before time.

One can put up a title, and a mere introduction for starters, giving a hint of what’s to follow in bite size instalments. That’s what I shall now proceed to do. The title of the next posting? “The Turin Shroud – conceived and manufactured in the mid 14th century as a vastly more REALISTIC Relics U Like upgrade of the celebrated Veil of Veronica.” But that’s not saying anything I haven’t said before these past 3 years of a 6 year hands on project to unearth the truth regarding that so called burial shroud. (Which it’s not, being better described as a simulated TRANSPORT shroud – modelled on the Joseph of Arimathea intervention, i.e.his providing fine linen to receive a newly deceased victim of crucifixion straight from the cross while blood AND sweat were still reasonably fresh and thus EACH able simultaneously to deposit an IMPRINT, one bold, the other faint). However, this worm has finally turned. This worm will no longer be content to idly observe that his off message explanation for the Shroud has failed to gain traction, despite 6 years of posting on this internet site, on his sciencebuzz site too, despite numerous postings to say nothing of some 2000 comments to the retired Dan Porter shroudstory site, despite a handy summary by (sadly now departing) Editor Hugh Farey in his May 2015 BSTS Newsletter, making reference to the ‘simulated sweat imprint’. The issue is no longer about where the message has appeared. It’s about where it has NOT appeared and WHY! No prize for guessing btw which sites are within my sights, so to speak. Like, you know, shroud.com, like shroudenigma.com, like the TS wiki entry, where I appeared briefly only to be quickly edited out … need I continue?

Were that the case, there would surely be something in the historical record about churches or cathedrals performing such Easter rituals with much duplication of the imprinting technology. But pilgrims in the mid 1350s were not flocking to a major centre with a church or cathedral. They were descending on a remote hamlet with a humble private chapel belonging to the Lord of Lirey and his wife, added to which there’s written evidence (d’Arcis memorandum etc) that the Shroud was claimed from the very beginning to be the genuine article, with no suggestion that there were other ‘genuine’ shrouds elsewhere.

It would have needed only a single duplicate elsewhere to call into question the perceived ‘genuinness’ of the faked relic.

I did an earlier one with those same three words in the title as long ago as November 2014 – yes, almost three years ago! I referred to my posting, somewhat tongue in cheek, as representing something of a ‘paradigm shift’, not only for me personally (having previously been hung up on the idea that the TS was a scorch imprint off a hot metal template – Model 2) but for sindonology too – having failed to find the concept of a simulated sweat imprint i.e.of medieval manufacture – anywhere in the literature. Response: I was instantly criticized by one of sindonology’s elder statesmen for deploying that term ‘paradigm shift’, though reasons were not given. However, give the ZERO RESPONSE from sindonology to the arrival of a brand new ‘take’, i.e. Concept, these last three years and indeed longer (starting early 2014 in fact) I now feel fully vindicated and justified in claiming to have introduced a ‘paradigm shift’. It hardly speaks well of sindonology as a supposedly academic discipline, indeed a self styled branch of ‘science’ if/when it continues to ignore a significant new addition to the world of ideas. I’ve invited comments to this current posting on a long established open access site, one that still gets on average 20 30 visits a day from all over the world. So far, there’s been one only. Hopefully there will be more in the coming days and weeks. However, there seems little point in continuing to post new content unless or until sindonology wakes up to the presence of the ‘simulated sweat imprint’ concept, nay paradigm shift in its own back yard. Rest assured I will continue to do hands on research with a view to improving the performance of my current Model 10 (use of white flour imprinting medium to simulate an ancient, dried on, yellowed sweat imprint), and plan new postings. But the first priority is to elicit feedback, whether positive or negative. One cannot be expected to operate in a vacuum, especially if/when one suspects that the vacuum is no accident – that mainstream sindonology is deliberately pretending one does not exist. Late postscript: here’s a list of the model numbers 1 10 in chronological order, starting with Model 1 (thermostencilling in Dec 2011) and ending in current Model 10 (midsummer, 2015) Model 1. Thermostencilling (the one and only ‘pure’ radiation model, quickly dismissed as impractical). See this from Dec 2011: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/turin shroud could it have been.html Model 2. Scorching off a heated metal template, with nothing else apart from linen. (Finally abandoned for mainly practical reasons, but it gave valuable insights into the 3 D properties of thermal imprints). See this from Nov 2013. Https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/a challenging scorch assignment that i had been putting off and off and off/ Model 3. As above, with thermosensitizer coating, notably white flour (a forerunner of the final Model 10). I had initially tested starch, glucose etc , surprisingly with little success. It may have been this which sowed the idea that there needed to be something else present. Ray Rogers’ focus on Maillard reactions helped, substituting protein for his volatile putrefaction amines. See this from Oct 2014: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/modelling shroud of turin image with.html NB: There was a brief jump in Model 3 to current Model 10! (a horse brass was smeared in oil, dusted with white flour, then pressed onto dry linen. Shame it wasn’t wet linen, that would have given a better imprint, and allowed one to skip Models 4 8! But scientific models, let’s remind ourselves, are for using, not believing. Even models one knows to be deficient or even downright wrong can lead to new experimentation, new insights, better models…) Model 4. Wet imprinting with natural dyes, notably tannins, with added viscosity agents, essentially as described by Joe Accetta. See this from March 2015 http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/can that weird and wonderful turin.html Model 5. Sulphuric acid, flagged up by any number of previous investigators – Luigi Garlaschelli, Joe Nickell, Hugh Farey (private communication) , the idea being that acids might have etching/discoloring effect on linen. Result: negligible discoloration, profound weakening of fabric at ordinary temps, no obvious coloration without applied heat. See this from April 2015: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/what happens if you spill battery acid.html Model 6: Substitution of nitric for sulphuric acid, first with plain linen, then flour coated linen (another forerunner of final model 10). Probably the most informative experiment of all, assisted by critical input from Adrie van de Hoeven, inasmuch as protein was implicated as a potential source of image chromophore, focussing initially on the traces of protein intrinsic to linen, then moving onto extraneous sources of protein coating, then finally dispensing altogether with nitric acid as developing agent, and replacing with oven heating to produce Maillard reactions. (Yes, an echo there of Rogers, but in his pro authenticity thinking, he had perforce to introduce some less probable sources of amino nitrogen and reducing sugars (decaying corpse and 1st century technical starch or soap coatings as a somewhat improbable source of reducing sugars). See this from May 2015: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/modelling turin shroud my flournitric.html Model 7. Quicklime. A longshot, using the thermochemical reaction between Ca O and water as source of in situ heat, but quickly abandoned. See this from June 2014: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/first test of quicklime hypothesis.html Model 8. Lemon juice, with ascorbic acid (not citric acid) as the active ingredient – basically invisible ink methodology. Probably operates via a Maillard reaction between (a) a constituent 4 carbon reducing sugar – threose – derived from thermal decompostion of ascorbic acid and (b) amino compounds. See this from October 2014: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/modelling shroud of turin image with.html Model 9: Imprinting with wet flour slurry onto dry linen then oven roasting. Criticized for giving imprints that were too well defined at edges.

I have been deliberately holding back on producing the third and final instalment of the uv series. Why the delay? Well, it was to be focused on the preferred Mark 2 imaging system, the one that is boldly promoted in this blog site’s banner, i.e. The white flour imprinting model. I’ve been deliberating on how the methodology can be presented more as physical and chemical science, less as cookery, and think I have the answer. There are three and only three ways of delivering thermal energy to linen and any acquired image imprint: conduction, convection and radiation. The last of those has been ruled out of contention in any number of previous postings. Sorry John Jackson, Paolo di Lazzaro etc. Conduction? The Mark 1 technology, imprinting off a hot metal template, bas relief or fully 3 D, relied on heat conduction. I persisted with it, despite (or because of) a lot of misleading or ill informed criticism that need not concern us now, and only shelved it (temporarily to start with) when following up Joseph Accetta’s ideas on wet imprinting with acidic dyes, mordants etc. That finally led to the current Mark 2 model, using dry flour on human skin, imprinted onto wet linen. It’s the details of the oven heating stage that are now under the spotlight. Thus far, the wet imprinted linen has been laid flat on a metal baking tray before being placed in a fan oven (supplying blown/convected hot air). I suspect that the metal actually protects the linen (conducting away heat) while allowing the hot air to gently toast the flour imprint (via Maillard reaction etc). What’s needed, before testing for presence or absence of uv fluorescence, is a control system that dispenses with thee metal tray, which suspends the linen in the oven such that heat is supplied by hot air alone. That system might be described approximately as “thermal energy transfer via convection (natural or forced) alone”. That’s the practical side of the programme. There’s also, as mentioned earlier, a “blood” posting in preparation. Admittedly with the wisdom of hindsight, or so it may seem, it will detail how the blood testing should have been done to get a less equivocal answer. Miniaturized tlc separation of methyl esterified porphyrins, visualized by their pink or red fluorescence under uv, and run against authentic porphyrin standards, will be the proposed technology. This retired biomedical scientist was seeing those attractive porphyrin bands on tlc (thin layer chromatography) back in 1972 when analysing phototherapy bile for bilirubin photo derivatives. Bilirubin and other bile poigments are closely related to porphyrins needless to say, being linear (ring opened) tetrapyrroles rather than cyclic closed loop variety. Both the porphyrins and the bile pigments retain the two propionic acid side chains that can be methyl esterified to render the molecule less polar and more mobile on tlc.

First thought, however: have you considered interposing a sheet of plain glass to get a partial filtration of UV A from UV B? From wiki: Ordinary window glass passes about 90% of the light above 350 nm, but blocks over 90% of the light below 300 nm. One wonders if your uv source emits mainly longer wavelength UV A initially, and then progressively more UV B as it heats up (?). If that were the case, the glass might prevent, or at any rate attenuate the progression from red to green yellow fluorescence. It may be something to do with pyrolysis producing more or less polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) with increasing scorch or char temperature, the PAH fluorescing red under UV A, the less pyrolysed products on the fringes needing higher energy UV B to fluoresce yellow green. But don’t let any of my “musings” (thanks Jim Carney) cramp your style… Yup. To that other matter: any thoughts on my latest de Charny/ King John “ransom” idea?

It has to be the best ‘why do things look the way they do? think pieces since Hugh Farey’s on banding (had to say that to preserve balance). Even if there was a single shred, nay fibre, of scientifically based validity to the flaked off paint assumption (which there’s not) it could easily be discarded by reference to another aspect of the TS image that I don’t suppose our tunnel vision historian friend has given a moment’s consideration (that’s assuming he even knows about it). I refer to the image’s so called non directional character. To be painted as such, the artist would have had to abandon any idea of directional light casting the light and shade that gives form to images. It seems scarcely possible he could do that, or even have a reason to do that. So what if he painted a conventional image employing different gray values of pigments to achieve contrast between light and dark. For flaking to have produced the present non directional image, there would not only have to have been selective flaking off of the darker pigments that represent shade but their subsequent migration and attachment to the lighter zones to achieve some kind of equalization effect, and somehow manage to evade chemical detection. The term I believe for all of that is wild fantasy. Ever so slightly more realistically (so as to match those boring old facts) the process of shedding flakes would have needed to somehow ‘cook’ or chemically etch the underlying linen fibres to achieve the right chemistry that resulted not only in chemical dehydration and superficial yellowing of the carbohydrates, as deduced by STURP from spectral and chemical properties, but also their mechanical weakening in image bearing zones (recalling the greater ease of stripping off image fibres with the Mylar sticky tape). The sorcerer’s apprentice in Disney’s Fantasia could maybe have done that, but it’s hard to think of other candidates.

However, ask anyone where they are most likely to encounter a scorch and it’s probably from ironing clothes, where it’s direct physical contact between hot metal and fabric that is a prerequisite. There are other types of contact scorch too, like leaving a lighted cigarette on furniture or fabric. Some might mention radiation scorches, like attempting to dry wet clothes too quickly or too closely to an electric fire. However, one can introduce a little science by considering the chemical nature of the discoloration that we call a scorch. It’s due to chemical reactions at the surface fibres of the fabrics caused by excessively high temperatures that cause chemical bonds to break and then reform in new configurations that absorb light of higher frequencies (the blue end of the visible spectrum) such that reflected light has a yellow tinge (remove blue and the residual mix tends to look yellow). Generally in the instances described the discoloration is somewhat superficial and while unsightly does not materially affect the strength of the fabric. Do these very faint and superficial scorches fluoresce under uv light? I personally don’t know, not having a scientific grade uv lamp. (Yes, I could buy a cheapo version on e Bay, but would not trust results if there were no indication of what kind of uv frequencies were being emitted, quite apart from the risk of damaging one’s eyes in home experiments without safeguards, mine having already been over exposed to uv from a photochemical project early in my career that left permanent retinal scarring, or so my optician says). What I do know is that the 1532 damage to the TS can in no way be described merely as a “scorch” as described above. It’s better described as charring, with a scorched margin. The chemical changes that produce charring, leading ultimately to charcoal, i.e. Elemental carbon, introduce an entirely new range of exotic chemical species, notably the polycyclic aromatic compounds along the way to graphitic fused benzene rings. The latter are known to fluoresce strongly under uv light for a number of reasons to do with delocalised pi bonds, rigidity of planar ring systems etc etc. Forgive me if this biomedical scientist with a grounding in organic chemistry does not buy into the argument that because the 1532 “scorch” marks fluoresce under uv, and the TS image does not, then ipso facto the TS image cannot be a scorch mark. Anyone intending to play the fluorescence card to those of us familiar with organic chemistry must first place all their other cards on the table, like those that reveal the chemical identities of the fluorescing species. Fluorescence per se is hugely unreliable as a guide to process (as I learned to my cost in that same photochemical project, wasting well over 6 months chasing fluorescence on TLC plates, based on someone else’s assurance that “that is where the money is”.

Https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis Superficial scorching of fabric is pyrolysis, not combustion (no flame). However, that does not mean there is no oxidation.There may be a little, but the ultimate end products of high temperature pyrolysis of organic compounds invariably include solid carbon as charcoal. Superficial scorching, produced at lower temperatures, produces a quite different range of chemical products from combustion, some of them as chemically complex if not more so than the starting materials such as carbohydrate polymers. In combustion, the carbon all ends up as gaseous products, primarily CO2 obviously, maybe with a little CO and other volatiles (like your formaldehyde etc). Furfural however is a typical pyrolysis product of pentosan (5 carbon) sugars.

The 1532 fire produced full thickness charring and burn holes. Not only does that need a much higher temperature than superficial scorching from a heated template, but the 3 D geometry of heat conduction would have been entirely different. Heat would have been conducted away from the blackened zone in the plane of the cloth, ie. Along the central cores of flax fibres. Put another way, the faintest areas that you describe as scorches received thermal energy laterally via the celiulose cores of the fibres. That’s an entirely different geometry from receiving heat from the surface, especially at lower temperatures that produce little or no damage to the cellulose cores. Different temperatures, different geometry of heat conduction result in different chemistry, and to end products that differ in their physical and chemical properties.

One can nitpick if not liking that conclusion, given it makes life a little more difficult for forgers if they can’t simply paint blood onto the linen after imprinting the body image. For my part I provisionally accept the blood first ‘dogma’ since it does not present an insuperable problem to a forger. Why not? There are at least two ways round the problem, maybe more, which can be used if imprinting with powdered white flour onto wet linen (my Model 10!). The first is to sprinkle the flour onto the oil smeared subject first, then paint or dribble the blood (or “blood”?) onto the flour coated skin, then imprint onto the wet linen. The blood goes onto the linen first, meeting the Adler/Heller claim. But there’s a problem – the blood would look nothing like blood after the oven roasting stage for image development! There’s an alternative means which I strongly suspect was used for the site (at least) of the lance blood. One uses an offcut of linen to protect a sizeable patch of skin from being coated with flour. One then does the oven roasting stage, and then and only then one paints blood onto the blank area of the linen. That could explain how the area is said to show water as well as blood, as required for strict biblical ‘authenticity’. Of course, it’s not really “water” one sees mixed in with blood, evaporated water being invisible but small patches of blank linen, free of yellow body image! Clever these medievals! I’m not sure if the masking technique would work with all the blood stains, especially the more intricate ones like those on the arms etc. Uv fluorescence? Nope, I doubt if the intensity of uv light is a major factor, though wavelength might be. Personally I think it was a mistake on the part of Barrie Schwortz and others to make statements like “all scorches fluoresce under uv” when based purely on the weak pinkish red fluorescence of the charred edges of the 1532 burn holes. Those edges are not experimental scorches, using the term in its broadest sense to mean linen that has acquired a thermal imprint by one means or another. Those edges have been exposed to far higher temperatures (800 degrees of more) if the molten silver reliquary narrative is correct, compared with the temperatures required for my flour imprinting model (180 to 200 degrees C) or the slightly higher ones used in my now abandoned direct contact Model 2 using a heated bas relief. None of my thermal imprints, whether one stage “scorches” or two step flour imprints show any fluorescence whatsoever under uv, so the attempts by promoters of authenticity to dismiss thermal imprinting out of hand via fluorescence simply don’t stand up to experimental test. It’s simply empty propaganda if the truth be told. I hope that helps. Don’t hesitate to keep the the questions flowing.

I think I’m now able to explain the ‘second face’ in a way that is backed up with experimental data. See my current posting dated July 1 : “My Model 10 – thermal imprinting with white flour onto linen – can account for the curious properties of the Turin Shroud body image” Previously I thought it was a mechanism operating entirely from the imprinted side, relying on capillary transport in the narrow channels between the closely packed linen fibres within each linen thread. I’ve now had to revise that view. I now think there’s something going on INSIDE each linen fibre, maybe involving even narrower capillary channels between cellulose microfibrils within linen fibres (maybe not) and that effects of oven heat on the most superficial hottest parts of the reverse side of the linen are activating that mechanism so as to produce the second reverse face image. See my latest photomicrograph copied/pasted from the end to the start of the posting. In short, the ‘second face’ effect depends on simultaneous heat BOTH sides of the linen: a preponderance of heat reaching the reverse side of the linen favours a more intense reverse side image as can be shown experimentally using different geometries inside the oven as regards position of linen relative to source of oven heat. These are early days experimentally – there is much more to be done. For now, let me leave you and other site visitors with this thought: if the reverse side image on the newly created Shroud was anything like my model system, then it comprised highly superficial coloured fibres mixed in with many uncoloured ones, giving an overall impression of faint straw colour. But those coloured fibres were fragile and brittle, and over the centuries many will have snapped off as a result of handling and fallen away, leaving the merest hint of reverse side colour that we see today! For all we know, the early owners of the Shroud did not care for the reverse side image, and may have hastened its disappearance with gentle brushing, snapping off those brittle reverse side fibres! That reverse side image, or rather modelling thereof, is providing a valuable and unexpected research tool – but I’m not expecting ‘sindonology’ to display the slightest interest, whether at Pasco next week or thereafter. Sindonology has no time – and indeed nothing but contempt – for any thinking that does not presuppose a 1st century provenance and authenticity.

The rot began to set in with the 1981 STURP summary*, the background to which can be found towards the end of John Heller’s 1983 book on his involvement with the STURP project. Wild and inaccurate ‘acid fixated’ chemical speculation involving atmospheric oxygen, essentially mimicking the natural ageing of linen cellulose, was promoted in the STURP Summary as if established fact, discouraging more promising lines of experimental modelling, notably those involving THERM Ochemical as distinct from mere chemical ones.Then the propaganda started against anything that could be tagged as a “scorch hypothesis”, with the ludicrous claim that “all scorches fluoresce under uv”. It’s time that someone started to set the record straight. I guess that someone will have to be me. * See this passage in particular: “The scientific concensus (sic) is that the image was produced by something which resulted in oxidation, dehydration and conjugation of the polysaccharide structure of the microfibrils of the linen itself. Such changes can be duplicated in the laboratory by certain chemical and physical processes. A similar type of change in linen can be obtained by sulfuric acid or heat.”.","date":"2017-04-06","mins":"11:16 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/comment-promoted-what-are-we-to-make-of-the-second-face-on-the-reverse-side-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Comment promoted: what are we to make of the second face on the reverse side of the Turin Shroud?"},{"id":"comment-8833","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thanks Matt.

Are you still looking in? If so, here’s a progress report. I’ve listed some 27 points – see below – re STURP’s performance (plus later authenticity promoting ‘sindonologists’) that I consider represent a hugely irritating and frustrating non enlightenment as regards the nature of the Turin Shroud. Let’s not mince our words: most could have been avoided by more careful selection and screening of personnel, more objective, less bedazzled by things such as so called “encoded 3 D properties” (just one of many instances of galloping pseudoscience)). My next posting, to be started at the weekend, will take each of those 27 points from the outline skeleton and develop them more fully. It will take days, probably weeks, to do justice to them all, but I’ve decided to make it a single posting. To keep length to a tolerable minimum there will be a few images only (I may decide to set up a separate image archive elsewhere, having 2 other semi dormant websites to choose from). Here we are: 27 points (maybe more to come!): 1. Dispensing with the cylindrical, wrap around distortion objection to imprinting via direct contact. 2. Addressing the claim that blood not really on the hair, used in Trojan horse strategy to claim image and blood are out of stereoregister, then used to implicate radiation as imaging mechanism 3. Failure to recognize that ‘neck crease’ is no ordinary crease, failure to appreciate the clue it provides to imprinting mechanism that utilizes direct contact and applied pressure. 4. Failure to consider the evidence for thermal imprinting mechanism, indeed contemptuous dismissal thereof. Failure to do experiments with model scorch imprinting (3d, bas relief etc). 5. Failure of STURP to recognize that blood stains are too good to be true. Coroner Robert Bucklin’s inability to recognize that blood stains cannot necessarily be equated with wounds. 6. Failure to recognize that a subset of bloodstains – the scourge marks – are also too good to be true, with near perfect imprinting of the metal bead tips of one or more Roman flagra. 7. The radiocarbon dating: why the opposition to repeat testing (St.Louis conference, 2014) coming from STURP team leader and other big shot attendees at Discussion forum no less. 8. The ‘just a painting’ nonsense from someone with no scientific credentials and scarcely any significant ones as a historian either. Shame on ‘History Today’ for allowing that shallow, ill informed nonsense into the public domain. 9. STURP’s failure to prioritize, to go to Turin with one or more positive models. 10. STURP’s failure to ensure proper sampling methods for blood and body image. Rogers’ fait accompli re “Mylar sticky tape” and the severe practical problems it posed for himself and others, notably those charged with blood testing. 11. STURP’s failure to properly characterize the presence of authentic human porphyrin, despite late recruiting of porphyrin specialist Alan Adler. Adler’s self re invention as a physiology/medicine expert re blood clotting, liver metabolism etc. Ouch, 12. The premature embrace of radiation models, ones that go beyond any known science (like auto emission of electromagnetic or nuclear radiation from a corpse). 13. The cursory attempt to dismiss any kind of imprinting by direct contact, based on self serving models. 14. Failure to grasp the implications of the negative image. 15. Gross overhyping of so called ‘encoded 3 D properties’. Failure to experiment with model imprints that would distinguish between 3 D properties and 3 D response in computer software programmed to read and re map image density as height on an imaginary z axis with virtual shadowing as an optional 3 D enhancing extra. 16. Failure to recognize that the TS was seen by early viewers as a body IMPRINT left on J of A’s linen by SWEAT and blood, and could thus have been designed as such in the 14th century. 17. Failure by STURP and later sindonologists to recognize that the biblical account does not permit one to assume that the linen, whether authentic or not, was used and intended as a BURIAL shroud, when its purpose was probably for improvised ‘stretcher’ ‘/bodybag’ transport between cross and tomb. 18. Overhyping of alleged image superficiality, the justification for resort to radiation, lasers etc. Failure to place microscopic transverse sections of threads or even single fibres into the public domain, assuming (optimistically) they were ever part of the experimental protocol. 19. Attempts to use uv fluorescence or lack thereof – with no experimental data – as a means of dismissing the ‘scorch hypothesis’ (some scorches? all scorches? all thermal imprinting mechanisms?). Meaning of “scorch”? 20. Certain of the more over hyped aspects of the “blood stain” story, like why the blood looks too red to be authentic blood (“extraordinary levels of bilirubin”) , the ‘blood before image’ mantra etc etc. Unrealistic scenarios re behaviour of detached blood clots etc. 21. Heller and Adler’s failure to recognize the real significance of their important diimide bleaching finding. Its use to inflict an over dogmatic identification of the image chromophore as “conjugated carbonyl” with an untested oxidation model, failing to recognize that double bond formation is achievable by chemical dehydration of sugars alone, not needing oxidation. Inappropriate unrealistic model for chemical dehydration (conc. H2 SO4) that sidelined thermal dehydration. Assumption that cellulose is the only target for fibre coloration, ignoring other endogenous or exogenous compounds. 22. Rogers’ alternative Maillard hypothesis. Pros and cons. Inappropriate deployment of 60 degrees C in his model system, having claimed his Maillard chemistry would work at rock cave temperatures. Failure to make clear how starch can serve as source for “reducing sugar”; questionable substitution of dextrins (semi hydrolysed starch) for starch in model system. How quietly tweaked self serving models risk undermining research credentials. 23. Ill judged attempts to substitute chemical for radiocarbon clocks by Rogers (vanillin) and Fanti (spectral changes, mechanical strength testing) all of which are invalidated if image formation required an oven heating stage (accelerated ageing). 24. To be announced later. 25. Rogers’ inadequately documented claim for blood hydroxyproline as a marker for Shroud having not been exposed to heat. Likely confusion between blood and connective tissue collagen etc., between free and protein incorporated hydroxyproline. 26. Rogers’ claim for crystalline supposedly ‘native ordered’ cellulose as a marker for Shroud linen not having been exposed to heat. Failure to recognize phenomenon of retrogradation (i.e recrystallization after ‘melting’) as pointed out by Adrie van der Hoeven. 27. The controversial involvement of microscopist Walter Mc Crone, with claims that the body image could be entirely accounted for as paint pigment, notably red ochre (iron oxide). Failure of STURP to shoot that down at the earliest opportunity with the diimide finding, allowing the mistaken notion to take root, surviving to the present day as the risible attention seeking pseudo scientific, pseudo historical ‘just a painting’ dross..","date":"2017-04-05","mins":"9:49 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/comment-promoted-what-are-we-to-make-of-the-second-face-on-the-reverse-side-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"Comment promoted: what are we to make of the second face on the reverse side of the Turin Shroud?"},{"id":"comment-91690","author":"colin_berry","post":"Thibault HEIMBURGER : Warning (again): the Enrie and Durante photographs are sometimes misleading.

There’s certainly no colour plate showing sepia coloured fibres on the reverse side, and as far as one can make out the evidence is all indirect. Some of that evidence is questionable in my view (while having no expertise in image analysis). For example, we are told that when one colours up the front side of linen with graphite, one cannot see any black shape when viewing from the opposite side. Ipso facto, we are told, the reverse side image is not merely a weaker penetrating form of the front side image. But much depends on the background surface on which the fabric is placed, whether it’s white and reflective or not, as I discovered and reported some time ago. Note the faint reverse side image on the left. It’s entirely artefactual, and is due to bleed through from the reverse side. Examine the faint image through a hand lens and one finds the colour is entirely in the interstices of the weave, which as we know are just holes. How can holes be coloured? There’s a simple explanation, as my photograph on the right shows. White lights enters the fabric from the reverse side, and exits from the opposite side as red light, due to abstraction by the marker pen ink of certain non red frequencies, as ne can see from the patch of red light on the white background. But that red light can be back reflected, and return to the viewer’s eye through the interstices of the weave, giving rise to that faint reverse side image. However, place the fabric down on a black background, and the reverse side image disappears from view! Why? No more back reflection! Maybe Fanti’s test with the graphite was unfortunate, having chosen a very black substance that would abstract ALL the frequencies of white light, so that back reflection would be that of modestly attenuated white light that might be difficult to spot, even on a white background. If his background had been dark he could not have expected to see the outline of the graphite at all, at least not via the interstices route described (though I make no claim that is the only path for back reflected light). He should have chosen something other than black for his penetration test, and looked for colour! Speaking of which – colour that is – there’s no substitute for a good colour photograph taken at a hand lens level of magnification.

But they can subsequently recrystallize on cooling, returning to something like their original structure, or “retrograding” like starch to new ordered structures that still retain a high degree of crystallinity. I personally am not au fait with phase changes in cellulose, but suspect that so highly ordered and chemically resistant a substance retains or even REGAINS – most if not all of its native crystallinity up to temperatures that are not too far short of those that produce pyrolysis and scorching , i.e. Close to 300 degrees C, but the latter are some 60 80 degrees higher than those that pyrolyse the hemicelluloses of the PCW. Rogers claim that temperatures that pyrolyse linen must irreversibly modify cellulose is I believe a matter of some conjecture. It might have carried more weight if he had mentioned the PCW and its more susceptible hemicelluloses, instead of putting all his speculative eggs in Pliny’s starch fragments/soapwort surface impurities basket, thus creating that theoretical basket case 😉 known as the Maillard browning theory. Selective scorching of the PCW hemicelluloses not only explains why cellulose can escape modification, provided that a temperature is chosen that gives just a faint scorch, but at one and the same time accounts for the exceptional superficiality of the Shroud image, and faint scorch marks in general, if confined to the PCW.

Yes, I too would like even higher resolution photographs of the Shroud, but am grateful that Mario Latendresse alerted me to the Shroud Scope pictures when he did. I’m surprised that so little use has been made of them so far. When did you hear of their existence? Not from my posting surely, given they have been available since the middle of last year (as I recall)? However, with some 125 postings now on the Shroud, I am in no mood to let the details, interesting though they are, cause me to take my eye off the ball. I am now wholly convinced there was a systematic attempt by key members of STURP and many others to eliminate contact scorching aka thermal imprinting as an image mechanism with scarcely any attempt at serious scrutiny. We now have the unedifying sight of so called scientists lining up to say that it fails to match a superficiality criterion (<200nm) – one that rests on little more than one man’s failure to see something well when immersed in adhesive tape ‘goo’ under a light microscope. More so called ‘scientists’ have since piled in, claiming without a shred of theoretical or experimental evidence that a scorch can never be as superficial as the image on the Shroud. That so called scientists should engage in this kind of misinformation, nay, DISINFORMATION, is quite simply scandalous.

I’ll give that a try. His template was basically just two tiers of metal, separated by a shallow vertical ridge. There was no subtlety there – no smooth rounded contours around which the linen could drape, and he was not always pressing into a soft underlay. Is it any wonder that there is excessive contrast between the images intensities of those two planes? To reject scorching with so minimalist a template does not strike me as scientifically prudent – given the kind of work I have been publishing these last few months – see banner – where there is no problem whatsoever re excessive contrast between adjacent planes. In any case, folk have often pointed out that the prominences of the Shroud face, especially nose, chin, beard etc are exceptionally well imaged … it’s simply a case of managing the template, pressure, underlay etc to get an acceptable image.

There is a world of difference between those two terms and image forming mechanisms.. THERM Ography offers a explanation for the negative character of the Shroud image, encoded 3 D information, confinement to the more superficial parts of the weave etc. PHOT Ography explains nothing. It is merely a lazy (and erroneous) assumption that Secondo Pia’s positive photographic image must have been derived from a PHOT Ographic (pseudo)negative. If Jones is dying to unveil a new theory of proto photography, then let him do it sooner rather than later. In the meantime, I shall give short shrift to Jones or anyone else who bandies around a term that I consider to be highly misleading (and self serving too, if the user feels it excuses them from having to discuss the specifics of image properties and formation). Btw: how can ordinary visible white light degrade linen? Or do you include ultraviolet in your reference to “light”? If so, how was that uv radiation brought to a focus in a way that could produce an image? These are all questions that I have addressed in earlier postings, with the conclusion that I see no role whatsoever for light or any kind of electromagnetic radiation where the Shroud is concerned (except maybe for generalised background yellowing of the linen over decades and centuries, but with no image formation)..","date":"2012-10-12","mins":"1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

I’d need to know exactly how those chemical imprinting tests were done, and what precisely was the role of light and/or filters and stencils (if any) before venturing any comment, far less criticism. As for hot brass statues, I’ve never been terribly keen on that idea, unless there had been one of a crucified Christ that had been damaged, say, and for which someone was attempting to find a use as an alternative to selling for scrap. I suspect there is more mileage with thermal imprinting from sections cast with Plaster of Paris. They could have been made from a real corpse (in theory a living subject too) using death mask technology that has been around probably for millennia. The temperatures needed are nowhere near red heat, btw: somewhere between 200 and 250 Celsius, probably nearer the latter, being sufficient to produce a reasonably distinct sepia coloured scorch. If one is a medieval forger, one does not go to the trouble of producing a one off thermal imprint, outwith conventional artistic practice, unless there is a compelling reason to make the image LOOK LIKE A SCORCH. As I’ve said before, I believe the “unique and relevant” answer to that conundrum lies in the Templar connection, especially with De Molay’s gruesome execution (and preceding crucifixion?) and that of De Charney and other leading Templars. That order may have been stripped of most of its vast wealth, but there were probably still funds, or maybe later donations, that were available for creating a unique and compelling memento, with the focus on HEAT. A scorched memento may have been considered an apt visual metaphor, given that roasting/burning at the stake left nothing at the end to which mourners could pay their respects except charred fragments and ashes (and some sources say they were usually removed by ghoulish spectators taking them home as souvenirs)..","date":"2012-10-12","mins":"6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/12/stephen-jones-bsc-grad-dip-ed-persists-in-his-mistaken-belief-that-the-shroud-image-is-a-photograph-wheres-the-scientific-evidence/","cat":"junk_science","title":"Stephen Jones BSc.

The crucial one for now is the fluorescence. You say you it was green. The fluorescence around the Shroud 1532 scorch marks was described by one of the STURP team as red, as I recall. I also wonder what kind of chemical change, could produce any kind of fluorescence – if indeed it is chemical, whether green or red if it appears at temperatures below those that produce visible scorching. Suppose it’s simply an effect of dehydration? Is adsorbed moisture acting as a fluorescence quencher? Drive off the moisture – and up pops the fluorescence due to modern linen additives – fabric brighteners etc. ? Suppose you simply place in an oven set at 100 degrees C? Does that produce green fluorescence? Have you seen red fluorescence at any temperature? Nope, I shan’t be there tomorrow at Beaconsfield, and to be candid won’t be hankering to be associated with the BSTS either – not while one of its members is harrying, sorry “challenging” Richard Dawkins – or anyone else for that matter – to prove the Shroud is a fake.

Science, at least in its preliminary stages, is not helped either by having folk, least of all “gifted amateurs” attend conferences with a view to hammering out “consensus statements”. Shroud studies are over burdened with too much unchallengeable dogma as it is, without crystallizing it into consensus statements.

But the pdf paper in question did not use a bas relief. It used a very basic template consisting merely of two flat planes only. So while there may have been no gradation of intensity in your tests with that template, as I pointed out back in 2012, those findings are totally irrelevant (and frankly misleading).

Excessive uv is undesirable, certainly, increasing rates of skin cancer, decreased crop yields etc, But we already know and protect ourselves from excessive exposure to sunshine. So let’s not go scare mongering, even retroactively, or devaluing the term “apocalypse”. Or maybe that term is linked in with another agenda. I’m always somewhat suspicious of those who consider their opinions to justify the writing of an entire book, especially the vanity self published variety. If it’s a really good and original idea, it should need no more than a 1000 words or so at most. I personally try to limit my ideas to blog postings, and even (more recently) to comments on other people’s sites. Whether the ideas are good or bad remains to be seen. Dan and his postings seems to see some use for them, if only as eye candy. The truth will out, as they say.

There is no need whatsoever to invoke any kind of radiation.

Now if you think this is a game, xxxxxxxx, or that I am pushing a “pet academic theory” then so be it. I prefer to think that I have made a sincere and honest attempt to establish the truth regarding something billed as the most intensively studied object in history. Anyone with a hot coin and a piece of cotton or linen can simulate the scientific principle that underpins the Turin Shroud. With care they can produce a highly superficial image which affects only the outermost cell walls of the cloth, probably the primary cell wall hemicellulose, which is light/dark reversed, which has encoded 3 D information, which will almost certainly fade with time and so forth. There is no need to invoke magic where the Shroud image is concerned. To claim it defies modern science is complete and utter poppycock. The Shroud has become a symbol of pseudo scientific misinformation, indeed, in some cases, deliberate disinformation. I think I can safely say my work is done. I have stated my hypothesis, one that rationalises the image in terms of accessible, conventional science. I leave it to others to fine tune the technology, if they so desire.

Second postscript added 1st March “eureka with a small e moment! It was not a sand bed those medieval hoaxers used. Sand does not provide enough give – and moist sand does not provide sufficient cooling to prevent discoloration on the reverse side of the linen. I now think it was a bed of SNOW. It seems obvious now, but here’s what led up to the sudden realization that snow ticks more boxes than sand. I was looking at the reverse side discoloration today through a lens, and realizing that it was totally different in character from the frontal side scorch. The latter is highly localised, mainly to the crowns of the threads, scarcely intruding laterally beyond the contact area, whereas the reverse side is a diffuse and very lightly toasted looking colour. Why would that be I wondered. Then the penny suddenly dropped. I have so far been considering only 2 of the 3 methods of heat transfer – conduction (favoured) and radiation (rejected). But there’s a third method which I suspect caused the reverse side toasted appearance – CONVECTION. When the hot template is pressed against linen, air in the pores of the linen becomes superheated, but can only escape by crossing the thickness of the fabric to escape on the far side (into my sand bed). En route it physically and then chemically dehydrates the fibres. By substituting snow for sand, I suspect, nay predict, that the secondary “roasting” from hot convected air will be much reduced. What’s more, snow will make for a much better medium into which the template can snuggle down to get optimal contact between cloth and template – not too little, not too much. Too little and there is insufficient 3 D effect; too much and there is distortion through converting too much of the relief into a planar image. Trouble is, I don’t have snow to hand to test this idea (the UK is having an unseasonably mild winter right now). I could probably use crushed ice as a substitute – to provide the cooling effect that will reduce “convection scorch”, but it won’t have quite the same give as snow for optimal wrap around effect. Never mind – it is that reverse side discoloration that is my main focus at present with a view to ticking one more box on matching model with Shroud (though let’s not forget that the latter also has a reverse side image of the face and hands)..","date":"2012-03-01","mins":"10:57 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/the-turin-shroud-man-is-a-scorchograph-and-i-challenge-anyone-to-prove-otherwise/","cat":"barrie_schwortz","title":"The Turin Shroud Man is not a photograph, but a negative THERMOGRAPH – and I challenge anyone to prove otherwise…"},{"id":"comment-36","author":"colin_berry","post":"So where does one go from here? It’s difficult to be critical of a model when there are no credible alternatives, and I have to say that none of the alternatives I have encountered – gaseous diffusion of putrefaction chemicals, corona discharges, miraculous flashes of light, strike me as being in the least bit credible. So for now, at any rate, it’s a case of seeing how the principle works in practice, the principle being that the image was produced by “branding”, aka thermal imprinting, aka scorchography. The main obstacle that has to be overcome, surely, is one of getting linen to conform to the contours of one’s template, without too much “tenting”, i.e.becoming stretched in a straight line between prominent features. In fact, if one looks at the Shroud, it’s clear there was considerable tenting. It is especially noticeable in the area around the crossed hands and forearms, which is only to be expected. Given those appendages and limbs would represent one of the highest points on a torso when supine. How could tenting have been reduced? As suggested earlier, I believe that the statue or bas reliefwas pushed downwards into linen overlying a bed of sand. What’s more I believe there is a tell tale signature of this configuration being used, which are the two prominent creases in the linen at the top of the head and the chin. I doubt whether those creases would have been tolerated, had they been visible in a “head up” configuration, and were only discovered after lifting the template from a sand bed or similar. I believe there is another tell tale sign of tenting – the absence of ears and indeed of the side aspect of the face much beyond the prominent cheek bones. I suspect that is because the template had the representation of hair in cast metal,which not only accounts for the unnatural “hanging dead straight down” look but gave rise to some tenting, with the consequent failure to image the sides of the face. A representation of hair in cast metal obvious cannot compress down in the way that real hair can. More later.

To say the whole thing looks distinctly fishy would be a gross understatement: Shroud Damage in 1532 Fire The fire in the Castle Chapel 1532 – 4 December – Fire breaks out in the Sainte Chapelle, Chambéry, seriously damaging all its furnishings and fittings. Because where the Shroud is kept is protected by four locks, Canon Philibert Lambert and two Franciscans summon the help of a blacksmith to prise open the grille. By the time they succeed, Margaret of Austria’s casket has been melted beyond repair by the intense heat. But the Shroud folded inside is preserved except for having been scorched and holed by a drop of molten silver that fell on one corner 1534 – 15 April – Cardinal Louis de Gorrevod holds canonical investigation at Chambery at which three bishops and ten noblemen testify to the cloth before them being the same as that they knew before the fire. According to the Cardinal ‘It is the same sheet as we ourselves before the fire have many times held in our hands, seen, touched and shown to the people’ ” Amazing, eh, that the casket is “melted beyond repair “ by the extreme heat” yet just one molten blob has dripped down onto the Shroud, with the latter having been strangely been folded down its midline. Here’s that earlier post of mine showing where a single blob of “molten silver” can penetrate to obliterate not just one but both shoulder regions: one single hole is all it took And there was an inquiry in the aftermath, we are told, that involved 3 bishops and 10 noblemen – no less – and it centres on the Shroud, and whether a substitution had been made in the aftermath of the fire, presumed to have begun accidentally(?) Oh my. What suspicious minds they had in those days … Oh, and here’s what the Lone Ranger enthusiast had to say about melting (or trying to melt) silver. “Then we tried to melt the silver. Given its high melting point, we were also concerned about oxidation. Dr. Jaansalu also informed me that molten silver has a tendency to absorb air, which not only hardens the metal but may cause it to spit, pop, and splatter when pouring. Getting splattered with molten silver doesn’t sound like much fun. Rather than using a flux, he suggests that we rig a second Bunsen burner to create a reducing environment. I was delighted to have someone more knowledgeable than myself making such decisions. The apparatus was very pretty. The main burner gave off the traditional bright blue flame, which turned magenta as it lapped around the ring stand and crucible. The brass diffuser of the upper burner gave its flame a bright green color. Overall, it looked like some fantastic Olympic torch. With two burners running wide open, we placed five ounces of silver bullion in the crucible, and waited. And waited. And waited. Despite its considerable aesthetic appeal, this apparatus was unable to get hot enough to actually melt the silver.”.","date":"2012-02-26","mins":"3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/the-turin-shroud-man-is-a-scorchograph-and-i-challenge-anyone-to-prove-otherwise/","cat":"barrie_schwortz","title":"The Turin Shroud Man is not a photograph, but a negative THERMOGRAPH – and I challenge anyone to prove otherwise…"},{"id":"comment-37","author":"colin_berry","post":"Health warning: what follows is strong stuff – not suitable for those of a nervous disposition. It began with a discussion on the other site (see sidebar) about those elongated bony fingers. I was accused of failing to grasp the implication – namely that the entire Shroud had been the result of imprinting by x rays similar perhaps to the kind of thinking from that ENSA group with their uv laser beams, but going even into even more energetic, indeed penetrating electromagnetic frequencies (“soft” x rays). Strange some might think how one can take x rays of the hands but not the feet, but let’s not get too hung up on the small details. What follows now is a train of thought that began with my “scorchograph” theory, which envisages a metallic template, used like a “branding iron”, e.g. A bronze statue or bas relief of the crucified Christ, and explores the numerous implications of that hypothesis, ever on the lookout for new ways of rationalizing things that have previously defied explanation, or which give clues to new things to investigate (all theories to be useful need to have predictive utility). Right, let’s begin. We’ll suppose for starters that it was a bronze statue that had to be detached from a cross. What folk would have seen, looking up at the statue, would be the nailed hands (or wrists). Looking up at anything creates a foreshortening effect that can be artistically distracting or worse. Architects certainly sometimes compensate for it – as with the Parthenon in Athens where the pillars are splayed slightly outwards. I believe that the fingers on the statue were made deliberately too long in order to compensate for foreshortening – and arguably to create a better artistic effect anyway, perhaps suggesting that the hands had been stretched under the weight of the body – even if anatomically improbable. What about the boniness? We see on the Shroud the imprint of the BACK of the hands, not the front, so the “sculptor” (perhaps not the best term for someone who casts in bronze, but the original template would have been carved, say in wax) may not have been too concerned about appearances. Indeed a ribbed construction may have been deliberate “round the back” of the hands and fingers for added stiffness and strength, making them less liable to be snapped off in transit. But the arms in the statue are in the outstretched position – that is the first thing that has to be attended to if producing a hoax Shroud. The arms have to be sawn off, and will be displayed the other way round, preserving the modesty of the man. Ah yes, modesty. There was no doubt a loin cloth on the statue. But could that remain in place? Unlikely. Even if it could be left without occasioning comment ( “surely it would not have been needed inside a shroud?”) it would not look right on a supine individual. Cast metal, made to look like a piece of cloth, would not hang right, would it?). So the loin cloth had to go BUT ONLY ON THE FRONT– it would have been filed away. If you think that is improbable, then take another look at the Shroud image, and look at all the scarcely imaged region in and around the hands and lower forearms. Yes, it could represent tenting of fabric, but the latter would have been accentuated by the loss of additional metal loincloth in that area. As for the dorsal image – I have a hunch that the loin cloth was NOT filed away on the back. That would have presented difficulties – better to leave some impression of buttocks than none at all. Leaving the loin cloth in place would explain the dense image in that area, and the poorly imaged region immediately underneath (which others have commented upon), which would have been due to a stepped effect from one level down to another with consequent tenting. Now do you see where those long bony fingers came from? They are the result of using a recycled statue instead of a customised template. But there’s more iconoclasm to come. Kindly fasten your seat belts. Cutting the arms off a statue, and repositioning them, even with the aid, say, of some temporary lead solder, is going to be difficult to look right, even on a “scorchograph”. Did the Mark 1 version attract some scepticism of suggestions of high jinx? Yes, I believe it did, but so much reputation and credibility had been invested in that “holy relic” by then that drastic steps were called for. Here’s what was done. The Shroud was folded down its centre (long axis) – hardly the way to treat a holy relic, as I pointed out in an earlier post – but desperate measures were called for. The folding ensured that one of those problematic shoulder regions lay directly above the other – as a result of folding symmetry. Some test probes were done with a red hot poker, to check on the methodology for obliterating embarrassing defects in manufacture. Molten metal was then dripped carefully onto the shoulder region, in the certainty it would burn through to the one underneath, destroying the image in both junctions of arm and collar bone. Once that was done the Shroud was lightly roasted to get scorching around the edge. The Castle Chapel of Chambery then became the seat of a devastating and intense fire in 1532, hot enough, we are told, to melt the silver reliquary which contained the Shroud (folded conveniently down its midline remember). There’s only one thing wrong with that story. It is inconceivable that a fire would be hot enough to melt silver (962 degrees C approx) without charring the entire contents of the reliquary to a crisp. Later i could provide a link to a website in which someone tried to cast silver bullets, and found that he was unable to melt silver even with two roaring Bunsen burners trained on the metal. He finally had to resort to a muffle furnace (cue suggestions that the Chapel acted as a giant muffle furnace). Using a silver alloy, e.g. Sterling silver, 92.5% silver, 7.5%copper, effects only a fairly modest reduction in melting point (to 893 degrees C). Sorry, but this science bod simply does not buy that story that it was molten silver that did the damage, and if that version of events given was incorrect, then what else can be believe? Incidentally, to those who will cite the evidence that the “L shaped poker holes” were there before the 1533 burn holes, and show the pictorial evidence from an earlier 16th C. Copy of the Shroud, none of the scenario above would preclude those strange poker holes being there months, possibly years before the main ones as an experiment. However, the fact they lie on or very close to the scorched fold lines would surely suggest that all the holes arrived at the same time. Or maybe the alignment is just a coincidence. Maybe the L shaped holes were the result of a previous mishap, but may have given someone the idea of using hot metal deliberately to char and destroy a carefully selected part of the image area.

And you – what is your contribution to the blogosphere – outwith this SPECIALIST site? How many sites have you set up? Misrepresentation is, and always has been, the name of the game here – like Dan’s claiming above that I denied the existence of banding. I did nothing of the sort. I simply said it was not the primary reason for the bilateral loss of peripheral image – and indeed Barrie Schwortz’s photo enhancement, shown above, with raising of the luminance on the B/W photograph (which incidentally is equivalent to lowering the luminance on the actual Shroud image) without the need for Fourier transforms should serve to prove my point. The Fourier transforms are being used to window dress a dud hypothesis that is full of self contradictions, like that crease I mentioned. The dud hypothesis (banding) simply attempts to preempt discussion as to the real reasons for bilateral loss of peripheral image symmetrically on both sides of the face – which is more likely a result of the imprinting mechanism, NOT the banding.

In a latest documentary on the Shroud by the History Channel, scientists in all Christian denominations reconstruct the Face of the Man in the shroud using all the latest scientific equipments, facilities and methods in the area. It just shows how Christians are in deep longing on seeing the Face of Christ.” Oh dear, oh dear, or dear – and he’s a Chemistry graduate we’re told, so should be able to distinguish between science and pseudo science.

Once they have calibrated their different model systems, they can hol those settings, and then, and only then, try them out on the Shroud image to see how it responds.

Like for example: the Shroud image is said to be highly superficial. 200nm is the figure that is usually quoted, which is a guesstimate (odd that it’s not known with greater precision, and still depends on that Rogers experiment with the sticky tape where he says he cannot see the ghosts in cross section – the latter being the yellow “coating” on the fibres after the fibres are pulled away from adhesive, and must therefore be thinner than the smallest wavelength in visible light). Let’s take 200nm as the thickness. Is that really a starch coating as Rogers claimed, quoting (or misquoting) Pliny and with scarcely a shred of experimental evidence to support that assumption. Suppose Rogers were correct and it was a sizing coat of starch. Then you would not expect a chemical reaction on that coating to affect the mechanical strength of the thread. But we are told that image bearing fibres are mechanically weaker than non image fibres – they break more easily. Why should that be? There is an alternative to the image being in an added coating. It might be intrinsic to the fibre itself, needing no starch. That is most likely to be the primary cell wall of flax fibres. While I have no definite information re their thickness, 200nm seems the right ball park, which is still exceedingly thin, compared with the diameter of the entire fibre. So it’s still uncertain why chemical change in so thin a surface layer, comprising a mix of non crystalline cellulose and hemicelluloses. Mechanical weakening suggests that the image fibres must have weakened cellulose cores as well, not enough to be visible, and not enough (according to Rogers) to disturb their crystallinity as judged by birefringence under cross polaroids. Well, my hunch is that has to be some subtle kind of damage to weaken the entire fibres, and if that’s the case then it was caused by something that did more than leave its signature purely on a 200nm surface coating. That would tend to rule out any mild chemical agents that came into contact with the linen. Thus my focus in the past on scorching, where that term has been seen mainly in terms of thermally induced pyrolysis, i.e. Chemical dehydration of carbohydrates. But there are other ways of producing chemical dehydration, for example by contact with dilute involatile acids (sulphuric being the best known, though there are others) which become concentrated as the water evaporates, and then able to abstract water chemically from carbohydrates. So while scorching from a heated template is an obvious mechanism, it’s possible to envisage alternative that are a little more subtle. Garlaschelli’s imaginative modelling of the shroud image used ochre (iron oxide) to capture and imprint the 3 D features of real people onto linen, but if you read his paper carefully you’ll see that the ochre imprinted cloth was subsequently baked in an oven. Hot ochre may have produced local scorching at the points of contact. Or maybe the ochre had acid contaminants that produced a local dehydration/pyrolysis at points of contact, leaving the rest of the linen relatively unscathed. There are entirely different models too, as Hugh has pointed one. One that I’m currently thinking about was the practice of embalming Crusaders who had died in combat and transporting them back to Europe in a preserved state. Might that have generated an image on linen, either during transport or at a later drying out stage, again via a chemical dehydration mechanism? Anyway, I have chuntered on for far too long, and shall now break off to see what kind of flak awaits me on the other websites I frequent.

The pyramids were both royal tombs and religious temples, where the spirit — or “ka” — of the dead pharaoh could be worshipped. … besides making pottery, the people of the ancient world also enjoyed painting. Evidences of early paintings can be found in the tombs of Egypt. These tombs contained statues and paintings of servants, who were believed to come alive when certain prayers were recited, thus extending their service to the pharaoh even into the next world. Images of daily life were also painted on the walls of the tombs and these images were believed to come alive in the next world. For this reason, the scenes depicted the pharaoh as young and healthy and in pleasant surroundings. These tomb paintings and statues represent the most extensive treasury of ancient Egyptian art. Artists of ancient Egypt were taught, not to be original, but to follow rigid conventions. As a result, the artwork reveals a simple and formal style. For instance, in painting the human figure, various parts of the body are represented from their most characteristic angle. The head is shown from the side, the top half of the torso from the front, the legs from the side, and so on. Methinks there may be a possible answer, or rather two, to your intriguing question, based on: 1. Artistic convention. There were some things one was allowed to paint, some that one was not (think grave robber danger). 2. Location. There may have been nothing but pyramids to see in the lonely arid situations they were constructed not even a date palm or camel. There were no tourist postcards either for making one’s work known to a wider audience. So art was restricted to what one’s sponsor wanted to see … life, maybe, not death, or monuments constructed to house the dead.

That’s the principle. Whether it is feasible in practice is another matter. I personally do not have the resources to investigate with life size templates, and am in any case interested primarily in the theory, especially when one reads that the TS “defies scientific understanding” on account of allegedly peculiar properties (superficiality, 3 D properties etc) when there is in fact nothing about those properties that should occasion surprise if the image is merely a superficial scorch. In fact I don’t put all my theoretical eggs into one basket. The Garlaschelli method, using rubbing of ochre pigment with a live volunteer as initial template may well be a “scorch/template” model when one notes that the linen with the ochre negative is subsequently roasted in an oven. Scorching may occur selectively where the ochre is in contact with linen. Sorry, I don’t understand the second part re velocity.

Once you remove the applied force, the object does not stop moving. It continues at the velocity it had acquired up to removal of the force. To slow down, another force would need to be applied, even a non obvious one like friction. So what is the nature of the force that produces acceleration? If you look at what is happening at the atomic level, it is electrostatic repulsion. The contact is between the electron clouds in the outermost atomic orbitals, so it’s negative negative repulsion. One could model the process using two magnets, bringing two like poles together (N/N or S/S). Just watch the target magnet jump away (“accelerate”) when you bring up the other. If you had a lubricated surface you might even be able to see the velocity of departure maintained for a few seconds. Even now I’m doubtful as to whether I have answered your question. Nobody’s ever asked me it before! PS :On reflection, I’ve realized that electrostatic repulsion cannot be the entire story, because one could make a neutron move by colliding it with another, or simply pushing it (my physics is somewhat rusty) and I have been overlooking one of the most basic laws of physics – conservation of momentum. If one moving object is brought to a halt by contact/collision with another, then the momentum of the first (the product mv) is completely transferred to the second. Kinetic energy (half mv squared) can be dissipated through friction, heat etc. Momentum cannot.

You are certainly keeping me on my toes re the science. Are you sitting comfortably? Yes? Then I shall begin. For most chemical reactions, bar a few exotic ones at high temperature involving free atoms or free radicals, then there’s a simple principle that has to be kept in mind. Before one can have a chemical reaction that requires forming new chemical bonds, existing chemical bonds have to be broken. Think of it as a Lego construction kit, not a new one straight out of the box with separate pieces, but the recycling of one construction – a house say – to make a different one – e.g. A ship. There’s some pulling apart to be done first, which in the case of chemical compounds requires energy. The difference is that making new chemical bonds releases energy, which is not modelled with Lego, but is if you use magnets say (they come together with a crash if you bring unlike poles together). Now then, if the energy needed to break the existing bonds is greater than the energy released when you form the new ones, then the reaction is endothermic, meaning that heat has to be absorbed from the surroundings for the reaction to proceed. That heat might come from a Bunsen burner say. If on the other hand the energy needed to break existing bonds is less than the energy released when new ones are formed, the reaction is exothermic, releasing heat into the environment. The ice/salt is a special case in which the endothermic reaction can proceed without applying external heat from a Bunsen burner, where the energy comes instead from the warm surrounding air resulting in a drop in temperature system itself, ie. The kinetic energy of the atoms, ions and molecules initially at room temperature. As the energy is abstracted, the particles vibrate or move more slowly, the temperature drops, then later returns to room temperature as heat from the surroundings is absorbed. How can that happen spontaneously (just as well it doesn’t happen often or none of us would be here)? It’s on account of entropy. In some systems the increased disorder or randomness of the products is so much greater than the more ordered nature of the reactants that the reaction proceeds without the need for a Bunsen burner, by abstracting energy from the surroundings (fast moving air molecules etc become slow moving). It is entropy change that determines whether or not reactions proceed spontaneously. If the overall entropy change of system AND surroundings is positive (more disorder) then yes, the reaction is spontaneous (but may still need a kick start). If negative the reaction is not spontaneous, and will not respond to a kick start. The ice/salt system is a case in point, because there one has ordered solids (ice and salt crystals initially) whereas one has a highly disordered salt solution at the end – liquids with scattered molecules and ions). Hope that helps. The TS a fake? Possibly, but I’m more inclined to think it was produced initially as some kind of visual metaphor for a dead hero or martyr (Crusader? Knight Templar?), possibly the victim of death in battle or by burning /slow roasting at the stake. Maybe it was intended to portray the idea of how someone taken down from the stake prematurely – dead but not charred – might have left a scorched imprint on both contact sides of an up and over burial shroud. The blood could have been added later to morph that Crusader/Templar(?) image into that of the crucified Christ, not necessarily (in the first instance) to “fake” Christ’s burial shroud, so much as to draw a parallel between two martyrs – one 1st century, the founder of Christianity, the other medieval – a soldier of Christ, or alleged heretic who had fallen foul of the Church, whether for doctrinal or other reasons. I’m sure I don’t need to remind you of the motives of Philip the so called Fair of La Belle France for liquidating the Knights Templar, thus filling his coffers to pursue the 100 Years War against the English monarchy. He had papal support for his hideous pogrom, roasting thousands of Templars after having first divested them of their wealth via torture, though some present day Vatican spokespersons would have us believe otherwise, telling us it was not as simple as that.
