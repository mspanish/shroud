[{"id":"comment-215525","author":"colin_berry","post":"The crucial thing that has to be borne in mind where the medieval forgery narrative is concerned (for the few here willing to give it credence) is this: it didn’t have to be true, as per scripture: it had only to be credible and consistent. So the last two comments re the gap between the heads (visible) and the crown of thorns (invisible) are key pieces of information that have to be fitted into the narrative jigsaw. In fact, they fit very neatly, being complementary in fact. First, the medieval pilgrim arriving footsore at Lirey was told the image was entirely due to imprinting in body fluids, immediately following remval of the body from the cross, i.e. In blood and sweat only. So there was no point in looking for a crown of thorns, or even wounds per se. Everything has to be deduced from the blood and sweat imprints. Why the gap between the heads? Answer: because the crown of thorns was still in place during the imprinting process, preventing contact between linen and the top of head, despite the two being closely apposed. Why the blood on the hair, as if it had been dribbled from on top, rather than coming from the underlying scalp? Answer: because it DID come from on top, not underneath. How? Because while the body was on the cross there was time for blood from the scalp to run to the far ends of the thorns, furthest from the scalp, especially when the head drooped down. Later, when the body was removed from the cross, a few drops of that migratory blood then dripped off the twiggy or thorny ends onto the image left by the hair at the sides. Of the head. There’s arguably the legitimate resort to artistic licence (if one’s an artist). If a forger, rather than an artist, one resorts to narrative licence, the important thing being to have an answer for everything..","date":"2015-12-03","mins":"2:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"id":"comment-215595","author":"colin_berry","post":"I was looking for evidence that there might once have been real thorns, or remnants thereof, in the head region of the TS, and recalled the Poor Clare nuns repair team having been somewhat ambiguous in 1534 re thorns or the blood they produced. Whilst failing to find references to physical thorns per se, I came across this passage, previously overlooked, certainly by me, and possibly Shroudology generally, with specific reference to the image looking as if made from “sweat and blood” (my bolding). In April of 1534, Pope Clement VII sent his envoy, Louis Cardinal Gorrevod, to make an official recognition of the Shroud and have it repaired. Card. Gorrevod knew the Shroud well. For over four decades, he had been intimately associated with the Savoy family, and profoundly devoted to the Shroud. Many times, his hands had held it at expositions and ceremonies. It was he who first suggested that the image was formed by sweat and blood. And it was he who, in 1506, successfully intervened with Julius II to grant Carlo III’s petition for a liturgy and feast of the Shroud.

Why do we have to endure the dismissive “only a painting” fiction when the historical evidence (at least) points in an entirely different direction to IMPRINT from two body fluids (real or more probably contrived), NOT painting?.","date":"2015-12-03","mins":"11:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"id":"comment-215681","author":"colin_berry","post":"Dimitri Kouznetsov?

It is that of the crime detective, seeking out clues, consulting specialists where necessary without becoming beholden to them. A crime detective looking at, say, a Penny Black postage stamp for the first time, and realizing it’s quite old (175 years in fact, unless a more recent forgery) would not immediately assume that its appearance has to be totally different from what a subject of Queen Victoria attached to a letter in 1840, far less that the original must have been painted freehand rather than being mechanically imprinted. Interestingly, the TS image that was reported on in 1534 by the Poor Clare nuns was also chronologically more advanced to almost the same extent relative to what was displayed in Lirey in 1350 approx, namely 184 years. I bet those nuns didn’t think the original might have been a painting originally that had since suffered the ravages of time (and the Pope’s visiting envoy certainly didn’t). None of them needed to consult experts in ancient painted linens to be certain of that. Granted, old painting gradually deteriorate, but they don’t morph or mutate..","date":"2015-12-05","mins":"3:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"id":"comment-215962","author":"colin_berry","post":"“Documented relic routes”?
