Popes Paul II (1464 1471); Sixtus IV (1471 1484); Julius II (1503 1513) and Clement VII (1523 1534) all bear witness that this is the same in which our Lord was wrapped.’ Am I correct in thinking that Shroud enthusiast Benedict XVI never went so far as to use the r word, and his successor certainly did not in his Easter Saturday address, so it’s not entirely clear why there is still a r word alert in the MSM.

But degradation was surely far more extensive, given the difficulty of getting blood stains, real or look alike, into solution, requiring hydrazine and other harsh reagents as I recall, Then there was the atypical porphyrin spectrum, which then occasioned what was largely speculation on their part, i.e. Biblical narrative driven speculation (spectral shifts attributed with trauma induced bilirubin (photo labile) that some might consider would have been photo oxidized away within in no time at all),. One might reasonably ask why they did not attempt a chromatographic separation and identification, e.g. By pyrolysis spectrometry.

Why not? Because he’s not au fait with the problems of dealing with the biological milieu of proteins, lipids etc, of learning the little tricks that are needed to break attachments between your target molecule and the surrounding gunk, and then persuading that molecule, once free, to partition into an organic layer from which it can then be pipetted off and spotted straight onto a TLC plate and run against authentic standards. My first years in research were spent having to acquire precisely these kinds of techniques, and had I encountered Alan Adler at coffee, shaking his head over his “ancient blood” problem, I’d have wasted no time in suggesting a certain fix, one I learned from the bile acid literature, and had successfully applied to bilirubin, and not just free relatively apolar bilirubin but its more polar conjugates (mono and di glucuronides). What one does is exploit the fact that porphyrins and linear tetrapyrroles that originate from haemoglobin all have two propionic acid side chains that make them negatively charged organic anions, or partially anionic, in physiological buffers around about neutral p H. The trick is this. There’s a cationic surfactant called CTAB, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, i.e. Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, which you may have heard of, since it’s used to extract DNA from chloroplasts and other plant material. You add CTAB, and being cationic, it forms a tight association with you anionic porphyrins etc. You then add chloroform, methanol and buffer in the correct proportions to get two immiscible layers, i.e. A standard Folch extraction, and hey presto your CTAB porphyrin associations from the aqueous to the organic layer. Take off that lower organic layer, maybe evaporate some surplus solvent with a puff of nitrogen, then as I say, run on TLC with a solvent of intermediate polarity, maybe with a dash of acetic acid to help split the CTAB porphyrin associations. All you need is a uv lamp to detect the porphyrins as they migrate up the silica gel. You can then take them off with one of those gizmos attached to a vacuum line whose name I have forgotten, and when the removed areas of silica gel have dried you tap out the powder, elute off your purified porphyrins etc for analysis by glc mass spec or whatever. I and Don Ostrow were using this technology in the early 70s to track the fate of bilirubin in the phototherapy of neonatal jaundice. Alan Wotshisname at the Mayo Centre was doing the same thing to track the fate of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. Why on earth did STURP not take advice and tips from people dealing with biological material. Why did they recruit a synthetic organic chemist who, smart though he was, very smart by all accounts, was simply ill equipped to deal with biological gunk?.","date":"2013-11-11","mins":"4:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cementing Over Central Park"},{"id":"comment-50718","author":"colin_berry","post":"So it’s still hunky dory as regards the immunology.

(But neither Adler nor Heller went to Turin with STURP, so had no direct say in sample collection sufficient for needs). Why use the services of a porphyrin specialist who did not accompany the team to Turin, and who made no attempt at physical isolation of the porphyin, relying instead on peaks and troughs in uv/visible spectra, and then attempting to explain away an anomaly by positing the presence of “trauma” bilirubin, betraying a lack of strict scientific objectivity. He was supposed to garner chemical evidence for authenticity – not assume authenticity as soon as the going got difficult.

It’s called hydroxyproline (HP), a breakdown product of collagen and elastin in connective tissue. Given there’s a lot of connective tissue in a leech that may have been extruded along with semi digested blood (depleted in potassium and with an anomalous porphyrin spectrum) by our Brother Hirudo, looking for a handy look alike non clotting substitute for fresh blood, there’s actually quite a few aspects that could be said to fit a ‘wacky’ leech hypothesis. But jump forward to the late 20th century, where an explosives thermochemist recruited to STURP as Chemical Director detects a hydroxyproline peak on his pyrolysis mass spectrum of Shroud “blood” , and what’s his response? Answer: to assume it’s normal to have HP as a major constituent of human blood (where’s the evidence?) and immediately to seize upon it as a handy way of bolstering a flimsy case against the Shroud image being a scorch, claiming that the heat would have driven off HP (despite it being a relatively involatile high melting solid which he probably detected via its fragmentation pattern rather than improbably volatile molecular ion).

First, when looking for someone to service or reconstruct your valuable but falling apart Model T Ford, would your first thought be to employ someone whose main expertise was to do with modern carburettors (or who says he specializes in black cars). Second:if you are invited to referee a paper detailing tests on the Shroud of Turin, do you instantly reject it on the grounds that the data are non quantitative, with no statistical replication, and for the most part spot tests involving colour changes that are possibly subjective, and in any case unrecorded (no video footage)? I probably would not. But I will tell you this. If the author reported tests on sticky tape fibres sampled from a “bloodstain” (that description being provisional and essentially under scrutiny) I would take umbrage at it being described as a coloured serum coated fibre. I’d say that description was begging the question with its reference to “serum”, implying that previous interpretations of the “bloodstains” as serum exudates of blood clots were unproven hypotheses. Indeed, those previous assumptions were to some extent undermined by the curious absence of potassium in the stained areas, and by anomalous atypical haem spectra that had been explained away with assumptions about bilirubin being present, again with no convincing evidence that the light sensitive bilirubin was present. Personally this experienced referee would have sent it back for re writing. (Btw: the Biochemical Journal once sent me a two part paper (I and II) to referee from one of the world’s leading authorities on bilirubin. I went through both with a fine tooth comb, and gradually realized there was so much padding and repetition that the two papers could without much difficulty and no loss of essential content be condensed into one that was just over half the length, and less of a burden on both reader and journal. Later I got a personal letter of appreciation from the journal’s Editor, thanking me for the hard work and the keen eye.

It depends on how the blood was harvested from leech. If it was done in a way that extruded leech tissue and their immunological markers, then the latter would have been initially intact,and any subsequent degradation would be no more or less severe than that of the blood cell markers. So if claims can be made that ABO blood group markers can survive centuries, allowing positive tests for AB etc, then surely the same could be said for leech markers. The problem might be in choosing which leech tissue component to serve as marker, purifying it from a modern leech (hoping there are no species specific problems) and then raising one’s antibody to it. But this is your area of expertise, not mine, being more inclined to think in terms of physical isolation of molecules, as distinct from tactile recognition by your immune sera with their miniaturized tunnel vision search and destroy robots, they of the limited vocabulary (like “found” v “not found”, exterminate, exterminate etc ; ). So, back to my more comfortable and better fitting biochemist’s hat, here’s another suggestion. Given the leech secretes an anticoagulant that prevents ingested blood from clotting, then the fibrinogen of the blood should be intact, and may, just conceivably may, hang around at least for a while (assuming it’s not all strained off to the outside like the watery plasma in which case this idea is a non starter). So one tests for the presence of fibrinogen in Shroud bloodstains. If the pro authenticity ideas of Adler and those before him are true, i.e. That what we see is not whole blood, but serum exudates from bloodclots, then there should be no fibrinogen worth speaking of, although there might be FD Ps, ie. Fibrin degradation products for which there are separate tests. Come to think of it, did Adler et al ever test for FD Ps as another authenticity promoting marker for real blood? I don’t recall any mention of those. Would a synthetic organic chemist/porphyrin specialist have known there are standard test kits available (I used them myself to monitor the health status of rats on a lifespan trial of dietary fibre). But that brings us back to the question of horses for courses… Adler is so often referred to in Shroudology as a “blood expert”.

They travel in a straight line until they strike another ball, then come off at an angle, travel some more in a straight line, collide, come off at another angle. After a relatively few collisions we can safely say that the direction of movement of molecules is random, but we can safely predict they gradually get mixed up with all the other molecules, and “spread out in all directions”. It’s all very well talking about mean free path, but at atmospheric pressure the mean free path before a particular molecule strikes another one is very small, and if the molecule is a minor constituent it will tend to collide with an “air molecule”, i.e. Nitrogen, oxygen etc, rather than its own type, In other words, gaseous diffusion is essentially a non starter where imprinting of an image at a distance is concerned. It’s all very well to say we “don’t know all the factors” but we know the crucial ones to do with the laws of diffusion, and the kinetic molecular theory of gases that underlie those laws. If the truth be told, Ray Rogers was desperately looking for an alternative explanation for the most obvious one – namely thermal imprinting by direct contact. One has only to look at his shoddy arguments for rejecting “scorching” to see how desperate he was. As I’ve said before, he was a gifted experimentalist, but hopeless, indeed downright perverse, as a theoretician.

Tenting would explain why the lateral extremities of the face are poorly imaged, if at all, creating those symmetrical light areas in the pseudo negative (dark in the positive) that you attribute to “banding”. Maybe the “hair” was a separate framing border for the face on the template that was placed too far forward. Certainly it does not look anything like real hair in the Shroud Scope enlargements.

But that is not the case. One can believe in a theory, e.g. Evolutionary theory, because it can be supported by so much evidence as to make alternative explanations virtually impossible. One cannot (or should not) believe in a hypothesis, While a hypothesis is a necessary starting point for scientific investigation, it is not in itself “scientific” inasmuch as anyone can have a hypothesis (“hunch”). What makes Rogers vaporograph hypothesis scarcely scientific is not just that it has virtually no experimental evidence to suppor it. It is hedged about with so many qualifying assumptions as to deter anyone from even attempting to test it. Oh, and let’s not forget Occam’s Razor either. There are rival hypotheses out there however, as you well know, ones that can be more easily elevated to the level of theory. Rogers was too quick to dismiss at least one of those, deploying arguments that frankly were second rate. Why invoke Arrhenius activation energy, when every chemical reaction has an energy hump, no matter how small, reflecting the fact that existing chemical bonds have to be broken before new ones can be created? Why say that the absence of disturbance in cellulose crystallinity precludes thermal modification of carbohydrates, overlooking the fact that there are carbohydrates in linen, notably the PCW hemicelluloses, that can be chemically modifiied at temperatures much lower than those that modify cellulose, or indeed (probably) even disturb its immense physical order and crystallinity? Why say he can find no evidence for heated blood, when many question whether there is any real, or at any rate, intact blood on the Shroud, and in any case employ a highly dubious, some might say quirky test for “heated blood” using hydroxyproline (a test for heated meat, with collagen connective tissue, NOT blood that has virtually no hydroxyproline). Why do you persist in trying to make a hypothesis, and a scarcely tested one at that, into a burning issue of faith? Science is not about faith. It is more about scepticism than faith. Methinks there is perhaps an element of hero worship.

I think those are very good clues that prove that Rogers knew perfectly well the complete chemical structure of a linen fiber, including the primary cell wall. And nevertheless, he NEVER consider this part of the linen fiber as a valid option to explain the coloration we see on the Shroud !!! Of course, that doesn’t prove that Rogers is right about his thin layer of impurities, but that clearly show the erroneous aspect of Fanti and al. Argument that Rogers knew nothing about the primary cell wall and that his ignorance about it caused him to make an error of interpretation regarding the sum of evidences and observations concerning the Shroud.” There you have the problem in a nutshell. Yes, while Rogers never made reference to the PCW, which is a pity, he did as you say mention hemicelluloses and briefly the fact that they were chemically more reactive than cellulose. But here’s the problem. He then began referring to hemicellulose as an “impurity” in linen, one that could be removed with variable efficiency by bleaching etc, contributing to his banding and image intensity. But here’s the curious thing. He left it there, and at that point his impurity theory centred almost exclusively on starch and its degradation products and on those saponins. Once he had brought in his amines and the Maillard theory, all further references to hemicelluloses were dropped. Any chance that he might have regarded the PCW of linen as a reasonably constant feature of linen fibres, with less variability than chance impurities, and identified the PCW as the probable main site of image imprinting was lost when he tried to dismiss heating/scorching as an alternative to his vaporograph theory. He claimed that heating would have disrupted cellulose crystallinity – a highly simplistic view – completely failing to mention that hemicelluloses would constitute a far better marker for pyrolysis at less extreme temperatures. In short, Rogers got carried away with his pet theory re the starch, soap and amines, and failed to give proper consideration to the theory that hemicelluloses intrinsic to linen fibres were the main susceptible component. It’s hard to avoid the suspicion that he simply did not like the idea of scorching of the PCW layer, perhaps because that flagged up the possibility of a medieval origin for the Shroud (via the kind of scenario that Jackson briefly investigated with his bas relief models) and went hook line and sinker for his vapour theory that could be accommodated into the Biblical account, even if requiring no miracles. I hope you won’t mind if I leave it there. These issues are all very interestiing, but I have to give some thought to my own investigations with the splendid Shroud Scope.

Oh yes, the closer the cloth to the skin, the smaller the distance the amines have to travel (by unexplained laminar flow, rather than random walk diffusion) and hence the more intense the imaging of bony prominences etc. But if that were the case, then why are the eyelids so well imaged, despite being set low in bony sockets? Why is the subject’s back not better imaged than the front, given it has the benefit of body weight to give better contact with cloth, reducing distances of separation? Where’s the heat coming from to initiate Maillard reactions between amines and reducing sugars? Let’s not forget that Maillard reactions are more commonly known as “browning” reactions – the ones that give toast a golden brown colour. Ever tried producing toast by not bothering to switch on the toaster, because one is not in a hurry? There is so much that is wrong with the vaporograph hypothesis that one hardly knows where to start… But then, as I said earlier, it is a crankish hypothesis, and one I confidently predict will never reach the status of theory… But it keeps Dan’s hit meter total racking up nicely.

Maillard reactions work best at elevated temperatures, usually above 150 degrees C. That’s not to say they won’t take place at typical environmental temperatures, but the Arrhenius energy of activation (“energy hump”) means there is a negligible rate of reaction. How can a slow reaction rate give even a gradual image development if one of the reactants is a gaseous (volatile amine) able to diffuse and leak away long before it can be fixed by reaction with reducing sugars? And if it’s a slow reaction, the ammonia or amine would diffuse, preventing one from getting a sharp image. There is a single word that sums up the “vaporograph” theory, but Dan will put me back on watch if I use it here.

The latter can reproduce without needing a liquid medium, like bread mould, through creating a mat aka trophic mycelium. In fact anyone who has stored cloth in a garage will know that mould (“mildew”) can attack fabric without it becoming obviously wet. What’s more, there are fungi that secrete cellulase enzymes that can break down cellulose – so folk are right to wonder how the Shroud can have survived so long, given that it spent much of its pre radiocarbon existence ; ) under unknown but probably less than ideal storage conditions. In fact, I am presently planning some experiments to explore the interface between thermal and chemical imprinting. A recent paper has shown that writing in invisible ink using lemon juice does not depend on the presence of cellulose or other carbohydrates, including presumably the more reactive hemicelluloses – as shown by a brown coloration on heating in glass only containers. But that does not preclude additional chemical modification, e,g, dehydration, cross linking and caramelisation occurring too. I shall be looking to see whether linen can be thermally imprinted at lower temperatures if plant derived substances, acidic ones especially – are included, perhaps giving a softer more Shroud like image. Any resulting image may be dependent on chemicals that are non intrinsic to linen as well as to heat (with faint echoes of Rogers&Yannick and their “impurities” – but relying on direct physical contact rather than gaseous diffusion). It may be the latter, ie non intrinsic chemicals, combined with occasional high ambient temperatures, that explain the slow formation of leaf prints etc. And maybe the Shroud too. We shall see.

Quantum biology: Do weird physics effects abound in nature? By Jason Palmer and Alex Mansfield BBC News and BBC Radio Science Unit http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science environment 21150047 The following passage focuses on photosynthesis, where the strongest case can be made, but the article later mentions Dave’s robins too. “There are definitely three areas that have turned out to be manifestly quantum,” Dr Turin told the BBC. “These three things… have dispelled the idea that quantum mechanics had nothing to say about biology.” Deep within plants’ energy harvesting machinery lie distinctly quantum tricks The most established of the three is photosynthesis – the staggeringly efficient process by which plants and some bacteria build the molecules they need, using energy from sunlight. It seems to use what is called “superposition” – being seemingly in more than one place at one time. Watch the process closely enough and it appears there are little packets of energy simultaneously “trying” all of the possible paths to get where they need to go, and then settling on the most efficient. “Biology seems to have been able to use these subtle effects in a warm, wet environment and still maintain the [superposition]. How it does that we don’t understand,” Richard Cogdell of the University of Glasgow told the BBC. However, before rushing to invoke quantum weirdness to explain anything and everything (junking established scientific laws re the natural world) it’s as well to remember that quantum effects only make themselves apparent on the sub macroscopic level of existence. Individual living cells are microscopic, but still macroscopic where quantum physics are concerned. The same applies to the subcellular organelles like chloroplasts and mitochondria which have electron transport chains for ATP synthesis that operate “better” than might be expected. But once you take on board the amazing degree of organization of proteins and electron carriers at the molecular level of membrane phospholipid bilayers and their embedded proteins, then you have in all probability a smooth seamless continuum that leads from the macroscopic world of conventional physics to the microscopic, indeed sub atomic world of conventional physics. That’s where our mental concepts of space and time begin to break down, or at any rate become hopelessly compromised. Personally speaking,I think there’s a lot of conventional science still waiting and needing to be applied to the Shroud image, and meanwhile too much mantra intoning based on mere impressions. I mentioned a prime example here the other day – the idea that the TS image and associated chemical changes are confined to a superficial layer on linen fibres, 200 600nm thick.

I use “contact scorch” to indicate there is no imaging except where template is in direct physical atom to atom contact with hot metal, ceramic, whatever. If there’s the slightest air gap, then there’s essentially no scorching, though a slight yellowing might just be possible from hot convected gases. There are those who maintain that the TS image includes parts of the subject that could not have been in contact with linen. They have yet to convince this sceptic. All the important parts, i.e. Raised relief, could or would be accessible, especially if linen were draped over template (whether bas relief or fully 3 D) and then manually and forcibly impressed in and around important contours. The places most likely to get ‘missed’ are precisely those that appear as pale poorly or non imaged areas on the TS (eye sockets, around the crossed hands, the gaps or even curvature between fingers etc.). I use bas relief to imply something like the head on a coin with a little raised relief but much less in relative terms than the real live or dead subject, or a fully 3 D representation of the latter (statue, bust etc). The wiki definition is OK seems OK for starters: “Bas relief is a type of sculpture that has less depth to the faces and figures than they actually have, when measured proportionately (to scale). This technique retains the natural contours of the figures, and allows the work to be viewed from many angles without distortion of the figures themselves.” I believe the face (at least) of the TS image was imprinted from a bas relief (as incidentally did Prof Luigi Garlaschelli). The sharpish break in image continuity between cheek and hair on both sides is the give away, suggesting there to have been a groove or trough in the template such that no imaging was possible in that gap. The idea that the break is just a banding effect in the linen, that the ‘missing’ image is retrievable with the right ‘enhancement’ with computer software etc, simply does not stand up to close critical scrutiny.

Notwithstanding the charge from the site’s host of inconsistency, I reserve the right to return to a site that I’ve otherwise abandoned if the alternative is to leave character attacks unanswered. In this instance it’s the absurd attempt to turn the promotion or defence of an idea into some kind of character slur or defect which I simply can’t allow to go unanswered. Here’s a comment I’ve just placed on my own site that sets out my current position re the likely provenance of the TS after many months of reading and research: It is unhelpful and unconstructive to judge the TS as a choice between authentic or non authentic. It’s like deciding whether a stuffed swan one is about to see in a natural history museum is black or white – it could be either. The rational and constructive way of viewing it is to ask whether the TS is a contact or non contact scorch. If it’s a contact scorch, then it’s fairly certain the image is man made, using a heated template to imprint the image (which will of course be a negative, explaining what might otherwise seem peculiar at least from an artistic standpoint, being much more photogenic centuries later when Secondo Pia era photography and light/dark reversal became practicable). If it’s a non contact scorch, then all options are open, pro authenticity ones included, radiocarbon dating notwithstanding. But while there are groups who promote their own preferred non contact scenarios (laser beams, corona discharges, sugar seeking putrefaction vapours, earthquake releases of radioactive emissions etc) few if any of them are willing to generalize and say it’s a non contact process that is being proposed, and that the image characteristics are consistent with, and can be modelled in the laboratory as a non contact process with a qualitatively different outcome from the simple, uncomplicated man made contact one I favour. In short, we see systematic evasion of the scientific essentials, the latter based on model testing and evaluation. Not a pretty sight. Some folk’s thinking might be described as pre Renaissance. Indeed, there may well be a hankering for pre Renaissance certainties, when everyone, the unwashed, uneducated classes especially, knew their place and did not dare to question their social and intellectual superiors..","date":"2014-09-21","mins":"3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/21/lest-the-wrath-of-god-descend-upon-them-like-a-ton-of-bricks/","cat":"humor","title":"Lest the wrath of God descend upon them like a ton of bricks"},{"id":"comment-21908","author":"colin_berry","post":"I’ll take your word for it, not being privy to what’s in other people’s email inboxes.

But what mechanism precisely? And what is the nature of the image in that different mechanism? Why not admit it – you don’t have one, because none of those airy fairy mechanisms that involve something other than direct scorching ever specify the chemical nature of the image, far less the process by which such an image came to be formed without a credible source of radiation, or an imaging system (converging lens etc My theory may be wrong, but it at least specifies the source of energy (thermal), the method of heat transfer (conduction), the chemical nature of the scorch (semi pyrolysed cellulose and/or other carbohydrates). What’s more, it totally rules out any kind of imprinting at a distance. Heat conduction requires that two bodies be directly in contact, i.e. With a zero air gap. Sorry, Gabriel, but you have failed to make any point or objection that advances the SCIENTIFIC debate. If you want to be scientific, then try to falsify the conduction model.

I could have a reasonable stab at doing so, certainly, although the comments section on someone else’s blog is hardly the ideal place for setting out some very detailed and technical arguments, especially when there are so many who see scepticism as an attack on faith (my primary concern is with misapplications of so called science, and is nothing to do with faith). The scientist does not approach the Shroud at the level of minute detail. A more structured approach is called for. The first is to establish the nature of the image – a scorch etc and then the likely source of energy that produced the image, and then how the energy and linen interacted in a fairly orderly fashion to produce so interesting an end result. I am now 99.9% convinced that the image IS a scorch, that it was not produced by radiation, but by intimate contact with a heated 3 D object. The energy entered the linen by close contact under a degree of applied pressure, i.e.by conduction, necessitating a zero air gap. Bit by bit I can account for features of the Shroud, notably the presence of front and rear images with no side image, the crease marks at the extremities of the head, the basis of 3 D encoding (being as much about angle of contact between cloth and hot metal and resultant force of impression as anything to do with physical relief).

It’s not just length that is at issue, but general build: frontal v dorsal They could be two entirely different people, and invoking “cadaveric rigidity following crucifixion” is what is politely known as “begging the question” (some other descriptions spring to mind). Bent model It is totally misleading to suggest that the differences are down to “foreshortening” due to bent posture etc since that is to borrow the language of optics and photography in the absence of a shred of evidence that either of those were involved in image formation. If as I believe the image was created by forcing cloth against a heated 3 D object, e.g. A bronze statue or bas relief, then all kinds of distortions become possible in the imprinted image, depending on what parts made contact and what parts did not. The underside of the chin, if imaged, would create the impression of an over long neck (which some have commented upon) The imaging of the foot on the dorsal side could end at the heel, or the tips of the toes (running along the sole of the foot), or even longer if the cloth then ran back along the top of the foot. We urgently need a re analysis of the entire body imprint to see whether the assumptions of “photography” onto a cloth – loosely draped or stretched flat – are totally, totally wrong and misleading, and as I said a minute ago, BEGGING THE QUESTION. I personally believe the image will be found to fit a model in which a lifesize 3 D replica of a human being, e.g a single bronze statue or cobbled together bas reliefs, has been imaged by impressing cloth against the heated replica. The latter can add or subtract to length and width dimensions, depending on whether all contours are followed, including ones that do not add to “real” vertical body height, e.g that underside of the chin mentioned earlier, or which subtract, due to “tenting” of the cloth between prominences (easily detectable by unexpected gaps in the image)..

Nothing had to be managed, Metals are without exception good conductors of heat, especially copper, due to delocalised clouds of electrons. A typical bronze is 90% copper. In any case, what gives you the idea that the image is equal quality all over? Not so – the hands are much better defined than the feet, for example? All metals, except ‘maybe’ very highly refined types will show ‘hot spots’ when heated. To me this FACT alone counts out any type of bas relief method, not to mention the basically impossible notion that someone could place uniform ‘pressure’ throughout the whole surface of the cloth within a finite amount of time to create the image we see. Again, you are suggesting that the image is perfect in all respects, with no “problematical” areas. Strange then that I was reading just the other day someone commenting on an unexpected dark area on one of the hands, which might be one of your hot spots. I would find that more credible than the explanation offered, namely that an obscured thumb had been x rayed – along with all the bones in the hands and fingers… Ah, the wacky world of the Shroud, where anything and everything is possible, where simple branding technology, possible at humble blacksmith level, is dismissed as too mundane for words, “unscientific” even… Shroudology should carry a health warning to mainstream scientists… We would need an expert in metallurgy, with unmatched skill in sculpturing, surpassing even the likes Michelangelo and with an unpresedented knowledge in physics and a dexterity only matched by a computer controlled machine to “pull off” such an amazingly realistic image. Maybe you are not au fait with the method for casting bronzes. Nobody had to sculpt metal. They would carve their model in wood, then uses a sand/clay mould in a lost wax method that involved pouring in molten copper/tin alloy. Bronze is exceptionally good for casting – expanding slightly when it solidifies to give a good impression of every detail on the carved timber template. .

But I’ll admit you never cease to intrigue us with your persistent research. Well the image is certainly unconventional, given it is a light/dark reversed negative iand hardly attractive until viewed centuries later as a photpgraphic positive. But that’s the major point in favour of the branding theory – that it DOES create a negative image off the 3 D template., and is entirely feasible with medieval technology. Indeed, the sand casts used to create bronzes may well have inspired the idea to use them to facilitate the branding onto linen – making the outcome more practicable and predictable than if carried out manually akin to brass rubbing. No burned fingers if you use a sand bed, and thump down from on top, say with a wooden log, to get a good impression!

I had previously thought this subtlety was difficult to explain in a simple contact scorch scenario, i.e. By pressing a hot metal template vertically into linen that is spread over a layer of sand or similar. I now realize that was the wrong model, because it did not permit close enough imprinting, if relying purely on contact between substrate and linen under applied pressure (too much “tenting”). Something more “tactile ” was needed, and if using a hot metal template, a means of detecting heat (and minimizing over scorching) by finger tips alone. I now believe I know how it was done, to produce a very faint image, with pale yellow fibres, as per these welcome pictures, mainly but not exclusively on the more superficial crowns. Basically what it required was a reversal of the geometry I had been using previously, now laying a hot metal template down onto a hard surface. Placing COTTON fabric on top initially, then covering with a double layer of damp cloth, and pressing/moulding around the contours of the template with one’s finger tips. As soon as there is excessive heat detected, one has two options. One is to fold the damp cloth to get a double thickness, and go on moulding to take more heat out of the template until satisfied it will not excessively scorch more expensive linen (though fortunately linen is actually harder to scorch than cotton). When the hot template has passed the finger tip test one takes away the cotton, replaces with linen and repeats the procedure, moulding fabric to contours with finger tips, monitoring temperature. One can lift a corner if need be to check on progress. Finally, one draws back the linen, and if the result is like the ones I obtained this morning ones sees a VERY FAINT image of one’s template with no reverse side penetration or scorching. It’s in fact difficult to see the image except at a distance (ring any bells?) and under a x10 hand lens there is no obvious localisation of discoloration to the crown threads as might be expected from scorching off an over hot template. There are subtleties, which I shan’t try to explain now, but ones that might well impact on 3 D imaging, giving an odd quality.

As regards manpower and secrecy, the Shroud is believed is said by authenticists to have been in the protection of the Templars prior to its first display in the mid 1350s. They were, as we know, a highly secretive order so would have had little difficulty in keeping their possession of the relic known only to themselves. By the same token they surely had the ability to fabricate it too, and keep that a secret (and money and manpower would have been no problem, at least prior to their liquidation by Philip the (Un) Fair). So Templar involvement could be said to cut both ways where the debate between authenticity and medieval fabrication is concerned. As for the nuts and bolts, I frankly don’t know enough about medieval bronzes to know if they were solid or hollow, but am inclined to think they were the first. That would make them an enormous weight. My own brass crucifix from the French street market is less than 15 cm from head to foot, but weighs a whopping 300grams! If I place it against a wall, the only points of contact are the hands and, guess what – the buttocks? If one tried to secure by the feet there would be an unsightly gap, and the bolts would have to be angled if doubling as crucifixion nails. Frankly I doubt whether 4 crucifixion nails, through hands and feet, could have safely doubled as securing bolts to a wall, even indoors. My crucifix has a long threaded bolt into the middle of the back, but a better, neater solution for a full size effigy would surely be the buttocks, especially as they are flush against the wall, making for an invisible attachment if viewed from the side. I’m fairly certain that the torso at least would have been modelled on a statue rather than bas relief (and have always considered the head to have a bas relief mask like appearance what with that token vertical hair, the sharp cut off at both sides of face, being unconvinced by the bleaching/banding arguments). It’s the feet that are the give away. No bas relief would have made the feet so problematical from an imprinting point of view. There is scarcely any imprinting of frontal feet, at least none recognizable as feet with toes, and it’s not difficult to see why if imprinting from a statue with the feet almost at right angles to the legs and torso.

I would go further and state (though Hugh is free to differ) that is the result of linen – at the instant of imaging – failing to conform (i.e. To drape around) every contour, due to a tenting effect, i.e. A short cutting of taut linen from one extremity/prominence to another, leaving a hollow or air gap across which no imaging is possible by contact and conduction (but with the possibility of weak imaging by convection currents of heated air, steam and other gases). The radiationista would say there can be imaging across air gaps, conforming in their narrow vision to an inverse square law (but with a strange cut off at 4cm!). The facts speak otherwise – when one looks closely at a number of areas of the Shroud image (e.g. The region around crossed hands especially). Any weak imaging that may occur across air gaps where there are tented regions between extremities, is confined to very small distances, and is almost certainly due to convected current of hot air and pyrolysis gases. Look if you will in vain for any references by the radiationista to the phenomenon of heat transfer/temperature increase arising from convection. All they see is their supernatural radiation, and they then try to dismiss what they see as the exclusive alternative – namely direct physical contact between subject and linen with atom to atom conduction with simplistic, nay crass arguments, with no recognition whatsoever of close heat encounters of the third kind – i.e. Convection – moving currents of heated gas and vapour that can scorch at a distance like the reverse side of the linen, where gas meets a solid underlay, admittedly conjectural, creating a second interface for pyrolysis via contact/conduction..","date":"2013-04-12","mins":"5:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-30576","author":"colin_berry","post":"I’ve seen two fields from Shroud 2.0 App now – the one here, and another on Mario’s site of the forearm.

What they mean in reality is what we would once have heard as “Tough. I hold the negatives”.

Earlier observations, sadly my own, mid 2012, re the distribution of blood between herringbone ribs and furrows (based on lower magnification Shroud Scope images) were clearly in error, based as they were on the deceptiveness of images that fail to show the weave pattern in sufficiently high resolution and magnification. Having made that admission, one still wonders why those vital Evans’ images are still ‘copyright protected’, real or apparent. While gold dust to researchers, it’s hard to see any obvious commercial value. BS to his credit did tell an intermediary (Thibault Heimburger) back in 2012 that he could supply me with a CD archive of the Evans images for a token charge.

Here is what the principal copyright practitioner’s text, Copinger & Skone James, has to say: In terms of what is original for the purpose of determining whether copyright subsists in a photograph, the requirement of originality is low and may be satisfied by little more than the opportunistic pointing of the camera and the pressing of the shutter button.

If you’d asked me that a few months ago, I’d have said that linen is expensive, and if the technique did not forsee the possibility of baked in creases when hot template and linen were pressed together with contact area out of sight, our artisan would have hoped the crease would be mistaken as having come later (and many now do – shroudologists included!).

The need to make clear it was a scorch may have been especially important if using a life sized crucifix as template, to defend against the charge of blasphemy should the local bishop suspect that the man represented was not Jacques de Molay(?) as claimed, despite the image being a less than photogenic hard to recognize with absolute certainty negative.

For this kind of investigation, however, namely the darkening around creases, then the shadows created by Durante’s lighting scheme render the reliability of any observations about the actual cloth unsound. I would take seriously any suggestion that what I have been describing as creases, especially those that are intrinsic to the image (“baked in”) and contemporaneous with the image imprinting processes, were mere shadow.artefacts. Yes, we know such artefacts exist, and are abundant near the ends pf the Shroud, presumably where excessively centralized lighting becomes more oblique. But it’s not difficult to see they are shadows on account of a lack of fine structure, especially when one twiddles with contrast. (Ignore the warnings here about my placing “unscientific” reliance on colour changes – I certainly don’t, and never did in a series of over 12 postings on Shroud Scope in 2012 (totally ignored on this site btw) where the contrast control was used merely to assist discrimination within an image between one discrete feature and another). To illustrate my point I have just kept the same elevated contrast on the chin crease where it crosses hair, and turned down the brightness. Ignore any colour differences. The key thing to note is the way that the denser side of the twin track, largely homogeneous in the default Shroud Scope setting now breaks up into spotty fine structure, while other recognizable structures, such as bloodstains in hair, serving as an internal control, do not, retaining their characteristic morphology. So the chin “crease” cannot possibly be shadow. It is most likely to be body image that has been efficiently imprinted onto a bulging crease in the fabric.

What it said basically is that the dismissal of the radiocarbon dating on statistical grounds (lack of homogeneity etc) is a cheap shot, given that the three labs were fobbed off with a specimen from a corner that was then subdivided. If you want a valid statistical analysis that tells you something about the age of the entire Shroud, then you have to set up your sampling frame accordingly, and ensure that it is randomised. What you don’t do is give a tiny specimen, and then treat the rudimentary stats that accompanied the results as if they were reporting the age of the entire Shroud. They were simply reporting the age of the specimen provided. The stats are there simply to summarise lab to lab variation in testing the three contiguous specimens,where any systematic trends in results is nothing to do with the accuracy or precision of dating the entire Shroud, but to do with the fact that non identical clean up procedures were employed by the three labs. All is not lost. While fobbed off with a single corner, the data constitute a ranging shot exercise that gives at least some of us a reasonable degree of confidence in AMS technology. Probably any one of the three labs is competent now to date the entire Shroud, given randomised sampling. What’s not needed on this persistent talk about “fiascos” from this site, or dark insinuations about collusion between labs to produce a false answer, or attempts to dismiss radiocarbon dating completely on the grounds that it cannot be reliably applied to fabric (Why not? Because the ranging shot result was not the one expected? RIP scientific objectivity). Folk here would be pushing the Shroud custodians to approve Phase 2 radiocarbon dating, say with 5 or 6 random samples from non image areas of the dorsal Shroud. If anyone then wants to dismiss those results on non scientific grounds (i.e. The imaging may have altered the ratio of C14 to C12?!) then extend the sampling to image bearing zones, but I shall not be the one to propose that, not wishing to be accused of defacing a holy relic. If they want to persist with objections based on hypothesised contaminants (unscientific if the contaminants are not specified) then take a sample of linen, solubilize the cellulose, reprecipitate, check it analyses as 100% glucose after hydrolysis, then re date.

Yes, it’s hard to be enamoured of the STURP intervention, given its terms of reference seemed to be concerned mainly with what the image is not (painted on pigment) as distinct from what it is. For the latter we have to be content with two useful scraps of information, namely that the reflectance spectrum of image bearing areas resembles that of a “scorch” i.e. Pyrolysed carbohydrate, aka dehydrated carbohydrate and that the colour is bleached with the powerful reducing agent diimide. That essentially is it, and on that somewhat flimsy foundation, or as some might say, despite it, Rogers built his starch impurity hypothesis which this commentator regards as a giant red herring distracting from the concept of the image as a simple thermal scorch, replaced with the largely untested idea of a Maillard reaction product requiring both reducing sugars and exogenous amines of some description. (The latter handily suggesting the presence of a decomposing corpse and putrefaction amines – never mind the time and/or temperature scales). If as I hope the new Pope gives a go ahead at some point a new round of investigation, hopefully well targeted, then there is a fairly simple straightforward way of characterizing and quantifying carbohydrate pyrolysis. It involves borrowing analytical methodology from dietary fibre research (a major preoccupation in my own career). If anyone’s interested in the details, I’d be only too happy to oblige. With a little luck, it should tell us straightaway whether the image is on a starch impurity layer, or on that of non starch polysaccharides, NSP (either cellulose, or non cellulosic NSP, e.g. Xylans and other hemicelluloses etc associated primarily but not exclusively with the highly superficial PCW (primary cell wall) of flax fibres..","date":"2013-10-11","mins":"12:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/10/responding-directly-to-colin-berry/","cat":"science","title":"Responding Directly to Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-47010","author":"colin_berry","post":"Here’s an abstract for starters that summarises the methodology quite well.

It might be interesting to compare patterns before and after diiimide reduction to see if one can get more direct evidence on the specific carbohydrates that are modified.

It’s that same lack of objectivity that is used to to give a veneer of pseudo scientific respectability, one that brings science into disrepute. Example? Raymond Rogers was recruited to STURP to seek evidence for or against the Shroud being 1st century AD. So what on earth was he thinking when he posited the presence of a starch impurity coating, citing Pliny as his authority, and then egging the pudding by claiming that the image was on that impurity coating, not the linen carbohydrates per se? It is hard to imagine a less objective approach to estimating the age of the Shroud chemically (pre radiochemically) or on which to base a claim for the image pigment being chemically modified starch. The objective scientist is of course permitted to dream up the idea of an extrinsic starch impurity coating. But he then puts that idea into a mental compartment when he enters the lab. What he does when he arrives at the bench is first systematically check for the presence of starch over the entire Shroud, both image and non image regions, then demonstrate there is less measurable starch in image regions, then perhaps demonstrate that the image can be easily washed or digested out along with any unreacted starch, leaving intrinsic image free flax carbohydrates. Then and only then might Pliny get a mention. Then and only then might the cautious objective scientist speculate that the Shroud was 2000 years old, given the possibility that sizing starch was a marker for 2000 year old technology. Instead we have a edifice of non objective so called science, almost certainly influenced initially by non objective theology, one that distracted from the real task of determining the true location and chemical nature of the Shroud image. There is a Danish scientist I used to collaborate with by the name of Dr.Hans Englyst. He and his co worker John Cummings developed methods for planrt cell wall analysis that while developed for dietary fibre analysis could in principle be used to determine which components of flax linen fibres survive the image imprinting intact, potentially allowing the target molecules to be deduced by a process of elimination. I can give more details if anyone is interested. I can even produce a group photograph that has me, John Cummings and Hans Englyst at the same scientific congress, approx mid 1980s. Sir Richard Doll is in the same picture too (smoking/lung cancer link). We have scarcely begun to investigate the Shroud using well tried and tested methodology – physical, chemical and biological. Of course, none of it might have been necessary if the Shroud custodians had provided samples from the main body of the cloth (the dorsal side would have sufficed initially) instead of fobbing off THREE labs no less with a snip from one corner. Maybe they too (the samplers, the in house so called science advisers) were inhibited by the (non objective) thought that what was being sampled was a “treasure” – a preconception that was supposed to be under critical scrutiny, not assumed.

I think the type of approach you suggested is important to help characterize the details of (specific) carbohydrate involvement. My preference would be to start without any preconceptions as to what might or might not be there, and simply compare the sugars peaks on one’s glc trace with that of flax and modern linen v older specimens. One expects to see glucose peaks for cellulose and NC Ps, and pentosan peaks that correspond to the arabinoxylans and other hemicellulose sugars, and of course those uronic acids from pectins. It’s my hunch (purely that) one will see depletion of hemicelluloses in image bearing zones, but retention of most of the cellulose, on the assumption that the image is on the superficial PCW hemicelluloses. Anything unusual or unexpected can be investigated using the fragmentation pattern from glc mass spec’. Specifically looking for saponins from those “Tales of Mystery and Imagination” would come rather low down my list of priorities. As indicated earlier, the real fun is to see what happens to those sugar profiles if one takes linen that has had its surface discolored by varying degrees of carbohydrate dehydration, aka pyrolysis or caramelisation or just plain “scorching”.

Most of the literature where plant material is concerned is to do with cellulose, and with high temperature treatment (with a view to making semi synthetic fuel oils). So it’s back to first principles in trying to guess what kind of products one might be dealing with where discoloration of linen is concerned, especially if as seems likely it is hemicelluloses that are the more susceptible to chemical change. If one were to take as one’s model a fairly mainstream, uncontroversial model, it would be the pyrolysis of xylans to furfural (an aldehyde). First the xylan polymer de polymerises, releasing free xylose sugar. That then loses three molecules of water to form furfural. C5 H10 O5 → C5 H4 O2 + 3 H2 O But there’s a problem. Pure furfural is colourless. However, it does yellow quickly on exposure to air (not surprising, given that aldehydes are reactive, and tend to polymerise etc). So when they speak of carbohydrate dehydration it may in fact be dehydration plus simultaneous aerial oxidation. That would then account for the ability to bleach the product with diimide – by reversing the secondary oxidation – but presumably leaving the initial dehydration step(s) intact. So what are the products of furfural oxidation that are yellow? From a quick literature search: “A problem associated with the use of furfural, however, is its tendency to oxidize in the presence of atmospheric oxygen to form oxidation products such as furoic acid or formyl acrylic acid or formic acid which further, upon heating, forms furfural acidic polymers.” http://www.google.com/patents/US5332842 So where does that leave us? It’s possible that diimide reduction will return us to furfural, or a related aldehyde, and given its volatility, it should not be difficult to detect on glc. But if the yellow product is a polymer, formed with one or more oxidation steps, then it’s possible that while it could be bleached, it would still remain polymeric, and fail to reveal itself on glc.

It would start with his use of a pigment paste to imprint features from a real subject onto linen (being careful to avoid going “too far round the sides, i.e. Being content with a shallow bas relief effect. Now if you go to his papers you will see there is then a baking stage in an oven (intended partially or primarily to mimic age related yellowing of the linen), but there is also mention of pigment subsequently flaking off, leaving a residual image, the nature of which is unspecified. Hugh Farey here has for some time been hypothesizing that the Shroud image is a ‘shadow’ or faint signature of something that was originally more prominent, prior to a flaking off (and I have said the same previously re partially or extensively flaked off bloodstains). Is anyone thinking what I am thinking? The oven treatment did more than just artificially age the linen. It produced a more pronounced and highly localized chemical reaction between the pigment and the underlying linen that might be described as thermochemical imprinting via temperature assisted chemical ‘scorching’. The phenomenon is not too dissimilar to the one I described in my very first posting on the TS, referred to as thermo stencilling: http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2011/12/turin shroud could it have been.html There I used charcoal as the pigment, and radiant heat at a distance to get it hot (rather than baking in an air oven, or direct contact say with a hot iron). But the end result is/was (or could have been) the same – localised scorching of the linen in contact with pigment. This model has similarities and differences with the direct scorching model that I later adopted using heated metal or ceramic templates like a “cattle brand” instead of a real subject. But then ideas evolve (sometimes getting side tracked!) and I have always been impressed with Garlaschelli’s end result, differing only with his interpretation of how the end result was achieved, a closer scrutiny of that oven baking step perhaps being required. There’s more one could say about the chemistry that produces the scorch, which probably involves chemical dehydration reactions that are a sub group of “scorching”, but that can be explored another time. The role of iron and its compounds is worth studying, especially in the light of Mc Crone’s (prematurely?) discredited results and interpretation thereof, recalling that Luigi used ochre – a form of iron oxide – as his imprinting pigment. Might it have had acidic impurities, producing thermochemical dehydration of linen carbohydrates, allowing scorching at lower temperatures than required for direct hot template contact? Thanks for the reminder re Luigi G.

In the first one has sialo and other glycoproteins that are cell surface associated and critical for cell cell recognition, as well as binding water at the cell surface. Sooner of later those cells die and the detritus has to be digested by endogenous lysosomal enzymes, using those glycosidase enzymes.Otherwise the organism would get clogged up with its own cast offs. It’s an entirely different situation in plant cells walls. Cellulose provides the fibres for mechanical strength, especially in the secondary cell wall, and hemicelluloses provide a ground substance or cement. The difference is that plants do not recycle their dead and dying cell wall components. After lignification they continue to provide support after death. Finally they drop off, and the only type of organism that can then recycle the carbon are the saprophytic fungi with their invasive feeding hyphae. But fibrous strands, or even hemicelluloses within those strands, are a tough substrate, which is why it can take years or decades even for dead wood and other vegetation finally to disappear. So the enzymes for hemicellulose digestion are not indigenous to the plants that made them, but in an entirely different organism, so are unlikely to show the kind of exquiste selectivity that one might desire if seeking to use, say, purified fungal glycosidases to effect an efficient step by step dismantling of hemicelluloses (and let’s not forget that they they have chains that can have hundreds of sugar residues strung together.).

One need hardly say that the faintness is almost certainly due partly to age. Some might think it improbable that the present faint image would have been such a big draw in medieval times.By the same token, anyone attempting to reproduce all the subtle tones and fuzziness of the present image would be having to simulate centuries at least of ageing – a tall order. It’s unrealistic, indeed unfair, to expect anyone, Garlaschelli included, to produce a perfect facsimile of the Shroud image. For my part, I have always ignored the challenge if expressed in those terms. It’s the claim that science has been totally unable to reproduce essential Shroud characteristics that irritates me, especially when negative character, superficiality or 3 D properties are raised. Superficiality has never been determined rigorously (the 200nm figure being a a guesstimate, and probably achievable anyway with a light imprinting with conventional materials and/or sources of energy), and 3 D properties can be demonstrated in any image in which the highest density corresponds with highest relief (a charcoal sketch sufficing). Science does not have access to a time machine to see exactly how the image was produced, and how it has subsequently aged. So let’s not set the bar impossibly high, certainly not using subjective aesthetic criteria. It should be sufficient for science to produce a reasonable approximation of the Shroud image to show there are no insuperable obstacles to producing a highly superficial negative image with 3 D properties. Oh, and one final thing. If you take a negative image of a face, and perform a light/dark reversal together with some 3 D enhancement, you will often find the end result has a serene ghostly quality as per TS. That is fully explainable in terms of terms of inversion of light v dark space, harshness becoming soft focus etc. How many folk here have experimented in this area, say with Image J? I have (and reported on it).

You see, I was confronted with the quoted passage from his book on my very first visit to this site, and can recall vividly my very first reaction. “Why was that STURP investigator talking about linen as if it were pure cellulose”? Why was he assuming that scorching would affect something as physically and chemically stable as cellulose? Was he not aware that there are other polymeric polysaccharides in linen that are far more chemically reactive that need to be considered first as the prime target of contact scorching? There are the pectins, and, more importantly, the hemicelluloses, especially as the latter are a major constituent of the primary cell wall, the most superficial exposed part of the linen fibre. How did I know these things? Answer – because I spent 12 years researching dietary fibre as Head of Nutrition and Toxicology at a cereal research institute – i.e. Plant cell wall polymers. I also researched resistant starch, collaborating with specialists using differential scanning calorimetry to characterize it as retrograded short chain amylose, and with that background knew instantly that Rogers was focused on entirely the wrong constituent of linen fibres. It did not take long to learn that the first components of linen to dehydrate and pyrolyse, starting at about 230 degrees, are the hemicelluloses. The cellulose does not pyrolyse until much higher temperatures are reached (see paper by Wang et al). What worries me right now is that I’ve been placed on standby, in anticipation of TH’s 3rd pdf, and here he is still talking up Rogers and his work from long, long ago, seemingly indifferent or ignorant of the profound gaps in Rogers’ knowledge of the plant fibres and their detailed chemical make up, treating them as I say as if they had been pure cellulose. I shall not be waiting with bated breath to see that 3rd pdf, given TH’s failure to acquaint himself with everything I have been saying for months, indeed years. It’s customary, indeed courteous, to find what one’s opponents are thinking and writing before subjecting them to critiques, especially when the latter offer no facility for commenting and correcting the record. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Dan Porter should not be allowing hugely under informed TH to subject me to trial by unanswerable pdf on this site, AND highlight those same pdfs in his sidebar. Why has he not relayed some of the criticism voiced on my own site, given that he’s covered so much of the other content? How many people here know that I have found major faults with TH’s experimental methodology (pdf 1, totally unsuitable template) and been totally unable to reproduce the major “finding” of his pdf2 (“impossible to scorch superficially at the thread level”). TH should stick to his medicine. He is not trained in research methods. It takes a minimum of 6 years at a UK university to reach doctorate level – which is one year longer than a bachelor’s degree in medicine. Does he seriously imagine that his medical degree equips him to do scientific research as well? He hasn’t the first clue about designing OBJECTIVE research protocols.

However there is a later letter from an impeccable authority (St.Francis de Sales) written to his mother from Annecy in 1614, where it’s quite clear that he viewed the image as being one formed of sweat and blood (no supernatural agency being hinted at). “Whilst waiting to see you, my very dear Mother, my soul greets yours with a thousand greetings. May God fill your whole soul with the life and death of His Son Our Lord! At about this time, a year ago, I was in Turin, and, while pointing out the Holy Shroud among such a great crowd of people, a few drops of sweat fell from my face on to this Holy Shroud itself. Whereupon, our heart made this wish: May it please You, Saviour of my life, to mingle my unworthy sweat with Yours, and let my blood, my life, my affections merge with the merits of Your sacred sweat! My very dear Mother, the Prince Cardinal was somewhat annoyed that my sweat dripped onto the Holy Shroud of my Saviour; but it came to my heart to tell him that Our Lord was not so delicate, and that He only shed His sweat and His blood for them to be mingled with ours, in order to give us the price of eternal life. And so, may our sighs be joined with His, so that they may ascend in an odour of sweetness before the Eternal Father. But what am I going to recall? I saw that when my brothers were ill in their childhood, my mother would make them sleep in a shirt of my father’s, saying that the sweat of fathers was salutary for children. Oh, may our heart sleep, on this holy day, in the Shroud of our divine Father, wrapped in His sweat and in His blood; and there may it be, as if at the very death of this divine Saviour, buried in the sepulchre, with a constant resolution to remain always dead to itself until it rises again to eternal glory. We are buried, says the Apostle, with Jesus Christ in death here below, so that we may no more live according to the old life, but according to the new. Amen. Francis, Bishop of Geneva The 4th of May 1614 The mere fact that the image is what today we call a”negative” was one that the medievals would quickly have seen as a bodily imprint (NOT a painting).

Uv excimer laser beam scorches? Radioactive emissions from earthquakes? Corona discharges of ionized air molecules? Nope.

How difficult is it to understand that what I consider to represent a simulated sweat imprint left by a man’s body, with reversal of normal tones (“negative” character), 3 D properties, non directional character, spectral and chemical properties of chemically dehydrated linen carbohydrates etc, one moreover that was immediately branded as an attempt to deceive, can by no stretch of the imagination to be seen as just another painting? In any case, it could hardly have had time to degrade to a faint ghostly image over the few years between its first display at Lirey and the subsequent ban that lasted decades. From the word go, the TS was seen as EITHER the real burial shroud of Jesus OR a very clever forgery, which the Troyes bishop, first of the non authenticists, unwisely declared to have been cunningly painted.

Maybe you weren’t aware that it was replaced in 1963 by The Even Newer Chronology. Taking the New Chronology as its inspiration, it proposed that world history did not in fact start until the mid 19th century (1851 to be precise). How, why you may ask? Well, it’s not easy to summarize in a few sentences, and the clock is ticking where this site is concerned. Suffice it so say that 1851 was the year of the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park London, conceived as a show piece for what then was state of the art engineering. One of its lesser known exhibits was a primitive hologram generator. A man behind a curtain wound a handle, and history (well, virtual history) was displayed as a faint image on a screen (an intricately woven linen, or so I’m led to believe). Thus was generated the so called Middle Ages, and when you wound some more you got the Roman Empire and before that the glories of Ancient Greece, but sad to say the further back you went the fainter the images. It was all fake history, needless to say, since the earliest history is the Dark Ages, before which there was the Even Darker Ages, but you know those Victorians – they liked to put on a show and were very inventive, except when building railway bridges over the Tay estuary which tended to collapse under the weight of a fully loaded passenger train. Btw, those images are/were exceedingly superficial, a mere 200nm thick some say, though rumour has it there was a little man with a paint pot who used to brush furiously onto the roll of linen as it wound past. According to that theory, the painted linen then went through a high speeed instant ageing machine before passing in front of the assembled spectators. The latter daren’t blink, however, given the risk that the aged paint would flake off before they had a chance to perceive the image details..","date":"2015-12-27","mins":"10:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-217291","author":"colin_berry","post":"I’m surprised and somewhat disappointed, daveb, that you an engineer managed to spot only one of my two deliberate errors.

Alternatively, Geoffroi de Charny, himself having been captured and held to ransom in Brittany (see wiki) may have intended it for his own fully comp insurance policy. But I reckon it took a lot of expensive trial and error R&D to get the Shroud looking so authentic, and that probably needed asubstantial input of funds from King John himself, probably coinciding with the founding of the Order of the Star one year after his 1350 coronation.

It’s hardly surprising that if something is at tiny concentrations, virtually indistinguishable from background levels, then there will be a poor signal to noise ratio. That should not prevent one from concluding that there is little or nor potassium in the bloodstain if potassium levels are scarcely greater than background levels in unstained linen, and thus hard to distinguish from background with certainty. A poor signal to noise ratio might prevent one from determining if its level is 1% greater than background, as distinct from 2%, but that’s largely irrelevant if the expected ballpark concentrations of potassium are not detected. There’s a serious problem in identifying a red stain as real whole blood, ancient or otherwise, if there’s no strong signal for potassium (or sodium) relative to background.

It was not enough to ask: “Do these stains contain the known markers for blood, modern or ancient?” If the possibility was considered that the TS was a forgery, the hypothesis should have been “Are these stains real blood, or what remains after centuries, or might they be simulated blood that may have contained real blood, or a fraction thereof, that has had one or more additives or treatments to keep it looking more blood like?”. It’s the near impossibility of answering the second of those with 100% confidence that places a question mark over whether any testing on TS blood can ever be truly and/or fully scientific. That may sound defeatist, but it’s not. The imperative is to think like a medieval forger, to ask what he might have employed as a blood substitute, and then go looking for markers, not just for blood, but for the suspected additives.

Please note the narrative that accompanied the “bag theory” (which is not a theory, btw, but a recitation of the biblical account – see my reply to dave B) was not pro authenticity. It was an attempt to read the minds of medieval forgers, setting out to provide a bigger and better version of the Veil of Veronica – that also being a sweat/blood imprint in the first instance, albeit with miraculous add ons that kept generations of artists occupied adding more and more improbable details (crown of thorns etc). Incidentally, I’m surprised that Charles Freeman should set so much store by the Tempesta engraving (1613). Sure it shows a crown of thorns, but it also shows intact shoulders, despite displaying the distinctive pattern of 1532 burn holes. It also shows separated feet, it shows hands crossed at wrists, it shows a bulky loin cloth.

They can’t, for the reason I told you earlier, namely that the sepia body image does not show wounds. The latter can only be inferred from the presence of blood at a particular site. Whenever one reads accounts that refer to wounds one has to examine the text closely. One invariably finds that it is blood that is being referred to, not wounds. Your quoted passage from de Beatis is a case in point: A more explicit description comes from the Travel Journal of Antonio de Beatis, who visited Chambéry as secretary to Cardinal Louis of Aragon in October 1517. The Shroud was displayed for the visitors. ‘The images’, de Beatis tells us, ‘were impressed and shaded in the most precious blood of Jesus Christ and show most distinctly the marks of the scourging, of the cords about the hands, of the crown on the head, of the wounds to the hands and feet and especially of the wound in the side, as well as various drops of blood spilled outside the image, all in a manner that would strike terror and reverence into the Turks, let alone Christians’. The same is true of the passage you quote from the Clare nuns 20 years later who repaired the Shroud after the 1532 fire. If you read it carefully, you will see, once again, that there is no certainty that they were describing actual thorns or their images. Instead it seems more than probable they were letting their imaginations run riot. You conclude by saying “Little of this vivid imagery survives today”. That because it was never there in the first place, having been inferred imaging of wounds in the above accounts, based on the blood trails – NOT wounds, which I repeat are NOT imaged on the Shroud. Remember: we’re constantly told that blood was imprinted before body image. How can there be imaging of wounds, i.e. Lacerated or punctured skin per se if the blood from those wounds was imprinted first?.","date":"2014-11-28","mins":"8:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-173392","author":"colin_berry","post":"There are two entirely different narratives getting mixed up here. The first is the pro authenticity narrative which is the one we are accustomed to see being discussed in detail here. In that, Joseph’s purchase of fine linen is seen as the final burial shroud, with imprints of clotted/reliquified (?) blood arriving first, and the body image second, with no agreed mechanism as to how the latter was generated, whether instantly in flash (a byproduct of resurrection) or slowly from vacated post resurrection mortal remains. The second is the medieval forgery narrative. It had to explain how both blood AND body image came to be imprinted on a length of linen (since the first and subsequent cohorts of pilgrims were bound to ask). The narrative for that could have invoked (a) a flash of miraculous light at the instant of resurrection, though I doubt it, or (b) it could have proposed some slow post mortem process (but that would surely have led to degradation of blood stains). What this blogger has been seeking is a third option (c) that is neither of the two above, but which fits with my reading of the 4 gospels, which may not be the same as others here. In the medieval forgery narrative, option (c) the fine linen purchased by Joseph of Arimathea was used as a makeshift body bag, into which Jesus was placed immediately after taking down from the cross, taking whatever steps were needed to deal with rigor mortis if present. There would have been one or more ties for ease of handling, as in the modern day photograph above. In this forgery model one then has the scenario that explains both the body image – imprinted as sweat – and the blood simultaneously from an unwashed body. In this model there is no need to imagine that all the blood had first dried and/or clotted, requiring one to speculate as to how it reliquified or re moisted. The imprint of sweat and blood formed immediately the body was placed in the linen. Yes, there are question marks as to how a sharp imprint and image could be formed, but the same questions were no doubt asked of the Veil of Veronica image on a makeshift face cloth that was used to “wipe” sweat and blood from the face of the still living Jesus. It’s anyone’s guess as to the answers given, but one can be fairly certain that the same answer was given for both Veil and Joseph’s linen: there was an initial imprint that then miraculously transformed into a fully fledged image – maybe immediately, or maybe over a passage of time, which could have been hours, days, decades even. Anyway, that’s the bare bones of what I’m proposing, based on an IMAGINED imaging onto a body bag that was never intended as the final burial shroud, and which medieval forgers could then set about simulating, i.e. Modelling, using simulated sweat and real or simulated blood. That simulating could be IDEALIZED please note. The scorch model is still very much in business folks, given that a faint thermal imprint off a heated template could have been passed off as a yellowed, age degraded sweat imprint, the tone that we now refer to as the superficial negative image with no directionality and 3 D properties. Look – no paint pigments (not for the body image at any rate – blood or “blood” is another matter).

T. IV. Paris, Louis Roulland, 1703, p. 261. Free in Google Books p. 28. « L’autre Suaire qui porte ausi une empreinte du corps de Jesus Christ est celui qu’on appelle le saint Suaire de Besançon.

It was a common belief that the mark of Turin Shroud was made with blood. I was content to quote just the second part of those two from André Baillet, in which he presciently anticipated my 21st century hunch by some 300 years. Clever, these French… Why then is David M whom incidentally I thank for unearthing that fascinating opinion from 300+ years ago , so keen to dissociate himself from the idea of there having been two shrouds, with the TS being what I inelegantly term a makeshift body bag (sorry, alternative descriptions invited)? Why describe it as “interesting” unless he sees some merit in the suggestion? It seems eminently sensible to me that there should have been one piece of linen (Joseph of Arimathea’s) for transporting Jesus from crucifixion site to tomb, and a separate subsequent one for the final burial shroud, once the body had been made more presentable by washing free of blood, applying sweet smelling ointments etc..","date":"2014-11-27","mins":"11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-27455","author":"colin_berry","post":"One doesn’t need to be infallible, daveb, not if you are the new incumbent of the Holy See.

It’s the selection process I criticized, and will continue to do so. Why was an explosives thermochemist put in charge of chemical studies when he had little or no acquaintance with flax or linen fibres – demonstrated with a blind spot for the primary cell wall, and immediately invoking an impurity layer that was a figment of his imagination and then proceeding to build his house of chemical cards? When he finds a strong signal for hydroxyproline in Shroud blood,what does he do (instead of consulting with haematologists)? He immediately assumed it to be a constituent of normal blood (which it is not) and before you know what is attempting to deploy that marker for collagen and connective tissue (possibly/probably non human) as an argument against contact scorching. When radiocarbon dating gives the wrong answer, what does he do, apart from spouting nonsense about invisible weaving via end to end splicing, crude attempts to disguise forgery etc – with distinct symptoms of personal pique if not paranoia on full display? He attempts to substitute some quirky home spun chemistry, having the world believe that the decay of a chemical marker – volatile, chemically unstable vanillin is as good if not better than physics based radiochemical decay. And all of that self serving twaddle is accepted for publication in, guess what, his own Thermochimica Acta, a journal he helped to establish, sitting on its editorial board year after year deciding which thermochemical papers to accept and reject, with Shroudies then crowing for ever after that Rogers’ finding were “peer reviewed”. A thermochemist goes out of his way to reject a thermochemical explanation for the Shroud image – i.e. Contact scorching – which is obviously anti authenticity, in agreement with the radiocarbon dating but then uses a thermochemical journal to publish his quirky and often misinterpreted results. You couldn’t make it up – but so much of what came from STURP was just that – made up special pleading, deployed in the subsequent defence of “mystery”, of entirely fictional model building. Nothing distinguishes the real from the faux science than the model building. There are many who think “I too can have hunches” and imagine that science is a game that anyone can play. What they forget is the self discipline, the self doubt, the self criticism that goes into the patient construction of models that are based on a modicum of existing hard fact, especially fact that fits poorly with existing models. They know nothing about the models that are strangled at birth, through recognition that they are not testable in principle, at least on a realistic timescale. I could give a similarly unflattering account about some otherprima donnas on the seemingly xenophobic STURP (or did it simply have a blind spot for the rest of the world’s scientists, even its own Nobel laureates, many of whom were equally interested in the Shroud, and in many cases MUCH BETTER QUALIFIED in several instances, e.g. Haematology, pyrolytic chemistry, botanical microstructure to make an input ). Instead we got STURP characterized by self indulgence,swaggering over confidence, preening vanity. It was also a byword for non transparency. But I shan’t press the issue further than I have done already, because some of us are more concerned with trying to undo the damage that so many of STURP’s scientists–turned late career pseudo scientists did to science. That’s why I am now keen and determined to involve my nearest centre of scientific excellence – the UK’s Royal Society. Heirs to Newton, Faraday etc. I want its considered opinion on what has been placed into the public domain as if solid, reliable science, which I consider to be anything but on so many crucial issues, I want its collective brain power and scientific flair and know how to be placed at the service of ‘Shroudology” proposing perhaps overlooked or state of the art new approaches for resolving key questions like “What arrived first – blood or image?”.

The first, the more familiar of the two, is yellowing that occurs over lengthy time periods, years, decades, centuries. That involves the slow oxidation of the aromatic lignin components to form yellow compounds, and light can and does play a role in that process. But it is also possible to get a photo bleaching of yellowed lignin using intense short term exposure to light (bleaching, note, not yellowing). How can that be, one might ask? Surely that contradicts the role of light in yellowing? The answer, as is so often the case in chemistry, is that an entirely different kind of chemistry is operating. In this instance, it is bleaching that is mediated by a special form of molecular oxygen that is produced when light interacts with compounds in the presence of photosensitizers. Regardless of whether the reaction is self sensitized, or the result of a foreign compound being present, the result is the production of so called singlet oxygen (the subject of this blogger’s very first published paper on the self sensitized photo oxidation of bilirubin). Singlet oxygen has the ability to add across C=C double bonds, and given that it is those double bonds, usually in conjugation, i.e. – C = C – C = C – that confer yellow colour, the result of converting double bonds back to single bonds, as in vicinal diols etc results invariably in bleaching. So intense flashes of light, far from producing a yellow colour and an image, are likely to do just the opposite, namely to bleach any pre existing yellow colour. So much for those miraculous flashes of light – and that’s without addressing the physics, that says a lens or collimator or other specialized hardware would needed to form a recognizable image, in the absence of which one has John Jackson’s alternative hardware free physics, what I now term ‘fizics’. If Pope Francis really is a chemist, maybe he could find a minute or two to check out what I’ve written for any silly errors. But I’m fairly confident that the above account, all standard textbook stuff, would stand up in a court of law were I ever to have the misfortune be summoned as an expert witness on what light exposure can or cannot do to linen… My first words would have to be “Well that depends, yer Honour, on what you mean by light exposure”..","date":"2013-03-16","mins":"11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/16/the-making-of-a-meme-pope-francis-scientist-not-or/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Making of a Meme:  Pope Francis, Scientist.

If we’re to all now don our amateur historian hats, might I suggest we start with a strangely neglected period in TS history, i.e. The immediate run up to its first undisputed appearance in European history in 1357 approx in the tiny hamlet of Lirey. Here’s some essential reading on the fleeting existence of the Ordre de l’Etoile (The Order of the Star), founded in 1351 by John II of France (“John the Good”, or John the Saintly some might think, if one reads the reasons why he voluntarily returned to English captivity through disgust at the ‘dishonorable’ escape of his son from similar captivity.). Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order of the Star %28 France%29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John II of France The wiki entry says that John’s knightly and arguably semi religious order had been “inspired” by none other than Geoffroi de Charny, the Lord of Lirey no less. Indeed Charny is elsewhere described as a founder member of the Order, which understandably faded away in the aftermath of the disastrous (for the French) Battle of Poitiers in 1356 at which de Charny was killed, hardly surprising given he was ‘honoured’, read targeted, as carrier of the Oriflamme, and John was captured and exiled to England. For a brief period, two of the most powerful men in France were members of the most powerful club in France – one that they themselves had founded. Might the TS have been gifted to them, for ceremonial use? Or might they have commissioned it themselves, money and top level patronage opening doors aplenty. Were there links between the Order and those with the technical know how needed to conjure what could be claimed to be the long lost Linen of Joseph of Arimathea? Might the TS have been in the Star’s Paris HQ in the early 1350s, being returned de Charny’s widow on his death, maybe in lieu of hard cash to help her cope. That might explain why the TS was not on public display until immediately after her husband’s death.

So far, I have had only a few days of experience with flour paste as imprinting medium and nitric acid vapour as developing agent.

Already I know of a better alternative to wheat flour, and there are a number of different geometries, ‘frottage’ techniques etc that can be adopted at the imprinting stage, different pre treatments of the linen etc etc. Oh, and I don’t agree that de Charny’s widow would have left her newly deceased husband’s coat of arms off the Lirey badge. How respectful is that? Indeed, the badge may have been commissioned partly as a memorial to a celebrated and valiant knight, one of the top men in the land. *It’s not “Charnay” (sic) btw, which is one spelling of the alleged Templar uncle aka de Charney, who was roasted at the stake alongside Jacques de Molay in 1314. ).","date":"2015-04-24","mins":"4:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"id":"comment-197398","author":"colin_berry","post":"You are still being somewhat unfair, daveb, in suggesting that I’ve little to show for three years research.

My new model is not ‘naturalistic’. It does not see any role for natural emanations from a dead body leaving an image on cloth. The defects of Rogers’ model, at least as initially set out, have been discussed at length on this site: gas or vapour molecules do not move in straight lines, unless released through a slit into a perfect vacuum, i.e. ‘collimated’. So how can expect to image across air gaps. Or is it a contact only model? Naturally draped cloths do not make good contact with the 3 D relief of a human body, without some applied ‘frottage’ as in the Garlaschelli model, and my own. There was no frottage in that 1st century tomb. Sure, there is a vapour in my new model, but it’s the gaseous phase of a ferocious chemical agent (70% HNO3) that gradually convert over hours a pale or colorless organic based imprint (whether carbohydrate, protein etc) into a yellow or brown image, not dissimilar at first sight to the sepia image on the Shroud. The new images are not dissimilar either from those produced by contact with hot metal (the “thermal imprinting model). But there’s a huge advantage over that previous model: being a two step process – wet imprinting with a harmless foods substance (flour paste etc), followed by an aggressive development in the laboratory (or garage!), one can imprint part or ALL of a living person (or cadaver).

One smears maybe, but with harmless things like flour paste. They are the imprinting agent, as distinct from developing agent. No harsh chemicals come into contact with the skin. Nitric acid vapour is then used to develop the imprint transferred to linen by those harmless agents. Nobody had to dive into vats of developing agent in the early days of photography. The same principle applies. Capture a latent image that may be barely visible. Then develop it chemically until it reaches the desired level of visibility. Think of it as tactile ‘chemography’, an alchemical forerunner of photography (?) As I said earlier, the method can be scaled up to work with the entire body. No new equipment requirements or modification of basic technique are introduced, except for larger sheets of linen, more imprinting medium, larger vessels for suspending the linen over nitric acid to get a few hours exposure to the vapour. Based on a single pilot experiment, I suspect that the exposure time can abe considerably reduced using an alternative to flour paste that works faster and as a bonus also sequesters the vapour before it can do appreciable damage to the non image areas. The final colour – yellow or brown – can probably be manipulated by altering the ratio of carbohydrate to protein in the imprinting medium. More carbohydrate means more oxidation, more browning. More protein means more nitration, more yellowing. The nitric acid model would appear to be a versatile system, but there’s much development work still needing to be done.

Some of us have had a training in chemistry and biomedical science, and see absolutely no reason for thinking the TS image is non reproducible. The notion that a superficial 200nm coloration precludes a conventional mechanism is total nonsense, given that 200nm is the approximate thickness of the PCW with its complement of highly exposed and vulnerable hemicelluloses. Scientists are not trying to disprove the existence of supernatural phenomena. What they object to are pseudo scientists who rush to invoke the supernatural, claiming that this or that technique provides “hints” of the kind of unscientific ‘theophysics’ that may be operating. Harnessing laser beams is especially deplorable, given that the Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation is an entirely man made effect created by containment and precise geometry, with no evidence that it occurs anywhere else in the universe.

When light is transmitted from behind, the image is not visible at all.” http://www.jesusisreal.org/shroudofturin/ Therefore, using the powers of reason, it is ob Therefore, using the powers of reason, it is obvious the image was formed by a supernatural process and fortunately (for those who believe in the authenticity of the Shroud) is not reproducible. ” Sorry, Angel. How much experience do you have Y of images that are only visible when you stand well back, or which are not visible with back illumination? I suspect that your experience of those features is the same as everyone else’s here, which apart from the Shroud of Turin is zilch, zero, nothing. So what gives you or anyone else for that matter the right to go insisting that an unfamiliar effect is supernatural, simply because you are at a loss to explain something new and unfamiliar. In fact you have no right to do that at all. What’s more, the scientific approach is to treat every such unfamiliar phenomenon as something that can be investigated by applying known principles of physics, chemistry and biology. Invoking a supernatural cause is simply a way of stating that you have no understanding of the scientific temperament or modus operandi. What is so deplorable is that our friends at ENEA say in the one breath that the approx 200nm deep image is too small to be formed by conventional science, yet in the same breath state that 200nm is also the thickness of the outermost layer of a linen fibre, namely the primary cell wall. Had they followed that up – the botany that is – they would have learned that the PCW is especially rich in chemically reactive hemicellulose explaining why image colour is concentrated in so thin a layer, explaining no doubt its no you see it, now you don’t properties. They also acknowledge that image fibres are mechanically weaker than non image fibres. How come, if all the chemical change is restricted to the PCW? Answer: it’s almost certainly not. There are hemicelluloses in the core SCW as well, and they were probably compromised too in the image making process, except that is not so easily visible, due to the preponderance of unaffected cellulose. It is deplorable that those ENEA folk attempt to lecture us all on what is or is not possible with conventional science, displaying as they do an abysmal lack of knowledge – or even interest – in the fundamental botany and chemistry that has to be addressed if one’s to probe and understand the nature of the TS body image. Why do have to repeat myself over and over again on this site re the crucial role that hemicelluloses play, contrary to the prevailing assumption that linen fibres are essentially pure crystalline cellulose. That’s approximately true for cotton, but NOT for linen. Is it not just a little discourteous to constantly recycle the same old faux arguments at a researcher – without bothering to read at least some of his postings, which in my case have focused relentlessly on hemicelluloses for well over 3 years? This biomedical researcher worked in the area of cereal dietary fibre for some 12 years. Hemicelluloses are one of the most biologically active of the cell wall carbohydrates, being easily fermentable in the lower bowel.

I wish I’d known about Shroud Scope 6 months ago, instead of 16 hours! There is at least one glitch that needs pointing out. The overlay that delineates major bloodstains on the face in close up does not correspond with the bloodstains, notably that reversed 3 aka epsilon on the forehead (at least on my Firefox browser). But it’s the profound question mark that these HD close up images places over so much received wisdom that interests this science bod with far too much time on his hands. Like why are the so called bloodstains virtually indistinguishable from other image areas, inasmuch as the imprint is largely confined to the crowns of the weave, with virtually none in the intervening furrows. OK, so blood is viscous, but one would have expected at least some to penetrate between parallel threads? Or is it only singed or otherwise denatured blood that is imaged, which would contradict Rogers’ claim (which I have always regarded as highly dubious) namely that the bloodstains show no evidence of heat damage (based on a curious, some might say idiosyncratic measure of hydroxyproline context). (The meat industry uses HP content as a test for heated meat, i.e. Muscle tissue, which is rich in HP mainly on account of its connective content, but there is virtually no HP in blood, the little that is present being a degradation product of collagen and other connective tissue proteins). I now find myself wondering about the key claim that the blood was transferred to the fabric before the image. How reliable is the evidence on which that view is founded? I see from an oft cited 2004 Rogers paper that he bases his blood first view on a simple spot test in which he applied proteolytic enzymes to the blood stains, and found that removing the stain revealed/uncovered/exposed no image under the stain. That does not strike me as conclusive evidence for anything, certainly not for a major claim re the bloodstains. I shall obviously have to dig deeper, but if in the meantime anyone knows of better evidence than a single spot test with protein digesting enzyme, then I’d be grateful for a link.

There is a pronounced series of parallel ribs on the top side of my linen, but unlike the Shroud, my blood has not confined itself to the crowns of those ribs (why should it?) and is instead distributed fairly evenly between ribs and intervening furrows – exactly as one might expect a liquid to do. Everyone is agreed (I think) that the Shroud image is mainly on the most superficial part of the linen, i.e. The crowns, with different explanations being offered (I say it is due to scorching by direct contact; Rogers explained it in terms of impurities that concentrate on the highest points through capillarity and evaporation, where they then react with his volatile body decomposition amines). Why should blood concentrate on the crowns of ribs, given it has particulate red blood cells, and given its tendency to clot quite quickly? Are you thinking what I am thinking? Probably not, but then you are not a sceptical scientist. In fact you said earlier you are glad you were not a scientist (while prepared it seems to believe SOME scientists who say those spots are blood, even though in some cases their comments were hedged around with caveats).

That interpretation is supported by the passage you quote from Heller. It refers only to calcium, not calcium carbonate, making no claims specifically for calcium carbonate. I shall check my copy later for the full passage. In short, no one need doubt there is calcium in the TS fibres, and/or adventitious particles of aragonite rock etc, but the “calcium carbonate” that you and others assume to be present would appear to be nothing more than a casual uninformed guess, with no attempt to place on a scientific footing.

You beat me to it. Here’s the relevant passage from the Rogers & Schwalbe paper verbatim: “Morris et al reported relatively uniform concentrations of calcium and strontium in all of their spectra. The large quantities of calcium (200+/ 1.0 mg per cm squared were tentatively interpreted as dust accumulations, probably natural calcium carbonate on the Shroud. Riggi similarly observed substantial quantities of calcium compounds in the samples that he vacuumed from the back side of the cloth. Although Riggi’s observation tends to support Morris’s interpretation, subsequent microscopic examination of the tapes showed little or no calcium debris from the Shroud image surface. Heller and Adler have since postulated that the calcium and strontium were absorbed into the linen during the retting process. They draw support for this hypothesis from both an experimental demonstration of the ion exchange process and the observed presence and the observed presence of iron and calcium in several other antique linen samples.” Would you agree that there is simply no experimental basis or justification for our historian friend to bang on endlessly about “gesso” when there’s no evidence, at least that I’m aware of, or which he has been repeatedly challenged and failed to produce, namely that there is calcium carbonate specifically on the TS, excluding occaional flecks of wind blown or otherwise acquired dust?

One expects to see lateral distortion in a 2 D image that has been obtained from a fully 3 D person, or effigy thereof, when in fact one sees little of that effect in the TS. But that latter observation has to be qualified. Everyone is agreed that there is no imaging of the sides. In one of the the models you quote, namely radiation, there has to be a quite extraordinary assumpttion made to account for the absence of sides, namely orthogonal projection of emitted radiation as if controlled by the Earth’s gravitational field (one suspects Einstein would have had words to say about that!). But these considerations apply less to an image that has been produced by medieval technology to simulate what a contact imprint might look like centuries later, formed by transfer of sweat and blood. The image did NOT have to match that which would really be obtained by imprinting. It had only to match what could be claimed to have been made by natural, unassisted imprinting. While I hesitate to mention it, there is an imprinting mechanism that captures as little or as much of frontal v (partial) lateral topography as is desired. It’s one which uses a fine powder (white flour) as imprinting medium which can be applied to the highest, flattest parts of the anatomy that one wishes to imprint, being careful to leave it off ‘sides’ especially. There’s a second safeguard to avoid or minimise lateral distortion, namely that in the simulation scenario with white flour/wet linen, there is manual moulding of cloth to flour coated subject, allowing further control to be exercised over what is or is not imprinted. Thus far, I have imprinted off my hand (easy, satisfactory imprint, negative, 3 D enhancible) and my face (total disaster, as expected). Luigi Garlaschelli also recognized the problem, ruling out contact imprinting off the face in his paste or powder frottage model. He concluded that a bas relief was used for the face. I’d certainly concur with him re the face, and a bas relief would account for the arguably mask like appearance with severe cut off at both sides, and maybe account too for the somewhat peculiar look where head and neck joins the torso..","date":"2015-12-15","mins":"4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216508","author":"colin_berry","post":"There’s that haunting line from J.R.R.Tolkien at the start of ‘Lord of the Rings’: “And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.

Why would artisans choose to imprint onto linen with hot metal template? A rationale was found by supposing that the image was not that of the crucified Jesus, but of the roasted at the stake Jacques de Molay, or his lieutenant, Geoffroi de Charney, claimed by some to have been uncle to Geoffroi de Charny of Lirey, first recorded owner of the TS.The Templar narrative served as adjunct to the science – but was not crucial in the sense that disproving the Templar link would not necessarily have invalidated the imprinting technology. It was the “Veronica” like imprint on the Machy mould that was the signal to abandon the Templar link, and to see the TS as an attempt to extend the principle of imprinting a face onto fabric with sweat and blood, as per Veronica legend, to imprinting of an entire double body image by the same body fluid principle, a pretext for which was found with Joseph of Arimathea’s linen being used to receive the newly crucified body from the cross, prior to washing etc. That then led to a search for imprinting technologies that used the real human body as template instead of hot bas relief metal, finally settling on use of white flour as the imprinting medium, and again producing negative 3 D enhancible images (so still scientific), with the fit to biblical narrative still not crucial. In short, it’s easy to misrepresent a scientific train of thought as being fanciful, when at each stage there is a concrete imprinting model being proposed. But even if it were fanciful nothing I do has become a fixation, far less an obsession. I rarely mention the current white flour model on this site, knowing that anti authenticity ideas do not do the business. There’s plenty of pro authenticity ideas being flagged up on a daily basis (some obsessional, sad to say) that lack for an actual mechanism for imprinting a negative image, and even when one is hinted at, e.g. Di Lazzaro’s uv laser pulses, there is no negative, 3 D enhancible image, only a faint brown discoloration of linen.

It should be self evident to rational folk that there can be no forensic analysis of the TS body image. Yes, I too have seen and previously commented on the video ( David Rolfe’s “Silent Witness”, with that oh so earnest “autopsy” performed by Robert Bucklin MD). Few seem to appreciate that Bucklin had in fact been a long declared proponent of Shroud authenticity, going back to the early 60s, albeit with impeccable credentials as a pathologist, yet there he was performing his “autopsy” on the grainy Enrie B/W photograph of the TS (nope, not the actual TS even) spread out on a mortuary slab (seriously!). Sadly Bucklin’s comedic autopsy written up as if a real one in stilted language, was taken as serious state of the art pathology by several STURP members before travelling to Turin, with its influence apparent in the 1981 Summary no less, and visible in the medically qualified John Heller’s book. “Forensically speaking”.

The weighed samples for radiocarbon dating were image free. What if the image was NOT entirely chemically modified , i.e. Additive free, linen fibres. Suppose it still had remnants of an applied substance (nope, not gesso or paint, but something more subtle and interesting, like say, er, white flour, er, toasted). Then the weight of the entire TS linen, had it been measured directly, might turn out to be more than 1kg. Even if a mere half or even quartrer kilo greater, that would be a significant new data point that would need to be flagged up to anyone seeking an explanation for the body image.

What kind of wound imaging would you expect? Being firmly in the medieval provenance camp, I would not expect the TS body image to have any wound imaging whatsoever, as indeed is the case, or so I maintain after detailed scrutiny of Shroud Scope images. Why not? Because the TS body image was designed to simulate a sweat imprint left on Joseph of Arimathea’s linen by a newly deceased body transferred from cross to linen without washing. An ‘executive decision’ was made by the team leader of the medieval modellers to show imprinted intact skin and hair only, with no attempt to represent the open wounds in hands, feet, side scalp and scourge marks (far too tricky and dispensible anyyway). Those sites would be flagged up as wound sites ENTIRELY by addition of blood. Most observers would give credence to “blood equals wounds” provided the blood was in all the biblically correct location. So the onus is in fact on pro authenticity pathologists to justify their use of the term “wounds” in their autopsy reports. But they can’t. There is no imaging of wounds. There is merely blood stains or imprints, which they were not entitled to interpret as open wounds, i,.e.torn or punctured flesh unless or until authenticity has been established or, more pointedly, that forgery has been rigorously excluded. In short, this sceptic is not the person to whom the question “what kind of wound imaging would you expect” should be addressed, since I did not expect any, and don’t see it anyway. Instead, the pathologists should be asked “what kind of wound imaging did you find, and if you didn’t see any, then how can you refer so confidently to “wounds” when all you have to look at are blood stains that could in principle, certainly post radiocarbon dating, disputed or otherwise, have been applied by a medieval artisan to make the observer believe he was looking at wounds that in reality were not there?”.","date":"2015-12-17","mins":"6:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216763","author":"colin_berry","post":"First postscript: https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/archive 1 face cropped.png?w=385&h=443 There are at least a dozen bloodstains on the frontal face alone, David G that are entirely attributable to a (missing) crown of thorns.

It was decided, mainly for practical reasons, to keep the basal background body image as simple and straightforward as possible, the only detail being in the face (bas relief?) and the crossed hands. Elsewhere everything else was blurred and ill defined. But there was a theoretical rationale that could be deployed in the event of a medieval sceptic or know all claiming the body image was too simple. It would be pointed out that it was created from sweat, and sweat is a mobile and runny substance, even oily sweat, so could not be expected to produce a sharp imprint that incorporated fine details of body anatomy or wound damage. Having made that decision to keep the body image simple, there was a price to be paid in the imprinting of the blood. There had to be a compensating overkill – one that would dispel any foolish notion that the figure represented was merely a stylized artwork. Quite the contrary, there had to be a gut clenching paramedical immediacy and impact that in modern day reporting would have resulted in a sensibility preserving pixellated photograph on the newspaper front page. No, for our secretive goal oriented medieval imprinters, there was to be no prissy pussyfooting around in the manner in which blood was applied to the image. It had to be done in a manner that looked like the man had REALLY been flogged to within an inch of his life (even if the Bible gives no indication of that) crowned with deep penetrating thorns, nailed, crucified and finally lanced. There were to be no half meaures. Indeed, nothing short of 100% reality imprinting would do, given the imperatives of what they had set out to achieve, the motives for which one can only guess at (though King John the Good’s Order of the Star offers fertile ground for speculation, especially if he had had a premonition that he would be captured and held to ransom at the Battle of Poitiers,1356. Maybe widowed Madame de Charny (Jeanne de Vergy) had not been fully apprised of her late husband’s and King’s game plan, using the ‘genuine’ Shroud as a down payment, and more concerned post Poitiers disaster to provide for herself and her orphaned children? This comment is already quite long and starting to deviate, so I’ll post this as a prologue and then return with the detailed haematology later this morning (my time zone). King John and his close buddy Geoffroi de Charny of Lirey will have to go onto the post Apocalypse back burner for now, with maybe a speculative posting on my own site, sometime in the New Year.

With few if any custodians, later ones especially, not having seen the full length shroud, only the face, we are asked to believe they didn’t even know of the double body image. So if they didn’t know of the full length double body image, then why all the secrecy for a face that WAS on display? Why not leave records, or merely an oral tradition, to be recorded later on paper, to the effect that the exposed face was simply a Veronica like imprint, possibly captured post mortem, complementing the pre mortem imprint of legend onto Veronica’s head scarf?

How many could repress the information that there was evidence from the blood of nails in hands and feet, and of a lance wound?

It cannot have been shown that way for many reasons….” As it happens, I agree, certainly if one reads the Wilson account with its relatively few foldings being used to isolate the face from the rest of the image (the precise number of foldings depending on how one interprets ‘tetradiplon’). I reckoned on 24 layers of linen to isolate the face, but stand to be corrected (but at least I resorted to your Shroud Scope with a graduated steel rule to arrive at that estimate, so must surely deserve some brownie points for effort). But even if Wilson is wrong, and we need to suppose that a few foldings would have exposed much more than the face alone, it doesn’t alter the main point I am making, namely that there is no record of a full length DOUBLE body image ever being displayed prior to Lirey in 1355 approx. What’s more, there is no evidence, at least in the written or artistic record, of such a double image ever being in the public domain prior to Lirey.The latter would not necessarily have required a public display, merely ‘leakage” by a loose tongued insider of what lay hidden in a frame or reliquary behind the Image of Edessa/Mandylion.

If the TS had been folded so as to expose just the face with a bit of border and then mounted in a frame, anyone picking it up would notice first of all the weight, given that the total linen would weigh approximately 24 times what was expected if a simple single layer portrait. Their next response might be to tap the stretched linen lightly to explore further and instead of getting the expected springy response expected from a single layer of linen, their fingers would sink into a wad of linen 24 layers thick. So they would realize immediately that they were looking at a small part of a much larger image. Let’s now suppose that the lowest part of the face terminates at chin and/or neck level say. The natural thing would be to slip in one’s fingers to see what was lower down. Do that and one starts to see scourge marks on the upper torso. That would surely be the cue to investigate further down, or to see what was above the head (though admittedly one has to probe a fair distance to discover the second ‘inverted’ head). Sorry, I simply do not buy into the idea that a heavier than expected framed face with no image cut off at chin/neck level would be taken for granted as “just a compact portrait” of the face only, especially given the enigmatic ‘negative’ character alluded to earlier, to say nothing of the reasonably realistic looking bloodstains on the forehead, hair etc that would indicate that one was looking at something ominously different from a standard portrait, or even a Veronica like imprint of the face only.

Why? Because it is the first appearance in history of the iconic double body image, completely naked, as we see on the TS. Attempts in a magazine article to invest the Lirey image (receiving scant attention) with a loin cloth that is NOT on the badge, NOR on the TS, may have helped to ‘sell’ a dubious hypothesis, ie. That it’s just a painting, conscious of finer sensibilities, and thus originally prudish, or so we are led to believe, but from where I’m standing his thesis looks to me like dud misguided scholarship – a hunch lacking any kind of solid backing evidence. I’m willing to view book writer Charles Freeman as a Shroud ‘historian’ – but not as an ‘academic historian’.

But your section on the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge, taxing, indeed mind numbing as it is to anyone attempting to extract any meaning, finally seems to say that the makers of the Lirey badge chose to show the body as naked, implying there was a loin cloth on the original TS (which you claim has since selectively worn away, along with crown of thorns). That suggestion is TOTALLY without a shred of evidence, and has to be seen as a self serving attempt to embroider a junk hypothesis. Here’s the passage in question. I leave folks here to judge for themselves.Enjoy! “There is one more fascinating feature of the painting of the Shroud and it concerns the loincloth. A Pilgrim Badge of c.1355 shows the images on the Shroud as naked. Two hundred years later, in a depiction of the Shroud taken from a prayer book of Marguerite de Valois, dated to 1559, the images are still naked. Only 20 years later, when the Shroud was exposed in Turin in 1578 after its transfer to his new capital by Duke Emanuele Filiberto I, the loincloth was on it: an engraving of this exposition by Giovanni Testa shows it clearly. It continues to be shown in depictions of the next two centuries, with enough similarity between portrayals to suggest that artists were copying from the original. Why was it suddenly there? While I was researching depictions of the Shroud I was shown an engraving from the Royal Library in Turin. Engraved by Carlo Malliano in Rome in 1579, it had been reproduced in different formats with the Shroud as a template, always with a loincloth in place, although with different figures and backgrounds associated with it. In the Turin Library example the presiding clergyman was Francesco Lamberti, Bishop of Nice (which was then within Savoy territory). Intriguingly, Lamberti had been present at the Council of Trent in 1563 and had signed the decree banning lascivia in religious art, the same decree that had led to the nude figures in Michelangelo’s Last Judgement being covered up. Had Lamberti insisted on placing the loincloth on the Shroud? Possibly: but there was another candidate. The exposition of 1578 was important because the star guest welcoming the Shroud’s arrival in Turin was none other than the archbishop of Milan, Carlo Borromeo, a devotee of the Shroud, who visited it not just in 1578 but in 1581, 1582 and 1584, the year of his death. One of the most powerful figures of the Counter Reformation, Borromeo had been secretary to his uncle, Pius IV, in the closing sessions of the Council of Trent of 1562 63. He approved of the decree on lascivia and insisted that Milanese artists followed it. It is likely, therefore, to have been either Lamberti or Borromeo who insisted that the naked buttocks of the image be covered up with a painted loincloth. Today the loincloth has vanished and only a lighter patch over the buttocks suggests its previous existence.” As for peer review, the process for books, intended for popular consumption, is ENTIRELY different from that of paper submitted to a learned journal.

Where is the evidence that STURP found calcium carbonate? Finding calcium was not surprising, given that flax has Ca++ in counter ion association with the negatively charged pectin, i.e. Calcium pectate. Since the pectin and assoiated Ca++ is not completely biodegraded in retting, there’s still calcium pectate in linen. I repeat: where’s the evidence for calcium carbonate specifically? I have yet to see any., or even recognition that calcium does not equate with calcium carbonate unless one has hard analytical data in support of that contention. 2. Let’s consider for a moment the prominent bas relief nature of the figure on the Lirey badge, and the need to fashion a complementary sunken relief mould from the soft stone. That’s sounds like a lot of intricate work, especially given the small scale. I shall try and find what tools and/or techniques were needed to end up with smooth sunken contours in the stone mould, making the reasonable assumption that the Lirey badge was produced from a Machy type mould. For now the key question is “Why would anyone go to all that trouble if merely wishing to represent a painting in miniature? They could simply have engraved, ie scratched lightly, as per the herringbone background, if wishing to portray a mere painting. Yup, someone here seems to have overlooked the fact that a medieval artisan must have gone to a great deal of time and trouble to link the Shroud double body image on its very first display with 3 D properties, reinforcing the idea of an IMPRINT left by a real 3 D person, albeit recently deceased, on the authentic or proxy Joseph of Arimathea’s ‘fine linen’ (take your pick). One picture, or in this instance, 3 D bas relief artefact, is worth a 1000 words, especially as words in the wrong or inept hands can so easily be misrepresented or misconstrued...","date":"2015-12-12","mins":"12:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"id":"comment-216275","author":"colin_berry","post":"” Read the STURP report on physics and chemistry which you no doubt have at hand. ” But there is no single and detailed STURP report on physics and chemistry. There’s the brief 1981 Summary but it makes no mention of calcium and/or calcium carbonate. The detailed STURP findings are scattered through a plethora of conference contributions, published papers or personal memoirs by its individual collaborators. So I ask you again: where is the hard analytical evidence to be found for calcium carbonate? Please tell me precisely where you came by that information, and in passing how you were able to distinguish between calcium carbonate as used in artists’ gesso, and randomly scattered contamination by calcium carbonate in adventitious dust (rock particles).

Where on earth might they have acquired that anarchic notion? Might it be that unlike some here those artists actually took the trouble to read a few key verses from scripture before applying paint to canvas (it being so tedious to have to scrape off and start again if later told one has got the story wrong). Yes, that’s it, they must have read somewhere that the body was “taken down” and placed in linen, Joseph’s fine linen, before arrival at the sepulchre. Might that be because all three synoptic accounts say essentially the same thing (well, they would, wouldn’t they, being tediously synoptic an’ all). It’s only when you get to John that, viewed in isolation, the possibility arises of the body having arrived at the tomb without being wrapped in linen (though some might consider that merely an error of omission). It’s an uncharitable thought I know, but might it be that over close acquaintance with a highly blood stained Shroud of Turin has caused some telescoping of chronology in certain minds, away from the synoptics, towards a somewhat partisan version of John’s account, one that imagines that Jesus was not placed in Joseph’s linen until after arrival at the tomb, and that Joseph’s linen was intended to serve not as an intermediary cover between cross and tomb, but as the final burial shroud? Handy that, being a single sheet, allowing one to dismiss talk of “winding sheets” as having lost something in translation, or being totally at odds with 1st century Jewish burial customs (oh, and don’t mention the Pray Codex either, unless it’s to point out the L shaped poker holes). Personally, I consider that the authenticist position on the TS should be about fitting the facts re the TS to the biblical account(s), as distinct from bending or shoehorning the biblical account to fit one or other “expert’s” tendentious dogma re the TS as to how it came to acquire this or that pattern of image v blood. After all, we still don’t know for certain how the image was formed. We can’t be absolutely certain that blood arrived before image. We can’t be absolutely certain it’s real whole human blood that is 2000 rather than 1300 years old. Better methinks to take the gospels as gospel truth, instead of allowing approx 4 square metres of linen to place a masking shroud over certain verses deemed inconvenient to one’s narrative..","date":"2014-12-03","mins":"2:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/02/wikified-word-of-the-day/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Wikified:  Word of the Day"},{"id":"comment-174420","author":"colin_berry","post":"Correction: 600 700 years old, not 1300..","date":"2014-12-03","mins":"2:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/02/wikified-word-of-the-day/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Wikified:  Word of the Day"},{"id":"comment-173060","author":"colin_berry","post":"Snap.
