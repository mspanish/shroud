How ,much more of this do we have to endure from daveb? There IS a written historical document, as he knows full well, one which semi professional apologists for TS authenticity like our dave B try to dismiss and/or debunk. It’s called the d’Arcis memorandum (1389). It sets out the belief of a Troyes bishop, shared by his predecessor Henri de Poitiers, that the Shroud was a ‘cunningly painted’ fake, a “sleight of hand”. So to suggest there is no historical record of the Shroud being a fake, given the existence of that memorandum, written in medieval Latin, shows an utter contempt for the facts. Daveb went down hugely in this blogger’s estimation when he began pushing that line, citing a certain legalistic hatchet job as further evidence, which I read and quickly discounted, given its clearly agenda driven lack of objectivity. How can he claim with a straight face that the “imagined success” of the Lirey shroud “remains inexplicable” when one reads the d’Arcis account of what was being claimed, namely that it was the genuine burial shroud of Jesus, and that there were hired mercenaries among the pilgrims declaring that the Shroud had cured them of their maladies? It should be self evident that the success of the venture depended on maintaining absolute secrecy, only partly breached by d’Arcis, in that he omitted to name the artisan or describe the precise means of producing the image, except to say it was no ordinary “painting”. Had it been just any bog standard painting, as tediously maintained by Charles Freeman in the face of a mountain of contrary evidence, there would have been no commemorative medallion, now in the Cluny Museum. (Nobody would go to the trouble and expense of producing a medallion – the Lirey Pilgrim’s badge – merely to celebrate a painting, least of all one with the double imprint of a naked man – in passing, NO liturgical loin cloth, NO liturgical crown of thorns – and shown dramatically as semi 3 D bas relief). Nobody would leave duplicate versions of his handiwork either, given that would have totally defeated the aim of the venture, namely to produce a credible one off relic, one that trumped all other other relics. I shall now take another long holiday from this vexatious site (and its vexatious blow hot and cold owner). I shall be on the look out for new forums on which to share my thinking re the medieval origins of the Lirey/Turin body imprinted envelope. I.e. As an intended magnet for the faithful, rivalling or eclipsing the then fabled Veil of Veronica. Shame that thread on Fort Wayne’s News Sentinel site did not attract more comments.

It matters not whether those bishops would or would not have been able to substantiate their charge of forgery in a court of law. We are discussing history, not legalities. All that matters is that they made a charge of forgery in what is now a crucial historical source. Prior to the Lirey displays, they were totally unaware of the existence of the TS with its double imprint. Nor is there evidence for that distinctive and eye catching double imprint in the earlier artistic record. Why not? Answer: because the TS appeared as if from nowhere, with no accompanying explanation as to its recent history or origins, arousing entirely rational suspicions of forgery, and quite rightly so. The d’Arcis memorandum is precisely what one would have expected from a bishop seeing hundreds or thousands of pilgrims converging on a tiny humble timber constructed church of recent foundation, not under his jurisdiction, having been founded with ‘collegiate’ status only (now there’s a surprise).There are no serious grounds whatsoever to doubt the historical validity of the d’Arcis memorandum in principle, lacking though it may be in precise detail. Contrast that with the failure of pro authenticists to produce a single written document making reference to the Lirey Shroud prior to 1350, and the absurd and near total reliance on minute and inconsistent ink drawn features scattered among different sketches in a Hungarian Codex, with no corroboration WHATSOEVER from the accompanying WRITTEN text. What’s that if not a desperate and pitiful scraping of the art world barrel tactic designed to fend off the claim that there’s not a single shred of documentary evidence on which to base a claim for the TS existing prior to 1350?.","date":"2015-07-14","mins":"3:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"id":"comment-205480","author":"colin_berry","post":"“I think that Colin has thought further into the actual functions of the various cloths associated with the burial of Jesus than either the Gospel writers or most medieval artists ever bothered with.” There’s a third category, Hugh, which you’ve omitted to mention: someone who was envious of mid 14th century Rome’s premier relic (icon?) namely the Veil of Veronica, and who sought a niche within the biblical story into which a similar concept of body imprinting could be accommodated. One was found: the time interval between Joseph of Arimathea arriving at the cross with his linen, and when the newly enveloped body then arriving at the tomb for removal and discarding of the ‘transport’ linen, to be replaced by Nicodemus’s winding strips. During that transport interval, our medieval entrepreneur could imagine as his ‘model’ an imprinting of a whole body, back and front, onto the up and over length of linen, essentially reproducing post mortem the imaging process that medieval folk seemed willing to have occurred on a smaller scale to produce the Veil of Veronica. Sorry, the term “shroud” is now associated entirely with funeral garments. I’ve never heard of the modern ‘body bag’ as being described as a shroud, even if quickly replaced by one when a cadaver is turned over to a funeral director by a hospital mortuary.

Here’s just onme example, culled from your current comment: “Essentially the synoptics say that Joseph brought a Shroud, took the body down, wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in the tomb, no mention of using it for transport at all.” If one takes a body down from a cross, wraps it in linen so as to shield from public gaze, and then takes the wrapped corpse to a nearby garden with rock tomb, then what is that if not “transport”? Maybe you are unhappy with the idea that good quality linen might be strong enough to act as a makeshift stretcher. Maybe you envisage some other means of transferring an enveloped corpse from cross to tomb that does not place stress on the linen. But it’s still TRANSPORT. The use of an up and over length of linen allows for discreet and dignified transport of a crucified man, bloodied, probably naked. That surely has to be seen as the primary role of Joseph of Arimathea’s linen which the synoptic gospels make clear was taken first to the CROSS ,not the tomb. It’s then asking rather a lot that transport linen that becomes soiled with blood and other body fluid should then serve a dual role as final burial shroud. The account of John does indeed suggest strongly that Nicodemus provided a customized replacement that was designed for “winding” in accordance with Jewish burial custom. As I said earlier, the Pray Codex actually shows what appears to be both types of linen in the same picture, so it’s not as if I am pushing a novel or fanciful line,. I’m simply noting that Joseph’s linen served an immediate role for TRANSPORT, and was not intended as the final burial shroud, that being presumably narrow and bandage like if wound repeatedly around the limbs and torso of a corpse to sequester and incorporate spices etc at all main points of the body, with a separate “napkin” for the face which is NOT a feature of the Turin so called Shroud. PS: I’m at a time of life when I accept there are those whose interpretation of the written word can differ radically from my own. It’s not just semantics: it’s about underlying agendas.

He failed to do a very strong marketing campaign as the concept of ‘full body Veronica’ did not enter the medieval culture. Did he attempt to promote the icon as the ‘full body Veronica’ only to be disappointed to have it interpreted as the actual burial linen?” Yes David, but there’s a crucial difference. The Veronica was seen as a proto photograph of Jesus while still alive, albeit scourged, weighed down with cross etc. It did not have the same funereal qualities as one “taken” with the same tactile image capturing process AFTER death. Let’s not forget either that artists felt free to enhance the Veronica image – the vast majority possibly all being attractive ‘positives’ – because it was considered that a miraculous process had allowed even the initial imprinting. Not so with the TS – the image there is uncompromisingly a negative, and not one that artists felt should be enhanced, perhaps because of its stark, unenhanced post mortem nature. As for how the TS was marketed, surely the d’Arcis memorandum makes clear that the ‘new’ relic caught on immediately. The fact that it beget its own commemorative medal, possible two (thinking of the Machy mould) must count for something. Which reminds me (Machy mould) – that inset face of Jesus above the word SUAIRE was surely a marketing ploy – inviting the pilgrim to make a connection with the Veronica, to see the image as a whole body IMPRINT, albeit more sombre, more ghostly, more haunting. A face, even in extremis, is always more viewer friendly than a whole body take, especially one that needs strategically placed hands etc… The link with the Veronica is more about technical precedent – tactile imprinting – than artistic genre..","date":"2015-07-13","mins":"10:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"id":"comment-180982","author":"colin_berry","post":"One of us finds the appearance of whatiffery a refreshing change from the usual and invariably circular whataboutery.

Http://pioneer.chula.ac.th/~pukrit/bba/js.pdf Here’s a taster (with no spoiler): A moment before there had come up for judgment a philosopher, deceased full of years and honours, who had told the Eternal to his face that he did not believe in him. It was not this that would have disturbed the serenity of the King of Kings, this could only have made him smile; but the philosopher, taking perhaps an unfair advantage of the regrettable happenings just then upon Earth, had asked him how, considering them dispassionately, it was possible to reconcile his All Power with his All Goodness. “No one can deny the fact of Evil,” said the philosopher, sententiously. “Now, if God cannot prevent Evil he is not all powerful, and if he can prevent it and will not, he is not all good.” This argument was of course not new to the Omniscient, but he had always refused to consider the matter; for the fact is, though he knew everything, he did not know the answer to this. Even God cannot make two and two five. But the philosopher, pressing his advantage, and, as philosophers often will, drawing from a reasonable premise an unjustifiable inference – the philosopher had finished with a statement that in the circumstances was surely preposterous. “I will not believe,” he said, “in a God who is not All Powerful and All Good.” See the link above to see how the little morality tale ends (and starts).

It’s that energy, distributed between quantized electron energy levels, with electron transitions (“jumps”) between those orbitals, that allows them to form bonds with each other in a vast number of different arrangements (generating the near ‘miraculous’ degree of complexity at the molecular level that might, just might, have finally resulted in spontaneous biogenesis, admittedly against all the odds)..","date":"2015-01-02","mins":"8:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"id":"comment-181909","author":"colin_berry","post":"Sadly there are folk on this planet who fail to see that their god is neither all good, nor all powerful, when (or if) allowing self appointed assassins acting allegedly in his name to dispense divine judgement via summary execution of unarmed civilians by AK 47. It’s one thing to believe in the existence of God. But believing in God does not automatically give privileged insights into the mind of one’s God. Anti theists are not always confirmed atheists.Their real beef is with those who presume to know the mind of their God, simply because they have rejected atheism. An entity that we humans call God has by definition to be all powerful, but there is absolutely no logical reason why that entity should be all good. The latter is mere wishful thinking – albeit human in the finest sense of the word. An all good God does not populate a planet with living creatures on an orbiting sphere with a still molten core, with powerful convection currents in the mantle close to the surface, producing continental drift, tectonic plate collision and subduction. Result: unpredictable earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis etc that indiscriminately wipe out thousands of men, women and children, God fearing and God worshipping included. That’s without considering the hazard of asteroid impacts that could occur anytime, and indeed have happened in the past, causing major species extinction. Why would an all good, all powerful creator populate our planet with a diversity of life forms, merely to allow later partial or complete annihilation? Enjoy life while you can, that’s my motto. Be philosophical about mortality. Philosophy beats religion any day. The only mind one needs to know is one’s own.

There’s surely a problem with that – namely with the risen Christ having been at pains to display nail wounds and wound in the side. Why would a re materialized spirit still carry the mortal injuries that had caused death? Suppose that Christ, instead of being crucified, had been beheaded. Resurrection as a spiritual bodily presence that still conserved the physical signs of the manner of death would have resulted in an inability to communicate via speech – which as we know requires continuity between lungs and voice box.

Explain that Rogers is suggesting, nay, specifying, the provenance of reducing sugars for a Maillard reaction with gaseous putrefaction amines which according to him created the sepia Shroud image). Tell them that the Rogers’ hypothesis has almost acquired the status of holy writ in some impressionable quarters (like Adler’s bilirubin brainwave to account for that permanently red “blood”). “Observations of weave density and lignin content of the shroud fibres (Rogers, 2001) indicate a very mild bleaching technique in agreement with the methods described by Pliny the Elder (77). The same technology was in use, with some minor differences, until after the last crusade in 1291 (Hochberg, 1980). Linen was spun by hand on a spindle whorl. When the spindle was full, the spinner made a hank of thread. Each hank of thread was bleached separately, and each was a little different. Different parts of the same thread in the shroud’s weave show slightly different colours, like a variegated yarn. The warp thread was protected with starch during the weaving process, making the cloth stiff. The final cloth was washed in a solution made from Saponaria officinalis. Saponaria produces four glycosidic saponins, and all hydrolyse to produce sugar chains. (Ya Chirva et al., 1969) The following carbohydrates were identified in those chains: galactose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, fucose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid. The presence of starch, in particular amilose (sic) , on the shroud was confirmed by the fact that during testing for sulfoproteins in blood areas with an iodine azide reagent (which bubbles vigorously when sulfur is present), a reddish background was formed.” That’s all I want to say….","date":"2012-05-15","mins":"3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"id":"comment-2265","author":"colin_berry","post":"Here’s a comment from The Venerable Hugh that has just this minute appeared on The Other Site (the one that insists on holding up any comments I post there while Mr.Prissy checks them out for unseemly language – while allowing everyone to make their snide character attacks on me): September 8, 2013 at 4:59 am | #15 Thanks, Yannick, but I’m afraid I still can’t agree with you. 1) Can anyone find a reference to Mc Crone finding starch on the shroud except what is mentioned by Rogers himself? 2) Can anyone (Colin, perhaps, if he’s ever on board these days) say whether the ‘ghost’ coloration on the Mylar tape could be due to the detachment of the primary cell wall of fibres rather than an ‘impurity layer’? 3) Although Heller and Adler failed to report finding any starch on the shroud, do we “have to assume” that they did find it but failed to report it? 4) Can Thibault Heimburger, one of the authors of the paper, and who does read this blog from time to time, confirm that Fanti was “was not willing at all to even mention Rogers’ impurity hypothesis” until forced to do so? ……………………………………………….. Frankly, I cannot be arsed (pardon the internet lingo) with Mr.Rogers’ so called “impurity layer”. Maybe if he had taken the time or trouble to work in a Ph D training in his career, his supervisor would have quickly disabused him of what probably is the most common error in scientific research. Yes, it’s good to have ideas, hypotheses, working models etc – all of which might be described as mental constructs. But what one must NEVER do is embrace a mental construct so closely that it becomes essentially “fact”, such well established fact that you cannot be bothered to do the essential experimentation. But that is precisely what Mr.Rogers did – he took his “impurity layer” – a mental construct – and elevated it to the level of fact, with the result that some very silly and impressionable people, notably Yannick Clement on the other site, bang on endlessly about the “impurity layer”, and attack anyone who reminds folk that there’s a better candidate for the superficial image receptive layer of flax fibres, namely that primary cell wall (PCW). Yes, Mr.Rogers could not be arsed to verify the existence of his own impurity layer, being content to make vague references to what others allegedly saw using reagents designed to look for something else (an iodine/azide reagent was used to test for sulphur proteins – not starch). Whether the PCW can be the entity that stripped off so easily with Mylar tape is something I’m not sure about. If it is, then that should not be too difficult to demonstrate in model studies with modern linen. What seems clear is that something that Mr. Clement thinks is needed to explain the discontinuous nature of the Shroud image should strip away so cleanly as a skin, pellicle, film etc. Without disintegrating.

That view is currently being promoted on ‘the other site’ by a medically trained lady anaesthetist (or anesthesiologist as they say in the US where she works). Not true. It is ordinary visible white light from fluorescent tubes that is used, and it the visible blue component that is absorbed by the yellow/orange bilirubin, whose absorption maximum is approx 450nm. So all the speculation about the “too red” bloodstains on the Shroud maybe only looking too red when viewed in broad daylight, the latter providing some “obligatory” uv component is pure tosh. There’s more sloppy and mistaken so called science from the same source appearing on a daily basis, and has been for some weeks now. The lady has only the most superficial understanding of physiological topics relevant to the Shroud, yet sets herself up as an authority, issuing rebukes to those of us who attempt to correct her errors, and we then find ourselves the target for offensive comments that question our mental state.

It is chemically stable, showing reactivity towards a fairly narrow range other substances, notably oxygen but requiring high temperatures to kick start the combustion to CO2. Of course, CO in the atmosphere may last only a few months, without combustion, though still being oxidised finally to CO2, but that is more a reflection of the reactivity of the tiny concentrations of highly reactive OH.

The spectra obtained with addition of bilirubin and methemoglobin is non additive : As far as color is concerned, red means more relative absorption in blue/violet.” ——————————————————————— That link makes the point better than anything I can say as to why all of Adler’s data need to be searchable and accessible online, and not just in copyrighted books and so called ‘Orphaned Manuscripts’ (redacted). The proposition being floated there is just plain ludicrous – namely that if mixing A and B reinforces absorption in particular parts of the spectrum – notably the blue/violet you mention – then regardless of what is happening elsewhere – you re assured of your intensification of red colour. One does not often meet intensely blood red colours in the laboratory, so when one does, it pays to look closely at the absorption spectrum. A simple model compound for “blood” is iron(III) thiocyanate, with the Fe(CNS) ++ ion. When you look at its absorption spectrum, there is a single almost symmetrical peak, centred approximately on 480nm: That’s the only kind of spectrum that guarantees that a compound will be blood red – one with a single peak at that value. I’m not saying that there cannot under any circumstances be secondary peaks or shoulders, simply that Adler’s mixing exercise is worthless unless one has a photograph of the end result – to be certain that a convincing blood red colour really has been achieved. A set of absorption spectra on their own tell one next to nothing – and can in fact be highly misleading. Do you think that mixing bilirubin and oxidized haemoglobin would produce an end result that was virtually indistinguishable to the viewer from fresh blood?

There are videos on youtube to support this theory….” ############################################# Well, jasaun, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since I was involved in that ‘discussion’ – or should we say browbeating, only partly deserved from the schoolteacher I now call the Valkyrie, given her tendency to swoop on me from out of the blue. You see, that apparent length difference was just of one dozens of characteristics I had listed that seemed at the time to cast doubt on the Shroud’s authenticity. I had seen the same discrepancy in other people’s images, including one in a Cathedral, Italian as I recall, where there was a Shroud exhibition, but being a science bod, someone who takes nobody’s word for it, had decided to check it out for myself. That meant taking a head to head image, dividing it into two between the two heads, then rotating the top one so that the frontal and dorsal images were side by side, feet to feet. The dorsal image did indeed look taller than the frontal, and indeed bulkier around the shoulders. I simply noted it and moved on. Result: the Valkyrie swooped, said I had committed the grossest of errors, not worthy of one of her 9th(?) grade students, was a disgrace to science, and even suggesting I had rigged the comparison! What i had not fully appreciated at the time was that the apparent length of the feet on the dorsal image looks greater than if the figure were standing upright, because it is the underside of the feet that is imaged, almost as if the linen had been pulled around the heel, and then taken to the tips of the toes, without a similar right angle turn (push rather than press) being performed on the frontal feet images (which are scarcely discernible anyway). If one aligns the images shoulder to shoulder, it is then possible to see there may be no real height difference (although published detailed measurements do suggest that one is a few centimetres taller). I can look up the references if you wish. Running a science based blog is all too often a case of “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” – certainly if one’s observations get picked up elsewhere. You then find yourself being blasted for trying to “blind lay folk with science” or being accused of being sloppy, taking liberties, of engaging in deception if one tries to keep things light and conversational, as I occasionally do, at least for starters. What was especially annoying where that lady is concerned (and she still hovers to this day) is the way she prejudges – and occasionally resorts to defamation of character – having had one of her hair curling comments removed from TOS The Other Site) without waiting to hear my reply. Methinks some people have made a heavy emotional stake in the Shroud being authentic, and anyone who attempts to question authenticity from a scientific standpoint, as I do, can find themselves under attack, not because the detailed science is wrong (though my first impressions re the relative lengths were admittedly premature and unwise, even as one item in a long list) but because one is a “pseudoskeptic” as a NY lawyer has called me. Instead of attacking the science, folk attack the scientist, and in some cases are only a whisker away from attacking science in general ( see Pam Moon on David Rolfe’s Shroud Enigma site). Forgive me if I stop there. I’m sure that John Jackson will be delighted to see the way your thoughts are running in a supernatural direction, but coming from STURP’s lead scientist who initiated the famous science bash cum dash in Turin all those years ago, I do wonder how much the world knew at the time about his theological interests/agenda, as plainly on view if you visit his Shroud Center site, or read the “critical summaries” that emanate from that source, or see the way he tried every means in the book to discredit the radiocarbon dating in the BBC documentary, or read his “collapsing cloth” theory. John Jackson lectures in physics, but from where I am standing his radiation theories are ‘fizics’, not worthy of the term physics (try looking for scholarly examination of heat conduction or convection as alternatives to radiation. ) Somebody had to say it (even STURP’s Alan D.Adler once described Jackson’s collapsing cloth theory as unscientific). PS I am going back to the drawing board on my new site, and have wiped the contents, except for the Home Page title.

Here’s my latest result just an hour or so old: I’ll describe in detail how it was obtained in my next blog posting (which may take a day or two). For now let’s just say that a viscous dispersion was made of white flour in hot water that was then painted onto my brass crucifix. A negative image was imprinted onto linen that was then allowed to dry (becoming near invisible). The imprinted linen was then suspended overnight in a jar filled with nitric acid (HNO3) fumes. The linen turns a beige colour (aged look?) with the faint yellow brown imprint you see above (the photo has been autocorrected in MS Office Picture Manager). There was no appreciable reverse side image, possibly because the swollen gelatinized wheat starch granules still have some kind of particulate properties, making it difficult to penetrate the weave. These are early days. There’s a vast number of changes that can be rung with this ‘nitric fumigation’ model. I’ve briefly tested the effect of increasing the N Ox content in the fumigation jar (by adding copper wire that generates visible NO2 as red brown fumes, and no doubt invisible NO as well). The extra N Ox does not appear to improve on the mainly HNO3 developed image you see above. Note the parallel with pre digital photography, using a developing agent to produce a visible image. That allows for constant visual inspection to achieve an optimised end result, unlike ‘hit or miss’ contact scorching with a heated template. As I say, it’s not photography, but chemography.

One can have the right ideas for the wrong reasons and vice versa. That’s science bizz. Prior to that, the blood first image second chronology had been a huge embarrassment for the scorch hypothesis. In a forgery scenario, one needed the image first in order to know where to apply the blood, and I made no attempt to wave aside the problem. So forgive me if I say that this current ‘chemograph’ hypothesis, based on initial painting or smearing with a gooey paste or gel followed immediately by application of blood to all the right places is not “going to great lengths” as you put it. It’s a simple straightforward way to end up with a combined blood/body image that is consistent with the deposition of a crucified man into Joseph of Arimathea’s linen (straight from the cross in fact, before transport to tomb, with the linen acting as a makeshift stretcher, as reflected in a lot of medieval art, or indeed as up and over ‘body bag’ in modern parlance, it being the decent thing to do to a deceased and bloodied man while spectators are still present). No, the forgers would not have been in the least bit concerned about the fact that blood image was under body image, or have given it a second thought. All that mattered from a practical standpoint was successful transfer of blood from subject to linen despite the presence of an ‘undercoat’ on the SUBJECT (not final linen) of body imprinting goo. Reminder: in the current model, goo and blood are being applied to the subject, not the linen. In passing, note the different geometry vis a vis Luigi Garlaschelli’s frottage model, where the linen is laid over subject first, then powder or slurry applied piecemeal onto the top surface under constant visual surveillance (“No, add a bit more there…). That is not pure ‘passive’ imprinting technology in my view, the prolonged manual moulding tempting the operative to add ‘artistic’ effects that are not possible when the two imprinting media are out of sight UNDER the linen. There’s then a real risk of going “too far round the sides” and risking excessive lateral distortion, os which there’s some on the TS , but very slight and not immediately apparent we’re told. 100% passive imprinting is more likely to give the necessary high grade 3 D rendering, free of obvious wrap around effects, in my humble opinion than anything that allows for artistic licence, no matter how minimal.

Is it any wonder then that the initially scorched area will show some movement relative to the furrows and crevices of the fabric when you have thermal expansion and contraction going on? That’s quite apart from any mechanical stretching of the fabric that takes place when one presses a hot template into the fabric with some force with a view to getting a good imprint. That stretching of the fabric will tend to temporarily flatten the fabric, i.e. The crowns will tend to drop into the general plane of the weave, and that will then expose parts of the thread adjacent to the crowns that were previously NOT proud of the surface. When the fabric cools and contracts, those additionally scorched areas will tend to retreat once more into the furrows and crevices. I do think you have to (attempt to) refute the idea of scorching by direct contact at a more general level, if you don’t mind my saying, and not try to conjure up killer arguments that depend on speculation about the incidental details.

One would also expect a sharp demarcation where the banding starts or stops, but it is not sharp, especially on the subject’s right side of the face, where the prominent cheek bone and/or swelling runs into the “dark area”. The hair too seems largely unaffected where it crosses the banded region. If the difference in image intensity were really due to banding, one might have expected the equalisation to bring the dark regions up to the luminance level of the light. But it’s been done in reverse – reducing the luminance of the light to match the dark, and therefore failing to reveal new detail in the dark region (ears?), and reducing the attractiveness of the image generally. Why? Because there is no imaging worth speaking of at the periphery of the face, and that would have become all too apparent if that part had been intensified. The real reason why the sides are not well imaged is because they present tangentially to the cloth. That’s why other parts that are not at the sides but which also present tangentially – like the underside of the chin and the eye sockets are also dark, i.e. Poorly imaged, while the eyelids and other parts that present square on (extremity of nose, brow ridge, chin etc) are well imaged.

That suggests that poor imaging is due primarily to geometrical factors to do with body cloth contact – rather than to any major variation in the ability of different fabric yarns to accept and record an image. The inevitable conclusion is that the image is imprinted onto the superficial PCW, which is approximately of constant depth and chemical composition all over, rather than on an impurity layer that would tend to be somewhat variable, even over relatively short distances – tending to produce a patchy image.

My impression is that gifted chemist thought he was, he was simply not au fait with botanical principles, did not appreciate the superficial nature of the PCW and the ease with which it could be chemically modified and/or stripped away relative to highly crystalline cellulose of the secondary cell wall, so immediately looked to Pliny and impurities to explain why the image layer could be stripped away so readily. So while it is true that starch and its degradation products, as well as the pentosan sugars in saponins – both of which he presumed to be present without offering high grade analytical data to back up those two assumptions – are chemically more reactive and easier to modify than crystalline cellulose, the proper comparison should have been with PCW hemicelluloses – a connection which Rogers failed to make (please correct me if I you think I am mistaken).

Here;s what i said. Quotation from Raymond Rogers’ 2004 (written one year before his demise): My italics: “Where darker bands of yarn intersect image areas, the image is darker. Where lighter bands intersect an image area, the image appears lighter. This proves that the image color is not a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen. Some impurities on the surface of the different batches of yarn produced the image color. This observation is extremely important when tests are being made on image formation hypotheses. If image color is not simply a result of color formation in the cellulose of the linen fibers, image formation must be a much more complex process than we originally thought.” My response: We see an image by the light that it reflects or scatters onto our retinas, but the latter depends not only on the light absorbing/reflecting properties of the image itself (obviously) but, less obviously, on what is underneath the image. That is especially the case where the image is exceedingly thin and superficial. If the underlay were, say, pure matt black, absorbing all light that passed through the image layer and fell on it, then less light can be reflected/scattered back to illuminate the image layer from underneath, and the image will tend to look darker than it would be in the absence of the underlay. Conversely, if the underlay were pure white linen, with a propensity to reflect/scatter white light, then there would be additional illumination from underneath, and the image layer would look brighter. It follows that an image on darker coloured weave will tend to look darker than one on lighter coloured weave., due to differences in illumination from BELOW. These considerations render null and void the claim of Raymond Rogers (RIP) that the image is not imprinted on the fibre itself, but in a superficial impurity coating. The effect he describes, and failed properly to interpret, tells one NOTHING whatsoever about where the image is located, except that is somewhat superficial. “This proves that the image color is not a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen.”? Nope, it proves nothing… There is other evidence too that the assumption by Rogers that the image is in an impurity layer (largely based it seems on the writings of Pliny), formed by a purely hypothetical Maillard reaction between supposed reducing sugars in the impurities and volatile amines from post mortem decay (cadaverine, putrescine etc) is ruled out by Rogers’ own observation in the same paper that the Shroud’s image bearing areas are not enriched in nitrogen.

Why? Because the photographs in question are light dark reversed relative to the image on the Shroud, so what we see as two prominent dark bands, one on each side of the face, look far more dominant a feature of the image than is the case when viewing the “pseudo negative” of the Shroud. One also suspects that there has been adjustment of the brightness/contrast control that accentuates the so called banding effect. Anyone inclined to think that the banding is due primarily to yarn differences could do a lot worse than look at an HD picture of the Shroud in close up, one that shows the image in relation to the herring bone weave. Here’s a link to the picture , apparently a video still, which David Rolfe briefly placed into the public domain – as a banner on his Enigma blog – and then inexplicably withdrew. I have taken his “positive” and reversed it back to a pseudo negative, as per Shroud. Look closely and you will see the “banding” as two lighter regions close to the outer limits of the eyes, with darker regions resuming where the hair is imaged.There is no abrupt transition from light to dark, as one might imagine from the positives. Indeed, the imaging of the eyebrows extends into the banded region, showing that the image is still there, albeit weaker, but definitely not absent. That would argue against any suggestion of a tenting effect that prevented any image imprinting at all, at least in a model that disallows imaging if there is a sizeable gap between subject and cloth. What fascinates me most about the Rolfe HD image is not so much the banding, as those two “bloodstains”, and the manner in which they are largely indistinguishable from other imaged areas inasmuch as the image is confined mainly to the crowns of the fibres. How can anyone claim that the bloodstains are underneath the image areas if they are indistinguishable from image, at least in a photograph?

As for what the Turin custodians might or might not have in their possession of comparable quality and value to researchers, one can only speculate. So I concentrate on what I KNOW is available, probably in a chest drawer of a fellow Brit, even if he is a dead ringer for Pope Benedict, as distinct from what might be behind lock and key in Turin or Vatican secret archives. I’ve occupied myself these last 10 minutes listing supposed features of the Shroud that need looking at again with HD images to hand (like how do “invisibly rewoven” regions with claimed end to end splicing of threads look like in an HD image, or the areas that have been stripped of their image with adhesive tape, leaving allegedly no underlying residue or damage, or the reverse side of the fabric, if available – is there really an image there or not? or the underside of the foot – is it really bloodstained? or the markings on the dorsal side that the Lirey badge maker interpreted as a chain, or the scourge marks – do they really have puckered margins?), or the reported lettering in Hebrew, Greek etc etc etc.). It is to my mind SCANDALOUS that these questions cannot be properly addressed for want of clear HIGH DEFINITION images that show image areas in close up in relation to weave pattern (the latter creating noise and possible artefacts in pre digital era imagery)..","date":"2012-06-09","mins":"6:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"},{"id":"comment-12107","author":"colin_berry","post":"Sorry – there was a word omitted:… but I for one fail to see how anything could be peeled off from those two “bloodstains”.

You should know better than ask a scientist to give proof. I don’t deal in proof, leaving that to mathematicians and logicians who start with axioms that are assumed to be unchallengeable. I start with hypotheses that are always challengeable, and then attempt to assemble evidence that supports a case. You are the one who should be put on the spot, claiming that complex processes of wear and tear cannot explain the image we see today. How can you possibly know that? Do you have eyes that can see events at the microscopic level happening over hundreds of years? In fact, the known structure and composition of flax fibres can account very readily for a highly superficial image AND mechanically weakened fibres, due to the way that hemicelluloses are distributed between primary and secondary cell walls. I’ll be setting out my arguments in some detail in my next posting, addressed primarily to MSM journalists, warning them against pseudo science being promoted as if unchallengeable axioms. The most glaring example is that fatuous and self serving claim that the ~200nm(?) thick Shroud image is too gossamer thin to have been formed using conventional energy sources. That is not just misinformation. It is a lot more serious than that. It is wilful and systematic disinformation,, backed up with virtually no hard information, and in any case contrary to basic physics, chemistry and botany. A 200nm thick image receptive primary cell wall is approx 50 times as thick as a cell membrane (~4nm) which is a lipid bilayer, approx two phospholipid molecules end to end. Since there are at typically 50 atoms from one side of the bilayer, then 50 bilayers is 50 atom x 50 atoms thick (i.e. 2500 atoms in all). I would expect a similar figure for the PCW, which makes it very substantial at the molecular level (it has to be, seeing the job it had to do before the SCW was formed, withstanding cell turgor and hydrostatic pressure). So why the instant dismissal almost everywhere in the Shroud literature of a 200nm image thickness?

I do not like being used as an Aunt Sally by true believers either here – or on other “single issue” sites which I happen upon in pursuing my SCIENTIFIC interests. So I shall simply say this: using Ehrllch’s reagent (diazotised sulphanilic acid) in the Van den Bergh reaction is OK if one is using it on fresh blood, where bilirubin, if present gives a purple colour. But adding it to a highly aged and degraded sample of dried blood and reporting a positive response simply “by eye”, without reporting or referring to any numerical /spectral /chromatographic data to characterise the chromophore as having come from bilirubin is frankly Mickey Mouse science. Had I been given the sample, I would have tried dissolving ii first, and then performing a Folch type lipid extraction with chloroform/methanol/water at approx neutral or slightly acidic p H, when I would expect bilirubin to partitiion into the lower organic phase. I would then have attempted to isolate the bilirubin, e.g. By thin layer chromatography, and then used GLC mass spectrometry of the volatile methyl or TMS derivatives, as described in my 1972 paper against similarly derivatised authentic bilirubin standards. As for the suggestion that bilirubin could contribute to an unusual red colour of dried blood, words fail me. Yes, bilirubin is orange, but its colour would be masked by haemoglobin in whole or dried blood. Yes, bilirubin levels in blood may be raised as a result of physical trauma, e.g. Heel strike injury causing mild haemolysis in runners, but the idea that an alleged elevated level of bilirubin (not proven, far less quantified) has anything to say about crucifixion trauma is frankly laughable. More Mickey Mouse science. As indicated earlier, bilirubin is prone to both bleaching and/or photooxidation on storage, exposure to light etc. There are numerous mechanisms involving photoisomerism, addition of singlet oxygen etc etc. Those who work with bilrubin on a regular basis avoid exposing it to light and oxygen. Goodness knows what gave a “positive” Ehrich’s test on Shroud blood, but I doubt strongly that it was bilirubin..","date":"2012-01-10","mins":"7:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/10/now-we-are-cooking-with-sciencebod/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Now we are cooking with Sciencebod"},{"id":"comment-191031","author":"colin_berry","post":".","date":"2015-02-14","mins":"8:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/14/on-deaf-ears-here/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"On Deaf Ears Here?"},{"id":"comment-191050","author":"colin_berry","post":".","date":"2015-02-14","mins":"2:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/14/on-deaf-ears-here/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"On Deaf Ears Here?"},{"id":"comment-191064","author":"colin_berry","post":".","date":"2015-02-14","mins":"5:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/14/on-deaf-ears-here/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"On Deaf Ears Here?"},{"id":"comment-9853","author":"colin_berry","post":"“Reducing colour developer temperature” Is it temperature you’re concerned about, Rene, sufficient to make you go looking for these more complicated, dare one say exotic alternatives?

In its original form, where heat was supplied by the fan heater on the back wall of the oven, I had to roast linen at a very high air temperature (180 200 degrees C) in order to get the flour imprint to turn brown. With revised Model 10, using the electric element (“grill”) in the top of the oven, the oven thermometer that records air temperature rarely rises above 80 degrees C while the imprint turns a dark golden brown. In other words, the flour is being ‘cooked’ directly by absorption of radiant infrared energy. The air, being largely transparent to infrared radiation, is scarcely heated at all. So Model 10 has joined the ranks of “radiation models”, but with a difference. A corpse is not required to become incandescent, scorching an image onto linen across air gaps – fanciful thinking if ever there was.

The important thing is to stay focused on key essentials, or we’ll all get swamped in detail. Might I suggest that the Shroud’s negative image is the key characteristic that makes it distinctive, and since most are agreed that no artist of a pre modern era would attempt to paint a negative, whether with sulphuric acid, lemon juice or gravy browning, then the most likely explanation is imprinting off a bas relief or other semi 3 D object. Was that done by applying some kind of pigment to a person’s face, obtaining an imprint then roasting, as per Garlaschelli, or was it obtained by direct thermal imprinting (“scorching”) off a bas relief replica, like a Plaster of Paris death mask say, either with impregnated or unimpregnated linen (pyrolysed coating or pyrolysed linen?). Speaking for myself, I like the idea of pyrolysis being the main source of colour, since that would leave no easy to spot at 100 yards artists’ or chemical pigments. But is it pyrolysed linen or pyrolysed additive or a combination of the two? The lemon juice system is a model if nothing else. Does a lemon juice image fluoresce? Is it reducible by diimide and decolorised? Does it strip off with adhesive tape more easily than a scorch on plain linen? Is it uniformly yellow, without “burned bits” (see Thibault’s new paper)?

I wasn’t aware I had shifted position since homing in on ‘shroudology’ back in December 2011. The target then, as now, was not religious belief or even relic/icon adulation. It was and still is a certain type of heavily media promoted, internet proselytized jargon laden pseudo science that serves merely to push an agenda. Nope, this biochemist’s beef is not with those who believe that the TS image was produced as a miraculous by product of Resurrection, not if they add the rider that scientists can never hope to reproduce or indeed explain it, even with recourse to counter intuitive quantum physics (where the distinction between physics and metaphysics becomes hopelessly blurred). If one believes in the Resurrection it is entirely reasonable that one sees the remarkable and indeed unique TS image as a side product, even a gift to mankind. Fanciful, romantic even, but all part of life’s rich tapestry. My beef is with those who employ (or as often as not, cynically deploy) the language of science, often with a token attempt at mimicking the methods of science (model building and testing). It’s an agenda driven exercise that has as its aim the promotion of some kind of belief system – political, ideological, theological etc – under the guise of rational objective science. It’s called pseudo science. There’s a simple test one can do to separate science from pseudo science. Look closely to see whether the investigators have acknowledged ALL the current scientific hypotheses and./or working models that are TESTABLE IN PRINCIPLE, and by that criterion alone can be considered legitimate subjects for inclusion in experimental design or interpretations. Or do they begin by immediately ruling out of contention certain scientific and entirely legitimate models for consideration, focusing their attention entirely on their own pet model. If so, one then looks closely at the latter. Is it really testable in principle, or so exceedingly difficult to test in practice as to make it virtually untestable in anyone’s present lifetime, at least with currently available technology. In short, is there real underlying science, or is it mere eye catching window dressing, designed to glaze the eyes, to lull folk into dropping their defences, and finally to abandon altogether their critical faculties, placing their trust in others who “seem to be so much better informed”? Folk who resort to pseudo science to push an agenda, especially those who like to bask in media limelight, are not just displaying one of the darker sides of human nature – a desire to influence others by deceit and trickery. They are damaging the image and reputation of science. In proper trustworthy hands, science offers a unique and powerful approach to addressing pressing problems that face us all, ranging from air pollution and climate change, to defence against bacterial and viral diseases to increasing obesity and premature death to ????? (others will have their own priorities) But good research risks being instantly discounted on the grounds that “those scientists just push their wild theories, wrapping it up in their incomprehensible jargon simply to fool us all”.

Put “shroud of turin” into your search engine and check the first 100 200 listings. See which ‘stories’ show the greatest staying power. Yes, shroudology is just the tip of the pseudo science iceberg, but that strikes me as good a reason as any for targeting it mercilessly. Expose its tricky little methods for all to see – making it harder for those who may be thinking of deploying the same dark arts to promote new agendas, disguised yet again as enlightened scientific opinion.

What proportion of the shroud would have required highly demanding, time consuming invisible mending? Probably not more than1 part in a 1000 at the most, would you agree if iit was not to take an eternity? Given that the shroud is 4.4 x 1.1 metres, that is 48,400 sq cm, so repairs were needed on just 48 sq cm. Yet the sample taken was a strip 7cm x 1 cm, i.e. 7sq cm. The chances of a strip of just 7sq cm having major repairs (especially at a corner) sufficent to throw carbon dating, when there are just 48sq cm of repaired areas scattered around a total area of fabric some 1000 times as great are minuscule. I shan’t try doing the probability calculation this time of night, and in any case I am rusty in that department.

I could tell you quite a lot about the latter, having spent two years researching the phototherapy of neonatal jaundice (my first published paper in 1972 as it happens). As for “three radiocarbon labs getting it wrong”, that is wilful misrepresentation of the facts.

When was the earliest herring bone weave shown in works of art, say from the Byzantine period, or did it make a late arrival, consistent with a late discovery? Irrespective, that weave must have been a boon to medieval artists wishing to distinguish between shroud and other patterned or unpatterned surfaces in a 1st century cave tomb, especially as they had the quaint(?) idea that Joseph of Arimathea purchased not only a probably anachronistic variety of linen, but a sarcophagus as well, requiring its (patterned?)lid to be propped up at an angle to see an “empty tomb”. Interestingly the Lirey badge shows both herring bone weave and what Ian Wilson interprets as the “empty tomb”, the latter again oddly sarcophagus like. Whether it has a lid on top or something else (grid? grill?) is another matter. The Lirey badge is arguably the key for unlocking the mystery of the Shroud if you ask me, made all the more interesting by the recent discovery of the Machy mould – showing there were at least two or perhaps more pilgrims’ badges commissioned, and that the “message” was being subtly altered with time. Fine tuning of the artwork? To what end?

Where the wrist is concerned, there is one possibility I mooted many moons ago. The metacarpal bones that are in the palm of the hand seem remarkably well imaged on the Shroud (thus the wacky “X ray story”, the ghost image of a hidden retracted thumb etc, with wacky medics going to Shroudie congresses after swallowing radioactive technetium to show fuzzy pictures of their internal organs). Regardless of why that should be so, i.e.the X ray look, it’s possible that the monk or whoever given the task of adding blood in all the right places mistook those metacarpals for finger bones (an easy enough thing to do). He then decided to play safe, and place the blood well below the metacarpals, thinking that would be the location of the palm. Before moving on to that second site – the back – perhaps I might ask you a question: if the Shroud image influenced early pre medieval art to the extent that so many claim, then why didn’t the wrist become quickly adopted as the standard site for showing the nail wound? “Illogical” trickle of blood? Take a look at the Lirey badge, and see how that trickle is represented as something that looks nothing like blood, unless highly stylized (with little if any evidence elsewhere ot any attempt to stylize). If it were meant to represent stylized blood, from the lance wound as Ian Wilson blithely assumes, then why does it extend from BOTH sides of the sheet, rather than just the side with the wound? What’s more that same configuration may have appeared on the frontal image too if the Forgeais drawing of 1865 is a reliable indication of how the badge appeared shortly after recovery from the Seine. There’s another entirely different explanation for the “blood belt” as Wilson describes it, one I’ve mooted before. It was originally the imprint of a chain, the latter being needed to secure someone to a stake before burning, as per Templars in 1314. It would have appeared on the Shroud as an image that was indistinguishable from body, if thermal imprinting (scorching) were the mechanism. Our medieval monk with his “blood” might have chosen to dab blood, or blood substitute, right on top of that “chain” motif, link by link, trying, not terribly successfully, to make it look even more like a complex blood trail. The rest as they say is history, or rather Ian Wilson’s rose tinted version thereof! (I was much intrigued by your suggestion on TOS that the loops represent two entirely different flows from the nail wounds in the hands, NOT the side wound. Whether right or wrong it at least shows you too have doubts that so complex a trail could have come from a side wound, although I see that Fanti et al tried to do so at an Ohio conference – shame about their highlighting of the side wound which they can see, but at least one other person cannot)..","date":"2013-03-05","mins":"11:22 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/03/02/shroudie-alert-day-12-time-now-to-write-that-long-overdue-letter-to-the-royal-society/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Shroudie-Alert: Day 12: time now to write that long-overdue letter to the Royal Society…"},{"id":"comment-2020","author":"colin_berry","post":"You may be surprised, or there again not, Matthias, to know that I too have pondered on the discrepancy between what we see on the Shroud, what we seem on the Lirey badge, and what we see on the “improved” drawing of the latter that Arthur Forgeais made in 1865. I don’t have any immediate answers – but it’s still near the top of my ‘To be pondered further’ list. The first priority in my view is to get independent corroboration of that ‘blood before image’ dogma. I’m 90% certain the image arrived before the blood, and it should be possible to find ways of scanning the Shroud to get at the answer (thinking of the techniques used to detect art forgery etc). What i find somewhat dispiritng Matthias is that in reading your comments above re that Pray Codex, it’s as if we have never had those previous discussions. I watched that BBC Rolfe documentary the other day, with M.Fleury Lemberg talkign so categorically about the “L shaped holes” on what she took to be the patterned Shroud, complete with herring bone weave. But for once it is I who has artistic convention on my side. That is not the Shroud with poker holes and herringbone weave. It is a (poorly executed) representation of the propped up lid of a sarcophagus. It is not a herring bone pattern, but squared off zig zag,. Possibly representing a mosaic. I say it is not the face cloth in a heap on that lid – but a token representation of a biblical shroud , with no attempt to represent a 4 metres length of up and over material, because the illustrator had not seen the Shroud, and was making no attempt to incorporate coded symbols. Had the latter been the case we would have seen some consistency in the 4 pictures – but there is none relating to the Shroud, certainly no attempt to flag it up as a cryptic influence in the design. But then who am I to comment on artistic convention? I just look for a degree of internal consistency when confronted with artefacts, and try not to look for hidden meanings – that being a road that leads to insanity unless there are independent reference points (shame there’s only one surviving Shroud!) That the Pray Codex is part of the authenticity promoting agenda – given credence by David Rolfe/BBC in that agenda driven commercial for Jackson’s Shroud Center – Rolfe’s and Jackson’s – is something that really gets me down. How can people be willing to scrape the barrel using some tiny, badly executed line drawings in an otherwise obscure and instantly forgettable manuscript? i have had to abandon many ‘brilliant insights’ in my scientific career, knowing that it is highly improbable that controversy would or could ever translate into established fact.

Well, i raise my hat to you Matthias for being able to make sense of the picture to which I think your refer. I see two quite separate lengths of fabric.

It is single length, albeit with some detail at the mid point that might be interpreted as a some kind of fold over point, but lacking the prerequisite of length. Then there’s the long narrow strip of what I presume is a ‘winding cloth’ that intertwines around the arms etc of the people in attendance. I really can’t see how anything in that picture can be construed as a representation of the Shroud, not even an approximate one. But as I say, I look for more substantial evidence, one way or the other, for authenticity. Hunting for clues in particular illustrations is simply not a valid exercise, at least in a statistical sense. You would presumably reject the radiocarbon dating on the grounds that one strip from a corner is perhaps not representative of the whole, so why imagine that one particular picture’s features are proof that at least one person had really laid eyes on the Shroud, and had wished the world to know that by incorporating “tell tale ” clues that are in fact given far too much over interpretation through modern eyes, given there are probably hundreds of similar depictions in manuscripts etc of the period. My focus is now mainly on what came first – blood or image. If the image arrived first, the Shroud’s bloodstains could not have been acquired via a narrative based on the New Testament.

The probability calculation would only be valid if the claimed design and apparent lettering had been clear enough to report before any numismatists were consulted. Once you say “Ah, this is the image of a coin” and then go looking, firstly for museum coins of the period, and then for their known markings by image tweaking, then it ceases to be an objective exercise suited to probability calculations. If one cannot be absolutely certain from the markings per se that the image is unequivocally that of a coin, lepton or otherwise, then one is into the kind of minefield territory where any arrangement of 52 cards in a pack can be claimed by a statistical amateur to represent “impossible odds”. But those impossible odds, calculated as 52 factorial, i.e. 1 in 52 x 51 x 50 ….. X 3 x 2 x1 are of course only relevant and valid if one has forecast the particular order in advance… It has to be a “genuine” prediction, based purely on the laws of chance. One is not allowed to import extra information that shortens the odds, i.e. “loads the dice” in common parlance! The key word is “tweaking”.

I can’t recall if we accepted his unsolicited offer to address the student body or not. But I do know one thing. Flat Earthers are far more keen to field questions than they are to pose them, because that’s what they revel in – showing they have an answer to each and every question you throw at them. There is a perverseness in their nature – they delight in denying and confounding… OK, now for a brief defence of my position, which I do not propose to labour. My first post on the Shroud was at the tail end of last year. Http://colinb sciencebuzz.blogspot.fr/2011/12/turin shroud could it have been.html It’s working hypothesis was that radiation at a distance HAD produced the image, but if it has been radiant heat and white light, then an opaque absorbing pigment was needed, for which I considered pencilled and/or painted on charcoal, and did in fact succeed in trapping enough radiation to produce a scorch on linen. But it was a positive, not negative image, which prompted further experimentation. Along the way I tried seeing if I could image the infrared rays from a hot metallic object (a metal pencil sharpener) onto cloth using a concave mirror, and almost idly, as an afterthought, stamped the linen directly with the hot template to produce a “brand” with a startling resemblance to the original, but for light/dark reversal, i.e. A pseudo NEGATIVE, just like the Shroud is a pseudo negative. My first thought was – surely not? – too obvious! Some two dozen posts later I am now wholly convinced that the Shroud image WAS produced by scorching, with a few remaining details to be resolved, like was it treated or untreated linen? Given the trial and error manner in which that current conclusion was arrived at, with no preconceived notions, and indeed an assumption initially that radiant energy was somehow involved, then I hope you will appreciate why your comparison between my approach – that of a retired science bod with an experimental bent and that of a Flat Earther could not be further from the truth. But I suspect you will have a ready answer to my plaintive protest. Indeed, I suspect it is you who will have a ready answer to anything I say in defence of my position, requiring little time and effort on your part, unlike the many weeks I have spent on this problem.

This is how our brain works: trying at all costs to make sense of what we see. On the contrary, the negative of the photograph of the Shroud picture naturally restores an image that is completely consistent with our everyday experience of a real human face. Our brain does not need to make sense of what we see: the meaning is immediate. It is a shame that I can not post pictures on your blog to show that. For now, I do not see that in the different images from your experiences. In other words, I do not see any negativity (in the sense of the image of the Shroud). It is possible that this is due to the small size of your models. Why not use a large model? Well, there’s one very obvious difference between the Shroud image, whether viewed the as is negative, or the Secondo Pia tone reversed positive. Both of them lack the ‘directionality’ of conventional photographic images. That’s easily explained, of course, by the fact that we usually see real things and people by the light they reflect, i.e. Their albedo, with the highest relief reflecting the most light, and, importantly, that the incident light that falls on the subject is invariably at a more or less oblique angle that creates shadows and thus the tonal contrast that allows us to perceive ‘3 D ness’. That is not the case where the TS image is concerned, so I’m at a bit of a loss to understand why you say that we perceive the as is image as that of a real person. I certainly don’t, but I don’t worry unduly about that, for the simple reason that I see that image in scientific terms as a contact imprint where’s there’s no possibility of tonal contrast. So why one may ask the remarkably human like look of the tone reversed image, where we would seem to concur? While it looks human like, everyone comments on a distinctive quality – the luminous soft focus serenity of the image (“Christ like” some might think). I would suggest there are two reasons for that. One is the removal of harshness when the tones are reversed, since the major topography of the initial topography is changed from predominantly dark to light, with the final denser tones having been promoted from what initially was white space. However, there’s another factor at work that moves us from the realms of science to psychology. If one takes an imprint by the method described here, one is getting a highly symmetrical capture of the topography around the vertical long axis of the subject, since the technique cannot discriminate between left and right as is the case with unilateral illumination in photography. I suspect it’s that bilateral symmetry that makes the TS image, the tone reversed one especially, so unusual, dare one say subtly captivating..","date":"2016-01-07","mins":"10:21 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/07/who-says-science-cant-explain-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"latest_research,","title":"Who says science can’t explain the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-6700","author":"colin_berry","post":"OK.

But how long does one have in which to carefully apply the blood in all the biblically correct locations? If somebody had asked me that a half hour ago, I’d have said 15 20 minutes. Oops, not so, at least with simple flour/water imprinting medium. Paint it onto one’s fingers, and it’s well on the way to becoming bone dry (and thus useless for imprinting) within 5 minutes. There’s nothing like an experiment to destroy one’s preconceptions. Body temperature with accelerated evaporation of water are presumably the explanation. Of course, a cold corpse or even effigy could have been used as subject, in which case the evaporation would have been slower, but it’s nicer to think that a willing volunteer (live) had been used. So while flour/water is OK in principle as an imprinting medium if all one wants is a body image, it’s not suitable if intending to add the bloodstains as well carefully and precisely over, let’s say, a 15 to 30 minute time scale at least.
