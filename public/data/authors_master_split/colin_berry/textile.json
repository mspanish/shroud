You as a historian might be interested in what I’ve just this minute found on a site called http://www.historian.net: FACT: The shroud is a herringbone twill with a 3:1 weave, of probably 1st century Syrian design. The flax fibrils contain entwisted cotton fibrils from a previous work of the loom. The cotton is Gossypium herbaceum, a Middle Eastern species not found in Europe. (Raes, G.: La Sindone, 1976; Tyrer, J. Textile Horizons, Dec, 1981) How can the writer be so certain that the cotton is carry over from previous weaving, especially as cotton fibrils are “entwisted”? Would the latter not suggest that there was co spinning of flax and cotton fibres with the deliberate intention of producing a blend? Oh, and am I not right in thinking that just because the cotton is not indigenous to Europe does not mean that it could not have been imported from Egypt, say, in the cotton boom period of medieval France? Irrespective: why all the song and dance right now about cotton in the radiocarbon sample when it seems clear from above that cotton has long been recognized as a component of the Shroud’s weave (whether there as a contaminant or purposeful addition)?.","date":"2013-10-22","mins":"3:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"id":"comment-48449","author":"colin_berry","post":"“As far as I know Hugh you have never conducted experiments or eaxaminations of Shroud fibers.

If so, maybe we need more information about your publications and other scientific accomplishments. Since yousdenigrate the work of Rogers, Brown and Villarreal is that such an unreasonable request?Their credentials are a matter of public record.” One always hesitate – or should – before criticizing the published work of a particular scientist, regardless of whether one considers his credentials superior to one’s own or not. But if the work is published, then its merits and demerits are exposed for all to see, and no one should feel in the least bit inhibited from proffering criticisms, merely because some people are perceived by lay observers as being so elevated in the scientific pecking order as to be beyond criticism. That’s why we have publications – not edicts. Scientific research is a collegiate exercise – performed in the open (inasmuch as conference proceedings etc are usually publicized). It’s not something conducted in smoke filled backrooms, with mafia godfathers calling the shots, or at any rate shouldn’t be. The internet offers an opportunity for everyone to participate in the argument. What matters ultimately is not who people are re academic qualifications and background, but what useful points they have to make. Hugh Farey is high on my list of people who have useful points to make – but then he’s a old school science bod, someone who latches onto the detail (it often being the detail that is crucial to establishing the facts). Rogers was a proactive chemist, prepared to try new untested methodology, which was good. But he should have discussed and shared his findings with more of his peers before going to press. It’s understandable why he felt under time pressure, given the medical circumstances, but no one should feel inhibited from criticizing his findings and conclusions. He was a human being with human failings – same as the rest of us. His work needs to be approached with caution and a keen critical eye. You see, Raymond Rogers had his blind spots.

It has first to be shown that is is anomalous! I can’t speak for NY courts of law, but that’s how science operates (onus or burden of proof etc).

Time and again one finds it is the presence or absence of proper controls that distinguishes genuine science from inferior imitations. So much for the basic principles and MO of science. As for the practice, no one should underestimate the difficulty of instituting proper controls for quantifying the amounts and distribution of cotton contamination, given we are dealing at the level of individual fibres, not whole threads (there being typically 200 or more fibres per thread that would each have to be examined to check whether they were cotton or flax).

I’ve been deceived by the color of the puppet which is dark. You should try with a more human like doll. No offence, but why get hung up on “positive” versus “negative”? That only became a talking point post Secondo Pia, and the startling results of his doing a negative back to positive tone reversal (phrased in modern post photography jargon). But I doubt whether the first viewers of the Shroud were at all puzzled by what today we call a negative, or given to lengthy speculation as to how that image was formed. They would simply have recognized it instantly as some kind of “imprint” left by pressing a solid object, correction, person into linen. It would have seemed no more mysterious than a muddy footprint on a clean white floor. It may have taken them a little longer to figure out the nature of the imprinting medium, but blood would have supplied a clue. They would have arrived finally at one answer only – bodily sweat! What about the back of the linum? There is a a faint reverse side coloration on my current linen imprinting. It varies from one experiment to another and it’s tricky to pin down the precise reasons why, there being so many variables to consider. I suspect it’s to do with the distance that a hot brown LIQUID cocktail of Maillard products/melanoidins migrates into the fibres via capillary movement between the fibres. However, it’s probably not worth spending too much time to that aspect until I get some herringbone weave linen instead of the plain 1:1 I’ve been using thus far. The 3:1 weave of herringbone allows for a longer migration on the contact side before the thread runs through to the opposite non contact side of the fabric. Is the imprint only on superficial layers of the fibers like in the Turin shroud? Certainly it’s a relatively few fibres in each thread that are coloured. That much I know by teasing out a single imprinted thread with its 200 of so fibres under the microscope. Teasing out destroys the initial geometry of course, but it seems reasonable to assume that few coloured fibres equates to highly superficial coloration at thread level, though not necessarily at fibre level. It’s a tricky area, and one that has not been properly addressed by other researchers in my view. Before finding your post here I had the idea that maybe the shroud is the result of a chemical process caused by the scented oils they used on corpes in ancient times. The possible combination with special conditions inside the burial place could have triggered this particular reaction, similar to your experiment (there are many examples of weird things happened inside tombs due to particular chemical reactions). Maybe the shroud is not a false, maybe it’s just a singular object. I’m pretty sure that your results can be obtained experimenting with some resin’s oil (myrrh or something similar) and dust (produced by stones?). You’re entitled of course to hold your pro authenticity view. For my part I rejected it years ago on two chief grounds. The first is the radiocarbon data which while unsatisfactory from a statistical sampling standpoint seems to me more likely to be closer to 1260 1390 than 1200 1500 years earlier. The second is the small detail as regards the iconic double head to head body image. It never appeared until the Lirey pilgrim’s badge in the same ‘radiocarbon’ ballpark, namely the 1350s. The earlier so called sightings of the Shroud are never of a two fold body image that folk quickly interpret as a frontal/dorsal imprint on an up and over sheet of linen. Taken with the too good to be true bloodstains, scourge marks included, I regard a 14th century provenance the default position, and am frankly astonished at the number of folk, yourself included, who still hold to a different view. I think this is a more realistic hypothesis than the fraud idea because if a technique like this was known in the middle ages we would have found traces of it in art for sure. But it’s not about art, or at any rate mainstream art. It’s about a top secret forgery (expressed crudely) that had to be a customized one off. Any loose talk would have resulted in loss of months, probably years of patient development and testing of the simple but entirely novel imprinting technology. But we know that people like Leonardo or Michelangelo had to use physical models in order to paint the human body in a realistic way. I mean: the use of this technique for artistic purposes It would guarantee more gains than a shroud almost unknown to the vast majority of people. Why are you bringing “painting” into the discussion. The Shroud body image is not painted: nobody can be expected to paint in those negative reversed tones, even if deliberately intending to imitate the appearance of an imprint, and do it so well as to result centuries later in the spectacular effects of tone restoration by Secondo Pia. The Shroud body image is/was clearly perceived as a body IMPRINT, so why is it so unreasonable to go one step further – provided one accepts a medieval date of manufacture – and assume that if intended to be seen as an imprint it was decided to was produce it by imprinting (as distinct from free hand painting). Is imprinting any more difficult in principle than painting? Is it not simpler, requiring no artistic skill, just attention to technical detail. What was difficult was finding an imprinting medium that simulated ancient sweat. I say they found the answer in their kitchen larders – white flour and vegetable oil, with the thermal processing equipment nearby – a bread baking oven. By the way I think the chemical reaction hypothesis is the more realistic. Have you done any hands on experimentation to determine what is “realistic” and what isn’t? I have – 5 years worth no less and my current flour imprinting model is the 10th model to be examined in detail! I consider it simple and realistic. Anyone with an hour or two to spare can test it out for themselves in their own home. All they need, as stated, is white flour, vegetable oil, linen and a hot oven, not forgetting plain old soap and water for the final rinse. Thanks for your interest.

Thibault Heimburger MD then came in and said the images obtained with flour slurry were too sharp, not fuzzy enough. That was the signal to switch to dry powdered flour onto wet linen (current Model 10). I’m now thinking there were alternative ways of creating a fuzzy image. I might at some stage revert back to a modified Model 9, especially as there are those who dogmatically maintain the face is too angular to be imprinted.

If you look at the first of the graphics labelled “variegated patterns,” you can certainly see horizontal banding very clearly, but it is seen mainly where it crosses the image zones, and is scarcely visible outside those zones. Now Rogers talks about bleaching and impurities, and how impurities reinforce the image intensity, but is not very clear, at least in the quoted passage as regards precise mechanisms. Where the latter is concerned it gets somewhat confused, because there are so many impurities listed by Rogers – lignin, which can be bleached or unbleached, conjectural starch (“impurity coating”), saponins etc. What makes his exposition ever more opaque, at least to those of us trained in chemistry and botany, is his inclusion of “hemicelluloses” in impurities.Hemicelluloses, with a significant content of pentosans, 5 carbon sugars, are intrinsic to plant cell walls, and are a major component of the primary cell wall (PCW). There is in fact a much simpler explanation for banding than the one proposed by Rogers. It is based on that PCW, a discrete botanical entity that Rogers scarcely mentioned, if at all. The PCW is highly superficial – in other words it is the first layer of cells that one encounters when approaching a flax or linen fibre from outside. That’s because it is the first formed layer of cells in flax and other plants, and remains on the outside when the secondary cell wall is later added. All we have to do is to suppose that it is the highly superficial and chemically reactive hemicelluloses of the PCW that were the prime target for image imprinting on the Shroud, producing yellow or tan dehydrated carbohydrates and their condensation products. Secondly, the more adherent the PCW, i.e. Through having resisted flaking off in spinning and weaving, then the more intense the image. So any process, whether mechanical or chemical (as in bleaching) that strips off or reacts with hemicelluloses will lead to a lighter coloured thread, a light band in the final weave, and less intense image. Conversely, any threads in which the PCW is more intact and chemically unbleached will tend to produce a darker band, especially in the image zones where that surviving PCW and its hemicelluloses have acquired colour by whatever process caused the image. Raymond Rogers was a gifted chemist, but sadly he seemed to have had a blind spot for the PCW. My own botany was limited to A Level and fresher year at University, which partly explains why I’ve been having difficulty finding estimates for the precise thickness of the typical plant PCW, but nothing I’ve seen so far would rule out PCW thinness as the reason for the Shroud image layer being a mere 200nm thick or less (as suggested) if the image is formed solely on the outside facing PCW. Remember – the linen fibre comprises elongated single cells. (Yes they look thicker in the parent flax, but that’s because the fibres are cemented together in bundles with pectins. Retting is about degrading the pectins, with the aid of bacteria, to liberate the individual fibres that are then reassembled into threads by spinning, but are still independent fibres comprising strings of single cells). Many moons ago I showed that one could form an intense contact scorch on the stripped epidermis from dried onion scale leaves – the latter a gossamer thin flake also just one cell thick, presumably with a PCW that is 200nm thick or thereabouts. Don’t be deceived by superficiality. Highly superficial layers can make excellent surfaces for image capture and colour production. Who needs to invoke starch or other impurity layers when there is a receptive PCW, more in some parts than others, accounting for that banding and those differences in image intensity.

That hunch is reinforced when one sees the entire argument being used to dismiss a medieval provenance for the Shroud. Some might think that speculation as to the reasons for the gaunt face is futile unless one knows the mechanism of image imprinting. A point worth noting is that gauntness, in the sense of being narrower than one might expect, is a characteristic that is not restricted to the face. One sees it in the forearms too, one of which looks particularly stick like, and in the fingers, giving rise to their description of “bony” with some even suggesting an X ray type of imaging. Personally I think there is a very obvious explanation for all the gauntness effects, and it has little if anything to do with bleaching or banding, and everything to do with the mechanism of imprinting. But the posting is not about that, so I’ll stop here..","date":"2013-10-20","mins":"2:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/19/todays-how-do-we-know-banding-patterns-and-what-they-might-mean/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Today’s How do we know?

One could imagine differential bleaching having some effect on the appearance and banding of fabric when freshly made, before or after image imprinting (though why uv light/fluorescence are needed to show it up best is another unexplained aspect). But why should it affect appearance now, centuries later, after oxidation and yellowing have reversed any initial bleaching reactions? It all seems suspiciously like a carefully crafted spin doctored narrative to me, designed to make the the radiocarbon dating look oh so historically and technologically naive and untutored. But C 14 dating is concerned purely with the history of C 14 atoms, and their 100% predictable decay curve, and the relevant technology is that of counting the ratio of C 14 to C 12 atoms. What happens to those shanks of thread and bolts of linen cloth now or in past centuries is irrelevant, except for contamination issues which are hardly ignored and where possible tailor made to the material under test. What we see with the bleaching/banding story might be viewed uncharitably as the creation of an urban myth, but it’s been done in so neat, plausible and mellifluous a manner that “urbane myth” might be a kinder description. Yup, neat, plausible but WRONG..","date":"2013-10-21","mins":"5:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/19/todays-how-do-we-know-banding-patterns-and-what-they-might-mean/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Today’s How do we know?
