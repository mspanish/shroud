[{"id":"comment-56762","author":"alphaomegapoint","post":"Hi, Dan Porter. For the details on how physicist and mathematician Prof. Frank J. Tipler’s Omega Point cosmology precisely matches the cosmology described in the New Testament, see my following article: James Redford, “The Physics of God and the Quantum Gravity Theory of Everything”, Social Science Research Network (SSRN), Sept. 10, 2012 (orig. Pub. Dec. 19, 2011), 186 pp., doi:10.2139/ssrn.1974708. Http://archive.org/details/The Physics Of God And The Quantum Gravity Theory Of Everything Additionally, in the below resource are six sections which contain very informative videos of Prof. Tipler explaining the Omega Point cosmology, which is a proof (i.e., mathematical theorem) of God’s existence per the known laws of physics (viz., the Second Law of Thermodynamics, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics), and the Feynman De Witt Weinberg quantum gravity/Standard Model Theory of Everything (TOE), which is also required by the known laws of physics. The seventh section therein contains an audio interview of Tipler. I also provide some helpful notes and commentary for some of these videos. James Redford, “Video of Profs.
