The shroud is a mysterious part of the film and for me serves as symbolism inside a most original story… and one America should take notice of. To me, it’s a movie with a message of hope through anti violence. Cloning Jesus initially hit me in a scientific sense, and the film plays with that… but after seeing it, I think there’s a more potent meaning behind the idea of cloning… and that’s to ‘act like him, or be like him’… Clone Jesus. Jewish Hollywood would never support this type of thing. It’s impressive that it’s even out there. Critics are for people who don’t want to think for themselves..","date":"2013-02-26","mins":"7:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/26/more-on-that-movie-oh-and-also-the-shroud-of-turin-has-been-stolen-from-the-vatican/","cat":"art","title":"More on that movie: Oh, and also, the Shroud of Turin has been stolen from the Vatican"}]
