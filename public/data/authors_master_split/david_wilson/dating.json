[{"id":"comment-2254","author":"david_wilson","post":"Prof. Jull has told Prof. Fantie that they received two pieces from Turin, one larger and one smaller. Call them L and S. That’s not news. Everybody knows that. But the revelation that Arizona cut L into three pieces and only used two of the pieces L1 and L2 for C14 and saved the third piece L3 is a shocking revelation. So where is L3 and where is S and which is the piece that Prof. Jull kept in his office. Does Prof Fantie know???? Talk about chain of evidence and accountability.
