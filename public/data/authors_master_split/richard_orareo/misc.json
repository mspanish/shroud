[{"id":"comment-44004","author":"richard_orareo","post":"Hey Dan, Sorry to say the web site is a work in progress just as the museum is a work in progress. We have not had a formal opening as yet; but it is nearly ready. The interior restoration is complete and the exterior is just starting. To be worked on. I expect completion will be a month or so away. We had a tornado touch down in the neighborhood; and lost about 15 trees, the clean up is also nearing completion. As close as we are, we are not there yet. I will let you know, Richard.","date":"2013-09-12","mins":"9:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/12/the-wabash-shroud-of-turin-museum/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Wabash Shroud of TurinÂ Museum"}]
