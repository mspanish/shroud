[{"id":"comment-50436","author":"richard_orareo","post":"I just happen upon Barrie’s interview on EWTN right at the beginning. It was a great interview with just the right amount of humor and a perfect mix of up to date status as well as a reflection of his personal, hands on experience of being on the scene. I tried to call in during the whole hour, but couldn’t connect. Ray Downing phoned in and made it! Perfect job Barrie, Richard Orareo.","date":"2013-11-08","mins":"11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/barrie-on-ewtn-liveand-again-in-repeats/","cat":"event","title":"Barrie on EWTN, Live–and again in repeats"}]
