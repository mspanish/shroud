[{"id":"comment-193097","author":"dave_hines","post":"Good Evening Daveb of Wellington, The Message Behind The Shroud is one of hope and possibility. One that sheds light where there is darkness, hope where there is despair, faith where there is doubt and joy where there is sadness. Those are all things Jesus did during his ministry and Russ Breault is doing the same. Good, that is exactly what the Lord wants done. Shroud is a witnessing tool. I am 100% convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud. For 3 Reasons 1. The Forensic Science tells a story of a scourging, mocking, crucification, death & resurrection 2. Scripture tells the same story and the forensic evidence is in agreement with scripture 3. Personally confirmed to be authentic to me by The Spirit of God The 3rd being the most convincing. Back to messages, I think there is a message written plainly on the Shroud, an identification mark/message telling us all exactly who the Man In The Shroud is. Before I say what this is, I have this question for you Daveb of Wellington If you were a forensic detective and came upon the scene of a very brutal murder in which the victim was stabbed 120 times and you came upon this man lying face up and saw what clearly looked like the number 3 written in blood on the right side of that person’s head, would you think it looked out of place? Would you photograph it? Would you measure the blood stain? Would it get your attention & leave you thinking that it was left by the killer, a signature sign? Or would you think by random coincidence the blood coming from a small puncture wound just happened to take on the shape of number 3? The odds of that happening are extremely slim. I challenge anyone in the world to show me a photo of a blood stain that by random coincidence took on the shape of #3. “I am from Missouri you gotta show me something!” Since The Shroud case file is loaded with “coincidences” that all point to the same historical figure as being the Man IN The Shroud I thought I would humor you and add some more bizarre coincidences/messages for you to look at. Messages Behind The Shroud 30 Coincidences Relating to #3 blood stain on Shroud which is “coincidentally” 3cm in length 1. Jesus prayed (3) three times in the Garden of Gethsemane before His arrest. 2. Jesus was placed on the cross at the 3rd hour of the day (9 a.m.) 3. There were 3 hours of darkness that covered the land while Jesus was on the cross from the 6th hour to the 9th hour. (On the cross for 3 hours) 4. NASA confirmed there was a blood moon in Jerusalem on Friday April 3, 33 AD, (This just happened to be the time of the Passover that year) 5. Jonah was in the belly of the whale for 3 days 6. After Elijah was taken into heaven skeptical roman soldiers searched for his body for 3 days but did not find him, only his Shroud/Mantle was left behind. (Preceding Event to the Resurrection) 7. Jesus’ ministry on earth was 3 years and he was 33 years old at death 8. Jesus is 1) Prophet, 2) Priest, and 3) King. 9. There were 3 witnesses to transfiguration of Jesus, John, Peter and James 10. During His ministry Jesus raised 3 people from the dead. 12. There were 3 crosses, 3 people crucified 13. The inscription on the cross of Jesus was in 3 languages. (Showed completeness of His rejection by man) 13. Peter denied Jesus 3 times, 14. Later Peter told Jesus he loved him 3 times 15. Judas betrays Jesus for 30 pieces of silver 16… 3 Samples of Shroud fabric are sent to 3 different labs 17. Shroud of Turin is 3 over 1 herringbone twill fabric 18. 3 women and 3 men were present at burial. 19. Jesus appeared to his disciples 3 times after being resurrected 20. 3 witnesses to Resurrection, Shroud, Sudarium, Empty Tomb It took Saint Joseph and Mary 3 days/3 nights to find Jesus in the Temple; Talking with the elders for 3 days 21. Jesus received 3 gifts at birth, gold, frankincense & myrrh (same at death) 22. Jesus was in the tomb 3 days 23… Jesus said he would rise after 3 days & temple will be re built in 3 days 24. God’s attributes are (3) omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence. 25. God’s essence is that of a Trinity (3) Three in One: Father, Son, and Spirit. 26. Three (3) denotes divine perfection and completeness 27. Jesus died at the 9th hour (3 p.m.). 28. The Number (3) is the number of resurrection 29 The NUMBER 3 IS WRITTEN IN BLOOD ON RIGHT SIDE OF MAN IN SHROUD! 30.. The NUMBER 3 BLOOD STAIN IS 3 CM LONG!!! Are you serious?! Of course these are all just coincidences they have nothing to do with the #3 bloodstain. That is another thing that just happened by random coincidence, like the distance information. That is not distance information, just incredible luck, some fibers are colored and others are not, some lite, some dark. There was no planning involved. #3 bloodstain was not planned either. 9 More Points To Consider Before Dismissing the Number 3 of having significance 1. The Physical Universe consists of 3 things: 1) Time, 2) Space, and 3) Matter 2. Time is divided in 3 different parts: 1) Past, 2) Present, and 3) Future 3. Space is 3 dimensional: 1) Length, 2) Width, and 3) Height 4. Matter coexists in 3 states: 1) Solid, 2) Liquid, and 3) Gas 5. People consist of 3 distinct parts: 1) Body, 2) Soul, and 3) Spirit. 6. Water consists of 3 elements: 2 Hydrogen and 1 Oxygen 7. There is 3 D Information on The Shroud of Turin 8. ELF Waves Around Earth are made up of 3 components. A. The Electrostatic Component B. The E Wave Component C. The Magnetic Component A sophisticated form of wireless communication Spirit of God uses to communicate with 1.plants, 2.animals and 3.people 9. Shroud Fabric is 3 over 1 Herringbone twill fabric, reference to The Shroud in the Bible is 3: 1 Galatians. “You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell? Was not Jesus the Messiah clearly portrayed before your very eyes as having been crucified?” (Further Coincidence: There are pollens on the Shroud from Central Turkey where Galatia was) Final “3” Coincidences written in book of Revelation An angel is charged to cry 3 woe’s to those who live on earth to warn them of more trials to come (Revelation 8:13). The murdered bodies of the Two Witnesses will not be allowed to be buried but rather will lie openly in Jerusalem for 3 days before they are resurrected. 3 unclean spirits will be allowed to deceive the whole world to FIGHT the returning Jesus Christ in what is called the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 16:13 – 16). The new Jerusalem, created by God for placement on a new earth, will be shaped like a square with 3 gates on each side (Revelation 21:13). # 3 is written in blood on the right side of The Man In The Shroud who is bringing a message of hope and possibility. One that sheds light where there is darkness, hope where there is despair, faith where there is doubt and joy where there is sadness” “Who do you say that I am?”.","date":"2015-03-11","mins":"2:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/nice-review-of-russ-breaults-presentation-in-wisconsin/","cat":"article","title":"Nice Review of Russ Breault’s Presentation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"comment-193165","author":"dave_hines","post":"Opinions vary.","date":"2015-03-11","mins":"10:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/09/nice-review-of-russ-breaults-presentation-in-wisconsin/","cat":"article","title":"Nice Review of Russ Breault’s Presentation in Wisconsin"},{"id":"comment-196023","author":"dave_hines","post":"I did get a chance to hear Barrie, I listened to the entire broadcast.

He is a English Gematria calculator. His numbers add up correctly. He states The Shroud of Turin and the Image of Edessa are one in the same and it’s not a painting. The testimony of my witness is compelling, subtle and powerful, Gematria is an Assyro Babylonian system of numerology later adopted by Jews that assigns numerical value to a word or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or bear some relation to the number itself 1.Behold The Image of Edessa= 1128 2. It’s not a painting= 1128 3. It’s The Mandylion = 1128 4.Shroud of Turin = 1128 5.Jesus of Nazareth = 1128 6. The Shroud of The Lord =1128 7. Risen Lord Jesus = 1128 8. Shroud Is Genuine = 1128 9.

A little bit of reverse on the numbers and letters still adds up to the same thing. Coincidence? No Way. 11:28 PHRASES 11:28 John “The Teacher is here and is calling for You” 11:28 Mathew “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” 11:28 Luke “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it” I challenge anybody in the world to type in the name of a famous person, place or thing on a English Gematria Calculator and then find 33 other phrases and or words that relate to that person, place or thing and they will all have the same number?!

I can put this into a question as in one would see in a IQ Test (I know you are a highly intelligent person, I am not doing this in a mocking manner) Which of the following does not fit with the rest of the group? a. Jesus of Nazareth b. Shroud of Turin c. Shroud of the Lord d. Useless exercise e. Son of God 3 D Hologram There are things on The Shroud of Turin unrelated to the distance information but in pointing those out does that mean the distance information on the Shroud is not genuine? In the body of “info” on the Shroud there are water stains. In pointing that out does that mean the distance information is not genuine? There are 2 possibilities All the phrases and words relating to Jesus and The Shroud that equal 1128 are coincidental. All the phrases and words relating to Jesus and The Shroud that equal 1128 are not coincidental. There is a purpose and Higher Power intelligence involved or there is not. There is no in between. Yes or No. Question: What is genuine information? To be genuine information the following criteria must be met. 1. Statistic (Signal, # of Symbols) 2. Syntax (Set of Symbols) 3.Semantics (Meaning) 4.Pragmatic (Action) (When Shroud is placed under VP 8 analyzer the “info takes action”) 5. Apobetic (Purpose) Question: Is the distance info/3 D info on the Shroud genuine info or not? Note that it passes all 5 tests to be genuine, not random. Higher Power intelligence involved. To conclude otherwise is not logical. My Gematria English Calculator has another purpose as well. One of those is to bring attention to this subject. What is genuine and what is not? What is coincidence and what is not? Are all the match points between the Sudarium and Shroud also a series of incredible coincidences? My question: At one point does one stop and conclude “These cannot all be coincidences”! These are all variables one must compute on their own and then at some point, hopefully make a decision. “which means to cut off from any other possibility” To continue in doubt and uncertainty for a prolonged time is unhealthy. . The 2 emotions blend, Doubt and Uncertainty blend and create Fear. The underlying cause of all all illness, both physical and mental. A disease is defined “as something that causes the abnormal function of the mind and body” To be in doubt and uncertainty for a prolonged period will cause one to become ill. Making a decision and taking bold action can eliminate that doubt and uncertainty thus eradicating fear out of your life, the normal function of the mind and body is one of the benefits from making such a bold and courageous move. Is fear a counselor or a jailor? An ally or enemy? If it is the latter there is a problem Sorry to get sidetracked, I am sure you get the point. Thanks for responding Dan.

If it was my goal to create reasonable doubt on the other side. I would take a famous person, such as Tiger Woods for example which equals 810 or another name, place or thing that adds up closer to 1128. And then find 12 words or phrases associated with that person, place or thing that also equals 810 Example: Tiger Woods= 810 Hole in One= A golf pro= Or it could be a famous singer Elvis Presley = 1002 Don’t be Cruel = ? Bottom Line: Should be easy to debunk. If one can find 12 things that make sense and fit in with that person and equal the same number in the minds of a jury it would likely create reasonable doubt. They would be thinking “this works with anything” “This is not a message left behind by the Spirit of God” “It’s coincidental” “that lawyer is trying to trick me into believing the Shroud is genuine” These are other things in Gematria that are also noteworthy to mention. The name of Jesus for example = 888 in 3 languages. Hebrew, Greek and English More 888 Combos (there are more I did not include to save time and space) A Message From God 888 Jesus Messiah 888 The Lion of Judah 888 Jesus The King 888 He is the Messiah 888 He was Scourged 888 Mocked and Crucified 888 He is a crucified Man 888 Laid in a Garden tomb 888 A clean linen cloth 888 Burial Shroud 888 Eternal Kingdom 888 Saved In Jesus 888 Here are some 666 Combos (there are more I did not include to save time and space) 1. Mark of Beast=666 2. Witchcraft=666 3. Insanity=666 4. Slaughter=666 5. Corrupt=666 6. Necromancy=666 7. Demonic Evil=666 8.Image of Satan=666 9.Forehead Sign=666 10.Satan’s Seal=666 11. Demon Inside=666 12. Satan’s Hell=666 13. The Eden Snake=666 Gematria has been around for thousands of years. The English language has only been around for 550 years. Therefore the following results in Gematria could not have been fixed or set up by human intelligence. It is either a coincidence that’s a statistical monstrosity or a message from a higher source. Unlike other modern languages, the English language is the world’s language, to which all others must comply in order to conduct business in the modern world. If a Higher Power wanted to reach the largest amount of people with a message, the English language would be the one he would use to leave messages behind. It is of my belief that is exactly what was done. Many centuries ago. On a closing note I want to make it clear I am not posting things like this with the goal of “proving someone wrong” or out of spitefulness. I do not want anyone feeling uncomfortable or bad in any way. Quite the opposite. I want people feeling good. Having success in their lives. Feeling free and happy. That includes every body. Skeptic or not. Everyone deserves a chance to have a happy, successful and purposeful life. It is of my belief that can be achieved by one turning their life and will over the care of the Man in The Shroud/Jesus. To give him a chance before rejecting him as a folklore story. No one wants to come to the end of their life with a “What If?” “What might have been had I given God a chance in my life” That said. May The Holy Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding Rest upon you, A spirit of power and love eternal. Amen.","date":"2015-08-03","mins":"5:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/29/barrie-schwortz-on-catholic-radion-indy/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"Barrie Schwortz on Catholic Radio Indy"},{"id":"comment-207354","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Hugh: I do believe in coincidence and random good luck. That is based on years of research. Yes, one could falsely perceive a Higher Power/God is involved in something when in fact it is not. A single random event or even a few repeating themselves does not add up being to a miracle/message or as being genuine information. In the same way a single letter or 2 does not make a word. But when a event repeats itself over and over again is where it gets the attention of a forensic detective, as in 7 or more coincidences that point to the same suspect. In such cases what were initially called “coincidences” turned out not be coincidence. Recall that I wrote “I challenge anybody in the world to type in the name of a famous person, place or thing on a English Gematria Calculator and then find 33 other phrases and or words that relate to that person, place or thing and they will all have the same number?!” Where are the other 32 phrases or words that relate to Demon Mind Control that equal 1128? Where are the other 32 phrases or words that relate to Satanic Bloodline that equal 1128? Where are the other 32 phrases or words that relate to Alien Infiltration that equal 1128? Those are random events, single letters that do make a complete word or message. . Pieces of a puzzle that do not make a complete picture. To make it easier try and find only 12 other words or phrases under, Demon Mind Control or Alien Infiltration that equal 1128. And they must have an obvious direct connection. Such as Shroud of Turin= 1128 Jesus of Nazareth = 1128 A Picture of Jesus= 1128 The Shroud of the Lord=1128 A Sacred Winding Sheet=1128 Son of God 3 D Hologram=1128 Named Jesus Christ=1128 There is no grey area there. They fit together, like pieces of puzzle that are obviously connected and go together with ease. Satanic Bloodline and Demon Mind Control are related. Good. Where are the other 31 phrases or words that relate to it? That is only 2 pieces of a puzzle, 2 letters that do not make a complete word or message. Random events without meaning. To be genuine information the following criteria must be met. 1. Statistic (Signal, # of Symbols) 2. Syntax (Set of Symbols) 3.Semantics (Meaning) 4.Pragmatic (Action) (When Shroud is placed under VP 8 analyzer the “info takes action”) 5. Apobetic (Purpose) What you listed does not meet this criteria. What I listed is much closer to meeting the criteria for genuine information, The acid test to know if there is a outside intelligence at work or not is this, Does the “info” pass all 5 tests? If so we can then a make a clear distinction between what is random or not random. Coincidence or not. There are still missing pieces of the puzzle that I have not listed. It is not yet a complete picture. On a side note, the distance/3 D info on Shroud meets/passes all 5 of the requirements to be genuine information. Not a random letters and meaningless symbols that do make a complete message. Look at the list. Shroud passes all 5. Extremely noteworthy. Your skills at math are way above average. You should be able to debunk what I wrote here as not being genuine information with fair ease if is coincidental and random. But it will take more than just presenting a few random events to do so. And while doing so, make sure to have some fun doing it! Enjoy the journey.

You have a very imaginative unique writing style, with a touch of humor as well. The only thing I am actually selling and promoting is my vacation rental property. I have some guests coming this week and a ill person I have to attend to so I have to make this response a bit short. We do not promote any of our videos, on rare occasion they are shared as the one shared on this this site. But that does not increase views being here. People come by attraction not promotion. If we wanted bigger numbers, we could go that route, but we prefer not too. We are against door to door knocking and telemarketing type things. Very much against that. The Gematria display is a take it or leave it type presentation. I don’t believe there is anything magical about Gematria. Just letters and numbers. We try not to get to hung up on any single display. You mentioned a “mind control fraternity” I am not exactly sure who that would be in reference too, but on our channel we are not interested in controlling anyone or recruiting anyone. We sell nothing. We do not ask a person to part with any of their hard earned money. To do so would be against the will of God. At least for me, I can’t speak for anyone else. We do not have a Church or Ministry or anything like that. We ask only that people acknowledge the good works of the Lord Jesus. The Shroud being a witnessing tool only. Let the Spirit of God take over after that. Who is also not controlling or domineering but flexible and open minded. That is based on my personal experience. There are a lot of sick people in the world Mr. Collins doing very unholy and sick things. Claiming to represent the Lord yet they do not represent him. Launching attacks against people like you mentioned, I believe you called it a serial browbeater. Just so you know not everyone is like that. In the same way one who is skeptic/sceptic cannot be stereotyped as being            It is flat out not true. Or one who is pro authenticity for the Shroud is not a. We are all unique individuals with different life paths to follow. Different destinies. A time and a purpose for everything under Heaven. On a closing positive note you are least doing experiments and making a visual presentation with how you believe The Shroud image was formed. Not many are doing that. We live in a visual age. People want to see things. Let them see everything. Let them see both sides. Like I said in the beginning, there is a sick person I have to attend too that requires my attention. I have to go. Perhaps we will cross paths again in the future sometime. Peace.

France? I’ve reached a point in my research where I feel absolutely compelled to be be able to present what I am saying about The Shroud in a visual sense, a genuine demonstrated reality. In the same way if I was a Big Foot Researcher I would want to present a high quality video of Big Foot, up close and personal right live on camera. “Here it is” One that would leave absolutely no doubt “This thing really does exist” Get a blood sample as well and bring it to a lab. If I was a UFO researcher I would want a actual spacecraft on the ground with aliens getting out of the craft, on video. Close up shots and with a high quality camera. Live on video, Full HD, with sound. If I was trying to prove a demon exists I want one on camera or film an exorcism with a body levitating and objects flying around the room. One the huge challenges in Shroud research is that at some point in the research it requires having an actual dead body to wrap in pure linen herringbone weave fabric and attempt to recreate the scenario that went down in 1st Century and with the appropriate spices. As crazy as that may sound that is what is needed. A genuine dead body and start experiments. A good relationship with the City Coroner would be helpful. That is one of the reasons I am here in Central America. I brought all my gear with me. A lot of paranormal equipment. Night vision cameras, EVP Voice Recorders, Electro Magnetic Field Sensor, Ect. There is a Sanitarium here that also used to be max security prison I want to go see soon. Supposedly one of the most haunted places in the world Some of the testimony and photos I saw warrants going to the location and filming. All night long if need be. Anyways, I am wishing you success in your Shroud research. Many of the things you are saying make sense to me. See if you can purchase all the spices you need. Pure linen fabric of herringbone weave is available on line. Many of the things you need are available on E Bay. The spices and the fabric.

Very difficult. This process involves having a more powerful laser than what I have. Barrie did mention also the Shroud has never been reproduced, Many centuries ago The Image of Edessa was “the image not made by human hands” “The Shroud of Turin” is also…….. “the image that cannot be made with human hands” A very obvious connection, A coincidence? I think not. At the end of the day after all is said and done The Shroud remains “the image that cannot be made with human hands” And long after we are both gone and have left this world, The Shroud will still be the only image in the world we cannot replicate.or fully explain. (unless the Spirit of God grants one the wisdom, understanding and insight into how it was) Who knows? that person could be you, maybe even tonight. All things are possible. If the Image of Edessa was just some painting on linen there would be historical record of it. No one would have looked at it and said “Wow there is an image not made by human hands!” There must have something about that image that was absolutely stunning, something no one had ever seen before. Something amazing…like The Shroud..","date":"2015-08-01","mins":"2:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/29/barrie-schwortz-on-catholic-radion-indy/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"Barrie Schwortz on Catholic Radio Indy"},{"id":"comment-207287","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Yannick: i know you are really good researcher, highly intelligent, a man of good moral character. I apologize in any way if my post comes across negatively argumentative or overly aggressive. I don’t want anyone feeling bad, or disrespected in any way. I believe The Shroud was replicated in many ways by many people throughout the centuries. Hundreds and thousands of different types of imitations, In the same way in this day and age any thing considered great is immediately.imitated/replicated. Be that a song, piece of art, a movie, clothing, a new car, toy or game, add infinitum to the list,. Great things are imitated. In most cases if not all, the original thing has to exist 1st before there can be a imitation. Where is the original role model? It looks very obvious to me. However, Until new evidence is forthcoming and I am able to present in a visual sense new evidence that supports the authenticity of the Shroud I am not going to be posting in regards to the Shroud on this Blog, with perhaps some rare exception, the exception being if The Spirit of God compels me to, and it is in accordance with his will. I am not carrying out my own personal agenda. I seek God’s will with diligence and 100% commitment. Over 7 years now. My work to date is the result of that commitment. I’ve made some mistakes and made some overstatements in some of my presentations. But we learn by doings things and taking action. I know what needs to be done. And for that to accomplished I need to take a step back, A Shroud of Turin break. Spend more time in prayer and much less on internet. Good luck with all your future research..","date":"2015-08-02","mins":"5:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/29/barrie-schwortz-on-catholic-radion-indy/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"Barrie Schwortz on Catholic Radio Indy"},{"id":"comment-211487","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hi Matthew L: You wrote “Bart Ehrman: I’m afraid there is little doubt that it is a medieval forgery” Let’s think about that statement for a second, If so that would mean that when the Shroud was exhibited in Lirey France in appx, 1350, they were displaying a relatively brand new fabric and attempting to pass it off as being nearly 1,300 years old. This would be not unlike exhibiting a 2014 auto at a antique classic car auction and saying “look at my antique car” “It’s 100 years old” “it was driven by Charles Chaplin in 1914” “who wants to buy it?” There is actually little doubt that it is a medieval forgery, No doubt in my mind what so ever (for whatever that is worth which is not much) That is actually also a quote from Dr. Frederick Zugibe chief medical examiner of Rockland County New York in regards to whether or not he believed a genuine dead body made contact with the Shroud, which he did believe the linen made contact with a genuine human man and said, quote, “I have no doubt in my mind what so ever” That does carry weight. His yes was yes and his no was no. Convinced. Not lingering in doubt and uncertainty. He made a decision, decision comes from a word that means “to cut off from any other possibility” The Latin meaning of the word decision literally means, “to cut off.” Making a decision is about “cutting off” choices – cutting you off from some other course of action. Now that may sound a little severe and limiting, but it’s not. It’s liberating (as long as it is a decision not made in haste) The Shroud being a medieval forgery would also mean The Savoy family was involved with something they knew was not genuine, as in a man made fabricated image and faced with the task of attempting to pass off a 100 year old fabric as being 1,400 years old?! “I hope we don’t have any textile experts coming to today’s Shroud exhibition, if so we could be in big trouble if the word gets out we are really a group of deceiving liars” “Is there any way you can make that cloth look older?” “Don’t let anyone get to close to it, I would like to stay in my position as the King of Italy” I agree people are sometimes/often gullible, but not that stupid, “Excuse me Sir, you can’t be serious about this cloth, it means it looks like it was made last week” It would have destroyed their credibility as leaders of Italy if they were displaying what looked like a relatively new fabric they were informing people was 1,400 years old. They would have been the laughing stock of Italy and not remained in power very long if they were involved in this kind of deception involving Jesus and the cloth he was buried in. I cannot in my wildest imagination picture the Savoy Family purchasing The Shroud without conducting a thorough investigation into it’s history and closely examining the linen before doing so. Interesting to note everything I have seen in their collection of relics are all genuine things, no reproductions of any kind, fakes or forgeries. Shroud of Turin was in their collection. If we applied the same “impossible to reach standards” to all things in which authenticity was at question, as is being done with the Shroud nothing would ever be authenticated. We would all forever be in doubt and uncertainty. Lingering in the middle. I cannot imagine anything more utterly painful (with some exceptions) than not being able to make a decision and stuck in that grey twilight of uncertainty for all my life. Jesus said, “Let your Yes be Yes and let your No be No, anything other than this shows something is wrong and comes from the Evil One” My Yes is Yes and my No is No. Yes, The Shroud is authentic, and No, it is not a medieval forgery. Lingering in doubt and uncertainty for a extended period of time in not healthy. It creates fear within your body The way to eliminate the fear is to make a decision. “To cut off from any other possibility” Dr. Frederick Zugibe made that decision, a forensic pathologist. In a court of law authenticity type setting, that would be the testimony that would carry the heaviest weight, second to none and greatly aid one in making “A decision” Take a good look at all the possibilities before cutting off from them. Good luck..","date":"2015-09-29","mins":"7:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/22/recent-interview-with-russ-breault/","cat":"video","title":"Recent Interview with Russ Breault"}]
