If I had more finance I would use a genuine corpse with the 14′.3″ of fabric. The problem is they don’t make pure linen cloth with herringbone weave that is wide enough. Another problem would be costs. The myrrh resin alone would cost over $1,000. High grade myrrh is expensive. After my house is sold I will have more finance and I will do it again with a real body and someone to assist me with the wrapping that knows how this is done exactly. I posted some recent photos of the blood. One thing I noted is that the sample with myrrh and aloes covering the blood leaves a clear coating over the fabric, it feels not unlike as if there is a thin layer of super glue is over the fabric. On the sample with the myrrh resin only it surprisingly does not have this effect Not much change to the feel of the fabric. The combo of myrrh and aloes leaves a very thin clear layer residue over the fabric. Blood has not changed that much over the last 70 hours. Some fading.View post on imgur.com.","date":"2015-05-26","mins":"9:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines"},{"id":"comment-201287","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hi Charles, if myrrh and aloes made contact with the the hair of the Man in The Shroud, it would stiffen and harden as a result.

Thanks for the links you posted. Very interesting. You are probably right in that the Shroud was more loosely wrapped. This was a bit of tight wrap. I’ll do it again a 2nd time, more loosely wrapped. I unwrapped the figures after 3 days. They became linen myrrh and aloe statues. The links you posted made for fascinating reading. I have never seen them before. I’ve heard of “the cloth was flat at the time of the image” but was never convinced or sure of that. That has always been a unknown to me. Just thinking out loud here tonight and writing it down as it comes, On a LCD Screen (Liquid Crystal Display) prolonged display of non moving images can create a permanent ghost like image of these objects. To me, The Shroud Image is like that. Human DNA is made up of liquid crystal, a gel like substance. DNA emits a weak laser like light in the UV Range, a few billion photons per second. What would happen if that process was amplified? Perhaps The Shroud image is made up of the liquid crystal DNA of the Man in Shroud. A permanent ghost like image on linen instead of a LCD Screen..","date":"2015-06-08","mins":"1:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines"},{"id":"comment-200360","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hi Dcn Andy: Bar a miracle from the Spirit of God I will not be able to produce a image that matches the chemistry and physics of the Shroud. No way. I will only be able to explain a part of it. Not all of it. At best be able to match a few of it’s qualities, not all. There is only one particular aspect of the Shroud image I am aiming to reproduce. So far I have already seen what I was hoping to see. The micro thin clear layer of sugars left behind on the fabric by the myrrh and aloes. People can disagree with Ray Rogers and rip into him all they want, but the fact remains his work was published in a scientifically peer reviewed journal. He says there is micro thin layer of starch fractions and pectin on the Shroud. I think he is right. . If he did not have very convincing evidence of that he would never have written a scientific paper stating so. He would make a very credible witness in a court of law. An imprint of myrrh and aloes is not going to cause accelerated aging of the fabric. It is something completely different I am proposing. The photos are interesting. If one was to paint these they could be sold on Ebay Linen Statues. The problem is the cost of myrrh resin. It’s expensive. Blood stays red on the pure linen.

I saw the painting with the fingers in the shape of the reverse 3. Where do you come up with this stuff? Great find. Anyways I have something I would like you to think about and consider before responding back. Take your time. Could be days, weeks or months. I really want you to think about it/pray about it before responding. There is no urgency. When I say it, I think you will disagree, but I would like for you to at least consider this possibility and do your best to gain the deepest possible empathy with Nicodemus and picture yourself in his position knowing the events that occurred on the day Jesus/Yeshua was scourged and crucified. BOTH?! Think about the scenario as if YOU are Nicodemus and what you would do, You are rich and in a high enough position.to where you were likely present when Jesus was scourged. I would also like you to look into how wounds were treated in this time, often done with sugars. Myrrh and aloes contain multiple sugars. Here is my theory The Myrrh and Aloes mentioned in the Gospel of John were not purchased for a burial but to treat scourge wounds on a LIVING Jesus not a dead one. For whatever this is worth, The Spirit of God confirmed with me I am right on this. That is of course here say evidence and holds ZERO weight. Think about this. Nicodemus may have been present at the scourging or at the very least knew that the scourging took place and was extremely brutal. His thinking at that time must have been, “THAT WILL BE HIS PUNISHMENT. IT’S OVER” So he purchases the myrrh and aloes to treat the scourge wounds, to prevent them from getting infected. Full well knowing multiple applications would be necessary over a period of weeks to prevent infection, and purchases the excessive amount. Full body applications would be necessary over many weeks if proper healing was to occur. Myrrh resin was used in war to cover battle wounds. It is a antiseptic. Man In The Shroud had a lot of “battle wounds” Myrrh and aloes are more of the kind of thing you would use on a living person, not a dead one. To crucify a person after nearly brutally scourging a person to death is extremely abnormal. . This is very out of order. Nicodemus did not anticipate Jesus being crucified after, to be punished TWICE. Scourged and Crucified!? The myrrh and aloes ends up being used in the burial, But was not originally intended that way. Something to think/pray about it. The starch fractions and pectin on The Shroud. I believe that is the remnant of the myrrh and aloes applied to Jesus and cloth. A liquid form, not a ground up in a powder. Mostly water weight. I also believe the image resides in that thin layer. As Ray Rodgers believed. “But it does not matter what I believe, only what I can prove” Working on it..","date":"2015-06-20","mins":"11:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines"},{"id":"comment-201417","author":"dave_hines","post":"Hello Max. I will have to purchase some aloes wood. I will attempt different burial wrapping methods in the near future, using a shotgun approach. 7 to 12 different ways. One of them has got to be right. Note. Max how the pure linen fabric “SHINES” in the video. And becomes a “A Large Shining Wrap” Hebrew sovev mawr = “large shining wrap The spelling of this noun, φαιλόνην implies these adjectives 1. Wide/Long 2. Upper (As in upper position such as a high priest) 3. L Ight bringing and light giving (something that shines) I included some of your high light quotes in this regard. 1.“Reminder: The Greek word phelonen/phailonen, “large shining wrap” (2 Th 4: 13) is to read in the light of the TS body image as the latter when seen under a certain angle and light, looks like translucid straw yellow impression. This is consistent with the use of flashing gold mosaic tiles to feature the Christ’s pallium in the Pudenziana apse mosaic.” 2. Reminder: the pallium is the Roman evolved form of the Greek himation, a word used in conjunction with the Image of Edessa 3.Actually BOTH Greek and Hebrew (the latter as his mother tongue) could have been natural to Shaul/Paulus. Paulus had Mark as his amenuensis so he could have used him. 4.In Hebrew sovev mawr = “large shining wrap” 5.In the Second letter of Timothy there are many words and phrases that do NOT exist in natural Greek. The non natural Greek word phailonen “naturally” translates Hebrew sovev mawr. 6.Reminder: the old French word Graal plays on/can be derived from the Hebrew phrase Gar El, “G.od dwells/shines (in it)” 7.Now the Greek Word φαιλόνην (phailonen) is derived from the ancient Greek word phao, “to shine”, “give light” (e.g. A heavenly light such as surrounds angels when they appear on earth) or “make manifest”.Thus philologically speaking, the word phailonen most accurately denotes “a very large wrap that shines The Wrap In This Video “Shines” Just another coincidence. 1.Image of Edessa was known as “the image not made my human hands” 2.Shroud of Turin is known as “image that cannot be made with human hands” 3. Coincidence? I don’t think so. Closing note: Max you really should have a book written documenting everything you know about the Shroud. If not, all your research and knowledge could be forever lost when you leave this world. I think it is important you have a book written.

This would no doubt help preserve the fabric and the blood stains. Myrrh resin is not unlike tree sap. This clear thin coating however is surprisingly not present on the fabric with myrrh resin only? (at least not to the same degree as the #3) The #3 sample fabric is hardened and smooth where the myrrh and aloes were applied, but not present with myrrh resin only. Very little change to the feel of the fabric other than darkening to some degree. I believe the thin layer of starch fractions and pectin that Ray Rodgers identified on the Shroud is the remnant of the myrrh and aloes put over the body of Jesus almost 2000 years ago. My theory at this time only. Cellulose acetate is used to coat holographic film plates. Myrrh and aloes together have a very similar chemical make up. What the catalyst would be to create a chemical reaction to make cellulose acetate is the thing I am not sure of. Possibly sulfuric acid in the sweat of Jesus,. However there are many different acids in myrrh resin any of which could be a catalyst that could convert myrrh and aloes into cellulose acetate. I a jumping way ahead of myself, blood stains 1st. We now know blood will stay red on pure linen fabric after 72 hours. Covered in myrrh and aloes would it stay red up to 2000 years?

Think of it this way. To start, the artist uses a genuine human being wrapped in myrrh and aloes. Now he knows where to draw lines exactly. Now he can add to the image using whatever medium he wants and the anatomy will be 100% correct. Does not have to imagine the rights and lefts reversed and attempt to do that without making error. It is already done. It would be the equivalent of using tracing paper to do a work. Anyone can do that. View post on imgur.com I hope I did this right. This is just a few photos. I will flatten out the cloth later so it can be seen that way. I did not want to return the initial 3 D effect. I am sure you are familiar with the 6th Century writing. “Peter ran with John to the tomb and saw the recent imprints of the dead and risen man lying on the linens” I believe one of these photos in here captures what John saw that made him believe Jesus had risen and the body had not been removed from the tomb by the Roman soldiers as Mary Magdalene had initially thought.

I just have not flattened the cloth out yet. I did not want to ruin my linen statues. One of the main purposes of doing this was to find out if a 3 D figure could be replicated with linen covered in myrrh and aloes. To make a “3 D linen statue” I did not know if a watered down version of myrrh resin would be enough to make a 3 D linen mold. Last time I did this I used 70 to 80% myrrh and less aloes. It is always said, “the color on Shroud fibers is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen” How would myrrh and aloes coming in contact with linen accelerate the aging process of the linen? Answer: It would not. Like I said I am not proposing a contact image of myrrh and aloes being responsible for the image. I am more interested in the clear thin coating it leaves behind on the fabric which would contain 1. Glucose (A reducing sugar) 2. Galactose (A reducing sugar) 3. Xylose ( A reducing sugar) 4. Arabinose 5. Rhamnose 6. Gluceronic Acid Something that does cause accelerated aging is UV Light. We all know what happens when we get to much sun, the result is an accelerated aging of the skin. I believe the thin coating of myrrh and aloes on the Shroud came in contact with UV Light. Ray Rogers believes the image is within the micro thin coating and not on the fabric. Any thoughts on that? My final question is how would paint applied to the fabric cause accelerated aging of the linen fibers? We all know what happens when a defendant goes into court and his or her alternative theory explanation does not match the forensic evidence. It does not end well for the defendant. I am not going to try and change your mind on the paint theory. I fully understand how locked in you are into thinking that. Anyways, Blood on pure linen will stay red for several days, perhaps several months, and even 100’s of years if a protective covering of myrrh and aloes is applied to it..","date":"2015-05-27","mins":"1:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/26/fascinating-video-from-dave-hines/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Fascinating Video from Dave Hines"}]
