The AB negative type is so extremely rare that there’s a high probability Michelle’s family is related to Mary’s family somehow. Especially since they are also Jewish, and narrowing it down even further: Michelle’s family are Levites as Mary was. And, because Michelle donated bone marrow for her brother, he now has female chromosomes because bone marrow is what MAKES our blood cells. So it’s Michelle’s bone marrow that is now making her brother’s blood for him. That’s why he has female AB blood instead of male AB blood. She’s right, this is a good joke on him. Very interesting, thanks for the explanation.I wonder if Michelle’s brother is starting to show any female traits ; ) F3.","date":"2011-07-26","mins":"8:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"}]
