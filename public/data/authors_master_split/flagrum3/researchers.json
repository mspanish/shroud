[{"author":"flagrum3","post":"There is one point that de Wesslow makes that I find nonsensicle...Especially from one who claims to be an Art historian...He states that 1st century Jews would not be accustomed too 'visual' stimulations, hense the reasoning for thier interpretation of the Shroud image as being a 'risen' messiah..Hog Wash! The Romans had been in Palestine for almost a century and were huge on 'images' such as frescos, statues, paintings etc, etc;...A first century jew would then be quite used to images and to suppose they took an image as 'proof' is rediculous. I'd bet at first notice they probably just thought the impression was a secretion of sweat and blood, nothing else (as many others have in the past). Then also to assume hundreds of people were also fooled or dillusional enough to believe an image on a Shroud is the 'raised messiah' is just plain lunacy.F3.","date":"2012-04-01","mins":"11:55 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/03/my-comments-on-telegraph-article-about.html","title":"\nMy comments on a Telegraph article about Thomas de Wesselow's claim that the Shroud is authentic but Jesus was not resurrected #1\n"}]
