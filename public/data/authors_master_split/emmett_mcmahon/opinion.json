[{"id":"comment-213483","author":"emmett_mcmahon","post":"I have a terrible idea that may help to resolve two problems. Problem #1 is the Shroud of Turin the actual burial cloth of Jesus Christ, Problem #2 How did the artist of the Prince of Peace (Akiane Kramarik) know how Jesus Christ looked. I have read that folks who have examined the photo image of the Shroud and weighed it against the image of the Prince of Peace have that it is about 85% accurate on all the comparable points. How can that be ? Get a few Federal criminologists, preferably non Christian or Atheists and give them a series a questions to ask Akiane about her knowledge of the actual appearance of or what Jesus really looks like. I had read that she denies ever seeing the Shroud image before her so called dream(s). In other words a series of Polygraph tests, Of course you will have to pay her. Then we have the problem with how the 12th century forgers knew ahead of time what Akiane’s painting would look like. Maybe Akiane is one of the old forgers reincarnated. That would have to be one of the questions to ask her. This has to be one of the dumbest things I have ever written..","date":"2015-10-24","mins":"2:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/24/and-now-you-have-something-to-do-this-weekend/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"And now you have something to do this weekend"},{"id":"comment-171184","author":"emmett_mcmahon","post":"I am not one who could even imagine how anyone could argues against that point unless they are a a true die hard atheist.

Sometime back – not sure of the month, day or even the year. I had read about the Shroud and my remembrance is that on the 3rd day after Christ was placed into the tomb, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb to try and anoint the body of Jesus with spices. Instead of finding Roman guards at a sealed tomb, she found the guards gone and the tomb opening was open as the large rock had been rolled to the side of the opening. She entered the tomb and found that the area where the body of Christ was supposed to be was empty of the body. She was confounded and ran back to the room(s) where the Apostles were and reported the fact of the missing body too them. A couple of the Apostles and the Disciple Mary Magdalene returned to the grave and observed the fact that there was no body. My problem is that I don’t recall whether Mary took the Burial Shroud with her from her 1st visit or it was picked up by one of the Apostles upon their entrance of the tomb to investigate. The Apostles and close Disciples kept tight control of the Shroud and it was passed on to their followers for many centuries. The Shroud has the remnants of the blood, sweat and dirt that was left on it from the burial and also the metaphysical image of the body that was created and remains from the exact time that the physical body was energized by the spiritual soul of our Lord at the time of his resurrection..","date":"2014-11-15","mins":"6:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"id":"comment-171481","author":"emmett_mcmahon","post":"Thank you, especially for the site of the USCCB..","date":"2014-11-15","mins":"9:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"id":"comment-46316","author":"emmett_mcmahon","post":"Yes, I have been convinced for several months.

I have tried to follow what some of the other people have said but my knowledge in this field in just about nil. The image body intensity, as I follow it, was caused by the Holy Soul of our lord when he reentered the physical body just before his Resurrection. That is why his eyes are closed. I don’t follow the coins over the eyes. I firmly believe that this is Christ’s Shroud. A few months back when I was looking at some of the original photos of the shroud and then observed the “cleaned up” photo made after the 3 D imagery was included – the image I saw caused a jolt in me, it kind of said “Yes, I am Lord Jesus”. Or something to that affect – it was a short statement in my mind..","date":"2013-10-07","mins":"7:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture"}]
