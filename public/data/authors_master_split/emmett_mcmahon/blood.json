[{"id":"comment-38838","author":"emmett_mcmahon","post":"We may not know for certain all that was done to the human body of Christ after he was removed from the cross but before being placed into burial. We can assume that because of the people’s feelings for Christ that he was treated with love and reverence. Thusly we can assume that he was treated gingerly and cleaned to make him presentable. The body would have placed – back down onto the lower halve of the burial shroud and then the upper halve of the shroud would have been gently put onto the full frontal (face up) body. Evidence shows that a strip was removed from the side of the shroud and used to wrap around a portion of the enclosed body to secure the full shroud around the body.

When Christ arose from the dead, he left the crypt that he was laid in. When he did this the rock was moved from the opening. If I was on guard there I surely would have made note of that fact. I wonder if the Romans kept any of those records? ..","date":"2013-07-10","mins":"7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/10/erase-the-fact-from-the-list-it-is-not-a-fact-it-never-will-be/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Erase the fact from the list.
