I’ve been deceived by the color of the puppet which is dark. You should try with a more human like doll. What about the back of the linum? Is the imprint only on superficial layers of the fibers like in the Turin shroud? Before finding your post here I had the idea that maybe the shroud is the result of a chemical process caused by the scented oils they used on corpes in ancient times. The possible combination with special conditions inside the burial place could have triggered this particular reaction, similar to your experiment (there are many examples of weird things happened inside tombs due to particular chemical reactions). Maybe the shroud is not a false, maybe it’s just a singular object. I’m pretty sure that your results can be obtained experimenting with some resin’s oil (myrrh or something similar) and dust (produced by stones?). I think this is a more realistic hypothesis than the fraud idea because if a technique like this was known in the middle ages we would have found traces of it in art for sure. But we know that people like Leonardo or Michelangelo had to use physical models in order to paint the human body in a realistic way. I mean: the use of this technique for artistic purposes It would guarantee more gains than a shroud almost unknown to the vast majority of people. By the way I think the chemical reaction hypothesis is the more realistic..","date":"2017-02-26","mins":"2:23 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/shroud-scope-10-my-very-own-gallery-of-20-close-up-views-of-the-shroud-all-lightly-photo-edited-for-optimised-colour-differentiation-25/","cat":"brightness","title":"Shroud Scope 10:  my very own gallery of 20 close-up views of the Shroud – all lightly photo-edited for optimised colour-differentiation"}]
