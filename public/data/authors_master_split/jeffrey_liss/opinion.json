[{"id":"comment-53871","author":"jeffrey_liss","post":"Short version: I don’t agree with Stephen Jones; ‘icon’ here is an intentionally ambiguous term. Parsing statements that emanate from the Vatican is an art form in itself. I certainly don’t have the insight or experience to interpret papal statements generally, but I think what we have here is an example of Francis employing a generalized term to avoid making a pronouncement on authenticity. A philosophical definition of ‘icon’ would seem to support this, at least according to the OED: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78391/icon OED.png I suspect Francis is using the word ‘icon’ because it encompasses both artifacts and acheiropoieta. Again, I suggest consulting someone with more experience at this; Fr. John Zuhlsdorf comes immediately to mind: http://wdtprs.com/blog/. I can say, though, that popes often employ this type of semantic legerdemain as a foil against their every utterance being immediately taken as interpretations of Catholic dogma..","date":"2013-11-29","mins":"10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/29/a-point-of-view/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"A Point of View"},{"id":"comment-65980","author":"jeffrey_liss","post":"How much humility was there in the way the radiocarbon results were announced in 1989?.","date":"2013-12-23","mins":"5:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam"},{"id":"comment-204051","author":"jeffrey_liss","post":"Yes, relic vs. Artifact is a distinction that matters. Ultimately, though, that comes down to belief. The ‘most studied’ part is true in the sense that it has been examined, pondered, sought after, etc. For (the evidence suggests) nearly two thousand years. In another sense, though, it’s not even close to the top of the things examined by science pile (let’s assume for the moment that such a thing exists) simply because of a lack of access. All of which makes sense given its fragility and the stakes involved but would still exclude it from the upper echelons of examined…thingies. Until, perhaps, reliable and accepted non destructive methods are available..","date":"2015-06-29","mins":"8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/is-the-shroud-really-the-most-studied-whatever-in-history/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Is the Shroud Really the Most Studied Whatever in History?"},{"id":"comment-204061","author":"jeffrey_liss","post":"Curious you left out my parenthetical.
