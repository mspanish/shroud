They can be generalized as a plea: Pay as much attention to the technology and information model used to identify, preserve, and share scientific data as you do on the methods of collection and analysis. The goal here is to structure information such that it can readily be understood and reused by others. Much of the web today consists of ‘mashups’ made possible through open AP Is. This enables others to combine and recombine content from multiple sources to deliver new information, adapt existing information to a new purpose, or discover relationships between previously disparate sources. In other words, it powers everything from serendipitous discovery to cutting edge computer aided research, but it can only exist when openness and sharing are prioritized rather than grudgingly conceded. Any future investigative project should carefully consider and implement the following: 1. Transparency. We live in an age of digital rights management, copyright wars, and efforts to control what can exist and persist on the Internet. Any future investigation should commit to the release of all images, video, data, analysis, etc. Gathered. In fact, there is no technological impediment to streaming all collection activities to a global audience in real time. After the fact, data should be similarly public from a single Internet repository. While I have great respect for scientists, the work they do, and the publishing process, the Shroud belongs to the world. So should the data. Wherever possible, authors should request that their published materials be publically available, rather than secreted behind paywalls. For some publishers, this will be a deviation from preference or procedure; again, the Shroud is different. 2. Data structure: Wherever possible, identify and structure information according to accepted international standards — not just in terms of file formats, but semantics as well. For example, the Open Provenance Model (http://openprovenance.org/) provides a framework for explicitly identifying and tracing the nature and sources of scientific data. Bio Portal (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/) is a searchable repository of ontologies for the life sciences. Semantically structured data is vital for fruitful communication and collaboration, especially between different communities of interest or scientific specializations. 3. Public involvement: While the very thought will rankle some, there needs to be a way for non professionals to be involved in the preparation, planning, execution, and analysis. The fact is that important contributions have been made by non professionals or by scientists working in “home laboratories.” It is far better to encourage — but also formalize — those contributions than to summarily exclude them. An example implementation might work something like Reddit. Allow members of the public to comment or make suggestions, and use a system of weighted comment promotion as a traceable, rigorous way to move information collectively identified as valuable from a comment all the way to the attention of the scientific team. Other priorities need to be stressed, but with these three implemented (as well as the existing methods of getting people’s attention such as SHOUTING and comboxes) others will advocate for them more effectively than I..","date":"2013-11-14","mins":"1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/14/colin-berry-is-writing-to-the-vatican/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry is Writing to the Vatican"}]
