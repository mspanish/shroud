I could no longer stand on my feet, I fell to my knees, and I can’t tell the story without crying, even now. I saw an advertisement in a Christian magazine with this picture, but knew nothing of the book or story. I cut the picture out and put it on the refrigerator, and told my family that this is the closest replication of the Jesus that I met. One month later, I was given the book for Christmas and when I got to the story of Colton trying to find a picture of Jesus, and then saw the picture, I started to cry. Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Christ, all agree that this is a very accurate depiction of Him..","date":"2012-01-16","mins":"8:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
