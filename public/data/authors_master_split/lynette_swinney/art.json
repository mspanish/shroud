Have you read “90 minutes in Heaven” by Don Piper? I was so in awe of his story and I could feel his passion and the intensity of the desire he had to describe Heaven; How our human minds just can’t comprehend or feel or find words to describe heaven!!!! I encourage you to read his book and I want to encourage you to tell your story to all who will hear. I would love to hear it in detail myself. If I never meet you or hear from you again on this side of Heaven, I will see you there!!! What a day that will be.!! Glory Hallelujah. Praise His Name; my Savior and Lord; JESUS CHRIST..","date":"2011-09-13","mins":"9:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-3850","author":"lynette_swinney","post":"Annie Cee, that makes sense.
