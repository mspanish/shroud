Everyone i have shared the story with gets shivers….If they didn’t believe in Christ that wouldn’t happen. I just wrote a book called The anointing Of Mercy and everyone that has read it said they felt the anointing while reading it too. When God is present there is no faking it.the world who denied him will be shocked to see Jesus is for real. I have had to many experiences with God to know without a shadow of doubt…God is almighty the great i am “why does the world try so hard to hide God and everything he has done. Thats the real question for These non believers. The book is the best and praise God for Akianes photos i love all of them thank you so much may this book and painting be put into hands and computers with lightning speed till the whole world has a chance to see it amen.","date":"2011-04-12","mins":"1:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]
