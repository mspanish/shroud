Also if was folded to allow for practical protective storage then that might have been done in the overall best protective interest of the shroud. The L shaped holes might have been left for a number of reasons, including that they were attributed some symbolic significance, or were considered too close to the image to repair without affecting the image.","date":"2013-06-19","mins":"9:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/18/shroud-of-turin-talk-in-gilroy-california/","cat":"event","title":"Shroud of Turin Talk in Gilroy, California"},{"id":"comment-48831","author":"matthias","post":"That’s a great pub Colin, I had a pint there in April..","date":"2013-10-26","mins":"6:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/26/some-thoughts-on-the-st-louis-conference-announcement/","cat":"event","title":"Some thoughts on the St. Louis conference announcement"},{"id":"comment-26376","author":"matthias","post":"I don’t see any problem in Yannick’s analogy, I thought it was a good one – both cases have pseudo science trying to reinforce a particular belief system. Of course there is an almighty difference in the ‘end’ if not the ‘means’. Obviously the Nazi example was for sinister ends, the Shroud example is not for sinister ends at all. Misguided ends, potentially, but not sinister..","date":"2013-03-04","mins":"6:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/the-face-jesus-left-us/","cat":"event","title":"The face Jesus left us"},{"id":"comment-45185","author":"matthias","post":"Gee I ‘d never seen that and agree that’s the most convincing attempt at replication in terms of the appearance of the image. It has some of the image subtlety that the shroud image has unlike other attempts at recreation which have come across as very crude. Still seems fanciful as a credible method of creation however.","date":"2013-09-23","mins":"7:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/23/this-is-one-very-good-way-the-story-is-being-told/","cat":"event","title":"This is one very good way the story is being told"}]
