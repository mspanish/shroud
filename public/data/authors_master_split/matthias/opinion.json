It seemed to me as I recall that Kung was prepared to interpret the Resurrection as a mystical or symbolic event, but which had no necessarily historical reality. At the time, I thought that here was an interpretation that many would be Christians would be able to accept, and so remove a hurdle to their belief. It is a fact of our times that many would be Christians are of a similar view, that the Resurrection as a real historical event is a hurdle that denies their full acceptance of Christianity. The liberal radicals, such as those in the ‘Jesus Seminar’ cannot accept it, seeing it as illogical and unthinkable.” Daveb not sure about the last sentence. Isn’t Marcus Borg part of the ‘Jesus Seminar’? My understanding is that Borg accepts the Resurrection as a real historical event, not in the sense of a physical bodily resuscitation, but in the sense of a spiritual bodily resurrection? ie. He appeared to the disciples as a real SPIRITUAL BODILY PRESENCE / VISION. This was of course recast in some parts of the Bible into a “bodily resuscitation” type of resurrection to accord with Jewish belief and to try and make tangible what we can only assume to be an experience of the risen Christ as a spiritual body that was so real that it also “Seemed” physical. Paul of course tends to emphasise the “Spiritual Body” aspects of the resurrected Jesus, over a skin and bones resuscitation. Is it necessary to believe in the resurrection of Jesus as a real historical event to be a Christian???….","date":"2013-05-07","mins":"4:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33134","author":"matthias","post":"Daveb the Ehrman text is interesting.

That is, Christ’s body dematerialised, and in the event of dematerialising the body left the image behind. So, under this theory, the image does not have to be perfect, as it resulted from a naturalistic process caused by a divine event. Under this theory I have no idea what that naturalistic process could be – obviously bodies do not dematerialise (with the possible exception of Christ) so we can’t measure the naturalistic side effects of that process.

It showed the epitaphios housed in Venice, dated 1200 AD. The epitaphios is kept in the museum of St Mark at the Basilica of St Mark in Venice. You can view a very small image of it here at the museum website: http://www.museosanmarco.it/tesoro tessile/eng/ricami.bsm# click on ‘see the images’ The museum dates it to late 1100s / early 1200s, so generally consistent with Schiller’s dating. On the epitaphios which I viewed in Schiller’s volume, Christ’s body is covered in bloody wounds over most of the body , very unusual for the time. His hands are crossed over the pubic area. He wears a loin cloth, but this does not mean the epitaphios was not based on the shroud (you will of course know of at least 2 artistic ‘copies’ of the shroud from the 1500s onwards where the shroud image is shown with a modesty protecting loin cloth) It’s impossible to say categorically that this epitaphios is based on the shroud, however there are certain congruences with the historical records of a similar time mentioning a full length image of Christ, plus the Hungarian pray codex of a similar time. Is it mere coincidence that this tradition of a bloodied Christ with hands crossed developed at this time, from 1200 1300 AD? Is it irrelevant? Is there a historical / theological explanation beyond the possible influence of the shroud that could explain this development, which occurred outside the general Christian artistic tradition? (beyond these byzantine images a tradition of a bloodied / heavily wounded Christ did not really arrive until the 1300s in Germany) Or was in fact the Shroud in Constantinople circa 1200 AD, and then taken back to France?
