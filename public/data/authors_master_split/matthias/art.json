Hence, the same artistic tradition shows Jesus’s shroud unblemished. This, I think, is one of the key ways in which the Shroud departs from artistic tradition. So keeping an open mind with no (or little) bias towards authenticity, this raises for me several possible explanations: 1. The Shroud really is Christ’s shroud 2. The creators of the shroud in 13th / 14th century Europe departed from the dominant artistic tradition, to create a more ‘authentic’ and believable relic. Something along the lines of “Hey, we all know, despite the artistic tradition, that Jesus was a bloodied and tortured mess, and this is the real thing because it provides evidence of that rather than being a spotless cloth”. 3. The Shroud was really Christ’s Shroud but the major blood markings were added to the body image in the 1300s. Further to scenarios 2 and 3, there was the rise in the 1300s / 1400s of the German artistic movement that showed Christ much more tortured and wounded than even before, and in the mid 1300s the Black Death struck Europe, and there was the rise of flagellants who wounded themselves in the name of Christ. So, certainly, by the time the Shroud was being displayed in Lirey, there was a tradition – unthinkable a century earlier – of Christ as heavily tortured, wounded and bloodied Saviour. Re: scenario 3. I’ve heard the argument against this sort of notion – “there is no image under the blood”. How definitive is this, how confident can we be in this assertion? Hugh, I think you may have questioned this assertion in the past? By the way, I’ve been spending some time thinking about the so called “wrist wounds”. You will all know that a common argument for authenticity is that the wound is on the wrist, not the palm of the hand as per the artistic tradition. Well, using Shroud Scope I have measured the length from the tip of the longest finger to the start of the wound, it came out at about 140mm, or 14cm, noting that it is somewhat difficult to precisely determine the end of the fingers – but I reckon I was close enough. I am 6 foot 2 inches tall, so not dissimilar in height to the supposed height of the man on the shroud. Measuring 14cm from the tip of my longest finger located the wound on my hand as per the shroud around mid palm. For me, this commonly espoused pro authenticity argument is wrong. None of the above means I don’t believe the shroud is authentic (on balance, I do! mainly because of the inexplicability of a man made image, and secondarily by some of the historic records of a seemingly shroud like object in Constantinople). However, we may want to re think the conventional wisdom that the shroud as mad made object departed heavily from the artistic / cultural traditions of the time vis a vis Christ as wounded and tortured saviour versus unblemished and glorified.","date":"2013-09-20","mins":"8:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"id":"comment-44909","author":"matthias","post":"Tying this back to the Pray Manuscript… The red lines still ‘frustrate me’.

Indeed, I wish to take analysis of this matter as far as possible, and exhaust all alternatives. On balance, I still maintain the view that this image is influenced by the Shroud. Consider the Shroud in the 1100’s. There were none of the dominant burn marks than came later in the 1500s. If you imagine that, then you create the following picture: A shroud with a faint ghostly body image, plus noticeable marks of blood, and noticeable poker holes (indeed these 3 features are depicted in the earliest artistic depiction of the shroud. The poker holes are not depicted in later depictions, probably because the burn marks became the dominant non body image feature to depict). In this context, does not a reasonable case present for the lower image depicting the shroud with the cross like markings in the middle between the angel’s feet and the 4 holes representing the faint ephemeral body image, the 4 holes being the poker holes, and the two red lines representing the blood on the shroud?

For example you say: “The Image of Edessa is nowhere described as tetradiplon AFTER Christ has wiped his face on it, and it could not have been Jesus’ burial shroud as this is listed in the Acts as a separate cloth (see the second quotation from the Acts of Thaddeus, above).” If one read the tale as a literal story then you may be right. However, I think it is highly likely that this is a fable. If we assume it is a fable, then it was probably created to explain the Mandylion / Shroud facial image. If that is the case, and if the Mandylion WAS the shroud but with the face only shown due to the folding, then Wilson’s theory does hold up because in the tale the shroud is viewed as the Mandylion ie. As a separate object to the burial shroud (even though the shroud is actually the burial shroud). Also, I don’t think the fact that the cloth is referred to separately as a tetradiplon then as a sindon (after Jesus’ face has been wiped) is necessarily that significant, or problematic. In life, we often describe one object in different ways within one body of text or conversation. Further, I think the variations in the tales over time, including at least one that refers to the full body image, merely hints at some secrecy, mystery and ambiguity behind it all.

Hugh, you raise some questions re: the diagonal lines of crosses etc. Here’s my view, which includes some novel observations: – The object IS a representation (part symbolic / part literal) of the shroud – The pyramid patterns may or may not be an attempt to represent the herringbone weave: perhaps they are there just to represent a weaved cloth, rather than a specific style of weaving associated with the shroud – The 4 holes in a L shape DO reflect the pattern on the shroud, noting that these would have been a very prominent feature of the shroud at the time (prior to the burns from the 1500s or whenever). As de Wesselow states (and I offered this veiw before I ever read his book) the holes make no sense as an artistic pattern, being seemingly random and assymetrical – The diamond shaped area containing the diagonal lines of crosses represents symbolically the image on the shroud – The two red streaks adjacent to the diamond shaped area represent the blood on the body, possibly the two streaks of blood on the arms – The smallish cloth on top of the diamond area represents the Mandylion, and that is conveyed symbolically again by the Jesus face next to Mary’s arm, connected back to the cloth by the intermediary letter (Greek?)

Clearly below Jesus’s head the shroud extends up under the halo to the bearded bloke on the left. “ crossed arms similar to the iconography of earlier depictions of Christ” Yes but neither here nor there to the central question. “ no signs of blood on the actual body, a halo instead of a Crown of Thorns ,again typical of this period.” Yes, but neither here nor there. There was simply an aversion in this historical period to depicting a heavily wounded Christ. “ a coffin lid (compare Duccio) with a stepped pyramid design, not herringbone.” I don’t necessarily buy the argument that the design depicts herringbone. But I think there is a reasonable chance it depicts cloth. Refer to sevreal other examples where the burial cloth or mandylion is shown with various patterns REPRESENTING (rather than literally depicting it) linen. I’m yet to see any artistic image of a coffin lid that looks anything like this. But please do point me in that direction if you know of any. “ a separate cloth, possibly the face cloth mentioned in John, lying on the lid. No signs here again of any image on the cloth.” Refer my previous points that this could be the Mandylion, so no image is no problemo! “ holes on the coffin lid which go up three , then one to the LEFT. The Shroud marks on the top layer go up three ,then one to the RIGHT.( I suppose this is part of your not being literal but it reminds me of the people who said that the pyramids represented a star pattern,until someone noted that that they had turned the stars completely the wrong way round ( and that other than the three major pyramids none of the other pyramids fitted).” Yes you hit the nail on the head. Being over literal is beside the point. “Red stains mean nothing unless they are on the Shroud.” Well if what you and Hugh think is a coffin lid is actually the shroud – as I maintain – then it means a lot! Again, what on earth would the lines symbolise if the object was a coffin lid????

But the fact that the lower object has a pattern and the shroud in the upper image does not have a pattern doesn’t mean much, if anything, to the central question here. De Wesselow describes the difficulty for an artist – particularly one who is not highly skilled and working on a small medium such as the Pray Manuscript artist – in representing the blurry shroud image. The artist has shown the body, which mirrors the image, after all in the upper anointing scene. And given the faint, ephemeral like image of the Shroud, is there not some logic in conveying it in a hazily symbolic artistic manner? Then, conveying the shroud in the lower image with patterns, shapes, lines, ephemeral objects etc makes total sense. To take this further – the upper image is a highly literal image, the lower image is filled with symbolism and mystique. Was the different treatment intentional, to highlight the worldly experience of Christ’s anointing versus the otherworldly experience of the empty tomb with the angel etc???? The two images are entirely different in a stylistic sense, so it makes little sense to compare one with the other. They might have even been drawn by different artists! I hear people consistently dismiss any significance to the two wiggly red lines. Now, if one accepts that it is highly unlikely that the artist would have just randomly drawn these (they make no sense from a decorative perspective), then I would argue that there is no logical explanation other than blood, in which case blood on a coffin lid doesn’t make sense, blood on a shroud does.

This is patently untrue. Both images are entirely consistent with dozens of contemporary illustrations of the scenes they depict, and appear, together, in almost exactly the same format, in one of the illustrations I quoted above. Cloth, in both illustrations, looks like cloth, and rigid stuff, in both illustrations, looks like rigid stuff. It was perhaps an exaggeration on my part to call the images “entirely different”. “Different” would have been better. The figures are in a similar illustrative artistic style. But my main point is still highly relevant and “True” (rather than patently untrue), I believe. That is, the upper image is essentially literal, the lower image is largely symbolic, mystical and cryptic – so the images are different in “nature and meaning” if not “artistic style” (it’s as if the artist ate some magic mushrooms between drawing the two images). I don’t know why this is, but can only speculate it might have something to do with trying to represent the mystical, mysterious experience of the resurrection, versus the worldly nature of Jesus’s burial preparation. You argue that there is a great degree of continuity with artistic tradition. There certainly is some continuity! But there is also clearly evident discontinuity! This includes: – Jesus shown naked. Yes I know there are couple of examples elsewhere of Him naked but this is still very much an overwhelming minority of the artistic tradition (probably less than 1%) – Jesus with a small beard (more like scruff). Now this is very very odd, given the overwhelming tradition of the time of a reasonably fully bearded Jesus. Why? Again speculation, but in the very faint image (not contrast enhanced) on the shroud it is difficult to view the facial hair as being much more than a relatively small ‘goatee’. I keep an open mind but struggle to come up with any alternative explanations given the tradition discontinuity – And the greatest discontinuity occurs in the lower image, where there seems to be no comparable tradition in terms of the style of decorative depiction of the rectangular objects, no comparison in terms of red blood like streaks and L shaped hole configurations, no comparison in terms of a face (Jesus’s?) adjacent to Mary’s sleeve, with an intermediary letter / symbol ‘floating’ between Mary and the rectangular object !!! Chris B (comment 94) may have a point that the object is the Shroud lying across the coffin lid. The likelihood is we will never be able to fully understand these things, and it will always come down to interpretation and points of view. I agree that many of the points I and others make can be considered speculative, although I think there is some strength to the view that the number of possible congruences, even if cryptic, between these images and the Shroud are perhaps too many to claim ‘coincidence’..","date":"2013-09-10","mins":"10:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"id":"comment-43594","author":"matthias","post":"Is the blood like spot above the right eye in the Pray Manuscript and similar marks in the hair – reminiscent of the Shroud – just another strange coincidence?.","date":"2013-09-10","mins":"6:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"id":"comment-43754","author":"matthias","post":"Interesting paper by a Holger A Klein “Sacred Relics and Imperial Ceremonies at the Great Palace of Constantinople” http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Klein/Sacred Relics and Imperial Ceremonies.pdf Interesting reference to an “acheiropoietos icon” of Christ, which, according to George Kedrenos, arrived in the capital (Constantinople) “from those of Kamouliana, a village in Cappadocia” in the reign of Justin II (565 578 AD).
