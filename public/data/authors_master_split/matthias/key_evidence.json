[{"id":"comment-72093","author":"matthias","post":"Yes, it’s hard to distill it as one reason, but the biggest one for me is that the image is inherently unlike what we would expect from a 13th/14th century artist, most particularly the ultra realism of the image (the kinked leg and turned in foot on the dorsal image is a big one for me), the nudity, and a number of the blood marks.
