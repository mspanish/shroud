[{"id":"comment-72222","author":"chesterbelloc","post":"My completely unscientific reason for believing in the Shroud’s authenticity: The Face. The peace that is present on that face, despite the most humiliating tortures the man who was buried in the Shroud endured. This convinces me that it’s Jesus Christ. The real reasons: what everyone else has said. How can this be a product of human artifice? Who did it? Why don’t more examples of this kind of artwork exist? How could the image be superficial and not penetrate the fibrils? Why is it a negative? Also, this will probably cause some ridicule(I hope Joe Nickell isn’t reading this!), but I’m convinced that the Shroud is authentic even if it does come from the 14th century. As someone who comes from the Catholic tradition, I believe that the one Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross is made present daily on the altars of the Catholic Church,the Orthodox Church, and every ecclesial communion with a valid priesthood. As such, I do believe that a miracle could have occurred in the Middle Ages that made the miraculous image of Christ appear on a cloth through some divine intervention. Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich does talk about miraculous, not made by hand copies of the Shroud being created in the Middle Ages through some paranormal occurrence. I believe it’s much more likely that this is the Shroud that wrapped Christ in the tomb, but the medieval date doesn’t mean it didn’t come from the Hand of God, at least for me. “Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.” Revelation 5:12.","date":"2014-01-04","mins":"7:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/04/what-one-single-characteristic-about-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"What one single characteristic about the shroud  . . . ?"}]
