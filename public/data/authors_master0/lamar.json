When I was 21 iwas at a party with about 50 people I didn’t know a lot of bad people . Got into a fight at least ten of them . They beat me to the point I said under my breath Jesus please have mercy on me don’t let me die cause they wont have mercy on me. I ended up with 4 stab wounds and 1 was an eighth of an inch from my lung. I’m going on 27 ..
