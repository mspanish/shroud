{"art":[{"author":"daniel_james","post":"As a Christian and artist myself, I can relate to Akiane’s passion and determination to capture what God has given her to share with and help others. That is what gifts are for. It’s what gives them meaning. Her paintings are inspiring and beautiful. They touch the heart profoundly. I see a story in each one. Some are warnings, some are hope reaching out and some are examples of love, beauty and grace. I pray God will keep her on the straight path and continue to bless her with more gifts to share through his Son, our Savior, Jesus Christ.","date":"October 20, 2011 at 7:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
