The last time i tried i heard a voice tell me “This is not the plan I have for you my child” (Those EXACT WORDS). As I looked up I saw Him… I saw Jesus Christ. And Today I saw this picture and this is with every detail the saem Jesus I saw. And I saw Him again at my parent’s funeral this year, I felt his hand on my should and INSTANTLY I was calmed.Now days I help run the Youth side of my Church while studying my Advanced Diploma at Bible College. I now know the plans HE has for me, I am in need of this book.
