I don’t know if you have read much of my blog, but, please God, I have been accepted into the Carmel of Kirk Edge in Sheffield, UK (http://www.kirkedge.org.uk).  This Carmel, like some others, give your religious name before you enter – mine is to me Sr. Maravillas of Jesus and the Holy Face so I have a big devotion to the Holy Face and have several posts on it.  St. Maravillas of Jesus is one my favor Carmelite saints.
