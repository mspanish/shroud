And that the hemp has shown little sign of natural degradation. So there is a question about image formation and the hemp base. A STURP type team could design testing protocols to validate these claims or debunk them. In the event tests were sanctioned (which I’m doubtful of) there would at least be good protocols in place for them. That’s not unproductive.You’re right though, there is massive difference between these two images in that the Shroud’s image formation may be proven, someday, to have been caused by a natural (if extraordinary) process. The Tilma can only have had, if ‘authentic’, a supernatural origin. There are no natural explanations for it — apart from direct human creation.","date":"June 7, 2013 at 4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/07/the-shroud-of-turin-our-lady-of-guadalupe-tilma/","cat":"event","title":"The Shroud of Turin & Our Lady of Guadalupe Tilma"}],"image":[{"author":"looneytombs","post":"Fascinating and tragic anecdote!

Do you think the Protestant Reformation was a good thing? In the end it did lead to greater spreading of the Faith as the resulting conflicts of division forced Christians to new lands in the search of freedom from other Christians. The days of ‘no salvation outside the Catholic Church’ are not so very far behind us. In the original post I was disappointed to see remarks being made about religious matters not directly linked to the Shroud (the subject of this blog). It seems that even here, in the face of this wonderful mystery, we look for division rather than humble unity. If children end up fighting over a gift would it not be better to not have given them the gift in the first place?","date":"April 25, 2013 at 3:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/25/quote-for-today-better-to-be-proven-a-fraud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today:  Better to be Proven a Fraud?"},{"author":"looneytombs","post":"My reserve wasn’t addressed to you alone.","date":"April 26, 2013 at 7:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/25/quote-for-today-better-to-be-proven-a-fraud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today:  Better to be Proven a Fraud?"},{"author":"looneytombs","post":"And this is the sad thing about the Shroud, that even if one day it is proven to be the death shroud of Jesus, Christians will still argue and debate over its significance and exploit it to prove their own religious dogmatic convictions.

Rogers could have published his findings on a napkin at that point and it should have been accepted. The man was faced with a discovery that he realized altered the landscape about the Shroud re: the carbon dating. He’d expected to debunk the invisible weave claim and instead was convinced by it. He was in a race against time to ensure this discovery, now corroborated by his own examination, was documented. He turned to his trusted colleague Barry and a familiar journal to do that. Best practice from a scientific standpoint? No. Selfish cronyism? Only if you believe Rogers was a man lacking personal and professional integrity.","date":"May 9, 2013 at 12:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/08/joe-nickells-new-book-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"Joe Nickell’s New Book: The Science of Miracles"},{"author":"looneytombs","post":"My apologies, again it’s me, David Goulet – clearly WordPress-challenged.","date":"May 9, 2013 at 12:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/08/joe-nickells-new-book-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"Joe Nickell’s New Book: The Science of Miracles"}]}
