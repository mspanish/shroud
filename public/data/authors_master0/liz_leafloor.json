{"researchers":[{"author":"liz_leafloor","post":"Hi Colin, loving your ongoing research! It was good to be introduced to the very interesting pilgrimage badge. I didn’t realize they made ones which included images of the shroud. If I may, you have put quite a lot of thought into naming your process, but you mention that you’re looking to publicize outside your site. From a publishing point of view, the label ‘unqueering’ may prove a stumbling block in that regard, what with the modern use of the term. Just my two cents, and no disrespect or discouragement intended. 🙂","date":"July 29, 2016 at 4:20 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: “Shroud of Turin – and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic) science”"},{"author":"liz_leafloor","post":"Hi Colin! Great work – I can’t see a better theory for the creation of the Turin Shroud than the one you’ve demonstrated here. This makes total sense, and the results have that unnerving after image that what I believe makes the shroud so intriguing to people. I was surprised the image survived washing, and that familiar remaining ‘ghost’ says it all.","date":"July 5, 2016 at 5:44 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: “Shroud of Turin – and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic) science”"},{"author":"liz_leafloor","post":"Thanks very much for the kind mention, Colin.
