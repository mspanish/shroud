There are even more problems then I previously suspected, as Stephen jones has brilliantly noted on his blog.The more I research into this the more unplausable this theory becomes.http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html?m=1A second problem concerns the directional relationship between points on the body to their corresponding image location on the Shroud. For example, a point on the side of the nose might conceivably be mapped perpendicular to the local body surface, or the local cloth surface where point is imaged, or vertically upwards from the nose point onto the Shroud. After careful study, I have concluded that body points are imaged essentially in the vertical upwards direction for the entire frontal image. This conclusion is further reinforced by noting that there are no side images about the frontal image and particularly in the space between the frontal and dorsal heads. If the image formation mechanism discolored the Shroud according to a principle that projected perpendicular to either the body or cloth surfaces, image shading should have occurred along the sides of the body and at the top of the head. On the other hand, a vertical mapping logically precludes shading in these regions where, in fact, no shading is observed.We cannot, however, argue that the cloth was held away from the sides of the body as an attempt to explain the lack of side images, or that intervening material, such as burial spices, blocked image formation. Lavoie has shown that the blood feature off the elbow in Figure 1 could only have occurred by direct contact of the cloth with the side of the arm. Thus, the Shroud must have been in intimate contact with the body at that location and, yet, no image discolorations were formed there.A similar argument follows from a consideration of the space between the frontal and dorsal heads. Geometrically, the Shroud must have been in intimate contact with the top of the head, as we have shown by enfolding a human body in a cloth model of the Shroud. Again, no image discolorations can be seen there. A hypothetical chin band may explain part of the void, but it is likely not to have covered the entire head and at the same time tuck neatly under the jaw.","date":"December 28, 2012 at 8:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/thibault-heimburger-now-i-know-for-sure-that-the-ts-body-image-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger: Now, I know for sure that the TS body image is not a scorch"}],"misc":[{"author":"bippy123","post":"Move over zeitgeist,another religious conspiracy put out by the moral relativists down their in angelic Hollywood lol","date":"February 27, 2013 at 6:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/22/new-movie-with-a-dose-of-religious-conspiracy-surrounding-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Movie with a dose of religious conspiracy surrounding the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"bippy123","post":"Their = there opps","date":"February 27, 2013 at 6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/22/new-movie-with-a-dose-of-religious-conspiracy-surrounding-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Movie with a dose of religious conspiracy surrounding the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"bippy123","post":"Yannick, if your a catholic you know what Christ said about his church and the gates of hades not prevailing over it right?","date":"April 25, 2013 at 3:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/24/so-which-hypothesis-of-all-those-ever-proposed-do-i-prefer/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"So which hypothesis, of all those ever proposed, do I prefer?"}],"opinion":[{"author":"bippy123","post":"Being a catholic myself, it seems like this pastor is very ignorant about not only bible history and church history but of also early Christian history.

Avoiding the controversy surrounding the date, the author presents a plausibility argument to reconcile its visual and forensic properties with extent 14th century printing technology, geographical circumstance and historical context. The observed 3-d properties of the image are discussed in relationship to physical image formation processes and a plausible explanation for this extraordinary effect is given based printing techniques known to exist at that time and in that locale. Further the argument is reinforced with analytical results showing that under any reasonable assumption about the surface bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) including the use of measured human skin data, the observed 3-d properties cannot be reconciled with any known radiative imaging process and thus must be a contact process.I really wanted to attend the conference.
