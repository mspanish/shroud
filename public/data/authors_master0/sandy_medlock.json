{"art":[{"author":"sandy_medlock","post":"I, too, just finished reading this wonderful book.  It made me feel even more anxious to go to heaven.  I’ve had a couple of life-threatening health emergencies  in the last 4 years during which I was afraid to die – first a stroke, then where I was short of breath and diagnosed with COPD, but now, thanks to Colton, I won’t fear it when the time really does come.I also miscarried a couple of babies, and I’m delighted to think that I may know them in heaven.  I’ve never even known their gender.   I only birthed one child, a son after the miscarriages, and he has also always wondered about the siblings he might have had.","date":"October 10, 2011 at 6:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/24/more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
