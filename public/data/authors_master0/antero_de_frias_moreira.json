in partially flexed position, and if this is true, as it seems from Dr. Petrus Soons Hologram of the Man of the Shroud, distal extremities of the fingers are farther away from the covering sheet than more proximal carpal área.Anyway the image is not a radiograph and can not be compared to a plain wrist/hand X-Ray so any measurements done on it are but approximative.Nevertheless if I draw a line in correspondence to the axis of the fourth metacarpal bone the exit nail wound is quite near to it in the medial carpal área possibly on the so called Destot’s space(between the lunatum, triquetrum capitatum and hamatum bones) as described by Dr. Pierre Barbet.Thus I think that from an anatomical point of view, nothing contradicts the hypothesis of the exit wound be on the carpal área.

the palmar (volar) face of the wrist iabout the middle of the palmar crease, no major arterial vessel is damaged.Actually,, radial artery,, ulnar artery and superficial palmar arch are spared from injury, meaning that no major arterial bleeding will occur.Curiously, if nailing was at the palm in the intermetacarpal spaces,, small arterial vessels (common digital) could be damaged with bleeding ,but even so as it was previously asserted on this blog, Philippines crucifixion volunteers don’t show relevant hand bleedingIf we analyze left wrist exit nail wound as depicted on the Shroud image it seems it fits Dr. Barbet’s description of an area at the level of Destot’s anatomical space of the carpus (it’s a virtual space between te lunate, triquetrum capitatum and hamatum bones )The nail didn’t damage major arterial vessels during his way through the wrist because on the dorsal aspect of the wrist there are no important arterial vessels either.We can conclude that wrist hemorrage originates mainly from damage of the wrist network veins, and blood pouring from the wound had to be slow, but when the nail was removed there could be an increased transient bleeding ,,this time post mortem blood.I utterly agree with Dr. Kelly Kearse and Paulette that many unknown factors like sweat, hair , abrasions etc. can modify the direction of blood trails on the forearms, nevertheless the blood flow we observe on the Shroud clearly indicates that blood moved proximally (from wrist to the elbows) so iit’s not unreasonable to conclude that it occured in a crucifixion position with arms forming an angle about 60 degrees with vertical line of gravity.Dr. Gil Lavoie has done an extensive research on this issue ,where the important fact of the outside elbow stain is analyzed in the

which the blood rivulets we observe on the Shroud were produced let alone to reproduce them in any kind of experiment.In a real crucifixion by nailing through the wrists and accordingly to Dr. Barbet’s claim no major arterial or venous blood vessels would be injured it seems that along with small venous vessels only tiny carpal branches from the radial and ulnar arteries would be pierced.So being a mixture of arterial and venous blood would be slowly exiting from the carpal exit nail wound.We have also to consider movements of superior limbs while hanging on the cross and the exact position of them relative to the gravity line during those movements.Contact transter of bloody exudates from forearm clots and washing or not washing he body before wrapping  in the Shroud are certainly other aspects to be considered. The bloody rivulets of the experiment were obtained in different conditions.Concerning the side wound, the bloody material on the Shroud is surely post mortem blood from the right atrium and superior cava vein  and a serous fluid from a traumatic pericardial or pleural effusion.The «blood belt» would form by gravity when the Man of the Shroud was moved to the suppine position with a little inclination to the right side and residual blood flew from inferior cava vein.This is of course an hypothetical scenario perhaps the closest to reality and it seems to me that the conditions of the experiment of Dr. Matteo Morrini and Professor Luigi Garlaschelli  did not take into account these and perhaps other unknown conditions.So it turns out their conclusion «Taken together the results of these tests are therefore not consistent with the general trend of the rivulets of blood on the Shroud of Turin and seem to refuse to testify in favor of their authenticity, but rather in an artistic or didactic.» was drawn in a hasty way.( fact that does not surprise me)                                                                           regards                                                            Antero de Frias Moreira                                                       Centro Português de Sindonologia","date":"April 13, 2015 at 12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/11/new-garlaschelli-and-borrini-study/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"New Garlaschelli and Borrini Study"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"When I wrote my comment I had not yet seen Dr. Thibault Heimburger’s comment, so I congratulate him too and I invite him to show us the results of his experiment.«If the arm needs to be moist with sweat, or grimy with dirt, or the blood needs to be a little thicker to slow it down, then let these experiments commence! Antero points out that as no major blood vessels are, pierced (and I might add that with the wound level or above the head blood pressure is minimal anyway) very little blood would come out at any time, although if the wound were continuously agitated, perhaps sporadic flow could be stimulated until death, when no more blood would be expected, even after removal of the nailThis time I agree with Dr. Hugh Farey that conditions like sweat aand possible particles of dust on the surface of forearms could also have some influence on the aspect of the blood trails.Actually if a normal individual elevates his superior limb above head level there is an instantaneous blood pressure dropping at distal level but soon homeostatic mechanisms from the sympathetic nervous system adjust blood arterial vessel tonus to the new postural condition so blood pressure dropping is well compensated or minimal.Only in pathological conditions like anomalies of thoraxic outlet or arterial diseases is blood flow to the extremity compromised when one elevates the arms above head level,Although blood pressure dropping in superior limbs due to the state of hypovolemic schock and crucifixion position of superior limbs( inclination at about 60 degrees to the vertical?) are important aspects to consider, these would not preclude at all some blood exiting from the dorsal (and volar) wrist exit nail wounds.Nevertheless these conditions would possibly cause a low or very low velocity blood flow and the aspects of the blood trails would also be related to the time the body was hanging on the cross by the progressive adding of small quantities od blood.As we see from previous considerations it is not easy to reproduce in a single experiment the gathering of ALL the conditions present when the Man of the Shroud was crucified and the conclusions of this skeptic experiment are worthless.This does not mean that new experiments shoul not be tried, but not in  such a simple approach.                                                                                            regards                                                                             Antero de Frias Moreira                                                                          Centro Português de Sindonologia","date":"April 14, 2015 at 5:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/11/new-garlaschelli-and-borrini-study/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"New Garlaschelli and Borrini Study"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Dear LouisI appreciate your kind words but I don’t consider myself «a very serious scholar»I’m just a humble Physical and Rehabilitation medical doctor fascinated by the Shroud who seeks to learn more and more about the Shroud and I learned a lot from your comments and from the ones of many bloggers in this wonderful website                                                                I thank all of you                                                           Antero de Frias Moreira","date":"September 4, 2015 at 10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

YES THEY ARE.What is their opinion?I’ll quote only a fewDr. Robert Bucklin: Upon examining the chest, the pathologist notes a large blood stain over the right pectoral area Close examination shows a variance in intensity of the stain consistent with the presence of two types of fluid, one comprised of blood, and the other resembling water. There is distinct evidence of a gravitational effect on this stain with the blood flowing downward and without spatter of other evidence of the projectile activity which would be expected from blood issuing from a functional arterial source. This wound has all the characteristics of a postmortem type flow of blood from a body cavity or from an organ such as the heart. At the upper plane of the wound is an ovoid skin defect which is characteristic of a penetrating track produced by a sharp puncturing instrument.Dr Delfin Villalain (and orthopedic surgeon Professor de Palacios Carvajal):5.2 The separated blood of the side woundComment to § 3.2. Would the side wound reveal that the blood circulation was still active?The side wound resulted from a blow with a sharp instrument, like a spear, driven through the 5thintercostal space (Barbet, 1954; 1970; Baima Bollone, 1990, 2000).It consists of an oval, elongated mark (4 x 1.5 cm, Fig. 3, in yellow) corresponding to the areawhere the spear entered, plus a bloody outflow 6 cm wide and 15 cm long. The injury shows thatthe skin has been sharply cut, having pointed extremities and rectilinear wide open lips as if thedamaging agent had deeply penetrated (Baima Bollone, 1994). The wound does not show signs ofvital retraction, as should happen in the case of a living person, and the blow must have beeninflicted on a corpse (Baima Bollone, 1990, 1994, 2000; Zugibe, 2005).The outflow is composed of some rivulets of red liquid (blood) plus a clearer liquid (serum), asrevealed by UV photos (made by G.B. Judica Cordiglia 1988 and V. Miller 1981). See Fig. 3 andthe graphic elaboration of TS high resolution photos (Bedon et al., 2008). Such kind of stain ispossible if internal body structures have been wounded. In addition Baima Bollone (1994) observesthat wounds of a living person bleed actively, whereas this outflow has all the characteristics of apassive drainage.Fig. 3. On the upper left, ultraviolet photograph of the lancewound which enhances the serum contraction rings aroundthe bloodstain (courtesy of V. Miller 1981 and A. Adler, fromThe Orphanated Manuscript, 2002, Fig. 2). On the right side,wound bloodstain as seen on the TS. The main blood rivulethas been enhanced in red.INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE SHROUD OF TURIN PERSPECTIVES OF A MULTIFACETEDENIGMA: COLUMBUS – OHIO AUGUST 14-17, 20087A possible source for the blood is liquid accumulation in situ (within the thoracic cavity) andsubsequent separation of its components after a hemopericardium (most probable), a hemothorax(Baima Bollone, 1990; 2000) or a huge thoracic trauma (Battaglini, 1987, 1990; Pisano, 1991).The blood separation into its components is considered a sign of death, because the blood mustrest still for a certain period of time and blood circulation must be obviously stopped to allow it(Baima Bollone, 1994, and references therein, Zugibe, 2005).The repeated bleeding of this wound does not mean that the heart was beating and the man wasalive, but can be easily explained by passive flowing of blood during body transport (Baima Bollone,1990, 1994; Coppini, 1992), probably responsible also for the blood belt on the dorsal image.  in «The death of the Shroud Man an improved review» http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p07.pdf Professor Baima Bollone has a similar opinion regarding the side wound and  states that blood flow from the feet left an imprint of mixed vital and post mortem blood. in The Forensic Characteristics of the Blood Marks, International Scientific Symposium Torino 2-5 March 2000I could cite more examples but not to make this comment too long I’ll end here.SO DESPITE ALL THE FUSS IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS POST MORTEM BLOOD ON THE SHROUD                                                                        regards                                                        Antero de Frias Moreira                                                (Centro Português de Sindonologia)","date":"August 27, 2015 at 3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

the husband Antero de Frias Moreira)wrote something in this blog (May 2, 2012) about the“Two Thousand Year-Old Ointment Residue Discovered on the Shroud”Here the opinion:>…Dr.Marcia Boi’s presentation, which although it showed images with a good quality,did not convince us on the validity of her claims.»At Bari Dr Marzia Boi has done an interesting presentation about Shroud pollen issue the image quality was excellent, it had been agreable indeed to listen the speaker reasonig nevertheless in my humble opinion her claims are flawed and I’ll try to explain you why:The tenets of her theory are: As main pollens on the Shroud are from entomophilous pollination they could not have got iinto the fabric weave interstices by usual contamination.Max Frei and other botanists namely Professor Avinoam Danin and Uri Baruch misidentified Gundelia Tournefortii pollens which in her opinion are Helichrisum spp. and you may read on her paper«The genus of Helichrysum seems to be the most abundantpollen on the linen» and «by pressing the Helichrisum floers an excellent oil is produced»The body of the Man of The Shroud was anoited with oils and balsams, so the reason for finding entomophilous pollens like the alleged Gundelia Tournefortii which turned out to be Helichrisum was because of the body anointment.Placement of flowers on the cloth beside or over the body is once more categorically discarded    « plants were never allowed to touch the cadaver directly» and the same applies to body washing            «The body prepared for funeral and burial wasnot washed or cleaned with water; proof of this is the presenceof blood and the stains from wounds that can be seen on theShroud».My reasons to question this theory are as follows:It puzzles my mind why experienced botanists like Max Frei and most importantly, israeli botanists would misidentify a kind of pollen from their own country.Dr. Marzia Boi bases this claim only on photographs, not direct examination by microscope of any remainig pollen samples.The competence and honesty of professor Danin was personally mentioned to me by a jewish speaker at Bari conference.The presence of entomophilous pollen- in this case Helichrisum not the allegedly misidentified Goundekla Tournefortii-on the fabric is allegedly justified because the body had been embalmed with an expensive Helichrisum oil.Actually you can read references to deposition of flowers beside the body in ancient jewish burial rituals- you just have to google it ,an a lot of reliable information will pop up.This practice was confirmed to me at 2012 Valencia Shroud Congress by Dr. Rebecca Jackson who is an expert in ancient jewish history and customs.So it turns out that the presence of entomophilous pollens can be easily explained by the deposition of flowers on the Shroud.Blood marks on the Shroud namely the scourge marks are very well defined and their boundaries are clear cut.If the body had not been washed and was extensively anointed with oils and balsams the bloody material would have surely spread. so it turns out scourge marks would be absolutely  undefined.The question of washing or not washing the body has already been approached on this blog and I agree with Professor Zugibe’s opinion that the Man of the Shroud «was washed»At least a kind of hasty washing had to be done namely life blood shed  on the dorsal trunk otherwise we would see a big undefined blood stain on the cloth, not the multiple so well defined dumbell scourge marks-actually this is the proof that the body was washed, at least in some areas.These are the main reasons why we were not convinced at Valencia and this second presentation although quite well constructed did’t convince me either.

for cutting the sample.I do not question the technical laboratory procedures for dating the sample by AMS, but dating discrepancies should raise doubts about homogeneity of the sample and presence of rogue fibers, a fact that had not been considered.It’s true that at least british scientists were very glad with the results of radiocarbon dating, and there was an obscure funding for the British Museum after the press release announcing the results 1260-1390 A.D.-NEVERTHELESS THIS IS BY NO MEANS EVIDENCE THAT THE RESULTS WERE FALSIFIED….Later studies as everyone knows( I will not go on arguing..) confirmed what previous Shroud researchers as Professor Adler supposed I mean that the sample was not representative of the rest of the Shroud, backing Sue Benford and Joe Marino’s reweaving hypothesis.So it turns out we stil don’t have a valid radiocarbon dating of the Shroud.Professor Marinelli pointed out this important issue in Valencia Shroud Congress 2012:A new radiocarbon sample should be done only after a mature analysis by experts from several fields of science namely textile, physics and chemistry.Professor Rogers pointed out that thymol use in cleaning the Shroud container could compromise the accuracy of a new radiocarbon dating of the cloth.If the Savoy’s cutted small pieces of the Shroud and also extrated threads to integrate them into copies of the Shroud or as gifts as historian Dr. Carlos Evaristo claims, then this will make things even worse for an accurate new radiocarbon dating.                                                              regards

opinion from which I disagree and I invite people to read both papers and draw their own conclusions.I wonder if as time goes by pollen material under the tapes deteriorate and preclude a correct identification at higher taxonomical levels-I’m convinced this really happens.Perhaps because of this condition Professors Scannerini and Caramiello disagree from former Dr.Frei’s classification not to mention Danin, Baruch and later Professor Litt,Nevertheless we should consider that more than 20 years elapsed from the time Dr.Frei collected the samples.The question is: if these botanists had observed the tapes in 1978 would the disagreement be so great?Although we cannot too much insist on the pollen issue as described by Dr. Max Frei as very strong piece of evidence on the geographical trail of the Shroud, we can’t dismiss it either as a fraud.Until further pallinological studies are done (perhaps on Frei’s tapes or even better on new collected samples)In my humble opinion I think the words of botanist Dr. Mariotti Lippi summarizes what we can state with safety on the pollen evidence«….I concluded that the Shroud in some unspecified period of time stayed in the Midle East.Where

The “perfect” form of the little balls is similar to the “perfect” form of the trails of blood. Too “perfect” to be true.»The last sentence simply is not trueDaveb has already made reference to the excellent paper on this subject by Professor Giulio fanti and Barbara Faccini nevertheless I’d add the following:It’s simply not true that all scourge marks have perfect  dumbell lshapes matching the roman flagrum whipping.It’s impossible for the punisher to apply the same strength and direction to every lash, so some lashes would produce only contusions and bruisings of soft tissues while most of them would probably injury the subcutaneous fat and even muscles below and skin tearing could occur.When subcutaneous fat tissue and muscles were injured by the «flagrum plumbatae» bleeding would occur and soon an extended area of blood smear anc clotting should follow.If this was the case neither clear cut scourging marks nor body image would be apparent.Dr.Thibault Heimburger has already mentioned Professor Zugibe’s hypothesis that the Man of the Shroud was washed.By removing that large dried blood area by washing reopened scourging lesions that  reached subcutaneous fat and muscular layer would bleed again even if their correspondent skin area was torn away and it is not unreasonable to assert that the shape of this re-bleeding would match the offensive object, bacause what bleeds is not the superficial  skin layer but the subcutaneous fat and muscle,, in other words the shape of blood marks from scourging is related to bleeding from muscle an fat NOT THE SUPERFICIAL SKIN.This is exactly what we observe on the Shroud let alone the fact that besides U.V. Fluorescence photographs show a serum halo around the scourge marks.This is a FACT and no medieval forger would be able to accomplish such a deed!!!.For me this is the most plausible medical explanation and the most probable scenario that I share with you.For ethical motives it is not possible to reproduce such a scenario with a living person who would be killed by crucifixion partially washed and wrapped in a linen sheetThus a definitive experimental answer cannot be given and I think the previous reasoning is enough.                                                                               regards                                                                       Antero de Frias Moreira                                                              Centro Português de Sindonologia","date":"May 18, 2015 at 11:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"As usual in this Blog Dr. Hugh Farey wrote a  rebuttal of my comment   « U.V.

I’ve studied with much attention most of scientific papers on the Shroud and it puzzles my mind  how «kitchen lab» experiments can hastily cast doubts on established facts, backed by studying samples from the Shroud with sophisticated technical tools.I mean for exemple the Shroud image not being a scorch was a conclusion Dr. Thibault Heimburger got from several linen scorch experiments and microscopical observation and even light scorch produces  effects on linen fibers with microscopical characteristics different from Shroud image fibers.. Dr John Jackson, Dr. Adler Dr. Heller, Professor Raymond Rogers and other scientists OBSERVED THE SHROUD IN SITU AND GOT SAMPLES FROM IT for off-site study.Photographs, fibers dusts particles have been thoroughly studied and characterized.Are these scientists dishonest or are they trying to fool people because they have an hidden agenda?I don’t think so.If Dr Thibault Heimburger states the Shroud image cannot be a scorch (and he is not the only scientist to conclude that…) it turns out it’s worthless to try to demontrate the opposite.As a science man I sicerely hope Vatican releases data gathered on material collected in 2002 restoration.Professor Bruno Barberis spoke an interesting lecture at 2012 Valencia Shroud Congress presenting a list of new physical and chemical tests to be done on the Shroud.Having been asked when, he said he hoped the Pope granted permission in a near future, I also hope so.May be questions skeptics are making can be answered in a definitive way,, namely the recent one of the possibility of colored image fibers under bloodstains.I’m pretty sure if protéases will be applied on such blood fibers the same result as Professor Adler will show up.Centro Português de Sindonologia is a modest non profit association, not a «publicity machine», and we can’t afford doing scientific investigation on the Shroud,  and our presentations  don’t have a religious agenda.Our presentations are backed on reliable historical and scientific works to make people aware of this awesome Christian relic.in a rational way.                                                                                     regards                                                                      Antero de Frias Moreira","date":"November 27, 2013 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/21/colins-scorch-under-a-microscope/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin’s Scorch Under a Microscope"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"I utterly agree with Daveb when it comes  to the excellence of Dr,Latendresse’s paper.I think the question of how the cloth was placed over the top of the head was already analyzed on this blog and it is my personal opinion that an air gap beteen the top of the head and the cloth cannot be excluded based only on empirical paper measurements and «medium» anatomical distances from the front and the back top of the head.This point of view shoud certainly be considered if a contact mechanism /normal to the skin mechanism is assumed as the way the image formed on the cloth.On the contrary if the Body wrapped in the cloth projected His image onto the cloth by an orthogonal collimated way as Professor Alan Adler (and other researchers) thought), then there’s no problem accepting that the cloth was firmly drawn over the top of the head.Professor Latendresse nicely explained the boodstain issue but a question puzzles my mind, and I think it would be useful to discuss it on this blog:BLOODSTAINS ON THE SIDES OF THE FACE APPARENTLY ON THE HAIR-IF A CONTACT MECHANISM IS ASSUMED FOR THEIR IMPRESSION ON THE CLOTH DID THEY ORIGINATE FROM THE FACE OR FROM THE HAIR?There are contradictory findingsEveryone remembers Dr. Gilbert Lavoie’s experience with a stained sheet covering the head of a long hair bearded man and the conclusion was staightforward: bloodstains beside the face of the Man of he Shroud and apparently on the hair originated from the anatomical face.On the other way Dr. Petrus Soons states that when image processing expert Bernardo Galmarini «replaced» the previously removed bloodstains over the 3D face model they appear  on the hair on two sides of the face!!!Weird enough isn’t it?

nevertheless the images obtained were quite different.Professor Di Lazzaro’s laser brush face on fabric seems an artistic depiction of the Shroud face.Professor Fanti’s ventral manikin image obtained by external electric field generating corona discharge is absolutely different from the original, namely significant distortions, although at microscopical level the results were quite similar to Shroud colored fibers.One silly question then came to my mind: why did not they place a corpse inside the device instead of a metallic manikin? would that improve the macroscopic aspect of the resulting image?Obviously ethycal and legal principles preclude that kind of experiment, but my guess is perhaps some kitchen lab scientists will pick up the idea to do experimental work with dead animals ( I recall an experiment with a pig some time ago but with poor results)                                                   I wish you all a Merry Christmas

alternative but to change my mind.Pope Francis certainly believes the Shroud is real otherwise he would not have attitudes of reverence with other relics, after all the Shroud is the most important christian relic.It does not surprise me at all that he had spoken about the Devil because he himself performed a kind of exorcism on a disabled boy allegedly with a demonic possession.Are exorcists fanatic priests or are they priest with a special training skill to fight with the dark forces?I don’t buy theories of «modern» so called theologians that deny the Devil’s existence and state that Christ’s ressurrection was a spiritual event ( I really don’t know what they mean with that).If Christian religions did not have a mystic side namely miracles and the fight with evil, christian doctrine would be just a kind of empty philosophy.The Shroud is the living testimony that something happened with Jesus body in that dark tomb, and no matter what the physics and chemistry of that event were they left the imprint of His body on the cloth.                                                                             regards

lobbies and pedophilia so there is no time left for him to read anything  credible about the Shroud.I have talked with priests who know almost nothing about the Shroud and to make things worse don’t show any interest to get any kind of knowledge.JUst for the record  I know a priest who is also a historian-BUT HE KNOWS ALMOST NOTHING ABOUT THE SHROUD-who categorically denies the Shroud’s authenticity and even scoffs on the issue!!!!So this Pope’s attitude does not surprise me at all if he really has doubts on the Shroud’s authenticity.Nevertheless what is important is not the Pope’s

THIBAULT HEIMBURGER AND OTHER SHROUD SCHOLARSI regret reading a previous comment crticizing Dr.Thibault Heimburger (and other shroud scholars) for doing research allegedly outside their field of expertise.Does knowlege have rigid boundaries?I can be a medical doctor and also have the skill to drive a fast race car in automobile race without being a professional pilot.Dr. Thibault Heimburger is a medical doctor (like myself) and so he undoubtedly has a background in microscopy, physics and chemistry, I recall that some medical doctors specialize in Biochemistry and are teatchers in Medical Schools.After reading attentively his papersI I get the idea that he has indeed a great knowlege in microscopy, physics and chemistry,, much greater than mine.His papers analyzing microscopical, chemical and physical aspects of the Shroud in a comprehensive way, gather overwhelming data to discard once and for all McCrone’s painting image theory, AND SCORCH THEORY.Nevertheless I eagerly wait reading his new paper on his  new reaearch on the Scorch issue.Dr. Thibault Heimburger is an outstanding Shroud researcher who is seeking the scientific truth unlike  pseudo Shroud researchers who get in kitchen lab experiments only to mislead readers of this wonderful blog.Dr. Kelly Kearse is another good example of a Shroud researcher who has given a great contibution to Shroud studies.His detailed studies on Blood issue enables us to conclude that the «blood stains» on the Shroud were produced by contact with a human body and not just a primate, and he also explained in a previous post why Dr. Charles Freeman’s statement that AB blood appeared only about 900A.D. WAS WRONG,This is extremely important because if Shroud blood was only about 1000 years old despite many other facts, the Shroud could not be authentic ( could not have wrapped Jesus body).He debunked in a comprehensive way this theory presenting for example, archeological findings of  2000 years old AB blood mummies found in Israel and statements from experts who are in total disagreement with D’Adamos’ diet theory.He also explained on a genetic and molecular basis why the A gene appeared first than O gene,, and human AB blood group is much older than 900A.D. as had been claimed.Till then nobody had solid arguments to disprove that theory !I apologize for not mentioning ALL Shroud researchers who are doing excellent and honest research and contributing with their papers and presentaions to the advances in Sindonology, although a bit outside their field of expertise                                                                                   regards                                                                    Antero de Frias Moreira                                                                (Centro Português de Sindonologia)","date":"April 5, 2014 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/am-i-the-only-one/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Am I the only one?"}],"pollen":[{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Concerning this post on the pollen question namely the misidentification of Gundelia Tournefoetii species versus «Carduus» I invite commenters to re-read the interesting post on this issue on Dr. Stephen Jones’ Blog titled «Did Max frei Misidentify Carduus Argentatus Shroud Pollen as Gundelia Tournefortii?http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.pt/2008/11/did-max-frei-misidentify-carduus.htmlIt’s worth reading it                                                                   regards                                                           Antero de Frias Moreira","date":"September 14, 2015 at 2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/13/doubting-the-pollen-evidence/","cat":"science","title":"Doubting the Pollen Evidence"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"The Pollen Scam?

Perhaps authenticists cannot use the Pollen evidence as a very «strong» one for establishing an exact geographical trail of the Shroud but skeptics cannot use these problems with pollens to dismiss the Shroud’s authenticity or claim an european mediaeval origin either.So it turns out that the importancet of Professors Fanti and Lucotte’s studies (remember that the last one also mentioned the finding of mineral particles from a desertic soil) was to grant the possibility that the Shroud had been in Plalestine during a period of it’s existence.Were not these important papers, with all the controversy(possibly unjustified) on the Pollens, even the fact that the Shroud had been in the Middle East would be challenged by the skeptics.                                                                                                   regards                                                                                      Antero de Frias Moreira                                                                               Centro Português de Sindonologia","date":"November 10, 2015 at 2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/10/the-pollen-scam/","cat":"science","title":"The Pollen Scam?"}],"researchers":[{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"This is a very informative video nevertheless one thing puzzles my mind.There is correspondence between bloodstains on the occipital areas of the Sudarium and the Shroud as overlays allow us to conclude.But the question is: Was the helmet of thorns removed trom the head of the Man of the Shroud  while He was hanging dead on the cross and before the Sudarium was placed?It seems to me that this question has not yet been discussedWhat do you think?                                                                                      regards                                                                       Antero de Frias Moreira                                                                 Centro Português de Sindonologia","date":"October 27, 2015 at 4:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/26/dan-spicer-we-have-a-simple-explanation/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Dan Spicer:  We have a simple explanation."},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Dear Dr. Hugh FareyYou wrote an interesting observation on serum halus and U.V. photographs nevertheless I feel compelled to comment on another issue.you wrote« both red ochre and vermillion were found, both by Heller and Adler and McCrone.

I should like a professionally competent based response to that question.»From a motor point of view peripheral nervous system I mean peripheral nerves can have motor effects on muscle independently from Central Nervous System either in pathological conditions- I recall for example Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  which causes medullar anterior horn cell degeneration and this condition causes involuntary fascicullations of muscles, or  by external stimuli applied on peripheral nerves which is the condition under analysis.Actually, Barbet experiments were not on nerve cells but the effects of a noxious stimulation (a kind of mechanical parcial injury on the axons of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel of the wrist).Obviously I have never done such an experiment, nevertheless our therapeutic techniques on disabled patients namely cerebrovascular hemiplegic patients and paraplegic patiens who have no Central Nervous System command on medullar anterior horn motor neuron cell can benefit from electrical stimulalion applied to peripheral nerves- that’s myelin axon stimulation- to obtain a non voluntary functional muscle contraction.If we consider a severed limb for reimplantation, at room temperature muscles degenerate after about six hours, but peripheral nerves still function because axon Wallerian degeneration begins just about 3 or 4 days after the injury ( This conclusion is applied to the living patient, there is no such information for amputated limbs nevertheless it’s not unreasonable to think that survival interval can be a little shorter)But what really matters is that a nerve stimulation of a freshly amputated limb can produce a muscle contraction independently from Central Nervous System control                                                                         regards                                                        Antero de Frias Moreira                                                ( Centro Português de Sindonologia )","date":"July 30, 2015 at 8:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Boa tarde LouisNão disponho de seu endereço electónico;pode contactar por favor fazendo um comentário para http://www.santosudariodeturim.blogspot.com.

Response can be twofold: the extracellular matrix, for example, is a conductor of mechanical forces but its structure and composition is also influenced by the cellular responses to those same applied or endogenously generated forces.[8] Mechanosensitive ion channels are found in many cell types and it has been shown that the permeability of these channels to cations is affected by stretch receptors and mechanical stimuli.[9] This permeability of ion channels is the basis for the conversion of the mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal..» https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology)I admit that during Dr.Barbet’s experiments with amputated arms a mechanical stimulus on the median nerve occured when part of the nerve was crushed by the nail piercing the wrist in the carpal tunnel so theorethically a muscle contraction of some thenar muscles would be possible.Obviously law and ethics now preclude such experiments so we must rely on Dr.Barbet’s honesty describing the results and frankly I see no reason for doubting him                                                                             regards                                                            Antero de Frias Moreira                                                       Centro Português de Sindonologia","date":"July 31, 2015 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"To Anoxie«In order to directly study the mechanical stimulation of crushing, Barbet should have crushed the median nerve in the forearm, not in the wrist just beside/through the ligament and the carpal bones.»What is the anatomic basis to support such assertion?I see none.«Obviously you can take a freshly amputated limb from a rabbit or a cow, and squeeze/brush/pierce the sciatic nerve for example, at distance from an articulation.»Obviously that’s a different condition namely different species and different muscle groups involved and besides such experiments are a cruelty to animals and I won’t perform them.                                         regards                          Antero de Frias Moreira","date":"July 31, 2015 at 1:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Interesting paper indeed I’ll keep it, but there is a little caveatThe hands of the crucified in the image on the Shroud ARE NOT IN THE SO CALLED ICONIC CLENCHED POSITION this was rather seen in artistic depictions  so these theorethical considerations CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THE SHROUD.If I had to bet between Professor Zugibe and Dr.Pierre Barbet’s hypothesis on this issue I’d choose Dr.Barbet’s hypothesis on wrist nailing, median nerve nociceptive mechanical stimulation and position of the thumb.Actually NOTHING FROM ANATOMY AND PERIPHERAL NERVE PHYSIOLOGY CAN DISMISS DR.

Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Just now I have some time to comment on this issue…The theory of right shoulder dislocation is not new but I was surprised by the possibility of associated brachial pexus palsy.The most prevalent variety of shoulder dislocation-the anterior- often occurs when patients fall sustaining  their weigth by hand contact with the ground in external rotation/extension of the arm, or by a sudden movement of extreme arm abduction-extension-external rotation of the shoulder.If the Man of the Shroud had His superior limbs in an abducted shoulder position due to «rigor mortis» i before being removed from the cross, an applied force to put them in an adduction position as we see on the Shroud would  hardly result in anterior shoulder dislocation it would rather produce perhaps a frature of the superior part of the Humerus or the Glenoid cavity.The inferior  shoulder dislocation variety is extremely rare and  before orthopedic reduction, the patient presents with an irreductible elevated arm.(I have  observed it once only in my 33 year medical practice in a patient for rehabilitation…) so this situation is easily discarded by observing superior limbs position of Shroud image.Concerning the second pathological condition mentioned- Brachial Plexus Injury- a trauma involving a violent stretch of the cervical spine and scapular girdle  as it could happen in a fall without hand protection, or a torture aggression,  could in theory be responsible for a lesion  involving superior roots of the Brachial  Plexus maybe including the seventh cervical root, but complete Brachial Plexus injuries are characteristic of high velocity/high impact trauma as the ones in motor vehicle accidents namely motorcycles.The condition known as Claude-Bernard-Horner syndrome may be present only in complete (C5-C6-C7-C8-D1) lesions of the Brachial Plexus, and results from sympahetic cervical nervous system injury clinically producing a reduced ocular opening by ptosis of superior eyelid and apparent enophtalmos  and a reduced pupilar diameter.(myosis).Bearing in mind all this and observing the Shroud Image my opinion as a medical doctor dealing with injured patients is as follows:If the Man of the Shroud suffered traumatic injuries from torture and falling to the ground without hand protection an anterior dislocation of the right or left shoulder is a plausible possibility,the same applies to injury of the Brachial Plexus, but it would be extremely uncommon a complete paralysis of the superior limb, and Claude Bernard Horner syndrome does not immediatly appear and besides as far as I know it is a condition observed in the living person and not in a corpse.Now let’s analyze the Shroud Image:We’re facing a real problem because there is no shoulder or  arm image on both sides because those areas were destroyed by Chambery’s 1532 fire.Even if the right shoulder area was there I think we could hardly discern the clinical signs of anterior shoulder dislocation.The fact that right forearm is longer than letft and has a length apparently out of proportion with anatomy does not necessarily mean that the shoulder is dislocated.This observation can be explained by the position of right superior limb relative to the left and the way image was produced on the cloth, perhaps tensile forces applied to the fabric and unknown factors- image experts advice on this issue would be welcome.Now ,looking at right eye area ,we observe a closed eyelid ,periorbital oedema and swelling of the cheek area of the face. all these findings can be explained by the severity of blunt traumas the Man of the Shroud endured and I agree with Dr. Thibault Heimburger that a fracture of the orbital part of the malar bone could produce such an aspect, so Claude Bernard Horner syndrome is perhaps a far fetched possibility.To summarize ,and with due respect to the authors of the paper under comment , my humble opinion is that stating that the Man of the Shroud had a dislocated right shoulder  and a paralysis of the brachial plexus is very hard to prove indeed  based  only on visual image analysis, and pathophysiology of those injuries.                                                                regards                                                           Antero de Frias Moreira

one of Xabregas in my country, nevertheless just by observing these paintings frankly I don’t find enough criteria to make a diagnosis of right anterior shoulder dislocation.( what you called «luxation glenoidea» ).Actually the assimetry in shape of the shoulders and arm lenght is probably a technical painting imperfection and I think those bizarre depictions of the Shroud of Turin could never express the details of the original and ,much less show the clinical signs of shoulder dislocation.As you know the diagnosis of shoulder dislocation although with high accuracy clinical suspicion, can only be surely stated by radiograph exam and we do not have an X-Ray exam of the Man of the Shroud’s right shoulder….I did not deny  categorically the possibility that the Man of the Shroud suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder what I meant is there is no evidence of such condition on the Shroud of Turin.Don’t get me wrong,, this is just a medical and technical detail that

scientific aspects of the Shroud of Turin is backed by the conclusions of honest scientists who studied the Shroud of Turin and the Sudarium of Oviedo.Actually the painting of a naked Christ was absolutely unusual in medieval art(most of historian arts agree with this), the blood marks on the Shroud are consistent with contact with a body that sustained the horrors of scourging, crowning with a helmet of thorns and crucified with nails on the wrists (not the palm) and had his side pierced with a spear – THESE ARE EVIDENCES PRESENTED BY FORENSIC EXPERTS, NOT SPECULATIONS.The question pf pollens is a bit more complex due to difficulties in taxonomical classification of pollen grains, namely ancient samples collected by Dr. Max Frei nevertheless there are pollens on the Shroud that allow us to conclude that it had been in the Middle East possibly in Palestine.New studies on contaminating human DNA and plant DNA from dust vaccuumed from the Shroud ( by Professor Fanti and an enlarged team of italian geneticists) coroborate the known historical Shroud trail.NO doubt blood marks on the occipital area area of the head image of the Shroud match the ones on the Sudarium of Oviedo, and this is not a matter of faith it’s enough to compare the photos side by side..This is a subject that cannot be denied and recent studies by Centro Español de Sindonologia support this conclusion, and besides this fact is a classical argument against he validity of the infamous 1988 radiocarbon tests.You must be aware that skeptics always try to deceive us denying evidences and

misleading.I wion’t discuss every issue but if it’s true that nailing in the wrist like the Shroud image has till now no archaeological back-up that’s easy to explain because carpal bones are small size and age effects namely separation and bone erosion would preclude or make very difficult to determine bone erosions due to nailing.Nevertheless I read somewhere that archaelogists found remains of a forearm with bone aspects of nailing through the distal radius and ulna near the first range of carpal bones.And you should also remember that Dr. Pierre Barbet conducted experiences with amputated arms and cadavers and concluded that it’s impossible to sustain a body on the cross by nailing through the palms.In my humble opinion as a medical doctor with anatomical knowledge the exit wound on the dorsal image of the left wrist matches the so called Destot’s space between lunate triquetrum capitatum and hamatum wrist bones(not the palm/metacarpal area)«The artist need not have known anything about negatives and 3D, which effects are inevitable consequences of the visualisation of an image made by a body on a cloth. »Gimme a break….I think that when you wrote tridimensional coding you meant an image with volumetric/tridimensional encoding that when submitted to 3D computer analysis unveils a human body with reasonable anatomic accuracy ,These image properties were verified in the Shroud Image by different image processing programs, not just with the VP-8.Notice that obtaining relief in relation with darker or lighter image areas IS NOT THE SAME AS 3D ANATOMOAL ACCURACYBurn holes appear different than surrrounding non burned areas of the Shroud in VP-8 image analysis as expected nevertheless this fact has nothing in common with the details and reasonable anatomical exactness of the body image.If producing a Shroud like image by a «body on cloth» was that easy there would be «many shrouds»…. My reply ends here because those other issues have already been studied by qualified experts as you know.                                                                               regards                                                              Antero de Frias Moreira                                                    Centro Português de Sindonologia","date":"May 15, 2015 at 11:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/13/too-great-to-be-a-work-of-art/","cat":"article","title":"Too Great to Be a Work of Art"},{"author":"antero_de_frias_moreira","post":"Why are you so unfair with Professor Fanti?Professor Fanti has the merit to have developed a new non destructive ancient textiles dating method, and has published his methodology in a respected scientific journal I mean Vibrational Spectroscopy.As far as I Know his new method along with Professor Roger’s degradation kinetics of vanillin loss are the only alternative scientific ways to date Shroud fibers.People interested on the scientific study of the Shroud should feel grateful to his commitment to the Shroud and Shroud Science Group.I feel honored to praise Professor Giulio Fanti as the great scientist he his and  for his excellent  contributions to Shroud science.

cause) or secondary hyperuricemia this situation occurs for exemple when there is increased cell turnover breakdown as in lymphomas and leukemia or chemotherapy of malignant diseases.Normouricemic people seldom develop uric acid calculi and although extrreme dehydration would be a precipitating condition for uric acid crystals formation and aggregation and stone formation it would take time for that to occur and we cannot exactly know how long would it take.And why not calcium oxalate crystals?Uric acid nephroitiasis no doubt could cause ureteral spasms with excruciating lumbar pain if it really happened during the hours preceding Jesus death on the cross, and it would be an addicional cause of suffering. nevertheless for acute renal failure to occur, urine flow had to be completely compromised by obstruction of both ureters.Acute failure can be a primary cause of death but it will not kill the patient in a few hours.If this surmised renal failure was another cause contributive to the death of the Man of the Shroud in my modest opinion as a physician I think hypovolemic schock caused by scourging wounds, dehydration «per se» and neurogenic autonomic system disfunction by the extreme sufferings were the possible main causes, not obstructing renal calculi.But even if renal function impairment occured it would be a serious adverse clinical condition but not a direct cause of death.The death of the Man of the Shroud was caused mainly by asphixia hastened by muscle disfunction because of a state of impaired blood flow due to hypovolemic schock.I grant there are other possibilities as myocardial infarction or cardiac arithmia but this is my humble opinion.                                                                 regards

results confirmed a previous dating from the seventh century A.D.although this was not a surprise at all for scientists of Centro Español de Sindonologia because it is well known that the Sudarium has a high level of contamination.When I attended 2012 Valencia Shroud Congress I remember to listen to a presentation by a member of Centro Español de Sindonologia who explained those results because there was enrichment of the fabric with new C14 from tiny carbonaceous particles stuck to the fibers which could not be removed in cleaning pre dating procedures.Actually he showed interesting images where everyone could see those tiny black spots stuck to the fibers, as he explained resulting from previous fire in the cathedral.I got the idea that a correct radiodating of Oviedo Sudarium was thus impossible.This is all I can share with you.I think this paper is entitled «Dating the Cloth by C14 Method-The Oviedo Sudarium by Felipe Montero Ortega but it’s not available perhaps the Magazine
