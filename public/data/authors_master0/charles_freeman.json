Quite apart from the mistaken belief that this was a shroud, the fact that the  pattern was stepped pyramids and not herringbones and that the holes were circular and that the L went the wrong way for a copy of the ragged and uneven poker holes, for some inexplicable ( well to me at least) reason this became a bandwagon from which it it seems impossible to pull some people off.No matter that there would be no reason to depict the poker holes but not the images.  No matter that depictions of cloth relics, such as the hundreds of cases where cloths with the living face of Christ ( Edessa, Veil of Veronica and others) are always shown with the images intact by the artist. Here the artist has struck out on his own and produced a Shroud of Turin WITHOUT the double images that distinguish it from the other Shrouds being displayed as relics of the burial in this period. No matter that there were circular  holes drilled into the Sepulchre in the tenth or eleventh century ( the sources seem to differ on the date  but they were there for all the Crusaders to see at the time of the First Crusade (1099, capture of Jerusalem) and thousands of crusaders would have flooded back to Europe with the knowledge that there were circular holes in the sepulchre  which by the twelfth century had become part of the iconography). No matter that it would have been virtually impossible at this date for a heretical Catholic to get into the Byzantine imperial relic collections. No matter, no matter.And all to suggest that the Shroud was around, as were many other ‘burial shrouds’, by 1195.I do believe that anyone who swallows this is dreaming. Much of the debate seems to rest on the conviction that this IS the Shroud WHATEVER and so there MUST be some explanation for every piece of evidence that this NOT the Shroud.P.S. Those who have read Beldon Scott’s major study of the Shroud will know that the holes from the fire of 1532 did become an object of veneration in the belief that the fire had miraculously stopped or been stopped without damaging the sacred images. This, according to Beldon Scott, is why they  were always depicted with such care by artists.

I don’t favour any one theory over another, other than the probability, rising from my own work on relic cults, that the Shroud is medieval.   My point in all my contributions is to highlight areas where the evidence does not stack up. The fact that all you can now say about the lower register of the Pray Codex is that the illustrator ‘hints at the [Shroud] symbolically’ says it all to me- why should he not just show it- as other illustrators show the Images of Edessa and Veil of Veronica -why the secrecy? ‘Hints’ are not good enough and we are concerned with the Shroud AFTER the Resurrection not BEFORE as shown in the upper register. We have lots of examples of Christ’s body being laid out- I have been communicating with a US scholar who has done extensive work on this.  The Pray Codex is an excellent example of its time in showing no flowing wounds while  a hundred years later these wounds, still bleeding, are beginning to be illustrated in these scenes. The blood on the Shroud (and I am being neutral here) is either because it is blood from an actual body or because it is somehow related to the blood cults of the thirteenth /fourteenth centuries.    I am also trying to highlight the many areas of research that still remain to be examined so far as the Shroud is concerned, notably the documented trade/import (including the Crusades) of relics directly from Jerusalem (even from ‘the Lords’ tomb’)  to northern France.It may well be that relevant documentation is lost but to dismiss this area of research altogether is simply unscholarly (might I even say ‘narrow?’). On what grounds do you reject it as not even worthy of further examination, especially as it is not incompatible with the possible authenticity of the Shroud?    One of the major problems is that there are all too many shrouds out there all claiming to be the real thing and this is why I only would accept depictions or descriptions of a Shroud depicted with a double image as evidence of the one which is now known as the Shroud of Turin. One must also remember that we have documented examples of thousands of painted linens used in churches for various ceremonial purposes (and never claimed as relics) and this complicates research still further.As an old-fashioned historian trained in a particular way to examine and assess evidence, I have to admit to finding Max incomprehensible – in a class entirely of his own!","date":"June 20, 2014 at 4:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/12/navy-seals-at-the-battle-of-gettysburg-a-picture-of-the-shroud-in-1036/","cat":"art","title":"Navy Seals at the Battle of Gettysburg?

(I suspect Hugh is in the same camp as I am.). The presentations at the St. Louis conference suggest that research is stagnant and largely repetitive. What is likely is that the solution to the ‘ mystery’ of the Shroud will come from outside the Shroud community probably from someone working on other linen artefacts, medieval or  earlier, or iconography. There seems no awareness in the Shroud community as to just how much expertise on things like medieval linens and a ancient weaving techniques h ave moved on. Many are still stuck in the technology of 1978 as if that decided the composition of the Shroud and its images for all time.With research within the Shroud community so stagnant it seems likely that someone who has had nothing to with the Shroud,  will come up with some evidence, probably relating to some other issue, that convinces the wider world for or against the authenticity of the Shroud.

In the Middle Ages there were a lot of artefacts , usually made for a religious purpose, that somehow acquired an aura of sanctity or  were associated with miracles. They became objects of veneration and accepted by the Church as such, even earning indulgences. A good example is the fifteenth century banner of the Virgin Mary protecting the people of Perugia from plague, still on show in the Oratory of San Bernardino in Perugia. When paraded it became associated with the cessation of plague and so an indulgence could be gained by visiting it.The Church’s view from the 1390s, certainly to this day as endorsed by pope Francis, is that the Shroud has achieved ‘object of veneration’ status but no more than this, which is why in the 1390s there was no attempt  to stop it being  exposed at Lirey when it was still in the church there. (If the Church had believed it was an out and out forgery,they would not have allowed continued display.)When I read that the Shroud is either a deliberate forgery or authentic,  I insert  the third, and to me most likely possibility, is that it was made for some other religious purpose, achieved status possibly through causing (unrecorded) miracles, and then crossed the line between icon and relic, as Kennedy ,et. al. claim in the introduction to their edition of  de Charny’s Chivalry. The Church authorities were simply pushing it back where it belonged without undermining its status as an object of veneration.As i have said before the Shroud of Besancon seems to have been in the same category as there is an  account that it was associated with the revival of a dead man.

What is fascinating is the two earliest depictions we have of the Shroud with the loincloth are with Borromeo presiding as the central figure in 1578 and Francesco Lamberti, bishop of Nice,  presiding in the Carlo Malliano engraving of 1579. Lamberti was one of the signatories of the 1563 Trent ban on lascivia which involved the covering up of nude religious figures, as was the fate of Michelangelo’s Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel. Borromeo was the papal secretary in 1563 and heavily involved in Trent as well and was obsessed about covering up nude art when he became Archbishop of Milan. I don’t think either would have been seen holding up a nude body of Christ! And seeing how relics were cut up, shared around, closed off in reliquaries, etc, there would have been no impropriety in adding on a loin cloth- in fact greater impropriety in leaving the figure exposed at the height of the Catholic Counter-Reformation.But lots still to be researched on the iconography of the Shroud loincloths!There does seem to be  a line along the bottom third of the Cloth but really the whole thing is too indistinct  and the way the left hand legs are painted is so different from the other images that I don’ t know of anything can be made of it.

Reflections of an arrogant and aloof English historian.   The idea that the Shroud can be seen in the Pray Codex has always seemed to me absurd as the Shroud is not highlighted, there no sign of the distinctive two images and Christ is shown without bleeding wounds as he is laid out making it impossible for him to transfer blood to the shroud in which he was wrapped.  The pose of Jesus reflected ordinary burials and was increasingly common in art at this time so no surprises here. Again a decorated tomb lid is hardly unique (see below). Perhaps if I stood far off and took my glasses off I could see a similarity between the stepped pyramid  and a herringbone pattern, but close up, as the illustrator would have been working, this link is clearly impossible to make.Se we need to explain a stone or marble coffin lid with circular holes in it. The answer comes from Jerusalem. The tomb of the Holy Sepulchre was originally left as a rock tomb  and in Byzantine representations of the entombment or Resurrection it was always shown like this.  However in the first half of the tenth century, the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII covered the tomb with a marble slab but in order for pilgrims to see into it to the original rock he drilled three circular holes, or oculi. From the tenth century in the west , and only in the west, we find artists copying the marble lid and representing the scenes of the Resurrection with a sarcophagus with a lid. In 1099 the Crusaders captured Jerusalem and between then and 1187 it was open to western pilgrims as well as the original crusaders. In the twelfth century the marble lid was increasingly shown with the oculi, two, three or four. William Forsyth gives four  examples from the twelfth century e.g. before or at the same time as the Pray Codex. They are on a capital in the cathedral of Modena, on a relief  at Monte San Angelo (in Foggio, Italy), on a lintel on the south portal of the west façade of Saint Gilles at Arles and on a capital on a portal in Chartres Cathedral. (He goes on to give later ones as well.)As he puts it ( P. 9 of his book on Entombment Sculptures):  ‘ These oculi were known and copied in the west. The association with Christ’s tomb lead to their being placed on the front face of the sarcophagus, the western equivalent of the tomb bench. In some French fourteenth century ivories there holes become elaborately decorated motifs resembling rose windows.’ So when we see a coffin lid with circular holes in it, I think the inspiration for these is clear.But these are French and Italian examples. What do we know of a Hungarian connection with Jerusalem in the second half of the twelfth century? We have a very strong one. In 1169 or 70, King Bella III sent a large sum of gold to Jerusalem for the Knights Hospitallers in Jerusalem to buy land from which to have an income to support the sick. In the document Bella said that he and his wife would be making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and some of the money should be retained to entertain him and his retinue. The Wikipedia entry says that they did make the pilgrimage but there is no reference providedand an earlier study (James Sweeney, Hungary in the Crusades, 1169-1218, International History Review III, October, 198) suggests that they never made it., so I shall leave the question open. However we do know that there was a high-level Hungarian mission sent to Jerusalem with the money. One can assume that they visited the Sepulchre and saw the lid with the oculi in it.Jerusalem was lost in 1187 but Hungarians took part in the ill-fated Third Crusade to reconquer it. (All this is in the Sweeney article.) In 1192 King Ladislaw of Hungary  who had died a hundred years before, was canonised and he was presented as the idea of a warrior crusader knight. The excitement was such that in 1195 or 1196, the ageing Bella vowed he would join the next Crusade to the Holy Land.  He died  in 1196 before he could fulfil this vow but Jerusalem was right at the forefront of everybody’s minds in these years, the years of the Pray Codex.This is from two hours library research in the midst of a busy day doing other things but a stone coffin lid in itself confirms Jerusalem is the model as it appears in art just about the same time Constantine placed one over the tomb and the oculi goes with them. No need to look further, I think.The lesson is if you consider yourself a Shroud researcher, think for yourself and don’t follow Ian Wilson, who seems to have been behind this. The Pray Codex hypothesis.  which never had much going for it, is  surely redundant.

There are more recorded in the west than in the east and it is especially strange that the artist would not want to distinguish it from these by showing the images , bloodstains, and size that everyone would notice at once and know exactly what his aim was..We don’t lose anything by simply saying that there is no real evidence that this is the Shroud.

It will probably be a chance event , like someone working in a conservation lab on medieval linens, who finds some key evidence that can be linked back into what we know of the chemistry of the Shroud and provide a date for it independently of the radiocarbon date. This is what happened with the Horses of St. Mark’s in Venice. No one could date them and the last big study said fourth century BC. Then the conservation lab in the British Museum working on gilded copies found  conclusive evidence that the same technique of gilding on the horses was only developed in the second century AD and the issue was solved overnight. Watch out for the  conservation labs, folks! There are real open- minded experts who specialise in early weaving and images on cloths and it is the failure to make any comparative studies of the Shroud with other surviving textiles which is another enormous gap in what is supposed to be the most thoroughly researched artefact of all time!","date":"June 27, 2014 at 2:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"As I said earlier it does not take much to undermine reasoning of ‘A cat has four legs, a dog has four legs, therefore a cat is a dog’  variety.

It aroused a great deal of ridicule including the following from a website called Faith and Theology:“A conversation yesterday reminded me of Richard Swinburne’s 2003 book, The Resurrection of God Incarnate. Using Bayesian probability and lashings of highfalutin mathematical jargon, Swinburne argues that “it [is] very probable indeed that God became incarnate in Jesus Christ who rose from the dead” (p. 214). His mathematical apologetics for the resurrection boils down to the following argument:The probably of God’s existence is one in two (since God either exists or doesn’t exist).The probability that God became incarnate is also one in two (since it either happened or it didn’t).The evidence for God’s existence is an argument for the resurrection.The chance of Christ’s resurrection not being reported by the gospels has a probability of one in 10.Considering all these factors together, there is a one in 1,000 chance that the resurrection is not true.It’s almost impossible to parody this argument (since in order to parody it, you would have to imagine something sillier – a daunting task!). But let me try:The probably that the moon is made of cheese is one in two (since it is either made of cheese or it isn’t); the probability that this cheese is camembert is also one in two (since it’s either camembert or it isn’t); and so on..”Oxford University Press was assailed for its philosophical naivity in publishing Swinburne’s book and someone wrote in to say that within five hundred yards of where Swinburne was writing  in Oxford there were probably a hundred mathematicians qualified to tell him he was talking nonsense.

Whenever you are challenged on the issue as to why the poker holes and the circular holes on whatever you think they are laid on, don’t marry up  you just say we must expect inaccuracies!!!! Perhaps it is because these are NOT the poker holes.If  you look front on at the poker holes on the Shroud they do not present an L shape in the same pattern as on the Pray Codex. This is why I am wondering whether you do not mean the top layer of the poker holes but a lower one down. As you know they diminish the further into the folded cloth that you go but when the Shroud is fully extended you can just see them all so we cannot be sure which of the four the your artist has picked out to reproduce.over to you to tell us what you think -or perhaps if the artist is inaccurate anyway it doesn’t.’t matter but it makes your argument even weaker than it already is.         I have asked Nabber to actually show the examples of circular holes that he seems to know about, but he hasn’t. These are the examples that William Forsyth, an expert on sculptures, know represent the oculi in Jerusalem. If Nabber is right that these are sometime reproduced in a greater number than three then there are no problems with there being four Jerusalem oculi on the tomb lid but we do need to see his examples. My suspicion , that Nabber can prove unfounded, is that he actually has not seen the originals. This is because from what limited information I actually put into my posting, it would take some time to actually go through all the sculptures concerned to pick out Forsyth’s examples. I know both the cathedrals at Chartres and Modena and both have a wealth of sculpture to pick through and it is difficult, from my preliminary searches in a university library ,to find a full set of photographs.

I shall look forward to your  (and to anyone else’s) choice of the poker holes.The basic argument is that we have a shroud with two images, apparently unique as I know of no other examples, which was heavily bloodstained but we see absolutely no sign of its size, the images or bloodstains in the Pray Codex. The artist has not even shown the wounds of Christ without which the bloodstains could not have soaked into the Shroud. All this when,as depictions of relics such as the Image of Edessa show, artists had no inhibitions about representing painted cloths as they appeared to be. We have documentary accounts of the marble lid placed over the rock tomb in the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre and eye -witness reports of oculi in the lid. There is nothing in the Pray Codex, other than its inept artistry, that is outside conventional depictions of these scenes. However, there does seem to be a particular concentration on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre/crusader crosses that ties in with the crusading hysteria that apparently swept Hungary in the mid- 1190s after the loss of Jerusalem in 1187.We need to get together all the examples from the twelfth century onwards that Forsyth provides to see whether we can say anything coherent from them about the positioning of the oculi in the marble lid that is illustrated in the Codex as the original is lost. Much though I would love to go and visit all these places . . .  I can see from photographs of the fine Romanesque sculptures of Modena where the scene with the tomb is but alas it is not close up enough for me to see the oculi. I have no reason to doubt an expert such as Forsyth who has no axe to grind on this issue.Nabber tells us that he has examples of four or more  oculi but we wait on him to provide them. If he is right that there are cases of four oculi then that is an argument in my favour but I suspect that as none of his are on a tomb he is looking at the wrong images so I am not counting on him for support.So there is absolutely no reason to read the Shroud into the Pray Codex. This is a simple argument, very typical of those made by art historians every day of the week. You have to find some firm foundation stones from which to build an argument and a vague reference to what you say admit inaccurate representations of a defect in a holy relic by an artist whom you admit had no intention of representing the Shroud in the first place are simply not good enough in the real world of academia. It is up to you go on abusing me if that is your way of conducting discussions.And all this to ‘prove’ the existence of a particular burial shroud of Christ which may, like many of its rivals ‘genuine’ burial shrouds of Christ, have been made in the medieval period but in this case before 1195 (e.g. Cadouin has now been dated through its calligraphy to 1095).","date":"June 30, 2014 at 12:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"But the L is the wrong way round compared to the image on the coffin lid ( I am sorry but  this lid really cannot be the Shroud itself unless it had a dose of starch at the moment of the Resurrection!) and the poker hole going out to the right is not a circle.

Actaeon was torn apart by hounds when he saw Diana bathing. Apparently the mutilated body of a man killed in his prime became equated with Christ. Wertzmann shows a sarcophagus (from the Louvre)  of a naked  Actaeon being laid out in a very similar pose to many Lamentation scenes and sees this as an important source from the tenth century in both east and west ,when there was a renewed interest in copying classical iconography for New Testament texts.

I have said clearly that I don’ think that the artist depicting the crumpled shroud or sudarium shown on the coffin lid was actually doing any more than reproducing what he had read in the gospels but he may have had a particular shroud, perhaps one of the vanished ones, in mind. There were lots to choose from.My point is clear – if we have perhaps twenty five ‘genuine’ burial shrouds from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries, a date for the  Turin shroud of before 1195 may mean no more than it is from an earlier medieval group rather than a later one. I prefer to forget the radiocarbon date and work to find other means of placing the Shroud.

Just look at the Codex with its laying out of Christ in a pose already represented in the west before this . No obvious similarities – or is the earlier laying out scene in the Klosterneuberg  monastery example ( Austria) with crossed arms also based on the Shroud?And after all this, the Pray Codex does nothing either way to show that the Shroud is first century – even if it is there, it only says that it might have been made before 1195.","date":"July 7, 2014 at 3:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"One thing that has been underestimated or ignored in this debate is the degree to which an object which is not considered a relic is still accepted as an object of veneration.In the east, this was ,of course, typical of most icons, except for the few of the Virgin and Child that were considered to have been hand painted by Luke. So far as the Catholic Church is concerned the Shroud is a classic example. The Church authorities believed that it was a cloth on which the images had been painted but they still authorised it as an object of veneration – even when it was still in situ in Lirey.

The question is why. It certainly shows that the Church regards it as more than a mere forgery. The question is what it believed it to be in the 1390s.The question is also at what point it was first venerated. Kennedy’s introduction to his book on de Charny’s Chivalry suggests that it was an icon that Jeanne de Charny transformed into a relic while her husband was away on campaign. A possibility certainly and this would imply an earlier tradition of veneration. So my point so far as THIS posting is concerned is that even if, and I can see no sign of it, the Pray Codex showed the Shroud, it may mean no more that it had achieved the same status as hundreds of other icons.Are you saying that the papal document allowing the Shroud to be exhibited by Geoffrey de  Charny II at Lirey on condition that it was announced beforehand that it was not a genuine relic  does not exist or is a forgery or that such expositions did not take place? This seems to me to be the first document that sets in place the attitude the Church has had to the Shroud ever since and later documents fall within this tradition.  The point is that here the Church asserted firmly that it was NOT the genuine burial shroud. No sitting on the fence here as you suggest.But I agree that the fundamental question as to why the Church accepted the veneration of the Shroud in the 1390s and did not condemn it as a forgery does need separate discussion ,not least to overthrow the old dichotomy that that Shroud must either be authentic or a forgery. Clearly the Church did not believe it was either and this needs further exploration.","date":"July 7, 2014 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"The basic point has always been that the Shroud shows extensive bloodstains and scourge marks.

The British Museum has one from 1608, the Royal  Library in Turin produced one I had  not seen elsewhere of 1579 and presumably there are others.Add to these should be  the copies of the Shroud, some of which may be faded if they are like the Shroud on cloth.Only when a full database of all these has been assembled and released on the web, will scholars be able to reconstruct how the Shroud images looked originally.Despite all the hype about the Shroud being the most researched artefact in history, these obvious sources of potentially vital evidence have been ignored.","date":"March 8, 2015 at 10:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Julian: Well, just to make my point.

There are fifty-one sub-headings alone in the subject index under ‘Christ, images of’. He takes one style of these images back to ‘eastern Syrian works of the third century ,as in a fresco in Dura- Europos’. Of course, we are severely limited by the mass destruction of eastern images of Christ in the iconoclastic period. So, for instance we have a reference ( p. 62, Belting) to the usurper emperor  Heraclius (AD  610) finding in Constantinople ‘the already existing cult of an unpainted image of Christ which he made his own; – he took it with him on campaign. This may have been the same image of Christ that had been discovered in a garden well in the village of Kamuliana in Asia Minor and brought to Constantinople in 574. It showed off its power by miracles in the village where it was found (including duplicating itself when pressed to the finder’s dress), before it was sent to Constantinople. Where did it go?Of course other historians have noted the importance of the representation of the emperors in Roman art as a model for  the seated fully frontal Christ ‘ Subsequent [in this case after 350] depictions of the all-powerful Christ in the apses and cupolas of Christian churches retain the iconographic elements of emperors of late antiquity’, as another authority on early Christian art, Johannes Deckers, puts it. Again the painted Roman coffin lids of Egypt , many of which have survived, are also seen as a source of painted icons- they too show living faces as do all the early images of Christ.Belting shows how complex and varied the sources of the iconography of images of Christ are. Many of them are secular ‘templates’ adopted in Christian art well before the sixth century. The idea that images of Christ are all taken from a single piece of cloth in the SIXTH century has never had anything going for it- the traditions are much older.","date":"September 7, 2012 at 4:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘As the sun does not need the lamplight, so also the church of the congregation can do without the remains of the martyrs, It is sufficient to venerate the name of Christ, for the Church is his bride, redeemed by his blood’. Basil of Caesarea  was one of the great theologians of the late fourth century and he spelled out the reasons why relics were not be specially venerated. He is echoed a few years later in the Latin church by Augustine who says miracles are no longer needed now the Church is well established and decries the custom already in place of hawking around relics for sale. By the end of his life ,however, Augustine is as keen on relics and miracles as anyone else. So ,just as in the Protestant church today, early Christians did not venerate relics and it is a much later phenomenon, essentially only appearing 300 , yes 300, years after the events of the gospels. There are a few reports from the late third century of martyrs’ bodies being venerated and then in the 320s we have the finding of the True Cross by Helena in Jerusalem. By the 380s we have Jerome wandering around the Holy Land and finding many of the relics such as the manger in which Jesus lay. By 420 relics are everywhere in the Christian world and once it was accepted that any part of a relic had the power of the whole, bodies could be divided up and distributed. That is why one finds parts of the first martyr Stephen in both eastern and western parts of the empire by 420. We have lots of documentary evidence by now of what the major relics were and where they were venerated. Not a single mention of a burial shroud being venerated as a relic but several legendary accounts in the sixth and seventh centuries of the burial cloths being seen in the tomb e.g in the Acts of Thaddeus, the very same text that Wilson used for tetradiplon  the term which describes the cloth BEFORE Christ wiped his face on it, then the same text goes on to describe the burial cloths in the tomb- so the burial shroud,in this legend, could not be the same cloth as that described as tetradiplon. Then there is Arculf’s account, late seventh century, in which Arculf visits Jerusalem and sees the main burial cloth still in the tomb and recounts the story of the sudarium ,a face cloth, cf.as in the Oviedo example, as a separate cloth. Wilson tells us about the sudarium, assumes that it is the Shroud temporarily moved from Edessa to Jerusalem(!!!) and then,of course, says nothing about the burial cloth in the tomb, in a similar way to the way he omits telling us about the reference to the burial shroud in the Acts of Thaddeus which destroys his argument that the Shroud was tetradiplon.So what are we to do? Does Wilson really believe what he is writing? He is expert at teasing out any text that might ,however many centuries it is after the event, refer to the Shroud but almost certainly doesn’t, but then misses the obvious references to the burial cloths as being in the tomb and being distinct from the Image of Edessa. So, Louis, I do think, in the absence of any documentary evidence , we DO need to find special reasons why the burial shroud would have kept as a relic in an age when relics were not being collected and when , in the age that they were, the fourth/fifth century, there is no mention among all the other relics listed of the veneration of a burial shroud. It clearly was not high profile compared to other relics from the Passion, the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary that are recorded at this time. (One of my concerns about Wilson is that despite writing about the Shroud since 1978, he shows no sign of being aware of the immense documentation about other, much more prestigious, relic cults that still survive from this period.) And even if one argues that it only first appeared to the public as the Image of Edessa, there is no evidence from any of the early texts to suggest that this was anything other than an image that was believed to come from the living face of Christ.","date":"September 9, 2012 at 4:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Dave B . Thanks for yours. Having worked as a historian for all too many years, I am very cautious about sources. This is especially true of relics stories as it was the custom to create stories of where you particular relic came from and why it was genuine. By definition, most of these stories have to be false as not every burial shroud, piece of the cross, Girdle of the Virgin Mary, head of John the Baptist,etc, could be genuine!I can only quote Belting on the Shroud, with page reference,- perhaps he has expanded on his theory elsewhere. i was much more interested in his arguments for the appearance of the Image of Edessa as a newly emerging Image, probably made in the sixth century, as, if he is right, then Wilson’s theory collapses.a) Guscin. No problem here as this is simply a standard account of the Image of Edessa that we know to have been in the emperors’ private chapel, the Pharos Chapel, from 944 to sometime after 1204. Such a precious relic would never have been moved- especially not to a very vulnerable chapel on the seashore.. So there is no link to what de Clari saw in the Blachernae Chapel.b) This is so late and not corroborated by any other account.c). Another late variance on the original Agbar legends ( all LEGENDS, of course, not historical accounts) which can hardly be used to supplant earlier accounts of the legends that say it is just the face.So nothing very convincing here, certainly not enough to overthrow the traditional narrative which best accords with the sources that the Image of Edessa appears for the first time in the sixth century and is then given a legendary history in order to give it credibility. This is the best fit explanation unless we find some more specific documentary evidence. (In these cases where the evidence we would like is missing , we have to end up with a ‘best fit’, always provisional, of course.)As I try and explain  in my original article, Wilson fails completely to find any evidence for the 500 years before  the sixth century and the only ‘evidence ‘ he provides for the Shroud being the same as the Image of Edessa is, as I attempt to point out in my article ‘Tetradiplon Revisited’, rests on the tetradiplon cloth, WITHOUT AN IMAGE, with which Jesus wiped his face, according to the legend,being REFOLDED ‘tetradiplon’, but not a single source says that it was and there is a separate reference to burial cloths in the same text anyway. Wilson simply ignores it but surely he should list every time there is a reference to a burial cloth or cloths in the tomb. I can see why people wonder what his motives are.  Does he really believe what he writes? Is he really satisfied that the evidence he provides  is conclusive? Did he read the full text (here and in other cases) or was he simply being lazy?The distinction between cloths showing a living and a dead Christ is crucial in the context of the iconoclastic debates. The images of a living Christ, the Image of Edessa, the Veil of Veronica, and the image brought to Constantinople in 574, provided evidence that Christ wanted to have images of himself, something the iconoclasts denied. An image of a dead Christ would not help here but i completely fail to buy the view that the Shroud of Turin was somehow made to represent a living Christ. In fact, as I have said before, with reports of various images and shrouds around in both east and west, I know of no clear reference to what we know of the Shroud of Turin before the fourteenth century. As the distinctive element of the Shroud of Turin is a double image, I would expect a clear reference to that, then I WOULD be interested. Up to then caution, caution, caution – Wilson is far too speculative for me and seems completely unaware of the vast amount of material about other relics that we find from the fourth century, when relics appear to have been collected for the first time, that would make him realise that a burial shroud would have been unlikely to have been picked out for special veneration when there was so much else around to venerate.

Your point 2. Many relics simply appear in the historical record- they do not need to have been brought from anywhere although,of course, legends that they have been brought from somewhere often develop.There is a hierarchy of relics, which shifts with time e.g. the Cross is an early fourth century favourite, the bones of Stephen , the first martyr, make a big splash in the early fifth century (both Constantinople and Augustine had parts of him), the Blood of Christ becomes important in late medieval Germany. Burial Shrouds simply don’t get very far in the hierarchy perhaps because of the taboos in showing Christ dead which lasted until  c. 1000. They were simply not something you venerated when there was so much competition from more prestigious relics, and in the case of images, those showing Christ alive.One of Wilson’s many errors is to assume that the Shroud would have been so important that it would have been given special veneration over and above the thousands of other relics of which we have documentary evidence.

I have pointed out cases where Wilson does provide misleading information – for instance, implying the ‘tetradiplon’ comes AFTER the passing of the Shroud to Jesus and so is a later wrapping up,  instead of BEFORE (with no indication that it was folded up again)- see my article on Tetradiplon. Generally it is rather that some texts, for instance, the sermon of Gregarius Referendum, do not say what he and others claim that they says. From what the linguistic  specialists say, the references to the wounds in Gregarius never suggest that these are on the Shroud itself. More generally still, I would say that Wilson reads into texts things that are not there and that he relies too heavily on later texts at the expense of earlier ones.On faces. Yes, the scholarly consensus is that faces were the main form in which these ‘not made by human hands’ cloths appeared in the late sixth century. Belting, Kitzinger and others discuss why it was at this time. As Kitzinger ( and other specialists) seem to agree, the bearded Christ appears in fourth century Rome and so seems to have been adapted from there. On the Memphis example, I would suggest that the Latin ‘effigies’ might well refer to more than just a face.Obviously those who wish to can stay stuck with Wilson’s hypothesis, wonder why no academics take Should research seriously, and turn their backs on other possible ways in which an early relic might have reached Lirey. The trouble is that this will mean that Shroud research becomes a dead subject. No one with any knowledge of Byzantine iconography is likely to be drawn in and no one will start following up any other leads. However, I am clearly talking to a deaf audience which is disappointing as rejecting Wilson does not necessarily reject belief in the Shroud as authentic as Yannick has shown.I was sent the Sign by Penguin to review. Quite apart from De Wesselow’s bizarre explanation for the birth of Christianity, he had, after six years of research, added no material that I had not read elsewhere in secondary research, so I can hardly rate him very highly. I seem to have found more new (e.g. based on primary sources) leads to follow up in three months, see above, than he has in all those years and I am not even trying! Why  when so many people seem fixated by the Shroud is it impossible to find anyone qualified to take the research on?I am bowing out as I am having to prepare for an interview for a programme ‘Biblehunters’ on how how  Christian manuscripts shaped the early church.

As someone who normally has my own work peer -reviewed (by university presses before publication) I know only too well how obscurantist some academics can be, but I see no reason to doubt the overwhelming consensus against Wilson in this instance. However, I will keep an eye open for other leads on the early history of linen cloths with images on them (as recorded in the arid linen-preserving climate at Memphis) and  early relic collections that have come directly to Constantinople and northern France from Jerusalem (even from’ the Lord’s Tomb’). These leads only come up incidentally when I am working on other things but if no one is prepared to ditch Wilson and follow them up, then, as I said before, this will become a dead subject.","date":"September 6, 2013 at 4:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Matthias. Maybe you are not convinced. But I do think that if we are not accepting documents at face value we should say so. So Wilson should have said, perhaps. ‘ I know that tetradiplon is only used to describe the Shroud BEFORE it was unwrapped for Christ to wash his face with it but, as this is a fable, the writer clearly meant that he wrapped it up again in the same way afterwards. As for the mention of burial cloths later in the same text independently of the face cloth, well these are only symbolic burial cloths so let’s not bother about them. And to show how i think the Shroud might have been folded tetradiplon,let’s not bother with the possibility (following other Greek terms using tetra- as a prefix) that it might have meant doubled over to form four sections or, more probably, that it was doubled over four separate times.  I shall provide a picture of the Shroud folded double only three times and I hope you don’t notice because if you do you will realise that a cloth actually folded tetradiplon would go through the face.’I think that fits the way you believe the history of the Shroud should be recreated.","date":"September 9, 2013 at 1:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Hugh, I share your enthusiasm for digging out these things although I am not as interested in relating them to the Shroud in the way you are. I suppose a sceptic would say how can we be sure that the Shroud images are not taken from the iconography of the day rather than the other way round but  I shall leave that to those working specifically in this field. The Pray Codex is certainly not Byzantine and no one can persuade me that the stepped pyramid design on the coffin lid is a herringbone pattern – and I don’t see why anyone would want to copy the weave but not the images on the Shroud ( not shown on the Pray Codex). Count me as a sceptic on this specific issue.I was in touch with someone who has been looking at how images of the Ascent on the Cross were transferred and transformed when they were imported from Byzantium into the west. Not the same subject as the body, of course, but possibly of interest.I hope you can share your findings and convince me that the Edessa/ Shroud confusion has not killed the subject! Whatever conclusions one comes to as to the authenticity of the Shroud, I am convinced that they are two distinct iconographic traditions, each worthy of study in their own right but not to be confused with each other in the way Wilson does.I am sure you know of the 82nd Canon of the Quinisext Council of Constantinople of 692 that recognises the right to depict Christ in human form ‘so that we may perceive through [the image] the depth of the humiliation of God the Word and be led to the remembrance of His life in the flesh, the Passion and His death, and of the Redemption that this brought to the world’. Here is a clear reference to the image being not merely his face while alive but something more substantial, possibly his whole body, shown in death. I think it represents a different iconographic tradition from the Edessa Image. A pity that so much was destroyed by the iconoclasts so that we may never clarify this.","date":"September 6, 2013 at 11:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S.

There is a very good example by Duccio di Buoninsegna, of c. 1318, entitled The Three Marys. I think it is still in the cathedral museum in Siena but will come up under a search. I have seen other examples – there is one in the Museo Sartorio in Trieste for instance – but as showing the lid was quite common these are not always great works of art any more than the Pray Codex is.I stick to the simple rule. Until I see a Shroud with images of Christ’s body on it depicted in a painting from before 1355, then I would not consider it as a depiction of the Shroud whose distinguishing feature in every document referring to it is the images.

Among the vastly more interesting cults of medieval times, it hardly makes an appearance – simply a cult that sprang up in one small church, was condemned by a bishop, a so-called relic that was hawked around a bit and passed on to the Savoy family who DID make it into a post -medieval cult in the seventeenth century. Then it does come back into my attention as it was a major part of court rituals and I was lecturing on Baroque Turin earlier this year so I had to know about it in this context. So when I look at the Pray Codex, I note– a shroud which comes only up to the shoulders of Christ, as with most depictions of the period– crossed arms similar to the iconography of earlier depictions of Christ– no signs of blood on the actual body, a halo instead of a Crown of Thorns ,again typical of this period.– a coffin lid (compare Duccio) with a stepped pyramid design, not herringbone.– a separate cloth, possibly the face cloth mentioned in John, lying on the lid. No signs here again of any image on the cloth.– holes on the coffin lid which go up three , then one to the LEFT. The Shroud marks on the top layer go up three ,then one to the RIGHT.( I suppose this is part of your not being literal but it reminds me of the people who said that the pyramids represented a star pattern,until someone noted that that they had turned the stars  completely the wrong way round ( and that other than the three major pyramids none of the other pyramids fitted).Red stains -mean nothing unless they are on the Shroud.So I see no reason whatever to see the Shroud here,however much you try and argue that the artist has distorted the actual Shroud in some symbolic way. I know of many accurate representations of relics in paintings- look at Carpaccio’s depictions in Venice of the reliquary of the True Cross, but I don’t know any where they are restricting an understanding of a relic to a few by not showing it literally.My frustrations, repeated all too often, is that people go on following or even creating leads for which there is no evidence (and as a result will not win over anyone,especially in the world of academia) when there are so many other leads that no one seems prepared to follow up.","date":"September 9, 2013 at 11:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/31/significant-endorsement-former-anglican-archbishop-of-canterbury-backs-the-shroud-affair/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"Significant Endorsement:  Former Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury backs The Shroud Affair"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"There was also an icon of the Virgin Mary that was used successfully to ward off the attack of 626.Hugh and Mathias, and anyone else interested.

He does have a separate reference to the Mandylion in his description of the Pharos Chapel, in his History,  Chapter lxxxiiiSo we have to look at the other evidence for what happened to the Blachernae Chapel during the sack. The main link is with St. Mark’s in Venice. The Venetians looted a number of icons from the Blachernae Chapel and took them to St. Mark’s. The details are to be found in Hans Belting, op.cit, p.195 ff ,’San Marco in Venice and its Icons ‘ and more recently in Paul Stephenson, The Byzantine World  (2010) Chapter 29, ‘Sacred Space between Constantinople and Venice’, esp. p. 419. Both show the link between icons in St. Mark’s and those in the Blachernae Chapel.So the first place to look for the possible transfer of the Shroud from the Blachernae Chapel would be Venice as we know the Venetians looted from the Chapel. Unfortunately, we do not seem to have a list of what they took and the connection is only known through a study of the icons themselves in Venice.  Even more unfortunately a fire of 1231  in Venice destroyed much of what had been brought from Constantinople so the shroud may well have perished then if they had taken it.One must also remember the immense destruction and chaos in Constantinople in 1204. Try reading the (Byzantine) account of Niketas Choniates if you haven’t already. He shows that there was unrestrained looting by the crusaders and many relics must simply have perished in the flames, especially if they were made of  cloth. Only those in the imperial palace were safe. One can hardly be surprised that many objects known to have been in Constantinople before 1204 are not recorded afterwards.Michael Angold’s The Fourth Crusade has an excellent chapter on what relics were known to have been taken from where and the hierarchy , starting with the cross, then phials of Christ’s blood,etc etc. No mention of a shroud among them (except in the Pharos Chapel in the palace where burial cloths of Christ are said to be of cheap cloth and to have smelt of myrrh). Either the Blachernae Shroud was not considered important enough to list or or  it simply disappeared in the destruction.

The original source Folda gives  is the Gesta Episcoporum Halberstadensum.Professor  Folda goes on to say that he is not sure whether  Conrad got his ‘Shroud and sudarium’ from the Holy Land or Constantinople as we simply have the list of what he came back with. Michael Angold repeats the story ( The Fourth Crusade, p.232) but wonders whether the Conrad was just given ‘tokens’ of these and his other more prestigious relics  by the emperor Baldwin from the collection in the Pharos Chapel as Conrad’s list is very similar to the list of relics we know to have been in the chapel but which were still there in 1205.Obviously it would be interesting to find out whether there was any veneration of a Shroud, and the other relics*, from either Constantinople or the Holy Land in Halberstadt after 1205.* It is important to remember ‘the other relics ‘as in the case of the Sudarium of Oviedo which was discovered alongside a mass of other relics purporting to come from the Passion and Crucifixion but conveniently forgotten in the rush to find the Shroud and only the Shroud.

In addition to Thomas Dale, look at the work of Holger Klein, for instance, which is freely available on his Columbia website. I can’t see how the public showing of a shroud in Constantinople could have as much impact as the actual mass of relics and Byzantine art that came back to Europe after 1204 which people could actually handle and copy. See Klein on ‘Refashioning Byzantium in Venice -1200-1400’ and his exhaustive article on the transfer of relics from east to west from which I got the information of the transfer by the emperor of a piece of the Shroud to Henry IV.Incidentally I find that the treasury at the monastery at Halberstadt still has a paten brought back by Conrad from Byzantium in 1205.I was lecturing on early Byzantine ivories at the Victoria and Albert Museum last year , and there was a fascinating casket that I had not seen before. It was Byzantine but had been found in a monastery in Italy. It was assumed that it must have been one of the treasures that had been brought back in 1204. It was objects such as these that would have provided models to work from, as they certainly did in Venice- it is hard to see how anyone would have been able to record an image on a Shroud within a church that would only have been lit by candles!Once again there is the danger of giving the Shroud a status that it does not seem to have had. Shroud(s) were among among hundreds of relics in Constantinople and certainly not the most prestigious .Every list that does mention a shroud places in down the list behind the Cross, Crown of Thorns and the actual blood of Christ.Parts of John the Baptist also outclassed it.

However, if one thing still remains from Conrad’s expedition to Constantinople in the treasury at Halberstadt it would be useful to see if anything else of his supposed haul is also still there. As you may know the Treasury of St. Mark’s in Venice  still has a section devoted to relics from the Passion of Christ (the same as brought from Constantinople)  but they are hardly mentioned in the guidebooks. So it would be worth looking and seeing what else is in the Halberstadt Treasury. if I am ever that way i shall certainly look in!2) Your comment ‘But I have to say that I’m not aware of a sudarium that would have been sold to St Louis in this mega-transaction. Who knows what happened of this sudarium ? And who can say that it ever existed for sure in Constantinople and could not have been confused with the Shroud of Christ that was there also.’Good point , and one I have been making repeatedly- we simply don’t have enough precise statements about exactly what was where- and the word ‘sudarium’ is often used without a clear reference to the size of cloth that it refers to.  You have done sterling work here in showing how Wilson misuses sources. As I have replied to Art science , there is no documentary evidence which CLEARLY refers to what we know as the Turin Shroud. Perhaps I am just being over-cautious but it was the way i was trained as a historian.2) Your comment ‘IF (note the “IF” because it’s the most important thing here) the inner part of the Shroud of Turin (where we can see the body image and most of the bloodstains) was showed publicly for the very first time in History during the time the Latin crusaders were at the gates of Constantinople in 1203-1204 and that many of these crusaders were able to see this completely unique, gruesome, crude and even scandalous image of a dead and suffering Christ, I’m totally convinced that this sighting would have had definitively a huge influence on the apparition of the Suffering Christ’s icons that first appeared in Europe (think about the Man of Sorrow icon for example that shows many similarities with the image we see on the Shroud!!!) once the crusaders returned home (with probably the Shroud itself with them in their “luggage”!!!!). ‘I agree with the ‘IF” because we only have one record in a marginal comment by one crusader of a shroud with an image. Have you any evidence that anyone else saw this shroud, or that anyone could see blood or suffering on it? Is there any evidence in any of the chronicles of anyone affected by seeing a shroud so that they would have begun a new phase in art . ( One would need to read Professor Folda on this as this is his specialist subject and he is the acknowledged authority on the relationship between what the crusaders brought back and how it affected western art- I haven’t seen his book yet.) Note my earlier suggestion (no more than that) that the first place to look for the transfer of a relic from the Blachernae Chapel would be Venice as the Venetians took icons from the Chapel but, as I have said, most of the relics the Venetians looted were destroyed in the fire in the treasury of 1231 so that even if the Blachernae shroud had escaped the destruction in Constantinople itself, it might have perished in the fire.Anyway the images of the suffering Christ go back much earlier than 1204. I would refer you to Rachel Fulton’s From Judgment to Passion, Columbia UP,2002. While the Gero Crucifix of 970 is normally seen as the first ‘suffering Christ’, I was more moved by the Old English poem Christ III.‘And downcast in soul they shall also behold the ancient gashes and the gaping wounds in their God, even as His foes pierced His white hands and hallowed feet with nails and likewise  made blood run from His side, where blood and water issued forth together  in the sight of all, flowing before the face of men, while he was on the Cross’.If that is not an image of the suffering Christ, probably tenth century, I don’t know what is.You will find many more details of the emergence of the ‘suffering Christ’ in the tenth and eleventh centuries in Fulton’s acclaimed study.I agree with so much of what you have written on Wilson, you have shown how his arguments fail to stand up in any sense at all, so I am sorry I have to disagree with you here!","date":"September 12, 2012 at 11:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Artscience. Well, you have stated one of the reasons that is given for doubting the authenticity of the Shroud, that such a Shroud would have been noticed. Although, as in the case of most relics, we have mentions of  several burial shrouds in Constantinople and in western Europe, not a single one is described as ‘a large cloth with an image, showing nail wounds in hands, and feet, side wound, real blood, indications of a crown of thorns, a summation of death and resurrection, plus an image of what Jesus looked like would be outclassed by any of these others (which are very easily faked).’  I would also expect some mention of the double image as this is a distinguishing feature of the Turin Shroud.We have to wait until the fourteenth century for such a mention. As I have said before, I don’t accept a single reference that Ian Wilson has been able to provide as referring to the Turin Shroud, some of them obviously refer to other shrouds that were around and some refer to the Image of Edessa which is never described as a ‘shroud’. The same would go for the ‘;shrouds’ that I have found mentioned.Note the misleading comments of Dan Scavone who says that ‘sindon’ is the N.T. word for shroud. Well, it isn’t in any Greek lexicon or New Testament Greek dictionary that I know of. It refers to cloth ,especially fine linen, and that just describes the cloth Jesus was wrapped in.  It doesn’t become transformed into a general word for ‘shroud, any more than if Jesus’ body had been laid out on a table the word ‘table’ would become transformed into the word for ‘bier’.","date":"September 12, 2012 at 11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Thanks for yours Yannick. We both agree on the need to do a lot of rethinking in this area and to follow up many leads that have still not been explored. The adulation of Wilson has made people lazy!! So it is a debatable questions as to whether the images of the suffering Christ are a development from an earlier tenth century tradition or were a new departure, in the form they took , in the thirteenth century. I shall look forward to reading Professor Folda in detail on this- as always too expensive to buy my own copy so i shall have to track one down next time I am in the Cambridge UL!.Exploring relic collections on the ground is important because nowadays very few churches advertise what they have gathering dust in their sacristies. So I was delighted to find in the church of Catherine of Alexandria in Galatina , a finger of Catherine herself  and not any old finger but the one with the ring which the infant Christ placed on her finger himself  after he had appeared to her with His mother. It has been stolen from the body of St. Catherine in Sinai by a Norman noble who, as a good Catholic, believed that heretical Greek monks had no right to it!  There is scarcely a mention of it in the literature but there it still was, several hundred years later, in a room adjoining the church. That is why I prefer to do my own research on the ground.Alas, I have no plans to go to Halberstadt. My next tour is Istanbul/Constantinople itself but, of course, nothing of relevance left to explore so far as the Shroud is concerned. Then I take a tour of north-eastern italy and might just be able to look in on St Mark’s to see some of the icons they say were brought back from the Blachernae Chapel!Good researching – there is a long way to go but I think a lot of relevant material being covered by Profs. Klein, Dale and Folda. Both of us need to be on top of that if we want to take these debates further but alas I have too many other projects to continue contributing this blog.As a matter of principle I do not reply to Stephen Jones.

Can you clarify, please, which building ‘chapel you are referring to in  your post.The Blachernae was a district of Constantinople.The Church of the Blachernae was built on the site of a sacred spring by the empress Pulcheria in 451. She filled it with relics of the Virgin Mary and it contained the famous icon of the Virgin  Blachernitissa that was said to have saved the city in 626 when it was attacked by the Avars. It was,of course, a public place with expositions of the relics, often in processions in the courtyard. I have always assumed that it was here that Robert de Clari saw his shroud with an image although I know of no other reference to this shroud and no else seems to have seen one either. We simply do not know how far we should trust his account without any corroborating evidence to support it.It seems to have been looted in 1204 . I am awaiting  a copy of Thomas Bale’s article on the links between icons now in St. Mark’s Venice and the Church. The Church was burned down in 1434 and there is now a 1960s chapel on the site where the spring is still venerated.The Palace of Blachernae was used by the later Byzantine emperors. Parts of it still stand and there are excavations going on. i visited it last spring to see whether there was anything worth bringing my study group to see but it is boarded off and there is no public access at present.

Lord might well have been a(n) (most secret?) emblem of both the Byzantine emperor as representative of Christ and his power on Earth.’  (Emblem/symbol-well I suppose there is a distinction!)Well,if it is it is very secret! And what is the point of the secrecy when the divine aura has to be promulgated to the public as we know that it was from texts such as  De Cerimoniis . I think it would have been seen as blasphemous if the emperor had tried to link himself to the risen Lord. All the references suggest that the emperor was seen as a fully human representative of God on earth and clearly subordinate to him.The Image of Edessa was clearly of great importance to the emperors which is why it was kept so carefully and securely in the Pharos Chapel in its own case that only the emperor could open. I can see no evidence that it was the Shroud of Turin and a mass of evidence that it was never seen as a shroud -but this has been argued over ad infinitum and I am not going to reopen it. But there is no problem with the emperor having a special relationship with the Image as there were a number of relics that were of special importance and used as part of the public display of the emperor.(Again Klein is good on this-so I hope you bother to read him if you have not already.) Some go out on display, some appear in specific rituals ,e.g. the coronations (relics of Stephen), etc. The Robe of the Virgin was put on as a garment by the emperor Romanos when he went out to negotiate with  the Bulagrian ‘tsar’ Symeon in 924. Then there was the relic of the  True Cross that had an elaborate ritual in which it was processed around the city in July every year to ‘cleanse and and sanctify all places and houses of of the God-guarded and imperial city’ and then brought back to the throne room where it was placed on the imperial throne before being packed away again. So the emperors manipulated a number of different relics in different ways. Nowhere that I know of ( but there are many accounts involving relics so I, or Klein, may have missed something) is there anything that is clearly described as a ‘shroud’ being involved with imperial ritual.I am afraid I don’t go along with all this ‘secret’ stuff.

No problem here so long as they remain speculations but the overwhelming evidence is against your ‘might haves’ and we have to live with ‘best fits which are always provisional and can be changed as new documentary/archaeological evidence emerges. That’s my world and the world of most practising historians.I don’t believe that the Shroud of Turin and the Image of Edessa are the same. No Byzantine scholar has ever been able to find any evidence that they should be. I believe that the Image of Edessa was created ,like many other similar figures, most destroyed, of course, in the iconoclastic period, in the sixth century. Belting has the argument but ,of course, he is supported by others. This is why the attempts of Wilson and others to find a history between 30 and 550 fails so lamentably – and laughably-see my article on the Image of Edessa. There is no acceptable evidence yet found of any history ! No evidence that the Image of Edessa was ever  folded into four. A LEGEND  only says that the cloth was folded into four when it was without an image and BEFORE it was handed to Jesus. (Wilson gives the misleading  impression in his The Shroud ( 2010) that it was described as tetradiplon AFTER the image was on it and sadly all too many have been misled by this, even myself at one point ( I now know better!).)   No evidence that Jesus folded it BACK into four when Jesus passed it on. There are reasons why it MIGHT HAVE been folded before it was given to Jesus (see my article Tetradiplon Revisited). There are ways that it could have been folded into four  or the edges doubled up when it was stored so that the face could be kept in the centre in a smaller box but unless we have access to the Image of Edessa we would not know. There is not a single reference to tetradiplon of the Image after it had been wiped on Jesus’ face. The tetradiplon text, the Acts of Thaddeus, makes it quite clear that the burial cloths of Jesus, which are mentioned later in the Acts, are distinct from the cloth that was originallly tetradiplon. So here, although this is purely a legendary account, there is no support in it, in fact the opposite, for the Image of Edessa and the Shroud of Turin being the same. But one can go on saying this forever without convincing those who wish to believe otherwise! Please note: I am saying  ‘There is no evidence’. We can only work when there is evidence.Of course  the emperor was the representative of God/ Jesus on earth, but the distinction between human and divine was made very clearly in the texts (otherwise you would never be able to depose an emperor).  You seem to have misquoted me.What I said: ‘All the references suggest that the emperor was seen as a fully human representative [sic] of God on earth and clearly subordinate to him.’What you seem to think I said: ‘Secondly, you can ‘think’ Byzantine emperors were not seen as REPRESENTATIVE OF CHRIST. ‘Methinks’ NOT A FEW Byzantine scholars will TOTALLY disagree with you. The imperial throne was ALWAYS placed BENEATH Christ ‘empty throne’ (THUS there was nothing blaphemous at all about it)’As Christ was a consubstantial part of the Godhead, the emperor was clearly a representative of God/Christ /the Holy Spirit. I assumed that everyone would know this but perhaps I was wrong. I said nothing about  the emperor not being a representative of Christ!! The blasphemy would come if he crossed the boundaries and aligned himself with the divine Christ. I am not sure what you mean by the emperor’s empty throne being placed benath Christ’s empty throne. The evidence we have of the Chrysotrklinos ( the octagonal audience hall of the Palace) is that the empty imperial throne ( occupied ,of course by the emperor on special feasts and ceremonies) was under an image of Christ  believed to be a mosaic. (See J.M. Featherstone,’ De Ceremoniis and the Great Palace’, in P. Stephenson (ed.) ,The Byzantine World, Routledge, 2010, pp. 165-6.)I still don’t understand the context (s) in which you use the word ‘secret’. The danger is that if there is no evidence for something one says this is because it is ‘secret’. This way pseudohistory lies – not always, of course, but in the vast majority of cases I know of. (Particularly bad among the pseudohistorians of ancient Egypt!). Ian Wilson’s ‘secret history’ of the Shroud of Turin under the Knights Templar is an especially laughable case- I really could not believe his text on this. (Paraphrase: We don’t know what happened to the Shroud. Therefore we must look for people who kept secrets. The Knights Templar had lots of secret rituals.  Therefore it is likely the Shroud went to the Knights Templar and that is why we have no evidence of its existence.’ This is a classic of the genre!)

I doubt whether a single person reading this blog is able to enter into it. Good luck to you but you cannot expect people to answer questions from a perspective that is solely your own.I have been asking the simple questions such as ‘ What do you mean when you talk of the private Blachernae Chapel of the emperors? Do you mean a chapel within the Blachernae Palace or do you mean the Church of the Virgin Mary in the Blachernae district? I have no doubt that the emperors visited the Church of the Virgin Mary just as they did Hagia Sophia on certain feast days but I have never seen the Church referred to as their ‘private chapel’. In addition, I am not sure what the point you are trying to make is by referring to the ‘private chapel’. How does that add to the story? Relic processions are well documented in the list of ceremonies of the emperors  and in other accounts. These were public displays and different relics appeared on different occasions. The problem we have with de Clari’s account is that despite quite a number of records about the icons/relics of the Church of the Blachernae no one other de Clari ever mentions a shroud. It certainly was not one of the important relics of the city or we would have known of it. As de Clari himself says, nothing more is known of it after the sack. It does not figure in any of the surviving lists of looted relics that Crusaders drew up. De Clari may have been mistaken as to what he saw in the gloom of the church, it may have been destroyed during the looting of the city. Without any documentary evidence to corroborate his account, the question must simply be left open as to whether it ever existed or, if it did, whether it survived the sack of the city. The Church of the Blachernae was after all one of the most vulnerable parts of the city and when one reads ( in Nikoletes Choniatas’ account)  that even the altar of Hagia Sophia was ripped apart by the crusaders ( with marble from Hagia Sophia reappearing in St. Marks!) one must wonder what elsewas lost.I am sorry, Max, to be so mundane.

For instance, not a single member of the original STURP team had so far as I am aware, and I am happy to be corrected, any expertise in ancient textiles. No preliminary examination of the physical condition of the  Shroud was made in 1978 before a programme of analysis was developed by the external STURP group. ( I blame those who let them in -suppose I wrote to the Director of the Louvre saying that I was a physicist with no knowledge of fifteenth century painting but I wanted access to the Mona Lisa and to be allowed to take samples off the surface- it would be the job of the Director  to tell me to get lost!) The STURP team just arrived and got to down to work under immense time  pressure to get their samples. Whoever heard of a proper programme of analysis working under such conditions! And the STURP team then separated and isolated  the samples from which a lot of the later work was done and we all know what happened when STURP made decisions about who should have them.Of course, some experts have worked on the Shroud and have done useful work. Mechtild Flury- Lemberg , for instance, whom you cite, rubbished Ray Rogers on reweaving so this was progress, even if her work is not acknowledged by the Ray Rogers fans. My real point is that with every year that passes we develop new techniques of analysis and if these were applied to the Shroud in proper conditions by experts we are likely to solve the mystery of how the image of the Shroud was made. I am not saying that we will but there has been such progress in all these fields ,even since Flury- Lemberg was working ten years ago, that we can have some confidence that the mystery will be solved along with a more precise dating (as this field also is rapidly developing).So over to the Vatican!","date":"September 16, 2012 at 4:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am sure that all this has been said before. Robert de Clari was from Picardy , a ‘poor knight’ as he describes himself, and he brought back relics he had taken from the Palace at Constantinople which he gave to the monastery at Corbie in his native Picardy in two batches , 1206 and 1213. Michael Angold in his The Fourth Crusade ( p 13) suggests that de Clari’s account was written to justify his taking of the relics he gave to the monastery and that the account was lodged there. There is only one manuscript version of it that dates from a hundred years later, c, 1300. As Angold suggests there is no evidence that it was ever circulated very widely as it was never written for a wider audience. As has been widely suggested, the reference to the burial shroud in the Blachernae Chapel was only a marginal comment. We have absolutely no other mention of this relic and this suggests that it did not have a big following. It could not be the Mandylion or the OTHER set of burial cloths mentioned in the Pharos Chapel as these would not have been moved to an alternative shrine without a great deal of publicity ( These moves simply did not happen unless the relic was looted as did happen in some cases, e.g. the bones of St. Benedict from Monte Cassino -if you had a relic you hung on to it!) de Clari would presumably have known that at this date the burial shroud on show at Cadouin was the one which was packing in the pilgrims and making the abbey there very wealthy. We now know that it is a fake, made in one of the caliph’s workshops, but it was brought back after the First Crusade directly from Jerusalem and  obviously relics of the Passion that it was claimed were found in Jerusalem had a special cachet, as they had done ever since Helena had found ‘the True Cross’ there in the 320s and Arculf had seen both the burial shroud and the sudarium still there in the late seventh century. Wilson is clearly embarrassed by Arculf’s account but he repeats it omitting the reference to the shroud that Arculf saw in the tomb and arguing that the separate  sudarium was actually the  Turin Shroud that had been temporarily removed to Jerusalem because of an earthquake in Edessa. The fact that the Jerusalem sudarium was described as only eight feet long  and that it floated above a fire that was set alight to see if it was authentic ( it was!) is explained by Wilson as that it was the Turin Shroud but this time folded into two. Well, you have to give him full marks for imagination. In his determination to show that this sudarium was the Turin Shroud Wilson also omits the part of the account which says that it had been in Jerusalem all along but hidden by a Jew after it had been stolen from the tomb.","date":"September 10, 2012 at 4:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Carlos. It think it is standard practice to examine a textile such as the Shroud in detail before any work is done on it, just as the Mona Lisa would be examined very carefully before any conservation work was done on it. The older the textile is the more this preliminary analysis is needed because we are dealing with very rare survivals of any cloth (outside Egypt) from before AD 1000 This is to make sure that when you actually touch the fabric you know exactly what harm you are likely to cause. It is also important to have time when in fact 1978 was an enormous rush. There does not seem to any proper scientific procedure for dealing with the samples removed from the Shroud in 1978. Was Walter MacCrone qualified or not qualified to analyse them? If he was not why was he given the job and by whom? How could Ray Rogers be sure of the provenance of his threads in 2003 and how does he know that they were not contaminated between 1988 and 2003? This was not a proper scientific way of going about researching the Shroud. No one was in overall control much of the wrangling would have been avoided if there had been a single TEXTILE  laboratory in charge of the whole process which worked on the samples in-house.The Shroud has to be examined as a whole in laboratory conditions. We are 35 years on from the STURP investigation, 25 years on from the radio-carbon dating. In all the fields associated with the Shroud there have been enormous scientific advances and most ( stress ‘most’ ) of the inconclusive debates I see here still seem to depend on old samples or by people who have never examined the Shroud as a whole. Even if we have to wait another ten years for scientific analysis of the cloth to advance even further, I still think the mystery will eventually be solved. Until then, perhaps an open mind??There are still problems to sort out. Are we sure that the blood on the Shroud and the Sudarium of Oviedo is AB? If so, most blood experts, so far as I can discover but this is not my field, believe that we have virtually no examples of AB before 900 and it really only becomes common with the mingling of Caucasian and Mongoloid groups after AD 1000.","date":"September 16, 2012 at 10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Carlos.

Research undertaken in Hungary, from a necropolis dating from the IVth and VIIth century to this date, did not placed any individuals belonging to the AB blood group.’Other sources suggest that the mixing of bloods took place when the Hungarians occupied the Carpathian Basin c. AD 900 and that is why you have no record of any evidence of AB blood groups before 900. (Mongoloids (B) also mixed with Indian and far eastern populations (As) which is why you have AB groupings there.)The genetic mutation would have occurred in very few people at first and would only have spread as interaction increased which is why I have read other accounts that we should look at 1000-1100 for the appearance of a larger proportion of the AB blood type in Europe.I have no expertise in this field  and I am open to any evidence that AB blood groups existed before 900. I have simply never seen any evidence that they did so I shall stick with the AD 900 date until I am informed otherwise!","date":"September 16, 2012 at 2:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"The same country , the US, can get a craft to Pluto and also be the home of a mass of creationists.In the Middle  Ages they could build a Gothic cathedral and still turn up to Orleans to be given a cup of wine left over from the marriage feast of Cana.","date":"July 15, 2015 at 3:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/15/swipe-of-the-day/","cat":"art","title":"Swipe of the Day"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S.

So if the short left leg is important and we see it also first in Rome c.750, I think I am building up a credible thesis that the Shroud came into the west quite early on. I still think that likelihood of the Shroud being authentic is small but here at least is a thesis that does not contradict its authenticity.It’s a long haul weaning people off Wilson’s hypothesis but I think it is important to stress that there are alternative and more plausible ways of showing how the Shroud if it were authentic could have ended up in Lirey. I think it is a pity that there are so many people with a genuine commitment to the authenticity of the Shroud who  are not prepared to do any further research on it or, after all these years, spot the serious inadequacies of the Wilson thesis. I still have no idea what he means by ‘double in four’ when he shows a cloth doubled into eight, but he was using this meaningless phrase as early as 1974 and he is still using it.

Perhaps Stephen Jones can explain what he thinks I know but don’t know.

The prefix ‘tetra’ on the other hand, is very common – at least 150 examples in a standard Greek dictionary such as Liddel and Scott. We can see that the most likely meaning when compared to other examples of the use of ‘tetra’ is four doublings but it could possibly mean doubled so as to make four (not eight) sections.If Stephen can start by taking us through his doublings one by one, then that would be a start.","date":"February 6, 2014 at 12:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/06/touching-on-the-byzantine-legend-that-jesus-had-a-shorter-leg-and-therefore-was-lame/","cat":"art","title":"Touching on the Byzantine legend that Jesus had a shorter leg and therefore was lame"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘folded eight times in the form of the Mandylion portrait’.This certainly needs clarification. Does he mean eight fold?- in other words the THREE double foldings that are need to achieve eight sections as Wilson illustrates them but without any explanation from Wilson as to how tetradiplon can mean three rather than four doublings? We really do need to clear up the confusing picture Wilson leaves on this, As is well known I think ‘tetradiplon ‘ used only of the cloth BEFORE it was unfolded in front of Jesus has a completely different significance ( it ties in with the tetradiplon folding used in ceremonies such as the Panathenaia festival and is this a means of giving the cloth Jesus used status before he used it) . Again Wilson is confusing in suggesting that  the cloth was folded ‘tetradiplon’ AFTER it had the face of Christ on it .I have no particular background on the slanted crucifixion foot piece. It will mean working through Schiller’s massive book on Christian iconography to see if it is standard iconography. A quick look- the earliest I see in Schiller is a ROMAN example, a wall painting  that is dated to 750 that does have a shorter left leg (illus 328). The famous Byzantine example from Mount Sinai of roughly the same date shows equal lengths of legs and a level board. All the Byzantine ones Schiller illustrates have a stable board so that seems to be the norm in the east but I am not an expert on this.Incidentally, if this is relevant  and the Rome crucifixion depiction IS taken from the Shroud this would add to the possibility that the Shroud might have come to the west early. After all the Roman crucifixion scene is roughly the same date that  the relic collection with relics from the Lord’s Tomb arrived in northern France!

If Wilson makes this case he needs a Byzantine scholar to back him. Until then I shall continue to argue that, so far as I am concerned , he is highly misleading.The lines are still open for anyone who can provide support for Wilson.We know that in the Greek world the most prestigious cloth of all, the cloth that was taken up to the Acropolis in the Panathenaic festival that was attended by Greeks from all over and went on until the fourth century AD was folded double four times. If you are in the British Museum you can go and see it on the sculptures and it is so beautifully sculpted that one can count the double folds, four of them. My guess, and it is only a guess, is that this form of folding linked to this prestigious festival meant that a tetradiplon cloth had a special significance and this is why the Acts of Thaddeus say that the cloth as PRESENTED to Jesus (but contra to what Wilson suggests was never said to have been refolded as such, any more than the Panathenaic cloth would have been refolded after it had fulfilled its ritual function) as tetradiplon. It is a much more likely explanation than anything Wilson can offer. ‘Anonymous’ has, of course, made the other point that Wilson conceals from us , that there is a totally separate mention of Christ’s burial cloths in the very same text so whoever wrote the Acts knew that there was the Image of Edessa and the burial cloth as separate items.Of course, nothing in this says anything either way about the authenticity of the Shroud as we have it today so that is not the issue there. I stick to my thesis that ,IF the Shroud were authentic, the most likely route to Lirey would have been with the relics known to have come direct to northern France, including some from the ‘Lord’s Tomb’, in the second half of first millennium.","date":"February 8, 2014 at 4:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/06/touching-on-the-byzantine-legend-that-jesus-had-a-shorter-leg-and-therefore-was-lame/","cat":"art","title":"Touching on the Byzantine legend that Jesus had a shorter leg and therefore was lame"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Does Max realise that by posting lots of small and sometime incomprehensible postings , he clogs up the comments list above, so that no one knows what else has been posted under other headings.

We know beyond any doubt from medieval manuals and the few surviving medieval,painted linens that painting  took place only on the outer surface of a cloth sealed with gesso. We also know that with folding and unfolding the pigments could disintegrate.  A place called Barley Hall has apparently done some experiments with this but they never replied to my e-mail.The question then becomes: ‘if the pigments have been in place for five hundred years and then disintegrate what is left underneath?, Presumably the cloth has been affected depending on the density of the pigments  so that one is left with shadowy images that will vary in consistency with the density and perhaps types of pigment of the original paint. My suspicion is that they will vary so light painted areas will appear darker and heavily painted areas lighter so,perhaps,providing us with the apparent negatives. But in addition to this we have the artist creating a mirror image.So now one needs to find a textile expert who may know of similar examples. The best case of the pigments disintegrating that I know of is the Zittau Veil- the pigments came off when steamed- but I don’t know whether the remaining shadows where the pigments were are negatives or not.This is a plausible hypothesis and so needs to be tested out, just as the Oxford lab tested out John Jackson’ s hypothesis about carbon monoxide affecting the radiocarbon date and finding that it did not.So to go back to the original questions: my hypothesis is that the artist WAS trying to create a mirror image but that the apparent negative image is what is left when the pigments came off after five hundred years of covering the weaver: so nothing to do with the artist himself.","date":"February 22, 2015 at 3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/very-disturbing/","cat":"art","title":"Very Disturbing"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"The original painting, in my view, has all-over scourge marks because these were an iconographic innovation of the fourteenth century noted by Professor James Marrow of Princeton University ( though not with reference to the Shroud but to other examples – he notes that they were inspired by Isaiah 1:6) .Originally there was no loin cloth as can be seen from the Lirey Pilgrim Badge, the Lier copy and the illustration of the Shroud in the 1559 prayer book of Marguerite de Valois now in the Royal library of Turin.

Some may have been just the sudarium and some may just have had bloodstains. There clearly was not a standard Quem Queritis image. The Mozarabic rites that go back to the seventh century in Spain talk of Peter and John going to the tomb and seeing ‘the recent imprints of the dead and risen man on the linens’ .Yes, these were intended to be imprints – everyone would have known that a body with sweat and blood on it laid on a cloth would leave some sort of imprint, if only bloodstains, and it would be a negative of the body itself and the artist depicting it might well have decided not to use as many colours as the top class artists of the day ( judging from the few top-class painted linens that have survived). After all everyone seeing the cloth would have known that it was not the real thing but a symbolic representation- ‘our’ parish or monastery shroud brought out once a year at Easter .( ‘Representation’ is the word often used of the Shroud  image although there is a linguistic barrier here).However, as this was a revered cloth, carried in procession, laid on the altar, etc , it would have achieved some form of spiritual significance and have been treated with reverence, probably locked up between Easters. In some cases miracles would have been reported  and then the cloth would have been given even more status and one might even get a pope allowing pilgrims an indulgence. ( As is the case in similar objects- we have a  banner made in 1464 in Perugia, carried in penitents’ processions  that became associated with the cessation of plague and so, like the Shroud, got an indulgence even though everyone knew it was recently made.) This is the way these things tended to work even if we don’t know exactly what gave the Shroud sufficient status to earn that indulgence.There is lots of material on how particular objects were transformed into apparently genuine relics although nothing survives of this for the Shroud except the prominence, I think, of Jeanne de Vergy in the  attempt. My favourite is the opportune discovery of the body of Mary Magdalene at St. Maximin in Provence  in 1279 when there was already a Mary Magdalene body at Vezelay. Here Charles of Salerno won out by saying he had a vision of where to dig and the body would be recognised by the amphora of Christ’s blood that Mary had gathered at the cross and a green shoot growing from her tongue. And this indeed was what was dug up.  The poor monks of Vezelay had nothing to challenge this and their shrine soon lost out to St.Maximin where pilgrims still come to this day.","date":"January 21, 2015 at 12:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Thomas, as you know I rely heavily on the depictions and descriptions of the Shroud that put together give a very strong case for the more prominent nature of the images as they were originally. It is surely wrong to neglect these particularly when observers note the Crown of Thorns  in place and one can also see it in numerous  depictions.Let us take one small point. If you look at the Lier copy and  every depiction of the Shroud in the seventeenth century that I know of then you can see that the hair on the dorsal image reaches around the back of Christ’s head. Yet you cannot see that today and Ian Wilson always shows a pony tail.  So this is convincing evidence that the Shroud image today is not as it once was. ( the pint is made by comparing the way the hair is shown to confirm that different artists were seeing the same thing.)In this it would be typical of almost every ancient artefact we know unless it has been kept in very specialconditions or made of something more solid than linen and pigments. So it makes sense to take as the secondary aim of all Shroud research – what did the Shroud look like when it was ORIGINALLY made. This is the focus of my own research.The primary aim is,of course, to establish what kind of loom the Shroud was woven on as the weave comes before the images and if you can date the weave then you have a basis to work from for the creation of the images. I have not yet found a weaver specialising in ancient textiles who thinks it is anything other than a typical weave of a medieval treadle loom so it is over to the authenticists to challenge this. It is the width, a standard medieval treadle loom width, and the length that gives it away.I have no problems with Hugh, in his recent editorial, and in the review of my article ,in saying my article is not definitive. We do need a database of all the copies and the depictions of the Shroud before we can fulfil the second aim of defining what the Shroud once looked like. This seems so basic!I have searched high and low for other liturgies that involve the display of a painted linen cloth with images of the buried Christ on it. The Quem Queritis ceremony certainly did but there may be others.And everyone ducks the sudden appearance in the fourteenth century of the all over flagellation marks that are seen in sculpture and painting. I have provided, courtesy of Professor Marrow, an explanation of this based on scriptural inspirations. You need to provide evidence that ancient scourging did in fact cover the whole body front and back.To take up a point Hugh (?) made in his review of my article, once the pigments started to flake off or disintegrate ( as they do appear to be in the 1868 exposition when the Shroud had to be shown in a frame for the first time,) then they would gradually all come off- perhaps in one of the thirty year storage periods of the nineteenth century. Normally the linen would then be thrown away but the Savoys could hardly throw away the Shroud. And I suppose they could hardly repaint it although we do know that some painted linens were touched up when they began to fade.So, as I said in an earlier posting, we are at the stage of research on the Shroud, with many false avenues taken so far, that the Egyptian pyramids were in the 1880s. The first task is to assemble the evidence of the Shroud in the past in a way that is open to scholars to examine and compare.","date":"January 21, 2015 at 4:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.s.

If you can’t get hold of the catalogue of the Savoy collection, it is the fullest panorama of the evidence we need to discuss the issue and second hand copies are available on Abebooks. The great architect of eighteenth century Turin, Filippo Juvarra,contributed an engraving of the ostension of 1737 ( now in the Royal Library in Turin). It is on page 257 of Beldon Scott.The crowd is massed in good order in the Piazza Castello ( they had tightened up the procedure since the chaos shown in Tempesta’s engraving of 1613)  and I suspect that it is the architectural setting that most interested Juvarra- there is a wonderful Barogue viewing pavilion- but he presents the whole facade of the platforms. So the Shroud is at quite a distance but you can still see the images on it. Would Juvarra, and so many other artists, really have shown the images if they could not be seen and why would the Savoys arrange this ordered viewing by an enormous audience if hardly any of them would have been able to see the images. It does not make sense to me.Of course, Juvarra’s is only one of many depictions showing the images more clearly than they are now and with features that have not vanished with time. As I always say to anyone who asks me how to recreate the images on the Shroud today: ‘Have you got five hundred years to spare?’  It needs time and constant handling/ exposure to the elements to create faded images on cloth or to allow the pigments to disintegrate leaving only shadows where the paint once was.","date":"January 24, 2015 at 3:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am sure that I shall have to reconsider some parts of my argument when we have specialist input that we have not yet had.However, I shall stick to two central points:1) We are still at the beginning of serious Shroud research in many areas as so much previous research has been badly focussed and so many areas have still not had specialist academic input.2) The Shroud now is not as it once was and we should be focussing on discovering how it looked originally.

We are exceptionally lucky in having a very rich collection of representations of the Shroud as it once was. Some of these, invariably by unnamed artists, are copies on textiles which may or may not have faded with time. Some are on lead, the Liery Pilgrim Badge. Some are engravings,some etchings, some lithographs. Some are competent, some are amateur. Some show some features such as a Crown of Thorns, others, if only a minority,do not. Virtually all them how the hair on the back of the head as falling down across the whole nape of the neck, something that can no longer be seen today.In some cases we know that the artit or engraver was exceptionally competent. Antonio Tempesta, for instance, was famous for his engraving of Rome of 1593  which can be accessed through the Metropolitan Museum, New Yrok, website. So famous was he that the Savoys asked him to Turin and he produced a composite view of the exposition ( it is composite in that it includes the Shroud coming in its carriage to the site where it was displayed as well as the display itself .) it is hard to imagine that in this one instance he was faking what he saw.I have consistently argued that this enormously rich resource for the study of tHe Shroud needs to be assembled on one database so that it is accessible to anyone, specialist in art history or not, to study.  It is quite extraordinary that it has been completely neglected. There will be features once on the Shroud that can be seen on both copies on textiles and engravings but if we persist in putting copies against engravings we will get nowhere.

It is the same method I used in my book on the Horses of St,Marks. Yes, we can learn a lot from looking at them today but we must take them back to their original context and condition if we are to understand their origins. In fact, I am only following the normal approach to ancient objects. I am not sure why Shroud researchers start the other way round in believing that what exists today is somehow more meaningful than what existed centuries before. Perhaps it is because none of them have ever systematically studied any other ancient object.I am glad we, or at least Hugh and I, can argue from Beldon Scott. Figure 163 shows the same ostension as the Bolckmann does but from close up while his is from a great distance- It is difficult to argue,contra Beldon Scott, that the image on the Shroud is not there when it is very much there in detail in Boglietto’s etching of 1683 which is a good example as it clearly shows the Crown of Thorns, the long hair on the neck and the thumbs in a similar way to other depictions. Not all depictions are detailed enough to show the now vanished thumbs but so far as I can see most show them pointing out at an identical angle suggesting that is how they once were on the Shroud. Why would Bolckmann be the only person to show a depiction lacking the images (and it is not clear that they are not there) when everyone else seems to have reproduced them? Were all the other artists conned over a period starting from the very distinct images of the Lirey Pilgrim Badge onwards despite the change of owners.  Whether etchings, engravings or lithographs, whether 1578, 1683 or 1842 they all show strong images. It is only in the ostension of 1868 (B.S. p.296)  where we clearly see a deterioration in one image  and the artist Perrin had no problem in showing part of the front image as faint and the rest similar to early depictions. So why did all the others have this problem and what would be the source of the Crown of Thorns and long hair in the back if they were not there? 1868  was also the first ostension where the Shroud had to be placed within a frame – a sign that they knew that it was deteriorating.Beldon Scott is good on how the influence of the French court  ( Louis XIV) made the ostensions very much more ordered than they had been in the chaotic days of Tempesta.","date":"January 24, 2015 at 12:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"}],"blood":[{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I loved the Hebrew letters blog.

It didn’t come across clearly what his position was but I replied to it, alongside a fascinating character called Trini who has it in for me. I wonder why. There are two books still to be written on the Shroud. One is to suggest that it may have originated in the East, even as early as the seventh-eighth centuries, drawing on Byzantine iconography, possibly coming into Europe with the Crusaders, in the same way that many  other relics are known to have come. I suspect others have researched this but there is a mass of documentation to explore. The cloth may originally have been woven in Arab workshops even, as the Veil of St.Anne ,the mother of he Virgin at Apt in the Vauclose is known to have been ( the Arabic lettering is still on it and it was four years old rather than  1100 as it needed to be when it was brought back).The second is to explore the fiascos surrounding ‘scientific’ research. If you trawl the websites it is amazing how many bits and pieces of the Shroud are flying around.How did Raymond Rogers get material for his 2005 paper? He is good enough to tell us himself in his ‘peer-reviewed’ paper.‘On 12 December 2003, I received samples of both warp and weft threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella had taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. Gonella reported that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.’Now this is fifteen years  after the radio-carbon 14 sample was taken and Gonella was present but apparently not authorised to take any sample himself, but clearly he was able to do so, or at least provide what Rogers assumed was original material. Then sadly Rogers died and attempts were made to get hold of his material by another STURP member.‘When I first received the materials from the Rogers family, I noticed that one important sample was missing, Raes #1, the apparent end-to-end spliced thread that Rogers had identified. More than a year passed before I received the contents of Ray’s computer and it was only then that I discovered that Ray had given the sample to several of his LANL colleagues for scientific analysis just two weeks before he died. Fortunately, Ray had included their names, so I immediately contacted Bob Villarreal at the lab, introduced myself and asked him about the missing sample, which of course he still had in his possession. At that point (and much relieved that I had found the sample), I asked him if he would be willing to continue the work he had begun several years earlier with Ray. He enthusiastically agreed and over the past year I made some additional samples available to him and his team. This paper presents the results of their analyses of those samples.’Then in an interesting interview online Shroud researcher Joseph Marino tells us that he has an actual relic from the Shroud, although he was disappointed to find that it was only from the backing cloth.Who is charge of distribution of fragments of the Shroud? It seems that you have to sign up as pro-Shroud before you are allowed to have any. How does anyone keep a check on what is where and whether it is being contaminated or not?  I assume that most of these come either  from the Raes sample- but how has that got into the public domain so that Rogers got hold of some?- or the 32 pieces of sellotape  taken in the frenzied five day examination of the Shroud in 1978 in a hall where fragments of pigment were apparently floating down from the ceiling frescos. The 32 pieces of  sellotape was then passed on to one Walter Mccrone and we all know how that ended.

So they would have failed his peer review abysmally.I have never found any of my forensic contacts who have seen blood this red, in one case from thirty years of experience.You need to firm up your evidence that  you can get old blood this red. Perhaps English blood is different!But best of all get a 2015 laboratory to do the tests again and then we would have a definitive answer. I am doing my own independent work on the Shroud and can only go on what I am told by independent experts. If I ever publish again( and I am happy for the moment with the responses I have had to the History Today article) then I can set out the expert opinions I have received on the blood.","date":"November 3, 2015 at 2:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/30/bob-rucker-a-burst-of-radiation-did-three-things/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Bob Rucker:  A Burst of Radiation Did Three Things"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Thomas. You are right. In the gospel of John, the only one to mention the side wound, it does not say which side it was on. By the sixth century, the Rabbella Gospels, the convention had grown up of placing it on the right side. The artists of the ceremonial cloths were recreating the marks of the body as transferred onto the linen and so they placed it on the left. We have another example on the Besancon Shroud and there were doubtless many more now lost.There needs to be a lot more research on the Spanish evidence as the Mozarbic rites talk of early cloths with double images- the key evidence we need to pin down precursors of the Shroud images. It is all too easy to assume that these are copies of the Shroud but the originals  may have been in Spain and the Turin Shroud an offshoot. with virtually every painted cloth lost, we may never know but it is worth following up.If Professor Michelle Brown is right the illustrations in the Holkham Bible (London, 1330)  were used as a template for artists and these show Christ naked on the cross and with wounds on his head very similar to those on the Man of the Shroud- even down to the same kind of squiggle. I am not saying that the Holkham Bible was the template for the Shroud but that this iconography, and even more so the all over front and back scourge marks was typical of the early fourteenth century. It is just some of the subsidiary evidence that fits with the original production of the Shroud as a painted linen. If you have Beldon Scott, and it amazes me that people who claim to be Shroud researchers don~’t have it at their fingertips, you will see the lithograph of 1868 that show the images partially disintegraqted.","date":"November 3, 2015 at 4:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/30/bob-rucker-a-burst-of-radiation-did-three-things/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Bob Rucker:  A Burst of Radiation Did Three Things"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Bob.

However we have other linens with images on them and so the Shroud is not unique in that respect. One of the best examples of images on a linen cloth similar to those on the Shroud is the Zittern veil In Saxony where the pigments of an originally painted surface were steamed off by looters in WWII  leaving discoloured linen behind.You are assuming that the images  on the Shroud were caused by a body but the so- called blood evidence has never been replicated and is disputed by experts on the grounds that it is too red for dried blood. It could, of course, have been added in the medieval period when cults involving the blood of Christ became very lucrative so even if new tests do show human blood this does not mean that it is first century.

Have you read the fascinating paper on Palestine textiles  by the organic materials specialist from the Bari Conference – one of the nine they published? It seems to have been overlooked here and even includes a reference to a much later example of the Flury-Lemberg stitch.Christians did not give spiritual power to and collect relics before the fourth century, there were hundreds of thousands of medieval relics so a relic first recorded in the medieval period is more likely to be of that period. It only needs one expert associated with linen conservation to give specialist support to the idea that this is a linen discoloured by having had gesso and paint on it for several centuries before these disintegrated. Then we would have a solid working hypothesis. I am working on it but would prefer to publish in a recognised specialist textile journal with a specialist co-writer to give me wider credibility.Meanwhile the balance of probability is overwhelmingly against the survival of such a large cloth over two thousand years unless it had been in a tomb in Egypt. If it had been first century, we would have had some excited textile specialists crawling over a unique three-in-one herringbone weave , not otherwise known until third century silk damasks, of this size.

The Shroud is exceptionally well documented and there are many early depictions of it by a variety of engravers, painters, etc. We can assemble a database of all these for specialists to pore over at their leisure.With work on painted linens continuing apace, there is also a lot to be done on bringing together all the new research and examples to see how they might illuminate features of the Shroud.

Yannick has shown in detail on this site why his thesis does not hold up in historical terms and I endorse Yannick’s findings. The real tragedy is that Wilson has diverted attention away from other leads. Did you know, for instance, that we have important early medieval relic collections at Sens, 90 kilometres from Lirey, and Chelles, 185 kilometres from Lirey. 31 relics of the collection that remain at Sens and whose dates of arrival are dated to between AD 600 and 1000 are tagged as coming from the Holy Land. Three of the eighth century relics still in the collection are said to be from the ‘Lord’s Tomb’ in Jerusalem. Chelles has five relics whose arrival is dated between 700 and 800 that are tagged as coming from the Holy Land including ‘a stone from Calvary’.  These are detailed in Michael McCormick\\s study ‘The Origins of the European Economy’, Cambridge UP 2001. McCormick was trying to find evidence of trade between Europe and the Holy Land and he realised that relics provided relevant material. However, Shroud researchers should be following up these leads. They may lead nowhere but they certainly cannot be ruled out if one is trying to find out the possible routes an early relic might have reached northern France.Then what about the sudarium and shroud reported to have been taken by the prince -bishop of Halberstadt, Conrad of Krosigk, from Constantinople in 1204? Instead of going on about the Knights Templar when he has absolutely no evidence that they ever had the Shroud, why did Wilson not follow up this lead- and why has no one else (so far as I know)?  It is documented in Michael Angold’s The Fourth Crusade.  Was it the one from the Blachernae Church?I, and Yannick, and perhaps others ,cannot possibly understand why anyone supports Wilson when his history is so inadequate and there are so many potentially more fruitful lines of research that have been ignored.","date":"August 24, 2013 at 1:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Fine.

Turn to page 28 where at the bottom of the page is a picture that Wilson has given a caption to as follows:‘How the theoretical body was laid in the Shroud. Reconstruction after a painting by the seventeenth-century artist G.B. della Rovere’.Note that the painting itself is not illustrated but if you bring it up on a search engine you will find that Wilson has reproduced something completely different.Della Rovere showed the elbows of Christ bent and the right hand over the left. Wilson shows the arms straight and the left hand over the right!Della Rovers shows the legs straight down on the ground, Wilson has them bent upwards. This means that the soles of Wilson’s feet are almost full on the ground while Della Rovere’s are at a higher angle.Della Rover, following the conventions of the day, has put on a loin cloth. Wilson leaves it off.Now Wilson could simply have said that he was putting a theoretical reconstruction of the burial but it was HIS choice to say that it was ‘after della Rovere’ when it is most certainly isn’t.Can any of Wilson’s fans explain why?I can only say that for myself I never accept anything that Wilson says without checking further.

None of us can read everything and I for one have stopped reading Colin completely as he is always changing his mind. I am sure he will tell us when he has finally found the end of the rainbow.I had come across Drusik in Rogers and Schwalbe’s  paper on the Shroud and was interested in him because he suggested that the calcium carbonate may have been on the top of the linen and influenced the discolouration that we now have on the Shroud. This fits with other evidence that this was originally a sealed and painted cloth and, unlike anyone on the STURP team, Drusik may actually have known something about painted linens and what one can expect to find when, as happened eventually in most cases, the painted/ gessoed surface disintegrated.I am still waiting for the scientific evidence that dates the Shroud to before 1000 AD. It seems to be assumed that there is some but it is never properly set out. I would be more interested in Fanti’s dating if his three methods had come to the same result . The fact that the three dates were so disparate suggests that he has not found a reliable dating method- also there is the problem with his samples and his averaging methods seems a bizarre way of dealing with three widely differing dates, only one of which at most, may be accurate.Again Rogers’ guess at an earlier date based on vanillin,etc., is  not supported by any replicable method of dating.

Bodies of the local population before 900 have been analysed for their blood grouping and so far no evidence of AB has been found. This is not conclusive but we need to do better than one  sample from 1977- why has it never been replicated?- why is it not quoted in later studies of genetic material from Israel?

Until I have been, I am entitled to put the AB blood typing of the Shroud alongside the other evidence that it was made, by means as yet unknown, in the medieval period. I am ready to change my opinion if countervailing evidence is provided and if I am convinced I stand to make a lot of money from rewriting my book on medieval relics with an authentic example of a relic purporting to come from the first century. After all all these relics, from the Cross , nails, Crown of Thorns, burial shroud , bones of the apostles, the Virgin Mary’s slippers and girdles,  actually existed at one point- the question is whether any of them have survived. As any archaeologist working in this area (regional and with this kind of artefact) will tell you, it is unlikely especially as the evidence from early Christianity shows that, as with most Protestant communities today, the preservation of relics was not considered important.As that great Church Father, Basil of Caesarea, complained when relic collecting BEGAN in the fourth century: ‘As the sun does not need the lamplight, so also the church of the congregation can do without the remains of the martyrs. It is sufficient to venerate the name of Christ, for the Church is his bride, redeemed by his blood’. The Protestant reformers agreed which is why they destroyed relics without compunction and that included those such as the bones of Thomas Becket that we know were genuine- it simply did not matter to them because they, like the early Christians, did not see relics as relevant to the way they worshipped God.So my request remains open for examples of AB blood groups before 900 and I shall go on asking my history of medicine contacts who will not necessarily even know why I am asking them.

An accidental drifting in of the fibres during spinning (?the apparent splice) or weaving seems many times more likely than a deliberate placing of them among linen,new or otherwise, for no apparent reason.

The other was that linen threads and cotton THREADs ( not fibres!) were often woven alternatively in cloths known as fustians.Raes who was an expert on this made the same point.First we need  evidence of a woven part of the Shroud with cotton THREADS in it . Then if that evidence is found we need an explanation of why the threads were woven into the Shroud at all.If the reweave is largely in linen, why would there be any cotton added to it especially as this would make nonsense of an invisible reweave? Then there is the old question of why repair this part of the Shroud and not other areas which actually needed it.

I hardly think it is worth doing but if access is even given to the Shroud again, it would be interesting to make a study of the proportions of cotton in the different bands of the weave.  Again I have  never understood how Rogers knew there was no cotton elsewhere on the Shroud – I didn’t realise anyone had actually looked under a microscope to see – it would have been a long job to cover the whole Shroud!It is surely time to see the presence of the cotton fibres as irrelevant in terms of challenging the radiocarbon date.","date":"March 11, 2015 at 12:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Perhaps someone can quote from Rogers’ article the part where he shows that the threads themselves are different from the rest of the Shroud and the evidence he provides for this.

They were a tiny proportion of the whole and would not have much affected the dating if they had been left there, if there were indeed a different date from the main part of the cloth.So far as I know no one has examined the cloth in sufficient detail to see whether there are cotton fibres scattered around the rest of the Shroud.

I suppose that if fibres are found in other parts of the cloth and embedded in the yarn, it might be argued that this suggests a medieval date for the weaving as we know cotton and flax were processed in the same medieval workshops but let’s leave that until there has been a microscopic examination of the Shroud.I notice I have some leads from Joe Marino follow up and wonder whether they will answer my basic question why are these minute cotton fibres relevant to the carbon 14 dating?

It is that there were wide discrepancies in the thickness of the yearn used in weaving the Shroud- this was certainly not a top level cloth as Wilson seems to believe. If you look at a top level linen table cloth or napkin you can see how the yarns are the same thickness. In comparison the Shroud is rough and ready and simply for this reason there are anomalies throughout the original weave. Vial also noticed places where the weavers had made mistakes. Please read his article in the 1989 CIETA Bulletin.

We know that cotton and flax weavers worked together in the medieval period so the presence of tiny cotton fibres is hardly surprising.  Thibault has analysed several of the Raes threads and has done valuable work at confirming  that there are cotton fibres around but, as he shows, they only form a small part of the total linen. He provides no more than speculative evidence that there are cotton fibres further into the Shroud, into the area where the radiocarbon samples were taken. He seems to have found a thread or two that may have had the fibre drift in before or during the spinning, and so give the impression of being embedded.(N.B. Thibault- your articles don’t come up on my Mac but they do on my wife’s Mac! This was the case some weeks ago too so I transferred your articles then onto my computer.)I am not surprised Flury-Lemberg misunderstood Rogers’ article- it is very difficult to understand largely because it is so speculative and and has so few references to back his assertions, especially on vanillin. He suddenly talks about ‘pristine replacement material’ without saying what independent evidence of his own he has for this. No wonder, Flury-Lemberg took him, and Benford and Marino to task, asking simple questions such as ‘if there is reweaving ,where did it begin and end or was it an identical path to that taken out for the sampling’.But I come back to the question I asked at the beginning: what percentage of cotton is assumed to be in theC14 samples. Although I cannot find the evidence to back this in his articles ( please quote such evidence if I have missed it), Thibault has at least come up with a  clearly stated conclusion.‘The anomalous C14 corner is made of many “modern” (16 th century ?) blended cotton/linen THREADS mixed with few ancient linen threads (from the Shroud main part).In the “modern” blended threads both linen and cotton fibers are “modern”.’‘Many ‘ and ‘few’ seems rather vague but if we take  Benford and Marino’s 60 per cent new, 40 per cent old (which seems to give rather too high a figure for ‘few’), Thibault seems to be asserting that 60 per cent of the threads in the radiocarbon sale are blended linen/ cotton threads. I hope he will give fuller evidence for this blend and not why it has never been spotted by anyone. Thibault  asked : ‘Microscopic examination? By whom ? By the labs? No.’I could refer him to an article by somebody called Thibault Heimberger that reads as follows ‘In 1988, the textile experts looked at this area with binocular microscopes and later the laboratories [by this I assume he means all three of them]  performed some observations with the microscope on their samples.’Is it really possible that three laboratories missed the blended threads? They were ,after all, just testing what they had been given and there would have been no skin off their noses if the Shroud had proved to be a linen/cotton blend- after all such cloths were often made with alternative cotton and linen threads and they would simply have reported it as such.Has anyone else seen them?If there are blended threads in the C14 samples , what percentage of the blend is cotton? We return to Thibault’s analysis of one Raes thread, R7.‘Conclusion: there are many cotton fibers in the outer part [sic] of R7. However, it must be noticed that the total number of cotton fibers (23/96=24%) is certainly an overestimation because 1) it is difficult if not impossible to count exactly the number of fibers gathered in groups 2) many of the cotton fibers are small [sic] and certainly come from long cotton fibers which had been broken (perhaps during the handling process: cotton fibers are obviously more brittle than flax fibres).’ So if 24 per cent is an overestimation, let’s settle for 20 per cent, still probably too high. There is no evidence to support this at all but let’s assume that R7 is typical of the blended threads that Thibault argues make up the ‘modern’ repair. If we take the ‘modern’ threads at 60 per cent of the sample, and the cotton as making up 20 per cent of the ‘modern’, then we have a cotton content of some 12 per cent of the total sample. Yet, this was missed by the microscopic examination Thibault accepts that the labs undertook.Then there is the problem of why 20 per cent of cotton (and remember this is probably way too high) and no more was added to the linen. What would be the point of this if the majority of the addition was linen?I go back to my original conclusion that the cotton had drifted in as fibres, some of which were present when the flax was being spun, but overall the cotton is a red herring so far as radiocarbon dating is concerned because it formed too small a proportion of the total to sway the date in any significant way.","date":"January 26, 2014 at 6:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘He [Rogers] tested his the samples from the main body of the Shroud and found no (or only trace) Vanillin.’ One of the many problems with Rogers’ papers, is as Hugh pointed out, his lack of references to key assertions.

In 2002, Mechthild Flury-Lemberg, in charge of the restoration of the Shroud , also saw no reweave and published a paper pointing out that in her expert opinion there had never been any need to reweave that area anyway. (She specifically endorsed the work of Vial, saying that this was after all his specialist area.) She challenged the supporters of Rogers, Benford and Marino to show where the reweave began and ended.Flury-Lemberg was supported by John Jackson, a big  name among those who believe in authenticity,  who showed from the photographic evidence that the banding was intact and so,again, there had been no reweaving. I don’t have much time for Ian Wilson but some see him as the super-guru of Shroud studies and he also supports the idea of there not being a reweave.So the weight of expert opinion is overwhelmingly against any reweave. This makes the whole idea of dyed cotton redundant and if Rogers had thought through his speculation that the additions, ‘encrustations’ he called them, were dye he would have realised that it would not work in practice when there was so little cotton as a percentage of his proposed  reweave. But he was an ill man and can be forgiven! What is extraordinary is how uncritical those who read his paper have been. No one seems to question the idea of a dye and see how flimsy, or non-existent, was his evidence that the encrustations were a dye, rather than, say, a sealant.But enough said- responses to this  seem to be to cough and change the subject. Although I have been to Turin three times, gone through the Shroud Museum, been taken by the custodian to the chapel behind the museum to see the life-size copy of the Shroud there ( as well as the life-size one in the chapel next to San Lorenzo), I have never seen the original- so i will rest my case on those who have seen it close-up AND who dealt with ancient textiles as their professional career.","date":"January 27, 2014 at 3:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/21/cat-among-the-pigeons/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cat Among the Pigeons"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Lyfe- one more point- as you seem actually to have taken my argument on board!.When he examined the Shroud in 1988, in the two hours  while they were choosing the sample , Gabriel Vial looked over the whole cloth and took photos and then wrote an article in his findings for the French textile magazine CIETA Bulletin who published it the next year, 1989.

John Jackson, 2008: ‘While this hypothesis [the reweaving theory] has been argued on the basis of indirect chemistry [the Quad Mosaics?], it can be discounted on the basis of evident bandings in the 1978 radiographs and transmitted light images of STURP. These data photographs show clearly that the banding structures (which are in the Shroud) propagate in an uninterrupted fashion through the region that would, ten years later, be where the sample was taken for radiocarbon dating.’ In other words the undisturbed banding showed that this was the original cloth and had not been rewoven.Flury-Lemberg, ‘The Invisible Mending of the Shroud, the Theory and the Reality’, 2005.  Having argued  in this paper that invisible reweaving was always detectable by the trained eye, in particular because it could not be concealed at the back of a cloth, Flury-Lemberg noted that the fabric of the Shroud was in a good state of preservation and when she examined the corner where the radiocarbon sample had been taken, she reported that ‘its weaving structure is cohesive and untouched even at the corners. Therefore at no time has the need to reinforce the corner parts arisen!’   Flury-Lemberg concluded that ‘neither on the front nor on the back of the whole cloth is the slightest hint of a mending operation, a patch or some kind of reinforcing darning to be found.’If Lyfe is right in saying that Wilson also rejects the reweaving theory  then there is a lot of evidence against it, among the authenticists as well as sceptics.

End of story, or it should be but it won’t be!The more you read about gesso and primers the more clearly is that the variety of sealants on linens before they were painted is considerable, depending,I suppose ,on what was available. I did understand Cennini to mean that you expertly applied a very thin layer of gesso, left after scraping, so as to maintain flexibility.Everyone acknowledged the precarious nature of painted linens- which is why they were so cheap- inventories show that they were valued at about one twentieth to one tenth of a similarly painted wooden panel but you can’t fly a panel and a cloth was easier to carry about. In many recorded  cases, of course, the linens represented a cheap way of getting something for a specific one-off ceremony where long term durability did not matter.As I have continually said, we need an expert on these linens to get involved. Many studies of banners ( flexible ones) do mention various forms of sealant so that we know if happened and the ingredients of some have been analysed. The question is whether we can relate the aragonite , the calcium( carbonate?) , to a sealant of some kind.  The suggestion that the calcium was found across the whole cloth including non- image areas is suggestive of some overall sealant, and this might  provide the base for the images that we see so clearly in depictions of the Shroud especially after 1578 when visibility from afar was such an important part of getting the crowds in. ( See Beldon Scott on displaying the Shroud.)So long as no one else can provide any kind of other explanation for the images , I am sticking in this area as it seems the most probable explanation and ,as I have said numerous times before, I expect we will get some further support or dismissal within the next few years.Just off to California to see my son.

The only one the report gave as an example of rejection was one where two radiocarbon dates were 285 years apart and this was considered unacceptable. The sample was retested and a third date was finally considered acceptable ( some of the textiles were dated from the archaeological context in which they were found ).(This helps answer OK’s question.) There has also been a lot of retesting of material from Tell el Dab’a (the ancient Avaris) in Egypt. This is because of discrepancies of a hundred years that have arisen in attempting to date the eruption on the island of Thera (Santorini) that other dating methods date to c 1628 BC but some material at Avaris believed to be associated with the eruption carbon-dated to c. 1500 BC.More recent tests apparently show that the radio carbon was perhaps out a hundred years in 3600-3500 years but there have been problems with some of these older dates anyway.There are genuine problems areas- peat is one because samples can easily be mixed and it is difficult to unsort later peat that has become mixed with older peat. My limited experience of being on digs,many years ago, where samples were being elected for carbon dating is that one made very sure that samples were original/ uncontaminated  before they were sent off to an expensive lab. I can’t ever remember that more than one sample was sent from a single artefact – the trick, as the effort to select  the Shroud sample showed, was to get it right the first time. Cloth , as in the Coptic examples, is easier than peat to spot problems in because later material or material of a different textile can easily be spotted under a microscope and so one can be much surer than one has an original sample. and textiles are easier to clean from contamination than peat! This probably explains why the Coptic examples (mostly AD 400-1000)  have proved so accurate.The discrepancies tend to be in the order of a few percentage point- the discrepancy argued for the Shroud is way outside this – we are hardly dealing with the conventional and well known minor, but important, discrepancies of a hundred or two hundred years discussed above.","date":"February 2, 2014 at 11:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/02/it-was-a-single-procedural-screw-up-no-other-area-was-sampled-is-that-enough/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"It Was A Single Procedural Screw-Up.

So how do you rate (or did Currie rate)  the textile expert  Mechthild Flury-Lemberg’s rejection of Ray Roger’s, and others,’reweaving’ theory based on her own meticulous examination of the cloth? There are two reasons for placing her credibility higher than Rogers. 1) Textiles were her specialist field. 2) She was able to examine the shroud as a whole and would have spotted the reweaving if there had been. The quotations below are from her article that can easily be accessed on the British Society for the Turin website, Issue No.65, pp 10-27.‘The theory that repairs had been done to the corner areas in the Middle Ages, unfortunately is based on a false presupposition. The necessity of repairs to the corners has been postulated without ever examining the need for it. The real reason for the theory has been the desire to find a plausible explanation for the unsatisfying result of the carbon-14 analysis. Similar wishes, although understandable, have lead all too often in the history of the shroud to untenable theories. . . .Though the Turin shroud is burdened with the dust of centuries and with greasy dirt deposits on the corners its weaving structure is cohesive and untouched even at the corners. Therefore at no time has the need to reinforce the corner parts arisen! . . .Equally lacking any trace of evidence on the shroud is the hypothesis that a patch fixed onto the same minute spot which had been removed as a sample has falsified the result of the analysis. Where exactly had the patch been attached? How big was it? Was it so small that it covered only the sample area? Answers to these questions are lacking in the hypothesis of Benford/Marino and Rogers. They can only be given in a competent way by textile experts. One of them, who was present when the sample was taken, the late Gabriel Vial, confirmed repeatedly that the sample was taken from the original cloth! This affirmation seems to be unacceptable to a natural scientist [I assume she means Rogers et.al.] even if it comes from such an excellent textile scholar as Gabriel Vial who moreover made this judgment in his very own field of expertise.’","date":"September 18, 2012 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/08/19/los-alamos-national-laboratory-team-of-nine-scientists-prove-carbon-14-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin-wrong/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Los Alamos National Laboratory team of nine scientists prove carbon 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin wrong"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Yes, Hugh, you are being far too generous but I  am not criticising you as I know that if you, as a scientist which I am not, ever finds a single piece of scientific evidence that dates the Shroud to before AD1000 you will report it.

She made clear that it would have been impossible to conceal even a so-called invisible reweave, especially at the back of the cloth being rewoven. It is just possible that the experts who chose the sample just happened to cut neatly through the exact patch that had been rewoven and removed it, leaving no trace either side of the cut that there was any discrepancy.

So, leaving aside Jackson’s pre-1988 evidence for a moment, it must have been WITHIN the radiocarbon sample but no one has spotted it there.The only other alternative is that the sample team cut out the reweave section so cleverly that no one could see the original joins of old and new on either side of the cut.The basic point is that from Jackson onwards, no one has actually been able to spot and show with any kind of photographic evidence that there was a reweave.Even if there was one, which clearly there was not, there would be no reason why a fourteenth century weave might not have needed to be patched up in the sixteenth century.

That is someone who claims to be seeking the truth, but is really seeking instead to prove his or her own prejudgment.’I agree with John (yes,agreement!) that such people exist but it seems to me that you find them across the spectrum of Shroud studies. They are easy to spot because whenever anyone puts in material that challenges them, they get a bit hot under the collar. If the Shroud was put into a top conservation laboratory, such as that in the Metropolitan Museum, New York  or, if it is still running, Florence (set up after the 1966 floods), most of its ‘secrets’ would be revealed, or at least the problems clarified, in a couple of weeks with technology that is streets ahead of anything known in 1978 or 1988. Until then we are dealing with a lot of ambiguous evidence much of it produced by people who are working in disciplines that have nothing to do with ancient weaving.  So as far as the Shroud is concerned ‘we see through a glass darkly’ because we do not have enough evidence to do more.In my own work on the medieval church, I frequently come across inventories that talk of collections of linens and silks with images on them. An inventory of the contents of the basilica of Saint-Urbain in Troyes in 1468 listed 26 silk cloths with images on them. Yes, silk here, linen in other cases. Charles V of France (ruled 1364-78) owned 57 chapelles, sets of vestments or altar cloths, some of them, like the only survivor the Parement of Narbonne, painted in grey on silk for use in Lent. That is a thousand objects.Yet  the mere mention of an image on a cloth is often  taken to refer to the Shroud! (See Ian Wilson’s reference to the veneration of a cloth by the  Templars, for instance.)  We need to be much more critical of such claims until better evidence is found to link them specifically with the Shroud. Until then, I for one, will simply treat them as different cloths as we know that many such existed.","date":"October 24, 2013 at 12:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/meanwhile-part-2-works-for-me/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Meanwhile, Part 2:  “Works for Me”"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Dan I am sure that you would support, and I hope make strong moves to use your influence, to campaign for  a new radio-carbon -14 dating.

I am more interested in knowing about the looms ,ancient or medieval, that could have produced it and I am aware that this is a highly specialist area and I would defer to expert opinion.Still there is much basic work to be done. Contrary to what Ian Wilson tells us ,the Shroud is not a particularly fine linen cloth. Examples of linen with 40 to 70 warp and weft threads per cm are known from Egypt, Palestine and Syria in this period, much greater quality than the Shroud. (See the good article on weaving in the ancient eastern Mediterranean in the Cambridge History of Western textiles ( p, 110 for the figures).Again  if one looks at examples such as the Ramesses Girdle, now in Liverpool, of c. 1200 BC, which, even with computer help, has proved almost impossible to reweave, the Shroud is not especially complicated. So when one says that the Shroud is unique, it does not mean that one should say it is something special as a cloth so long as much finer and more complicated cloths from the ancient Mediterranean are known to exist. For me, the key problem is survival.

The Shroud seems to be a typical linen that was once painted with the linen surface being discoloured by centuries of gesso and paint being placed over it in the way that the medieval manuals laid down. Sadly Charlotte Villiers, an expert on painted linens, who saw the Shroud  as just this, died tragically young- I would have loved to ask her why she came to this conclusion about the Shroud.My own view is that Garlaschelli is being unnecessarily complicated as if the Shroud was somehow unique and not typical of its time when painted originally.I am in no rush to have my hypothesis proved as new research is continuing apace and I think that within the next five to ten years the Shroud will fit into the once painted linens category with experts agreeing on this. We will see. For the time being I am happy to  leave it up to the experts, in this case those who deal in a daily basis with ancient weaves and the conservation of the few painted linens that survive. The weavers tell me that the Shroud  is a typical  product of a medieval treadle loom as if there was no argument about it- the 113cms width is the give away as this was a common width in medieval cloth – the six linen strips of the Zittau Veil of 1472 sewn alongside each other  come to a total of 6.80 meters!As so often, time , developing technology and expertise will come up with fresh approaches- I think they will end up with a fourteenth century origin but what’s the rush when there is so much new work on ancient linens under way which will probably provide a definitive answer.","date":"November 23, 2015 at 4:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Mario- you would end to ask the experts in the conservation of painted linens but it would seem to be a gradual process o f disintegration depending on the original quality of the gesso and paint.

It beggars belief that no one thought of this at the time. For obvious reasons it is not acceptable  academic practice to scatter around pieces of an ancient object without insisting that they must be properly conserved and can be reunited with the original from which they were taken. I have every right to be frustrated with what appears to have happened with the scattering of evidence as anyone else studying the Shroud.I assume John would rule out any further tests on the tapes wherever they may be on the grounds that science has not advanced since 1978 so there is no point in having a new analysis of the tapes.John. While a professor of physiology who read for me all the papers I could find on the STURP blood findings declared them totally unconvincing, anyone who has read Caroline Walker Bynum’s Wonderful Blood will know the fascination with blood relics in the fourteenth century. There was a lot of Christ’s blood around, some of it dried, some liquid, many with stories of who collected it- Mary Magdalene was a favourite.Some of it fell from consecrated hosts (e.g. The Bolsena miracle) and under the  doctrine of transubstantiation was, of course, authentic, the real blood of Christ. To rule out the possibility that blood was added to the Shroud, either in the belief that it was the real blood of Christ, or to make it more awesome, is wrong.However as an expert in criminal investigations who had seen dried blood over thirty-five years told me when looking at close-ups of e blood stains. ‘ I can tell you for certain that that is not dried blood’ and when I asked him whether the blood of a terrified man differed from that of anyone else, he said that he had seen many blood stains from murdered bodies and there was no distinction.I may only be a historian who is a specialist in relic cults but I do at least seek independent expertise in areas that I have no specialist knowledge in and it would seem that the experts are not convinced by the STURP findings.

It deserves veneration in its own right.However, if it is authentic then each and every part of it has,under the Catholic doctrine of relics, established as early as the fourth century, the same power as the rest ( which is why you can cut up  saints’ bodies).

I have a professional reputation to defend, it has taken me years to build up and I am not going to risk it by publishing anything that will be ridiculed within the academic community, university presses and others who pay me money for my ‘expertise’.So writing on the Shroud, I made sure that I had a respectable journal but one where my article would be widely read, as it has been. I knew I could rely on HT to check it out for themselves but I had the whole read by an Oxford professor in medieval Christianity to make sure that it was academically respectable.I was warned that I might get hostile feedback from Shroudies for the article but the editor tells me that there has been virtually none. I have had one single letter forwarded to me unopened by HT and it was simply the face of the Shroud with a written caption offering me blessings. Instead I have had responses from many academics who have been supportive and I would be able to use material from some of them in future articles.As to blood, I have made it clear here that it would not surprise me in the least if there were blood human or otherwise on the Shroud. From the thirteenth century onwards there was a much greater emphasis on the sufferings of Christ and these were shown in various ways, by showing the Crown of Thorns still in place not only on the Cross but also in the deposition and burial, by emphasising blood stains and showing blood flowing along the arms, and by emphasising scourge  marks that covered the whole of Christ’s body. As often happened, many people jumped on the bandwagon and began producing relics of the blood of Christ, some of which were enormously popular. So it was that the monastery at Hailes was able to build their major building on the proceeds. So there was a lot of ‘Christ’s blood’ around and one would not be surprised to find some blood added to the Shroud.I had the following checked out :1) the tests for blood at the forensic laboratory at Modena. The tests done there should have shown up human blood if there had been any but they did not. Apparently it would be extraordinary but not totally impossible for the laboratory to have missed it.2) the articles by Heller and Adler and other supporting articles I could track down. These were read by a professor emeritus in physiology and were found totally unconvincing. For me this is quite sufficient and the fact that no one has taken the tapes and replicated the tests backs up his opinion. The professor noted that they probably mistook animal proteins. He offered to pass on the papers to a haematologist but could not believe there would be a difference of opinion.3) the same professor remarked that this was too red for dried blood and this has been confirmed by someone who has dealt over many years with bloodstains.I am quite happy on the basis of this to risk my reputation in the academic community within which I work by saying that, while human blood on the Shroud would hardly be surprising in the fourteenth century, no significant replicated evidence has been found to support that there was.  I shall just have to live with the contrary opinion of the lawyer John Klotz and I will try not to lose sleep over it.","date":"March 17, 2015 at 12:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am totally mystified by the Challenge unless David Rolfe can provide Richard Dawkins and his assembled team of textile experts with a scientific laboratory at the Challenge’s own expense and  permission to take the Shroud there for a full examination.

I do actually provide an example of a cloth fold four times while he can only manage three to produce a cloth divided not into four (see further below) but into eight.Early Christianity (one of my fields) is littered with examples of austere Christians complaining of less austere Christians following pagan customs especially in celebrations. Pope Leo I complains of Christians worshipping the sun from the steps of St. Peter’s, others complain of the continuing pagan festival feasts around the tombs of the martyrs (see Ramsey MacMullen’s The Second Church on this), there are complaints of ‘pagan’ candles being lit at martyrs’ shrines, the whole idea of transferring vast quantities of money , gold and mosaic into church buildings is essentially pagan- certainly not Christian – as Jerome complained!! What about the Esquiline treasure =, a Christian marriage chest with a naked Venus on the top!! So the overlap is greater than you seem to imply, but , as you will have seen, I raised the question of whether the pallium, which has been described as folded, is another ceremony transferred from a pagan precedent. So my argument is not ‘utterly absurd’. A pagan world becoming Christian still lived in pagan mindsets- just as much of modern Christmas celebrations have absolutely nothing to do with the Christian story.We may not have another record of tetradiplon , but if you have studied your lexicon you will know that using tetra- as a prefix was very common. i still work from my great-grandfather’s 1865 lexicon but I gave up counting after I had read through eighty examples – I think there must be some 150 as i was only half-way through. i am surprised that no one, so far as i know, has been through this before so that some comparisons between tetradiplon and other ‘tetras’ can be made.So if you take tetra together with some action you get tetraelix, ‘four times wound or twisted round’,  tetrapalinon, ‘ a fourfold lace or string; or tetrapalos ‘ploughed four times’, There are many examples of tetra being used of objects divided into four  but as Wilson has a cloth divided into eight this does not help him- he should have stuck to two foldings!. I leave it to the Greek scholars to take this on further (none that I referred my article to have suggested my translation is wrong) but there are certainly enough examples to suggest that tetradiplon is likely to refer to four ACTS of doubling and we have the Parthenon example to show that cloth was actually subject to such acts of doubling in a major ceremony.I have to close now as I am on the road lecturing in Italy – on site with a group of 25 at the early Christian mosaics at Aquileia next Wednesday!-until the middle of November.","date":"October 20, 2012 at 4:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/bsts-meeting-reminder/","cat":"event","title":"BSTS Meeting Reminder"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S. One of the scholars of Byzantine literature who knows the original texts in Greek replied to me as follows:‘It is still not clear to me if tetradiplon means “folded four times” or “folded in fourths.” The latter would imply folding only twice. Wilson’s theory involves three foldings,  resulting in eight sheets. The only explanation I can think of how this explains the word tetradiplon is that he’s referring only to the third folding in which 4 sheets are folded over to form 8. In other words, 4 X 2 = 8.’But I don’t think Wilson says anything about referring to ONLY the third folding. One must remember that Wilson is not a scholar of ancient Greek and one must refer to those who are on these matters. He seems to have been caught in an impossible position, neither folded into fours, nor folded four times (as the Parthenon cloth was).I can only repeat what I have said, and more eloquently than I , Yannick Clement, that until one clears away the deadwood of Wilson/Scavone and Guscin one is never going to make any further progress in Shroud studies.","date":"October 20, 2012 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/bsts-meeting-reminder/","cat":"event","title":"BSTS Meeting Reminder"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Ron: ‘Four-doubled.

I assume you have read  my article so that you know what we are talking about.I am pleased to find something we agree on because if tetradiplon is translated as ‘four doubled’ as you suggest this rules out Wilson’s hypothesis that only describes a three doubled cloth. – tridiplon, I suppose.Let’s take it gently.1) If you have a handkerchief to hand , lie it flat and then fold it double four times. You will be able to do it. So tetradiplon, if translated as ‘four doublings’ , is possible for even a small cloth. So unless we have some other information we would not know the unfolded size of any cloth described as tetradiplon.2) We have a LEGENDARY account of Jesus wiping his face with a cloth that was described as tetradiplon before he wiped his face with him with no reference to it being folded tetradoplon afterwards. It is legendary because it describes an event taking place in the first century BC before the death of Jesus, so before AD 30, when there is no evidence for Christianity in Edessa before the end of the second century. So like all legends this is imagined. If this was simply a face cloth ,the writer of Acts of Thaddeus must have imagined it as small when folded but big enough to contain an image of a face when unfolded. We know nothing more about his imagination other than that he lists the burial cloths of Jesus separately later in his account and here he seems to have drawn on the gospel accounts to supplement his legendary account.3) We have an ACTUAL illustration of a cloth that is folded tetradiplon from the relief on the Parthenon so we know that such foldings did happen.That is what we have to go on.","date":"October 20, 2012 at 4:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/bsts-meeting-reminder/","cat":"event","title":"BSTS Meeting Reminder"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"110  3) continued:   In this case we can see what the original cloth would be in size by working out, in relation to the characters on the frieze, the size of the cloth as shown and then working from there to calculate  its full size when unfolded.

The interest is, of course, that this shows a cloth folded tetradiplon BEFORE being used in a ceremonial role and the Acts of Thaddeus also describe a cloth that is tetradiplon BEFORE it plays a part in the ceremony of wiping Christ’s face.I am not saying that I am right in this case , although i have had strong support for my thesis from those I circulated it to before publishing it,  but as soon as one rejects the Wilson hypothesis as being a non-starter there are lots of avenues to explore.But, and this is the topic at hand, will the British Shroud meeting be a place when anyone opens up new avenues of research or will it be one when the old arguments are simply recycled and everyone pats themselves on the back.

In my book Holy Bones, Holy Dust, How Relics Shaped the History of Medieval Europe, just out now in paperback, I fail to find a single medieval relic that dates back to the first century, although all the artefacts, cloths, etc listed in the gospels  certainly existed at some point. There is no record that early Christians collected relics before the fourth century, having a very similar attitude to them that most Protestants have today, and most must have perished due to natural causes in the humid atmosphere of Jerusalem.However I would stand to gain immensely if the Shroud is ever proved to be authentic as it would enable me to write a revised edition of my book with a sensational new cover that would probably earn me good money.My own feeling is that if retested the Shroud would come back with a medieval date, possibly a bit earlier.  With modern methods of removing contamination,it is impossible for so much contamination to remain that it would skew a 1350 (say) date back to the first century. The first century date is what matters,any other date, say AD 500, just confirms that this is a later creation. We know of many relics that first appear in the ninth century ,for instance, and you know of two separate tests on the Oviedo sudarium that took it back only to AD 700 (I only knew of one of these tests so it is useful to know that there is a second that confirms the first).If you are looking for large cloths the size of the Shroud, the best examples are the cloths made in Islamic workshops in the ninth to eleventh centuries. Several of these were brought back to Europe by Crusaders- notably the shroud of Cadouin.I have had one useful conversation with a textile expert who thinks this is a possible source for the Shroud and would explain why there may be traces of plants, etc, from the Middle East on the Shroud. Unfortunately I have been unable to make contact with the French expert on Islamic cloth whose name i was given to explore this further. I don’t know how the Islamic cloths were woven and the first step would be to see if they used the same methods as shown on the Shroud.The Romans were cruel in their methods of execution , later generations no less so and it is not impossible that ,taking the gospels as a source, someone recreated an actual crucifixion of some unfortunate man and then wrapped him up so as to sell the bloodstained cloth to a gullible crusader.Further testing of the blood on the Shroud is essential. if an AB blood-grouping is confirmed this has to be squared with the evidence that this grouping is not known before AD 900.I am sticking to a medieval date as the best fit without ruling out the small possibility that the cloth is a lone survivor of an earlier period.

I think the AB blood grouping of the Shroud  is well reported.I have argued that this test should be done again with the latest techniques of blood analysis to confirm this result – and,of course, find out very much more about the blood and genetic inheritance of the person wrapped in the Shroud.In an earlier posting on this site I cited the Hungarian evidence that showed how AB grouping first appeared quite late, post 900. This was done from careful analysis of burials in an area where the mingling of Mongoloid and Caucasian groups took place which led to the emergence of an AB grouping from what were previously blood groupings of B and A.I am sorry I have not the time to find which posting it was on but perhaps someone else remembers it. If I find it I will repost it here, of course.If anyone else has conclusive evidence of any AB blood grouping from before AD 900 it would be good to know as i have never seen one. The mingling of Mongoloid and Caucasian groups took place in the areas where they came into contact  and there are several of these including the Far East which are perhaps earlier.

We need to know whether just the cloth was dated or the blood stains as well. if the blood stains are shown to be AB and are dated to AD 700 then we do indeed have the earliest reference to an AB blood grouping that I have ever heard of and this would be significant. As the mingling of A and B groups as a result of documented migrations from the east are rare this early this might also give a clue as to where the ‘donor’ of the blood on the Sudarium came from. There would be very few places indeed where the emergence of AB groupings would have been possible. I have been told that although one might find examples fo AB from AD 900 it was not until more extensive minglings of A and B blood groups between 1000 and 1100 that it becomes more common.As said in another post, the evidence comes from the plains of Hungary where the first recording mingling of A and B blood groups which led to the emergence of the AB blood grouping seems to have taken place in the ninth and tenth centuries. As i understand it, analysis of bones from earlier burials have shown no trace of AB before this. I am lucky to have a Hungarian friend who lectures on medical history and I have asked him for help on this as I suspect that much of the research is in Hungarian.Suppose the Shroud was AD 1350 there would be no problem about the AB blood grouping as , even though it was carried only by a small minority of the population and most prominent in areas where A and B groups intermarried, there were still a significant number with this blood-grouping around.If the blood on the Shroud is shown to be much earlier it becomes, to me, a much more interesting question so I look forward to hearing more from the experts on this.I leave it to others to discuss the theological problems arising from the analysis of the blood of a man who is assumed to have had a human mother and a divine father.

I have seen so many conflicting discussions by scientists and pseudo-scientists on the Shroud and, as I am not a scientist myself , I am quite happy to accept as a good possibility  that the Shroud contains an image of  a man who has been crucified , either Jesus himself , or someone tortured to death by someone who had the gospel description of his death.The real question then is the date of this occurrence.  I am simply not convinced by the argument based on the Vignon markings that the Byzantine images of Christ are derived from the Turin Shroud. I have recently been writing the third edition of my Egypt, Greece and Rome that includes art. I argue there , conventionally (it is a conventional book based on standard sources designed for beginner students in universities) , that the fully frontal faces of Christ are derived from imperial art. You can see this in the San Pudenziana mosaic in Rome of c. 390 ( some say later, possibly 420) where Christ is shown in full, front on and with a beard,as an imperial magistrate. In the Ravenna mosaic,where I follow scholars such as Robert Cormack in dating it to probably AD 500, this point is made even clearer as Christ is draped in imperial purple. So the model for the Byzantine Christs seems to be the emperors, not a burial cloth. This ‘liberates’ the Turin Shroud and means that it can be of any date, from the first century AD up to its first mention in the fourteenth century.So then we need to apply other tests and here we seem to agree on a new carbon-14 dating. I still think that this is by far the most likely way of settling the issue. Even taking a worst case scenario if another date well after AD 30 is achieved I think this will be adequate proof for me that the Shroud is not authentic.I also want to get to the bottom of two other issues.1) If the bloodstains are AB, then we need to square this with the evidence that AB only appears in the historical record after AD 900. The best evidence for this comes from Hungary and , in reply to another post from Gabriel,I am now waiting for a Hungarian doctor friend of mine who lectures in the history of medicine in Hungary to give me his views on AB. I am not able to comment on how accurate the AB testing is although I am assured that it is. Even so I would argue for another testing of the blood using the latest techniques which are miles ahead, apparently, of even those of ten years ago, As I have said elsewhere we need to know everything we can about the blood group and genetic inheritance of the blood (however many theological problems that arise from it -would it show the DNA of God the Father?)2) Although I think it is unlikely to lead anywhere, i would like to do a comparative study of the Shroud with the linen cloths of similar size that were woven in the caliphs’ Egyptian workshops between the 9th and 11th centuries. We know of two that came to Europe from these looms that still survive and there were were probably many more in view of the heavy traffic of crusaders and pilgrims going to and from the Holy Land. Many were very gullible and brought back fakes believing that they were the genuine relics found on the sites where they have been used. There would have born evidence of these ‘relics” origins, possibly in the shape of pollen,etc, that can be traced back to Middle East sources. It is argued that the Shroud also bears such evidence and so a Middle East origin at the time of the Crusades is a possibility that, at the very least, needs to be ruled out.However, you and i stand together on the issue that first brought me into this discussion, the  impossibility of Wilson’s arguments ,all of which fail as soon as they are analysed.

It was the CHEST (unopened) not the Sudarium that dated back to the seventh century. The sources were often later than the opening of the Chest.

You left Hungary out of your table where the incidence of AB is the highest in Europe at 8 per cent. This is precisely why studies of the emergence of AB have been concentrated here. It is clear from the incidence that there was a swathe of central Europe from Finland in the north to Turkey in the south where Mongoloid B people met with Caucasian A people and that eventually sexual mingling took place leading to the new AB grouping. This why you have ,second to Hungary, Turkey at 7.2 per cent, and Czechoslovakia and Poland at 7 per cent AB. ( In contrast if you go further west, France and the UK are only 3 per cent ,Spain 2.5 per cent, Ireland 2 per cent AB)It was the occupation of the Carpathian Plain by the Magyars in 895 that is seen by some as the crucible where the mingling took place which is why a date of c. AD 900 is often given as the start of AB groupings with these becoming more intensive  between 1000 and 1100 (which is why some accounts talk of a thousand years since the emergence of  significant AB groupings). One genetic website states as follows:’The blood group AB represents less than 5% of the world’s population. Resulting from unions of European populations of group A and of Mongol population of group B, this group is very “young”, since it has been in existence for only 10 to 15 centuries.

There were other areas ,of course, where Mongoloids and Caucasians intermarried- in China , Korea, southern India and across central Europe from Finland Poland, Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, Turkey etc..Obviously AB has nothing to do with race because it arises from a mixture of different racial groups.That was always a non-starter.Since 1000 there have been further migrations of AB and  so there are populations of AB  blood groupings in areas of migration, especially from central Europe. It would be interesting to know how many of the Israeli AB population had their origins in Jewish migrations from central Europe.Still no evidence of any AB grouping before AD 900 – apparently when it was first found in Hungary- we need to keep searching for evidence. I shall stay with the emergence of AB 1000 to 1100  years ago until i see clear evidence of an earlier dating of the emergence which I shall be happy to accept.

I think that the first thing to do is to assemble all the  examples pre-AD 800 of faces of Christ that are assumed  to have Vignon markings and place them on a map with colour-coding by date ( e.g. to 50 years).  You will have to accept than many will have decayed with time and others destroyed by iconoclasts but you may have a big enough sample to begin work. As I understand it Stephen Jones accepts the earliest Vignon markings as being of a Christ in the Catacomb of Marcellinus in Rome. Does one include the San Pudenziana Christ in Rome of c 390-420 as having Vignon markings?  It seems generally assumed that the Ravenna Christ of c. 500 also has Vignon markings. Can you see the point I am making – that the earliest examples of Vignon markings may be not far from each other in Italy and thus, if the Shroud was the source, this would suggest it was in Italy that early. e.g, before 500.The earliest examples that Wilson can come up with are post 550. Of course, with the fall of the Roman empire the west was partly cut off from the east but our study might show conclusively that Vignon markings appeared in Italy before they did in the east and this would be significant.I don’t understand Vignon markings because i cannot see them in the Turin Shroud but others obviously can spot them without difficulty so perhaps they can work together to compile the images that they believe contain the markings and let us have the result on a map.","date":"October 14, 2012 at 11:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/bsts-meeting-reminder/","cat":"event","title":"BSTS Meeting Reminder"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"No one denies the problem of contamination.

It is radio-carbon 14 dating in 2012 that is important and goodness knows how much more sophisticated the procedures for dealing with the biggest problem of all, contamination, have become since 1988. There are full-time scientific professionals working over many years dealing with just this problem of contamination. One big leap forward has been in dealing with waterlogged material where the water dissolved the C-14 do leading to a false, older, reading. This can apparently,according to the section on radio-carbon14 dating in Bahn and Renfrew’s Archaeology ( 2012) now be dealt with.I have seen several papers on the 1988 testing that suggest the impact of contamination may have skewed the result but no one seems agreed on what specifically the contamination was and no one has been able to show that, after the cleaning process undertaken by the three different laboratories, so much contamination remained that it brought a 1350 reading to a first century cloth. More than this, even though the anti-contamination programmes in the three labs were different ,all still ended up with dates in the medieval era, long,long past the first century.I assume that some evidence of contamination would show up on the  photos of the Shroud if it were significant- does it?It is isn’t a question of whether someone is a Shroudie or not because this is a purely scientific question.

The contamination alone, if of 2010, would have to be twice the quantity of the first century cloth and if the contamination was earlier  it would have to be even more than that. Yet one of the points John Tyrer makes is that the blood was the only liquid that seeped further down into the cloth, suggesting that contamination further into the cloth is limited. For me, it does not add up.I agree with Ron that a precise date of the Shroud might be difficult to achieve but we are not primarily interested in precision, we are first and foremost concerned whether imprecise date ranges rule out anything as early as the first century.That’s what I am interested in for starters and then, if so, one needs to follow up other leads. I still think the large cloths from the Middle Eastern workshops of the caliphs (ninth to eleventh centuries0 are important to rule out too before we go further.

I have had to study the issue with the dating of the Thera eruption because it is one of the case studies for my introductory ‘textbook’ to the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, Greece and Rome.  Here  radio-carbon and other forms of dating come to the late seventeenth century BC  but this conflicted with the Egyptian chronology of c 1500 BC. This is a classic study case for students of archaeology especially of ancient chronology because several different dating methods are being used against each other. There has been an immense amount of new radio-carbon dating in Egypt  to try and sort this out. As Bahn and Renfrew state  in their Archaeology, p. 155, ‘A major new programme of radiocarbon determination using well-stratified finds associated with specific pharaohs has recently yielded dates  earlier than previous historical estimates . . . and makes more likely the early date of around 1610 BC for the eruption’. So gradually thanks to the ever greater sophistication of radio-carbon14 dating, its application to a wide range of materials and its correlation with other dating methods – tephra studies, ice core studies, dendrochronology, (which, of course, help confirm that the radio-carbon14 dating is accurate) are producing a consensus for the later seventeenth century for the eruption.But the discrepancy in an event that took place 3,600 years ago was only 125 years at the most- enough to be a worry and require intense extra investigation (because of the threat to traditional Egyptian chronology) but nothing compared to the 1350 AD versus AD 30 discrepancy claimed for a much more recent piece of material.  (Remember that r-c dating is used back to 50,000 years ago and so a lot of the problems that seem to be raised by disputants here are with the extreme age of the samples. Compared to these, the problems of dating a piece of cloth only  600-2,000 years old are elementary.)On the Islamic cloths,  two examples we have in Europe (brought back from the Middle East by Crusaders) are the Veil of Anne at Vaucluse (dated to c. 1095) and the Cadouin Shroud, both are similar in size to the Turin Shroud (which is why they are of immediate interest) but, so far, I have had no information on how they were woven or how Islamic cloth in general was woven in these workshops. I have recently been in istanbul at the Museum of Islamic Art and they have a wonderful collection of Ottoman weaving but i didn’t see anything earlier than the thirteenth century.(Of course the Ottomans had nothing to do with the Crusades but ‘Turkish ‘rugs were common in Europe after the sixteenth century as their great quality was recognised and the Museum has examples of them in Renaissance paintings)","date":"October 16, 2012 at 6:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/bsts-meeting-reminder/","cat":"event","title":"BSTS Meeting Reminder"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"With thanks also to this recent (what a nice surprise !) paper by Kelly Kearse on the bloodstains on the Shroud.

The issues that any serious researcher on the Shroud,and there are many who claim to be such, need to be aware of are 1) That good-sized cloths (Cadouin Shroud 281 cms by 113 cms). the Veil of Anne at Apt ( 310 cm by 152 cms) were being brought back as relics by Crusaders- both these cloths are now dated to c.1095.They are obviously only a tiny proportion of what was being produced in linen, wool and silk as the paragraph below makes clear. 2) The apparent presence of pollen,etc, from the Middle East on the Shroud is another potential link to these workshops.So far as I can see no one in Shroud studies has seriously researched this area. The only textile expert I have talked, in the Victoria and Albert Museum textile department, thought there was a lot of potential here.“Faced with a technically weakened West after the Barbarian invasions and the protectionist silk trade of Byzantium, Muslim lands developed their own textile art and to a very high degree that matched their vibrant interest for the art. The circumstances were ripe: The conquests of the first centuries had joined in one block Spain, the Maghreb, the Byzantium Near East and the Sassanid Empire. A vigorous manufacturing activity thus fell into the hands of the Arabs—in Alexandria, Tyre and Antioch with their trade in twill—and that of the Fayums who specialised in linen cloth used as a ground weave in tapestries. This area of the trade thus opened up; natural resources circulated freely and a flourishing exchange of repertories and procedures ensued, along with the cultivation of textile fibres and plants used in dyeing.  Egypt and North Africa developed a culture of indigo and Spain saffron. Traditional textiles such as wool and linen began to evolve as new textiles entered into the picture such as cotton and silk, which propagated from East to West. Silkworm breeding in Byzantine Syria, launched by Justinian (6th c.), was acclimatised in the Spanish Levant and in the North of Sicily. In Andalusia it gave birth to an industry of luxury goods based in Almeria. The weaving of lampas, which appeared in Baghdad in the eleventh century, slowly entered the textile trade in Syria, Egypt and Spain and replaced that of the Samit. The Latin West followed suit. With the vibrant growth of cities following the Muslim expansion, the luxury of the courts and the needs of the army and the navy, textile production expanded rapidly. The new capitals of Fustat, Kairouan, Raqqada, Sabra Mansuriyya, Mahdia, Fez, Madinat al-Zahra, Cairo—and much later Marrakech—were among the centres that consumed and created textiles, having also the highest concentration of specialised labour.  In the markets, the muhtasib (the controller), his manual always handy, would keep a close watch on the quality of the textile goods in an effort to stabilise prices. His large lexicon of fabrics covered information from procedures, the places of fabrication and sales to details about decorative motifs. And while these terms are not exhaustive when it comes to identifying all of the techniques employed, they do reveal the impact and importance of this art in Muslim culture, a civilisation that is sometimes referred to as the civilisation of textiles.”","date":"October 17, 2012 at 4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/bsts-meeting-reminder/","cat":"event","title":"BSTS Meeting Reminder"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Thanks, Diana.

I was interested to read on p. 59 of David Sox’s The Shroud Unmasked that during the 1978 tests there were several requests to touch articles on the Shroud. In particular,  there was an English lady (unnamed) who brought a bunch of flowers and one of them, a rose, was indeed laid on the Shroud and returned to the lady.  This cannot have been the only case where this happened and , as happened in many similar cases, one should expect to find later additions to the Shroud from all this touching. It makes any analysis of material gathered from the surface very problematic. But this point has already been made of the pigments – assumed by some members of STURP to have been later additions from painted cloths. I have my doubts (if the pigments fell onto the Shroud ,why did they not fall off again when it was next exhibited)  but at least the principle that surface materials may be later additions is here accepted. The real problem with additions to the Shroud is that in the late sixteenth and throughout the seventeenth century, the Shroud was brought out and displayed almost every year so most earlier material would have fallen off if it were loose.","date":"September 10, 2015 at 3:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/08/new-youtuibe-presentation-is-the-shroud-of-medieval-forgery/","cat":"presentation","title":"New YouTube Presentation:  Is the Shroud a Medieval Forgery?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Matthew- don’t rule out the possibility that the pollen was brought back from the Holy Land by pilgrims – just as people are still bringing back water from the River Jordan.

I appreciate the space you give to a sceptic who nevertheless appreciates that there are mysteries surrounding the Shroud that leave many aspects of  its provenance and creation open.I have consistently argues that the Wilson /Edessa trail is a false one without sufficient evidence to sustain it. i feel that it has been accepted far too uncritically. However, by discarding it we open up new possibilities of research that have not,so far as I can see, been properly explored. Wilson has acted as a deadweight on research.I leave aside the scientific aspects as I am not qualified to judge them but the following are possibilities.1) If the Shroud originated in Jerusalem, one needs to explore the other routes by which it may have come into Europe- these would include its arrival among the relics we know we transferred DIRECT from Jerusalem to Constantinople in the fourth and fifth centuries. We also need to look more thoroughly at the relic lists of the Fourth Crusaders to see if there is anything in them than could be seen as a Shroud- as well  earlier references to cloth being given by the Byzantine emperors as gifts at least one of which is referred to as a shroud.  Then there are the many relics brought direct to Europe from Jerusalem after its capture in the First Crusade (1099) such as the Shroud of Cadouin (though this is known to be eleventh century). The reports of pollen from the Middle East on the Shroud are relevant here.2) There is a lot of talk about weaves, linings and stitchings. These need to be brought together to provide a clearer picture of when similar weaves to those of the Shroud were being produced and by whom. It is commonly said that similar weaves and stitchings from the first century  are known- I would like to see pictures of these but also place them in the wider context of similar weavings from other centuries.3). The sudarium of Oviedo was only part of a cache of relics that were together in a chest in 1075. Do the others still survive? What light would they shine on the sudarium if examined properly?4) There are 150 Greeks words, at least, beginning with tetra-almost every one relates to ‘four’ .Would an analysis of these bring us closer to understanding tetradiplon? Similarly there seem to interesting possibilities in examining the uses of Greek words beginning with ‘dipl’ such as ‘diploe’, etc.There are many more areas to research. There are many contributors to this blog who say they are ‘shroud researchers’ (although it is depressing to see how many of these seem to be repeating  Wilson’s hypotheses without producing any insights of their own – I was especially frustrated by de Wesselow’s claim that he had worked on the Shroud for six years but I have not found any genuine new research in his book, The Sign!) so I hope they can take on these points. Although I have my own doubts about the early dating of the Shroud, none of these avenues of research is incompatible with the Shroud  being authentic. It just needs the readiness to break out of the Wilson mindset to breathe new life into the subject.","date":"October 21, 2012 at 11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/on-the-day-of-the-bsts-meeting/","cat":"event","title":"On the Day of the BSTS Meeting"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"DaveB. Thanks for this useful article. There still seems some surprise about early weaving although this has been one of the main activities of communities since the earliest times (the earliest archaeological evidence for a woven cloth now goes back 25,000 years) and very well documented even when examples do not survive- e.g. the vast number of depictions of woven clothing on Greek vases- the size of which can be easily measured, just as can the peplos of 430s BC shown on the Parthenon frieze. Looms are shown on vases and there are lots of literary references to wool workers in the Greek world  from Homer onwards (and much earlier in the Middle Eastern sources where textile making was probably the largest industry). Everyone wore clothes that were woven. I don’t know what Diana Fulbright does not draw on the mass of this other evidence but only on the tiny and probably unrepresentative samples that survive. That is why i argued above for the wider context.By the time of Jesus weaving  was considered to be the mark of the virtuous stay-at-home woman and the emperor Augustus (died AD 14) insisted that his wife Livia should be at home supervising the in-house weaving.The problem is  the same forms of weaving persisted for generations so that Gilbert Raes, as quoted by Diana Fulbright , states:“The type of weave [the herringbone pattern of the Turin Shroud] is not particularly distinctive and does not enable us to determine the period in which it was produced” .That is the problem- although the Shroud is fine linen the weave does not stand out as especially distinctive. As Prof. Fulbright shows, via Flury-Lemburg, that the Shroud weave is known in the Tyrol as far back as 800 BC and there are certainly medieval examples ,so one has  a long time span.I notice that Prof. Fulbright appears to use radio-carbon dates for  cloth up to 6000 BC without comment  – so there is SOMEONE who believes it is a relevant way of dating cloth.","date":"October 22, 2012 at 4:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/on-the-day-of-the-bsts-meeting/","cat":"event","title":"On the Day of the BSTS Meeting"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I partially take your point  but Fulbright weakens her argument for a Jerusalem source for the Shroud by giving, at the end of her article, examples of a similar weave to the Shroud from the Tyrol, southern England, Sweden, Dura-Europus , Egypt and Pompeii, thus showing it was a common weave throughout Europe and as far east as Dura-Europus. So what does this tell us? Just that, as Raes noted, it is impossible to date or allocate the place of manufacture of the Shroud from the weave alone so that approach needs to be abandoned. As DF has accepted the radio-carbon dates for her, much older , samples without comment, I assume she would be happy to use them on the Shroud itself.Incidentally Google Images :’ Looms Greek vases’ will show that large pieces of cloth could be woven and there should be similar evidence in H. Ling Roth’s Ancient Egyptian and Greek Looms. I don’t know where the idea that only small cloths could be woven in ancient times ever came from.","date":"October 22, 2012 at 4:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/on-the-day-of-the-bsts-meeting/","cat":"event","title":"On the Day of the BSTS Meeting"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Louis- yes they say they are open to all on their website, but I seem only be able to find articles that support the authenticity of the Shroud in their material, so the image that they project is pro-authenticity.

I am not presenting an argument – it is simply that these were very different shrines with different functions and collections. The collection of relics in the imperial palace was well protected and survived the 1204 sacking. The Blachernae chapel was open to the public with regular processions and displays of its relic collections ( as seen by de Clari). It got sacked in 1204 as it was so exposed on the coastline and a long way from the centre of town. There is absolutely no evidence or reason for moving a relic from the safety of the imperial palace  ( where the emperors jealously guarded their impressive collection)to the exposed Blachernae in these troubled years.Access Holger Klein’s website and read his long article on the imperial relic collections.Anyway there is no reason why Jack  Markwardt should not make a presentation that reflects the evidence as we know it. I would assume that he knows Klein’s work and perhaps that authority on the relics of Constantinople might even be prepared to be consulted. This is what I meant earlier about involving independent experts.Apart from researching the direct links between Northern France and Jerusalem in the relic ‘trade’, there really does need to be some more work done on linen weaving as it seems to have been neglected recently but new evidence of ancient and medieval cloth is accumulating all the time and , again, there would surely be someone who would be prepared to share what is going on.","date":"June 2, 2014 at 11:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/01/program-and-presenters-for-the-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference/","cat":"event","title":"Program and Presenters for the St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Another point to clarify.

Kaeuper and Kennedy’s introduction to de Charny’s Chivalry  (1996) suggest it was Jeanne who transformed what had been an icon into a relic. This would make the Shroud  analagous to the Shroud of Besancon whose status changed  when a man was apparently brought back from the dead in its presence.This simply made it a object of veneration which is the same status the Church gave in the 1390s and still gives to the Shroud. The question of a fake does not come into it as there were many objects that were never believed to be the originals but which were associated with miracles.I suspect that this is how the Shroud began its spiritual life- and this is certainly what Kaeuper and Kennedy argue.I am quite happy for daveb to offer a critique of my ‘Misguided Journey ‘ if he wishes to do so – I am not sure whether he has read it yet. I cannot see why i should think I am wrong until there is some alternative evidence provided that trumps mine. Again and again when I checked Wilson’s sources I found that they were wrongly used. His claim that the word tetradiplon was used of the Shroud AFTER Jesus wiped his face on it instead of before is just one instance in his 2010 book. And it does not take long to dismiss the Pray Codex- there is a stepped pyramid pattern on the tomb cover, not a herringbone, and the holes are circular not ragged as the poker holes on the Shroud are. The ROUND holes are found in several depictions of the tomb lid as there were actually round holes drilled into the Sepulchre in Jerusalem  which were copied by artists.I suspect that the reason why no one has followed up the French connections is that no one was aware of them. I refer you to Michael McCormick’s Origins of the European Economy, Cambridge, 2001. He studies the early relic trade in France in detail and on page 303, he lists relics that are found at Sens, only 90 kilometres from Lirey,  that came in from Jerusalem the eighth century.  There are three specific relics listed as having come from the ‘Lord’s tomb’. This shows that there was a direct link between Jerusalem and northern France in the relics trade including relics from the tomb. Now if that is not evidence that deserves further exploration i don’t know what is.

It would seem that sindon could not be translated here as burial cloth as it has no relationship with the empty tomb of the gospels. The second reference to a cloth in the Acts specifically refers to the burial cloths  from the tomb and this confirms  that the first sindon cannot be Jesus’ burial cloth.Yet Dan Scavone may yet surprise us all by bringing up a meaning of sindon that does allow it to be translated as ‘burial cloth’ in the first context.","date":"June 11, 2014 at 12:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/11/anticipating-the-conference-dan-scavone-on-evidence-of-the-shroud-in-edessa/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Dan Scavone on Evidence of the Shroud in Edessa"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"There is a real problem here. paper after paper is going to be rolled out in St. Louis,one half hour after another ( in some cases the Abstract seems half an hour long in itself!)

The reason is that the silk shimmers in the light.Extensive studies of this weave shows no example before a few silk fragments in the third century AD which had, of course, to be made on very special looms. The standard ancient twill is 2/2 but shrouds.e.g. those from ancient Israel tend to be plain weave, as detailed by Omit Shamir in the article on Israeli textiles posted on this site recently .Hugh is right that fabrics of extraordinary quality were produced in the Middle Ages, far finer than the Shroud.  The density of the weave is not exceptional among other painted cloths where 38 threads in both warp and weft can be found.e.g. finer than the Shroud weave.Linen was the downmarket fabric, compared to ,say, silk. The Cistercians deliberately had their vestments made in linen as part of their rejection of the opulence of normal church vestments. We have quite a lot of prices from inventories and a painted linen was worth about as tenth as much as the same picture painted on board.

I am amazed that his advisers did not point out the emergence of the bearded image of Christ much earlier in Rome. It is easy to access the digital version of Paul Zanker’s The Mask fo Socrates . Zanker dates the earliest surviving depictions of a bearded Christ to AD 300 and in illustration no. 162 you can see a good example from that date . By the sixth century the bearded image has transferred to the east.e.g Zanker’s illustration no 166, St.Catherine’s ,Sinai,  and it would seem that the face of Christ on the Image of Edessa derives from this.There is no Zanker in his  Bibilography.I was also surprised that Guscin did not stress that tetradiplon only refers to the cloth when it did not yet have an image on it. There is no documentary evidence to show that it was folded with the image on it. Wilson has misled many here.As I have mentioned before, it seems strange that Guscin describes the Image as vanishing in 1204 when it was always in the un looted Pharos Chapel throughout the sack.I also think Guscin is being rather rigid in assuming that references to images of Chirst in Edessa always refer to what was taken to Contantinople in 944. Not only were images of Christ quite common from the fourth century but often there was a sequence of the same relic . This was inevitable when so many were lost or destroyed.  Replacements either carried on the sacredness of the one they replaced ( e.g. The Volto Santo in Lucca) or were said to be the old one lost but then miraculously found again ( e.g. The rediscovery of the lost body of St Mark in a column in St.Mark’s.)

There is no documentation that any of the many relics recorded in the Pharos Chapel had been moved from there before the Fourth Crusade.

I agree that two images, which, as I say in my article, could not be from the same body unless it had longer arms than any others known to anatomists,needs further research. (One of the consistent features of early depictions is a space between the elbows and body on the back image- lie down in this pose and your arms won’t meet in the front!) Double images are quite common in Byzantine art so that is one starting point. It is also a possibility that some of the so-called copies of the Shroud are not copies at all but independently made double images- these seem to come mainly from Spain- so research needs to concentrate there.Again and again I make the point that there are many areas of research on the Shroud that have not yet begun.

My book Holy Bones, Holy Dust, How Relics Shaped the History of Medieval Europe was published by Yale University Press in 2011, the paperback is due out next month. If you go the Yale University Press US website and access the book and then click on reviews you will see that it has been well received by the academic community (after all, it is published by a university press),including the Catholic press. In the medieval world the Turin Shroud was one of many  thousands of relics claiming to be from the first century -it did not stand out from the others and I did not discuss it. I knew a little of Ian Wilson and knew that among the historians I had read on relics he was never taken seriously. He could be ignored.However, I was then sent a copy of Thomas de Wesselow’s new book The Sign in the hope that I would review it. Dr. de Wesselow is billed as a brilliant Cambridge art historian and it appeared that he was a man of high academic credibility. He claimed that he had spent several years working on the Shroud. i disagreed, as everyone else had, with his thesis that the Shroud helped create the early Christian communities, but I was amazed to read that after all his years of study he agreed with Ian Wilson all the way through. So Ian Wilson who is not taken seriously by anyone in the academic world was being given an imprimatur by ‘a brilliant Cambridge art historian’. This is when I decided that I would set out the main objections to Wilson’s theories, which as Yannick Clement is pointing out again and again, collapse as soon as they are properly examined. I have since written a second article ‘The Tetradiplon Revisited’ in which I pay tribute to Yannick Clement and others on this very site for alerting me to the way that Wilson has misguided us about ‘tetradiplon’.Stephen Jones used a Wikipedia article about me which he claimed I had written myself. I had not, I knew nothing about it and it is very limited. I have written a short biography which is in the Authors’ section of Yale University Press LONDON ( e.g. not the US site).I am sorry that Stephen Jones has been so misleading about me. I accept his withdrawal of his comments that I am a ‘hired gun’ who would even write what I knew to be false in order to make money.This is a serious accusation when I have to try and sell books to university presses ( I am also published by Oxford University Press)!!  I hope he is more careful in writing his blog in the future. He can, of course, continue his long attack on my articles but,as one commentator has already said, his work on this is ’embarrassing’.

Thanks for an interesting posting. With the Shroud,of course, you have several hundred years during which the Images were subject to all kinds of treatment. I don’t think there is any evidence that, other than the bloodstains, the pigments penetrated below the surface as they should not,of course, if Ceninni’s instructions had been followed. My own feeling is that the presence over several hundred years, perhaps into the nineteenth century, of the painted surface images , may have left shadows below. It is a pity we do not have several hundred years to experiment.One of my illustrations in the lecture I have given is a panel from the Zittau Veil in which the figures ( originally painted on linen  cloth in 1472) are amazingly similar to those of the Shroud in their ghostlike appearance . I think my audience who had thought that the images on the Shroud were like no other were quite surprised to find that there were comparative samples although I need to find many more to consolidate the point. The Zittau pigments came off when the Veil was used as a steam bath cover by Russian soldiers in the Second World War. So perhaps you could try steaming your painted cloth. however, you still have the problem that the surface images have only been on a short time and it may be that the similarities between the Shroud and the Zittau Veil were because both had had the pigments covering the outside of the cloth for several hundred years and this left an impression that we can see when the pigments and gesso had disintegrated.However, I know of someone trying to recreate the Shroud as if it were a medieval painting but we still have the period of finding that five hundred years!And yes oil paints  were not used so you would have to mix up the pigments with tempera.There is no problem with the quality of painting on linen.

Sceptics would, I assume,  say that the image on the Shroud was actually derived from previous depictions of the bearded Christ rather than the other way around. I leave the question open for discussion.As I have made clear, the ingenuity of weavers from very early on was impressive- weaving is after all the main skill of daily life and aristocrats, then as now, wanted only the best. The same was true of the Middle Ages and Renaissance- you only have to look at the pictures of aristocratic sitters to see what amazing things weavers were capable of. Nothing particularly special about the Shroud here. ( I was only making this point because Wilson persists in saying that the Shroud was especially fine when it clearly is not in comparison to the finest linens of the first or second centuries.)The problem for earlier textiles is survival and if one is beginning from the first century then it is inevitable that one considers environments in which linen survives -this is how new avenues of research get started- they may lead nowhere ,of course, but if one ignores them completely then the subject stagnates. I am really amazed at how little new thinking seems to be emerging from the St. Louis conference- although I shall, like others, wait and see.Meanwhile I applaud Hugh for trying to get new thinking out there. Good  research starts with imagination. Suppose  the Shroud is authentic, then work through all the different environments and communities where it might have been preserved.

Those who are attached to the Vignon thesis would then be able to explain why the first representations of the bearded Christ come from Rome rather than the east.So yet another area for further research, especially among the art of the catacombs!However, personally. , I haven’t seen any evidence that upsets my default position that the Shroud is medieval- it is too easy to link an ‘icon’ to e Shroud without any other supporting evidence- as you will see from catacomb art ,there are no shortage of icons around and they can’t all be the Shroud!","date":"August 16, 2014 at 3:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/comment-promoted-looking-beyond-an-edessa-constantinople-route/","cat":"history","title":"Comment Promoted:  Looking Beyond an Edessa-Constantinople Route"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S.

Still the problem of damp but at least there would have been a community consistently giving them care. This is an alternative to Alexandria and Egypt where again there were strong early Christian communities ( going back to the first century as the surviving papyri of early Christian texts show) who would not have had to worry about the problem of damp!But all these are speculation, it is just that some are more probable than others  and I put the Edessa route as among the least probable.","date":"August 16, 2014 at 3:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/comment-promoted-looking-beyond-an-edessa-constantinople-route/","cat":"history","title":"Comment Promoted:  Looking Beyond an Edessa-Constantinople Route"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"In an age when provenance was vital for getting a relic accepted, it would be extraordinary if Lirey did not advertise where they had got their relic from when this would have given it enormous prestige and a chance to get it accepted as authentic.

So we can assume it remained there and its subsequent history needs to be charted from then on with this in mind.

Marrow dates the change to 1300- there is another possible example in the Church of San Domenico in Orvieto that another scholar has dated to 1290.

Look at the illustration of 372 flagellation marks, note that not a single one of them seems to break the skin. As evidence of an actual physical flagellation this could not be possible, a few of the blows must have broken the skin, especially when the flagrum was designed to torture rather than just be a rod for beating.As evidence of a painted surface, no problem the artist simply daubed on the marks, inspired probably by the Old Testament texts that suggested the three different types of instruments that Faccini was able to distinguish (see my article).Now you have a choice, the marks of a real flagellation or a painted flagellation. I just happen to think a real flagellation is so improbable on the evidence on the Shroud that I go for a flagellation that has been painted on.  When, as here, the flagellation covers the whole body back and front, I side with the art  historian and expert on Passion iconography James Marrow who says this is a development of the fourteenth century.I will happily consider any alternative ways of producing the scourge marks that are offered by the ‘experts’ on this blog.In so far as some of these postings appear on the web in a Google search, I have little alternative but to put my case as strongly as possible in the hope that, even if not for readers here, others will access the November issue of History Today, even if they only access the text version freely available which lacks the crucial illustrations of the print version ( that show how typical the flow of blood is of other fourteenth century depictions of the body of Christ).

What we do have is fifteenth and sixteenth century descriptions of the blood images that show that they were much more vivid than they are now, enough to really shock the observer.  We have a description of 1449 by a Benedictine monk to say that they were painted. I quote them in my article for those (?Thomas) who would like to know what they say.The shock effect of the blood images  is typical of the blood cults of the fourteenth century. What is really important is to compare the patterns of blood flow on the Shroud( see the Shroudscope depictions) with those,say, on the Holkham Bible of 1330 and you will see that they are virtually identical. The illustrations in the print version of the History Today article make the point perfectly. You will also find other similar blood flows in the Roettgen Pieta and Man of Sorrows depictions of the fourteenth century. The Shroud is spot on ,so much so, that i wonder whether there was not some kind of template the artist worked from.The Tempesta engraving (1613) shows that the Crown of Thorns was on the Shroud, now vanished but as the Crown is also mentioned in independent fifteenth century descriptions of the Shroud  we have confirmation that it was originally on the Shroud, and this again is typical of the fourteenth century where they show the Crown in place AFTER Christ has been taken down from the Cross.. So read the descriptions in my article and explain what you think accounts for the very vivid ‘bloodstains’.  The number one explanation I have been given so far is paint, probably, if the vividness of the colour is taken into account, vermilion, but perhaps you have an alternative explanation, Colin?What remains on the Shroud today after so many centuries of expositions is anybody’s guess. There is circumstantial evidence that with the images being on the outer fibrils only and calcium carbonate  being found by STURP in ‘large’ quantities that this is the remnant of the gesso painted just as the medieval manuals such as the one by Cennino Cennini, advise. A professor of physiology who has read the STURP reports on the ‘blood’ has told me that what STURP thought were bloodstains are more likely  animal collagen, used to cement the calcium as a selant. But we will need an expert microscopic examination to see what the accidents of time have left of the original surface. I am not qualified to assess what McCrone found and other than quoting it in my article I leave it at that. My argument does not depend on what may or may not be left on the Shroud, it would be a matter of chance what has survived, but I shall certainly be interested in more up-to-date testing is ever done.","date":"November 3, 2014 at 6:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/01/history-vs-science-the-freeman-beat-goes-on/","cat":"history","title":"History vs. Science:  The Freeman Beat Goes On"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Thanks, Colin, I look forward to hearing of the scientists who support your interpretation. I assume we are agreed that this is a fourteenth century creation of some sort. That is a good starting point. What we have to establish,is,  however the images were created in the first place, how the artist or creator managed to match the iconography of the fourteenth century, blood flows, all -over scourging, Crown of Thorns left in place, so  completely. If we have the Holkham Bible, there to see online and in the British Library, we have what is almost a  a template of the flagellation and blood flows seen on the Shroud. Would you suggest that the creator of the Shroud used a similar depiction as an inspiration?But what I don’t understand is why, when painting on linen was very common – thousands of examples are recorded in monastic and church inventories, why your ‘artist’ would need to resort to such an arcane procedure as you suggest. Surely he would have stayed with the recommended procedure, apply gesso to the outer fibrils of the cloth and paint on top that may well have become detached from the Shroud as time passed.You will see from my article two examples of faded linens very similar to the Shroud although we would have to look more closely at them to make sure. As you will see I have put out the call for conservationists who work with medieval linens to see if we can dig up some more comparative examples. The trouble is that most faded linens are not put on display  and the only reason why I know about the two I mention is that parts of the original images remain intact.","date":"November 3, 2014 at 8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/01/history-vs-science-the-freeman-beat-goes-on/","cat":"history","title":"History vs. Science:  The Freeman Beat Goes On"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Louis – who don’t you read my article-it is all there!

This is the way by putting together the independent descriptions that agree with each other ( and ,of course, there are many other depictions with the Crown in place on the head) that we can slowly build a reconstruction of how the images on the Shroud looked originally.The key point ,of course, is that depictions of the crown left on after Christ was taken down from the Cross only appear in the fourteenth century possibly earlier but only rarely.So how was the Crown of thorns put onto the Shroud? Embroidered on? I think painted on is much more likely as painting on linen was very common.

Most of these stories are, of course, apocryphal but still very powerful e.g one that the evangelist Mark slept on an island in the lagoon at Venice. St. Oronzo of Lecce was supposed to have met the messenger bearing Paul’s letter to the Romans, who landed on the coast near Lecce, been so convinced by it that he sought out Paul and was converted by him and so became the first bishop of Lecce where he is still honoured by a statue in the main square. The Abgar legend would seem to be one of these.Treat these legends with care- after the fourth century there was intense competition among Christian communities to prove that they were there first!

Excuse my not answering in Spanish- my daughter is the Spanish speaker in the family not me!Most relics purporting to come from the first century, from the life and Passion of Christ, the Virgin Mary, the apostles and Mary Magdalene are represented by multiple, competing copies, e.g. many pieces of the True Cross, lots of girdles worn by the Virgin Mary, several heads of John the Baptist,two bodies of Mary Magdalene,  many phials of Christ’s blood, a number of burial shrouds, a number of images of the living Christ ( e.g. the Image of Edessa). In many cases the descriptions are not precise enough to know what they consisted of and hundreds of thousands of relics were destroyed in the Reformation by Protestant Christians. We are lucky to have copies of the Image of Edessa ( almost certainly created in the sixth century- see Hans Belting on this) that show clearly that it was an isolated head of a living Christ to which a legendary account of its origins in the first century was added.All one can say in the case of the Turin Shroud is that there is no mention of a shroud that seems to be it before the fourteenth century. There are many references to other burial shrouds of Christ, of course,although none, except the one at Cahouin , which had a large following, seems to have gripped the imagination in the way that,say, the Veil of Veronica or the body of James at Compostela did. It was just one of the many thousands of specific relics that did not attract a following, except marginally in the sixteenth century, and certainly, in the hierarchy of relics, the Turin Shroud could not compete with the Cross, Crown of Thorns or blood taken from Jesus on the Cross.Wilson makes the very fundamental mistake of assuming that any image or icon mentioned is the Turin Shroud. He writes as if no other images or icons existed and that burial shrouds were given a high status within the hierarchy of relics there is no evidence that they were.This distorts his narrative but, as others have pointed out, he even distorts the material he does use in order to make his very weak case.But how often does one have to go on repeating this – we have Yannick Clement, who believes in the authenticity of the Shroud, myself ,a more general historian who has written the only full length history of medieval relics on the market, and Byzantine specialists such as Davor all saying the same thing – the same thing that has been put forward by professional historians for many years now without anyone from the academic community coming up in Wilson’s support.Scientific work on the Shroud suffered from earlier examinations by STURP in 1978 being undertaken  without any preliminary assessment of the Shroud by textile experts before it was examined by a group of self-appointed  scientists none of whom had any experience with ancient textiles, outside a conservation laboratory and with samples removed at will and then scattered around the place, ( I am told that the guardians of the samples only give them out to those who already support the authenticity of the Shroud, but i don’t know if this is true or not- others may be able to help here.) No wonder there are endless inconclusive discussions about how the image was formed, everyone is arguing from a botched job.","date":"September 5, 2012 at 6:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/03/part-7-of-the-jones-freeman-brouhaha-about-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Part 7 of the Jones & Freeman Brouhaha about Ian Wilson"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"So long as Ron’s comments make people actually read my articles ‘Charles Freeman Shroud of Turin and the Image of Edessa- A Misguided Journey ‘ and ‘Tetradiplon Revisited’, I have no problems.Incidentally the fuzzy photo is only because that was the best my Iphone could do when i came, completely unexpectedly, on a representation of the Mandylion- no attempt here to deceive anyone!What is Andy on about ‘the bishop’ ?

There is no payment asked or received for my articles. I do not know my arguments to be false (as I have said they are not much different from those of Yannick Clement and other scholars who have dealt with Wilson’s work) and if he had made any attempt to research me he would have seen that my last two books have been published by Yale University Press and cover both the early history of Christianity and the history of relics.

B. As I posted this as no 62 out of 100 comments as a direct reply to ArtSciences earlier comment and it risks getting lost, I am reproducing it at the end as well. I would add that anyone who insists that tetradiplon applies to a burial cloth after an image was placed on it must provide documentary evidence that contradicts the plain words of the Acts of Thaddeus.ArtScience ‘I find it strange that Charles seems to say the tetradiplon description is rubbish much like the confused hearsay sequence of how the image got on there.’No Art Science, i have never said that ‘tetradiplon’ was rubbish. It is a strange word and it needs an explanation as to why the author of the legendary Acts of Thaddeus used it.First one must clear the decks.1) Tetradiplon is ONLY used of the cloth when it was handed to Jesus.2) Wilson is misleading in The Shroud (2010), p. 190, when he suggests that the word tetradiplon is used to describe the cloth AFTER Jesus had wiped his face on it. Whatever the reason or motives for his ‘mistake’, Wilson has confused many people on this.3) The Acts of Thaddeus, if read in full, make it quite clear that the author distinguishes between the cloth on which Jesus wiped his face ( the tetradiplon cloth, if you like) and the burial cloths of Jesus that are described separately as being in the tomb AFTER the face cloth had already arrived in Edessa.THIS MAKES ALL THE DEBATES OVER HOW THE TURIN SHROUD MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLDED REDUNDANT. It had to be folded somehow to preserve it when not on display and it could have been folded in all different kinds of ways over the centuries of its life, probably different ways at different times. What seem to be happening here is people seeing folds that fit in with a tetradiplon folding when the word tetradiplon was never applied to the burial cloths in the tombSo we come back to why the word tetradiplon was used of the cloth when it was handed to Jesus. One guess, that I explore in my Tetradiplon Revisited ( which comes up as about number six if you put in the word ‘tetradiplon’ into Google), is that the author wanted to give a special status to the cloth that Jesus chose to wipe his face on. We know from festivals such as the Athenian Panathenaia that a peplos was specially woven, then folded (see the illustration in my article) and then handed over to be placed on the statue of Athena. There is some evidence that in Christian times a similar ritual was carried out for the pallium given to bishops.It was originally handed over as a folded piece of cloth but, eventually instead of a folded rectangle, the bishop was given a simple strip, So it is not impossible that a similar ritual was in the mind of the author of the Acts of Thaddeus. He simply wanted to embellish the legend a bit and he may have been aware of ceremonies in which folded cloths were handed over BEFORE they were used in a ceremony. I leave this suggestion open but it is a line of enquiry that better fits the existing evidence than anything that looks at folded burial cloths","date":"September 21, 2012 at 4:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Max. I agree with Beltung that the Image of Edessa was one of many similar images appearing in the late sixth century that then had legendary accounts attached to them to give them credibility as relics. In this the Edessa legend would be similar to hundreds of similar legends in the later Middle Ages that became attached to relics that could not possibly be what the legends said they were.The only reason for bringing Wilson into the debate as he seems to have given the impression to many people that the Acts of Thaddeus uses the words tetradiplon to describe the cloth after the image was on it and he omits the reference to the burial cloths as cloths which are different from the cloth that was folded tetradiplon before it was handed to Jesus. So any account of the folding that ignores this is bound to be challenged. Do you accept that Wilson has been misleading , deliberately or not, on this issue? If you do then I am happy to stop mentioning him by name. If people go on discussing tetradiplon as if Wilson is right then it is a different matter although I have said all I need to say here.If you have evidence that a burial shroud was described as tetradiplon I am sure we would be happy to hear it and why not as much philological, iconographic, literary and archaeological evidence as you will on the Image of Edessa but your conclusions do seem much more convoluted than they need be .","date":"September 21, 2012 at 7:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Max.

Now find the relief and look carefully at the cloth. There is a final double folding being put in place in place, so is this the fourth folding of a cloth that has already been folded three times? Hard to say but I think I can pick out five different layers in one of the halves being folded. The fact that the sculptor has depicted more than four on a cloth that has been folded doubled each time  suggests that this MIGHT be a depiction of a tetradiplon cloth. If so the folding BEFORE it is placed on the statue of Athena, fits well with the use of a tetradiplon cloth being presented to Jesus BEFORE he wiped his face with it in the Acts of Thaddeus.As those who have read the article will know, I suggest that the presentation of a pallium might have followed a similar ritual in the Christian era.Interestingly one, late , description of the Image of Edessa also describes it as a peplos.Need we look further?","date":"September 22, 2012 at 6:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Max.

One possible reason is to give the cloth status (as in calling it ‘sindon’ or ‘fine linen’) in what is a legendary, not historical, account in any case. See my article Tetradiplon Revisited for examples of this.This is highly speculative but not impossible.2) Why Wilson wrote (The Shroud(2010), p.190) ‘Although its [the Acts of Thaddeus] initially off-putting aspect is that it ‘explains’  the creation of the Image as by Jesus washing himself, it intriguingly GOES ON [my emphasis] to describe the cloth on which the Image was imprinted as tetradiplon’, when, in fact, the word tetradiplon was used only BEFORE Jesus wiped his face. Was Wilson being misleading or careless in giving the impression that the cloth was tetradiplon AFTER Jesus had wiped his face on it?3) Why this same Acts of Thaddeus goes on to give a separate reference to burial cloths in the tomb, something that Wilson omits to tell us- perhaps he never read that far.Anyone who analyses tetradiplon only through Wilson’s account and without reading the original Acts of Thaddeus is likely to be misled, as I was in the first instance.

It is a strange word and it needs an explanation as to why the author of the legendary Acts of Thaddeus used it. First one must clear the decks.1) Tetradiplon is ONLY used of the cloth when it was handed to Jesus.2) Wilson is misleading in The Shroud (2010), p. 190, when he suggests that the word tetradiplon is used to describe the cloth AFTER Jesus had wiped his face on it. Whatever the reason or motives for his ‘mistake’, Wilson has confused many people on this. 3) The Acts of Thaddeus, if read in full, make it quite clear that the author distinguishes between the cloth on which Jesus wiped his face ( the tetradiplon cloth, if you like) and the burial cloths of Jesus that are described separately as being in the tomb AFTER the face cloth had already arrived in Edessa.THIS MAKES ALL THE DEBATES OVER HOW THE TURIN SHROUD MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOLDED REDUNDANT. It had to be folded somehow to preserve it when not on display and it could have been folded in all different kinds of ways over the centuries of its life, probably different ways at different times. What seem to be happening here is people seeing folds that fit in with a tetradiplon folding when the word tetradiplon was never applied to the burial cloths in the tombSo we come back to why the word tetradiplon was used of the cloth when it was handed to Jesus. One guess, that I explore in my Tetradiplon Revisited ( which comes up as about number six if you put in the word ‘tetradiplon’ into Google),  is that the author wanted to give a special status to the cloth that Jesus chose to wipe his face on. We know from festivals such as the Athenian Panathenaia  that a peplos was specially woven, then folded (see the illustration in my article) and then handed over to be placed on the statue of Athena. There is some evidence that in Christian times a similar ritual was carried out for the pallium given to bishops.It was originally handed over as a folded piece of cloth but, eventually instead of a folded rectangle, the bishop was given a simple strip, So it is not impossible that a similar ritual was in the mind of the author of the Acts of Thaddeus. He simply wanted to embellish the legend a bit and he may have been aware of ceremonies in which folded cloths were handed over BEFORE they were used in a ceremony. I leave this suggestion open but it is a line of enquiry that better fits the existing evidence than anything that looks at folded burial cloths.","date":"September 21, 2012 at 4:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"From the Acts of Thaddeus. ‘And He knew as knowing the heart, and asked to wash Himself; and a towel [tetradiplon] was given Him; and when He had washed Himself, He wiped His face with it.

Hugh is right that originally the ell was similar to a cubit but gradually the length seems to have doubled so Hugh’s 8 times 2 is my  nearly four by one.The width of cloth was determined by the treadle loom that comes in about 1000 AD and is so much more efficient (you can use your feet as well as your hands)that it spread fast. The problem was that  one could seldom weave more widely than 1.20 or 1.30m with one weaver, unlike the broader cloths of antiquity -often over two metres wide because two weavers worked the shuttles. So I assume that the longer ell developed as a typical measurement of the width of cloth from a treadle loom. Length was not such a problem because roller bars allowed finished cloth to be accumulated and cloth lengths of up to 25 or 30 metres are known.

I am now quite used to following up a source quoted in Wilson and finding something very different from what he suggests (the classic remains the discrepancy between Wilson’s depiction of della Rovere’s actual portrayal of Christ in the Shroud and his own version, p. 28 of my 2010 edition of Wilson’s The Shroud in which Wilson even reverses the position of the arms!).So while I was having a research day in the Cambridge University Library, I called in the Masada Report to check out the source references given above. In my edition of Wilson the discussion is on p. 109-110. P. 169, fig. sixteen does exist. It does show a selvedge on a goathair cloth. The excavators appear to have illustrated it  because it is woven on a tubular or two beamed loom. No other example of the use of this kind of loom or selvedge has been found this early in the Mediterranean . However, earlier examples are known in northern Europe from earlier so the suggestion is that either the cloth originated in northern Europe –more likely – see further below- – or is evidence for the first use of this kind of selvedge in the Mediterranean.  Wilson then gives a reference to Gabriel Vial’s 1989 report on the Shroud in which Vial talks of the construction of the Shroud’s selvedge as  ’tout a fait inhabituelle’.  He does not give the page number in my edition of The Shroud,  but it is p. 15 with an illustration on p.16 of the Shroud’s selvedge. (The article is in the CIETA Bulletin for 1989, Dave B quotes a reference for pages 27-9 from his edition of Wilson but this is a completely different article!) The problem is that the selvedge on the Shroud does not appear the same as the selvedge shown in the Masada report. So all we can do is agree with Vial –the article is his own report of his examination of the Shroud while they were choosing the sample for radiocarbon dating on 21st April, 1988, so is interesting and perhaps even important in its own right- that the selvedge on the Shroud is ‘very unusual’.We next go on to the reference to figs. 111-113 on pages 201-11 of the Masada report. Yes these figs. do exist and on these pages. They all refer to the same fragment of wool. It is picked out and illustrated as it is wool, 2:2, Z twist spin, balanced diamond twill. So except for the Z spin being similar to that of the Shroud , I can’t see why this is relevant- it is not herringbone, linen or 3:1. In the discussion on the origins of the textiles found at Masada (p. 239), this cloth is placed in their group iv. The excavators’ conclusion is that these textiles probably came from northern Europe as this kind of twist (Z) and this kind of pattern is known from examples there. They suggest it may have come in with Roman soldiers who were involved in the crushing of the Masada revolt. I simply cannot see why Wilson provides a reference to a piece of cloth that has absolutely nothing in common with the Shroud except that its thread is Z spun (and thus as the excavators suggest probably spun in northern Europe).So far nothing about stitching at all so I had to find my own reference to the stitching in the Masada report and it is found on pp 170-1 where they discuss the 45 textiles that have stitching on them. They illustrate six of these stitches on figs. 20-25 but they do not describe any of them as exceptional. So I was surprised to find that Wilson reproduces Masada fig. 23 (as his fig. 8)- which is a counter-hemming stitch- as one which the excavators ‘adjudged to be a very unusual seam’. I can’t find any reference to such a judgement but as Wilson has provided no references it may have been somewhere outside the accompanying text in this section.Luckily I had access to a higher authority- my wife who designed and sewed theatre costumes for her degree and then went on to work in the textiles department of the Victoria and Albert Museum. She took one look at Wilson’s ‘unusual seam’ and said in fact that this was the standard stitch for joining two pieces of cloth together when one wanted to make sure the ends did not fray. Nothing unusual about it at all!Wilson does mention that Mechthild Flury-Lemberg is on record as saying that this stitch is similar to the one on the Shroud but he gives no reference for her opinion. In fact, it would seem that the stitch on the Shroud is the basic standard one  which one would use then and now to join two pieces of cloth.And so how much more time does one waste with Wilson? I have certainly better things to do but at least I can warn Shroud researchers to take anything that Wilson says with a large pinch of salt. I had only to read into the next page to find other issues that I could have dealt with in the same way as here but life is too short and I have far more interesting and accurate historians to work with. Hugh seems the man for the job of taking a critique of Wilson further – sorry Hugh but so long as people are going on quoting Wilson in their support it needs to be done.","date":"November 28, 2013 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘A certain trustworthy believing Jew, immediately after the Resurrection of the Lord, stole from His Sepulchre the sacred linen cloth and hid it in his house for many days; but, by the favour of the Lord Himself, it was found after the lapse of many years, and was brought to the notice of the whole people about three years(32) before [this statement was made to Arculf].’O.K.

And if the Assyrian cubit was used by traders in cloth,then the Shroud could have been woven anywhere  so again that provides no evidence of an original link to Palestine.So if the Assyrian cubit was really the measure, which I doubt, it simply says that the Shroud might have been made somewhere along the trading routes of the Middle East at some point within a margin of several hundred years.

This cubit of commerce was carried with the lingua communis, the language of trade and diplomacy that stretched from the Euphrates to theMediterranean, the tongue that had become the common language of the Jew. Aramaic: the same language which Jesus spoke. Aramaic had been the communication medium of the Assyrian Empire and Israel had been a subject of Assyria.’ But O.K. this article, that I HAD read, just says what I said : that the cubit had been ‘an international standard of that time for merchants of the Near East, and had been so for centuries.’ ‘This cubit of commerce was carried with the lingua communis, the language of trade and diplomacy that stretched from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean’. Greek (koine),the language of Paul was actually the main trading language by this period, four hundred years after Alexander had spread Greek influence over the Near and Middle East.So if a piece of cloth is found to have been woven in Assyrian cubits -it could have been woven anywhere in these centuries and along these far flung routes. Just because the Temple authorities may have used Assyrian cubits ( this is not proven by anything in the article- I don’t know which of the many alternative cubits the priests used but probably one can find out) does not mean that the Shroud was made there because Jerusalem was only one of thousands of possible trading centres in the bustling first century Mediterranean.Again, the fact that the Shroud may or may not have been deliberately woven in Assyrian cubits does not take us anywhere. Can you provide anything from the Assyrian cubit measurement that provides a link to Jerusalem rather than any of these other trading centres or specifically to the first century?In fact, this is probably the most unhelpful cubit there is to be woven in. If it measured in Roman cubits  it would be datable to a much narrower range.So what one ought to be saying is: ‘Unfortunately the Shroud is woven in Assyrian cubits and as these were used for so many centuries and across such a wide region, this gives us no help at all in placing the Shroud in either date or place of manufacture.’","date":"November 18, 2013 at 2:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/the-shroud-is-8-x-2-assyrian-whatchamacallits/","cat":"history","title":"The Shroud is 8 x 2 Assyrian Whatchamacallits"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Paulette.

The excavators report suggest that this was because flax was not grown in Judaea in the first century, but rather in Galilee and wool would have been the normal local fabric for clothes which the majority of the Masada textiles were. Later,the second century AD onwards,  apparently because the Romans provided better irrigation, Palestine became well known for its fine flax. I think it is wrong to get woollen clothes and linen cloths, including those made for burials, mixed up as if the weaving of one could be compared to the weaving of another. As the insistence on fine linen for the priests shows, different fabrics were used in different  contexts and different styles and patterns followed. As I remember it the Masada stitching was largely for repairs of worn clothing so I was surprised to hear that it was something special -one reason for my original question.

No one doubts that ancient weaving could be highly sophisticated- look at the Rameses girdle of 1200 BC in Liverpool Museum- it has been almost impossible to recreate the weave today even with programming the weave into a computer. Again look at the third and fourth century AD damask silks, of which only a few fragments survive. They needed up to twenty heddle rods on the loom to achieve them. The Shroud is way way below this sophistication, of course. But what Fulbright does not show is that there is a single example of a linen herringbone 3/1 weave known. This does not mean that they did not exist because so little survives (outside Egyptian sources) that we cannot be sure but if the Shroud is first century it is the only one with this combination of linen, herringbone, 3/1.

There is now the blood evidence- if the blood on the Shroud is AB ,then this blood type only originated a thousand years ago. So I am keeping to a medieval date for the Shroud until someone comes up with something better – which may or may not happen. One day we may understand how the image was made- science is always making progress about such things.2) The copy. I only said that this was a SUGGESTION that had been put forward. As I have not read the original article in which this suggestion was put forward i cannot say more. So it is not ‘my ‘ claim that it is a copy.3) You are right about historical speculation. The attempts to find a route to take the Shroud back from the fourteenth century to the first century AD are enormously speculative and I think Yannick here has shown up  some of the problems. If you read de Wesselow, he is full of bizarre suggestions , see my original review on Amazon about just ONE link in the chain , back to Constantinople.The real problem about doing scientific research on the Shroud is that the Vatican should have put it in a conservation department where trained conservationists could have worked on it in laboratory conditions and kept any pigments selected on site. Allowing a team from the States free access in the 1970s meant that even the original pigments were taken off the cloth and distributed all over and then many were examined in home laboratories. As a means of doing scientific work this was disastrous, it is not clear how many of those working on the pigments they took were qualified in either conservation or analysis. No wonder much of the work done on the Shroud never passed peer review. if it had been done in a single top laboratory, such as in the UK the Victoria and Albert Museum or the British Museum (but many excellent ones also in Italy) , there would not have been the problem.","date":"April 22, 2012 at 4:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I agree nothing is simple,especially as there was no precise way to describe particular relics and too many duplicates! – as John Calvin says.

Yes, it was in perfect condition because linen is preserved in Egypt, if not in many other places.  But Edessa is very damp! Can you please tell me how many pieces there are, from OUTSIDE Egypt, of linen carbon-14 dated to the period 300 BC to 300 AD?Today Protestants don’t revere relics. At the Reformation they actually burned them up. So too in early Christianity, relics were not revered. The documentary evidence for relics first becoming seen as important dates from the 380s, 350 years after the Crucifixion.  We do have good records of many images ‘not made from human hands’ appearing in the sixth century onwards. Linking any one of these to a later medieval relic is extraordinarily difficult because the terminology is never precise and the number of people who have the necessary experience in Byzantine Greek is, of course, very limited. I have never come across any trained Byzantine scholar who would support Wilson’s thesis,In my researches for Holy Bones, I found examples of the bodies of martyrs being preserved and honoured but never anything from the first century.  I am particularly interested in information about relics from before 550 because this is a long period, no less than 500 years, and  one has to find specific documentary evidence where a relic was, why before 380, it may have been venerated , against the trend. .  de Wesselow in his book The Sign refusers even to discuss the question.There was another trend, not to show any images that showed the suffering of Christ – you can’t find any such in early Christian art . It would have extraordinary for a Jew to have kept a blood-stained burial cloth as it would have gone against every traditional taboo. I doubt whether Wilson has found the evidence that no one else has for this period before 550. Hans Belting covers the issue well.Hans Belting,  Likeness and Presence, p. 213.‘Although an alleged letter of Christ that had healed the king [Agbar] was venerated as a relic, no image was mentioned [in Edessa] before the sixth century, when miraculous images became popular elsewhere as well. [CF –it is often forgotten that there were lots of them around!]  As late as 544, Procopius still attributed the recovery of the town from the Persians to the letter, whereas by 593, the chronicler Evagrius gave the credit to the ‘God-made image, which had not been touched by human hands.’Belting expresses the common opinion of scholars that there is no mention of an image in Edessa before c.600. You can choose not to believe the report that it was the custom to sprinkle the (open) eyes of the Mandlion with water but then you runn the risk of being accused of only accepting the documents that support you and rejecting those that don’t!

Was it, however, a ‘team’ , see below.‘Home laboratories’  I was only using Ray Roger’s own words. It is often very difficult to know with STURP researchers where their researches took place, whether in the public laboratories of which they were members or elsewhere. McCrone, of course, had his own business. I looked up Joseph Marino and, please correct me here, did find a long and interesting testimony of how God had brought him to the study of the Turin Shroud but no evidence that he done any laboratory work on the Shroud itself.‘Even the original pigments were taken off the cloth’, Pigments were on the Shroud, of course, no one denies that. I should have said ‘original pigments and other substances’. Even if you drum out McCrone  you have to accept that he found some pigments, Ray Rogers relies heavily on the pigment vermilion for his attempted refutation of the Carbon-14, and haemoglobin is a pigment of blood- all on the Shroud.The problem is as follows. You have an ancient piece of linen, date unknown with an image the nature of which is unknown.  Naturally people are interested in it including a number of individuals from the United States. Looking at where the 1978 STURP members came from, I don’t see any working in laboratories that specialized in ancient cloth. Had a single member of the 1978 team specific expertise in ancient textiles, had any even seen one before they saw the Shroud of Turin in 1978?  I am happy to be given the evidence if you have it.Then there is the rush of events due to the short timescale given to the team for examination. They are not working ,of course, in laboratory conditions and photos show a mass of  individuals crowded around the Shroud. But the sellotape is applied, the Shroud is unstitched.  Who knows what damage may have been done? This is not normally the way professional examinations of ancient paintings is done- it often takes years- there are cases in the British Museum at the moment when the full report is not expected for years!So the team make off back home after five days of frenzied work. Well, they have their 32 samples from all over the cloth, so what next? There is no evidence that they then teamed up with a museum conservation laboratory with experience in dealing with such material although there must have several in the US with the expertise to help them (again I am open to correction here). They seem to have kept the material among themselves. Then one of their members, Walter McCrone who has his own laboratory, is allowed to have access to all the 32 samples and comes up with a report that the samples are largely pigment. Consternation and eventually McCrone is forced out. This shows the weakness of the whole STURP approach of sending out the samples  to members of the team instead of people with specific expertise, this kind of result is bound to happen. I don’t know whether McCrone was right, broadly right but exaggerated the extent of the pigment, or totally wrong but the STURP procedures were bound to lead to fiascos such as these.A major part of the problem is that STURP increasingly became associated with the view that the Shroud was genuinely the first century burial cloth of Jesus and so its scientific credibility went down (whether it was/is right is not the question, it is the impression it gives of having decided the matter beyond all doubt, which is the antithesis of true scientific work. Compare the attitude of the Oxford radio-carbon-14 laboratory which says it will re-examine its 1988 results if evidence comes up to challenge them). When the  idea of professional carbon-14 dating came up, the Vatican started afresh by calling in people with the right professional experience in radio carbon-14 dating and textiles. This is ,of course, what they should have done all along. They should have handed over the Shroud in 1978 to a professional laboratory whose members had specific expertise in dealing with ancient textiles. I am sure that such a laboratory would have refused to allow any material from the Shroud out of their sight – there would have been none of this passing around of bits and pieces as seen in the Ray Rogers case below. Then outsiders who had particular expertise could have been asked in to see or work on the Shroud under proper laboratory conditions. Surely you have to admit that this would have been a better way of proceeding than the rushed 1978 examination.Compare these two accounts.1) From the Nature Report, February 1989 – a report signed by 21 individuals including six who were recorded as being at the selection.‘The sampling of the shroud took place in the Sacristy at Turin Cathedral on the morning of 21 April 1988.  Among those present when the sample as cut from the shroud were Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero (Archbishop of Turin), Professor L. Gonella (Department of Physics, Turin Polytechnic and the Archbishop’s scientific adviser), two textile experts (Professor F. Testore of Department of Materials Science, Turin Polytechnic and G. Vial of Musée des Tissues and Centre International d’Étude des Textiles Anciens in Lyon), Dr M. S. Tite of the British Museum, representatives of the three radiocarbon-dating laboratories (Professor P. E. Damon, Professor D. J. Donahue, Professor E. T. Hall, Dr R. E. M. Hedges and Professor W. Woelfli) and G. Riggi, who removed the sample from the shroud.The strip came from a single site on the main body of the shroud away from any patches or charred areas.  Three samples, each ~50 mg in weight, were prepared from this strip….. All these operations, except for the wrapping of the samples in foil and their placing in containers, were fully documented by video film and photography.’In view of the numbers present and their professional qualifications in textiles and radio-carbon dating, this selection would seem to be a valid process. Note that Luigi Gonella was present but there is no record that he was involved in cutting the Shroud. 2) And this from Raymond Rogers’ report in Thermochimica Acta (2005).  I have no evidence that Raymond Rogers had any particular expertise in radio-carbon-14 procedures.‘On 12 December 2003, I received samples of both warp and weft threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella had taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. Gonella reported that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.’Note that the date he received these samples, the removal of which is not recorded in the original selection process, is over fifteen years later. When did Gonella take them from the sample? Did anyone see him doing so?  Where had the fibres been since then, held under what conditions?So let’s not cast aspersion on anyone, let’s just say that the procedures by which the fibres arrived at the radio-carbon laboratories and Raymond Rogers’ laboratory fifteen years later were significantly different! The qualifications of each to assess radio-carbon-14 dating are also very different. Roger’s vague assertions about his fibres do not, of course, and he never claimed they did, provide an alternative date, nor do they provide any reason why a test on another part of the cloth should produce anything earlier than the medieval period. There is no reason to privilege Ray Rogers’ report above that of the Nature report although this is frequently done.I keep to the presumption that the ‘official’ radio-carbon14  report must take precedence until an equivalent  means of dating comes up with something different , possibly 6th-7th century when these images were first reported ( N.B. carbon-14 dating of Oviedo shroud at 7th century) or earlier.I think I have made my points clearly enough to withdraw here. Wearing my historian’s hat, the evidence that the Turin Shroud can be taken back the Edessa route seems non-existent. I haven’t seen any acknowledged Byzantine scholar (and it is a pretty specialized world needing years of study of ancient texts) who would support it.","date":"April 23, 2012 at 3:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I had planned to opt out of this discussion but looked up a library copy of Wilson’s latest (2011) Shroud and his account of the birth of the Edessa image is complete and utter nonsense. On p. 162, he quotes from the Doctrine of Addai, which is a later fourth/ early fifth century legendary account which includes STORIES about King Agbar. Wilson’s quote comes from an account of Addai coming before King Agbar and his face shining , although no one else other than Agbar can see this. A page later Wilson says that this is the Turin Shroud aka the Edessa image. Well ,why should this legend of Addai’s actual living face have anything to do with any shroud image of Christ – why should it relate to any cloth/painted image at all?. There is absolutely no hint that this is about an image at all- its one of the miracles of Addai, of which there are many others.I think we should stick with serious scholarship and just acknowledge that there is nothing that can be seen as an image  in Edessa until the late sixth century when in other regions,  several of these images are recorded for the first time.The image is, how often does one have to repeat this, always said to be Christ while alive and this is why copies of the Mandylion always show Christ with his eyes open without any marks of suffering. As Belting says, this was a time when there was some conflict over whether there should be images of Christ and the invention of a legend (one version of the Edessa origin) that Christ had sent an image of himself was used by those who argued that he could be shown.I had not expected Wilson to lay himself open quite so easily to derision but, as we have seen, there are people who do continue to believe him. I wonder, how many support his ingenious idea that the Carbon-14 dating was contaminated because that is where hands held up the Shroud. But how often was it exposed, how was it held up so that the whole image could be seen , do we know that the hands were consistently in the same place, is there any sign of wear and tear that one would expect from continual handling, was there really enough sweat to contaminate it (without causing decay) and how did this come to the amount to make a first century piece of linen come exactly to the radio-carbon -14 date 1260-1390.

If you get the 2011 edition look at page 240. Here he quotes a source, I think from 1090, which says that the Mandylion was kept locked up and that only the emperor could see it.  It was ,of course, in the Pharos Chapel, the private chapel of the emperors . So unless the emperors reversed their decision about this, it was not on view to ordinary mortals . This just confirms that it is unlikely to be the ‘sheets’ in the Pharos chapel, which are listed separately in 1201 anyway , and certainly not the same as the exposed shroud with an image in the Blachernae chapel at the other end of town. Most commentators who want to take the Turin Shroud back beyond the Middle Ages, say that the only shroud that corresponds to the Turin Shroud is the Blachernae one. Wilson goes against this ,of course- he sticks with the locked up Mandylion.But I had limited time and did not read further to see how he resolved the question. The problem remains ,of course, that we know that the relics in the Pharos chapel were not touched in 1204 and that many of them went on in the years afterwards to Louis IX’s Sainte-Chapelle, where the Crown of Thorns that he got from the Pharos Chapel ( via some Venetian bankers!) was the star attraction. There is some evidence that the Blachernae shroud may have gone into Europe via Athens. So perhaps the real question should be, forget about the Edessa image, and try and trace the Blachernae Shroud back. We know that many of the relics in this chapel were placed there in the first half of the FIFTH century by Pulcheria , the sister of the emperor Theodosius II ( ruled 408-450). So this might get the Blachernae Shroud back this early, 150 years earlier than the first mention of the Edessa image. it seems a much more likely route than Edessa. The Blachernae Shroud was said  to be a burial shroud of Jesus, there is no evidence that the Edessa Shroud EVER was, whatever Wilson might say.So Shroud sceptic though I am, I am putting forward a far more plausible ‘history’ of the Turin Shroud than Wilson is!","date":"April 24, 2012 at 10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Ron. The provenance of the sample is well known and recorded on film, unless you subscribe to the conspiracy theory of Tite and the Cardinal later swapping a sample over. I don’t as it is seems simply ludicrous. I was surprised that de Wesselow appeared to entertain it. The sample has a far better provenance than the fibres obtained by Rogers for instance which cannot ,in any way, meet scientific criteria- we don’t even know how they were stored or transported to Rogers or whether they were what they purported to be.I accept the 1988  finding until a clear alternative is put forward as to why the testing was not accurate. For this there must be a consensus.  We do not have any agreement over whether the problem is contaminants or reweaving.  You cannot convince a old sceptic like myself so long as those challenging the Carbon-14 cannot even agree among themselves what went wrong with the work of three professional laboratories. It is not good enough to put forward a series of vague possibilities as to why the testing might not be accurate.  So I stick to my original position that for me the presumption  is that the testing must stand and if there is a retest, my hunch is that,  while they may be some readjustments with a different sample, the date will emerge again as medieval . I stress PRESUMPTION.   I have no reason to prefer any one date over another – after all there was ONCE a burial shroud or burial cloths of Jesus, just as  there was a cross and nails, and probably a Crown of Thorns and a stone that was rolled away from the tomb and goodness knows how many other  relics. No one is suggesting that these relics never existed at one point in the first century.  The question to me as an archaeologist/historian (stress, this largely an archaeology problem- I have worked on first century AD digs and I know how little survives) is did these particular items survive or not?  The probability , overwhelmingly, is not, as a bloodied sheet would have been unlikely to have been kept by Jews ( I stand to be corrected by Jews on that one), relics were not collected as such before c. 380( just as they are not collected by Protestants today) and damp would almost certainly have destroyed the cloth. This is common sense and this is where I always find it easier to start when working on a historical problem. That is where I started with the Shroud case when I was working on my history of relics – there has never been any other relic from the first century that has been proved to be such – so this one would really have had to have a most unusual history, one that certainly has NOT been tracked by Ian Wilson. The best way out of this is to do another C-14 testing. At present there is not a shred of carbon-14  evidence for a first century date. There is not even a calibrated set of results for vermilion deterioration so even if samples were gathered, or failed to be gathered, from across the Shroud , there would be nothing to test them against. (Rogers appears to have been a loner here and no one has followed him up.)Of course, the way that the Shroud has been mauled about by various parties with no experience of working with ancient textiles has made the Vatican suspicious about passing it out again. But I suspect that if any carbon-14 dating laboratory with an international reputation could put forward a coherent case for retesting, they might give in. Perhaps you and your supporters could work on this. If your case is as clear as you say it is,then surely a  professional laboratory somewhere would back you.  Certainly Oxford are quite open to it as they showed with their testing of John Jackson’s theory of carbon monoxide contamination (and they have made it quite clear that they are open to new evidence- what more can you ask?- they are certainly one of the world’s top r-c labs).So let’s see how we go. I appreciate that your interest in the issue is many times stronger than mine for whom the Shroud is only one of hundreds and thousands of relics, authentic or otherwise, that still exist. As I say above, all these relics recorded in the gospels did exist at some point , but did they survive? That seems to me to be the question to focus on. I can see that I approach this question in a very different way from the way you do, but why not?

Why don’t you get in touch with Oxford -or some other lab. as I suggest to see if you can get all this restarted. It obviously worries you a lot more than it does me.  If the Shroud is first century , well ,we know a shroud or burial cloths existed then ( see John’s gospel) so , extremely unlikely though it might be , it is just possible that it survived. We may also find the Crown of Thorns, and some of those phials of blood may really have been taken from Jesus on the cross (just check that they are AB), and the stone that closed up the Tomb would not have suffered the problem of damp, so presumably it is still around somewhere. Then what?  Most Christians broadly accept the historical evidence of the gospels,so  not that much would change if some of the recorded backing evidence ever turned up. As one clergy friend of mine said when we were discussing this, it matters nothing to me whether the Shroud is genuine or not- I will still believe in the Resurrection. Still, if I was you, I would work really hard on getting  a new testing to set your mind at rest.Now the other issue. Here is an extract from Holgar Klein’s article on relics in Constantinople. If you google the author you will find it on his website. If I was looking for a way in which the Shroud or any other relic came to Constantinople from Jerusalem I would start here. There are many more documentary sources than Wilson can ever find in support of his theory ( as listed below) and they are much earlier – but,of course, he is so obsessed by the Edessa route, he won’t consider much more likely routes for the transfer of relics from Jerusalem to Constantinople. We are talking here of the 330s!! As I do quite a lot of work on Constantinople, and have been there recently setting up a study tour I am leading in October, I can tell you that the column of Constantine still stands although it is very battered.We even have a wonderful ivory relief from about 420 showing the arm of the martyr Stephen coming into Constantinople.Keep with Wilson if you must but there are far,far better historians around- Klein is one of them, and here he provides a much more plausible possible route for  the Shroud than Wilson ever does. If it came into the city from Jerusalem in the fourth century, was included among the relics that Pulcheria placed in the Blachernae chapel in the 420s, kept away from the damp (unlike the Edessa image in the city gate), then this would explain why Robert de Clari saw a burial shroud with an image of Christ on it  in this very same chapel eight hundred years later. You also have a far shorter time between the crucifixion and the transfer of the relic to account for.‘It is a common belief – based by and large on Ambrose’s funerary oration for Theodosius the Great, some passages in the church histories of Sokrates, Sozomenos, and Theodoret, and much later patriographic records – that Constantinople’s rise as a cult center for the relics of Christ’s Passion has its origins in the time of the city’s foundation under Constan- tine the Great. According to these sources, Constantine himself received part of the relic of the True Cross and the Holy Nails from his mother Helena, who allegedly discovered them on Mount Golgotha during her pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In the capital, Constantine is said to have enclosed these relics – together with holy chrism, the crosses of the two thieves, and the palladion of Athena – inside the honorific column and statue that adorned the emperor’s Forum.’Why not the burial shroud as well?","date":"April 24, 2012 at 12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Very glad to hear of the Emmanuel Poulle article which I did not know. This seems very much on the right lines- and certainly a better documented explanation than  that de Wesselow’s  (in his new book The Sign) and others’ claims that the Mandylion is the Turin Shroud.  The Pharos relics seem to have survived the sack of 1204 as they were in the imperial palace and were then distributed ,sold or used as surety for loans ( the Crown of Thorns) by the Latin emperors who ruled in Constantinople until the restoration of the Byzantine Greek emperors in 1261. Most of them went to Louis IX’s Sainte-Chapelle. In the official guidebook to the Sainte-Chapelle there is an engraving of 1790 showing the Chasse, or main display altar, in the chapel, and seventeen listed relics from the Passion and Cruxifixion including a Holy Shroud, most of which can be linked back to the relics list of the Pharos chapel. However, there is no definite mention of a Mandylion there and it is assumed that the Shroud are the ‘sheets’ mentioned in the Pharos chapel as being of cheap cloth (listed as separate from the Mandylion in the Pharos list of 1201) .So one must be cautious in being sure that the Mandylion was among those transferred to Paris but it may well have been.The closest shroud in description  to the Turin Shroud is, as you say, the one in the Blachernae Chapel (which does not mean, of course, that is is the Turin Shroud because there is no record of what happened to it after 1204 and  and of course there were many shrouds, face cloths, images ,etc, around in medieval Europe – Oviedo, the Vera Iconica in Rome,etc,).

I always thought that and when I read Wilson on it, it was clear that he had failed to tackle the basic questions and used the sources in a totally misleading way. Believe him if you must. He has no background in the history of the period and I would prefer to rely on trained Byzantine scholars such as Klein and Belting.We know a shroud with a full length body image on it  that was claimed to be the burial shroud of Christ was in the Blachernae Chapel in the early thirteenth century ( Robert de Clari) and was exposed. So it must have got there somehow. The question is how. If I was doing further research on this, which I am not, I would follow up all the early sources, and there are many,which deal with the links between the imperial family and Jerusalem from 330s onwards during which we know that a lot of early relics linked to the Crucifixion were brought from Jerusalem into Constantinople. As I have not been through these original sources, I would not know whether there was a shroud or any form of cloth mentioned.It would be a chance whether any document mentioning it survived or not as we only have a tiny proportion of the original documents,  I would be particularly interested in Pulcheria because she had her own links with Jerusalem and imported a number of relics from there- see the relief of her welcoming the arm of Stephen in c.420 which came, of course, from Jerusalem. You can find some preliminary details in my book Holy Bones, pages 40-41. So it is possible that a Shroud was among them- this seems the most likely time for it to come but you are free to suggest any other period when it arrived. You have to explain its presence somehow!You say the Shroud would have great fanfare but I don’t think it would have rated as high as the Cross (this was the most treasured relic of the Pharos Chapel as you will see from reading Klein) or the Crown of Thorns. Nor would a burial cloth have had the same resonance as an image of the LIVING Christ given by him to king Agbar,  Remember the imperial family had many relics of the Passion and Crucifixion including the actual blood of Christ and the shroud would probably have been quite low in the pecking order. Note too that another image of the face of Christ while alive, the Veil of Veronica , was rated even more highly than the Mandylion. It is always a mistake to assume that, among the hundreds of relics of the Passion and the crucifixion, that the Shroud would have had any special status.The Blachernae Shroud cannot have been the Mandylion as, and here Wilson actually provides the evidence , on p. 240 of his 2011 edition, that the  Mandylion was in 1090 locked in a chest and only the emperor  was allowed to see it.In 1201 it is listed as still being in the Pharos Chapel. So it is certainly not the same  as the purported burial shroud of Christ in the Blachernae Chapel which was the other side of town.Once on Constantinople, the Shroud would, of course, have been stored under cover in the church sacristy, so protecting it even from the damp of Constantinople, along with the other cloth relics we know were in the Blachernae chapel, notably the robe worn by the Virgin Mary. It would have been much more likely to have survived there than in the gate at Edessa!As I have said, this is where I would direct my research because there is clearly a much more plausible ‘story line’ here. Like any good historian , if I did not find the documentary evidence to support the case, i would not twist the documents to make a case and would probably end up saying that one can only speculate from the limited sources!Most commentators who have tried to find the link between the Turin Shroud and an earlier history in Constantinople have elected the Blachernae Shroud as the ONLY shroud that seems to have any relevance to the debate. The Pharos sheets are said to have been of poor cloth and there is no record of an image on them, the Mandylion was locked away and was, anyway, ALWAYS said to have been an image of Christ while alive. I don’t know whoever first  put forward the idea that the Mandylion was the Shroud- it makes no sense to me at all.I hope I have shown you and any other readers that there is more to this than Wilson ever suggests and, for those who do believe that the Shroud is genuine and came down through Constantinople, some much more promising avenues to explore than the watery Edessa route!

No , the idea that it was Christ while alive  is not weak. It was the absolute essence of understanding the Mandylion and there has never been any other legend attached to it. There is no way that the image of the Turin Shroud , especially if shown at full length , could be interpreted to be that of Christ while alive . Yet the Mandylion is said, in several different documents ,to have been an image of Christ taken during his lifetime ,either as a gift to Agbar or from his face in the Garden of Gethsemene ( ‘sweat ‘ comes when you are alive, not dead!) .But if you can’t see that ,there is little more that I can do for you.

I still think that linen discoloured by having five hundred years of a first sealed,then painted, surface which disintegrated with constant handlng is the best bet.

I quoted from an English study InYork that showed many simply within one city . Yet as the author of  that report said there is not a single painted medieval cloth extant from the whole of medieval England.Why?  It was because the attrition rate was enormously high. As I have repeated on numerous occasions the technique of painting on medieval linen was to seal the outer fibrin of the cloth with a gesso and then apply  a primer or paint. As many of these cloths were used as hangings , banners or flags it was vital that they were not starched up but they still had to be sealed so that the pigments did not penetrate through and make it difficult to have a different painting in the other side. A very difficult balancing act and the gesso appliers  must have taken years to learn their skill. It was ,of course, vital to have a relatively dense weave, similar to that of the Shroud,or otherwise the surface of the gesso would not hold.The problem was that the pigmented surface fragmented very easily. And so we read of hangings that were guasto, worn out and needed replacing. Most must have simply been thrown away when the images became too faint.If you google , ‘ calcium carbonate gesso’  you will find that calcium carbonate is  indicative of gesso. My professor felt that what Adler and Heller found was also indicative of animal proteins such as one might expect from, say, a rabbit skin glue or similar glue. The extent and ‘largeness’ of the carbon carbonate is described in the STURP physics and chemistry paper but I am not near my office to check it. (Hugh usually has such facts at his finger  tips!)So you have good evidence for the base. You then need to move on to the many depictions and descriptions of the Shroud as it was from the fifteenth century onwards with. A very rich collection of depictions exist from between 1578 and 1703 when for reasons that are not clear, expositions began to fall off. We really do need a full data base of these so that there can be intensive scholarship applied to them. It may well be that the images became fainter so that the crowds of 70,000 that are recorded at some expositions could no longer see them and so there was not so much point  in having an annual exposition. Today the images can not be seen close up and the Shroud had to be framed to prevent further damage to its surface.There is a remarkably high coincidence among different artists over 150 years that show features that have now disappeared, thumbs, long hair at the back, a Crown of Thorns in place ( and this is confirmed by observers who also described it). It is hard to know how these could not have been painted.It is not part of my argument that there has to be remaining pigment any more than the very shadowy formerly painted images on the Zittau Veil have any remaining pigments. I expect that once a pigmented surface began to disintegrate it fell off pretty quickly. Yet both McCrone and STURP found some pigments, McCrone thought that they were part of the original painting, STURP had the idea ,that I must admit I find unlikely, that somehow  pigments fell into the cloth when other paintings were being applied to it but somehow did not fall off again when the shroud was displayed.We know that medieval painted linens, if extraordinarily rare today, were very common in medieval times. So that when one finds shadowy images like that on the Shroud and compares them to the. Images of  the Zittau Veil that we know for certain were painted, as many of the painted panels survive alongside those that have lost their pigments, then we have a plausible reason for believing that the Shroud was originally painted.I remain totally unconvinced by alternative explanations for the images. They seem wildly speculative. I am conservative by nature and prefer to work within the context of image making in linen that was the most widely used. Why abandon it if no coherent alternative can me suggested. (I will leave those who still want to argue about how the images were created if not through an original painting to get on with their speculations.)So the challenge is on to refute me!","date":"December 10, 2014 at 11:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/09/should-we-be-rethinking-the-vp8-and-3d-images/","cat":"3d","title":"Should we be rethinking the VP8 and 3D images?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Calcium carbonate is, of courses, natural but when you find it spread across the surface of a piece of cloth, the context is most likely one where it was used to seal the cloth- I leave it to you to suggest alternative explanations.

I am away from my big pile of printed out Shroud articlesRabbit skin glue was the most common ‘glue’ to mix with the calcium.

Report, p30-1 PDF version.They didn’t even ask anyone who was expert In medieval linen painting ( and it is clear from reading the early part of the report that the Idea that this might be the remnants of earlier images did not even occur to them!!). When you know what the most common form of making images on medieval linen is and you don’t even examine similar cases for comparison, this is clearly a limited report. Admittedly  we did not have the Zittau Veil conserved until the mid 1990s so a painted linen with many of its panels decayed was not there for comparison but you would have thought they would have made SOME effort.If you research medieval pigments you will find that there were many used with different make-ups according to where the minerals or plants were gathered. Where STURP went wrong was not even to make the effort to talk to someone who knew about the variety of pigments used. Actually what is most interesting about the STURP report is how they only consulted within their own group as if they had a monopoly of expertise in iconography ( those all over scourge marks not related to their first appearance in iconography until after 1300, something that they would have been told if they had consulted any art historian specialising in Passion iconography ), weaving (the width of the Shroud is typical of a medieval treadle loom, cf the sections of the Zittau Veil), and painted linens.In fact,they chose to disregard examining all the areas that suggest that the Shroud is medieval. Perhaps this is just the narrowness of specialisms but you would have thought they would have asked someone about how the Shroud might have been woven. Knowledge of the fit with a medieval treadle loom,although not absolutely conclusive, might well have saved them the expense of hauling that equipment all the way to Turin in the hope of finding something pre-medieval – which,of course, they found no  evidence for. So they left us with the Shroud as some kind of mystery when there seem to be perfectly coherent explanations. They ,or those close to STURP, also put forward the idea that the Shroud is either authentic or the work of a forger. Again, with no one on the team knowing anything about medieval relic cults , they failed to realise that many objects acquired spiritual status usually due to associated miracles. If you look at the gospel accounts and the representations of Christ’s burial shroud that worshippers would have seen on the walls of churches, no forger would have tried it on with a large double image cloth. They did get away with the Cadouin Shroud that  had no images on it and was similar to the representations of Christ being laid on a single sheet which is why that was  the most popular of the burial shroud shrines.","date":"December 12, 2014 at 3:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/09/should-we-be-rethinking-the-vp8-and-3d-images/","cat":"3d","title":"Should we be rethinking the VP8 and 3D images?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Different micros copyists with varying levels of expertise have come up with different opinions as to whether there is vermilion on the Shroud.

If you look at the lithograph of 1868 that Beldon Scott reproduces you can see that one figure has lost its paint from the shoulders down while the rest is still intact. By 1898 the disintegration of the painted images seems to have been complete.McCrone found some remnants of the pigments, STURP found the remans of the calcium carbonate that made up the gesso, so far so good, but things may have deteriorated still further since then and even a modern scanner, miles ahead of anything in 1978, ,might not be able to pick anything up. I hope we see one day.If you follow Cennini’s instructions on how to apply gesso to the outer fibrils of a linen and then paint on top when it is dry, you don’t have to use laser beams because you only have to wait five hundred years and the linen under the gesso and paint will become discoloured – as it is discoloured through the gesso and paint ,it will vary according to the thickness of the original pigment and will only be on the very top of the underlying cloth as found by STURP and the 1976 Commission. The central panels of the Zittau Lenten Veil show very similar images to those on the Shroud . Here the pigments were steamed off in the Second World War.The two figures on the Shroud are not of the same body- the arms at the back could not possibly be the same arms of the front as you would have to hunch up the shoulders at the back ( which they are not) to cross the arms at the front.The artist must have believed that there was a sacred element to the Image of Edessa/ Veil of Veronica face off Christ as he reproduced it on the Shroud without adapting the hair to show it falling down.

All this has, of course, been well covered by scholars, Caroline Walker Bynum in her Wonderful Blood, James Marrow in his works on Passion iconography( where he dates the emergence of all-over scourging to 1300) and Jeffrey Hamburger who is particularly interested in the emergence of these aspects in Southern Germany. The iconography of the Shroud, the all-over scourging, the pattern of the blood flows, fits well into this change and so one can argue for the creation of the images on the Shroud then.The alternative is to say that  the Shroud inspired this dramatic change.

I wish I had more time to do that myself! But with four trips to the Mediterranean in six weeks, the Shroud is only a small part of my work!A major problem is the lack of comparative studies. Is Colin going to look at the faded Zittau Lenten Veil in the church museum at Zittau in Saxony? This is a painted linen from 1472, much larger than the Shroud (8.2 metres by 6.80 metres), with 90 separate paintings on the linen. It had survived relatively intact until the Second World War when it was looted by some Russian soldiers who used it  to cover a steam bath. This alone caused the pigments to fall off in some areas and it was then left in the damp so parts were very faded. It is not only important in itself but it has received a full restoration programme and the contrast between those areas that remain faded and those that are relatively intact is easy to see. There is a full report in Caroline Villers, The Fabric of Images (London 200). Villers has a mass of material for those interested in how medieval linens were painted..Then there is the Adoration of the Magi, no 35, in Diane Wolfthal’s The Beginnings of Netherlandish Canvas Painting , Cambridge UP 1989 now in the Museum of Prints and drawings in Berlin. Here the images seem to have suffered from abrasion but much of the original remains intact, allowing one to see how a particular painted linen might have decayed.Even with their faded areas, these are still intact enough to be displayed- there must be lots of other examples that are hidden away in storerooms.  I am not going to take Colin seriously unless he he can show that he has made a sustained effort to look at other faded linens from the Middle Ages before embarking on a theory of his own. He needs to show how the Shroud is different from these but you can’t do that until you have looked at the others!Similarly ,we need to make a data base of all the known depictions and copies of the Shroud so that scholars and others can independently make their own assessments of their relevance and accuracy by comparing them against each other.

It can be seen in the same place on the Besancon Shroud.I know that specialists in medieval drama ( Cambridge academics no less) are interested in my approach as it gives the Shroud a great deal of importance as a lone survivor.It also confirms that the Shroud was originally created as an object o veneration as this was more than a stage prop but a ceremonial cloth that was displayed to the congregation and then taken in solemn procession to be laid on the high altar.It may well have become associated with miracles and then Jeanne de Charny , who may have been in a state of high anxiety in the 1350s from the devastation of the Black Death and the absence on her husband in war – he died,of course in 1356 – began passing it off as authentic, perhaps because she herself had had a miraculous vision or whatever.

As it is no longer extant ( well, some say a faded cloth with just a few marks on it is it – others say it was destroyed in the sack of Rome in 1527) we do not know how the surface was created but the many copies, very common after 1350,  suggest that in its heyday it was very vivid indeed – cf the descriptions of the Shroud.Contrast this with the cult of the Shroud initiated it seems by a wife of a knight in small chapel in an out of the way village in Northern France. Like many cults in the traumatic years just after the Black Death, it catches on for a brief period in the 1350s but by the 1390s thevShroud has been transformed by Clement VII into an object deserving  of sufficient veneration to earn an indulgence but clearly proclaimed not to be authentic.

It has things we don’t understand about it, but we also don’t understand how medieval craftsmen created the Sutton Hoo purse with its tiny garnets and there are lots of other medieval skills we are not able to replicate.

Imagine a situation,horribly close to us with the Ebola outbreak, where through an enormous area half the population has died. The survivors are deeply traumatised ,their lives disrupted. This was Europe in the 1350s and all kinds of relic cults sprung up, flourished briefly and then faded. The Shroud was just one of these and there was nothing particularly different about it so far as we know. What was believed by some, and we really have no idea exactly who, as the actual burial cloth of Christ one of many on offer, of course, in the traumatIsed 1350s had settled by the 1390s into something very different , a cult of an object of veneration given Church approval,alongside many thousands of similar objects. But this time it was firmly declared not to be the real thing.. There is really very little evidence that the Shroud was considered important in the next fifty years by  anyone other than Margaret de Charny – she trIed to display it but it was declared inauthentic, e.g. In 1449 when she tried to exhibit it. It is the canny Savoys who start making something of it and, as I believe, the images were still striking, they were able to display it in enormous arenas such as the Piazza Castello in Turin.from 1578. Of course ,with crowds of 40,000 packed into the Piazza, no one would have been able to see it close up but if the images were as strong  as I think they were they were this hardly mattered,All this is indicative of a relic cult that appeared like so many others in the traumatised 1350s, was transformed into something else in 1390, looked like vanishing from view by the 1450s and then struck lucky when a royal family, not the Church,  promoted it in support of their own dynasty.There is absolutely nothing here to suggest that there was anything strange physically about the Shroud’s images – or certainly no evidence that they attracted special attention EXCEPT the blood stains that are remarked on again and again.I really don’t see where you are coming from, Colin, and where you get this idea from that the images in their original state  were In some way different from any of the other thousands of images from this period and furthermore were unlike otHer images in being immune to chemical change.However, I shall leave you to get on with the lab work but I think we all have the right to see that you have peers in your support -publication in a respected journal perhaps?","date":"November 8, 2014 at 4:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/colin-berry-wants-feedback/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Wants Feedback"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"No, I publish long books for university presses that have to go through rigorous academic checking before being accepted as a proposal and then are subject to anonymous reviewing before the press will accept them. Been through that with two of the world’ s top presses, Yale and Oxford and if you go to the Yale US website and look up my Holy Bones you will see the reviews of my  relics book.Cennino Cennini , a fifteenth century craftsman, wrote a manual on how to paint. The section on linen says you apply a gesso with a knife on the outer fibrils of the cloth only. He recommended calcium sulphate as the binder with , usually,  rabbit skin glue. North of the Alps analysis shows that they used calcium carbonate. So no brush marks because a brush would not have been able to wipe off excess. The aim, and it must have been a very skilful process, one  which like many other medieval processes no one would probably have the patience to master today, was to create things like painted flags that would flutter in the breeze.There is a wide range of original sources on medieval paintings and pigments ,etc, and surely you should master those for details of all these techniques before you set out to create one of your own. Then there are all the modern works on medieval painting. It is a large area. Even though it comes a lot into my professional life, I still have to ask for help on many issues.So when STURP found that the images was only on the surface of the fibrils and then large quantities of calcium carbonate, this is what one might have expected. When I submitted all the Heller and Adler articles to a professor of physiology, he suggested that while he was totally unconvinced that there was human blood on the Shroud, Heller and Adler may have been finding the remnants of the animal glue. I don’ think he thought the quality of the papers was really up to much anyway, let alone proof of blood.So where are you on this , Colin? Were STURP right or wrong? I believe that tied to the other evidence this comes together to suggest a fairly standard painted linen.With sources from 1449, 1474,1503, 1517 and 1534 all remarking on the predominance of the bloodstains, that is enough for  me to accept that they were there!I am working within the mainstream, not Shroudies mainstream, but academic mainstream in setting out my hypotheses.

We have a reference in 301 to a loom that appears to have been of great sophistication that may be related to this weaving.With a treadle loom, known in Europe since c 1000, things are very different. Because the weaver works with hands and feet simultaneously, it weaves at three times the speed leading to these looms taking over quickly. However, it only has one weaver and the width of his arms limited the width of the weave to less than 130 cms. However,he has the advantage of length as this loom allows the finished weave to be wound around rods. The next advantage, says my expert, is that the treadles can be manipulated to create more difficult patterns more quickly and so she has confirmed that a three-in- one could be produced on a standard treadle loom, thus by,- passing the highly  sophisticated loom needed in the third century.So this is what the expert opinion on the subject seems to be.

It is not as of fourteenth century artists were not capable of wonderful paintings, far more impressive than the Shroud, But they would need a reason to create a negative image and the Quem Queritis ceremony gave them one. The commission would have been to do a painting that showed the marks of a crucified body as if they had been transferred onto the grave cloth. So this is what we have ( as the wound on the left side shows). We would have to think up another context in which a negative was needed and research from there. Perhaps indeed this (and the Besancon Shroud) is the only one- but it would not have been beyond an artist of the day. There remain lots of problems. Why is the head of Christ that of a man standing, for instance (this is echoed by depictions from the past which all show that the hair at the back was also of a man standing)? One suggestion I have had is that the inept nature of the join of the head to the body shows that they used a template for the head and painted the body separately but this must be speculative.I was doing a presentation last week and comparing the pose of the man on the Shroud with other medieval examples and we were looking at a sculpture from an entombment scene where they had carved the hair falling back as one would expect from a lying figure and it was, of course, nothing like the rigid hair of the head of the Man on the Shroud.","date":"February 22, 2015 at 10:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/21/colin-berry-stop-calling-the-faint-image-a-faint-image/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  Stop Calling the Faint Image a Faint Image"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am waiting for expert guidance from a textile specialist on this but what we appear to have is the shadows of the original images after the pigments have fallen off.

By this time the pigments would have been In for place for five hundred years and so the shadows on the  cloth underneath would vary according to the  thickness of the original paint. So dark colours might leave a lighter shadow underneath and light colours a darker one and this may explain the apparent negative features, which go alongside the left hand wound.

Once you have an outer surface you can paint what you want , even hundreds of marks of bloodstains not a single one of which has a significant blood flow.As always such paintings are very vulnerable to disintegration as they are just on the surface if the cloth so they need to be kept on a flat surface to avoid disintegration .Once the pigments have been on for hundreds of years there is inevitably some discolouration of the linen underneath when they disintegrate, as on the Zittern Veil.The scourge marks on the Shroud cannot possibly come from a person with a beating heart – some of the marks would have cut deeper than others and there would be different levels of mark and bloodstain. On  a real body with this scourging there would have been many other welts and bruises that did not break the skin in addition to the 372 or whatever that actually did on the ‘realbody’ hypothesis. It does not make any kind of sense that a man could also carry a cross after a technique  of intensive front and back flagellation not recorded anywhere in the ancient world.A fourteenth century discoloured linen after the disintegration of the pigments , fitting the iconography of Isaiah 1:6, is by miles the best hypothesis.Sometimes common sense is needed.","date":"May 19, 2015 at 12:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Dave- look at the helpful illustration at the beginning of the Faccini Fanti article. Do you really believe that blood oozing from wounds from a flagellation would have settled in that very precise manner in every case as shown here with the intensity the same on the cloth where the body had lain as on the top which covered the body – so that presumably the blood oozed upwards against gravity? You could not possibly carry out this intensive flagellation, make sure that the skin where it was broken was done so in an even way and that some hours later blood would have been oozing out on both front and back of the body in exactly the same pattern(with the variation for the three instruments that Faccini noticed) from each and every wound. At least one can say that the blood knew where to stop in each and every case.You say these experts have.’ruled in this case’ .  There is no rule in the world of science( and common sense observation) . Thank goodness we don’t have to accept all these so-called experts and can make up up our own minds within the sphere of our own specialist interests. I suspect that none of these forensics experts had every studied fourteenth century Passion iconography. Once you see similar patterns of bloodstains on fourteenth century examples, you begin to put together a very different picture.These marks could easily have been achieved, if rather unimaginatively so,  by an artist. Much more likely. I am sticking with a fourteenth century creation- those who read the (Anglican) Church Times will find my views expressed in more detail in an 1,800 word article in their  May 8th edition – it was aimed at their specific ( mainly clergy and conventional Anglican) readership (23,000) and may not travel further.And yes, it was published there on the recommendation of a Professor of Church History at Oxford.","date":"May 20, 2015 at 1:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"No, David, the other way around- the artist of the Shroud was following the conventional iconography of his day, not only in the scourge marks but in the blood flows along the arms and the squiggles of the bloodstains of the head. These features are too widely spread geographically to have been the result of anyone seeing the Shroud but an artist who had kept up with trends in the representations of the Passion would have included them.The illustration provided by Hugh above makes my earlier point clearly. For a scourge wound from a real body to have left a mark means that blood or other liquid was oozing from it when the body was laid on the Shroud and this oozing was persistent enough to have seeped through the top of the Shroud when it was laid over the body. This is bizarre enough when the flagellation took place some time before the crucifixion and death of Jesus. However, why is it that in every case the blood flows just so far as to leave the impression but no further in every case – to the extent that Faccini was even able to to distinguish three different instruments. This could never have happened in real life after a real flagellation which would have been a much rougher affair.However, for an artist no problem, he can paint whatever he likes and limit the bloodstains to precise areas, especially when he is trying to represent a biblical verse. Have all these forensic experts actually seen bloodstains on a piece of cloth that don’t seep into the capillaries. If it is gessoed in the medieval way, no problem.Also I don’t buy  the medieval forger  idea. No forger would have hoped to have taken in anyone by a large imaged cloth when none are mentioned in the gospels or represented in the iconography of the deposition. If produced for the Quem Queritis ceremony, however, all that was needed was a symbolic representation of the dead body – the artist did not even try to show the face of Christ as that of a man lying down. So long as the images could be seen in the dim early Easter light, bloodstains and all, the figures larger than life size for the medieval period and doubled up, that was all that was required. He did not even make the two bodies the same size.The scourge marks are,in fact, one of the clearest piece of evidence that the Shroud never covered a real body.","date":"May 19, 2015 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Dave, I assume  that as a researcher in this area, you have a copy of John Beldon Scott’s Architecture for the Shroud with its wealth of illustrations- the essential handbook for all those following the post-1355 history of the Shroud.. So figure 42, p.60, which is a1583 fresco from the Galleria delle Carte Geografiche in the Vatican shows clearly that the images at that date were clear enough to be seen from about two hundred yards away- note how the onlookers are gazing at the Shroud from this far away. This fresco is,of course, backed by many other depictions of the Shroud also illustrated in Beldon Scott.If you look at the illustrations of the Holkham Bible of c.1330, or the Roettgen Pieta – but there are many other examples  from the fourteenth century- you will see how typical the Shroud is of fourteenth century iconography of the day.My argument is that we have a discoloured linen left after the disintegration of the pigments, probably in the nineteenth century. The fundamental mistake made by many researchers is to assume that the images now are as they always have been, without realising that painted linens were inherently fragile and easily disintegrated as the pigments were only on a gesso surface on the outer fibrils of the cloth and did not penetrate it. STURP looked for paint that had probably vanished ( although McCrone claims some tiny particles were still there).

Many of them have thumbs and these seem to be at the same angle suggesting that they were once there.We need a database of all these images, not only the engravings and frescoes ( e.g. the one in the Vatican of 1583), but also the cloth images so that scholars can study them online as they can now study Shroudscope.I believe hat it was crucial for the display of the Shroud that the images could be seen from afar off and, following some recent research on this it is clear that painted images were often repainted as they disintegrated very quickly. This may explain some of the variations in the position of the legs but until we have experts assessing the database we shall not be able to come to any conclusions on this. The painting on, following the Trent decree,and the subsequent disintegration of, the loincloth does seem to fit the evidence and could explain the lighter patch on the buttocks.The final  disintegration of the images and gesso, which were placed just on the very outer surface of a linen cloth, seems to have taken place in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries- the 1868 lithograph that Beldon Scott shows is the first one showing that the Shroud had to be framed and one of the images has deteriorated from the shoulders down. Anyone have access to the cathedral archives?By 1898 the images had virtually disappeared.Whether there are any pigments and gesso left is anyone’s guess after all that has gone on. Things have moved on so much from 1978 that a new examination of the surface of the cloth is urgently needed. The finding of calcium carbonate by STURP is primie facie evidence of an original gesso but as the STURP tests have never been replicated one should not rest too much on this.If the Shroud is not examined again, it is probable that examination of other images on medieval linen cloths which have lost their pigments will back or refute my hypothesis that this is linen discoloured by centuries of being overlaid by gesso and paint, the variations, which give the three-d negative effects,  reflecting the original thickness of the pigments.So I am keeping my eyes open on the research on painted linens which is now a growing area of interest.i hope something of importance should turn up which will throw light on the Shroud.Blood- well, again the tests need replicating but there was so much relic blood around in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries -see Carline Walker Bynum’s book Wonderful Blood – that the incentives for adding it to make money must have been powerful. The redness of the existing  stains seems to offer insuperable problems but perhaps someone can come up with a forensic expert who can provide examples.I don’t expect any of these issue to be resolved one way or the other quickly so it is a waiting game. Scientific research is moving on so fast and it is good that painted linens are a focus so one can be optimistic. After all no one was expecting the BM to solve the dating of the Horses of St.Mark’s so conclusively by finding other dated examples of the same techniques of casting and gilding.","date":"June 12, 2015 at 4:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/11/comment-promoted-charles-freeman-comes-closest/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted:  Charles Freeman Comes Closest"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Well, I am only suggesting further research and I think it is clear from what I wrote earlier, that I know in what direction I would like that research to take.

What tended to happen was the the painted surface disintegrated and fragmented with continual folding and refolding. Beldon Scott quotes a 1580 letter from Carlo Borromeo’s architect  (Borromeo was pushing for a chapel for the Shroud) that expressed concern that the Shroud should be ‘preserved and displayed without the danger  (sic) of folding and unfolding it.’ With lots of new work on painted linens coming out, we now have examples where microscopic analysis shows that the cracks in the paint were often painted over.  The discoloration of the present images may be the result of centuries of contact between the painted surface and the linen as buffered through the gesso.This is perhaps why the discoloration does not penetrate below the outside surface of the linen as there is no way that it could in these circumstances. It may also explain the fuzziness at the edges of the images ( such that one cannot even give a precise measurement of the height of the man on the Shroud). This is no more than a hypothesis that needs checking out with a more sophisticated technical examination of the Shroud with modern scanning equipment. Unlikely to happen so it remains no more than a hypothesis.The alternative will be to exploit resent research on  painted linens whose images have deteriorated to see whether  comparisons can be made  with the Shroud images.

In the end what matters is that someone finds a solution to the Shroud that gets widespread academic support. We differ in that I start from building from existing work on painted linens, medieval versus ancient weaves, and Passion iconography so that if I decide to publish I can quote academic support  for my views.Your approach is to work away in the flour bowl in your shed and, presumably,  hope that fellow scientists will eventually endorse what you have done.Good luck.

The date and nature of the images could probably be sorted in a couple of hours with state of the art scanning equipment that picks up minute pigments.What I find difficult is your apparent view that the Shroud has remained with any degradation of images or linen so that what we have now is exactly what existed in1350. However, that is better than assuming that what exists now Is exactly what existed in AD 30 which appears to be the STURP approach. I have never seen any STURP paper which says ‘ we must start by working out how the present Shroud might have looked 2,000 years ago’.

I work from the depictions of expositions of which there are probably fifty different ones over the years,  by  different artists,of course.. I start with the Tempesta engraving of1613  as Tempesta was famous in his day for accuracy as an engraver. Then we look at other examples from1578 to 1703 to check whether Tempesta should be trusted. Obviously the three I take from before 1613 cannot have been influenced by him but they show similar feature to those in the later 1600s.You make the fundamental mistake in asserting that the images on the Shroud were created  faint, my argument with illustrations is that they became faint over time ( the nineteenth centurY seems to show the deterioration of the images although a lot more work by profEssional art historians is needed here ).it is just a different way of approaching the issue and I think more fruitful in getting to the heart of the issue.What is essential is to assemble a data base of  all the depictions of expositions- they really are fascinating when you start comparing them with each other to work out the features like the Crown of Thorns ,shown with lots of prickly thorns , that are now lost.

For instance , your loincloth issue. There is, of course, no problem in a loincloth being added – it is no different from many other relics that coverings were created for- look at the wonderful gold costume that the Volto Santo is decked out in when processed or gems sewn onto relics. No one saw this as a problem any more than they did in cutting out part of the Shroud to give away as a relic probably in the 1530s ( or STURP taking off parts of the image to the US – no one seems to have seen this as desecrating a holy relic but  it could be argued that it was by those who think the Shroud is authentic. If it is not authentic that is not a problem although it may have been unwise to separate elements of the Shroud in this way – I still don’t know whether they are kept together in proper conservation conditions and what the rules for access by scholars are.)However, Russ’s point is valid. Is this a loincloth painted onto the Shroud or one painted on by artists who were unanimous in showing it? ( I have at least thirty examples  that show it -the 1998 catalogue of the Savoy family’s collection is enormously helpful here ). This is why we need ALL of them online so that you,Russ, and other Shroud researchers can freely argue from a common data base. I think it would be an excellent study for a Master’s dissertation by a budding art historian to collect them all together but there would probably need to be finance available to that those images still subject to copyright can be paid for.As a historian I just believe in assembling all the evidence and opening it up to public and academic discussion.

We see the same on the Besancon Shroud ( which is independent of the Shroud as one can see from the iconography) so the Turin Shroud is not unique in this respect.I suspect that some of the so-called copies of the Shroud in Spain may well be independent creations ( e.g. those made after 1532 without the fire marks). It will be interesting to see if they also show the wound on the left. if they do and are not direct copies of the Shroud, this suggests that this became as conventional for these Quem Queritis and other liturgical grave clothes as showing the wound on the right was in conventional Crucifixion scenes.Certainly the artist of the Shroud INTENDED it to be a negative as shown by the placing of the wound.

No one in the Middle Ages would  been taken in by a cloth with images on it when there were none mentioned in the gospels or seen on any depiction of the burial of Christ. This is why the Church was so easily able to prevent it becoming a medieval cult of an authentic relic – but they were outwitted by a secular ruler- the Savoys – who realised they had the space and influence to claim it was the real thing.In his study of the Quem Queritis ceremonies , Karl Young in the 1930s found four hundred accounts of these ceremonies all involving the display of the grave clothes before the congregation ( so there must have been very many more). So we know that at one time hundreds of these clothes existed. But the attrition rate is high. We know of hundreds of documented painted linen cloths in medieval England- we do not have a single survivor. So the painter of the Shroud would have had lots of models to draw on. It is is a major mistake to think that because the Shroud is a unique survivor tHat it was the only one ever made!! The painter would have lots of models, perhaps even a template to copy from. He may even have been making a replacement of one that had decayed.We are very much at tHe same stage as research on the Egyptian pyramids were in the 1880s. They were so ‘ unique’ all kinds of stories went on about them, with their measurements even being thought to be the source of British weights and measures. Gradually serious research began, they got dated and gradually they were given a context. Work is still going on. There are still lots of ‘ mysteries’ about the pyramids but we have lotS of solid interlocking evidence that explains most but not all of them. Yet there are still people who think they were built 12,000 years ago, were linked to Peru and even Mars.Again the Anti- Kythera mechanism. Vast amounts still to learn from another unique survival and an example of the Greeks being far more advanced that we ever expected them to be. But, of  course, we recognise that what we have now is not what was originally made and the Shroud must be assumed to be the same unless it was miraculously preserved outside the real world of physical change.So you can see why we are in tHe same place as tHe pyramids were in the 1880s.And haunting though the photographic negatives of the negatives are( as photographic negatives often are) ,you still have to explain why the squiggles of blood on the head are almost identical to those on the Holkham Bible of 1330  (‘remarkably so’ says Paul Lay, History Today Editor when we were looking at them together when he was interviewing me for my podcast).And crucially you have to explain why Christ’s head is that of a man standing upright with his hair falling to his shoulder- in fact the conventional pose from as early as 300 AD in Rome  but why copied here and not adjusted to show a man lying down. That is one of the mysteries still to be solved- or perhaps the artist was just going through the motions for a commission for a church that needed a new grave cloth in a hurry. We shall never know but this should not stop us bringing in independent experts as I have long advocated.","date":"January 16, 2015 at 2:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/15/there-is-another-reason-charles-freeman-is-wrong/","cat":"image_theory","title":"There is another reason Charles Freeman is wrong"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Quote from Karl Young, The Drama of the Medieval Church, Oxford, 1933, pp. 134-5.

Dan ends his post by saying that the ‘ watertight evidence ‘ might not be  what I hoped for. I have read this blog for some time and no one has come up with any satisfactory explanation for the images – certainly none that anyone outside the Shroud community would accept,There is,I believe, a fundamental problem in assuming, by Colin and STURP and many others, that the Shroud is now as it was when it was made whether in the fourteenth century or earlier. This is extraordinarily unlikely unless the Shroud had been sealed in an Egyptian tomb. In fact, we know it has been exposed in the open air many many times. Fanti has got as far as accepting that linen degrades over time( although he has the bizarre idea that it degrades at a common rate- does a linen stored in a container really degrade at the same rate as one left out in the rain?) Yet Fanti and others, including Colin, never imagine that images in that linen will also degrade over time. Until this is recognised Shroud studies are in limbo.One you look for alternative examples of images on linen, you find that painted images on linen were very common- thousands are recorded in inventories ,etc.yet the attrition rate of the images was very high especially if the linen is folded and unfolded. This is why most painted linens were thrown away after they had fulfilled an immediate purpose. The question remains whether a painted linen, sealed and painted according to the medieval treatises, left any discolouration of the linen just below where the sealant was, and thus only on the top fibres of the linenResearch on painted linens is comparatively recent as so few have survived but scanners are now able to analyse gessoes, pigments, repaintings, far beyond anything possible in 1978. At this point I have to hand over to conservationists who deal with these linens to see how far the Shroud fits as a once painted linen. I think it is promising and that with further research the Shroud will actually seem quite typical of the fourteenth century and while very rare of its type, not that much of a mystery at all. The iconography, with the pattern of bloodstains and the scourge marks both front and back, is certainly very typical of the fourteenth century. The Holkham Bible illustrations are helpful here.So we shall see but it certainly will not be a historian but linen conservationists who will provide the solution, one way or the other.

So it is something that any conservationist working on a decayed painted linen will examine at the start if they are wanting to work on restoration of the original as it was painted e.g. They will try and reproduce the fluidity of the original paint solution on areas that have faded.It is obvious really that a very fluid solution will dry without any evIdence of direction so I don’t see why it is such an issue ( or perhaps I do have some idea!) It certainly is not for those who have taken the bother to consult introductory books on painting on medieval textiles before they declare themselves authorities on whether there is painting on the Shroud or not.","date":"November 12, 2014 at 3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/why-the-images-and-bloodstains-were-not-painted-on/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Why the images and bloodstains were not painted on"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am not really  in here as I have too much on and am not worried if I cannot convince anyone of the paintings when other people I am talking to think it is quite obvious, if only from looking at the depictions in Beldon Scott. I also don’t think anyone will miss me and if I haven’t made my points by now I never shall.However, one of the books I have found most useful is edited by the late Caroline Villiers on medieval paintings on textiles. There are lots of essays on different paintings and it depends entirely on the fluidity of the paint whether there are visible brush stokes or not. If the paint is fluid then ,of course, it settles  without brush marks, just as, to take an extreme example, water settles without marks on the surface. If, it is thicker however, the pigments will dry with the brush stokes intact . They give examples of both in the book from medieval textiles. So the directionless can simply mean that the paint was applied in a fairly fluid form. I would assume that Colin is reading all these books before he gets carried away with his own esoteric solutions . It really does seem that he hasn’t mastered the basics of medieval painting on linen yet but it might be wise to do so so that  someone somewhere might take him seriously!","date":"November 12, 2014 at 3:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/why-the-images-and-bloodstains-were-not-painted-on/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Why the images and bloodstains were not painted on"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"David, How can you be so sure that a year working with experts in weaving , art iconography, medieval linen painting, etc, won’t bring the academic world closer to the truth about the Shroud?Suppose STURP’s dated 1978 tests are redone ( even though there is no evidence that the tapes have been preserved as an archive anywhere) and one does confirm that the calcium carbonate is not dust but gesso and thus evidence of painting?Suppose you get a group of experts in ancient weaving and they show physically that the Shroud could not have been woven on any known ancient loom but could be on a medieval treadle loom that was  only known in Europe since 1000, how would you, with perhaps no experience of weaving at all, actually challenge this?

So we have a start there.But my evidence comes from looking at the earlier depictions and descriptions and tying them into medieval iconography. This is all In my article so I will not repeat it. It adds up to me clearly that this is a linen that was originally painted in the fourteenth century. Every time I read of some other explanation of how the images got there, I feel more confirmed in my view. At least, after all these years of debate, if there was a consensus on how the images were formed other than through being  painted on, we might be able to have a proper debate. I don’ think anyone here is going to convince anyone in the outside world that it was not originally painted unless they can provide a clear alternative.But Louis may be in luck. I was contacted on Monday by a TV producer who is hoping to recreate the Shroud from the weave onwards. The project seems to have been under way before he came across my article and he has started with contacting weaving experts- it turned out that one of those I consulted myself had been contacted independently by him. And then they are going to paint the surface although I warned him that it was unlikely that there are many people around who can recreate a thin layer of gesso on to which the paint goes. It was apparently a highly skilled job with some craftsmen doing nothing else. Very difficult to keep it really thin but sealing the whole surface. He has the outlines of the images and the scourge marks and the bloodstains sorted out so he has clearly been doing his homework.I have no idea whether I shall be involved in this or not – he just asked me some quartos about my article and went on his way – so perhaps we will all wait and see in about a year’s time what comes out of this project.","date":"November 13, 2014 at 3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/why-the-images-and-bloodstains-were-not-painted-on/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Why the images and bloodstains were not painted on"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Sorry , typos.

It could produce thin cloths, linen or wool or silk, up to 25 metres – the details are there. It came from China via Islam – probably the Shroud of Cadouin and the Veil of Apt were woven on treadle looms c. 1090 in Egypt. You can get the dimensions of fine medieval linen from making estimates from the table and altar cloths that were in linen and are known from many depictions. if they have figures with them you can work out the dimensions.  There were also linen dossals and frontal pieces, which went behind and in front of altars, that tend to be rectangular.I am not relating this to the Shroud in any way but when I had a conversation with someone who recreates ancient weaving patterns, they said I had to master the different kinds of loom used in the ancient world before I could say anything of any value as different lengths, widths, and patterns were made by different kinds of looms.So perhaps your researches should concentrate on what type of ancient loom would have been needed to create a cloth the size of the TS.

They took vital evidence in their samples from the Shroud, vital above all because these samples were taken from a number of different areas of the cloth. Ideally they should have been returned to Turin after analysis so that they remained there for future research. If not they should have been kept as an archive in museum conditions with controlled access for scholars  but never dispersed as they appear to have been. I have shown one or two  ‘expert’ friends parts of STURP reports and have been told that some of the problems of the Shroud reported by STURP could be quickly resolved by a 2014  lab.It is not difficult to relate the Shroud to the various ancient and medieval looms of which we have evidence. Some,for instance, would not have been able to weave a cloth of this length but as STURP had no ancient textile expert in their team this was never considered.Again there was no expert on medieval linen painting and the STURP physics and chemistry report specifically says that this area was not considered. Whether there are brush strokes on  a printed linen depends on how liquid the paint mix was when applied, the more liquid the more likely it would settle without marks before it dried. In fact, conservation labs learn about the paint on a linen by seeing whether there are brush marks or not and from this they understand the formulation of the original mix. So absence of brush marks does not mean that the linen was not originally painted ( but, of course, it does not mean that it was!) -again an expert would have known this.So let’s give STURP credit where it is due but note that science does not stand still and reports from 1978 have diminishing value. The team missed a lot of opportunities by not having a full range of experts in weaving and painted  medieval linens. These do exist and could well provide valuable comparative material. Again one cannot give STURP many good marks if they have not preserved their valuable samples intact and together somewhere so that more sophisticated technology can be applied to them.

I have worked intensively on relic cults and I think that the number of people, especially in a Europe where we have grown up with such things, who believe that the Shroud is authentic are very few. The same goes for any other pre-medieval relic although I have a Roman archaeologist friend who confirmed that one of the several Holy Lances is indeed a Roman lance. So ‘saving the masses from a possible delusion’ is not really an issue because very few are deluded ( or not as the case may be) in the first place. The vast majority of those who believe the Shroud is authentic come from other climes.In medieval times, the Shroud was never an important cult (one of the criticisms of it was that John would have mentioned the images on it in his gospel if they had been there on the original), it becomes one when the Savoys take it over and make it such a central theme of their royal prestige. In this sense its heyday was the seventeenth century when it was exhibited to vast crowds almost every year.I like the Shroud as a subject because, despite it not being seen as important in its day, there are lots of issues surrounding the nature of its  weaves, the actual history itself,the iconography of the Shroud and what it might actually have been if not originally a grave cloth. I am just hankering after some proper tests so that I can have more evidence to work from. So my ‘personal’ interest is as a historian who has specialised in relic cults, and sees some unresolved issues here that interest me.

Do you have any thoughts on that.’Even if the Shroud came from Constantinople, which is disputed largely because there is no record of it having done so (the missing years), it was one of many thousands and certainly by no means the most prestigious. One has to remember that in the hierarchy the Cross and the Crown of Thorns ( that ended up in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris) were higher up than the various shrouds that were around.Even if the Schism between east and west had been settled (as was attempted in Florence in 1439) no local church would ever have surrendered up its relics, certainly not the French kings and other potentates who had the best ones! This is what gave a church or ruler status.I think the real problem that Shroud researchers often have is to think that the Shroud was considered as important before the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when it got a powerful backer in the Savoys. Clement was probably overwhelmed with requests to have relics of all sorts proclaimed  authentic and popes typically hedged their bets according to which  kings or nobles they needed to please. Clement never saw the Shroud, he would have known that it was one of many shrouds, no one could tell where it had come from,and there was the problem of the unrecorded images- so I suspect that he just  wanted to keep things calm!","date":"November 8, 2013 at 8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/08/cementing-over-central-park/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cementing Over Central Park"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘Frankly, Charles, your previous remark about the character of Shroud students being evil really makes me question you bonafides as an impartial skeptic.

This is a pity as if they have been kept in pristine condition and together, new tests would certainly add new information about the Shroud. I once worked on a US led archaeological dig in Turkey. We were allowed to take materials out of the country for testing on condition that they were returned.I wish the same had happened here but clearly the deal was done otherwise and so we have a fragmented Shroud. No one here seems to mind much. (One of my first jobs when working as a ‘slave’ – I suppose ‘intern’ nowadays, in Rome, in 1966 was packing away gold fibulae from Etruscan tombs and I was taught how vital conservation and labelling was because one would never know who might one day want to examine the finds.) Even if I was granted access to the tapes I don’t have the expertise to do any new tests so I just made the enquiry as a matter of interest.I do hope the wrangling about the radiocarbon dating can stop – we have passed the 25th anniversary.

Orville Dahl, surveying the Frei tapes, pointed out that no less than 32 of the 57 pollens could only be deposited by insects – rather than blowing in on the wind as Frei suggested.

De Wesselow said something about it being one of the greatest scientific frauds of all time. That showed he knew very little about the lively history of scientific fraud and sadly he never explained who was being fraudulent (you have the book, i binned mine, so perhaps you know) but he rather lost me there. Meanwhile there are just so many areas of research that people could be getting on with in the archives in the cities of northern France. (Troyes has a lot still to explore.) I keep throwing them in. So Margaret de Charny said that her grandfather Geoffrey got the Shroud as ‘a spoil of war’. Some researchers have followed him to Smyrna but the war that he was actually fighting in the early 1350s when the Shroud is first documented was against the English in northern France. So was the Shroud originally among the loot taken from one of the collections of relics that are documented in northern France  as coming direct from Jerusalem, even ‘the Lord’s Tomb’, in the second half of the first millennium? It is unlikely but these are the leads to be followed up.Following an earlier discussion, if the thread in the Shroud is Z spun then it is unlikely (stress unlikely) to have been made in Palestine. So who, among those who think it is first century, is going to do the work on early first century trade within the Roman empire that might pinpoint its origins. There’s tons of new shipwreck evidence for trade.

He brings in a lot of supporting material from his own archival work and certainly there seems enough evidence to suggest that his interpretation is anything but ‘forced’. It is not me who wants to believe that Isaiah 1.6 is a premonition of the Passion. As Marrow shows this was a specifically fourteenth century interpretation of that verse and he gives archival and iconographical evidence in support.)No, I am looking at the Shroud itself. Barbara Faccini’s interpretation of the marks of the flagellation claims that ALL the marks on the Shroud are the direct result of three specific instruments. If she is right (and perhaps she is not), then any representation of the flagellation must show Jesus bound in such a way that the flagellation can mirror the marks on the Shroud in that the instruments used must reach front and back. If you click in to the posting you find a flagellation image where this would have been impossible so it is perhaps by someone who has not absorbed how the flagellation would have taken place if the Shroud is authentic.There is no need to illustrate the flagellation but if you do, and believe in the authenticity of the Shroud, then you have to show how the scourge marks or whatever on the Shroud, were possible.","date":"February 26, 2015 at 1:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/25/cnn-is-laying-it-on-thick/","cat":"other_sites","title":"CNN is Laying It On Thick"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Did Donna Campbell find any cotton threads?","date":"February 27, 2015 at 7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/26/cognitive-response-to-thermochimica-acta-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Cognitive Response to Thermochimica Acta Paper"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"There is no point messing about with threads and fibres whose origins cannot be checked.

So unless you are accusing Oxford, Tucson and Zurich of deliberately concealing the cotton they must have been able to see…….Raes only mentions ‘ traces of cotton fibres’ and  leaves it open how far these spread. With the massive increase in imports of raw cotton to Europe after 1200 and the custom of spinning and weaving both in the same room (and sometimes as in fustians alternating cotton and linen threads) it is hardly surprising to find ‘traces of cotton fibres’ in the Shroud established within the cloth during the spinning and weaving process. But this is just what Raes suggested.As different skeins of yarn were used in the weaving of the  Shroud as the banding shows, some may have been in environments where cotton fibres were drifting around and others not. I think without having any of my sources at hand that Raes thought the fibres may have been left in the loom from an earlier cotton weave.

So if, as yet, we have no scientific explanation for the images on the Shroud , Kelly can keep open the possibility that they are the result of some miracle.Hard-nosed Brits like myself, living in a country that simply gathered up all relics and burned them in the 1530s, take another approach – we don’t understand ‘x’ but there are lots of things we didn’t understand in the past, we do understand now as a result of scientific developments, so why not the Shroud?This does not mean that relic cults, the way they arise and grow and why some become worldwide phenomena and others disappear is not a fascinating topic- at least fascinating enough for me to have spent many months researching and writing about it. I repeat that I am delighted that the Shroud has been behaving like a good medieval relic should and transferred itself onto a copy that has now achieved veneration in its own right with a storyline that seems to have been boosted further by Fred Zugibe.

Unhappy as I am with the Edessa theory which has been around for many years without finding a single specialist in this period of Byzantine history/ Byzantine relics to support it, I am simply interested in alternatives that may have more to back them and be in general more plausible. As the Shroud of Compiegne, also in northern France, showed, once a relic was in the possession of a church, in this case since 876, it tended to be looked after and this is a crucial point with linen that is so vulnerable to damp. The survival of a linen cloth over two thousand years has always been a a crucial difficulty (if not always acknowledged as such) for those who think it authentic and so one must look for places where it may have been safely stored( I am not convinced AT ALL by that gateway in Edessa as a dry storage space!).Northern France was rich in relics including those of the Passion. One thing that amazes me is that we are constantly told that the Shroud is the most researched artefact in history and I, admittedly not from wide reading, have never seen a single account that discusses this possibility that it was among the relics that came directly from the Holy Land to northern France hundreds of years before the Crusades. Again, as I have said earlier, I have never seen a single account that suggests that de Charny may have won it as ‘a spoil of war’ in the wars with the English that took up the last years of his life and fit exactly with the dates of first account of the Shroud in his possession.I doubt whether we would be able to confirm any of this but it stares me in the face as many times more likely that the Edessa route.Perhaps Hugh can use his editorship to put together some of these alternative routes (another is the influx of relics to the Blachernae chapel in Constantinople in the fifth century directly from Jerusalem when Jerusalem was still part of the Byzantine empire- we all know what was seen in that chapel by Robert de Clari eight centuries later and it would have been kept safe from damp here as well!).","date":"January 9, 2014 at 11:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/07/keep-it-simple-can-anyone-help/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Keep it Simple: Can Anyone Help?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am not sure what Willard Libby had to do with the 1988 testing as he died in 1980- perhaps an intervention disputing the findings from on high.Anyway good news that the archbishop seems open to new testing- there are lots of respected conservation labs able to do it.","date":"April 13, 2015 at 4:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/13/more-testing-maybe/","cat":"science","title":"More Testing?

So we have no STURP report on the weave,for instance placing it alongside other linen weaves that are known from earlier periods. We know a lot about the contexts in which the Shroud was stored and displayed since 1350 and there needed to be a report on how this might have affected/ damaged the images -one can hardly expect there have to be no effect over this length of time.  So a historian needed to list everything that is known about the expositions – many took place in the open air  and would not be cancelled if it rained on the Shroud’s feast day 4th May when huge unmanagable crowds had gathered in Turin.As a result the STURP reports cannot be considered to be definitive- they simply leave too many gaps. Again, while the STURP team said that it wanted to be non-invasive of the Shroud ,etc, there is no record of them having a textile conservationist on hand in Turin to advise them on this as they went about their work. I am not an expert but have worked with archaeologists on ancient materials  and I squirmed when reading Heller’s account of the STURP assault on the Shroud.Rogers and Schwalbe’s Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud acknowledged the gap. They state ‘Eastlake [author of a classic nineteenth century study of Italian painting] noted that tempera and watercolor paintings on linen were common in England and Germany in the 14th century. Unfortunately, we have not examined any of these and have no basis for comparison with the Shroud image. Our conclusions are based mainly in direct observations and the results of other follow-up studies.’  Quite so.

To give a small instance, comparison of surfaces of these paintings show that whether brush strokes are visible today or not depends on the liquidity of the paint and if you can’t see any strokes  it simply means that the paint was more liquid when applied. I won’t go further other that to reiterate my point that there are large areas of research on the Shroud that STURP neglected to undertake.‘I don’t mean to puff them up, but future generations will read about Barrie Schwartz and the STURP team if they ever study religion.’ Maybe in the filed of religion- Il leave it to scientists to comment on whether they will be similarly revered by scientists.

You should read Young on it. He had documented evidence for it in four hundred churches and monasteries mostly in Germany.

The liturgy describes Peter and John, dressed as priests, going into the tomb, taking out the clothes and holding them in extenso in front of the tomb before processing up to the main altar where the cloth is laid before the Easter Mass begins. The Lirey Badge appears to show just this, two clergy, the Shroud in extenso , the empty tomb. So can you provide a better explanation?As Young makes clear, see my earlier quote, there were lots of these cloths around. So mine is a reasonable hypothesis.As suggested earlier, the Shroud seems to have been made for a larger audience and altar than seems to have been the case at Lirey. Yet Clement seems to have known of some event associated with the Shroud that made it worthy of an indulgence even though he was certain it was not authentic. These cases usually involve a miracle or two.It is possible that Geoffrey’s grand daughter was right that it was a spoil of war and taken from a larger  church where G. was fighting the English but the Lirey Pilgrim Badge suggests that its original purpose had not been forgotten.

Whether the artist used a template to copy from ( this would explain how similar the Shroud bloodstains are to those, for instance,  of the Holkham Bible and the Roettgen Pieta, both fourteenth century) or whether he did his own thing, he had to produce a negative image to make the point that this was a grave cloth.

I simply mention his findings .The best evidence for the painting comes from the calcium carbonate that was an ingredient of gesso which was used to seal a cloth ON THE OUTER FIBRILS only before painting. That was a STURP finding- the problem being that they did not know anything about medieval painting. I do not regard it as definitive but it is hard to understand why there was so much calcium carbonate and why the image was just on the outer fibrils but this was just where the medieval experts advised it should be and applied by a knife so that any excess could be scraped off (this explains why there were no brushmarks). The other issue is the much more distinct images and the presence of features such as the Crown of Thorns that are now vanished- where have they gone if they were not originally painted on and now disintegrated?The carbon 14 dating has not been discredited. The careful work of Flury-Lemberg as well as every other expert who has actually examined the cloth close up confirms that there was no reweaving -it simply could not be concealed on the back even if it was on the front-  and this is further confirmed by John Jackson’s photography that shows the bands were not  interrupted. Jackson himself confirmed that there was no reweaving and he is normally trusted among the Shroudies. Then no one has been able to even say what the contamination that would have to be twice the weight of the cloth AFTER cleaning to affect the result actually was.An examination under modern microscopy , that is, as my article says, desperately needed -would show whether the paintings or lack of it is ‘a scientific fact ;or not.

I don’t  think the Shroud is ‘so expensive’ – just look at the linen table cloths they were producing  in the medieval period that are of far higher quality. The medieval treatises on painting on linen stress that the weave has got to be fairly close or else the gesso surface cannot be applied. You are aiming to get a very thin and consistent layer of gesso on the outer fibrils without it seeping through a loose weave (then you paint on top). There were two aims- 1) to allow you, if not in the case of the Shroud, to have different paintings on  each side 2) for flags and banners to be able to flutter in the breeze. It was quite a skilled job to get the gesso on in a thin layer and that is why they advised to do it with a knife so excess could be scraped off.Also a treadle loom is three times as fast as an ancient loom thanks to the coordination of feet and hands so this made the whole process of weaving linen and other textiles much easier after c. 1000. Unfortunately the cost of securing illustration rights for the world wide web were prohibitive but I have a nice picture of a medieval treadle loom in the print version of HT. It shows how the weave was rolled up around a rod at the top so that longer cloths could be produced, but the width was limited to c. 130 cms, No problems, the experts tell me, in producing the Shroud on such a loom.","date":"October 29, 2014 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/28/posting-correction/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Posting Correction"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Well, the professional academics I work with are professionals and they would never go public with something that they could not defend with their own expertise.

We also know that the gesso for a painted linen was placed only on the outer fibrils of the cloth and that, north of the Alps, calcium carbonate was used in the gesso mix. We must be grateful to STURP as, although they admit they never examined any painted linens, they did report both the outer image and the calcium carbonate ( in ‘large’  quantities and spread across the cloth). A good start.Then you have to explain away features that different artists over 150 years saw on the Shroud that are no longer there, of which the Crown of Thorns is perhaps the most important with the same pattern of thorns clearly shown in different pictures and we have a separate description of it by an observer of the Shroud in the early sixteenth century so it is pretty clear it was once there. This forms the core of my lecture and I can show how similar the pattern of bloodstains on the Shroud are to those of early fourteenth century iconography.So was the Crown put on by some form of scorch?A painted cloth, with images decayed, such as is seen in the Zittau Veil linen panels, is the best fit hypothesis. We know that hundreds of thousands of these painted linens once existed (evidence from church inventories) but we don’t know of a single one of Colin’s sweat images which is why he is having to make it up as he goes along ( as he clearly is from one posting to the next) .Best fit hypothesis.

Note the speed which which they decayed- I think that the Shroud did well to hang on to its images as long as it did. Note the ‘experiments with modern replicas” certainly worth following up.From The Hangings About the Hall: An Overview of Textile Wall Hangings in Late Medieval York, 1394-1505 by Gr. Charles Kightly in Medieval Textiles  Issue 28, June 2001.Painted clothsIn York, as throughout England, painted cloths were much the most popular cheap wall hangings from the late medieval period until the mid seventeenth century. The earliest York reference I have found is to a painted dorser belonging to John de Birne, rector of St. Sampson’s, who died in 1394 (C). Their great attraction was that they offered brightly coloured and often figurative wall decoration – much cheaper to paint than either to embroider or to work in tapestry – at a very low cost. The shop stock of the York tailor John Carter (d. 1485 B), for example, included twelve yards of ‘panetyd clothes’ at 2/8d, or only 2_d a yard, while that of the chapman Thomas Gryssop (d. 1446 B) included six whole painted cloths (admittedly ‘old’) at 5/- the lot. Their cheapness, however, was counterbalanced by their lack of durability: experiments with authentically produced modem replicas have shown that they degrade quite rapidly, especially when the painted surface is cracked or damaged by rolling or folding for storage. For this reason their second-hand value could be very low indeed. The most expensive York example was Richard Dalton’s (1505 B) complete painted hallings at 7/-, but their average second-hand value seems to have been only one or two pence a yard, and two whole cloths belonging to Henry Thorlthorp, vicar choral (d. 1427 B) were appraised at only a penny each.The low value and ephemeral nature of painted cloths has ensured a very low survival rate, and no indisputably medieval English examples are known to exist. What did they show?Among the earliest described belonged to Robert  Lyndesay (d. 1397 B), parish clerk of All Saints North Street, which depicted ‘the image of Christ sitting in the clouds’. John Underwode, clerk of the vestry at York Minster (d. 1408 A), had a cloth ‘of the Last Resurrection’, Henry Thorlthorp (d. 1427 B) and John Danby (d. 1485 A), vicars choral, both had cloths ‘with the Crucifix’; and cloths ‘with the Trinity’ are recorded for the goldsmith John Colan (d. 1490 B); the widow of Thomas Person (d. 1496 A), and John Clerk, chaplain of St Mary Magdalen chapel (d. 1451 B), whose hanging also depicted St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist. These two saints also appeared on a cloth belonging to John Tidman, chaplain at All Saints, North Street (d. 1458 C), who likewise owned painted hangings with ‘a great image of the Virgin’ and with ‘the history of the Five Joys of the Virgin’. Agnes del Wod (d. 1429 A) favoured images of St. Peter and St. Paul; William de Burton, vicar of St. Mary Bishophill (d. 1414 A) had a cloth with ‘the history of St. Thomas of Canterbury’; and John Colan (d. 1490 B) one with ‘the Virgin Mary and St. George’; while both John Kexby, Chancellor of York Minster (d. 1452 B) and Janet Candell (d. 1479 C) owned cloths depicting ‘the Seven Works of Mercy’. Secular subjects were seemingly much rarer, though the vicar of Acomb, Henry Lythe (d. 1480 A) had a ‘halling painted of Robyn Hude’.","date":"November 25, 2014 at 11:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"One has to remember that if one of the grave cloths for the Quem Queritis ceremony decayed or was destroyed, they would have to commission a new one for the following year.

One also has to explain the descriptions and depictions of the Crown of Thorns that was certainly not a sweat imprint. I am so confused about what Colin is arguing but presumably his sweat would only have created the outline of the body and not extras such as the Crown of Thorns.I am not sure whether anyone has done any work on whether the copies themselves have faded over the centuries. We must remember that we are dealing with at least seven hundred years and very vulnerable materials. The vast majority of linens recorded in church and monastery inventories with images on them have vanished without trace and this can only mean that they proved all too vulnerable to damp, decay orfire.

In the case of the latter they go into the tomb as per the gospel accounts and find the discarded grave cloths. Often there were two as John’s account but Karl Young quoted many accounts where there is a single linen. The Cambridge UL has a copy of the Young and it has many many accounts of these ceremonies – in fact, though dated,  it was the single most important book in my researches which led to my hypothesis of the Shroud coming from the Quem Queritis ceremonies.The TWO of them, although the still dressed as priests, come out of the tomb then hold up the linen before the congregation in front of the empty tomb to show that Christ had once been there but had now risen leaving the grave  cloths.The linen is then. carried to the High Altar and laid there. For a possible illustration of this which fits the liturgical account ,see the Lirey  Pilgrim Badge. Young has a ninth century illustration from the monastery of St.Gall with the Three Mary’s approaching the tomb and you can see the wrapped grave cloths inside. As per the required ritual the Marys in this illustration also carry an incense burner. Well, you go into a dark tomb to find the cloths to bring them out and some incense just gets spilt onto the cloth . . . . .

The Three Marys are approaching the tomb. Inside you can see two cloths wrapped up. We would be extraordinarily lucky to have an actual illustration of these cloths with images on them.Karl Young notes that, while in actual depictions of the grave clothes the sudarium (‘facecloth’) and the linteamina (the wrappings of the body) are usually shown separately (as in the tenth century St. Gall illustration) , ‘the dramatic ceremonies at the sepulchre followed the Gospel traditions with considerable freedom, using sometimes a single [N.B.] cloth called sindo or linteum , sometimes a cloth called sudarium, sometimes several pieces called linteamina, and again both a sudarium and linteamina.’ You really have to work through Young in detail on this as he very carefully traces the developments of these ceremonies from the tenth century in the west. He notes how the Quem Queritis ceremony began as part of the Easter morning Mass but was then separated out to become a  independent ceremony  at dawn with more and more emphasis on the display of the linen grave cloth-or cloths. Although I don’t think he made this point, this emphasis on public display of relics  was very much a feature of the Gothic period which is why Gothic churches had more windows and processional space.While an Easter connection with the Shroud seems to have been maintained in the first half of the fifteenth century on the banks of the river Doubs- it was only exhibited there on Easter Sunday so far as we know – the Savoys converted it into their family prestige relic  and the link with Easter was broken with a new feast day of 4th May. Beldon Scott, has the best account that I know of of the crucial transformation of the Shroud from a rejected outsider  (rejected again by the bishop of Liege in 1449) to a prestige relic with stories of its own miracles and a transfer, not from the Lirey church, but to the kings of Cyprus by Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem in 1087 (Beldon Scott, ‘King of Kings, King of Cyprus’,pp 31-7).  By doing this the Savoys were doing what you had to do if anyone was to take your relic seriously- have a miracle record and a story which in this case needs to go back to Jerusalem. Of course, the researches of Chevalier exploded this Savoy myth of the Shroud having come direct to them from Jerusalem via the Lusignon kings of Cyprus but how else could the Savoys maintain the pretence of authenticity? They must have realised that the Lirey origin would get them nowhere so they dumped it!! Yet, as Beldon Scott shows they could hardly dump Margaret de Charny who actually handed the Shroud over so they created a story that Margaret de Charny was descended from the kings of Jerusalem; fled from Cyprus with the Shroud at the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1453), and handed it over to the duchess Anne of Savoy who was her Lusignon family relative.Mario is right- it is very difficult to get the truth from medieval documents. Yet I think that there is sufficient overlapping evidence to show that some of the cloths used at the Visitatio Sepluchri ceremony (see Young again as how this emerged as an alternative to the ceremony with the Three Marys) had images on them. I cannot think how these images would have been created other than through the well-tested if usually rather ephemeral methods of painting on the cloth.Just as I cannot see the Shroud anywhere in the Pray Codex, i cannot possibly see how the Besancon Shroud is a copy of the Turin Shroud. Remember you have lots of other models to work from if you want to represent a laid out body with folded arms on a cloth , the epitaphioi, the Holy Graves of the Rhineland, the Klosterneuberg altar, etc. etc..  The Besancon image is even cruder than that of the Shroud which in itself does not even have matching bodies. That is why I think that the original artist was concerned ,in the dim morning light, to create something with impact- hence the heavy emphasis on the blood, so typical of the fourteenth and fifteenth century, and so remarked on by everyone who saw the Shroud in its early years. No one would bother much if the Shroud bodies were of different lengths and the arms at the back could not possibly have been the same arms folded at the front. After all Christ had risen- only the grave cloths where his body had lain were left and by displaying them you made the point. Bring the cloth to the altar lay it out ( the length of the Shroud matches an altar such as the one in Cologne Cathedral) and rejoice!!","date":"December 23, 2015 at 12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Mario. I am very busy and jet lagged but here are the references. I cannot guarantee to return to this site so I hope this settles outstanding matters.One.To the Image of Edessa being the subject of veneration. ‘The rituals of the feast of the cloth image in Edessa  are described retrospectively by a writer apparently a court theologian, from Byzantium, ….. The relic, concealed behind a white or purple cover, was usually kept in a shrine and was set up on a ‘throne’ only on special days. On feast days it was approached with water that the people sprinkled on its eyes.’Hans Belting, Likeness and Presence, p.211. There is a great deal more on the Image of Edessa in Belting. Required reading for all those who persist in seeing it as the Shroud of Turin!Two. References to Easter ceremonial cloths being painted. (N.B. The only way to get an image on a linen cloth is to embroider it ( as in the famous Bayeux Tapestry) or paint it after the linen has been sealed. Painting was obviously the most economical way but shelf lives tended to be short unless it was expertly done or the image was preserved on a backing. Otherwise the painted surface tended to disintegrate after too many foldings. This is why we have so few survivors from the many thousands of painted cloth images that are recorded in inventories.)I am sure that much more can be done on this, but this is just the preliminary results of my researches which show clearly that there were painted cloths, with images on them, used at the Easter ceremonies.a)The Mozarabic Rites that originate in the seventh century and are followed in some parts of Spain to this day. The Easter Preface reads: ‘Peter ran with John to the tomb and saw the recent imprints of the dead and risen man on the linens.’ This would date well before the Shroud was created. As no ‘imprints’ are mentioned in the gospels, it would seem that there may have been actual cloths with a double image on them.b)Karl Young is the crucial source here. In the ceremonies of the Visitatio Sepulchri in which John and Peter appear and display  (the Latin word ostendo with its connotations of ‘stretching out’ is used) cloths that have an ‘Imago Domini’, ‘an image of the Lord’, on them. Among the places where this is recorded, in examples given by Young, are Aquileia, Salzburg, Chiemsee (a nunnery on this Bavarian lake), Passau, and the abbey of St. Florian (near Linz). None of these provide details of the images but this simply confirms that there were images on the cloth and that these were shown to the congregation, in this case by clergy representing Peter and John (?as shown in the Musée de Cluny Lirey Pilgrim Badge).c)In her exhaustive study of medieval Easter Sepulchres in England, Pamela Sheingorn finds many references to painted cloths although sadly most inventories or church records do not tell us what the subject of the paintings are. Even so (and I have not been through all her many references to inventories) in the church of St.Peter-in-Cornhill in London, among other ‘steyned clothes’, is one ‘of the burying of our lorde with Image of three Marys’. In his will of 1559, long after the Reformation, Sir Rich Rede bequeathed to St. Paul’s Cathedral ‘my little embodered Cloath wrought with the Resurrection of our Saviour Christe Jesus, which I thinke was made to hang aboute the middest of an Altare, about or beneath in the feast daye of the Resurrection.’ In Lincoln Cathedral, the Easter Sepulchre was embellished with ‘a whyte steyned cloth of damask silke for the sepullcour with ye passion and the Ressurecion of owr lord’.d)In the third volume of the theology section (1790) of the mammoth Encyclopedie Méthodique the Abbé Bergier contributed the article on Suaire (‘Shroud’). He describes the Gospel texts and concludes that the linens or shrouds that one sees ‘in several churches’ could not possibly be the actual burial cloth of Jesus. He goes on to note that in the Easter ceremonies, which he dates back to the 12th and 13th centuries, a linen cloth empreint de la figure de Jesus-Christ enseveli (empreint, ‘printed’, enseveli, ‘buried’) is displayed to the congregation [ in other words he suggests that this was normal practice to have an image of the buried Christ]. He goes on to tell how these cloths are preserved in church treasuries, which is why there are so many of them. He notes specifically those displayed at Cologne, Besançon, Turin and Brioude and argues that despite their lack of authenticity as the original Shroud they should still command veneration.e)A French Bible dictionary of 1912 states that there were ‘linen cloths, in which in former days it was the custom to paint the body of Christ in the tomb and spread them afterwards on the altar to serve for the mass on Easter Sunday.’Further research need on pilgrim badges to see how the Lirey badge relates to others. The question that needs to be researched further is whether there are examples of pilgrim badges that record a miraculous event- was there an (unrecorded) miracle associated with the display of the Shroud one Easter? We do have lots of recorded cases where an object, not seen as a relic as such, became venerated after a miracle or vision was reported. The odd thing about the early accounts of the Shroud is that no miracles are reported (perhaps one reason why the Church authorities were able to dismiss it so easily). The Savoys did, however, produce several miracles- and these are described in Beldon Scott. (I really have no time for those who do not have this book at hand as it is not expensive in second hand copies and has a mass of vital information about the Shroud.)Happy Christmas to all, and especially Dan!

Of course we should be happy with images from either of these ceremonies but I think the latter is more likely as there seems to be more emphasis on the display of the cloth in the recorded liturgies of the Visitatio. The theatrical impact  would have been enormously enhanced if there were images on the displayed cloths.Having spent two and a half years  and more on medieval relic cults, I am used to so many stories ( and miracles ) invented in the hope of getting pilgrims to believe that you had an authentic relic that I dispair of actually finding out what really happened at Lirey. It is always interesting to me that neither of the de Charney males are linked to the claim for authenticity. There is no evidence that the much  in demand Geoffroi senior was ever at Lirey in these years before his death in 1356 and Geoffroi  junior seems to have been happy to exhibit the Shroud with the restrictions Imposed  on him by Clement VII ( that it had to be announced that it was not authentic).The difficulty is intensified by the period. With a third to half the population dead from the Black Death and a highly traumatises surviving population many of whom believed that the Black Death was a punishment from God, people flocked to new shrines. Lirey was clearly a new early 1350s shrine but we have no record of how it might have related to the traumas left by the Black Death. However, we should be sensitive to this context.I am frustrated that Belting did not give a reference for the sprinkling of water on the eyes as he implies that this was a ceremony at Edessa, not Constantinople.Is it clear from the text Mario quoted that this is a cloth and not a wooden icon? Wiping an image on a cloth with water does not seem a sensible thing to do if you were interesting in preserving the image or the cloth which would decay if damp. It would seem, unless there is a clear reference to this being a cloth, that we are talking of a wooden icon. Having said that , Belting’s alternative scenario of pilgrims sprinkling water on the open( we presume) eyes of the Edessa image also seems to be sure way to have a decayed cloth!","date":"December 23, 2015 at 1:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S.

Karl Young, the great authority on the Quem Queritis ceremonies, claimed that there were no less than 400 documented examples but the grave cloths actually shown to the congregation on Easter morning varied from church to church. Young noted that, while in the descriptions of the grave clothes the sudarium (‘facecloth’) and the linteamina (the wrappings of the body) are usually shown separately, ‘the dramatic ceremonies at the sepulchre followed the Gospel traditions with considerable freedom, using sometimes a single cloth called sindo or linteum, sometimes a cloth called sudarium, sometimes several pieces called linteamina, and again both a sudarium and linteamina.’ (Karl Young, the Drama of the Medieval Church, Oxford , 1933, pp.134-5.)Some of them had images. So when I read of all these controversies about which ‘Shroud’ is which my first response is that we are probably talking of independently produced grave cloths of all shapes and sizes. As I said in an earlier posting, because painted linens had the image only on the outer fibrils of the cloth (thanks STURP), they were very vulnerable to disintegration which is why we have so few painted linens left today.it was the folding and unfolding that did for them and the survivors today are mostly ones that were pasted onto a backing board.We must distinguish between linen ( it had to be linen to fit in with the gospel accounts) cloths produced specifically for the Quem Queritis ceremonies and those cloths/wrappings/facecloths  believed to be authentic shrouds. In medieval Europe the top earner was probably the Shroud at Cadouin as this had been brought back from the Holy Land and assumed to be the real thing- we now know that it was produced in the workshop of the caliphate.","date":"December 2, 2014 at 5:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am sure everyone knows that Thiede’s datings are controversial.

It leaves a shadowy image with large parts of the original missing completely. in the Shroud we just have the shadowy images of what was once a a painted linen.The Veil is similar to the Shroud in many ways. It is made up of sections of 108to 116 cms wide- as the conservators say this is what one expects from a medieval loom. ( No need to get into Assyrian cubits.) The paint does not penetrate the fibres and they show from the remains of animal proteins that there was a size or sealing Gesso applied to the outside fibrils only as it also was for the Shroud ( thanks STURP). The only paint that got through the gesso was red madder – not sure why this got through while other pigments did not but presumably the liquid was more fluid and less made up of pigments than the rest of the paint.And it is also noted how the artist used shadings to give the impression of three dimensions.So what we have it evidence of how a linen was painted and how it looked ( the Visitation panel is the one I use in lectures) when the pigments come off leaving a, dare I say it, Shroud like image behind.So a quick glance and immediate rejection of the relevance of the Zittau Veil is a totally inadequate response.

So an image on the outer fibrils only is an indication of gesso having  been applied – if there had not been a gesso barrier the image would have gone through into the cloth.The next indication of gesso was the ‘large’ quantities of calcium carbonate found by STURP that appear to have covered the whole surface of the Shroud. Calcium carbonate or sulphate was used in the gesso and is still used today if you look up modern gesso products.Another  indication of gesso is animal proteins as the calcium was usually mixed with a glue – often of rabbit skin boiled up – again you can find instructions even today of how to make your own ( first skin your rabbit!). While Mike Spyer who advised me on this could find no evidence at all of human blood in the accounts, he did suggest that the STURP findings were compatible with animal proteins.So I am working on the assumption that, together with the evidence from the Zittau Veil, we have good evidence that the Shroud originally had a gessoed surface. I completely agree that we need to move on from there to look at the specific way that the images were then created and  see how far these are different from what might have been expected. Unfortunately the full report on the Zittau Veil is in German and I only have the summary . It is interesting that the width of the sections that make up the  Shroud, that the article says is related to the width of a medieval loom, is very similar to the width of the Shroud.So as I have said many times before ,there is still a lot to research of the Shroud but as there is no scientific evidence of a first century date and the preservation of a linen from that period, other than in the very specific conditions of closed Egyptian tombs, is unknown, for me everything comes together to show a medieval context within which we must find the meaning of the Shroud.I think that is a perfectly reasonable stance to take and there is a lot of evidence that I provide in my article that offers further support to this.","date":"December 7, 2014 at 4:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Hugh.

We had to ask for permission to use it in my article and at first no one at Besancon knew where it was and sent us an illustration from a seventeenth century book they had with it in it. Then they announced they had found the original and sent the HT picture researcher a big copy of it that we had of course to pay to use. As everyone seeing the Shroud in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries remarked on the prominence of the blood stains, the scourge marks, the Crown of Thorns, then these would surely have been reproduced on a copy – and the head is so very different! It is also, of course, a single image not a double one.It is surely obvious that the same body was not represented on the Shroud of Turin as on the Besancon Shroud, so the theory that they were used consecutively in Jerusalem doesn’t make any sense.My own view, as I put it in my article with backing from a 1790  source, is that this was another of the Quem  Queritis cloths – what is has in common with the Shroud is that the wound is not shown on the conventional right (conventional not from any gospel source but  the medieval iconographic convention) but on the left side of the body as these cloths ( whether you agree with me or not that the Turin Shroud is one of them)  were symbolic representations of the marks Christ might have left on the burial cloth if he had lain on it.","date":"November 28, 2014 at 3:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Can anybody put me on to the scientific evidence that the Shroud dates to before AD 33?","date":"December 5, 2014 at 4:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Colin, I have repeatedly said that we need a  full data base of all the depictions of expositions.

How much more evidence do you need?When I show my lecture, there are  basic seven depictions from 1578 to 1703 I show. I warn the audience that some of these ( not the Tempesta who was resident at the court and must have seen several exposition), were quick drawings and I show the difference between the different depictions. I then go on to suggest features that they share in common. The Crown of Thorns is one of them and is typical of the iconography of the fourteenth century when they began to show the Crown in place after Christ had been removed from the Cross. The thumbs are another- it is interesting that you can see how the angle of the thumbs is the same in 1578 as it was in 1690 and 1703.So this is good evidence but I always go back to the crucial point.

The evidence that the Shroud is a one off in this sense  is simply not there.Where the Shroud is a one-off is that it ( whatever else it has been imagined as being since) appears to be the only survivor of the Quem Queritis ceremony  andtherefore of importance for that reason alone. That is why I was asked to speak to a group trying to raise money to restore a MEDIEVAL church.I think your problem is that  because the Shroud is a line survivor, you think that it was unique in its time when we have references to thousands of other cloths with images on Christ on them.

An obvious place to start.2) When Jerusalem was still part  of the Byzantine empire in the fourth and fifth centuries, the age when relic collecting began, there are documented accounts of the transfer of relics to Constantinople by Pulcheria, the sister of the emperor Theodosius  II, to add to the transfer of Helena’s relics from Jerusalem a century earlier.Both are more obvious trails of provenance than the Ian Wilson hypothesis.

You do not seem to be aware of the serious theological objections to relics on the grounds that they encouraged the worship of objects at the expense of God. One of the greatest of the fourth century theologians , Basil of Caesarea, put it as follows: ‘ As the sun does not need the lamplight, so also the church of the congregation can do without the remains of the martyrs. It is sufficient to venerate the name of Christ, for the Church is his bride, redeemed by his blood.’I assume that you don’t live in Europe but if you are over here, do wander around the sacristies of some medieval Catholic churches – you will hardly believe that there were quite that many saints in existence as you will find parts of in the reliquaries and that is after the church cleaned out so many in the late nineteenth century.","date":"November 26, 2013 at 12:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/21/where-to-begin-first-pour-two-cups-of-coffee-or-a-full-pint-or/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Where to begin?

Pope Innocent III had to insist, in 1215, that bones be given proper reliquaries and it was often said you should not trust a relic as coming from Constantinople unless it had a reliquary with Greek writing on it. Pope Innocent also set up commissions to test whether a miracle was genuine or not – and these commission accounts can be fascinating reading with many miracles thrown out as unsupported by any evidence!My wife is a horse dealer of the rare honest variety and she constantly comes across people who have been mis-sold horses by dealers who are less scrupulous than she is. The world of relics was the same and everyone in the medieval world knew this especially when travel became more easy and people began noticing that this was the third head of John the Baptist (or,dare I say it, the fourth burial shroud of Jesus) they had come across. By the fourteenth century, people are becoming much more sceptical about accepting any relic as necessarily genuine and the debates between popes, bishops, the de Charnys and the Savoys over the Shroud show exactly this!!","date":"November 25, 2013 at 7:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/21/where-to-begin-first-pour-two-cups-of-coffee-or-a-full-pint-or/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Where to begin?

But as a later painting on the earlier figure it may have been the first to have come off . We need a linen conservation expert to help explain why the buttocks today are lighter than the rest- as noted by the art historians  in the 1973-6 examination ( that was suppressed!), one would expect the buttocks to have been darker if an actual body had laid on the cloth ( and the back view to show a heavier imprint than the top).‘Not a shred of paint’ MacCrone anyone?The lithograph that Beldon Scott shows on p.296 suggests that the painting of the front figure had largely faded by 1868. Did the rest come off in the next thirty years? The Zittau Veil was used to cover a steam bath by some Russian soldiers- where the steam penetrated in the centre the paint came off, round the edges at the bottom it did not, hence the contrast. Still I take Hugh’s point- we need to get the linen conservationists who have studied painted linens that have deteriorated onto this. The Shroud was kept well past its image date- usually these linens appear to have been thrown away when the painting disintegrated.There is a possibility that the Shroud was repainted before its transfer to Turin in 1578. This fits if you take a chronological sequence of the depictions which the legs apart painted over an earlier painting. I was surprised to find that repainting a treasured linen was actually quite common- modern scanning of some painted linens has shown up different layers from repainting. However, we can get nowhere on this until someone brings together all the known depictions of the Shroud- as it was displayed- not copies. Even modest exploring dug up two ones I had never seen, one lurking in the British Library of 1608 and one sent to me in error by the Royal Library in Turin when I ( or rather the picture researcher) had asked for something different. Once again there is tons to uncover about the Shroud’s history ,especially of how it looked at different moments in its history.This is an unfolding story.On pilgrim badges. The Lirey 3D is actually very conventional.  Brian Spencer has an excellent  section on moulds and metals (pp.7- 13). Mould making was a skilled occupation and ,as I mentioned earlier, the Lirey Badge is crude compared to some of the star finds. Original moulds for pilgrim badges  have even been found- one from Yorkshire is illustrated on p. 9 of Spencer. The metals varied from lead to pewter to gold at the top end of the market. An amazing amount of work has been done on all this and it seems that the Lirey badge is totally typical of mass-produced pilgrim badges from minor (and in this case short-lived) shrines.Repeat-this is an unfolding story. We have not got there yet although I think the evidence of a medieval origin is overwhelming. For me the iconography of the all-over scourge marks both front and back, not known before 1300, is the clincher !

What Heller reports of the Morris paper, the impression is that the calcium is there in good quantities and spread over the whole surface and this is just what you expect if the cloth was coated according to the prescriptions laid down in medieval manuals, such as Cennino Cennini. Cennini as a Tuscan ,would have used calcium sulphate in his gesso, the northerners had access to calcium carbonate in their local mines and used this So don’t you think that the next time the Shroud has a scanner applied to it we should check this out further?? I have also been told that the aragonite found near the feet might actually be part of the original calcium carbonate. As it appears to have been mislaid  we may never know and I certainly know nothing about the relationship between aragonite – which is spread  throughout the Mediterranean – and calcium carbonate so cannot assess this. Any mineralogists able to help here? The calcium fits well with the other evidence of paint and also with the evidence of animal proteins ( the gesso binding) which the professor of physiology I consulted over the Heller Adler  papers thought they had confused with blood. So it is one part of the picture but fits with a lot else including two direct accounts of the Shroud being painted ,1389 and 1449, and references (De Beatis 1517) to being able to see the images from a distance. So I am taking it as number one hypothesis. From what you say you would not even consider it- which suggests something a closed mindThe retting scenario means nothing unless there are comparative examples in linen which should be fairly easy to check out. It gave the impression of being a rather desperate solution picked out of the air especially as flax was often retted in the open air (!). As so often in Shroud research, no one ever seems to think of relating what is found to comparative examples whether pilgrim badges, other formerly painted linens, etc. yet this is almost certainly where the solution to the Shroud’s origins will eventually be found. I may be biased in favour off unfolding research being helpful but this is just how the dating of the horses of St.Mark’s, on which I have written a book ,was settled and fixed conclusively to the second century AD when the previous big study  had said 4th BC. We shall wait and see but it would be so good to have a state of the art scanner look at the surface of the Shroud again.I seem to be on a limb here in that I just assume that developing technology will offer totally new insights into the Shroud as time goes by. Others clearly think we have enough evidence to be certain as to what it is and when it was dated and so we can close the books. I am taking a bet on my solution and will cash in if the Shroud is shown to be a fourteenth centUry painting. I shall have to eat humble pie if science proves that it is not! But the question remains open in the present state of knowledge.","date":"December 12, 2015 at 5:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"John, not necessarily as there  was a great surge of blood cults in thirteenth and fourteenth century Europe and many monasteries/churches claimed to have phials of Christ’s blood .e.g. one was found in the same chest that held the Sudarium of Oviedo and Hailes in England had an enormously lucrative one -they rebuilt a large part of their monastery from the proceeds. Then there was dried blood such as the miracle of Bolsena – a host which bled to show that it was truly the blood of Christ- and the blood was kept on the floor.Where did all this blood come from? The incentive to add some to a relic must have been strong. So when you read the 1449 eye-witness account  of the Shroud by a Benedictine monk, Corneille Zantfliet, in which he describes a shape of the body of Christ that was miro artificio depicta, ‘admirably or skilfully painted’, and goes on to say that the wounds on the hands, feet and side of the images were so bloody that they looked as if they were recent, one does wonder.Still ultimately anyone who has a piece of the Shroud or a sticky tape with blood on it needs to have it tested in an independent forensic lab to test out the blood.

As the  1978 tests have never been replicated we certainly have no proof in the scientific sense that there was blood. Problems such as the lack of potassium and the redness of the ‘blood’ convince many that this is not blood.  I was just making the point that the presence/addition  of human blood in an era where blood cults were everywhere and very lucrative is not beyond the bounds of credibility. Many such things went on in the relic cults!The question of being or not being a Christian is really  irrelevant in relationship to the authenticity of the Shroud. If Jesus lived ,was crucified and was buried, a burial shroud existed at one point. THe question is whether the Shroud is it or not, or if it perished ( as statistically would be the most likely fate) or is one of the many other shroud relics or perhaps is hanging around somewhere totally unrecognised for what it is .Many Catholics do not believe that the Shroud is authentic and the Church despite presiding over the carbon-14 dates is not clear either!","date":"December 12, 2015 at 11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Colin, I have never suggested that I have settled it.

It was one of many such shrines, hundreds of them are recorded, which had a brief moment of popularity but then failed.

In the years to come the canons of Lirey proved that they had the legal right to ownership of the Shroud. It is unfortunate that accounts of the various ecclesiastical courts that found in their favour against the de Charny family have not survived as they would have filled us in on the origins of the Shroud in Lirey.If you research the life of Geoffroy de Charney’s in tHe 1350s to his death in 1356, you find no evidence that he ever visited Lirey as he was completely tied up with the diplomatic and military business of the king as a time of acute warfare in Northern France. I suspect that it was Jeanne de Vergy who actually started putting the  Shroud up as a relic. Unfortunately she was not canny enough to create a back story to give it some claim to authenticity as was  usual in these cases- or if she did it has not been recorded.In her unsuccessful attempts to prove ownership of the Shroud, Margaret de Charny did at one point claim that it was given to her grandfather as a spoil of war.

It was as early as 1343 that the French king, Philippe VI,  granted de Charny permission to raise the money for building by amortizing feudal land. With the money in hand, de Charny then petitioned the papal court at Avignon for the right to have masses said continually for his family and to have a family burial ground near to the church. None of these documents mention a shroud. Lirey was essentially a church in which prayer would be offered for Geoffroy and his family after his death. There are many cases where indeed a church was built specifically to house a relic (usually in a place on an existing pilgrimage route!)  but remote Lirey was not one of these.I suppose it is possible that the de Charny family gave the Shroud to the canons of the church perhaps after pope Clement VII declared that it was not the authentic burial shroud but no surviving document mentions this.  Yet Pierre d’Arcis claiims that the Dean procured the Shroud and this could only have been after the official election of the canons on October 1354. When Margaret’s  second husband , Humbert de Villersevel, removed ‘a cloth, on which is the figure or representation of the Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ’, presumably our Shroud, he promised it would return to the CANONS when peace had returned. But as we know, Margaret grabbed it, tried to fight off the canons when they wanted it back and then passed it on to the Savoys in 1453. The canons eventually gave up but they, not  the de Charny family,  were certainly seen as owners at the beginning of the fifteenth century and, according to Pierre d’Arcis, as early as the 1350s.No problem in ploughing your lonely furrow, Colin, and doing whatever detective work you want but you do need to provide documentation if you are going to be an effective historical detective.

It is common practice to suggest avenues of research that one might not be able to carry out oneself in the hope that someone with the right linguistic skills, professional expertise and time  might pick them up.In many areas, research on the Shroud has hardly begun. Too much time has been spent navel gazing at the Shroud images and virtually nothing on the painted linen possibilities although to be fair it is only in the last fifteen years that serious work has been done on these and scanners are able to show what the original painted surfaces and primers below them were made of. I hope that one day an expert will simply fit the Shroud into the research, just as the horses of St. Mark’s, Venice can now be seen,from work on the gilding of similar statues, to be second or third century AD.Unlike some I am happy to wait for the origin of the Shroud to become clear probably in the next five to ten years. I am keeping a watching brief on work on painted linens and will certainly let everyone know if the Shroud Turns out to be a typical of other ‘once painted now decayed’ linens. The Zittau Veil is the best similar example I know of ( original pigments steamed off leaving images similar to the Shroud on discoloured linen) but no doubt more will come to light and some expert in formerly painted line cloths will be able to make effective comparisons with the Shroud.  I cannot really start retraining as an expert in the conservation of linen so I will have to leave this to the existing experts!

It is a fascinating and absorbing subject and it kept me very busy for three years of research for my book.","date":"December 12, 2015 at 2:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Calcium carbonate.

This was the result of the mass of fake relics that poured into or were created within Europe after the sacking of Constantinople in 1204. Pope Innocent III tightened things up  in a decree of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215: ‘Some people try to sell saintly relics and show them around everywhere. This belittles the Christian religion. To prevent this for the future, we declare by this decree that old relics may not be exhibited outside of a container or exposed for sale. And let no one presume publicly to venerate new ones unless they have been approved by the Roman pontiff.’ This is why Clement VII made his announcement that he was not authorising the Shroud as genuine in 1390 (but did allow veneration).Of course, people took their chances but, as with the Shroud, the local bishop soon suppressed them. It is interesting that when Margaret de Charny tried to exhibit the Shroud as genuine in 1449 in Liege she was asked for the papal authorisation for what she was doing.She could only produce the papers from Clement and so was forbidden to go on exhibiting.Anyone would have known that if they tried to set up a new relic they would be under immediate scrutiny. And so it proved to be. The original shrine seems only to have survived a year or two before it was closed down and the Shroud hidden away.The 1390 proclamation was a typical compromise ( as those of us who live in the EU are very used to). There would have been only one -or two- genuine Shrouds and most of the others had long standing pilgrim income which they would have protected against any pronouncement of yet another ‘authentic’ Shroud.The popes knew better- allowing veneration but not disturbing the old established ‘authentic Shroud’ sites – was the sensible way. No one would have had any means of knowing which of the competing shrouds, if any of them, was genuine anyway.  On what grounds were you able to compete with the Shroud of Compiegne that had five hundred years of veneration behind it? When Antonio de Beatis saw the Shroud in 1517 at Chambery- he was told that it had been taken by a Lord of the House of Savoy from a Muslim prisoner during the First Crusade!

It is not good enough to rely just on the Shroud today without making any assessment as to the ways in which it may have different in the past. If you believe that , unusually, the Shroud is the same now as it was six hundred or even two thousand years ago, the onus is on you to show why it remained impervious to change despite the colourful history, documented from 1350, imagined from before that, that we can recreate. This is why I am trying to involve experts who traditionally have refused to get involved with the Shroud.It is hard to know what expertise Benford and Marino bring to the subject.

Qu.6, that a significant proportion of medieval relics came from the Holy Land. One of the effects of so many people following Ian Wilson is that they have ignored the considerable amount of evidence for the import of relics directly into Europe from the Holy Land. It began, of course, with the transfer of relics from Jerusalem to Constantinople in the fourth and fifth centuries. Then, soon after the Arab Conquests, trade in relics from the Holy Land to Europe began. It is well covered in Chapter Ten of Michael McCormick’s Origins of the European Economy where he looks at a number of french collections from this period. Then vast numbers of relics, both from Constantinople ( 1204) and from the Crusades poured into Europe in the Middle Ages.  Some of these were of Islamic cloth which also traded as an item in itself. Clearly if you were presented with a new relic, evidence that it came from the Holy Land was a selling point which simply encouraged more imports. So far not a single of these traded relics has been shown to be authentic but, whether you believe the Shroud to be authentic or not ,if you are a serious researcher into it, you need to examine the large amount of documentation and evidence of the relics themselves that deal with relics coming from the Holy Land.

Wilson is misleading as he suggests that the word refers to the cloth after Jesus wiped his face on it.. This is not grenade throwing – it is simply commenting on a misleading statement that too many people have relied on without going back to the original text ( that also mentioned burial cloths separate from the tetradiplon cloth- again Wilson does not mention this)..I believe that Jesus existed and that he was buried. Therefore there was originally a burial shroud or wrappings/ facecloth. I just don’t think that the Shroud was it. If a more plausible set of burial clothes from first century Jerusalem comes up it would not shake my world view at all. After all in Jerusalem there exist a number of large stones that originally blocked tombs ( the practice was to unroll them three days after to check that the deceased really was dead or to anoint the body as in the case of the Jesus tomb.). It is highly likely that the stone from the tomb is still there and if the right one was indeed found then it would not destroy my world view either.

Part of the problem is that the Fantis and Carpinteris get flashes of international publicity but their findings are quickly discredited and the Shroud is not seen as a serious object of research.Whenever I do get into  conversation  with an ancient textile specialist, the Shroud is just assumed to be the typical product of a medieval treadle loom ( the length and width are the give aways), so, I am told,  why bother to go further? The late Caroline Villiers, one of the foremost experts on painted linens, simply referred to the Shroud as ‘one of the best-known surviving medieval images on a textile support’. It was not an issue with her and she turned her attention, before her early death, to the painted linens that really interested her.I am learning to live with the fact that the real painted linen experts are tied up with the linens whose paintings do survive and they are less interested in ones where the paint has disintegrated, even when they accept that this is what has happened.","date":"July 12, 2015 at 4:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/the-meaning-of-solid/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Meaning of Solid"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘Yawn’ :exactly what I mean about Shroudies not caring about whether they convince anyone outside their own circle!

You are making the mistake of accepting the Wilson  hypothesis and then trying to explain any objections (of which there are many) to it. Try starting the other way round and say ‘ If the Shroud is authentic and has arrived in Lirey by 1350, then let’s consider the most likely routes through which it may have made its way there.’ (See also ‘Anonymous’ below who is thinking like this so there is at least someone prepared to take things on.) Perhaps one of the more opulent Shroudies could finance someone to do a PhD on the subject- it does need three years concentrated work in the archives from someone who knows the right languages. My own take is that a C14 date will probably come up with a medieval result but I will wait and see. It is also likely that someone who has never studied the Shroud but who is working on one of the other medieval linens that survive, using technology that is way ahead of anything known in 1978 or 1988, comes up with some findings about images on the medieval linens which can be applied to the Shroud.

Northern France was avid for relics and there were large collections, including those of Charlemagne, early on. They were added to by the Crusades. As the Shroud is first documented in northern France, overwhelmingly the most likely  source of its origin lies somewhere within these collections but, as I have said above, I have not the skills or time to do the research that is needed for this. It may have been captured by de Charny in the wars with the English that devastated this area and must have involved the looting of relics from the collections that had been there for centuries.I can only repeat that to stick to the Edessa theory without even mentioning more plausible alternatives for the arrival of the Shroud in northern France is simply bad history. A historian starts,BEFORE researching , going through ALL the possible routes of which, of course, there are many through which relics made their way from Jerusalem to northern France, and picks out the most likely for further research. If I did have the time to do the research, the Edessa theory would be very low down on my list indeed, partly because specialist scholars in Greek texts and Byzantine relic cults have always rejected it. ( Wilson does not even read Byzantine Greek!!) Although it is still not that likely, the most interesting alternative for me would be to chart the well-documented collecting of relics from Jerusalem by Pulcheria, the sister of the emperor Theodosius II, in the early fifth century. The reason for this is that her collection was housed not in the imperial palace but in the Blachaernae church on the outskirts of Constantinople and it was, of course, there that Robert de Clari , saw a shroud with an image that might have been one of her fifth century imports brought directly from Jerusalem. Again, going for the Edessa theory without even mentioning this possibility is bad history. You need to start by listing all the possibilities and then you may well find that the actual truth is concealed from us because the documentation surrounding the early history of the Shroud has been destroyed anyway in the medieval Anglo-French wars in northern France, in the French revolution or in the sacks of Constantinople by the crusaders and Ottomans!

However, I have compiled my personal list of all the known bloods of Christ, bleeding hosts,etc, etc, for the fourteenth century which show that there was a big market in such relics and, although no expert I have consulted who has read Heller and Adler or looked at the Evans photographs of blood thinks that it is blood, the application of human blood to a relic claiming to be authentic was quite common in the fourteenth century  and , if anyone does replicate the tests and shows that there is human blood on the Shroud, this is the first period we should be looking at for its addition.

Having told of the lady who brought roses to be placed by the Shroud,one of which touched it and was then passed back to her,  Heller goes on: ‘Not only this woman but all the clerics and Turinese university personnel who came into contact with the Shroud invested with special meaning the act of touching it with some object- with a handkerchief, a card, or some postage stamps. It was as though they felt that something mystical might be transferred from the cloth to the touched object. Or perhaps it was merely a souvenir.  I would discover later that this was more the rule than the exception’.Touching or kissing a relic  and placing objects on it to absorb the spiritual energy ( such touched objects were known as brandea) was such a normal part of medieval life and continued after the Reformation so attempts to link what has been found on the Shroud with the moment of its creation are fruitless unless the surface material is dated or related directly to the original flax.","date":"November 7, 2015 at 4:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/05/paper-chase-new-paper-on-sem-analysis-of-pollen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  New Paper on SEM Analysis of Pollen"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Totally agree, Daveb.

I think it was the growing numbers of pilgrimages from the thirteenth century onwards that was important as people would come across the fifth thighbone of St.Peter as they travelled from one part of Europe to another and so a gradual scepticism crept in.This was fuelled by rival shrines discrediting each other and appealing to the pope to get their relic authenticated and their rival condemned. The Shroud itself is a good example of a relic that, in the medieval period, never got church approval other than as an object worthy of veneration.By the fifteenth century there was much more widespread scepticism about relics (e.g. the Lollards and Hus, De Sanguine Christi of 1405 , a major attack on blood of Christ cults) and this culminates in the sixteenth century in wonderful satires as in Erasmus’ Pilgrimages for Religion’s Sake of 1526 ( available on line) and then John Calvin’s massive rejection of relics in his Treatise on Relics. These were Christian attacks on relic cults (N.B. those who think that anyone who doubts the authenticity of the Shroud must be an atheist!).Forgeries went on all the time but most were very crude and didn’t take anyone in – see the response to the Pardoner in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales. As I suggested above, many relics were in fact mysterious objects that had originally been made for some other function but which then became associated with a miracle or whatever and so became venerated in their own right -as the pope allowed veneration of the Shroud but only on the condition that it was announced that it was not authentic. Then sometimes the line got crossed and an icon worthy of veneration became seen as an actual original relic.I am only putting forward this  for those Shroudies who say that if the Shroud is not authentic, it must be a cunning and sophisticated forgery.

But there is someone called Kelly Kearse who is making a big thing of it – I don’t know what his qualifications for doing this are as there does not seem any evidence that he has analysed the sample himself. If I was arguing the ‘Shroud is authentic’ case , I would certainly be very cautious about making definitive statements about AB, always a minority grouping, on such poor samples in case they were used against me,  but there you go.Similarly if I was looking at how a first century Jerusalem relic might have got to Europe, I would start with the three most likely routes as there is documentation and evidence from all three.a) The early recorded relic trade between the Holy Land and Europe documented by Michael McCormick in his Origins of the European Economy.b). The documented  transfer of relics from Jerusalem to Constantinople from 330 onwards, including those relics brought in by Pulcheria, the emperor’s sister in the early fifth century. Then transfer to Europe as a result of the massive looting of relics by the Crusadersc) The documented transfer of relics collected in the Holy Land to Europe from the Crusades.When we have so much evidence to explore here, why did Ian Wilson ever dream up the Image of Edessa idea as a means of getting the Shroud to Europe? It has been condemned by every Byzantine scholar who has discussed it and, due to the sheep -like nature of those who have accepted it, has diverted attention from far more relevant areas of research in the early relic trade. However, virtually none of these ‘shroud researchers’ have any background in the period 350 to 1100 which, and I still see myself as an outsider to it, is extraordinarily complex  as a result of poor sources and complex literary conventions in the Greek and Latin texts.So they swallow Wilson and ignore the most likely ways in which an authentic first century relic, if any such exist from a period when relics were not collected anyway, might have reached Europe!!","date":"January 22, 2013 at 12:59 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"A good question as to who is an expert here. I have been surprised by the number of people who describe themselves as ‘shroud researchers’ and list over twenty years experience but who simply seem to reproduce the ideas of others with no original input of their own. So Stephen Jones ( who has accused me of knowing that the Shroud was authentic but casting doubt on its authenticity simply to make money – and for an article for which i was paid nothing!) merely parrots Ian Wilson (Saint Ian of the Holy Shroud) and so far as i can see from his website provides nothing original of his own while seeing off anyone who dares to comment unfavourably on what he has written. No wonder Dan Porter’s blog flourishes while Stephen Jones’ stagnates.My expertise on the Shroud is marginal, as the author of the only full length history of medieval relics on the market (Holy Bones, Holy Dust, Yale UP, 2011), one which has been well received. The two and half years of full time research I have done on medieval relics makes me believe that the Shroud is almost certainly medieval but, as there was once a burial shroud in the tomb of Jesus, there is a tiny, and really tiny, outside chance that it could be it. However, I have also earned my living professionally as a historian for forty years and it was from this ‘expertise’ that I saw the immense weaknesses in Ian Wilson’s work on the Shroud. Is he an expert on the Shroud who,however, fails miserably as a historian? Certainly the real experts on Byzantine history, religion and literature unanimously condemn his argument about the Image of Edessa, so I am in good company. (If it were proved that the Shroud is authentic, it is much more likely that it came to Constantinople with the other relics from Jerusalem that we know arrived in the fourth and fifth centuries- see the wonderful ivory (now in Trier) of the relics of St. Stephen being brought into the city from Jerusalem c. 420.) I would also rate Madame Flury-Lemburg, who is an acknowledged expert on textiles and who has worked closely on the Shroud, when she says there is no reweaving, over Ray Rogers, whose views, never confirmed or replicated by any later research, seem to be based on threads that he claims, without any further authentication, to come from someone who was present, years before, at the cutting up of the Shroud. How he got this one past his peer reviewers I cannot imagine! All kinds of contamination could have got into those threads in the years after they were cut off and before they were forwarded to him ( and why him when there were so many laboratories in italy where the level of expertise in textile analysis would have been many times greater?). So which experts decide who are the real experts? A good question.","date":"January 21, 2013 at 11:08 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Yes, you have hit the nail on the head.

Fanti produced three disparate ratings from his varied samples. 1) 752 BC plus or minus 400 years- this gets us nowhere but it was then subject to some arbitrary adjustment by Fanti to make it 300 BC plus or minus 400 years.2) 200 BC plus or minus 500 years.  If this was correct the date of the crucifixion does lie within this enormous range of 1000 years but this is hardly evidence when the range is so enormous.

Has Mario looked at a Liddell and Scott Greek Dictionary to see the possible meanings of ‘tetra’ as a prefix? The most likely meaning is that there has been four double foldings and as we have an example from the Parthenon frieze of a cloth folded exactly this way and handed to the priests BEFORE it was put round the cult statue of Athena (just as Christ was handed a cloth described as tetradiplon BEFORE he wiped his face on it), I think we have a good precedent for this. Wilson’s depiction of a cloth  on page 191 of his 2010 The Shroud is a complete muddle. He shows the Shroud, then figure a) shows the Shroud doubled to make half the size and he calls this ‘doubled’. So far so good. Then he doubles again for fig b) and for some reasons calls this ‘Doubled in two’- but why not ‘doubled for the second time’ or ‘doubled to make four sections’ as this is what figure b) actually shows. ‘Whatever does ‘doubled in two’ mean?Then he doubles again for figure c). and calls it ‘tetradiplon or doubled in four” while what the figure actually shows is the cloth doubled for a third time to make eight sections. There is no way that ‘tetradiplon or doubled in four’ can describe a cloth doubled three times to form eight sections which is what he actually shows. However, if he doubled the cloth for a fourth time then he would have the face of the Image cut into two and then the implausibility of his argument would be exposed.The sad thing is that he seems to get away with this befuddling- does nobody, other than Yannick, actually check up on him or his sources?","date":"March 26, 2014 at 2:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"OK. First we have to ask whether each of Fanti’s tests was on the same material. Then we have to be sure that all this material is original to the moment of creation of the Shroud (e.g. not dust collected externally). Then we have to be sure that the results of his tests can be set against an objective standard of dating established on other material. If all those three things obtain, we would then have to ask why he came up with such varying results and why he felt he needed to adjust the first result but not the other two. One obvious explanation is that two of the three or possibly all three of the tests failed to produce valid results.Then we have to justify bringing these disparate results together to make an average between them. If I go into a greengrocers and see two cauliflowers in one box, sixteen apples in another and twelve bananas in another, then with 100 per cent certainty, there is an average of ten pieces of fruit per box. But so what? It is a meaningless result and Fanti’s also seems to be. Perhaps also you,as a mathematician, would like to find the average date if Fanti had not arbitrarily adjusted the first date. I am sure it is simple maths for you but it might just end up with an average many years before Christ’s crucifixion and then what?Latendre. This has been discussed exhaustively earlier and I am not going to start again beyond summarising the argument. Wilson tells us that the Image of Edessa was folded tetradiplon (well, in one account it was BEFORE it was handed to Christ but there is no evidence it was so folded AFTER Christ had wiped his face although Wilson suggests it was). Although the word is not known elsewhere we have c.150 examples of Greek words with the prefix tetra-. The most likely meaning is that the cloth was folded double four times, making sixteen sections. We have no literary equivalent but we do have a religious one in that the cloth used to wrap the statue of Athena in the Panathenaic festival was folded double four times as can be seen in the sculpture on the Parthenon frieze in the British Museum in London. However, tetradiplon could just mean folded double to make four sections. Now the point I made and to which i had no response was that Wilson showed a cloth folded double three times so making the eight sections he ‘needed’ to show only the hard of the Shroud. In other words, he was creating an image that was not related in any way to any meaning of tetradiplon. With no one challenging me on this, I have long since moved on.","date":"March 25, 2014 at 5:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Latrendre. ‘tetradiplon most likely applies to the state of the cloth, not the process to fold it’.

So actually you and I agree, it is Wilson who brings in the question of process. So as we have no disagreement on this , I will not dust down my 1855 Liddell and Scott specially.The problem is not only Wilson’s muddled illustrations of the process but his assertion that tetradiplon refers to the cloth AFTER Jesus had wiped his face on it. This is not what the text says and he really irritates me when again and again I go back to a text he mentions and finds he has misled us.

It does not seem likely  that the matter has been scientifically settled for all time with scientific techniques developing as fast as they do.It seems likely that either by further direct testing of the Shroud or through evidence accumulated from other  medieval linens, there will at some point a significant move forward in understanding the Shroud.","date":"May 22, 2015 at 1:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/21/john-klotz-the-blind-men-the-elephant-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"John Klotz, the Blind men, the Elephant and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"A good project. While you are into genetics, which is not my field, you might look at the AB blood grouping of the Turin Shroud. I have my doubts about the analysis of the blood anyway but now it is firmly argued that it is blood group AB. The general consensus is that this was not known before AD 900 and was the result of incoming B groups from the east mingling with  native A groups on the Hungarian plain, with AB becoming genetically embedded in the population by 1100-1200. That the initial encounter was here is backed by the Hungarians having the highest percentage of AB of any native population in Europe, suggesting a longer period of interaction.. Analysis of Hungarian graves has also failed to find any evidence of AB before 900.  Like many consensuses I have found it stated by various people including a Hungarian professor summarising these findings in an online interview but haven’t got the original research.I have asked around for any evidence of earlier AB and there has only been ONE example provided, a very small Israeli sample of 1977 which found  AB among a family group there. However, some other early  testing suggesting  AB in Egypt  has now been redone and found invalid  ( I think it turned out to be A not AB) and without some replication here this does not seem to be firm enough evidence to overthrow the presumption that AB is post 900..As I already believe that the Shroud is medieval, partly because, despite all the mud thrown at the radiocarbon labs, no one has come up with any plausible reason why the tests were invalid and there is not an ounce of scientific evidence that the Shroud is first century, then the AB grouping is at the moment for me, merely supportive evidence which needs much more backing than i can give it. It may be that whatever is on the Shroud anyway is not blood from the AB group but the ‘Shroud is authentic’ believers have nailed it to their mast so they must be prepared for the obvious objection that AB blood is almost certainly medieval. Over to the scientists! meanwhile I will keep on asking my medical contacts – so far no one has come up with anything earlier than 900.","date":"January 22, 2013 at 11:16 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/what-is-a-shroud-expert-and-is-he-or-she-to-be-trusted/","cat":"culture","title":"What is a Shroud  “expert” – and is he or she to be trusted?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Fine, Sampath- it’s a miracle then – all settled – but just as so many miraculous cures were later given scientific explanations I am waiting to see what the scientists come up with.There is no reason why you should read anything I write- you are not my target audience when I write for History Today or the Church Times- but I am not arguing that anyone painted a photographic negative.

However, as you may or may not have read on this site, my own research on medieval relic cults has produced references to relics from ‘the Lord’s Tomb’ that came over in the first millennium from Jerusalem and are still in collections in northern France very close to Lirey. Yesterday, I came across references to stones from the Sepulchre in Jerusalem that had been brought back to the cathedral at Langres, just 125 kilometres from Lirey. Then there is a wealth of material on relics brought back from the Holy Land by crusaders, again direct to France.  Then there is bishop Gautier of Troyes  who was in charge of the allocation of the relics from Constantinople in 1204 and brought back many to Troyes, just twenty kilometres from Lirey (he is shown in a window in Troyes with a cup from the marriage feast at Cana!). Perhaps one of his retinue  brought back something as welI.  Then then is a native born man of Troyes, pope Urban IV who was Patriarch in Jerusalem before he became pope and lavished patronage on Troyes ( his basilica there still survives). Did he bring back any relics?In my own work on medieval relics, the Shroud does not feature because it was one of many thousands of cults competing against each other and certainly not the most interesting or important  but I don’t think  we historians can be accused of sitting by when, as here, I am providing those who do want to concentrate on the Shroud  with lots of leads from my own researches.

The problem with both Frei and Rogers is that there was no scientific checking of where they got their samples from (only hearsay) and there is evidence that Frei added in his pollen to one of his notorious pieces of sellotape. No one ever got so much pollen off the shroud as he did and it was not uniformly spread -most of it from one piece of sellotape that appears, on later inspection, to have been tampered with! ( Moreover much of his pollen came largely from insect-born pollen which could not have drifted onto the shroud – the assumption is that he added it in without realising that this would give him away!) Also both of them appear to have worked alone unsupervised so there is no way of having an independent check on their work. (This is crucial in the Frei case because we know he was reprimanded by the Swiss police for his misuse  of evidence in his police work.)

So there are problems and certain objects will be rejected for Carbon-14 but when it works it works. None of these apply to the Turin Shroud.I have to disagree with your assumption that all three respected international radio-cabon labs all collaborated in such a way that they produced a fourteenth century result. After all they are scientific institutions, depend on academic credibility for their survival and had no reason to fudge a date. I can’t believe that it would matter to them whether it was 14th century, 5-6th century ( the date when these images are first reported) or first century  – or even 1000 BC!

Thanks for your response.1) The Edessa face, as copied after 944, is nothing like the Shroud face – it has no markings of any suffering. This is because 2) The legends, and they are,of course ,legends relating to the Edessa image all say that it is an image taken from the living face of Christ. You have the problem of what is asserted to be a burial shroud to have become described as something completely different and linked in to a different set of legends. 3) Preservation of cloth. Ancient cloth can be preserved in the arid climate of Egypt,as known from many examples. Around Jerusalem it is destroyed by damp except in very rare circumstances. in Edessa, the modern Sanliurfa in south-eastern Turkey, the winters are very damp- it rains on average every other day in January.  You would  have a very real problem in preserving cloth from say 100 AD to 944. 4) We have no idea what the Turin Shroud, if it existed at all then, would have looked like in the tenth century, if the image was stronger , the closed eyes could not have been missed.The major problem with de Wesselow’s argument is his confusion over the many different shrouds, relics in Constantinople in 1204. It is estimated that there were 3,600 relics in Constantinople and the Pharos chapel, well protected within the imperial palace, had the imperial collection of relics, many of which were connected to the life , Passion, Crucifixion,etc. of jesus . So you start with his swaddling clothes, you have part of the Cross, the Crown of Thorns, a phial of his blood, the tunic in which he walked to Calvary, the Holy Lance, a robe of the Virgin and many, many more. There are also some burial sheets which are said to have smelled of myrrh and have been of cheap cloth- as there is no sign of any ointment ,etc on the Turin shroud and it is of a very fine weave , this can’t be it. Anyway we have a record of these relics from the Pharos chapel going to the Sainte-Chapelle of Louis IX in Paris ( he had bought the Crown of Thorns from the Pharos Chapel and it was housed here together with other relics from the Pharos chapel). A burial shroud of Jesus is listed in the Sainte-Chapelle inventory and a container with it inside is shown in an engraving of 1790. So we can be pretty sure that the Pharos sheets are these. In a listing of the Pharos relics, the Mandylion is listed as a SEPARATE item, but it disappears after that and we only know of it from the copies that show the open eyes and with no sign of the sufferings on the Turin Shroud. Then among the 3,6000 city relics, there is another shroud . This was at the Blachernae Chapel right at the other end of the city. This was a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary that was endowed with relics in the fifth century. It was a vulnerable position , just outside the city walls and by the shore. It is described as having a burial shroud of Christ that was full size and which was exhibited every Friday. This also disappeared in the disastrous sacking of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204 and some have argued that this is the only conceivable candidate for the Shroud of Turin.OK so Far? Well, de Wesselow argues that the Pharos sheets and the Mandylion are one and the same, despite them being listed separately. He then argues that the Pharos sheets were taken from the Chapel to the Blachernae Chapel. There is no documentary evidence of this. It would be unlikely for the imperial family to have surrendered one of its relics to such a vulnerable place as the Blachernae and anyway the Pharos sheets can hardly be the same as the single shroud of Blachernae. The simplest explanation is that we have two relics that disappeared, the Mandylion and the Blachernae Shroud, and one which survived and went to Paris ( the Pharos sheets). De Wesselow’s argument that they are all one and the same simply does not work.Carbon 14 Dating. Let us assume (unless you want to claim otherwise) that when the samples arrived at the three laboratories they were correctly tested. You will no doubt have read the Nature report on the 1988 testings. You will see that a sample of the Shroud was cut away after it was confirmed in front of the British Museum rep and the reps from the laboratories that it was of the same weave as the rest of the cloth. This was an open process. The samples were then carefully sealed. You are claiming that the British Museum rep. Dr. Tite and the cardinal then collaborated in swapping the Shroud sample with a piece of cloth from the fourteenth century. I am afraid such a collaboration is ludicrous and unless the match was very close , the reps from the laboratory would surely have spotted something when they unpacked the sample.Still de Wesselow seems to entertain this.So you have two alternatives. 1) The sample was so contaminated that,although first century, the mix of contamination was such that it came out as fourteenth century. Yet contamination is a common problem and the laboratories each cleaned their samples. They each used their own methods but the dating still agreed with each other. As de Wesselow admits ‘ Some of these [contamination] theories are more plausible than others, but none has gained widespread acceptance, let alone been proven’.The Oxford lab did a test on one theory put forward by John Jackson that the contamination was by carbon monoxide and found that this had no effect on samples. So if even de Wesselow cannot give support to any contamination theory, why should any one else?20 The added patch. No one spotted that the sample was any different from the rest of the weave. Flury-Lemburg, who was meant to be the textile expert, said that an extra weave could not be added without it being spotted (which is why she refused to endorse the ‘added patch’ theory.  Raymond Rogers was using samples that were not scientifically attested as genuine (you can spot this from his own report on this) so, when placed against the sample used by the labs, they can hardly stand up. (One of the great mysteries is how his essay ever got accepted as supposedly peer-reviewed -he did not, of course, provide any carbon-14 dates  to support the age of the Shroud.)So this is why many people take the view that there is no sufficient reason to challenge the carbon-14 dating by the three labs in 1988. The Shroud has been so mauled around, pieces taken off by sellotape, the controversial cleaning of 2002, that it is unlikely that anyone else will be allowed a go at it but I suspect that any carbon-14 dating would come up with the same dates. It is hard to see how, even if there were problems in the testing, they could be so significant to end up with a date 1300 years earlier.No.I don’t know how the image was created.

The shroud.com site is dedicated to the idea that the Shroud is authentically first century ( so far as I can see) and one has to read a lot of articles from other sources  to get a fuller picture (e.g the Max Frei pollen analysis is now seen to be fraudulent but  I doubt whether this is covered in shroud.com -please prove me wrong but I am still having it quoted at me as if it were accepted). The real problem is that articles against the 1988 dating are full of insinuations that are not in themselves enough to cause doubts about the 1988 dating. There are many hypotheses floating  around  about the samples none of which seems to have gained much support. So please  present your case clearly. The Oxford people have made clear they are quite open to reassessing their results if they are given direct evidence to challenge them. As an example of their readiness to respond, they tested out, for instance, John Jackson’s theory of carbon monoxide contamination for the Shroud and showed that c.m. did not affect the dating. But until clear evidence is provided against the 1988 dating one can hardly expect the labs to drop everything and retest. Those who want to argue against the 1988 testing must get their act together with a coherent consensus about what went wrong. Lots of individual researchers coming up with their own pet theories gets us nowhere.De Wesselow is not much help here because his critique of Carbon -14 dating is simply a muddle and he cannot himself provide any clear reason for challenging the 1988 testing.

Inevitably the surface would often crack up and the cloth was then discarded although in cases where there was some value given to the painting it was repainted.Clearly the pigments varied in thickness and consistency but after some centuries in place -the evidence suggests that for the Shroud they really only began to break off completely in the mid-nineteenth century as the lithograph in Beldon Scott of the 1868 exposition suggests- then the linen immediately underneath the gesso would have been discoloured. The discoloration would vary according to the thickness of the paint on top and possibly its colours. Hence you have the resulting ‘three-dimensional’ aspect of the Shroud.The best way to settle this will be through finding other examples of former painted linens whose pigments have fallen off. The best example I know is the central panels of the Zittern Veil as the pigments have gone ( steamed off by Russian looters in WWII) and there are images similar to those on the Shroud on the linen underneath, but I would like to find more.Although I am told that my theories have been totally debunked,- not sure quite where and by whom- I can at least set them out clearly.

That is why I shall be seeing the Niccolo dell’Arca Lamentation in Bologna three times in this year alone. His examples are from high class art as one would expect from a Courtauld trained art historian- he does not see the relevance of more down to earth art such as the illustrations of the naked Christ with all over scourge marks and squiggles of blood like those on the Shroud to be found in the Holkham Bible of c.1330 which actually match the images on the Shroud.

One crucial divide in Shroud studies is between those who believe the Shroud now is as it was originally created and those who don’t. That is the main difference between de Wesselow and myself- I think  the early depictions are the vital clues.

This is not to exclude it from my database of early Shroud descriptions but to realise that it is not representative of the spectrum of original depictions.The Shroud images only make sense as linen discoloured by being overlaid by gesso and paint for centuries. We know that they were ONCE painted , there is evidence that the paint disintegrated in the nineteenth century and not surprisingly there  is some discolouration just on the surface of the Shroud underneath as the result of the overlay .I have never seen any alternative explanation that makes any kind ofsense.

All this is supported by experts and when you have other faded linens then there is a plausible scenario to explain the present state if the Shroud.The ball us in your court to set out an alternative method of creating the images, which explains why these images were created as they were and why a totally unrecorded method of making images, one that could remain chemically unchanged for seven hundred years, was used, probably uniquely in this particular case.

They survive because half the image is still intact. In most cases when the images are faded altogether they will have been thrown away.So we know beyond any doubt that linens painted in the medieval period can fade. When I read the many accounts that describe a painting vivid in blood, one that was even thought to be recent ,I have no problems in suggesting that the Shroud was one of these now faded linens. This is a hypothesis that I leave you and anyone else to challenge. It is the best fit explanation of the Shroud we have today- the one that is closest to the documentary evidence.I think that some of the contributors here do not know much about medieval art. I would suggest an I.introduction such as the Oxford History Of Art which has excellent reproductions that show that those paintings that have not faded are amazingly Bright. This morning I was viewing a Giotto Madonna and Child – early fourteenth century no less. It comes from the Uffizi gallery in Florence but it was damaged in a terrorist attack in 1993 but has now been restored. It is travelling around Italy being shown off  and it looks wonderful although they have left one hole in the canvas as a record of the attack on it. The colours are bright and the Virgin Mary sits on a bright red cushion. It this had been blood it would have been shocking but because it just a cushion we just admired the vivid redness of what is probably vermilion.What I find extraordinary, indeed incomprehensible, is why you think that the Shroud was not originally painted as richly as this. I have read a lot about medieval art as I have to lecture to groups on it in front of paintings and I have never heard of anyone creating a painting with scorches ,etc. Why would they want to when there were so many painters around who would create the real thing for observers to see.Some posters seem to think it was extraordinary that people came to see the Shroud at Lirey but in the years after the Black Death with half the population dead there was a frenzied rush towards new relic cults. It does not seem that the Lirey cult lasted very long before the bishop closed it down and, as we know, when expositions began again in 1390 it was made clear that this was not the authentic grave cloth but could still be venerated. Pope Francis is following in this same tradition.If Francis’s face had left an imprint on the cloth, what would it have looked like. Certainly not like the face of the man on the Shroud!!","date":"November 7, 2014 at 8:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"But de Wesselow did not look at the original depictions of the expositions.

So I have the following disciplines to offer from my articles, iconography of the fourteenth century, blood  cults of the fourteenth century, weaving techniques e.g the treadle loom as the  most likely loom for the Shroud, background history to relic cults in the medieval period, medieval liturgies and ceremonies – in addition I have consulted Mike Spyer a professor of physiology, on the blood stains and, from the STURP articles he cannot see how the STURP team could say that they had found human blood.He took the conventional view, that all forensic scientists I have consulted have taken, that the blood stains are too red to be real blood. Heller or Adler’s hypothesis of stress and bright red blood has never been replicated or taken seriously by anyone other than Barrie Schwortz. Can you imagine how different criminal trials with bloodstain evidence would be if it were true?I did do an earlier post from my IPhone that I asked people to read in my article the observations of the fifteenth and sixteenth century of the blood stains ( please don’t comment back if you have not read and absorbed them- I am entitled to be judged on what I have actually written) and then defend the view that the Shroud looked then as it does now. Why did one observer described the  stains as ‘admirably painted’ (not the D’Arcis memorandum- another source) and another describes the bloodstains as so bright that it was if they were recent. I am taking this as primary evidence that the Shroud looked very differently to these observers in that they could not possibly be describing the bloodstains as we see them today. So once you accept that the Shroud did look differently, the search is on to reconstruct as far as possible how it did actually look and work from there. This is conventional art history and I am not sure how de Wesselow missed out on his training here.News from one of my numerous contacts in the publishing world is that de Wesselow has a new book on the Shroud on the way – so perhaps he will elaborate on his inadequate dismissal of the ‘ this is not a painting ‘ there.

None found so far .Anyone who has been lucky to see some of the great medieval art of the fourteenth century will not have any problem in recognising the bright colours of paintings of that period( well certainly the ones that have been lucky enough to have been preserved over seven hundred years without fading!)This morning back home after several days of total self-indulgence ( without a tour group to lecture to)  in Lucca and Pistoia looking at medieval paintings in their original settings, I began to think how would one ,as a historian, START exploring they over – hyped ( by STURP and the National Geographic as well as others)  ‘ mystery ‘ of  the Shroud.First things first. How is it woven? It must have been woven first before we even get onto to the images – unless the images existed as a sort of holograph onto which a cloth drifted and held them down! There is absolutely no problem  in making the Shroud on a medieval treadle loom , first known in Europe from about AD 1000. The width is typical as the weaver could not stretch further than about 130 cms. The length is fine as these looms allowed the cloth to be rolled around a rod at the top and certainly could go further than 430 cms. The use of treadles to manipulate the shuttles to create a three-in-one herringbone is also possible and certainly much easier to effect than in any known ancient loom.So if you want to challenge this please provide an ancient loom that can weave a cloth similar to the Shroud. And then there is the issue of the Z spin of the yarn that places the linen into the  Western Mediterranean…So one STARTS  with the hypothesis that is a medieval cloth . It is important to establish such hypotheses that are fairly basic and then challenge people to overthrow them.And all this BEFORE we have got round to putting the images on . . .I leave it to the surviving members of the disbanded STURP to make their defence  but my point is that they did not sit down and start with asking the basic questions that one needs to START with and so have misled us all by making the Shroud  a totally unnecessary  mystery.Now that people are talking to me about this, I simply say I am not taking any credit for taking the approach that any professional historian/ archaeologists/ art historian  would have taken start with the basics – in this case the weave – from which all else follows.Meanwhile whatever is happening on this site, life moves on as others are beginning to become involved.","date":"November 8, 2014 at 3:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Please read  the original descriptions of the impact of the blood on fifteenth and sixteenth century observers in my article and then defend your view that the Shroud is unchanged from 1449.","date":"November 5, 2014 at 7:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S .

That is an honest opinion based on what evidence we have.I have placed the Shroud within a very important medieval ceremony taking place on a day when Christians traditionally rejoice at the Resurrection. It is quite understandable that the Shroud should have been venerated for over seven hundred years and I think that anyone should be satisfied that that it the case. After all, I am not saying that it is a forgery or a hoax but a cloth that was created for a sacred ceremony. I don’t think I should be denounced for saying that. It is hardly ‘debunking’ the Shroud by giving it a sacred function. The chances that it was the burial cloth of Christ were always remote and I think  pope Francis is right in not encouraging that belief.","date":"November 5, 2014 at 5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"O.K.

It assumes that the chemistry of the Shroud has remained unchanged for seven hundred years despite the many expositions that we know were pretty turbulent affairs – as the nuns caught by the customs  officers with brandy in their bottles labelled ‘Holy Water’ put it – Good Lord, another miracle’.David has dug up yet another quotation that shows beyond reasonable doubt that the Shroud looked very differently in the sixteenth century . I have seen the two exact replicas of the Shroud in Turin and I can’t see bloodstains ‘as if they were recent,’ even though Thomas can, and, as David reminds us, the Shroud was described in 1449 as painted.As a historian I have to make a judgement and in the end I give up on those who really do believe that the Shroud was the same in1350 as it is now ,although I am giving Colin a last chance to provide his evidence.Just as I can’t see the Shroud in the Pray Codex as it shows Christ being laid out without the bloodstains on his body when anyone seeing the Shroud would put the bloodstains on the body, in the end one just has to accept that one has the wrong spectacles and continue on one’s way trying to find the truth about the Shroud.I have been in Pistoia looking at the wonderful 1260 Crucifix with scenes of the Passion they have in the cathedral there. There is blood flowing from the five wounds, but no marks of any flagellation and the panel with the flagellation scene shows no blood at all. Christ has a halo, not the Crown of Thorns. The change in iconography over the next eighty years is indeed dramatic.

First you have to create a medieval linen  weave. The medieval experts tell us that it has to be quite a thick weave of linen ( just as the Shroud is) if it is to be a suitable surface to paint on. Then you seal it ,usually with a gesso of collagen derived from rabbit skin boiled up and mixed with calcium carbonate ( as found in large quantities by STURP). But as Ceninno Ceninni advises, in the fifteenth century, you must cover only the outer fibrils of the cloth( as again STURP found on the Shroud).  If it goes under the surface you will not be able to fold and unfold the cloth. Then in top of the gesso once it has dried, you can paint an image. If you need bloodstains ( as the early observers of the Shroud reported there to be in vivid colours ) then probably you need vermilion even if it does not dry like real blood.Now you have your painted linen. You need to keep,it very carefully because even with a sealed surface it remains vulnerable to damp and decay and the vast majority of the painted linens that we know, from church and monastic inventories, to have existed have long since perished.The problem is if you expose it, especially in Turin in May when it is the month of the heaviest rainfall, and unfurl it dramatically  year after year in front of the enormous crowds that get to see it, the surface begins to fragment . It may take four or five hundred years before almost all, or perhaps all, the pigments have dropped off and there are only a few remnants of the calcium carbonate to be found by later researchers, although here is at least one report that some of the vermilion was still there in 1978.But in the end after six hundred years, the bright colours of the blood and images that were once said to be there, have faded and one can hardly make out what is still left. The Crown of Thorns has gone, the loincloth, that was painted on by 1578 in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent against lascivia in religious imagery, has long gone and you can no longer see that there was once a gap on the dorsal image between the elbows and the body, making it clear that the front and the back image could not have been created simultaneously as the arms would not have reached in the front to cover the pubic area.And although this is hard to believe, there are some people who still think that the faded images of today are still the same as they were In 1350 and perhaps even in AD 30 but they must be left to their own fantasies and the rest of us must move on in the real world.The problem is that we have not got five or six hundred years to paint a linen cloth according to the medieval methods and wait until the images are faded. So perhaps the Shroudies will win after all.","date":"November 6, 2014 at 4:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"David G  .

So we have cases where a loincloth was put onto a nude body to comply with the decree.  The Last Judgement by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel is the example that most people know of- the figures have now been restored to the originals. i am simply arguing that as I know of no case where a depiction of the Shroud before 1563 had a loincloth on it and every depiction after 1578 does have a loincloth on it (until the pigments of the added paint fell off) then it is likely that the loincloth was added as a result of the decree.  When you discover that two devotees of the Shroud, both of whom appear in depictions as the presiding clergymen at an exposition of the Shroud, are known to have been directly associated with the decree, one of them actually being one of the signatories, then you put the evidence together and wait for someone to refute it.Relics suffered all kinds of fates, pieces were cut off, bodies were divided into many parts, there are many fragments of the True Cross and individual thorns from the Crown of Thorns or  relics were concealed in reliquaries. So there would have been no taboos about adding a loincloth to the Shroud whether it was/is authentic or not. I just added it as an interesting part of the story of the Shroud and I am not sure why you are making such a fuss about it!","date":"October 19, 2014 at 2:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Daveb.

These must be divided into the depictions of expositions, such as in Tempesta’s engraving, and copies of it found in other contexts. We must be careful with copies- those in churches in Piedmont are surely inspired by the Shroud even if they do not have the fire marks – other so- called copies, those in Spain , may not be direct copies of the Shroud at all but actually similar clothes used in the Spanish Easter ceremonies. For me the major remaining  mystery of the Shroud is why it has two images on it when others have only one. ( Of course,  in Byzantine art double images are common.)Only when we have all the depictions can we begin to make a final assessment. Were the marks more vivid in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries?  Were some features such as the Crown of Thorns and thumbs on the hands shown consistently across the decades by different artists portraying the expositions.?Can we say that the figures were naked before 1563 but with a loincloth afterwards? With the loincloth are the artists each painting their own loincloth or are they portraying the loincloth they can see on the Shroud.?So there is a great deal of basic work that has not yet been done. I am concentrating on working with those who accept that the Shroud is fourteenth century but realise that there is still so much work to be done on it.I have to say that I find it ridiculous when I read that in some way I really know the Shroud is authentic but that I  want fame and fortune by pretending that it is not. I really do believe that the evidence is overwhelming that the shroud comes from the fourteenth century. As I can see from the worldwide publicity a single article in the Guardian shows that  a new debate can begin on other websites that deal with medieval iconography, ancient weaving and medieval liturgy. This is where I will be working. Who knows where we will be in a year’s time in research on the Shroud once these specialists become involved?","date":"October 26, 2014 at 9:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"No, I am retracting nothing. I am simply saying that for completeness sake we should assemble a full data base. That is just standard research which, in the case of the Shroud ,has never been done and I am pleased to find that on the web, among the many reactions to my article, some of which have ,of course come to me personally, people are beginning to say this. So this is a positive outcome  of my article.  If we get a  full data base I think we will build up a great deal more evidence about how the Shroud looked when it was first painted. I think the evidence, on the depictions of Shroud expositions I have seen, will support me in the loin cloth but there  is still so much to be done. For instance, I found , in the British Museum print section, a depiction of an exposition I had never seen before and then when I asked the Royal Library in Turin for a particular depiction showing  Carlo Borromeo which they have they sent me a completely different one, which again I had never seen. So there is a lot of work to be done here, possibly for a Master’s dissertation or even a PhD.But we come back to the first issue. What does it matter if there was a loincloth added or not? It is just an interesting part of th e Shroud!’s history that has nothing to do with whether it is authentic or not. Much more crUcial is the ‘all-over’ flagellation that Is so prominent on the Shroud but not known in medieval iconography before 1290-1300.and yet no one has raised this at all!We need to date the Viverone depiction, which is an independent copy, of course, and not an actual depiction of an exposition. I think the the latter should take precedence for sh owing what people actually saw on the Shroud. The way the clergy are holding the Shroud is more typical of the later sixteenth  and seventeenth century but I am glad at this issue is being raised as it is typical of those what will make more sense when we have a full data base to make a comparative study.","date":"October 28, 2014 at 3:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘ large’ was the word used in the STURP  1982 paper for the calcium carbonate.

I am resting my findings on the research I have done so far which shows that there are many features- the Crown of Thorns is an obvious example- that are clearly shown to be there on many of the depictions. The leaving of the Crown of Thorns on the body of Christ after he is taken down from the Cross appears in the late thirteenth / early fourteenth century, together with the over-all flagellation marks that result from the adoption of Isaiah 1.6.  as  a premonition of the flagellation. (This is not my idea but that of the top expert on Passion iconography , Professor James Marrow – let’s admit there are experts around who have better things to do than study the Shroud but whose work offers important information.)My article, as you will see if you have the time to read it, builds up a lot of circumstantial and more than circumstantial evidence  to make a coherent argument for the weaving and painting of the Shroud in the first half of the fourteenth century and it was so vivid that people were overwhelmed by the power of images, especially the bloodstains, that have now  faded.","date":"October 28, 2014 at 12:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Eric.

Medieval gesso as found north of the Alps was a mixture of calcium carbonate and rabbit skin glue ( collagen) although different mixes were possible. Once the surface of the  Shroud came under pressure , the gesso would have fallen outwards not inwards.Obviously I would like clarification of what STURP meant by ‘ large’ . It seems that there were significant amounts of calcium carbonate and when I am in my office I shall go back to the original report to see whether they have provided any further information beyond, as I recall ‘ accumulations of dust’Your  alternative explanations seem very speculative. It underestimates the very rough handling of the Shroud that is documented in the seventeenth century expositions when dust and limestone fragments would certainly have been shaken off while one would expect some elements of a glue gesso to still be sticking there.When I submitted all the so – called  blood reports I could find to a Professor of Physiology he read them and said he was totally unconvinced that this was blood but more indicative of collagen. So we have evidence,still to be confirmed, of the ingredients of gesso on the Shroud.As you will know STURP specifically said that they had not examined any medieval linen paintings so they had nothing to go on. This was an extraordinary omission. If they had bothered to do some basic research on painted linens before they set out to Turin they would have been in a much stronger position to make credible claims about painting.As you will see from my article and the podcast just issued by HT, I keep making the point that there is so much basic research on iconography and medieval linen paintings that has not yet been started.

I do believe I have a better hypothesis for the formation of the images than any others going but if you want an answer to how the image was formed you will need to paint a linen cloth according to the medieval manuals, as quoted in my articles, with a layer of gesso on the outer fibrils only, with paint on top of that. Then you need to apply some rough treatment, e.g. dramatic unfoldings, as in the Tempesta engraving I illustrate, over many decades, wait for five hundred years and you may have just the faded image left. As none of us are likely to be around in five hundred years time, the matter may never be resolved but I am putting out the call for conservationists who specialise in ancient painted linens to see if t hey have other examples with which to compare the image on the Shroud.The fully illustrated article( I.e. with several more illustrations) will be in the digital edition of History Today next week with an accompanying podcast I recorded earlier today.

Lamberti was actually present to sign the decree, Borromeo was the link man between his uncle ,pope Pius 1V and the Council and he enforced the decree in Milan when he became archbishop there. There are engravings / depictions of both of them as the central figure holding up the Shroud.

You can find Thurston’s view in the venerable 1907 Catholic  Encyclopedia., article on Shroud that he wrote for them. Once you have got towards the end of my article  you will find my acknowledgement of this as there is evidence to support him. So the implication that Chevalier and Thurston conspired to say that the Shroud was a fraud does not hold- has JM had this article peer reviewed or on what grounds is it accepted as scholarly?It is quite clear that many of the commentators here have not read my article in detail . They will find when they do that I do not believe that the Shroud was a fake in the sense of a artefact designed to deceive – why would Clement VII have allowed it to be displayed with an indulgence attached if that had been the view in 1390? Rather it was one of many, objects of veneration given spiritual status by the Church but no more – the same position as today- at least the Church is consistent!Ultimately for me, the success of my article will depend on whether professional historians, art historians, experts in weaving, etc, endorse my views as that is the world I work in.

So far as I know JM’s article has never been given academic credibility – where has it been published? ,where has it been reviewed in the mainstream academic world? It does not make any kind of sense to me as it implies that Thurston claimed that the Shroud was a fraud when he quite clearly states otherwise in the famous Catholic Encyclopedia of 1907. So Markwardt starts with a fake premise and argues from there. Certainly not an article that proves anything and in fact it is irrelevant to my argument anyway as I state quite clearly that the Shroud was not a forgery but was painted for a specific purpose – the Easter ceremonies -without any intention to deceive anyone.Jeanne de Charny had an unsuccessful attempt, in the eyes of the Church , to say it was authentic. The dukes of Savoy claimed the same thing and then there are the Shroudies today. Meanwhile the Catholic Church has, in fact, kept to the same stance established by Clement VII in 1390, , worthy of veneration ( probably because of miracles, alas unrecorded), but with no support for authenticity – as pope Francis has reaffirmed – presumably the exposition of 2015 follows the official Church line. There is nothing in my article that would offend the Church as nothing in it contradicts or challenges their official teaching on the Shroud. I can at least sleep easy on that one.The Shroud is not a fake- the most probably hypothesis by far is that it is a typical medieval object of veneration, images painted on a cloth of c.1325, now sadly faded.

Just one of the many areas where the artefact that ‘has been researched more fully than any other artefact in history’ needs much more research!! A clue might lie with the Besancon Shroud, now vanished, of course, but probably a single image grave cloth from the same ceremony. There is a report that it was associated with the revival of a dead body. This would give it the status to allow it to be preserved and venerated. So I suggest, and this is no more than a suggestion, that there was some miracle or miracles associated with our Shroud. There is some support given to this by the wording about the Shroud on the Lier copy that tells of the Shroud, then at Chambery, having miraculous properties.We do have to explain how what was probably no more than a stage-prop got to the point where Clement VII was able to give an indulgence to those who visited it.  The next move, to suggest it was a genuine relic, is ,of course a different story and the line from Jeanne de Charny to the dukes of Savoy to the Shroudies is a history subject in itself, one which runs alongside but distinct from the official view of the Church ( other than perhaps a pope or two who did believe it was the real thing).All grist to the historian’s mill!","date":"October 19, 2014 at 7:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘ It had only to seem credible to 14th century pilgrims who were drawn to a must-see relic that claimed to be a bigger-and-better version of the Veil of Veronica’.The Veil was an impression of the face of Christ when still alive.

That was hardly a problem as you had lots of relics claiming to be the blood of Christ in the fifteenth century and declaring one authentic did not necessarily diminish the authenticity of the others- there was enough blood to go around.

Having ploughed my way through 150 examples of Greek words where tetra was added, the most likely translation  is doubled four times- which is exactly the way they folded the Parthenon cloth  as seen in the Parthenon frieze in The British Museum.

You only have to compare the illustration of Wilson’s tetradiplon cloth with any possible translation of tetradiplon to see that while a cloth folded double four times is a possible translation (and backed by the visual evidence of the Parthenon cloth)  and so is a cloth doubled (twice) to make four sections is another , but less likely, possible translation, Wilson shows a cloth doubled three times but labels it as a cloth doubled in four which cannot possibly fit with the illustration as his makes up eight! This kind of thing should be simple to sort out because it is so obviously wrong.The painting issue is much more difficult to disprove as we have the 1449 description of the Shroud being painted to put alongside the 1389 text and we have lots of depictions which show the images much more powerful than they are now and it is hard to know any other way of producing such strong images other than paint as documented in the medieval manuals. We also know that painted surfaces on linens disintegrated very easily and so the question, which I leave to experts in conservation of textiles to sort out, is what is left on the linen when the pigments fall off a painted cloth after many centuries. This is the key question to focus on.The solution to the so- called mystery of the Shroud will eventually be sorted out with an up-to-date examination of the surface of the Shroud again so let’s all push for that.

They are there and the focus must be on getting the Shroud and medievalists of various disciplines together as was done in 1973.  I think the dating of Noemi Gabrielli, originally Director of the Art Galleries of the Piedmont, was, iconographically, a century too late but she did examine the Shroud close-up as an art historian and considered that the images were ‘drawn by the artist directly onto a wet cloth stretched on a frame, using a compound of sepia-coloured clay and yellow ochre diluted in a resinous liquid’ and she goes on toe describe the technique. Since then there has been an immense amount of work done on painted linens of which she would not have been aware but it is high time it was exploited. Disregard it if you want.I am happy to debate here but my focus is on a completely different sort of specialists, those who actually know something about what paint has or has not done to medieval linens seven hundred years on.

In my article I quote a French Bible dictionary of 1912 which specifically mentions that the Easter cloths were painted on. I am cautious about using such a late source but there are also the early Mozarbic rites for Easter that describe how ‘Peter ran with John to the tomb and saw the recent imprints of the dead and risen man on the linens’. This certainly suggests that linens with images on them were associated with the Easter rituals.What often happened, and I have come across many documented examples, is that an object that no one believed for a moment to be authentic, suddenly achieved a status by becoming associated with a miracle. So at Prato, there was a perfectly ordinary fresco of the Virgin and Child. An eight year old boy reported that the Virgin had come down from the picture, dumped the baby Jesus on the ground, gone into the local prison, cleaned it out, came back, picked up the babe and popped back into the fresco.

In fact, if it were not sent, it is more likely to be a true representation of what happened. With such a major misconception I dislike the insinuations that Markwardt makes about Chevalier’s character. They are unwarranted.Lewis and Short do not mention that ‘depingo’ can be translated as ‘copy’ and it is certainly the fullest Latin dictionary i know and is my mainstay in such things. I have the copy belonging to my great uncle Kenneth Freeman who was Senior Classic at Cambridge so I assumed he had only the best! We have the 1449 reference to painting (‘depicta’) as well.I have repeatedly said that the Shroud surface needs to be examined with the latest technology by experts who are used to dealing with ancient linens, painted and otherwise. None were on the STURP team, as their failure to recognise that an image just on the surface of the cloth was just what the medieval craftsmen’s manuals advised ( in order to let painted flags flutter in the breeze).I am happy to rely on the findings of specialists. I suspect that the so-called negative image is the result of the different thicknesses of the original paint/pigments  before they disintegrated but I await the expert examination. The important thing will be to focus on the hypothesis to rule it in or out (as the Oxford lab helpfully did for John Jackson’s carbon monoxide affecting the dating hypothesis which they ruled out).Even if the images on the Shroud remain  unexplained ,there is no logical reason why this makes the Shroud authentic. It just makes it one of thousands of objects in a similar state waiting for science to advance enough to provide an explanation for them..I await a single piece of scientific evidence that is replicable and so acceptable to the scientific community as a whole that the Shroud dates to before- well I was going to say AD 50 but I shall be generous and say AD1000 as that would take it into a different context from that of the medieval period which is where my own ( limited) investigations are focussed.","date":"May 5, 2015 at 4:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I totally agree with you, Colin.

They seem unnecessarily complicated especially as there is no reason to suggest that the original creation of the Shroud was out of the ordinary within the context of its own day.The tetradiplon issue was important for two reasons. First, Wilson gave a misleading summary of the  text he was relying on by implying that the cloth had been folded tetradiplon AFTER Christ had wiped his face on it while the text clearly says that it was folded tetradiplon BEFORE it was handed to Christ with no evidence that it refolded as such afterwards.Secondly, we have the interesting  depiction of the cloth used in the Parthenon ceremonies, that went on into the fourth century AD, that shows that the cloth there was indeed folded double four times. Again Wilson gives a misleading illustration that shows only three double foldings- if he had the fourth it would have cut through the face and ruined his argument!I think it is best to leave it at that and not discuss further why Wilson made these apparently elementary errors.I don’t have Jack Markwardt’s killer instinct in these matters!","date":"May 5, 2015 at 6:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am sorry, Colin, but i have obviously missed your references to ancient textiles that you have worked on.

The Shroud received a lot of rough treatment as it was folded, unfolded and refolded many times especially In the seventeenth century.  In fact it was remarkable in that the pigments seem to have lasted until the nineteenth century. A lithograph of 1868 shows that by then one of the images seems to have disintegrated and it was just this exposition that saw the Shroud placed in a frame for the first time. This illustration looks as if it is five hundred years earlier and it will probably have survived because it will have been kept out of the lights and have  a vellum base but I can’t say more than that. It certainly will have a better base than linen and won’t have been folded. It will have been kept shut up for much of its life. The linens that have survived with their images intact have usually been pasted onto wooden backing.I did an adult course at Cambridge University on medieval illustrated manuscripts and there are wonderful ones surviving from as early as the fifth century because they have been kept out of the light.

The History Today article is online but regrettably without the full set of illustrations that show how the blood stains on the Shroud echo those of the fourteenth century iconography – on the Holkham Bible Christ for instance. To see the illustrations you have to buy the print version and it may not be easily available outside the UK. it was apparently too expensive to get picture rights to show them online throughout the world.    I am not suggesting in my History Today article that the Shroud of Turin was a run of the mill relic. Bearing in mind that the only information anyone would have had on the burial cloth of Jesus is what they would have read in the gospels (lintemina, sudarium), no medieval forger would ever have produced single cloth with images on it and hoped to have deceived anyone at all. No, it was clearly produced for some other purpose and I suggest that the Easter Quem Queritis  ceremony is the most likely original context for it. So far the experts on medieval drama at Cambridge I have consulted think i may well be right  but I am getting them to ask around other specialists. It is as this specialist level that my article will stand or fall, not on the Shroud Story website.The grant of an indulgence by Clement VII suggests that the cloth became associated with miracles. We have hundreds of recorded examples of artefacts that were clearly not relics,and no one believed them to be, but which still had spiritual significance. My own guess is that Jeanne de Charny (an Italian professor has been in touch already to say I should actually refer to her as Jeanne de Vergy) was responsible for converting what was an object of spiritual status into a relic. She was quickly slapped down and to avoid any ‘fraud’ her son was told he could not expose it again without  explicitly saying that it was NOT the real thing. The Dukes of Savoy were able to get away with it more easily.I think it is exciting that we have what appears to be the only surviving example of a cloth associated with the most joyous ceremonies of all, those held at Easter, and I am completely perplexed by those who appear to be arguing that there is anything anti-Christian in my approach!Still, most of my discussions are with academics in the fields covered because, at the risk of repeating myself, it will be here that the issue will be decided.

It seems important to stress this  as there are still people who argue that the Shroud is chemically unchanged from seven hundred, even two thousand years ago,. You then GO ON to look at the depictions of expositions. I use the Tempesta  1613 engraving as my first example, partly because we know from his meticulous view of Rome in 1593  that he was very accurate and partly because he was resident for some time in the royal court in Turin and it seems clear that he saw the Shroud on several occasions. It is not just the images are much stronger (as they need to be if you are going to get crowds to come and see the expositions ( now with the faded cloth you have to get up close to see anything)) , it is that you can see features you can no longer see, the Crown of Thorns on front and back of the head, the long hair at the back, the gap between the elbows and the body of the back image( showing that the crossed hands are impossible if this  is the same body) , the loincloth ( after 1578).As I then note this is only one of perhaps fifty depictions of expositions . As they are made by different artists at different times , largely between 1578 and 1750 when – probably because the images were beginning to fade so large scale expositions are not so impressive- they diminish in number.You then need to work on a data base. For instance from the Royal Savoy catalogue depictions of 1998, I have taken thirty photocopies and every one shows the loincloth in place and it seems to be the same loincloth recorded by different artists. A lot of the depictions show thumbs on the hands. As I argue in my article and would repeat here, we desperately need to do what should have been done years ago and create a data base of all the depictions so that we can confirm what features there were one on the Shroud but which now can no longer be seen. What is without doubt is that the images were stronger, they contained features no longer there, and that the bloodstains were in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the features that stood out.N.B. Contributors here have talked of paint flaking off. No, these were medieval ground pigments and they would have been in small particles. This is why the disintegration of the paint would have been very different from modern oil- based paint that, as we all know, does tend to flake off.No one can possibly say that I don’t put out my arguments clearly and that I concentrate on hard evidence.

It is the fourth century that you first get sustained Christian relic cults, the deliberate use of relics as a means of accessing heaven through an object, using them as a talisman for good fortune ( e.g. Constantine using a nail from the Cross on his horse’s bridle) or using relics as mechanisms through which healing or the expulsion of demons ,etc, were effected. This is a much more sophisticated level than just preserving things and you get the first sustained theological arguments for the veneration of relics in the fourth century. The Wikipedia article, although pretty elementary, does mention the important figures in elevating relic cults such as Ambrose and Augustine.There were certainly memories of where some martyrs were buried but there was no systematic use of the actual dug -up bones being used as spiritual forces before the fourth century. Ambrose of Milan’s opportune discovery of the bones of Gervasius and Protasius in the 380s when he used them as a means of boosting his own reputation is one of the best known early examples and his transfer of some  dust from them to Rouen one of the earliest examples of a translatio- the placing of a relic in an above ground shrine where it could be openly venerated. By 400 the emphasis was on public display, carrying relics in processions, having them in shrines,etc. No need for secrecy, in fact the opposite. There is no point in having a relic if you hide it away from veneration.Of course, in many cases the relics are new or are old bones ,etc, that are assumed to be genuine. So there are lots of stories of discoveries .e.g the bones of the martyr Stephen in Jerusalem in 415. No reason at all to think that they were the real thing and until any of these are actually dated to the first century or have some definite evidence of provenance then I am sceptical. There was just too great an incentive to produce a relic which was claimed to be authentic. So far, but we are waiting on CNN, not a single relic has been proved to be first century.No need to answer the rants of OK.","date":"March 8, 2015 at 3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/28/hints-about-shroud-of-turin-episode-in-cnn-series/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Hints About Shroud of Turin Episode in CNN Series"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"And Christ is always depicted in Byzantine iconography as wrapped in bands- I saw a wonderful example just a couple of weeks ago in the Greek monastery of Hosios Loukas.

Good to have something we can agree on- after all the Oxford lab identified only one cotton fibre in their sample which they were able to remove before the radio- carbon testing. Rogers was misleading in suggesting that there was more than minor contamination , even a reweaving with cotton threads,- especially if he was extrapolating his conclusions to the sample of the Shroud actually tested by Oxford.Gilbert Raes gave the good explanation that cotton and flax were often woven and spun in the same workshops and this would explain the presence of fibres. After 1200 there were massive imports of raw cotton to Italy and ,through Marseilles, to other parts of Europe, and so the presence of cotton fibres in some of the skeins of yarn, not necessarily all, depending on where the spinning of each skein took place, suggests a medieval date for the drifting in of the fibres.The Cave of the Warrior textiles were woven on ground looms and one of the other textiles found there came from Egypt. At the most we can say the Shroud,if first century, must have been woven on a ground loom, which suggests Egyptian or possibly nomadic Bedouin manufacture- but then you can’t explain why the yarn was not spun in the native way with a S twist. The combination of a ground loom, a three in one herringbone and a Z twist is beyond any probability .When the Shroud could easily have been woven on a medieval treadle loom ( so the experts tell me), you are scraping the barrel a bit to find some esoteric loom and weaving process that somehow accounts not only for the Shroud itself in the first century but its miraculous preservation( but I suppose if it were a miraculous creation anyway none of this matters.)","date":"February 15, 2015 at 3:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"The most significant issue is that early Christians did not collect relics any more than Protestants do today. It was a contested area even in the fourth century, when relics were first accepted as a legitimate means of worshipping Christ, as it was contested in the iconoclasm era and at the Reformation. The idea of an artefact through which one could access Christ/God is only valid in some Christian traditions and abhorred in others. In the early Christian era it was simply not an issue- these were Jews,of course,in the earliest days. At the  Protestant Reformation they simply burned the lot. So why would they have saved the burial shroud that we do know of course, once existed in the first century?There are, as David Mo points out, immense difficulties in understanding how a linen of this size and weave and Z spin might have been around in Judaea in the first century to be used at short notice to wrap a body. So immense to my mind as to be beyond realistic probability. Even more difficult to understand is how a cloth such as this would have survived in this condition outside an Egyptian tomb. We only have a tiny, tiny proportion of medieval linens surviving  compared to the number we know from inventories to have existed in churches and as wall hangings in home. There is not a single medieval English painted linen still in existence. The trouble was that the painted surface disintegrated all too easily and the linen was thrown away if damp or fire had not got there first. So the problems of keeping a linen in good condition in damp areas for hundreds of years more is again beyond realistic probability. Two improbabilities multiplied together make the odds very long indeed.Historians simply have to make judgements. When experts in weaving tell me that the Shroud is a typical weave of a medieval treadle loom, I don’t take this as an absolute fact but I see no reason to dispute that expert opinion as there are no realistic alternatives.So gradually by eliminating improbabilities and imaginative solutions, one comes to a reasonable conclusion that is held until some evidence, ideally a first century carbon-14 date will do it, comes up to contradict it. As it is clear that a burial shroud of Christ did once exist, I shall be as interested as anyone if it is found, just as I would be if one of the large tomb blocking stones that still exist in Jerusalem is shown to be the one that closed Jesus’ tomb. That probably really does still survive in Jerusalem if only we could spot which one it is! It is said that the stone on which he was laid out, another likely survivor as it could hardly disintegrate or succumb to damp, was taken to Constantinople in the fourth or fifth century!I am not sure why the Shroud is talked about as if it were the greatest relic of all when all relic lists which have a hierarchy in them put pieces of the True Cross (the only relic of the Passion given a public showing each year in Constantinople), the Crown of Thorns (grabbed ,of course, by Louis IX for his Sainte-Chapelle) and, from the fourteenth century, the blood of Christ, higher up on the list than any burial shroud or sudarium.","date":"February 17, 2015 at 4:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Hugh, you need to look at journals such as, among those I have been put onto, Archaeological Textiles Newsletter and Medieval Textiles.

The legend went on that the disciples had gathered all these relics and made the chest themselves. The closed chest left Jerusalem c. 600, then made its way along the north African coast until it appeared in Toledo via Cartagena.Guscin has a go at all this but even he has to admit that ‘in these manuscripts [of the transfer of the relics] we are told that the ark left Jerusalem over the Mediterranean Sea, not overland, and that it entered the Iberian peninsula via the port of Cartagena. The curious thing about these manuscripts is that the sudarium does not appear in the list of relics, although it should also be pointed out that no two lists are the same in any document.’I can see why Hugh is getting confused!!! Was the sudarium there or not? It may be, of course, that a sudarium was not considered as prestigious as some of the other relics- certainly it would not have been more important than a piece of the Cross, but Guscin is hopelessly confusing over the relationship between the sudarium and what he calls the ‘ark’. He implies that the sudarium was somehow independent of the other relics but, without going back to my research, I think the story was that all these relics were together  in the chest from after the Crucifixion.There were all kinds of taboos about opening the chest and only in 1075 when king Alfonso VI was present was it opened and the relics discovered. I have no idea what happened to all the other relics but it is hard to know how all the pollen got into the sudarium when it was supposed to have been closed up in the chest. Still Frei was clearly a genius for discovering pollen from wherever it needed to be discovered!Guscin seems to believe that all these legends about the ‘ark’ which may or may not have contained the sudarium, represent some sort of historical truth. My own opinion was that they were typical of many other backstories developed to explain why a relic might be authentic and was just more interesting that some of the others which is why I put it in my book.Anyone who had a relic in western Europe had to develop a story of how it got there and there are lots of legends of boats setting out from the Holy Land and drifting to the coast of Italy or Spain (e.g the arrival of the bones of James on their way to Santiago is very similar). I think it is wrong to assume that the Oviedo one is more likely to be historically accurate than any of the others. Understandably as these stories were essentially made up they were discrepancies between them according to whom you listened to and, as Guscin recognised, this is an issue here. Of course, if you accept that these are legends then there is no historical problem involved – I was more interested in how similar the drifting boat legend  was ( the Volto Santo in Lucca arrived in the same way – or at least that was their story!!).And, for the sudarium- there is this little problem of the carbon -14 date of 700.I am sure someone will tell us when faidherbia acacia arrived in Palestine from its native Africa and at what time of year it pollinates – apparently beekeepers love it because it pollinates at a time of year when not much else does but I have no idea when this was in Palestine.

Then Margarite de Charny escaped with it and the reason that the Savoys were keen to have it was that  the duke of Savoy’s wife  Anne of Lusignan came from a family that had claimed stewardship of the holy places of Palestine as well as the crusader kingship of Jerusalem.All quite plausible, don’t you think?This is another of those backstories that explain why a particular family or shrine had the right to a particular relic and there must be hundreds if not thousands of them.

Plate 12 in Beldon Scott shows the Fascist Government’s advert for the ostension and he notes, p. 311, how Mussolini, flushed with success of the Concordat of 1929, saw it as a propaganda event to link the regime, the monarchy and the church. ‘Seizing the ostension as an opportunity to solidify further its advantageous positive rapport with the church, the fascist regime employed various means for advancing this goal’ and this included a fifty per cent reduction in train fares from Italian stations. As Beldon Scott goes on:  ‘In effect, a government subsidy, this arrangement encouraged pilgrimages to Turin, solidifying a mutually beneficial relationship between church and state’. The poster links the exposition to the royal nuptials ( Umberto was still Crown Prince at the time and the king did not even turn up.) Knowing how the press was controlled by the Fascists at this time, the 1.5 million may be no more than propaganda put out by the regime. I think Beldon Scott would have mentioned the crowds if they had been this big as they would have brought the city to a halt!We also have Peter Rinaldi’s memoirs (‘When America First Heard About the Shroud’, Spectrum, no. 12 Part 3) which notes that after he went back to the US after the 1933 ostension, no one had heard of the Shroud.The evidence does suggest, however, that the breakthrough to the Shroud as an international icon is in the 1970s following television broadcasts.

The problem with the de Charny’s was the refusal by the popes and then bishops to allow it be seen as authentic.e.g condemnation of Margaret de Charny for exhibiting it  by bishop of Liege in 1449. The Savoys tried to turn this around by claiming that the Lusignon family into which they had married had been given it by the Patriarch of Jerusalem in the eleventh century – all details in Beldon Scott.Meanwhile the shrine at Cadouin was on the way to Compostela and was packed out with pilgrims on their way there. It had the advantage over the Turin Shroud in that it had the actual story of having been brought from the Holy Land ,even though  since the 1930s we know it is an Islamic cloth made shortly before it arrived.2) You will find the details of the eighteenth and nineteenth century expositions in Beldon Scott. The Shroud used  to be exhibited as a relic on its feast day but after about 1703 it was only brought out at family weddings. In 1821 it was only exhibited in the cathedral ( when before it was shown in the open air in the Piazza Castello ) because of fears of demos against the dynasty, whose symbol it was, among liberals. There were only three expositions in the entire nineteenth century, 1842, 1868 and 1898. The 1868 was within the cathedral but only  for four days and  there is no record of many crowds as the dynasty had now relocated itself as kings of a united Italy. The lithograph that Beldon Scott reproduces from 1868 suggested that much of the paint from one of the images had fallen off by then but I leave it for yourself to view the lithograph yourself.3) The photos of 1898 did indeed go round the world but in the early 1900s the conservative Catholic Encyclopedia said that few Catholics thought it was authentic. There were complaints between the wars by authenticists that no one was listening to them. Things had moved on in the relic world.It was the television broadcasts in the 1970s which made it truly international and you get the creation of new , hitherto unrecorded, legends of an early origin which had, after the researches of Chevalier, to include Lirey again. These new legends have not found any support among medieval or Byzantine historians.If you don’t yet have a copy of Beldon Scott then they are available second hand and essential if you want to know e history of the expositions and the way the Savoys tried to manipulate and create a legend of authenticity which airbrushed the Lirey origin- especially after the ecclesiastical courts repeatedly proclaimed that it was not de Charny property in the first place!","date":"November 20, 2015 at 3:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/19/just-in-time-for-christmas-the-relic-master/","cat":"books","title":"Just in time for Christmas:  The Relic Master"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘ entire nineteenth century’ – after 1821, I mean.

They did not count the numbers of pilgrims at each shrine although sometimes they recorded the number of miracles and these were read out on the feast day of the relic in question. If you look at the evidence for the expositions of the Shroud you will find that it makes a very small impact before 1578, largely because it did not have a fixed base until brought to Turin. Overwhelmed as I was by the major cults of Europe in the Middle Ages, e.g. before 1500,  when I was writing my book on relics,I had no need even to include the Shroud as an also ran. It just did not feature among other more prominent shrines.I think Beldon Scott has enough details on the expositions of the Shroud to show that it was only between 1578 and 1703 that it had widespread popularity. I do not need to say more when anyone with an interest in the Shroud should have a copy of Beldon Scott to refer to- it is always the first book I recommend as it is the only one that relies on the original documentation in Turin and has a wonderful set of illustrations of the Shroud. One of the problems with the Shroud was the very small number of miracles associated with it- Beldon Scott  illustrates those known in the sixteenth  century but it did not, compared to some relics, have a healing tradition associated with it. Neither did it have a backstory ( e.g. The shroud at Cadouin was indeed brought back from the Holy Land) until the Savoys concocted their story of the Jerusalem- Cyprus- Lusignon connection by the 1580s. If we go back to 1517 de Beatis was actually given an earlier story that it was brought back from the First Crusade! There is nothing outlandish in referring to the cult of the Shroud, other than the period 1578 to c.1703, as a minor one before the 1970s. It appears that it was the international television coverage that brought so many, over three million, pilgrims to Turin in 1978. The single figure on the Shroud of Besancon did have a miracle of raising a man from the dead associated with it but I understand that many of the medieval sources relating to it were lost in a fire. The Shroud at Besancon, with its very different iconography ( e.g. no emphasis on the blood) ,and only a single figure, was, to my mind, another example of a Quem  Queritisceremonial burial cloth.The basic issue is that the number of pilgrims to a shrIne had nothing to do with the authenticity of a relic, unless it was of a recent saint. It is almost certain that the original stone that closed to the tomb is one of those apparently still to be found in Jerusalem but there is no way of knowing which one!","date":"November 21, 2015 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/19/just-in-time-for-christmas-the-relic-master/","cat":"books","title":"Just in time for Christmas:  The Relic Master"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"The Masada stitching proposal was put to rest in an earlier discussion on this blog.

There are second hand copies available on Abebooks.“The famed linen cloth preserved in Turin Cathedral has provoked pious devotion, scientific scrutiny and morbid curiosity. Imprinted with an image many faithful have traditionally believed to be that of the crucified Christ “painted in his own blood”, the Shroud remains an object of intense debate and notoriety yet today. In this illustrated volume, John Beldon Scott traces the history of the unique relic, focusing especially on the black-marble and gilt-bronze structure Guarino Guarini designed to house and exhibit it. A key Baroque monument, the chapel comprises many unusual architectural features, which Scott identifies and explains, particularly how the chapel’s unprecedented geometry and bizarre imagery convey to the viewer the supernatural powers of the object enshrined there. Drawing on early plans and documents, he demonstrates how the architect’s design mirrors the Shroud’s strange history as well as political aspirations of its owners, the Dukes of Savoy. Exhibiting it ritually, the Savoy prized their relic with its godly vestige as a means to link their dynasty with divine purposes. Guarini, too, promoted this end by fashioning an illusory world and sacred space that positioned the duke visually so that he appeared close to the Shroud during its ceremonial display. Finally, Scott describes how the additional need for an outdoor stage for the public showing of the relic to the thousands who came to Turin to see it also helped shape the urban plan of the city and its transformation into the Exploring the mystique of this enigmatic relic and investigating its architectural and urban history for the first time, “Architecture for the Shroud” should appeal to anyone curious about the textile, its display and the architectural settings designed to enhance its veneration and boost the political agenda of the ruling family.”","date":"May 23, 2014 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I am in Greece at the moment with no access to my files but a Belgian cultural institute analysed 400 C14 ratings of Coptic textiles and found about one per cent questionable.

And ,as we have noted in another discussion, she is supported by Professors Raes, Vial, Testore who have all examined this corner of the Shroud, so she is one of a GROUP of PROFESSIONALS specialising in ancient textiles who have actually examined this corner of the Shroud,not an isolated voice.Yes, for those who follow him, it is important to note that Wilson does not support the ‘reweave’ -he seems to be into contamination by clerical sweat, although one would assume that that would have been dissolved in the cleaning.

So did all the 46 fragments of wool damask from the Mons Claudianus site in Egypt (second century AD). A study of 21 linen textiles from Coptic Egypt from the Katoen Natie collection in Antwerp that have been dated to between the fifth and tenth centuries AD showed all had S twist yarns. A possible exception to the eastern S twist lies in the very finest cloths as in a (wool) diamond twill of the third century AD from a tomb in Palmyra (its weft had a staggering 160 threads to the centimetre) which was Z twist.In contrast the pre-Roman Celtic cultures of Europe all used Z twist. John Peter Wild, a leading authority on textiles, writing in 1970, knew of only one piece of linen from the Roman west that was S spun and as it was found with silks, it was probably an import. ( Wild’s Textile Manufacture in the Roman Northern Provinces, p. 44.) The wonderful silk damask from Milan of the fifth century is another cloth with Z twist threads. The ‘Roman’ Z twist continued into medieval Europe. For instance, all the linen textiles recovered in excavations from London that are dated between 1150 -1450 have a Z twist in their yarns. In general, therefore, a linen textile that uses a Z twist in its yarn is likely to come from Roman or medieval Europe, and a yarn with S twist invariably comes from the east. Now would you like to present your evidence to contradict this ‘coherent argument’?Please realise that some of us are professionals working in these fields and we do try and get things right before we go public.","date":"November 6, 2013 at 6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Dave b. I only intervened on one issue, the Z twist. When I first read it, I simply assumed that the author had got S and Z mixed. I do not know where he got his idea that Z twist indicated that the tunic ‘was probably made in the near or Middle East’ . A glance at a standard text, e.g. the first volume of The Cambridge History of Western Textiles would have shown him that he was wrong. It has long been recognised that Z is rare in the east, and S rare in western Europe.I do take the point,however, that there was trade. In fact, trade between the east and Spain has been plotted through the discovery of S twist textiles in Spain. Accounts suggest that the Temple priesthood in Jerusalem imported their linen from India or Egypt, there being little high quality flax in Palestine until the second century. So one can have an imported Z spun cloth in the east- I was simply making the point that ‘PROBABLY MADE IN THE NEAR OR MIDDLE EAST’ is certainly wrong. I did not intervene on the blood issue so that is irrelevant here.Obviously the fact that non-human primate species may have AB blood is neither here nor there as the species don’t cross. This is one of the areas that will be clarified over the years as more genetic evidence is accumulated.

That is up to Dan. Yesterday in the ‘Consider Rogers’ posting I put forward some areas of research (in the relic collections of northern France that are said to have come direct fromJerusalem)  that can be followed up without making a commitment either way to authenticity.

The people of Lucca love their Volto Santo but they simply say the original, authentic, relic is no longer there because pilgrims took pieces off it in the Middle Ages but the present, medieval one is a good substitute! Never forget that many of these so-called relics are objects of veneration, not authentic, but venerated because there are miracles associated with them. A miracle can always give a sacred object that may not be original at all special status.My own feeling is that Italians live emotionally with relics but disregard the science. They are simply part of the fabric of life associated with communal festivals going back, usually, into the Middle Ages and that keeps it all going.So far as I can see the booking for the Shroud visits is not being organised by the Church  but the local tourist authority.

Is there a hint here that Dr. Tite actually got hold of a fourteenth century cloth from a respectable museum, cut it into three and distributed it to the three radiocarbon labs and made each of them substitute it for the samples taken from the Shroud.  – I think you should ask Dan Brown, not my wife, about this.","date":"November 28, 2013 at 11:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/28/unraveling-unusual-stitches-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"books","title":"Unraveling Unusual Stitches in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"I never expected I would agree with Max on anything but yes here is a later fifteenth century depiction of Christ with the Crown of Thorns in place, blood on the hair under the Crown and flagellation marks covering the whole body and blood flowing on the arms – all very Shroud iconography.","date":"November 3, 2014 at 2:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Daveb. It is not a bias as such -it is just sorting out what is relevant or irrelevant. The Shroud is high quality- certainly not as high as other known examples e.g. medieval table cloths or altar cloths -but woven by professionals so one would EXPECT that the stitching would also be done by professionals. No surprises there. Flury-Lemberg simply confirms, and it is helpful to have her confirmation, that the stitching is in line with the professional quality of the weaving.Mrs. Charles Freeman can only work from the illustrations given by Wilson and the Masada report- she certainly does not see this stitch as complex so far as a professional seamstress is concerned because it the standard one used in these cases -but it is good to see that it is not a botched job in this case!!. As my wife, who is playing an unexpected starring role here, continues: The sentence ‘The linen cloth of the Shroud of Turin does not display any weaving or sewing techniques which would speak against its origin as a high quality product of the textile workers of the first century’ could be rewritten as ‘The linen cloth of the Shroud of Turin does not display any weaving or sewing techniques which would speak against its origin as a high quality product of the textile workers of the twenty- first century.” The question we need to ask the ‘history of stitching’ experts- and Gian Marco Rinaldi seems to be able to help here- is whether we could replace ‘first century ‘ and ‘twenty-first century’ by textile weavers ‘of the medieval period.’ if we can,then we are simply back to saying that, other than confirming that the stitching was professionally done, it could be of any date from the first century onwards. This is why I  think  the evidence of the stitching can be discarded as irrelevant for dating purposes. If there is no evidence that this form of stitching was ever known in the Middle Ages then we do have something of relevance to work on. So over to anyone who knows about the history of stitching to tell us.","date":"November 29, 2013 at 5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/28/unraveling-unusual-stitches-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"books","title":"Unraveling Unusual Stitches in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"P.S.

It is clear from Wilson that the actual stitching that he is referring to is Fig 23 in the Masada report even though he provides no reference that pinpoints this. I assume that he is correct in saying that this is the one that Flury-Lemberg pinpointed but he does not provide a reference to any conversation of text so we cannot follow it up.What I cannot find any support for is Wilson’s assertion that ‘the excavators adjudged this to be a very unusual seam’. I have read through the section in which they discuss the stitching and fig.23 is presented as one of the six examples of stitching they choose to highlight  with an illustration as typical but nowhere do they say that it ‘very unusual’ .Today that stitch is a standard one,immediately recognised by my wife from the Masada figure as the same  one used when two cloths are sewn together today. Common sense  (not always the best guide) would suggest that this same stitch has persisted throughout history until today as it serves the simple purpose for which it was intended and there is nothing fancy or unusual about it. So if the fig.23 counter-hemming stitch is the same stitch used on the Shroud it is simply saying that the Shroud stitchers used a conventional stitch and this does not tell us anything about the date that they did it. There is certainly no evidence that  this kind of stitch disappeared throughout the Middle Ages and then popped up again in exactly the same form as in Masada just in time for my wife and her fellow seamstresses to use it as one of her standard stitches. I suspect it has simply gone being used throughout history as the easiest way to achieve what needs to be achieved when two cloths are being joined.My own feeling is that this stitch evidence gets us absolutely nowhere and like the cubits is just one of those bits of deadwood that need to be discarded as research on the Shroud moves on.","date":"November 28, 2013 at 5:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/28/unraveling-unusual-stitches-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"books","title":"Unraveling Unusual Stitches in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"‘ The Turin Shroud is the most important and studied relic in the  world.’ We often seem to read this but there has been actually a great deal more intensive research directly on the fabric and images ( writings,inks,etc,) of the Dead Sea Scrolls than of the Shroud and it has been undertaken by top- level specialists in the relative disciplines.

The key skill lies in getting as thin a layer as possible so you could still use the cloth as a flag or whatever.   There has been an explosion of technical material on painted linens in the last ten years, a lot of it on how sophisticated the paintwork was with mixes of different pigments, layer upon layer, on the few survivors we haveAs years go by, anything coming from either McCrone or STURP is likely to be so dated as to be increasingly irrelevant. When professors reading the STURP reports today find them completely inadequate, then we know we need to move on. And one always has to remember that STURP did not provide a shred of scientific evidence that suggested that the Shroud was earlier than the medieval period.I quoted in earlier postings the essay on the York painted linens that told how easily the surface paint disintegrated- unless they were later placed on a board backing these linen paintings had a very short shelf- life- linen was hardly high class compared to the wonderful silks and other cloths that were produced in quantities for aristocrats and so most were soon thrown away when the painted surface began to crack up. This is why, the expert opinion is, we do not have a single surviving painted linen from medieval England.We are all agreed that the Shroud needs more close up examination. What we do have now is a wealth of new material on how linens were prepared for painting and painted on since 1978 ( I.e. from close-up examinations of the survivors rather than just relying on thee medieval texts) that has not yet been transferred into Shroud studies ( e.g. The results of the Zittau Veil restoration were only published in the mid- 1990s and then only in German- with a shortened English version in 2000). So once we do get another chance to examine the Shroud there will be a lot of new expertiseto apply to it – and one would hope that the Turin authorities would only employ people who do have this expertise. I am surprised that they did not take the opportunity during the 2002 ‘restoration’ as a lot of these issues could easily have been sorted out then.","date":"January 10, 2015 at 4:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Russ, the skill of applying gesso was so as not to make the cloth rigid, that is why it is only applied on the outer fibrils of the cloth. If it went below the surface it would create a rigid cloth , as if it had been starched. Is would make it impossible to use painted linen as a flag or banner?STURP reported a frosty appearance to the surface of the the Shroud, found large quantities of calcium carbonate which is to this day used in making gesso. So we have good circumstantial evidence of an original gesso. A further close-up examination is needed.What has to be explained is why the liquid on the Shroud,e.g. The bloodstains,did not not  go into the capillaries of the fibres. This is easy to explain if the cloth was gessoed as it was just this dispersal that it was designed to prevent. It is more problematic to explain other reasons why the bloodstains show no sign of dispersal along the capillaries but no doubt someone has an explanation. I haven’t seen much focus on this issue but it is a central one if you are trying to explain the images. The images are not just on the outer fibrils only- they have not dispersed along those outer fibrils. This is compatible with gesso as applied in line with Cennini’s instructions ( early fifteenth century although ,as he was writing in Tuscany , they tended to used calcium sulphate for their gesso ,not calcium carbonate which was used north of the Alps.) lots of work still to be done.And there has been the suggestion made to me by a physiologist that what STURP thought was  human blood was, in fact, compatible with animal proteins but I am not qualified to make any judgement on that.

It is obvious that you cannot paint on unsealed linen and it is hard to see how an actual body placed on an untreated linen would not put its sweat,blood ,etc, into the linen capillaries.

It was evenly distributed over the entire length and width. I wondered in the world it could have come from. It was not concentrated in the image areas, so it couldn’t have anything to do with paint, dye or stain’.This is all compatible with the sealing of the entire surface of the Shroud before painting had begun.2)From ‘Technical Observations on the so-called Grosse Zittauer Fastentuch’, in Villers (ed.) The Fabric of Images, London, 2000, p, 103. ( A must-have book if you are discussing medieval painting on linen.)The Zittau Veil is important as parts have the original paint and parts have lost it leaving shadowy images similar to  those on the Shroud.‘The paint did not soak through the fabric and only a few spots of colour can be seen on the reverse between the yarns. Clearly the canvas [it is plain weave linen] must have been prepared with a glue size coating or priming layer and, in fact, protein was detected among the canvas fibres. Technical examination has confirmed the use of such preparatory layers in the Middle Ages . ..  the technical treatises describe a range of preparatory applications to the canvas and not just glue size. The Nurnberger Kunstbuch (first half of the fifteenth century) mentioned a size described as stercken (Impregnating) applied with a bath sponge to both sides of the canvas. Alcherius/ Coene described a preparatory layer for gilding, painting and drawing on fabric supports containing gypsum with Armenian bole bound by parchment or leather glue. . .’(They go on to describe other sizing materials before going back specifically to the Veil)‘ On the Zittau Lenten Veil both a size coating and a priming layer have been found. In all cross-sections the size can be seen lying directly on the fabric support [N.B.], covered by a thin ground containing chalk [ ?calcium]  with a proteinaceous binder. This chalk is particularly finely ground . . .As this ground was found in all cross -sections examined, it is assumed that it was a uniform coating [cf. Heller’s account on the calcium on the Shroud] . . .The ground successfully reduced the absorbency of the fabric and prevented the paint from impregnating the weave.

What I have provided is a mass of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the Shroud was sealed ( e.g. the image is one the outer fibrils only) as is typical of medieval painted linens (see my other posting),with the pigments now decayed, leaving only the shadowy images ( compare the images on the Zittau veil). The decay of the images is symbolised by the contrast between the enormous crowds able to see the images in the seventeenth century and the close-up viewing needed today. As you may know one of my points is that we should be asking what the images were when the Shroud was originally created, not what they are now – this is the biggest wild goose chase of them all. We need to shift the whole focus of Shroud research and work on the depictions and descriptions from earlier times as one would normally with any artefact of this nature. (Why is the Shroud outside the normal approach to ancient objects?)Part of the circumstantial evidence is  the examination of the Heller -Adler papers by a professor of physiology who is not convinced by them and thinks that some of the findings are compatible with animal proteins ( this was his unprompted suggestion) and this would provide some evidence for a typical gesso mix. The professor has offered to pass everything on to a top haematologist but I have not taken this up. I will if there continues to be a challenge.As my posting on the Zittau veil showed there were many different ways of sizing (sealing) a linen cloth but the way in which the images are on the outer fibrils only are compatible with such a sizing and there are lots of other examples, now tested, that could be examined as a comparison with the Shroud. Calcium carbonate or sulphate is an ingredient of such sizing to this very day.So we need to broaden out research by looking at comparative examples- it irks me when people say that the Shroud is unique and then i discover that they have never studied anything about medieval painted linens (as STURP openly admitted they had not!!). The Shroud may or may not be a medieval painted linen but it has many features that suggest that it is one whose images have decayed and to dismiss these out of hand is not serious scholarship. It is the most likely hypothesis for the images and it remains number one until someone provides something better- so it is over to those who can provide a coherent alternative.","date":"January 13, 2015 at 5:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"We do have to draw on all the new  expertise arising from the growing interest by specialists in painted linen cloths.

In fact, when I had my article checked by one of the Byaantine scholars mentioned, I was asked why I bothered to respond to someone who had absolutely no academic qualifications in this field. Wilson admits that he cannot even read Byzantine Greek.Markwardt’s thesis rests on. ‘an awesome icon’ he finds referred to in Antioch. By this period icons of Christ were quite common so there is no reason what this particular  one should have anything to do with the Shroud. In fact it would be very unlikely. As it was not until the eighth century that Christ was ever shown dead so this ‘awesome icon’, like the Image of Edessa, would be of Christ when alive.  So the basic plank in Markwardt’s theory collapses.As many authenticists are only interested in the Shroud, they fail to recognise that images of Christ were common, in the Roman catacombs from c. 250, with the first bearded Christ’s recorded in Rome in about 300 and then in the east the images of Chirst in the Dura- Europus church of c. 240 ( assumed by some experts to be the earliest representations of all). If whenever an image of Christ is mentioned it is assumed to be the Shroud then we would have fifty or sixty alternative histories!Why not start with some of the ones in Rome- you can easily construct a history in which Peter takes the Shroud with him to Rome and that is why the first images of the bearded Christ are seen there!! Even more so as we know that many relics from Rome were taken up to France.

Of course, they must do some study of the Shroud but it is vastly more important that the Shroud is compared with other cloths and relics and not treated as if it were somehow unique. Many features of the Shroud can be compared to similar ones found elsewhere but this is an area where the research has hardly begun.I was interested in an article I read on painted linens some time ago ( I think it was from the later 1980s or early 1990s) when the author just mentioned, in an aside, the Turin Shroud as a typical medieval painted linen as if there was no argument about it.

I remember reading it in an article in a journal I was not able to take out of the Cambridge University Library!There were three-in-one herringbone silks in the third century AD – one was found as far east as Palmyra but they were all in silk and so very upmarket from humble linen. The V and A three -in-one is the only one I know in linen other than the Shroud. On your earlier posting:‘If the Shroud was much brighter and clearer than it is now, Charles needs to explain how such a uniform disappearance of pigment might have occurred, the apparent absence of any protein to bind the gesso, and the faint images that appear in copies’ I don’t think the disappearance of the pigments would have been uniform. A clue to why not can be seen from the depiction of the exposition of 1868 by Ferdinando Perrin, reproduced on page 296 of Beldon Scott (I assume that all you keen Shroud researchers have got your copies of Beldon Scott by now!). Perrin shows the dorsal image pretty complete but the frontal image as virtually invisible from the waist down-in fact it begins to fade from the shoulders down. I take these depictions with caution- you really need to have several ones by different artists to compare against each other- but it is hard to know why Perrin painted so faded a frontal image but a much more intense dorsal image if this is not what he actually saw in 1868. It is also interesting that the 1868 exposition –the last for thirty years- was the first one in which they placed the Shroud in a frame and kept it within the cathedral. In 1842, the exposition before, it was still being held in the open by the clergy from the balcony at the Palazzo Madama. So what had changed? Had there been a marked deterioration of the pigments as apparently recorded by Perrin? Perhaps we can get into the cathedral archives for the mid-nineteenth century. . . .Lots of further work to be done here.‘The apparent absence of any protein’. Below is what Mike Spyer said when he had read the Heller/Adler papers.‘The studies are all equivocal and would in my view fail to distinguish from the presence of other human or animal materials. There may well be proteins etc.’So we certainly cannot rule out animal proteins. It is clear from what Kelly has said that there is a lot of confusion over this issue and certainly it seems difficult for anyone to be committed to the certainty of human blood any longer. Perhaps we have moved on here.Faint images in copies. Yes, but this is vastly outweighed in numbers by all the depictions and descriptions of the Shroud that remark on the intensity of a Shroud that seemed to attract very large audiences (compare today’s single file close-up). We MUST have a database of all these depictions, descriptions, copies, etc with open access to scholars, before we can move further on this one. We have to define the features of the Shroud that are seen again and again in past depictions but are now missing, the long hair at the back (not a pony tail), the gap between the elbows and sides of the dorsal image (making it impossible for these to be the same arms as those of the frontal image), the thumbs which are usually shown jutting out at the same angle by different artists, the Crown of Thorns (that is also mentioned in descriptions) . . .The loincloth, probably added after 1563, is an interesting historical titbit. I was interested to read in Villers, ‘The Fabric of [medieval] Images’ that they did repaint linens that they valued.Serious research on the Shroud has scarcely begun- so much time has been wasted going down dead ends and ending up saying it is a mystery. Yet the more I talk to professional weavers, the more I hear that a cloth of this size, pattern and length is typical of a medieval treadle loom. (The sixth widths of the treadle loomed Zittau Veil make up 6.80 cms in total – do the maths for yourself to establish the average width of the linens and forget about Assyrian cubits! Even today one of the standard widths of a treadle loom is 45 ins.)  Remember we have to fix the origin of the weave before we need to worry about the origin of the images. On origin we also have to explain the Z twist in the yarn.But at least we are debating relevant issues.","date":"January 14, 2015 at 11:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"David.

No one would have been taken in by a cloth with images on it when none are mentioned in the gospel sources. That is perhaps why the Cadouin Shroud, with its historical background in the Holy Land (actually an Islamic cloth), pulled in the pilgrims over centuries and outclassed the Shroud until the Savoys got it and (in my opinion) realised that with the images as they existed then, they could exhibit before mass audiences.Thanks for your (Spanish) comments on my article.","date":"January 13, 2015 at 7:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/13/smithsonian-channel-is-it-the-greatest-prank-ever-pulled/","cat":"video","title":"Smithsonian Channel:  Is it the greatest prank ever pulled?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"We writers live in a free world and I have written many books and I have had everything from abuse to praise- but always continual work from respected sources, the last three publications by university presses..

It is a new one on me but I suppose one could have retting in a limestone area- even though flax was not always prepared by retting but by putting out in the sun. I do want to know of other known examples before I buy this one- otherwise it is just possible that it was dreamed up by someone . . .. It was STURP who suggested calcium carbonate but it is quite possible that they got it wrong. It can be calcium sulphate, of course- it varied from one part of Europe to another with the Alps the divide between c carbonate (north) and c. sulphate ( south). And there were other ways of sizing but ‘large’ quantities of calcium (STURP/Heller) did catch my eye.The image is on the outer fibrils only.

One must also remember, as I do recount in my book Holy Bones, that there were indeed pagan ceremonies of veneration of the bodies of heroes and Christians followed pagan rituals here ( see Ramsay MacMullen’s The Second Church).  I would certainly not see these as uniquely Christian relic cults in the way that such cults developed from the fourth century onwards.The earliest relics from the life of Christ and the Virgin Mary are not recorded until the fourth centurY and even then were contested as relevant means of worshipping Christ. The earliest mention of Helena’s discovery of the True Cross is 395. All the fourth century legends/ accounts talk of relics hidden since the Christian Era being discovered for the fIrst time then. There were later legends giving relics of the Passion,,etc, an earlier history but scholars see these as legends. It is interesting to read how Augustine at first rejected miracles through relics but over thirty years came to accept  them .Many ChristIan churches, including the early church, have survived without relics.

Not only has he discouraged research in alternative routes of the Shroud to Lirey but ,through the rIdicule he has earned from Byzantine scholars ( as you will find if you actually talk to scholars working in this complex field of Byzantine relic texts), he has discredited Shroud research in general.P.S.If you happen to believe that de Clari saw the Turin Shroud in the Blachernae Church, then you need to research the origins of that relic  collection.

McCormick uses the evidence of relic collections in northern France that survive with their original tags attached to show that there was an early trade in relics between the Holy Land and France.  These relics include those from the ‘Lord’s Tomb’’In addition to the northern French collections at Sens and Chelles, McCormick provides a text from the ninth century abbot of St.Riquier thanking the pope for sending him relics. After acknowledging the gifts from Rome he goes on to talk of his relics from other sources: ‘from Constantinople and Jerusalem, by the ambassadors sent there by more Lord [the pope], and next relics sent to us from Italy, Germany,Aquitaine, Burgundy and Gaul by the most holy Fathers.There was, in fact, a busy trade in relics along documented routes, one of which was from Jerusalem to Constantinople in the years before Jerusalem fell to the Arabs.Constantinople. I attach a short extract from Holgar Klein- the expert on relics in Constantinople, from his’ Sacred Relics and Imperial Ceremonies at the Great Palace of Constantinople’ – found online on Holgar Klein’s website. He gives many more examples of relic transfers but Jerusalem to Constantinople was the obvious one, attested as early as the 320s when Helena sent Constantine relics.‘Apart from relics intended for private use and possession by members of the court, there were others that should develop a more prominent profile. One such relic arrived in the capital from Jerusalem around 421.45 Granted in exchange for an imperial gift of money for distribution to the needy and a golden, gem-studded cross to be erected on Mount Golgotha, the archbishop of Jerusalem sent the right arm of St. Stephen to Constantinople, where it was received with great honor and deposited in a small church, newly built by the emperor’s sister Pulcheria Augusta inside the Great Palace (fig. 1).46 Further relics of St. Stephen arrived in the capital in 438. As recorded by Marcellinus Comes, they were brought back from Jerusalem by the emperor’s wife Eudokia and deposited in the church of St. Laurence, another church associated with the name of Pulcheria.47 Earlier the same year, on 27 January 438, Constantinople had celebrated the arrival of the relics of St. John Chrysostom, whose body was brought to the capital from Komana, the city of his exile.’You, as a scientist, might believe that Wilson is a professional.

Sceptics are sceptics because they don’t believe that the evidence that the Shroud is first century stacks up. We are happy to follow the evidence where it leads and so would be among the first to welcome any new radiocarbon dating.If you have been keeping an eye on debates you will know that every one of your assertions has been disputed. As yet no textile expert( and Marino, Benford and Rogers had no professional background in textiles) who has examined the Shroud close up has ever found any evidence of any reweaving.You are free to respond to the arguments put forward in my article on the Origins of the Shroud. Where they have proved convincing to many is that they provide interlocking evidence for a medieval origin, e.g. The all over scourge marks on the front and back of what are two different bodies( the length of the arms do not match each other) is only known after 1300, and actually  give a more precise date than the radiocarbon dating but is smack in the middle of it.I was told that the aragonite from the feet had been lost- anyone know where it is? If you go around losing what you consider your best evidence, then really you should not be working in this specialist field. It would seem to be similar to the calcium carbonate that STURP found all over the Shroud samples which is indicative of the gesso mix that seals a linen before it is painted on. But untile we find it we cannot make the match- that is assuming that STURP will allow access to the calcium carbonate they collected.Incidentally I, like many others, stopped communicating on the  International Sceptics forum. There was only one defender of the authenticity of the Shroud and he was unable to answer  the direct questions put to him so what was the point of continuing.","date":"October 29, 2015 at 3:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/28/banding-proves-cloth-was-not-repaired/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Banding Proves Cloth Was Not Repaired?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Thomas- the length of the arms. One of the most important tasks  still to be done in Shroud research, and one which can be done without access to the Shroud, is to create a database of all the known depictions of the Shroud. Obviously some are more accurate that others so you need to look for features that different artists in different contexts recorded. What is clear is thatis that originally there was a gap between the elbows of the back image and the main part of the body- it is shown again and again by different artists who were recording expositions.Now, in the privacy of your own home, lie on your back and recreate the same pattern.  You will see that you are a long way off being able to cross your arms in the front as shown on the front image.

What is important Is the very high rate of disintegration of painted surfaces and the work that experts need to do is to assess what discolouration of the linen takes place when gesso and pigments  have lain over the surface off a linen and then disintegrated. The Zittau Veil images, which also lost their pigments, suggest a discolouration of the linen very similar to the Shroud.As I always say, lots of work still to do but it will have to be done by those with more relevant specialist expertise on painted  linens that I certainly don’t have.","date":"October 29, 2015 at 1:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/28/banding-proves-cloth-was-not-repaired/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Banding Proves Cloth Was Not Repaired?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Well, Hugh, as you know I have been very interested in the iconography of the images and keeping an eye on all the early descriptions and depictions of the Shroud.  The two body images are not, of course , of the same body. You can see this from the way the arms don’t match (note the gap between the elbows and the body on early depictions which could not match the crossed hands on the front)  -they were painted ( in my view) separately and this also explains why the two bodies are different lengths. A slapdash painter?? What has particularly interested me lately is the way that the hair at the front does not fall back as one would expect. Yet in any normal work of art it does ( e.g. Giotto in the Arena chapel, in sculpture). Interestingly there are also epitaphioi where the hair of the corpse with crossed hands is also rigid and does not fall back so there may be a link there. (See the epitaphios of King Uros II Milutin of c. 1300, now in the Museum of the Orthodox Church in Belgrade,as an example.) There is an interesting art historian, Anne Derbes, who does argue that western artists did use Byzantine motifs at this period.  Lots more research to do here and the Holy Graves of the fourteenth century Rhineland also seem to provide some examples close to the Man on the Shroud.I still think the Holkham Bible of 1330 is the closest template we have to the Shroud,especially the pattern of the bloodstains and the naked body on the cross. I was intrigued to find that there is scholarly backing for the idea that the Holkham Bible was used as a template for artists. See the introduction to the facsimile edition by Professor Michelle Brown, formerly Curator of Illuminated Manuscripts at the British Library.None of this will seem relevant to this site as no one accepts that the  Shroud was once a painted linen. So,when I have time between other projects, I am just quietly getting my material together, knowing there is little point in sharing it here.So I am still on the painted linen, NOT a forgery, but produced for an Easter liturgical ceremony. I have yet to find a specialist medievalist who has shot me down so i shall keep on going! Like any real sceptic I am open to persuasion otherwise! it would do my relics book a great boost if we could find an authentic first century relic- but no evidence I have seen to convince me that we have.

There was lots of it around as importing raw cotton for manufacture into cloth was big business and linen and cotton weavers worked together and, as noted above, cotton threads and linen threads could alternate, as in a Milanese cloth where there was a ratio of twelve linen to three cotton warp threads. Lots of potential for cotton fibres to drift in and out of flax piles and then even, unwittingly, get spliced in ! So Raes’ claim of ‘not found in Europe” is not true of the Middle Ages and if his cotton did come in from a loom it is likely to be a medieval one.My personal view, and it echoes in a contribution by Hugh in another posting, is that there is simply not evidence of ENOUGH cotton, wherever it came from, to make a difference to radiocarbon dating.It will need a minute examination of the Shroud to find out in which other parts cotton fibres are present and, of course, these may well have come in from cotton coverings of the Shroud.","date":"October 22, 2013 at 4:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"author":"charles_freeman","post":"Maureen Fennell Mazzaoui, The Italian Cotton Industry in the Later Middle Ages 1100-1600, Cambridge UP, 1981 has it all including a chapter on cotton production in the ancient world.
