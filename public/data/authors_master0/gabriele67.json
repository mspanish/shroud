Or is he, more simply, a liar? The 1989 Nature’s “peer reviewed” (LOL!) article in which the results of the dating were published has a 31 instead of a 17.Well, that (intentional?) “small error” makes the magic possible and the Shroud becomes a medieval fake, even if with the lowest acceptable confidence level (as I know, even lower that the minimum acceptable, indeed).Be honest! Make the calculation again! Done? Got that 17? OK, put it where it should be (i.e., where those “scientists” put the 31) and, P-O-O-F!!, radiocarbon dating of the Shroud becomes worthless.Real scientists should be honest and surrender to evidence. Believe me, that man if everything but a scientist.","date":"November 7, 2009 at 10:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/10/20/richard-dawkins-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Richard Dawkins on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"gabriele67","post":"Radiocarbon dating contains an intentional error. A 17 was replaced with a 31 to reach the mininum acceptable confidence level (or a little less then the minimum, if you repeat the calculations with Calc.exe). With 17 che dating falls below the acceptable confidence level, so it is worthless.
