{"opinion":[{"author":"saddened","post":"It saddens me to see the things that define our existence what makes us who we are being questioned daily in life there are only two things that we all as humans know its truth and lies there is no magic in between. For many years now I have had a hole on my leg no doctor in the world has yet been able to explain why and how its there let alone why I am able to even walk. What makes it more strange is that there is no penetration on the surface of my skin yet under x-ray my leg tells a different story. With the naked eye nothing is visible it is only under x-ray that one sees the hole the size of a nail which pierced through my leg but left not a single scare yet it pierced right through the front though the bone and out the other side. All I know is that the same holes are on my hands and both my legs and I feel its time I give my self to the world and let the brains of the world see and figure out for themselves how a person like me has all these wounds yet walks and can lift objects with no effort. The secrets of my body defy all laws of life yet then again the question I want to know is am I the only one of 6 billion people on the place we call earth that has the wounds of the cross hidden from the naked eye. If any out there exists I call u to speak out I think we are meant to show the world our gift so that they can see what only kings dream to see. You cannot tell me that of 6 billion people on this planet I’m the only on human who has been asked to help carry the cross there must be others out there please let’s group up so the world can see our gift. The only thing I’ve been told is to turn to when christ returns will someone tell me what it means","date":"October 27, 2011 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/26/destroying-the-magic-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Destroying the Magic of the Shroud of Turin"}]}
