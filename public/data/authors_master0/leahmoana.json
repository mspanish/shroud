PLEASE dont you mistake it what other think they see.Optical illusion CAN WORK BOTH WAYS!Are Dan or You or Guscin or Schorwz Archaeoloical image analysts or cryptanalysts. Can you discriminate betwween false negatives and false positives? Between botanical or numismatical or paleaographical misreaidng and non-univocity? Etc. YOUR OPINION IS JUS AN OPINION NOT A FACT! Max, how does one become a cryptanalyst? Is there a course I can take? Online preferably. Textbooks? Can you name some other cryptanalysts who agree with your observations re: images on the Shroud? Since it is impossible for unqualified laymen like Dan or Hugh and I to peer-review your observations, we have no choice but to become cryptanalysts ourselves or seek the corroboration of those already trained in the field.","date":"October 13, 2013 at 9:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/13/gary-habermas-on-the-shroud-at-apologetics-conference-last-friday/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gary Habermas on the Shroud at Apologetics Conference Last Friday"}]}
