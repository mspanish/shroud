I try to remember that my faith is about my personal relationship with God not other peoples perceptions of Him. I’m so glad this book has brought you back to have a faith with Him.  You will not regret it.

I am glad that you are a born again Christian and your faith is a journey I hope you continue to look for the truth.Blessings James!","date":"February 1, 2012 at 2:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
