How could Jesus pose for a picture 300 years after he died?”     Both people mentioning this  – Sor Faustina and Sor Anna Ali, to whom Jesus appeared, are Catholic nuns.  “Let me tell you how I think he looked. In the Gospel, Judas identified Jesus with a kiss on the cheek. Why?”There is historical evidence of a letter from Pontius Pilate to Tiberius Cesar which totally contradicts what you are saying.  In the letter Pontius Pilate says that he would have known who Jesus was from the distance because he was taller and lighter than the people who surrounded him with their tawny complexions.   And he mentioned that He had honey colored hair and that he would have known who He was even if nobody had told him.The referred to letter is authenticated by Tischendorf, the great German historian.The Historic Search for the Face of Jesus is available on Amazon and Createspace, as well as many other books of hers.  The Passion and The Glory you may find particularly interesting.","date":"April 15, 2014 at 3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/28/new-book-by-dame-de-saint-simone/","cat":"books","title":"New Book by Dame De Saint-Simone"}]}
