{"art":[{"author":"dianna_montez","post":"How wonderful for this little boy and for this young girl to have been chosen as instruments to deliver the information God wants delievered to the people of this earth. My mother died at the age of 50. I met her doctor in the hallway at the hospital and he said that she was declared legally dead and that ” somehow” she came back. Upon speaking to my mother of her experience she said very matter of factly that she met and talked to Jesus and made a deal with him. She told him if he would give her more time with her children she promised she would never touch another cigarette again. She never did and he gave her 13 more years with her children. My mother was very child-like, innocent, and kind-hearted. She was born and raised in a tiny little country town in Louisiana. I am grateful for his mercy and the additional time he gave us with our mother. I am elated for Colton and Akiane, these beautiful young spirits, they get to live their lives with this incredible knowledge knowing that God hand picked them to deliver his message. What a gift they have been given! May God and Jesus watch over both of them and their families. Thanks to both of their parents for having the courage to share these incredible stories with us. It has renewed my faith in everything that I know in my heart is true. “We are never alone.”Lovingly,Dianna Montez","date":"June 20, 2011 at 8:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
