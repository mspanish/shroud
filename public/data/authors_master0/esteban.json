{"misc":[{"author":"esteban","post":"Hello. I’m from Argentina and I understand what the problem is.Here in my country there’re high schools that specialize in different areas (technical, industrial, sciences, economics), and they grant degrees like Technicians, Bachelor, and others.Universities usually give the technician degree (intermediate level) at 3 years and the Engineer degree (full degree) at five years.Between the High School degree and the College Degree there is another title called “terciary”, which does not depend on a University. We can choose if we want to go College or a Terciary High School.Pope Francis has a Chemistry Technician degree, and probably has the same knowledge as intermediate level from College. He didn’t went to the UBA. I don’t know if I would call him a Scientist but he has good knowledge in chemistry.(Sorry my english)","date":"March 18, 2013 at 12:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/16/the-making-of-a-meme-pope-francis-scientist-not-or/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Making of a Meme:  Pope Francis, Scientist.
