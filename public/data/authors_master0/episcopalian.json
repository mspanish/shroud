And then we have John and Rebecca Jackson suggesting that it was a tablecloth, and not just any tablecloth, mind you, but the tablecloth used at the last supper. And then, too, we have John Lupia suggesting it was a Jewish tallit. One thing that challenges but doesn’t disprove these speculations is the side strip. It seems apparent that the cloth’s loom width was reduced by cutting it near one edge and reattaching the selvedge. Linen was used for many purposes. We have references to linen curtains in the temple and it quite plausible that drapery was used in homes, particularly the homes of those who could afford such luxury. And we can certainly suspect that linen may have been also used as bed cloths. Stephen, your point about having to obtain the cloth in a hurry is well taken. It could have been a piece of linen from the marketplace intended for any purpose. Indeed, as clothing, it may have been a himation, which is what John of Damascus called it several centuries later. But it could also have been, as I speculated, an upscale burial shroud given that there were other upscale qualities to some of the tombs and ossuaries.","date":"February 3, 2010 at 8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/02/02/the-gibson-study-really-says-nothing-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"The Gibson Study Really Says Nothing About the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"episcopalian","post":"Exactly!","date":"September 22, 2010 at 9:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/22/trial-of-the-shroud-of-turin-at-newman-university-in-wichita/","cat":"history","title":"Trial of the Shroud of Turin at Newman University in Wichita"},{"author":"episcopalian","post":"And I would welcome a review of the book on this site if you would be willing to act as a guest author for that purpose.","date":"March 12, 2010 at 6:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/02/02/the-gibson-study-really-says-nothing-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"The Gibson Study Really Says Nothing About the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"episcopalian","post":"John and Ellen:John, Ellen did not accuse you of anything.

The big piece of cloth with two life-size images, front and back, of an apparently crucified man was not—could not be—the burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. Science had just proven that.  It originated, so the scientists said, in the Middle Ages sometime between 1260 and 1390, or thereabouts.Two decades later, people are still trying to prove the Shroud is fake. And we should wonder why. One reason is that the carbon dating has been shown to be invalid. Ray Rogers, who had accepted the carbon dating, decided to disprove a crazy explanation from what he called the lunatic fringe. The crazy idea was that the Shroud had been mended and the samples were from that mending job. What Rogers discovered was that the crazy idea seemed to be right. He concluded that the sample used for carbon dating was not representative of the cloth. It was chemically different. Moreover, one of the chemical differences, the amount of vanillin, provided a new clue about the cloth’s age. Samples from the main part of the cloth, unlike the carbon 14 sample area, did not contain any vanillin. If the shroud was only as old as the radiocarbon date, it would have plentiful vanillin.  The Shroud was at least twice as old. It might be 2000 years old. After a lengthy peer review process, his findings that the carbon dating was wholly invalid were published in the scientific journal Thermochimica Acta. This was also confirmed by John L Brown, a forensic materials specialist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia and by Robert Villarreal and a team of nine scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Additional articles appeared including one in Chemistry Today that showed that the sample used was completely invalid. One of the claims by proponents of authenticity is that even with modern technology, no one has been able to reproduce the images. British physicist Philip Ball repeated pointed this out in Nature. While true, it doesn’t mean that someone won’t figure it out, someday. But that is not all. Several historians argue, I think correctly, that history strongly suggests authenticity. The arguments are about as good as most ancient history gets. Even so, definitive proof is elusive. Case closed is simply not the case. Also, you should be aware that many true believers, primarily fundamentalist Christians, DO NOT WANT the Shroud to be real.","date":"March 27, 2010 at 10:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/shroud-of-turin-shows-another-mystery-face/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Shroud of Turin shows another mystery face"},{"author":"episcopalian","post":"Barry, I don’t mind that you are an Atheist.
