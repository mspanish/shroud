But from what I know they are usually in a symmetrical or at least artistic pattern, not the assymetrical / non-artistic patterns seen on the HPM. And they are usually a lot larger than the tiny holes we see on the HPM. De Wesselow who is an EXPERT in things art historical supports these views (which I would note I have personally held for years).Please explain your objections to this.– Please explain why, if the object is a tomb lid, that there are two red lines which look very much like depictions of blood. Note these are next to the central cross-filled area of the object which I interpret as symbolising the body image on the shroud (which if true would have blood to just one side of it, and L shaped holes just to the other side of it, like the Shroud.) I don’t know of any precedence for a blood covered tomb lid.– If the cloth on top of the object is the Shroud, then it is very small. The artist is not that gifted, but I’m sure if it was the Shroud he would have made it look closer to full body shroud size. Rather it appears to be the size of a face covering cloth, in which case as per John’s Gospel account we would also expect to see the Shroud. And in fact we do here, because it is the object you think is the tomb lid. And the notion that the cloth is the head cloth is also suggested by the floating image of Christ’s  head nearby.

Yes.”No. A figure derived from a supposedly genuine image of Jesus must look a bit like him. Specifically, it must have a full beard and a moustache. If it doesn’t have those fundamental identifying characteristics, it cannot be considered the same man, regardless of the pose or the nudity.No. An artistic representation is always that – a representation. Especially in terms of an “artist” with the obvious limitations of the HPM artist, there will be limits on his ability to represent the shroud.Also it is not at all obvious that the Shroud Man’s beard is full and long. TO me, it is not really a big full bushy beard. Remember too that we have the benefit of digital enhancement, and photo negative, which they obviously didn’t have in the 1100s.    B) “May 4 fingers, without thumbs on both hands of Jesus on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.”No. Byzantine pictures often show people with no thumbs, but it was not until I studied David Mo’s selection that I realised how many. A third or so of his images show Jesus, and often others, with no thumbs. If the Pray manuscript may derive from the Shroud, then so may all the other Byzantine people with no thumbs, which is absurd.This is  a good challenge. But I don’t think you can so categorically say “No.”  C) “May cropped Jesus legs on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.”No. For a start we don’t even know if the image is cropped, and for a second the fact that both shroud and feet are cropped does not demonstrate any kind of connection between the Shroud and the Pray image. I consider this very far fetched indeed.I agree this isn’t the most convincing attribute. But again I don’t think it can necessarily be dismissed. I guess the artist may simply have run out of room and not planned the image properlyD) “May zigzag patern on HPM represent herringbone weave on TS? Yes.”No. I’ve explained why not, and do not need to go into it further.Again, your categorical dismissal is unjustified.  E) “May two red smudges on the rectangle on HPM represent blood belt on TS? Yes.”No. The blood belt on the shroud shows interlacing lines, the Pray lines are alongside each other. It is inconceivable that an artist would represent interlacing lines with parallel ones.I disagree with OK that these represent the blood belt. But I DO think they represent blood on the shroud, either in a generic sense, or possibly with reference to the streaks on each of the two arms.Absolutely no compelling alternative explanation has been put forward. “I don’t know” is not compelling.F) “May the four L shaped circles on the HPM represent poker holes on TS? Yes.”No. They are not on the Shroud but the Tomb.Again, unjustified dismissal. No convincing evidence has been presented arguing what these non-decorative circles could otherwise be.

They need to change to 12th century lenses.Firstly, picture what the shroud might have been like in the 1100s, if indeed it did exist then. It didn’t have the burn marks. It quite possibly had the poker holes. It quite possibly had the blood.I’ve seen the shroud with my naked eyes. It is far less defined than what we see in photographs. In fact I would call the image somewhat ephemeral, appearing more or less defined depending on the distance from the object.  Keep all these things in mind when you form your 12th century image of the Shroud:faint ephemeral image, conspicuous poker holes, no burn marks, conspicuous blood marks. Does the HPM image then start to make more sense?An indisputable FACT is that the “3 Marys” image on the HPM contains PLENTY of symbolism. This is demonstrated at the very least by features such as the head next to Mary’s right arm, and the floating character. This symbolic approach differs from the literal artistry of other images in the HPM. It’s as if the artist is saying: “The resurrection and its representation must be mysterious”. In this light, I see no problem in seeing a cryptic allusion to the shroud in the object we’ve all been debating: faint image represented by central crosses, framed on one side by two wavey red lines representing the blood, and the “L shaped” poker holes on the other side. If the artist was a senior cleric who visited Constantinople, then it’s no leap of faith to think that he might have seen the Shroud, and might then have been deeply impressed by it. It’s not then a big leap to think he might have alluded to it in his picture.Anyhow, that’s me on the HPM.","date":"June 29, 2014 at 5:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"thomas","post":"“The base rectangle conveys no impression of being intended to represent a casket, so much as a kind of slab or stone, perhaps even something like the limestone shelves seen in any of the Jerusalem tombs, by wandering crusaders.”It could possibly represent the red marble stone of unction, that was brought to Constantinople in 1180.

I had previously been of the view it might more generically signify weave. I’ve changed my mind. I think it represents a patterned lid.However…For now, I maintain the view that the Shroud IS alluded to in the work.

Red mark above the eye? Really just a coincidental mark?3. Shapely, almost feminine thighs? Another coincidental similarity?4. High chest5. Along with the asymmetrical 4 circles / holes, skeptics need to explain the two red streaks on the lower image. I think it is totally insufficient to just ascribe these as some sort of random decorative features. Neither make sense from that perspective.     6. Skeptics claim continuity with artistic tradition but there are several departures from artistic tradition (as mentioned above). A very curious departure is the ‘floating head’ next to the sleeve of one of the women, seemingly connected back to the shroud via a floating letter   / symbol. I really don’t know what this symbolises – I can hazard some guesses. At the very least, it shows a lot of symbolism in the mind of the artist – this artist is not one who simply wishes to convey literal depictions. This is very important when considering potential meaning behind the PM.  Points 1-4 can be argued as co-incidences. I accept that. Points 5 and 6, in my opinion, cannot be so easily dismissed.

It is atypical and almost certainly suggests the image was created by contact with an object (Jesus’s body if you are authenticist, or bas relief if not) rather than painted on. Why would an an obvious painting created for ceremony – as Freeman suggests – be then exhibited and venerated? Freeman suggests an association with a miracle as a possibility. I think it far more likely that it was exhibited as Christ’s true burial shroud or at least a representation of it, and its mysterious and unique ghostly image (totally unlike a painting) was part of its attraction. I have previously argued that the image was always faint, referring to a number of depictions from the 1500s that clearly attempt to depict its faint ghostly nature. I also argued that the bolder depictions do not prove that the image was once much bolder, but rather represent a less skilled depiction OR the artist’s desire to show the detail of the image rather than faithfully try to depict its faintness. Crowds go to see the ghostly image today so why not crowds in the 1600s. Why does its display and attraction of large crowds imply that the image was much bolder?I also struggle to see why a ceremonial prop as Freeman proposes would need to show frontal and dorsal images. Why depart from a tradition of just showing a frontal image? eg. the epitaphiosAnd the nudity remains a problem. Very rare indeed in depictions of Christ. Even in the 1300s the overwhelming majority of depictions showed Christ with loin cloth. I know of one or two small paintings, but am unaware of statues or large artistic representations used for public display / worship that show Christ without loincloth.

After all, it’s rather hard to the naked eye to make out any eyes within those eye sockets. It’s also a fallacy to consider that the Mandylion can’t be the Shroud because it didn’t show blood on the face image. There is always the potential for artistic licence, and then a tradition to build upon that artistic licence! And the cultural climate through the 800s, 900s and 1000s was ripe for a depiction that showed a non-blooded face. As we all know, the depictions of Jesus from this period were typically non-bloodied – Christ was glorified and all powerful, not the “suffering servant”!Some here who attack the Mandylion / Shroud connection believe that the Pray Manuscript is a representation of the Shroud. Yet the PM displays almost none of the bloodied Christ as we see on the Shroud. Look at some of the Shroud depictions. They didn’t always show blood on the face.They didn’t always show the scourge wounds. They often (but not always) showed a loin cloth (when that does not exist on the Shroud). They usually don’t show the “blood belt” . They sometimes do not show the “poker holes”. Does that mean they aren’t depictions of the Shroud? No!!!

Gospel of Mark likely dates from circa 70 AD and less than 40 years from Jesus’s death is nothing in that context (ie. people who would have been circa 15 – 20 years old when Jesus died would have been circa 55-  60 years old in 70AD)  Earliest letters from Paul date from the 50s and their content reiterate already well established knowledge and traditions around Jesus.Ex-biblical writings provide clear evidence of active Christian communities in the 50s – 60s AD. From what I can tell, the view that Jesus never existed is a very marginal viewpoint.  These writings come from a period very close to Jesus’s lifetime.","date":"January 7, 2015 at 11:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Seeing this reminded me of the abrasion we see on Christ’s right cheek on the shroud.

There is just not a shred of evidence for this.”Correct – there is no evidence. One can only speculate.However, one may reasonably ask why this significant change in art history occurred.Of course, there could be several reasons. One might think The Black Death in the mid 1300s might have had something to do with it, but this doesn’t stack up given the artistic changes started occurring circa 1300.  Personally, I think the changes were linked to the epitaphios, which started to appear around circa 1200AD – 1300AD and showed a more bloodied Christ than seen before.And that the epitaphios was influenced by the Shroud. I doubt the Shroud was in southern Germany in the the late 1200s, although it could have been. It’s worth reminding oneself of the geography of Europe around 1200AD. I found the very good map below. It shows how close Hungary was to the Byzantine Empire. And it wasn’t far from Hungary to Southern Germany….The Danube acted as an important trade route in the middle ages, and connected southern Germany, through Hungary, and out to the Black Sea:","date":"November 17, 2014 at 2:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/a-scorch-is-a-scorch-of-course-of-course/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A scorch is a scorch, of course, of course,"},{"author":"thomas","post":"I’m free like anyone else to put forward any theory I like.

And to that extent, I thinkyou are definitely barking up the right tree in terms of a medieval creation theory, far more than any other present researcher.However, I still have a number of problems, including but not limited to:– If the Veil of Veronica was the defining influence, why create a whole body front and back image? I’m struggling with this one. The artisan could have just done a bas relief scorch of the face. The legend is unequivocal in terms of the image being one of the face rather than whole body– I know you are deferring from coming up with precise technological explanations for the image, but this is still a hole for me!!!– I know you and some others don’t have a problem with the nudity, I still do!!!! If the image was created for the express purpose of public display / worship, then it defies the norms of the time for no loin cloth! I realise there is the odd image here or there (maybe less than 5% of total images?) that shows a nude Christ, however as far as I am aware they were discrete, small images used in a private worship or ecclesiastical context, not images for wide public display or use!!! And never buttocks on full display (Even the nude images manage to subtly hide genitalia and / or buttocks). I stand to be corrected.Was the artisan and his supporters so sophisticated to promote the Shroud along the lines of:‘We all know the loin cloth is a nonsense, and that Christ was wrapped in a shroud without also wearing a loin cloth!!”Assuming the apparent skill of the artisan in creating a bas relief or statue, then surely it would have not been difficult to craft a sculptural loin cloth?

If the variations in image intensity are due to distance from the cloth, as they seem to be, then this doesn’t make sense, as the cloth is touching both the eyebrows and forehead firmly…. On a typical person’s face eyebrows do not project far out.However, with a statue or bas relief, it would be natural to expect a slight raising of the eyebrow depiction, for effect.If the shroud was draped over a statue, then, the sculpted eyebrow feature projecting (as opposed to nearly flat on a real person) might explain slight lift away of the Shroud from the forehead.

But then you argue for an imaged (front and back for good measure) shroud to be held up in a ceremony as opposed to say a non imaged but bloodied shroud. I think this is logically inconsistent. Why show an imaged burial shroud ‘to show Christ had risen’ if there was no tradition of a full body imaged shroud?– the Shroud itself is of such length as to be quite a nuisance to ‘hold up’– why ‘manufacture’ a front and back image? A frontal image would have been enough and a lot easier to manage. Your theory suggests a purely ceremonial origin for the shroud but the ultra realistic front and back image flies in the face of this.– the nude image goes against the art history grain….yes yes there were one or two rare exceptions but they were discrete images not things for widespread public display. And sorry I don’t buy your argument at all that there was originally a loin cloth on the image that wore off.– I just don’t buy your argument that the image is the product of a faded painted image. For many reasons. A painted shroud makes sense for an Quem Queritis object, a novel and as of yet inadequately explained image does not (when a painted image would be all that was required for an abstract and symbolic ceremonial use)","date":"December 22, 2015 at 4:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Sad!

In my opinion though, I think it more likely that God is not all powerful but IS all-good. Just a belief, but also based on personal experience where I’ve experienced what I think is divine grace. I do believe in a ‘force’ (for want of a better word!) that permeates this world – God – that is the source of beauty, peace and goodness. Maybe this notion of God allows for a God that aspires towards the realisation of all these qualities and more but doesn’t always achieve it (ie. not all powerful).I don’t believe in a God who only answers some  prayers. I do believe in prayer though! – but not in the sense of ‘ask for and be granted/not granted’! more of a meditative sense of prayer.This notion is not far removed from that put forward by some Theologians who view God as the ‘Ground of Being’ rather than as an objective interventionalist being.

This image will naturally vary depending on the muscularity of the individual. In me, the slope of the trapezius is not as steep or as “bulky” as my brother, who is anatomically similar but works out at the gym a lot. To my eye, the image on the shroud is of a man who is not excessively muscular, but has generally quite well developed muscles. Whether such muscle development is consistent with the notions we have of Jesus???? If he did a reasonable amount of physical labour, then maybe its consistent. “the shape of them from the front does not match their shape from behind”A: This is explained by the tenting that occurred on the frontal image but did not occur on the dorsal image. Also, the trapezius muscle is basically flush with the back, but not with the front of the body.As your images show, there is not symmetry in the trapezius image between left and right sides. On the side where the top of the trapezius image is set slightly “lower”, there appears to be a correspondingly lower setting of the arm and hand on the same side on the frontal image. Maybe coincidence. Maybe not. I favour the view that it is not coincidence.A further comment :I’ve just noticed on Shroud scope the lack of scourge marks just below the neck on the dorsal image.

I’m yet to hear any convincing skeptical theories, however. Colin B has done some interesting experiments but has not (at least yet) come up with a bulletproof theory.I’ve done a lot of thinking over the last couple of years of alternate theories. About 2-3 years ago I thought of a genius alchemist working with substances and bas relief / statue. I also thought of the Shroud also being linked somehow to a flagellant in the mid 1300s eg. maybe the shroud was used to temporarily cover a dead flagellant. But that still raises the question of how the image may have been formed, if it did cover a dead body (whether medieval or from the time of Christ). I’m far from convinced as to the Maillard theory.     There’s plenty I don’t know and am happy to admit it. But I am very confident the image was created by an imprint. I don’t subscribe at all to any notion that the image was painted, such as advanced by Charles Freeman.Because the qualities of the image are certainly related to body / cloth distance.  I don’t cling religiously to faith in The Shroud  – it helps support my faith, but I’m very confident my faith would not fall apart if the Shroud was convincingly  shown to be a medieval creation.As it stands, I think at present the collective evidence across disciplines -notwithstanding the carbon dating – points to a date significantly earlier than the 1300s.I could still be convinced by a medieval imprint theory, but I’m waiting…In the meantime – and yes it’s unscientific – I believe the image was created by the miracle of the resurrection (and this explains the late carbon dating date). I don’t advance any radioactive theories etc. The resurrection being a miracle defies scientific understanding, so logically if the Shroud image was created by the resurrection then the image making process defies human explanation.

Otherwise you are like a lost sheep.”I don’t agree, I think it is quite obvious that the Gospels are a mix of fact and fable, or literal description and figurative / metaphorical text. There is a lot of research to back that up, and it would seem that generally speaking it is Christians of a fundamentalist nature who would believe every miracle story in the Gospels is literally true.  There are some who quite convincingly argue that the Virgin Birth is myth. I’m agnostic on the Virgin Birth. I think it could be myth, or literally true – or both. Because I believe in the resurrection, as a supernatural event, I believe it is logically consistent to consider that another miracle at the START of Christ’s life COULD have occurred. I think it’s a logical fallacy when Christians who believe in the resurrection (unless they believe it in some ‘metaphorical’ sense) say they cannot believe in the Virgin Birth because of its supernatural nature. Having said that the Virgin Birth stories have a lot of mythic qualities. But that doesn’t mean the whole story is myth – maybe it really did occur but was embellished within a mythic framework. I think the resurrection stories are similar, especially Matthew’s account which seems to be embellished with legendary elements.","date":"November 11, 2015 at 4:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"The Process of Resurrection"},{"author":"thomas","post":"This is nonsense","date":"March 28, 2014 at 2:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/27/mark-antonacci-on-local-st-louis-television/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Mark Antonacci on local St. Louis Television"},{"author":"thomas","post":"David Mo – the question is not necessarily whether or not medieval artists depicted Jesus with crossed hands and thumbs hidden.

Quite possibly this is due to the fact that they would have been a most conspicuous feature prior to the fire.This, I believe, provides a strong clue as to why they were shown in the Pray Manuscript – they were very prominent pre-fire and quite possibly attained symbolic significance.","date":"October 22, 2014 at 6:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"thomas","post":"So I ‘ve had a closer read of the article. Sorry, Charles did not advocate that the shroud was painted on from the start and then wore off, or was removed. He proposes it was artisticaltly added on, and then wore off. But as Eric suggests, there are big problems with this theory in terms of the lack of physical evidence.Far more likely that the loin cloth was just added in to the artistic impressions of the Shroud.I think its also a huge assumption to say that because the artistic impressions show the image boldy that this means that the real Shroud image was much bolder. It may have been bolder, but “that much” bolder?Far more likely, again ,that the images are that bold because the artists wanted to clearly demonstate the image.  And again, the Lier image moderately successfully illustrates a faninter type of image  -evidence that it was always rather faint, rather than boldy painted.","date":"October 17, 2014 at 7:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"thomas","post":"I think you miss my point – maybe I didn’t express myself clearly.You argue in the article that the artistic representations from the late 1500s – bold and clear as they are – suggest the Shroud image was much bolder at that time in the 1500s, and has since faded.My point was that the Lier image – made in the early 1500s – is clearly suggestive of an artist trying to represent the faint image that we still see today.Do you disagree? If so why? I think its pretty clear that the Lier image is trying to represent the faint Shroud image, with its various accents. Therefore the much bolder images of latter dates are not bold because the Shroud image was once much bolder and clearer. Rather, they simply indicate a lack of skill- or interest on behalf of the artists- in trying to represent the faint image. ie. it was the 16th century artist’s equivalent of us using digital enhancement today to better show the image.","date":"October 22, 2014 at 6:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Copies from 1568, 1634 AND IN PARTICULAR 1643 also strongly suggest that the image in the 1500s / 1600s was very faint even then","date":"October 22, 2014 at 6:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Fascinating Jos","date":"October 22, 2014 at 6:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"thomas","post":"I tend to agree with OK.

A very good example is that paintings showed flagellation wounds in very stylised ways as compared to the shroud eg. dots, or little trickles as we see in the paintings above.Similarly, many of the blood stains on the shroud display NO artistic styling – eg. side wound, wounds on feet, small of the back etc.One could argue that SOME of the blood wounds do – eg. head, arms.Something that is not often considered by people on either side of the debate is the possibility that some of the blood is “original”, and some was a “later addition”","date":"November 4, 2014 at 3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Is there any evidence to suggest Roman flagellation was universally brutal?Could there not be variations ie. from bone exposing  barbarism, to lighter Shroud-like scourging?Most forms of punishment have different extremes of pain and torture, should flagellation be any different?","date":"November 4, 2014 at 2:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned"},{"author":"thomas","post":"for me the lack of loin cloth is a bigger problem, assuming the shroud was created by an artisan / artist for public use / worship / display.the vast majority of art of the period has the loin cloth, and where it doesn’t it most certainly wasn’t art for wide public display or worship!!!!!!the presentation of the front and dorsal images are totally atypical, and Freeman hasn’t at all convincingly argued why a sheet with an image of the Crucified Christ used for worship – like the epitaphios – would need both front and back images.Despite his protestations, there are many problems with his article.I look forward to views from his ‘credentialed’ mates","date":"November 4, 2014 at 3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/03/the-holkham-bible-recently-much-mentioned/","cat":"books","title":"The Holkham Bible Recently Much Mentioned"},{"author":"thomas","post":"I am not a scientist.
