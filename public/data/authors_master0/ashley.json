I have never gone through anything like what you did. On some level I’m jealous. However, Christmas 2012 it is today, I felt a draw and decided to start looking for the young artist who was able to put Jesus on a canvas.

I appreciate your story.","date":"December 26, 2012 at 2:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
