{"art":[{"author":"theresa","post":"I have been telling everyone to read Colton’s story of “Heaven Is For Real.”  God chose this innocent child to teach all of us about Jesus, the heavenly kingdom, angels and our loved ones. How blessed are those that read this book and believe. I love Akiana’s paintings of ‘Prince Of Peace’ ,’ Father Forgive Them’ and ‘Mary with the baby Jesus in blue.’Quite simply she is amazing and her work is inspirational. Gazing upon Akiana’s masterpieces one feels a calm tranquil awe, especially in the aqua green eyes of Jesus. They are mesmerizing, deep and compassionate.The most amazing piece of the puzzle is that the shroud of Turin matches the art of Akiana.God the Father wants us to know the love of Jesus, believe and pray; particularly for unbelievers!We are so lucky to know that God has a divine plan and we are in the palm of His hands.Satan is busy in this world seducing so many that it is our obligation to pray for others, love one another by using our hands and feet to help, reach out and spread goodness. We are the light for others who are in darkness. I feel there is an urgency to reach the young people of the world plugged into 21st Century Learning who are bombarded with constant noise. They are unable to really hear God or see with their hearts! Let us pray, pray, pray.","date":"August 12, 2011 at 2:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"theresa","post":"I would love to think our beloved pets are in heaven, too.God created all the creatures as gifts for us.","date":"October 7, 2011 at 12:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
