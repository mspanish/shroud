The Rainbow Body adepts in the Buddhist tradition, the Tamil Siddhas in Hinduism and Enoch, Elijah, Moses, Jesus and  Mary in the Christian tradition (not to mention over 100 accounts of incorrupt bodies) all avoided “return to dust.”  How?  They took lifestyles of love (promoting happiness), compassion (eliminating suffering) and ascetic values to the extreme.  They walked the walk.  The words on Ash Wednesday, “….to dust you shall return” need to be modified to say, “….to dust you shall return, provided you so choose.” We are all spiritual entities seeking a human experience and not the other way around.  Death and decay are the result of the spiritual us being overly caught up in the material world causing us to lose our way.  As it turns out, the Essenes and Gnostics were right after all.Today’s faithful would categorically reject that message because it tampers with otherwise plush and  comfortable lifestyles and membership would decline as would the proceeds in the Sunday collection plate. But, the facts are the facts are the facts.  We all have free will and can have an opinion about anything one wishes to opine about.  But, you cannot have an opinion about fact.The human mind as a serious defect.  It can’t take a joke.  So, if you keep saying something over and over it will accept it as fact no matter how wrong it might be and the conscious self will act accordingly.  Politicians have known about this defect for eons and fully take advantage of it at the peril of the unsuspecting.  We need to stop accepting the certainty of death and decay. Death and decay are  alternatives, not fate.   Lets face it; Adam and Eve are corporate characters, it is  not possible to build a boat that will hold two of every creature (let alone find two of every creature) and God is not a man that lives up in the sky, having a son but not being married, and he does not have a super computer that keeps track of every deed, good and bad, that his subjects commit.  The sooner we admit to these things the better off the world will be. The first step is to stop saying it.  The only way to cure a broken leg is to recognize that the leg is broken.And, while churches may be full from time to time, the fact is in the U.S.  30% of the people raised Catholic leave the Catholic faith before their late 20’s. My impression is that a similar thing is happening in Europe.  Were it not for the influx of Mexican immigrants the US Catholic population would be in serious decline. On top of that,  almost 50% of those who claim to be Catholic practice the “cafeteria” version of the religion.  They freely choose their personal preference on a variety of key issues, such as Original Sin, abortion rights, gay marriage, Mary’s virginity, transubstantiation and even the divinity of Jesus.  About 40% of U.S.  Christians believe in reincarnation and another 25% remain open to the possibility.  The notion of Jesus’ second coming and the faithful being raised on the last day has been relegated to myth and metaphor. The Church has lost control of the congregation.The faithful speak proudly of the way the Church has held steadfast to its 2,000 year old traditions.  I stand disappointed, even embarrassed,  in front of my non-Catholic friends,  that this powerful institution has arrogantly refused to update its teachings and bring them inline with modern advances in Biblical scholarship,  archaeological discovery, quantum physics,  East-West dialogue and social understandings.   Ask the Dali Lama what he would do if science proved Buddhist teaching to be in error and he would say “change the teaching”.  Ask the Pope what he would do if science proved Catholic teaching to be in error and he would say, looking down his nose on the questionnaire,   “Sonny (or young Lady) we are the truth, science is wrong.” Speaking of truth, truth be known, the Church is so culturally invested in what it says and does that it cannot change and preservation of its priestly structure has taken priority over propagation of the truth and mediating salvation.  The new Pope has a lot of work to do.","date":"February 14, 2013 at 11:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/13/ash-wednesday-2013/","cat":"event","title":"Ash Wednesday 2013"},{"author":"tom_devins","post":"We could argue forever over the Church’s response science.

In September, 1998 the Buddhist Monk Khenpo A-Chos acquired Rainbow Body.  At death (if in fact he ever stopped breathing) over a period of seven days his body proportionately shrunk to the point that it finally disappeared.  The shrinkage was accompanied by the display of multi-colored radiation, hence the name Rainbow Body. It is also referred to as the Light Body and the adepts, of which there are thousands, also have the ability to re-materialize in the confines of space and time.  The phenomena occurs also occurs in the Hindu tradition and reminds us too of the strange deaths of Enoch, Elijah, Moses, Mary and Jesus.Father Francis Tiso (who has impeccable scholarly credentials) visited Khenpo A-Chos’ hermitage at which the disappearance took place and confirmed its authenticity. Google his name and read for yourself.  All the adepts from contemporary to antiquity had one thing in common; lifestyle of love, compassion and asceticism taken to the extreme.  These are virtues that we can also assign to the Old and New Testament figures who experienced Rainbow Body like deaths and are available to every living creature that chooses the path.   These qualities, taken together, result in the absolute destruction of ego.  Said another way, they indicate the cessation of observation of self.  From quantum physics (i.e. the Thomas Young Double Slit Experiment) we know that in the atomic realm, when human consciousness ceases to observe something,  that something ceases to exist. It returns to the realm of invisible wave, formless and everywhere at the same time, releasing the energy that it held when it existed in form and substance. The most plausible explanation for the image on the Shroud is that Jesus achieved Rainbow Body and the burst of radiation that followed produced a scorching effect on the burial cloth.  This conclusion is a bitter pill to swallow as it sends shock waves through fundamental Christian thought, from the alpha to the omega, the story of creation to that of resurrection of the body.  For sure, whether one imputes Rainbow Body to Jesus or not, the words in Genesis “to dust you shall return” need to be appended with the words, “but only if you so choose.”  And once you do, it is all downhill from there for the Christian theologian.","date":"February 18, 2013 at 10:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/18/one-handed-clapping-for-colin-berrys-criticism-of-the-colorado-paper/","cat":"image_theory","title":"One Handed Clapping for Colin Berry’s Criticism of the Colorado Paper"},{"author":"tom_devins","post":"I have communicated to Father Tiso by e-mail and hope to solicit his help in bringing the Rainbow Body phenomenon to light in the form of a video and/or book.

Called the Rainbow Body, it has occurred thousands of times in the past in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the most recent being in September, 1998 by the Buddhist monk Khenpo A-Chos. Other examples of Rainbow Body in the Christian tradition are Enoch, Elijah and possibly Moses.  The non-cannonical reports of Mary’s death, called the Assumption, indicate that she too acquired Rainbow Body.In late August of 1998,  A-Chos told his disciples he was going to leave this world.  Without signs of any illness he passed peacefully and comfortably while chanting a mantra.   Following Buddhist tradition his body was covered in a yellow cloth whereupon it was noticed that his now unwrinkled skin had turned a soft,  pinkish color.  As days passed his body continually shrank to childlike proportions until finally, on the seventh day, it completely disappeared.  During this seven day period outsiders noted a display of rainbow colored radiation coming from the burial hut.The truth is, something very significant and natural happens to the human body when it is exposed to a lifestyle of selflessness and love and compassion to others, all taken to the extreme and demonstrated in an unwavering commitment to a virtuous cause.  Such a lifestyle is the common denominator among the Rainbow Body adepts. A human body that vanishes into mid-air seems miraculous.  However, when viewed from a quantum perspective it all makes sense.  Quantum particles of which we (and everything else in the universe) are made cannot exist unless they are observed through human consciousness.  Now, one can have an opinion about anything except one cannot have an opinion about fact.  And, that atomic particles do not have an independent existence is a proven fact.  So, if an atomic particle can be brought into existence by observing it then it necessarily follows that it can be made to disappear by not observing it.  And that is exactly what  the Rainbow Body adepts do; they stop observing (and catering) to self through extreme asceticism and compassion for others.  Atomic particles are nothing more than vibrating energy.  So, when they cease to exist the vibrating energy is released into the surrounding area.  Jesus’ death was the most spectacular Rainbow Body of them all for his body dissolved in less than thirty-six hours while most dissolutions take place in seven days.  Thus, the energy that was released as HIs body dissolved was released in a much shorter period of time producing a high intensity radiation.  Italian researches at the National Agency for New Technologies have confirmed that linen cloth is sensitive to high intensity radiation. The short nature of His release compared to other adepts confirms Him to be the greatest manifestation of the divine the world has ever seen.And the thing about it is, the Rainbow Body adepts have no special skills or traits.  We all come from the factory with the same factory installed equipment.  The adepts knew how to bring forth the spiritual component better than most.  The question each person has to answer is, “how spiritual do I want to be”?  “How much material lifestyle do I want to sacrifice in order to bring forth my innate spiritual nature”?Even though the Catholic Church has studied the strange death of Khenpo A-Chos you don’t hear much about it.  For its implications are far reaching.  It questions the claim of divinity that early Church fathers made on Jesus.  Without question the greatest human to ever live, the operative word is “human”.  Human yes, divine no.  And when that claim is removed the virginity of Mary comes under the microscope, then the notion of original sin and so forth.  And the walls come tumbling down.  As the Catholic Priest who conducted an on-site investigation of Khenpo A-Chos death said, “we may have done a number on the flock.”  For sure, the words in Genesis, “…and to dust thou shalt return” need to be appended with the words “but only if you so choose.”","date":"December 13, 2012 at 11:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/13/livescience-goofs-again/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"LiveScience Goofs Again"},{"author":"tom_devins","post":"The quinnipiac poll, like all other polls, failed to ask THE question.

The Old Testament prophet Elijah left this world in a whirlwind accompanied by a flaming chariot.

It makes me wonder who is the real “goof ball” in the dialogue.   I don’t know, nor does anyone know with certainty,  where Jesus is buried… if He is buried at all. The connection between East and Christianity is a lot stronger than most people realize.  In the East’s ancient structures we find an abundance of Greco-Roman architecture.   There are lot of people in the East who believe Jesus’ tomb is in Kashmir and have located and revere it.   Murree beer in Pakistan is  named after Mary. According to the Pakistanis her grave is located in their country.  The names Abraham and Sara are curiously similar to the names of the Hindu God Brahma and his wife Sarasvati.  Hebrews eat beef but do not worship cows.  Hindu’s worship cows but do not eat beef.  After all, the Messiah’s job description included the duties of gathering in the lost tribes and a trip to the East would be of necessity. The 4,000 mile Silk Road from China to Alexandria was an active avenue that blossomed with trade and cultural exchange.   That is what traders do when the merchant deal is completed; they celebrate over a beer or two and exchange ideas.  You know, Abraham did dispatch some of his sons to the East.  St. John Chrysostom in his  Homily 26 from The Homily of Hebrews tells us the bones of Moses were laid in a strange [East] land. The seraph used by Moses for healing (Numbers 221:8) is taken straight from the ancient Buddhist-Hindu practice of Kundalini Yoga.What is “goof-ball” is to believe that an unbelievably  talented thirteen year old kid could stand toe to toe with Temple scholars debating scripture and then spend the next seventeen years of His life in the boon-docks of Nazareth,  “growing  in strength and wisdom” while happily working away in his father’s carpenter shop; a whistle while you whittle kind of upbringing.  If Jesus didn’t die in the East could he have spent time there?  Occult skills, like food multiplication, healing and so forth are acquired and emerging skills available to saintly people and in the ancient East there were many schools for that purpose.  The great Buddhist Saint Milarepa attended one and acquired magical skills which he used to extract revenge against his family’s enemies. Moses had them and used them effectively against the Pharaoh.  What is equally “goof-ball” is to not ask the question, if Jesus acquired the resurrected body He is said to have acquired,  then why did the stone need to be rolled away from the tomb?  Doors, walls and grave stones don’t mean anything to spirits.   If the full Sanhedrin had voted on Jesus’ fate the vote would have been 69 to 2 in favor of executing him.  The abstainers…..Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea.  Did Joseph of Arimathea, wealthy and influential as he was,  work a deal with Pilate?  After all, Pilate’s wife advised against the guilty verdict because of a dream she had.  Pilate did what He did, at least in part,  in order to avoid a riot in a population that was swollen because of the Passover Feast.   How come Jesus died so quickly on the cross?  Death from crucifixion could take days.   Why is it the two thieves were alive at the end of the day but not Jesus?  Can blood gush from the wounds of a dead man?  Why wasn’t His body dumped into a heap along with the bodies of the two thieves (and their broken legs) to be consumed by scavenging creatures as was the practice?  Why weren’t His disciples and relatives rounded up, their wealth confiscated and then sold into slavery as was Roman practice?  When one man and a small army revolted in Sepphoris in 6AD, the then capital of Galilee with a population of 30,000,  the Romans crucified 2,000 men, sold the residents into slavery and burned the city to the ground.  The Romans were brutal.   Perhaps a deal was struck between Joseph and Pilate.   Just maybe, just maybe,  Jesus wasn’t dead when taken from the cross.  Maybe after all he didn’t refuse the soothing “medication” that was offered to Him at the outset. Maybe the image on the Shroud was created in the same fashion as the one He deposited on the veil of Veronica while He was alive.  Maybe the gospel writers, in their enthusiasm for promoting their brand of Christianity, got carried away with their work. Who knows?  Who will ever know?  The facts and reasonable (but unanswered) questions at least suggest other possibilities for explaining Jesus’ death and resurrection.  Where there is smoke there is usually fire.  Lets be more accepting of the opinion of others and stop from calling “goof ball” those who have legitimate concerns and the courage to raise them.","date":"February 14, 2013 at 3:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/14/the-evidence-strongly-suggests-nothing-of-the-kind/","cat":"books","title":"The Evidence Strongly Suggests Nothing of the Kind"},{"author":"tom_devins","post":"You know, I just don’t know.  I have ordered Silvia’s book because I am interested in the subject.  Last September I had the privilege of sitting next to a thirteen year old boy named Norpa Rinpoche at the Buddhist Drikung Monastery about 50 miles from Lhasa. He is said to be the reincarnate of the monastery’s abbott who passed away 30 years ago.  Being the ignorant, uninformed Westerner that I am I asked his superior, “how do you know?”  Reincarnation is such an accepted belief among Easterners that the question is just not asked.  It is not a belief; it is a way of life.At age 3 Norpa Rinpoche  identified  the home in which the deceased abbott was born.  At age 7 he picked out the abbott’s personal effects from an assortment of the personal effects of others, all mixed together randomly.  I was told that a review of the deceased’s writings also pointed to Norpa Rinpoche as his reincarnate.  The Tibetan Buddhists are closely monitored by the Chinese who, among other controls over Tibetan religious expression, require that all reincarnates be approved as such by the government.  After documenting the case the Chinese approved Norpa Rinpoche as a reincarnate.For me personally, while I am not quiet sure if reincarnation is real of not, I can’t afford to be wrong.  If I do return I want to bring as much of what I have learned in this life back with me and am living accordingly, making sure that I have sufficient mind control to deal with the barrage of thoughts that will hit me when that last breath is taken.  My Christian belief that you get one and only one shot at life gave rise to a “bucket list” and the need to cram as much worldly experience as I can into my one and only lifetime.  Needless to say, the first think to hit the trash can in my preparation for death(I am 72 years young) was my bucket list, replaced by meditation exercises. I am afraid the Western travel and entertainment industry would be devastated if everyone adopted reincarnation.","date":"February 16, 2013 at 10:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/16/tinfoil-hats-all-around-quickly/","cat":"books","title":"Tinfoil Hats All Around, Quickly"}]}
