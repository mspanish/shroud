This first allows us to recreate the exact manner of how the body was laying at the time the image was formed.  The Vatican exhibit contains such a “statue” in repose and the knees and head are tilted up.  Forensics tell us that any such body is in rigor mortis.  We also know that rigor mortis relaxes after a max of 48 hours.  Thus, the 3D characteristic of the Shroud image establishes that the image was formed in the first 48 hours after death.  In other words, we are given a timeline for image formation by the 3D characteristic.  Also interesting to note that if the person forming the image died at about 3 PM on Friday it was about 40 hours until dawn on Sunday – well within the 48 hour limit.  Could this be the purpose of the 3D??  Very interesting!!","date":"May 27, 2013 at 1:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/26/the-shroud-of-turin-exhibit-museum-in-alamogordo/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin Exhibit & Museum in Alamogordo"}],"researchers":[{"author":"larry","post":"I think the Shroud is authentic, but I want more testing. I admit that I feel that it may be somewhat irreverent to keep testing what could be the Precious Blood of Jesus, but there are already enough blood samples floating around out there. Just take some small pieces from different parts of the cloth and carbon date them. If they come back 14th century, then it just confirms that the Shroud is not the actual burial cloth of Christ, but some kind of medieval oddity(a scorch, as theorized by colinsberry? Some kind of strange forgery? A miraculous image such as the tilma of Our Lady of Guadalupe?). If it dates to the 1st century, then we’re off to the races. And(as I suspect will happen) each piece has some anomalous date(2nd century, 6th century, etc), then each side can try to strengthen it’s argument for or against authenticity. I’m not as enamored of Pope Francis as some of my fellow Catholics, but I do believe God uses both the strengths and weaknesses of his servants, and maybe Francis will be the Pope who will say “what the hell!” and allow some more tests.","date":"March 2, 2014 at 11:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/02/jones-the-turin-shroud-is-authentic-get-over-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Jones:  The Turin Shroud is authentic.
