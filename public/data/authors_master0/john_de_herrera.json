The newly found cloth is made up of a simpler two-way weave.\" The Jesus burial shroud was supplied by Joseph of Arimathea, who donated his own prepared tomb for the burial of Jesus. Joseph and Nicodemus brought abundant spices and wrapped Christ's body in a fine linen cloth. Joseph was a wealthy man, traveled to distant lands, obviously the shroud was the finest he could find â€“ not a local weave. He had prepared the tomb and obviously the \"fine linen' cloth for his own use. The fact that the recent found cloth was a 'simpler two-way weave' doesn't prove that the Turin Shroud could not be authentic???? In addition, perhaps the fact that the cloth was so fine/expensive, is the reason it was saved, not discarded after the resurrection???jdh","date":"May 25, 2012 at 11:25 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2009/12/burial-shroud-proves-turin-shroud-not.html","title":"Burial shroud proves Turin Shroud not from 1st century C.E.
