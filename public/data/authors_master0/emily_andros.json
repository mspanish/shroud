{"art":[{"author":"emily_andros","post":"YES my grandmother was 100% GREEK and she had BLUE EYES and blond (dark blond) hair so SHE was of middle eastern descent and quite frankly she and her son (my dad) were LIGHTER skinned and had lighter eyes and hair than my mother who is Swedish/English (who has black hair and black eyes). SO yes Mr. Clarke don’t let the eyes throw you off.  Don’t forget also, if you’re going to believe in an all powerful creator of the universe, aka GOD, aka Jehova, then you really shouldn’t limit Him in your mind.  He can do anything.  Check out a movie called “Faith like Potatoes”…..that is a great movie about God being able to do anything and when He does “anything” He does it however he wants and not necesisarily by human standards or according to the laws of physics (try studying quantum physics if you think everything has to go by those standards, i.e., the “laws of physics”).  God bless you in your journey and also check out a show on the Bio channel called “I survived; beyond and back” which is all about Near Death Experiences.
