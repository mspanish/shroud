{"misc":[{"author":"luiza","post":"I am a devout christian. In 1995 I came across the Shroud of Turin with a friend.  I took the picture (it was just a photocoy of the shroud) to a Photo studio and asked him to photograph the shroud.  When developed I got a real photo of Jesus face clear and eyes open looking at me with eyes of love and sadness.  I was shocked by the picture.  I know exactly what Jesus looked like when he was alive because I have his photograph.  I treasure this picture and I look at it lovingly because this is a miracle for me.  I would like those people who doubt and also those who try to prove the authenticity of the holy shroud that it is real and not a fake.  I know this with all my heart because of the miracle.  I would like to get in touch with them but I don’t know how.  Yours in Christ – Luiza","date":"October 6, 2010 at 11:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/11/23/late-breaking-website-news/","cat":"2010","title":"Late Breaking Website News!"}]}
