{"researchers":[{"author":"bob_mullins","post":"Stephen... youclaim that the shroud is genuine,  yet this is contrary to scripture which surely must be the final authoratative evidence.  The shoroud is a complete body image, that is, in direct contact with the body... but Scripture indicates this cannot possibly be the case as the body of Jesus was wrapped in TWO seperate pieces of cloth, one described as linen, which was wrapped around the torso & legs, the other a 'cloth' wrapped around the head. according to John 20:7 (NIV)  'as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus' head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.'Some versions decribe the body cloth as 'bandages' or strips... not one continuous peice of cloth as the shroud is. Having personally seen the shroud in Turin a few years ago i can agree that it is a fascinating artefact. but NOT the shroud of Jesus... They dont even know where the real tomb is.... and NOTHING pertinent to the crucifixion or the Burial has survived. Anyway it is totally irrelevant.... as the Anges said, 'He is not here...He is risen' and that initself is far more important and relevant  than any piece of cloth. how is the Shoud in any way relevant to the Gospel.?  Focus on Jesus. 'The Author & finisher of our Faith' Keep the main thing.... the main thing.Blessings!
