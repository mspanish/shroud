{"art":[{"author":"marilyn_dalton","post":"I was still screaming, heartbroken, crying. You know when you lose a child? I was in walmart looking for anything to read ( I am a veryreadaholic) when I saw Heaven Is For Real, I bought it. I read it nonstop till I finished it.  No 4year-old little boy could ever make this up. I have faith in God that she went to Heaven and this book gave me so much hope and the parts about his parents slyly showing him pictures and he said no until he saw Akiane Kramarik, paintng of Jesus. And said That’s Him!!! I read the book several times and loaned it to one of my daughters who loaned it to her half sister until I get it back I will buy another. I’m nowhere  near thrugh greiving and probably never will.  At least I am comforted in knowing I will see all my family and Jesus and I am so waiting for God to take .e to Heaven. Thank you so much for telling Colton’s Heavenly visit.
