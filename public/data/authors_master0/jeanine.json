{"resources":[{"author":"jeanine","post":"The Urantia Book is an amazing document. It says nothingabout the shroud except that it was thrown over a near-by cliff.(meaning it was not destroyed) … but the way they explain why thetomb was empty gives ample evidence that the shroud could be thephotographic image of Jesus. His soul resurrected but his body wasleft behind. The angels were given permission to disintegrate hisbody in an instant so they wouldn’t have to witness the natural,slow, decomposition of his body. That flash could have created theimage, in my opinion. Here’s the quote: “The mortal remains ofJesus underwent the same natural process of elementaldisintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth exceptthat, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution wasgreatly accelerated, hastened to that point where it becamewell-nigh instantaneous.” 189:2.8 If the Urantia Book is a fake,it’s a doozy! Every word is the highest and best use of the Englishlanguage, there is no one making money on it, and it asks us tolook for the good in all religions that bring man closer to God.Most people just keep a closed mind and won’t really readit.","date":"February 12, 2013 at 11:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/09/the-urantia-book-again/","cat":"books","title":"The Urantia Book Again"}]}
