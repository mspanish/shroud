{"blood":[{"author":"gary_strecker","post":"So let’s suppose, hypothetically, that Joe Nickell’s and Walter McCrone’s assessment of just the blood (and not the body imprints, which I am not willing to concede) were correct.  Let’s say that red ocher and diluted vermilion were used to paint blood.  How could we know if such painting was original to each ‘wound’ site, or traced over existing blood?  Let’s say that the original intent was to exhibit this 14′ sheet as Jesus’ shroud.  The imprints of the body were already a mystery to a medieval crowd, but could be seen from a distance.  But the blood, perhaps, needed to be, at least in the artist’s mind, enhanced.  Is there a way to determine whether blood was original to each site, but that may be concealed under enhancement?  And do we know that every wound site displays equally (quantitatively as well as qualitatively) the same properties as those which are obviously ‘enhanced’ because of the brightness of the red, which should have darkened over time?  I would appreciate the best answer, but all are welcome, if there is any interest.Sincerely,Gary Strecker","date":"July 19, 2013 at 5:07 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/ok-so-there-is-bilirubin-in-the-shroud-bloodstains-or-so-we-are-told-but-how-much-precisely/","cat":"alan_d_adler","title":"OK, so there is bilirubin in the Shroud bloodstains (or so we are told).
