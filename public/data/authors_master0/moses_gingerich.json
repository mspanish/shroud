{"art":[{"author":"moses_gingerich","post":"Let me tell you, in 1990 I was “out” for 9 minutes without oxygen during a surgery accident. I can certainly say that heaven is real, that what this boy saw is very accurate. I would not doubt it one minute. My experience still causes my tears to appear with no way of holding them back. I was simply told I have to return back but I replied that I don’t want to, but the way was blocked. I could hear the doctors talking with the anesthesiologist -every word. The Dr. was amazed later that I was not cognitively impaired. It was simple: there were about 2-300 kids praying for me as I was a youth group leader.   Every day I am looking to go back to heaven. I just can hardly wait. Why did God make me come back? Was it because He wanted some specific unfinished work for me to be involved with?  Please, if you have any chance to be ready for your death, check out what you wish to do about it, and what you think about Jesus Christ. You may not have a second chance.","date":"July 11, 2011 at 8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
