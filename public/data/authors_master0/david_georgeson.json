{"researchers":[{"author":"david_georgeson","post":"Dear BarryHaving seen on TV various attempts at  verifying the authenticity of the so called Turin shroud. I have always been slightly puzzled that the image is so precise. If I am correct , at that time the body was normally wrapped in a shroud,the linen or whatever not just laid on the body. To my mind this would produce very different markings, I have not seen or heard of attempts to coat a living person with something which could mark the cloth, whilst correctly wrapping the body as in ancient times, in order to see just what image results. For instance on the Turin shroud there is no evidence of impression of the top of the head or the side and there is little sign of folding or creasing, which one would assume would be so profuse as to distort any image Further to this, The body of Christ was allegedly washed and anointed with various substances such as myrrh. Since dead bodies do not continue to bleed and no doubt all trace of blood would have been washed away, how is it that marks on the cloth appear to show fresh bleeding from the corpse precisely corresponding to the wounds Christ was meant to have suffered?","date":"March 24, 2013 at 7:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/01/30/barrie-schwartz-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwartz on the Shroud ofÂ Turin"}]}
