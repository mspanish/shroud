{"art":[{"author":"seija","post":"The book has been translated in Finnish. I read it Yesterday. It was and is so wonderful. Thank you so much. My husband doesnt want to hear of these kind of stories at all. He said that they are not true. I am so sorry for him. Please pray for him. He is like the one Colton was asking did he know Jesus. Well I love the book, Holy Spirit came in to my life in 1994 so I know what Colton is talking about, everything is in Bible and Colton saw so much! God bless all the readers. Thank you for writing this book!","date":"January 13, 2012 at 3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
