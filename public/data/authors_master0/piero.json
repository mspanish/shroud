I asked Charles Parker—a latent-fingerprint examiner with more than thirty years of experience in the field, who has helped to establish guidelines for fingerprint examiners in the United States—to review the chapter. He said that most of the arrows don’t point to actual overlapping characteristics, just random details, and that, judging from the images presented, the partial fingerprint on “La Bella Principessa” is too poorly detailed for an identification to be made. “No other examiner I know would sign off on it,” he said. “I couldn’t even get it past the door.” Wertheim agreed with this assessment, and suggested that Biro’s approach was the equivalent of trying to identify a man based on seeing his ear poking out from behind a bush for a fraction of a second.>“The fingerprint community can get quite dogmatic,” Biro told me in another conversation. “They don’t like people who rock the boat, and I could be seen as a loose cannon to some, because I’m questioning a lot of things.”Source :http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/07/12/100712fa_fact_grann— —and from another source :>The attribution to Leonardo DaVinci, based on  the multispectral scanning of  the Research Laboratory Lumiere-Technology, was confirmed in 2009 by six Art historians, Nicholas Turner, Carlo Pedretti, Alessandro Vezzosi, Mina Gregori, CristinaGeddo and Martin Kemp.>The main opposition came from the experts in New York and from some observers who had missed this attribution when the work was in the hands of Christie’s and the Gallery Ganz, against the background of lawsuit at the Court of New York brought against Christie’s by Jeanne Marchig, the previous owner who had consigned the drawing to the auction house for sale.>Through the knowledge of the original colours of the restored work, Martin Kemp and Pascal Cotte had tentatively identified the portrait as that of Bianca, the illegitimate daughter of Duke Ludovico Sforza, who was legitimized in 1496 and married to Galeazzo Sanseverino, Commander of the armies of the Duke.

However, that claim does not convince those who have sustained for many years the belief that it is a portrait of Mona Lisa or Lisa Gherardini.>Based on research by Glori, Bianca Sforza was the wife of Galeazzo Sanseverino and the legitimate daughter of Ludovico il Moro and Bernadina de Corradis, who lived in Bobbio, in northern Italy.

It suffered more when some supposed filamentous bacteria pointed out by Garza-Valdez were reclassified as ultimate threads from the linen fibrils, and more still when it was realised that bacteria and fungi are heterotrophic and, since all their carbon would be derived from what they ate (the shroud), the radiocarbon date would not be affected by them anyway. However it is not impossible that some bacterial contamination of the shroud may have affected its chemical composition.I have know the untenable Dr.Garza-Valdes’s arguments about the Shroud radiocarbon dating (also) because in March 2004 I have bought “The Orphaned Manuscript” by Alan Adler (Dorothy Crispino editor, first edition : 2002) and then I know what you wrote about the question. The objections by Adler appeared in the last article of that book : “The nature of the Body Images of the Shroud of Turin” (paper first published in : Proceedings of the Shroud of Turin International Research Conference, Brian Walsh ed., Richmond VA, 1999).

In the liver, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronyl transferase converts bilirubin to a mixture of monoglucuronides and diglucuronides, referred to as conjugated bilirubin, which is then secreted into the bile by an ATP-dependent transporter. This process is highly efficient under normal conditions, so plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentrations remain low. >A large number of disease states lead to bilirubin accumulation in plasma. Diseases that increase the rate of bilirubin formation, such as hemolysis, or diseases that reduce the rate of bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome, produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Barberis disregarded the useful ATR-FTIR, remind the paperby P. Garside [a Research Fellow in Conservation Science, Textile Conservation Centre,Univ. of Southampton, UK.  B.T.W: He also quoted two FTIR papers by J. M. Cardamone(a researcher known to the “Shroudies”), read the Bibliography of the paper relatedto the Historic Artifacts published in 2001… Not the Perkin Elmer paper, 2011] abouta particular version of that technique.Instead he sketched a particular perspective about the “poker holes”.He indicated the following techniques :  UV-Vis, IR, Raman, TOF-SIMS …as useful methodologies to verify the hypothesis that the origin of thatfamous “L” is not due to combustion, disregarding the AFM and CFM(= Chemical Force Microscopy).And I say these words taking apart the fact that, after the restoring of the year 2002,the inherent area changed (= it became a big hole instead of a little one)if I am right in my remark…After having indicated the idea of these controls on the reminds of the past “L”(= what was the area near the “poker holes”), he suggested the use ofmass spectrometry on water marksin order to compare the results with other sites without waterstains.I presume he wanted to indicate the TOF-SIMS controls that (unfortunately)aren’t “non-destructive controls”…In any case : do you remember the strange question of gamma irradiated samples(that I indicated few days ago) and the interesting changes in water adsorption?Well… this case is near similar our problem (to solve without destructions) …See also: the possible exact interpretation about the inherent “chromatographies” on linen!The AFM techniques can also be useful in the case of the tests“on the Holland cloth and on the patches removed in 2002”.But Barberis indicated only (and vaguely) “spectroscopic tests”…So …What was the meaning of this particular “smoke on our eyes” of the year 2012?How is possible to show a very good project of SPM (Scanning Probe Microscopy)line system on linen without any previous true help from the Laboratories? …— — — — —We have seen the past photographies about the Arizona’s sample =Report on the STERA, Inc. – University of Arizona Radiocarbon Dating LaboratoryMacro Photography – 30 August 2012link:    http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/arizona.pdfandthe observations by Pam Moon and Donna Campbell (“The black thread”) link: http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Three_threads_files/Arizona%20for%20website.pdfBut all these things are insufficient to emit a verdict.So, in my opinion, we have to test this sample under SPM analyses.Is it possible to contact Dr. Timothy Jull in order to obtain that controlor few (very little) linen samples to submit to the SPM tests?If the photographies about the Arizona’s sample were non-destructive controls,then the same can happen with tests under AFM techniques…But the advanced analyses on the sample of Arizona may not be sufficient to establish the truth regarding the whole cloth of the Shroud!So we have to do the comparisons with the other linen samples already taken from the Holy Shroud of Turin.… And this is the final sentence of my “analytical sermon”.l","date":"March 11, 2015 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"author":"piero","post":"In my idea your previous interesting discussionswere a bit far from the field of careful Textile Analyses.

As a book ages, the chemical compounds used—the glue, the paper, the ink–begin to break down. And, as they do, they release volatile compounds—the source of the smell.>A common smell of old books, says the International League for Antiquarian Booksellers, is a hint of vanilla: “Lignin, which is present in all wood-based paper, is closely related to vanillin. >As it breaks down, the lignin grants old books that faint vanilla scent.” … etc. … etc. …Here other links:http://www.compoundchem.com/2014/06/01/newoldbooksmell/>…A study in 2009 looked into the smell of old books, finding that the complex scent was a mix of “hundreds of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into the air from the paper,” says the Telegraph. …http://thescienceoffiction.net/tag/the-wonder-of-books/>… In total, there are hundreds of VOCs that can contribute to the overall scent of the book in question. However, there are several chemicals that can be both named and attributed to certain fragrances. One you might recognize is vanillin — the same chemical found in artificial vanilla. As you can guess, this contributes to the “hint of vanilla” mentioned by Strlič. A less familiar name (unless you took organic chemistry, or enjoy looking up chemical compounds) is 2-ethyl hexanol. This chemical offers a gentle floral scent. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_14_dating_of_the_Shroud_of_Turin>…(Rogers) stated that: “The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300- and 3000-years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years”.[ = Raymond N. Rogers, 2004, Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin, TCA paper]>Rogers concluded from this that the Shroud is much older than the earlier purported estimates…https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/page/5/>… However, there is another pitfall lurking here if Rogers thought that vanillin was a volatile material, going by the aroma from old wood.  That could conceal a major source of error if his sleeping partner, Dr. S.T.Kosiewicz of the title, was not aware of it. … etc. … etc. …>… while the nose can readily detect vanillin at exceedingly low concentrations in air, it’s in fact a white solid with a quite high melting point (82 degrees C).  So when Kosiewicz measured remaining “vanillin” (read coniferaldehyde) at 70 degrees C, he would have been measuring some of the vanillin end product that had failed to vaporise, still being a solid with low surface area.  But when he raised the temperature to 100 degrees, the vanillin would then be liquid, with a larger surface area, larger vapour pressure, and been able to escape more easily causing less interference in the measurement of remaining “lignin”. You see, the exponential nature of the reaction rate means that any small errors at the higher temperatures is likely to translate into major errors in estimating the tiny rates of decay under normal environmental temperature.>There’s an “if” here, namely  that Kosiewicz was measuring lignin by disappearance, using the Wiesner test, rather than some more specific test. But we are not told how he did his chemistry. Thus the title (and chief complaint) of this posting.

Chemometric regression modeling as well as classification studies were conducted on spectral data obtained with chili peppers and fabrics samples. Multivariate regression models known as partial least squares (PLS-1) were developed from the spectral data of alcoholic extracts of Habanero peppers. The developed regression models were used to predict the total capsaicinoids concentration of a set of unknown samples. The ability of the regression models to correctly predict the total capsaicinoids concentration of unknown samples was evaluated in terms of the root mean square error or prediction (RMSEP). The prediction ability of the models produced was found to be robust and stable over time and in the face of instrumental modifications. A near-infrared spectral database was developed from over 800 textile samples. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the diffuse near-infrared reflectance spectra from these commercially available textiles. The PCA models were combined together into a soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) in order to classify the samples according to fiber type. The samples in the study had no pretreatments. The discriminating power of these models was tested by creating validation sets within a given fiber type as well as attempting to classify samples into a category that they do not belong to. The apparent sub-class groupings within the same fiber class were investigated as to whether or not they were caused by chemical processing residues, multipurpose finishes, or dyes— — —I hope in other kind of analyses (see, for example, the investigations using the Chemical Force Microscopy)  in order to clarify the question …So …What is your answer about the CFM way in comparison with the other ways ?","date":"January 23, 2014 at 9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/22/comment-promoted-are-the-quad-mosaics-meaningless/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted: Are the Quad Mosaics Meaningless?"},{"author":"piero","post":"I don’t agree about the enthusiasm around a new round of carbon dating.(B.T.W. : … from where we can take the linen sample ?

The deformation of such fibres induces a shift in the 1095 cm−1 Raman band, corresponding to the ring structure of the particular polymorph, which can be calibrated against strain. It is shown that this band shift can be used to monitor the deformation micromechanics of fibrous networks (cotton paper) and the composite micromechanics of single natural cellulose fibre unidirectional composites. The shear lag approach of Cox [Br. J. Appl. Phys. 3 (1952) 72] is investigated for the fibrous network and composite materials. For the network it is demonstrated that this theory does not apply since bonding across the end modifies the stress transfer by ‘shear-lag’. For the natural fibre composites it is thought that bonding occurs across the ends, also modifying this effect, but other possibilities are discussed in detail.— —As you have read this work is far from the explanations about the mechanicaltests by Giulio Fanti (who controlled the Modulus of Young  in direct andreverse cycle, loss factor and loss factor in reverse cycle, etc.), butyou can also think at possible other ways to investigatethe material (… and, if it is possible, in a nondestructive manner !).For instance …in the previous messages (on this blog) I indicate the AFMthree point-bending tests.Then you can read (and see) what is illustrated under :http://www.tappi.org/content/events/08nano/papers/08nan22.pdfThe title of the presentation is the following :Young’s Modulus of Cellulose Fibrils measured using Atomic Force MicroscopybySiqun Wang and Qingzheng Cheng,Univ. of Tennessee (2008)— —Do you know the bending deflections (and Structural Mechanics) ?What is the result from the measurement ofthe elastic modulus (following that method) ?— —What is your opinion ?Observe the fibril lay on wafer and the fibril on groove …Where is the best way to work ?Perhaps you can try (by yourself) using the extra-fine linen foundin one of the pharaoh tombs !Some sources say that fine and even transparent linen apparelswere worn by Egyptian queens and it was revealed that the fine yarnwas obtained by enzymatic treatment of saliva (… in the human mouth !).I hope in your interesting observations …","date":"March 29, 2013 at 12:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/27/giulio-fanti-the-image-of-a-man-who-lived-between-280-bc-and-220-ad/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Giulio Fanti: The Image of a Man Who Lived Between 280 BC and 220 AD"},{"author":"piero","post":"First of allYou must read in the book (by Fanti and Gaeta) the interesting Chapter 3 :“Le datazioni alternative”= “The  alternative dating”The three methods :– FTIR/ATR,– Raman,– mechanical datingare all well explained (for the public).Then, in my opinion, you can learn something of interest (for your studiesabout the Holy Shroud of Turin) if you buy that new book.There are also some words about the controls for aninteresting sample coming from Masada (radiocarbon dated) …that sample was contaminated with CaCO3 (and then it was washed) …Well.Under the optical controls numerous parameters of this sampleseemed to be similar those of the samples taken from the Holy Shroud.But the heat exposure for the samples of the Shroud … … ….

Published 23 December 2013.© 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd Abstract>Due to the complexity of the surface topography,accurate surface characterization requires three-dimensional (3D)surface measurements. Confocal laser scanning microscopy(CLSM) is a non-destructive and versatile technique for quantifying3D surfaces. The response of measurement quality to variations inCLSM hardware settings and specimen properties has been investigated.>Through these investigations, certain criteria have been developedto select the optimal CLSM settings to minimize image noise,maximize contrast and resolution for reliable and accurate3D surface measurements. The surface measurement resultswere then compared with those obtained from the stylus instrument,phase shifting interferometer (PSI) and the coherence scanning interferometer(CSI). With the optimal hardware settings, CLSMs proved to bean appropriate instrument for measuring moderately rough to roughsurfaces regardless of surface reflectivity or surface finish.>It exhibits versatility for measuring surfaces of complex geometry,which is needed in the engineering field.

Abundant information was gained over the years with these techniques, so that the evaporation of macroscopic drops of simple liquids from inert surfaces is nowadays well understood. The same techniques are, however, not applicable to microscopic drops. Furthermore they do not directly provide a measure of the interfacial stresses arising at the contact area between liquid and solid, which are known to play a key role in the evaporation kinetics of small drops.>Here I show how the use of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers as sensitive stress, mass, and temperature sensors can be employed to monitor the evaporation of microdrops of water. Starting drop diameters are always below 100 μm. The foremost interest lies in exploring the last stages of the evaporation processSee also :Atomic Force Microscope Cantilevers Used as Sensors for Monitoring Microdrop EvaporationElmar Bonaccurso, Dmytro S.

Similar techniques are, however, hardly applicable to microscopic drops. Moreover, they do not provide a measure of the interfacial stresses arising at the contact area between liquid and solid.>Here we demonstrate the use of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers as sensitive stress, mass, and temperature sensors for monitoring the evaporation of microdrops of water from solid surfaces.>Starting from considerations on drops in equilibrium, we will further discuss evaporating drops and details of the experimental technique. We will show how the evaporation of water microdrops on a hydrophobic surface differs from the evaporation on a hydrophilic surface, and how this difference becomes more pronounced towards the end of evaporation.>We further show that one-side metal-coated cantilevers, acting as bimetals, allow measuring the average temperature of an evaporating microdrop.>Finally, we will discuss two further applications of microdrops evaporating on cantilevers, namely testing the local cleanliness of cantilevers’ surfaces and calibrating cantilevers’ spring constants— — —Perhaps there is the possibility to do the controls about solutions ofSaponaria officinalis (and then, see also : the behavior of Saponariaon linen fibrils = concentration-evaporation phenomena, etc.) and/or starch(hot) solutions … or water …with dissolved radioactive salts (… !?!?!?).So … the possible next contamination from ukrainian nuclear reactors,during the turmoils, is not an unsolved problem …… because under :http://www.ivanhoe.com/science/story/2011/08/896a.htmlWe can read :>… The earthquake in Japan raised an even biggerissue– radioactivity.

In this work, surface-enhancedRaman spectroscopy (SERS) was applied tothe analysis of textile fibers dyed with madderfrom two different botanical species, Oldenlandiaumbellata L. and Rubia tinctorum L.>The resulting SERS spectra were interpretedin light of the actual composition of the madderdyes as determined by high-performance liquidchromatography. Interestingly, the SERS spectrawere found to exhibit very distinctive spectralfeatures depending on the different anthraquinonederivatives present in the dyes. In particular, theSERS spectrum of O. umbellata L. was found tomatch the spectrum of alizarin, while the SERSspectrum of R. tinctorum L. was surprisinglydominated by signals due to the less studiedanthraquinone compound pseudopurpurin.>With this study, we demonstrate that SERS spectramay offer valuable information regarding the majorcoloring constituents present in different madder species.>Moreover, our work shows that not only can SERSbe used successfully to differentiate among closelyrelated anthraquinone derivatives, but also thatthis technique is particularly suitable for the detectionof pseudopurpurin, leading to the identification ofthis compound in a number of works of art.

Also they saw that part of this spot was charred black (obviously by the 1532 fire).Now the problem to solve [after the restore operation (year 2002), etc., etc.] is connected with the pattern of drips found on the Shroud :Is it possible to know (using Raman controls, CFM, etc.) the truth about the origin for these stains ?Are we sure that these drip patterns went into the Shroud before the body and blood images ?Where are our conjectures about useful advanced controls ?Are these controls an useless waste of time or not ?————————————————————————-In their work the Jacksons indicated that:– Cheroset was a mixture of red wine, nuts and apples.– Cheroset in Passover liturgy symbolizes the nortar that the Israelite slaves used in the construction of bricks for the Pharaoh’s building projects,– Cheroset is a vital element in the Passover “Seder” Liturgy and cannot be deleted or even replacet with another food item[Abarbanel Haggadah, Mesorah Publishers, p. 121)————————————————————————-Link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charoset>Charoset, haroset, or charoses (Hebrew: חֲרֽוֹסֶת [ḥărōset]) is a sweet, dark-colored paste made of fruits and nuts eaten at the Passover Seder.See also under :http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/etm/etm068.htm>Cheroset is a kind of mixture or compound, made with dates, raisins, and other fruit, with vinegar, to commemorate the lime, &c., with which our ancestors were forced to labour in Egypt","date":"September 10, 2014 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/10/a-report-on-the-bari-conference/","cat":"conference","title":"A Report on the Bari Conference"},{"author":"piero","post":"Maria da Gloria Moreira wrote:>There was also a weird presentation by Professor Valery Shalatonin from bielorussian Minsk University describing the detection of an electric field around a real size replica of the Shroud and it’s biological effects-this was indeed very interesting and a brand new issue.Then, see also another strange work by V.

Theaim of this paper is to attempt to combine physical and metaphysical intensity states forconsciousness. It is shown that widening of parapsychology to the solution of quantumconsciousness can be important in the explanation of paranormal phenomena. I have appliedequations in quantum mechanics to quantum consciousness. These equations can have twosolutions, one of which describes waves, energy and matter propagating from the past to thefuture and the other describes waves, energy and matter propagating from the future to the past. Working on the mathematical properties of the advanced solutions, mathematician LuigiFantappiè discovered in 1941 that they coincide with the qualities of living systems what theyare concentration of energy, differentiation, structures and order, thus arriving at the conclusionthat life, more than being effected by causes placed in the past, is attracted by causes placed inthe future. Therefore, the parameters of the autonomic nervous system, which supports vitalprocesses, should show anticipated reactions to future stimuliSee also in Wikipedia:>…  … This more developed version of their ideas was also widely attacked, and notably by the physicist Max Tegmark, who calculated that quantum states in microtubules would survive for only 10−13 seconds, too brief to be of any significance for neural processes.[6] Hameroff and the physicists Scott Hagan and Jack Tuszynski replied to Tegmark arguing that microtubules could be shielded against the environment of the brain.

It supports and ensures research collaboration between them by launching and managing different types of project calls. Within the EMRP Call 2012 “Metrology for Industry”, the joint research project (JRP) entitled “Multidimensional Reflectometry for Industry” (xD-Reflect) was submitted by a consortium of 8 National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and 2 universities and was subsequently funded. The general objective of xD-Reflect is to meet the demands from industry to describe the overall macroscopic appearance of modern surfaces by developing and improving methods for optical measurements which correlate with the visual sensation being evoked. In particular, the project deals with the “Goniochromatism”, “Gloss” and “Fluorescence” properties of dedicated artifacts, which will be investigated in three main work packages (WP). Two additional transversal WP reinforce the structure: “Modelling and Data Analysis” with the objective to give an irreducible set of calibration schemes and handling methods and “Visual Perception”, which will produce perception scales for the different visual attributes. Multidimensional reflectometry involves the enhancement of spectral and spatial resolution of reference gonioreflectometers for BRDF measurements using modern detectors, conoscopic optical designs, CCD cameras, line scan cameras, and modern light sources in order to describe new effects like sparkle and graininess/coarseness.More information and updated news concerning the project can be found on the xD-Reflect website http://www.xdreflect.eu/ .— —Some explanation about the word “Goniochromatism”:= The phenomenon where the color of a material changes as the angle of illumination and/or viewing is changed.

When an interference pigment is coated on a white surface, he reflection color is seen in the highlight and the transmission color in the background. The variations in color with the angle of incidence and the angle of observations is referred to as goniochromatism.

Dokukin and Igor Sokolov Abstract>The modulus of elasticity of soft materials on the nanoscale is of interest when studying thin films, nanocomposites, and biomaterials. Two novel modes of atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been introduced recently: HarmoniX and PeakForce QNM. Both modes produce distribution maps of the elastic modulus over the sample surface. Here we investigate the question of how quantitative these maps are when studying soft materials. Three different polymers with a macroscopic Young’s modulus of 0.6–0.7 GPa (polyurethanes) and 2.7 GPa (polystyrene) are analyzed using these new modes. The moduli obtained are compared to the data measured with the other commonly used techniques, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), regular AFM, and nanoindenter. We show that the elastic modulus is overestimated in both the HarmoniX and PeakForce QNM modes when using regular sharp probes because of excessively overstressed material in the samples. We further demonstrate that both AFM modes can work in the linear stress–strain regime when using a relatively dull indentation probe (starting from ∼210 nm). The analysis of the elasticity models to be used shows that the JKR model should be used for the samples considered here instead of the DMT model, which is currently implemented in HarmoniX and PeakForce QNM modes. Using the JKR model and∼240 nm AFM probe in the PeakForce QNM mode, we demonstrate that a quantitative mapping of the elastic modulus of polymeric materials is possible. A spatial resolution of ∼50 nm and a minimum 2 to 3 nm indentation depth are achieved.Link:http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la302706bAs you already know, the measurements on the modulus of elasticity(= Young’s modulus) are useful for determining the probableage (= probable epoch) of the material…— — —If we have to go beyond the known informations on“Compatibility between Shroud of Oviedo and the Holy Shroud”,then we must use the right tools (= AFM techniques, IMO) and compareboth linen materials (using the adequate AFM apparels[= microscopes that permit other controls, for example:AFM-Raman analyses, etc. …]).Have you understood what is the situation ?Then …Now I hope in your interesting replies!— —Here antoher reference:Atomic Force Microscopy Techniques for Nanomechanical Characterization: A Polymeric Case StudybyMelania Reggente, Marco Rossi, Livia Angeloni, Emanuela Tamburri, Massimiliano Lucci, Ivan Davoli, Maria Letizia Terranova, Daniele PasseriAbstract>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a versatile tool to perform mechanical characterization of surface samples at the nanoscale. In this work, we review two of such methods, namely contact resonance AFM (CR-AFM) and torsional harmonics AFM (TH-AFM). First, such techniques are illustrated and their applicability on materials with elastic moduli in different ranges are discussed, together with their main advantages and limitations. Then, a case study is presented in which we report the mechanical characterization using both CR-AFM and TH-AFM of polyaniline and polyaniniline doped with nanodiamond particles tablets prepared by a pressing process. We determined the indentation modulus values of their surfaces, which were found in fairly good agreement, thus demonstrating the accuracy of the techniques.

Bruno Barberis(Director of the International Center of Sindonology)The title of his speech includes three of the same words(= past, present and future) used in the past Symposiumof Villa Gualino (Turin, March 2000).But, despite the years (14 years !), there is not yet the right levelof analyses (= AFM, CFM, SNOM and Raman).Only Giulio Fanti was able to do something with Ramanand ATR-FTIR. But this is not enough ! …I believed that advanced microscopies can solve several problems andpoints remained obscure (f.e. : identificaion of the exact compositionfor TLs [= thin layers] on linen fibrils involved in BIF = Body Image Formation).But I was not able to persuade / convince anyone to analyzethe treated linens (experiments).2 – We can see that interesting problems about Oviedo’s Clothare investigated by large patrol of spanish researchers(= “Shroud of Turin and Sudarium of Oviedo”).Twenty years ago I was happy to see the points of congruencebetween the Shroud and Sudarium, and now…What is the “New Coincidence between Shroud of Turin and Sudarium of Oviedo” ?What is your opinion ?3 – Pollen on the Shroud of Turin The trace left by anointing and embalmingby M. Boi (University of the Balearic Islands), that is an expert in Palynology,which is the science that studies pollen.That could be a great intervention, we have to pay attention…because this study can be an extremely interesting work.— —The pollen exine, which is the outer layer of the grain,is composed of sporopollenin…Using the AFM techniques we can control the pollen adhesion to linen(and oil of embalming, etc.), etc.,and AFM observations can reveal the level of pollen erosion.Under :http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/wallI have found an interesting explanation :>In addition to the purely mechanical function of the exinein protecting the reproductive cells from environmental injury,exine sculpturing plays an important role in attachmentto insect pollinators and adhesion to the stigmatic surfaces;while wind pollinated species including many grasses andtree species often lack elaborate structure and appear smooth. … …And what is the difference about exine and intine ?>Beneath the exine, which is defined by the presence of oneor two basal nexine layers, a second major wall layer surroundsthe pollen grain protoplasm termed the intine. While the exineis composed of sporopollenin, a complex and highly resistantbiopolymer containing fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, phenolicsand carotenoids, the intine is largely composed of pectin and cellulose. …— —Now the problem :How can change over the centuries the material of pollen?— —A previous Boi’s report (Valencia 2012) clearly highlights that the pollenis proof that the shroud, which is kept in Turin, was a winding-sheet and was used according to rituals common in the Middle East over a thousand years ago.B.T.W. : Under the address :http://extension.uned.es/actividad/7018I have found another work by Marzia Boi (Universitat de les Illes Balears),here the title : “Sábana Santa de Turín y Sudario de Oviedo: pruebas científicasdel crimen de Jesús de Nazaret”.So …If Max Frei made no attempt to distinguish between anemophilous andentomophilous pollen material, meanwhile, forensic science has progressed.In my previous intervention I remembered that is important to record the nature of pollen grains, the we were not able to deepen the question…If the pollen grains are powdery, dust like, this is an indication about wind pollination.Usually pollen grains are sticky in insect pollinated flowers.So we have to control what are the levels of viscoelasticity and adhesion …I have several doubts about the precision of that control,after the centuries and aging…In my opinion that work is not a nonsensical control andI am still curious about that unsolved question.4 – In my opinion Giulio Fanti author of the intervention :Optical features of flax fibers coming from the Turin Shroudwas able to do something using PLM (= Polarized Light Microscopy)and not with SPM …But I am still curious to follow what are the interesting observations.For now we can imagine something.For example:it is possible to show something about the ancient treatment= the beaten linen fibrils observed in optical field (PLM) …or :Was he able to measure the Viscoelastic Propertiesthrough “calibrated optical observations” ?Now remains a curiosity for what we still need to know…5 – At the end there are the studies about the strange EQLsand Earthquakes …= Sky Darkening during Strong Earthquakes as Hypothesis ofEarth’s Crust Emission in Holy Shroud Image Study.See, for example, what wrote Fidani :>A seven-month collection of testimonials about the 6 April 2009 earthquake in Aquila, Abruzzo region, Italy, was compiled into a catalogue of non-seismic phenomena. Luminous phenomena were often reported starting about nine months before the strong shock and continued until about five months after the shock. …Link:http://www.academia.edu/5586287/The_earthquake_lights_EQL_of_the_6_April_2009_Aquila_earthquake_in_Central_Italy— —Another interesting study (with Giovanna De Liso and Andrea Viotto):Multi-Parametric Monitoring System of Associated Seismic Phenomenologyand Unusual Animal Behaviour in Western Piedmont.Here an excerpt from the Abstract:> Earthquakes have been seldom associated with reported non-seismic phenomenaobserved weeks before and after shocks. Non-seismic phenomena are characterized byunusual sounds and light emissions as well as degassing of vast areas near the epicentrewith chemical alterations of shallow geosphere (aquifers, soils) and the troposphere.Many animals are sensitive to even the weakest changes in the environment, typicallyresponding with behavioural and physiological changes. … … …Link:http://www.researchgate.net/publication/263075541_Multi-Parametric_Monitoring_System_of_Associated_Seismic_Phenomenology_and_Unusual_Animal_Behaviour_in_Western_Piedmont— — —For now I’ll stop here…Perhaps I “drank” too much knowledge with you.But the thirst for knowledge is never satisfied!In fact I think it is not enough to write, insteadit is necessary to work in proper laboratories…","date":"August 12, 2014 at 6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/11/final-program-for-bari-conference/","cat":"event","title":"Final Program for Bari Conference"},{"author":"piero","post":"PALINOLOGY…The term palynology was introduced by Hyde and Williams in 1944(see also under : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palynology).Different forms of the exine surface.Link:http://www.botany.unibe.ch/paleo/pollen_e/surface.htm>The sculpturing of the pollen grain is the ornamentation ofthe exine surface which can be psilate, foveolate, areolate (frustillate),gemmate, clavate, verrucate, baculate, echinate, rugulate, striate or reticulate.— —Pollen grains consist of three substances…See also under :http://www.botany.unibe.ch/paleo/pollen_e/morphology.htm>The outer cell wall, the exine, consists mainly of sporopollenin,an N-free polymeric substance belonging to the terpenes.>Sporopollenin is chemically unsaturated and is corroded byOxygen (oxidation), but is otherwise resistant even to stronglyalkaline substances and organic acids.

Alejandro Pezet was saying Holy Mass at a Catholic church in the commercial center of Buenos Aires. As he was finishing distributing Holy Communion, a woman came up to tell him that she had found a discarded host on a candleholder at the back of the church. On going to the spot indicated, Fr. Alejandro saw the defiled Host. Since he was unable to consume it, he placed it in a container of water and put it away in the tabernacle of the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament.On Monday, August 26, upon opening the tabernacle, he saw to his amazement that the Host had turned into a bloody substance. He informed Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, who gave instructions that the Host be professionally photographed. The photos were taken on September 6. They clearly show that the Host, which had become a fragment of bloodied flesh, had grown significantly in size. For several years the Host remained in the tabernacle, the whole affair being kept a strict secret. Since the Host suffered no visible decomposition, Cardinal Bergoglio decided to have it scientifically analyzed.>On October 5, 1999, in the presence of the Cardinal’s representatives, Dr. Castanon took a sample of the bloody fragment and sent it to New York for analysis. Since he did not wish to prejudice the study, he purposely did not inform the team of scientists of its provenance. One of these scientists was Dr. Frederic Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], the well-known cardiologist and forensic pathologist. He determined that the analyzed substance was real flesh and blood containing human DNA. … …>… ..Two Australians, journalist Mike Willesee and lawyer Ron Tesoriero, witnessed these tests. Knowing where sample had come from, they were dumbfounded by Dr. Zugiba’s testimony. Mike Willesee asked the scientist how long the white blood cells would have remained alive if they had come from a piece of human tissue, which had been kept in water. They would have ceased to exist in a matter of minutes, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied. The journalist then told the doctor that the source of the sample had first been kept in ordinary water for a month and then for another three years in a container of distilled water; only then had the sample been taken for analysis. Dr. Zugiba’s was at a loss to account for this fact. There was no way of explaining it scientifically, he stated. Only then did Mike Willesee inform Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!] that the analyzed sample came from a consecrated Host (white, unleavened bread) that had mysteriously turned into bloody human flesh. Amazed by this information, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied, “How and why a consecrated Host would change its character and become living human flesh and blood will remain an inexplicable mystery to science—a mystery totally beyond her competence.”Dr. F.

Rogers and Anna Arnoldi>… Postmortem body temperatures can reach 41ºC (Irvine, 2001), and steep temperature gradients would exist across the cloth as a result of the low thermal diffusivity of linen and theangular dependence of radiant heat flow from a nonmetallic surface (Gubareff et al, 1960).Then they concluded that temperature gradients will have a large effecton Maillard reaction rates and these combination of factors could producea distribution of reaction products with the appearance of the image.I have pointed out (but a bit in a bad way. Sorry…) the question of urea.In short, I wanted to underline that the cadaveric amines(= putrescine and cadaverine, etc.) are the main candidates(if I am right in my readings) for the famous Maillard reactionindicated by Rogers and Arnoldi (and then we have to see what isthe possible role for urea).Link:in https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers7.pdf.>Ever since the French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard studied the metabolism of urea and kidney illnesses and published his thesis on the actions of glycerin and sugar on amino acids in 1913, the Maillard reaction has been a hot research topic. A review on browning reactions in dehydrated foods, which appeared in the first volume of Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, remains the most-cited paper in that journal’s history.

Aufl. 1892). Athenais war die geistvolle Tochter des heidnischen Philosophen Leontius, trat zum Christentum über, wurde als Gemahlin Theodosius’ II. Kaiserin Eudokia (421 – 441 oder 444) und endete, seit 450 Witwe, ihr Leben ca. 460 zu Jerusalem im Exil. Ihre Geschichte interessierte G. um so mehr, als sie ihm “eine zweifache Metamorphose Griechenlands versinnbildlichte: den Übergang vom Heidentum in das Christentum und vom Hellenentum in das Byzantinertum”. So konnte er mit der Erzählung der Geschicke der Athenais wieder eine höchst anschauliche, lehrreiche Schilderung jenes Umwandlungsprozesses verbinden, der ihn, wie ähnliche andere Übergangsperioden, ausnehmend fesselte.— —1882 Gregorovius published the monograph “Athenaïs, Story of a Byzantine Empress”, which is added to the translation of a song of her poem “Cyprian and Justina,” as it were “the first poetic treatment of the theme of the Faust legend” (3rd edition, 1892). Athenaïs was the spirited daughter of the pagan philosopher Leontius, converted to Christianity, was as the wife of Theodosius II, Empress Eudocia (421-441 or 444) and ended, since 450 widow, lives about 460 to Jerusalem in exile.— —Here another (vague) reference :Jannic Durand et Bernard Flusin, éd., Byzance et les reliques du Christ.Paris, Association des Amis du centre d’Histoire et Civilisation de Byzance, 2004, 258 p.

Di Lazzaro about the excimer lasers and the VUV.2) Was the Image obtained applying the Ark of the Covenant (a great mystery of the Bible as energy source) to the Corpse ?

ABSTRACTPositron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) is a novel method that provides molecular-level information about complex macromolecular structure in a manner different from, but complementary to, conventional physical and chemical methodology. This paper presents a perspective of PAS in polymeric systems covering 12 aspects: historical, spacial, spherical quantum model, anisotropic structure, voids, positronium chemistry, time, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and data analysis, variable monoenergetic slow positron beam techniques and depth profiling, elemental analysis, multidimensional instrumentation advances in PAS, and free volume and free-volume theories.Perspective of Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy in Polymers.

See also what described the Norm “UNI 8282″…). This parameter is undoubtedly interesting and you have to choose safe areas, free from the effects of mechanical damage (folds, plies, see also the issue of historical folds, already indicated by Dr. John Jackson. After treatment of 2002, however, it would not seem wise to get into those issues) or biological degradation (mold, fungus, etc.) or thermal degradation (Chambery fire of 1532).In my opinion it should also compare the values ​​of the degree of polymerization (cellulose) obtained by the AFM analyses with the other analyses AFM : “AFM three-point bending test”.Here is a possible reference:http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v84/i9/p1603_s1?isAuthorized=noAppl.

In this study, the potential relationships between the microstructure and the surface properties of different cotton fibers are analyzed.

By measuring the retention time of probes into a column containing the fibers, thermodynamic surface characteristics of these fibers, in particular the dispersive component of their surface energy, and their surface morphological aspects, are determined.

It was found that while the track and damage openings could be similar in size and shape, the depths for the damages were consistently smaller. Therefore, the depth of the pits will serve as a clear criterion to differentiate between tracks and other damages.

(B.T.W.: Do you know these granules ?)In any case my name is not connected with Fanti, Botella, Di Lazzaro,Heimburger and Svensson. Yes, the study “Microscopic and Macroscopic Characteristics of the Shroud of Turin Image Superficiality” was an interesting attempt,but that work was not careful (speaking from the point of view of Textile Chemistry and Applied Microscopy …). So, I remained aloof from that “inconsistent work” (Sorry…Here no offence or personal affront !) claiming something without the required proofs (because they don’t used the advanced Microscopies = AFM, CFM …).Have you read the book : “Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood”(2001) by Oliver Sacks ?It is an autobiographical account of his early life in a family where curiosity and inquisitiveness were encouraged.Reading a page of  this book we found the interesting comment aboutthe discovery of the vision for the true atoms withthe (Tungsten) tip of an Atomic Force Microscopy.Well…Why I have cited Oliver Sacks ?In 1998 I wrote about AFM (as a method to control the truth about the samples from the Shroud, see also : the 14C tests of 1988)without the support of true controls, a forewarning with a vague image from the University of Pisa.Instead Ray Rogers indicated another kind of approach : ESCA (= Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis), in the paper “An Alternate Hypothesis for the Image Color”.But he pretty convincingly established the fact of a thin layer of starch impurities on the surface of the fibers.So… We have to show that presence (of starch) using the modern tools andthat (perhaps) was not well appreciated by Fanti & other researchers.Theses guys (with all due respect to their academic qualifications)pointed the finger mainly toward the primary cell wall…Perhaps they are not familiar with the different properties ofthe different fractions of starch.So… What is your opinion ?When tested with iodine, normal soluble starch turns blue.Starch that is soluble only in hot water turns red.Do you agree on that information ?For example:I have read that erythrodextrin can be distinguished fromother carbohydrates by its red color reaction with iodine.And I have found another information:>Starch is converted to erythro-dextrin and dextrose byboiling with dilute mineral acids.If the boiling is prolonged the erythro-dextrin is converted to dextrose…Source:http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Exercises_in_Practical_Physiological_Chemistry_1000245717/45[Exercises in Practical Physiological Chemistry by Sydney William Cole, 1927]There are three kinds of dextrins :amylo-, erythro- and achro-;the amylo- and erythro-dextrins giving a red or brownish colourwith iodine solution, the achro-dextrin being unaffected by this reagent.From Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrin )we know that :>Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight  carbohydratesproduced by the hydrolysis of starch …In any case Rogers indicated us that higher-molecular-weight,hot-water-soluble starch is the last to wash out of a clothand the reaction with iodine produces a red color…Where are the colored photomicrograph of red fibers ?Have you seen the interesting images ?Have you found the useful chemical proofs?Are you able to send us inherent pictures ?In your study there are no images…Why ?I believe that Colin Berry is able to show us the red fibers…Am I wrong in my idea ?How to estimate the exact composition of thin layers on linen fibrils ?Is it possible to control the famous “ghosts” using non-destructive analyses ?— —Now I want to speak about my doubts about the quantity(and distribution) of cadaveric gases involved intothe scenario proposed by Arnoldi and Rogers …IMO Rogers was an able thermochemist but (although heclaimed the Maillard reaction as solution forthe problem) he was not able to solve the Enigmawith a incontrovertible and credible experiment(B.T.W. : DETA is not a natural amine !).— —Yesterday I have read the acronym DC-STE(DC= Direct Contact, STE = Sorptive Tape Extraction ).If you try with Google using that acronym probably you will find few or nothing…But there is a method based on direct contact sorptive tape extraction followed by on-line thermal desorption gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (DC-STE–GC–MS) to detect and quantify a group of suspected volatile allergens …So, the exact acronym is not DC-STE, but DC-STE–GC–MS…Where are the useful works?I have read something, but they were far from the resolution of the Shroud …— —

An application for which it has received growing interest is in the analysis of paint cross-sections. However, FTIR microscope configurations, objectives’ geometries and low spatial resolutions, and issues of sample preparation have often hampered the characterization of individual layers or features in cross-sections. With the use of case studies, it is demonstrated here that an ATR-FTIR microscope featuring a crystal of optimized geometry and a viewing capability feature allows characterization of individual layers, or areas within layers, of 10 μm thickness or less in single measurements. Of particular value is a remote aperturing feature which allows the analysis of selected areas within the contact footprint of the ATR crystal. Since the technique is non-destructive, the same area can be analyzed by complementary microscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was also used in some cases to corroborate the spectroscopic data. The analyses presented provided data which were important in informing art historical interpretation and conservation of the artworks examinedLink:http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00216-008-2064-2#2- ATR-FTIR imaging for the analysis of organic materials in paint cross sections: case studies on paint samples from the National Gallery, LondonMarika Spring, Camilla Ricci, David A.

The first case furnished the following value = 1”, 98 + 0”,30 and the second indicated 1”,61+0”,30.But in 1923 William Wallace Campbell and Robert Julius Trurmper , published an article where the prevision of General Relativity (by Einstein) about stellar light deflection due to the mass of Sun were compared with a group of measurements taken during a total eclipse of Sun that happened in September 21, 1922.The theretical value foreseen by General Relativity was 1″,745, instead the experimental mean value found was equal to 1″,72 +/- 0″,11. Then the comparison turned to be a strong confirmation for the theorical value.Here few other lines (History of Science): early calculations done by EInstein in 1911 indicated a deflection value of 0″,87 (in 1911, Einstein wrote: “A ray of light going past the Sun would accordingly undergo deflexion to an amount of 4×10-6 = 0.83 seconds of arc.”), then a value near identical of that indicated in 1801 by Johann Georg von Soldner (1776-1833), a scientist who remained in the field of the Newton’s theory and also hypothesized that light was an heavy body subject to the diffusion from the solar mass.But in 1915 the newtonian idea was replaced by arguments based on space’s curvature and the estimation flowed into a value twice (= 1″,74) with respect the previous data .Unfortunately in 1914 and in 1916 there was the war period and in 1918 an attempt achieved by american researchers did not produced a sufficient amount of data … That is: at the end we must remember the famous phrase… “Carthago delenda est” !…Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativityPlease, read the similar words under the paragraph: “Deflection of light by the Sun”:>… The first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere. The observations were performed in May 1919 by Arthur Eddington and his collaborators during a total solar eclipse,[12] so that the stars near the Sun could be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil and in São Tomé and Príncipe on the west coast of Africa.[13] The result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers. It made Einstein and his theory of general relativity world-famous. When asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by Eddington and Dyson in 1919, Einstein famously made the quip: “Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway.” . …… and then now my hands are almost burning for impatience!But I have found another link:http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/eclipse/index.htmlWhere we can read the following words:>In “Weird but True” Jamal Munshi reports: “Dr. F. Schmeidler of the Munich University Observatory has published a paper titled “The Einstein Shift An Unsettled Problem,” and a plot of shifts for 92 stars for the 1922 eclipse shows shifts going in all directions, many of them going the wrong way by as large a deflection as those shifted in the predicted direction! Further examination of the 1919 and 1922 data originally interpreted as confirming relativity, tended to favor a larger shift, the results depended very strongly on the manner for reducing the measurements and the effect of omitting individual stars.>So now we find that the legend of Albert Einstein as the world’s greatest scientist was based on the Mathematical Magic of Trimming and Cooking of the eclipse data to present the illusion that Einstein’s general relativity theory was correct in order to prevent Cambridge University from being disgraced because one of its distinguished members [Eddington] was close to being declared a “conscientious objector”.  … …So we should conclude that a certain amount of tricks seems to be necessary to work with succeed in the field of Science…and the claim of that webpage is that they(= P.

However, that changed on September 9, 1915, when the famous scientist Nikola Tesla published an article entitled The Wonder World to be Created by Electricity. In it, he made the following astounding claim:…Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely and minutely arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high tension discharge…The term condenser is an older word for what we now know as a capacitor, or an electrical machine capable of storing energy. Tesla thought that the Ark generated static electricity by causing air to rub against curtains. This created static electricity which was then stored inside the Ark, turning the box into a giant Leyden Jar.Source:http://www.guerrillaexplorer.com/strange-science/ark-of-the-covenant-lost-technology/2)>… after his escape from Egypt, Moses ordered the construction of the Ark of the Covenant to house the tablets of stone on which were written the original “Ten Commandments”. Its construction is described in great detail in the book of Exodus and according to the Bible and Jewish legend it was endowed with miraculous powers including emitting sparks and fire and striking dead Aaron’s sons and others who touched it. It was basically a wooden box of acacia wood lined with gold and also overlaid on the outside with gold. The lid was decorated with two “cherubim” with outstretched wings. In 1915 Nikola Tesla, in an essay entitled “The Fairy Tale of Electricity” promoting the appreciation of electrical developments, proposed what seemed a plausible explanation for some of the magical powers of the Ark. He claimed that the gold sheaths separated by the dry acacia wood effectively formed a large capacitor on which a static electrical charge could be built up by friction from the curtains around the Ark and this accounted for the sparks and the electrocution of Aaron’s sons.>Recent calculations have shown however that the capacitance of the box would be in the order of 200 pico farads and such a capacitor would need to be charged to 100,000 volts to store even 1 joule of electrical energy, not nearly enough to cause electrocution. It seems Tesla’s explanation was appropriately named.Source: http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htmSo…Was the Ark of the Covenant a mysterious biblical piece of ancient technology ?What was the level of electrical knowledge in ancient times?Now we can read something about ancient technology :new technology to explore the ancient Greek Antikythera wreck in the Agean Sea, using an exosuit developed by Nuytco Research.There is the amazing technology of the EXOSUIT atmospheric diving system (ADS)[links : http://nuytco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Exosuit-Specifications.pdfor :   http://nuytco.com/media/in-the-news/or   http://phys.org/news/2014-06-exosuit-explore-ancient-antikythera.html ]and then I hope that they are able to find other interesting proofs because:>The team has scheduled a test run of the suit this summer at a site called the Canyons off the coast of Rhode Island.

Hildebrand (who laid the foundation for solubility theory in his classic work on the solubility of nonelectrolytes in 1916) proposed the square root of the cohesive energy density as a numerical value indicating the solvency behavior of a specific solvent.link:http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/burke/solpar/solpar2.htmlThen Hildebrand solubility parameter for a pure liquid substance is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density.Here I presume you know the heat of vaporization,V(index m) = the molar volume, RT (from the Ideal Gas law[Liter atm / mole K] * K = [L atm / mol] )and the energy of vaporization….The partial pressures of all of the components in a mixture of real gases dependon the types of molecules and the temperature. At constant temperature,the internal energy of a mixture remains constant; however,the partial pressures of the components depend on their “fugacity.”In any case we can expect that the chemical researchers are able to work using the IGC …Unfortunately Rogers passed away in 2005.I can recommand you to read a polish paper (in english) published in 2008:“Inverse gas chromatography as a source of physiochemical data”(read, at the end of this message, the bibliographic reference)because IGC could be called a milestone in testing propertiesof liquid and solid materials.Typical units are hildebrand :1 hildebrand = (1 cal )^1/2 (1 cm)^-3/2 = 0.48888 (Mega Pascal)^1/2 The conventional units for the solubility parameter are (calories per cm3)^1/2, or: (cal)^1/2 (cm)^−3/2.Link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildebrand_solubility_parameterSee also :Hildebrand’s delta.Hildebrand solubility parameter is also known as three-dimensional solubility parameters or HSP because Hansen proposed an extension of the Hildebrand parameterin order to estimate relative miscibility of polar and hydrogen bonding systems.There is a formula to calculate the distance (Ra) between Hansen parameters in Hansen space.Combining this with the interaction radius gives the relative energy difference (RED) of the system (the ratio Ra/R0, where R0 is a value called interaction radius that is given to the substance being dissolved).Historically Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) have been used in industries such as paints and coatings where understanding and controlling solvent/polymer interactions was vital. Over the years their use has been extended widely… Link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansen_solubility_parameterFor molecules whose heats of vaporization can be measured (… or calculated) one can determine the value of delta.There are three delta components (Hansen evaluation system):– dispersion– electrostatic– hydrogen bonding Do you know HSP (= Hansen Solubility Parameters) for myrrhoaloetic oils ?Perhaps you can try to do some easily experiments using methane or propane gasin your cooling room (both are explosive gases when mixed with air: warning, take care!!!).— —I have read that:the retention volume is calculated from the retention timeand the partial pressure from the peak/step height.Since the retention volume represents the first derivation of the adsorbed amount,integration gives the isotherm.Perhaps other bloggers can contributedeveloping this argument…— —As previously wrote I don’t believe in oil’s presence.Years ago I have read something about an“Unguentum Apostolorum”.An oily, viscous substance, indicated by Norma Weller (now a deceased researcher),who also wrote something about an archaeological expert in ancient forms of burial and embalming…IGC can be employed to explore changes in surface energy(see, for example : Corona Discharge treatments, etc. …)IGC became very popular method for the measurementof physico-chemical properties of solid materials.Therefore Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC), at infinite dilution, can be usedto determine thermodynamic parameters of adsorption, such as free energy, enthalpyand entropy, as well as the dispersion component of surface free energy,and the interaction parameter.Then Inverse Gas Chromatography can be an useful tool to usein the case of experiments about thymol treatments (see: the inherent old claims)…I am curious to see what happens with natural linen samples, natural treated linenand modern/commercial linen samples. Perhaps they should show a smaller surface energydue to the additional treating ingredients and processing methods…In any case, I hope in your interesting answers…—————————— Bibliographic references :– D.R.

LinerosApril 14, 2015arxiv:1504.03261under the address:https://www.dmhunters.org/?p=12252>Recently Blum, Katz and Waxman have claimed that the flux of high energy cosmic ray (CR) positrons near Earth that has been measured with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) aboard the International Space Station can be produced in the collisions of Galactic CR protons and nuclei with the ambient matter in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM).Their claim was based on an alleged “robust upper limit to the positron flux” which neglected the energy loss of e+’s in the ISM. Inclusion of this energy loss, however, yields a much smaller upper limit, which excludes secondary production in the ISM by the Galactic cosmic rays as the main origin of the CR e^+ flux above 10 GeV.— — —The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a state-of-the-art particle physics detector designed to operate as an external module on the International Space Station.

The AMS-02 observations will help answer fundamental questions, such as “What makes up the universe’s invisible mass?” or “What happened to the primordial antimatter?”— —Then AMS and AFM are the two different ways to know this World…B.T.W., here what I have found in a new health field:>Nanodentistry is an emerging field with significant potential to yield new generation of technologically advanced clinical tools and devices for oral healthcare. Nanoscale topology and quantitative biomechanical or biophysical analysis of dental surfaces are of significant interest.

However: where is the tomb of St. Joseph? Recently I read a short service on the ancient cult of St. Joseph in Palestine. Along with the article was a picture of the so-called Tomb of the Right or of St. Joseph (which exists at the convent of the Sisters of Nazareth), the text was also quoted an ancient document called Judeo-Christian “Historia Josepi”.According to this ancient report the death and glorification of St. Joseph took place right in the place where according to tradition Jesus revealed his “secret doctrine”, ie on Mount Olivet …The Dominican Milan IsidoroIsolano inserted the History of St. Joseph in his “Summa de donis St. Joseph”, printed in Pavia, in 1522. And in that work the story of Joseph’s life is attributed to Jesus himself, who would confided to the disciples on the Mount of Olives.IsidoroIsolano, who wrote the Summa of the gifts of St. Joseph, said that there will come a time when you will discover riches enclosed in St. Joseph.The Gospel of St. Matthew informs us that the death of Christ, “the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints who had died, resurrected. Coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many “… So: St. Joseph was among them?Another question: the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother of Jesus, is seen by some as the dying and then resurrected and went to heaven. Others (here I refer to one of the many responses given by Our Lady in Medjugorje) seem to deny that Mary is dead!Then: the Blessed Virgin Mary was dead or simply “asleep”?Some theologians, although the precise address expressed years ago by Pope Wojtyla, seems still debating the issue …— — —After these notes, however, I would not be passed to a heretic …St. Joseph by the unanimous opinion of the theologians and the teaching of Blessed Pius IX (Decree Quemadmodum Deus, December 8, 1870), Leo XIII (enciclicaQuamquam pluries, August 15, 1889) and Pius XI (speech of 21 April 1926) exceeds dignity in any other saint of the Old and New Testament Baptist (though John the Baptist died a martyr, shedding his blood, and therefore there is no comparison) and Apostles included.

The mineralogy of the Site 1256 carbonate veins is therefore determined from their Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios, which reveal two distinct groups (Fig. F1; Table T1). The compact calcite structure can incorporate the small Mg cation, whereas aragonite has a larger cation site and favors accommodation of the larger Sr cation (Deer et al., 1992). Samples with Sr/Ca ratios less than ~0.2 mmol/mol are classified as calcite, and those with Mg/Ca ratios of less than ~2.5 mmol/mol are classified as aragonite (Table T1; Fig. F1). The remaining samples, with intermediate compositions (Sr/Ca >0.2 mmol/mol and Mg/Ca >2.5 mmol/mol), are interpreted to be aragonite-calcite mixtures, which were homogenized during hand-picking. >Fe and Mn are similar in diameter to Mg and are therefore also preferentially incorporated into calcite, with Fe/Ca ranging from ~3 to ~35 mmol/mol and Mn/Ca ratios up to ~80 mmol/mol (Fig. F1). The aragonite veins have lower Fe/Ca ratios (The carbonate veins have 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from ~0.70804 to 0.70872. The majority of the aragonite veins have Sr isotopic compositions between ~0.7087 and ~0.7086, whereas the calcite veins precipitated from fluids with 87Sr/86Sr ranging from ~0.7086 to ~0.7080. The strontium isotopic composition of the oceans ~15 m.y. ago was ~0.70875 (Hodell et al., 1991), and it has increased progressively since then. All the carbonate veins precipitated from fluids with 87Sr/86Sr ratios lower than the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio has been since the eruption of the host basalt.

The Greek historian Polybius wrote of Roman funeral rites, so singular to the Hellenic eye, in which the death masks, carefully preserved for generations, would be paraded by descendants in the funeral procession. It was perilously close to ancestor worship and fraught with political meaning for in honoring a lineage of virtuous public service, the funeral procession served to remind Romans of an inheritance that made one fit to govern. It is significant that the masks preserved how a person really looked rather than how he wished to be seen.

Atmos. Environ. 2002, 36, 4823)So, the formation of formaldehyde from combustion processes is well-known.The emission rate is often presented in the unit μg g−1 (mass emittedper mass of material burnt).Lee and Wang measured formaldehyde concentrations up to 300 μg m−3in a 18.26 m3 test chamber when burning incense sticks.The emission rate was 300−1700 μg per g stick.See also wood combustion and cigarette-smoking …Baek and Jenkins measured an average formaldehyde concentrationof 234 μg m−3 when six cigarettes were smoked in a 30 m3 chamberunder almost static conditions. A study by Baker with 13 experimental cigarettes (saccharides added) gave emission rates between 30 μg g−1 and 57 μgper cigarette smoked.In the study by Singer et al., distinctly higher formaldehyde emission rates of 950−1310 μg per cigarette smoked were measured. Maroni et al. report 70−100 μg formaldehyde in the undiluted mainstream smoke of nonfilter cigarettes and 0.2 mg per cigarette in sidestream smoke.

Answer:>All of us have a number of naturally occurring radionuclides within our bodies. The major one that produces penetrating gamma radiation that can escape from the body is a radioactive isotope of potassium, called potassium-40. This radionuclide has been around since the birth of the earth and is present as a tiny fraction of all the potassium in nature.>Potassium-40 (40K) is the primary source of radiation from the human body for two reasons. First, the 40K concentration in the body is fairly high. Potassium is ingested in many foods that we eat and is a critically important element for proper functioning of the human body; it is present in pretty much all the tissues of the body. The amount of the radioactive isotope 40K in a 70-kg person is about 5,000 Bq, which represents 5,000 atoms undergoing radioactive decay each second. >Second, 40K emits gamma rays in a little over 10 percent of its decays and most of these gamma rays escape the body. A gamma ray is emitted in about one out of every 10 disintegrations of 40K, implying that about 500 gamma rays are produced each second. These will be moving in all directions, some will be attenuated in the body, and the dose rate from these gamma rays outside of the individual’s body will represent a very small fraction of the normal background dose rate from all natural sources outside the body. >If a person is above average in weight, the dose rate outside of this person’s body will expectedly be higher than the dose outside the body of a lower-weight individual. In both cases, however, the dose rate will be extremely small compared to the normal background dose rate. The heavier person will receive a greater internal dose because the decay of the 40K produces other low-penetrating radiation (beta radiation) that deposits its energy within the body. However, the dose to the heavier individual will not be significantly different from that to the lower-weight individual because the energy deposited per unit body mass is the dose-determining factor, and this will be about the same for both individuals.>There are many other radionuclides in the human body, but these either are present at lower levels than 40K (for example, 238U, 232Th, and their decay products) or they do not emit gamma rays that can escape the body (for example, 14C and 87Rb). Radon (and its decay products) is not a significant source of radiation from humans because it is present at very low levels in the body. >There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. …Link:http://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/faqradbods.html— — —So, our body (with the normal levels of radiation)can not produce an Image like that of the ShroudThen …Do you think at “enhanced radioactive emissions” as“possible solution” of the problem?But… where is the certified evidence for this particular hypothesis?In any case we need the adequate analyses andI have (previously) indicated (in a rough manner… Sorry)what we can do.I repeat: I prefer to use the AFM techniques in order to properlyinvestigate linen fibrils involved in B.I.F.

Scientists have learned so much about the people of the past from studying mummified human remains, and much of the credit goes directly to the oils and perfumes that still reside within the bodies.Scented oils were used as early as 10,000 BCE to help combat body odor and to soften the skin. Some of the most common scents used by the Egyptians were thyme, lavender, peppermint, cedar, rose, almond oil, and aloe. While providing a definitive use in life, these scents also had a purpose in death – namely, the process of Egyptian mummification.

The likely elimination of a Mystery of Faith!

B.T.W. : Isaac Newton wrote fellow alchemist Robert Boyle a letter urging him to keep “high silence” in publicly discussing the principles of alchemy…]) during centuries … and sometimes fallible … really it is not infallible …If science comes to really explain a mystery of Faith, then it seems to me possible to infer that the Mystery, in a certain sense, is no longer a mystery, it has become something demonstrated that one can not subtract, and, consequentially, the degree of freedom of man facing a Mystery revealed it is involved …— * — * —I’d be really curious (and at the same time, almost very intimidated …) if the predictions of Lindner (= radiocarbon dates move into the future!) come true (established after the appropriate controls) …In fact: what sense could have that “radiocarbon date in the future,” seen as “proof of the Resurrection”?In that case we would have still kept our freedom?No doubt it would be a major stumbling block … and perhaps the only logical explanation that would be immediately indicated would be the objection that these radiocarbon results in the future would result from netron irradiation of the Cloth, presumably in modern times …Strange stories …Perhaps it is better to work in our field more restricted.

Due to the high linear energy transfer value, sensors designed to detect such radiation require placement in close proximity to the radiation source. Here we report the morphological changes and optical responses of artificially designed DNA thin films in response to exposure to alpha radiation as observed by an atomic force microscope, a Raman and a reflectance spectroscopes. In addition, we discuss the feasibility of a DNA thin film as a radiation sensing material. The effect of alpha radiation exposure on the DNA thin film was evaluated as a function of distance from an 241Am source and exposure time. Significant reflected intensity changes of the exposed DNA thin film suggest that a thin film made of biomolecules can be one of promising candidates for the development of online radiation sensors.— —The unexpected nuclear accidents = See also: The Fukushima nuclear accident on March 2011, etc. …The radiation effect on thin films was also studied using Ramanspectroscopic analysis to determine the influence of exposure timeand the distance of the film from the radiation source.Then, please, observe the comparative Raman spectrawithout and with radiation exposure…The radiation source (in that work) 241Am, emits alpha particles.And alpha particles, consisting of helium nuclei, are emittedby various isotopes of actinides including Th, U, Np, Pu, Am and Cm. …So it remains to see the composition of the stones of the wallswhere the Holy Shroud was guarded.For example: I would start examining some site of Turin ….What do you think of this “obvious idea”?Link:http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130624/srep02062/full/srep02062.html","date":"January 20, 2015 at 12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/19/jeffrey-skurka-on-buffalo-catholic-radio-station/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jeffrey Skurka on Buffalo Catholic Radio Station"},{"author":"piero","post":"Here I want to consider another time the following questionable statement(taken from the words by Siefker) :>The body image would lose its optical properties, a result of alignment being lostover time possibly just by moving the cloth through earth’s magnetic fieldsuch as when the cloth is being transported.(“The Enigma of the Apparent Age of the Shroud of Turin … etc. …”, slide 67 of 112)because, in my opinion, this is a too vague hypothesis …Where is the true proof on linen fibrils ?Where are inherent experiments or useful references ?Yesterday I didn’t consider the questions:What were the exact conditions during the transport of the relic to/from Montevergine (Avellino)?Who was the responsible about the (possible) photographic controls?

Such forces are potentially damaging, particularly to thin or delicate samples. Recently, researchers have demonstrated a solution to this dilemma. The new method enables AFM measurements of elastic modulus with forces less than 20 nN, roughly 10 times the force needed to break a single atomic bond.— —Jason P Killgore and Donna C Hurley 2012 Nanotechnology 23 055702 doi:10.1088/0957-4484/23/5/055702Low-force AFM nanomechanics with higher-eigenmode contact resonance spectroscopy link :http://iopscience.iop.org/0957-4484/23/5/055702/>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods for quantitative measurements of elastic modulus on stiff (>10 GPa) materials typically require tip–sample contact forces in the range from hundreds of nanonewtons to a few micronewtons. Such large forces can cause sample damage and preclude direct measurement of ultrathin films or nanofeatures. Here, we present a contact resonance spectroscopy AFM technique that utilizes a cantilever’s higher flexural eigenmodes to enable modulus measurements with contact forces as low as 10 nN, even on stiff materials. Analysis with a simple analytical beam model of spectra for a compliant cantilever’s fourth and fifth flexural eigenmodes in contact yielded good agreement with bulk measurements of modulus on glass samples in the 50–75 GPa range. In contrast, corresponding analysis of the conventionally used first and second eigenmode spectra gave poor agreement under the experimental conditions. We used finite element analysis to understand the dynamic contact response of a cantilever with a physically realistic geometry. Compared to lower eigenmodes, the results from higher modes are less affected by model parameters such as lateral stiffness that are either unknown or not considered in the analytical model. Overall, the technique enables local mechanical characterization of materials previously inaccessible to AFM-based nanomechanics methods.—————————————————-There are two systems :flexural tests and indentation tests…For this second system, see the nanoindentation :>Nanoindentation is a variety of indentation hardness tests applied to small volumes. Indentation is perhaps the most commonly applied means of testing the mechanical properties of materials. The nanoindentation technique was developed in the mid-1970s to measure the hardness of small volumes of material…http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoindentation— —Here a vague reference (not in the field of textiles) :Calculation of Young’s modulus value by means of AFM.Roa JJ, Oncins G, Diaz J, Sanz F, Segarra M.Recent Pat Nanotechnol. 2011 Jan;5(1):27-36.Abstract>In the last years, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has become a powerful tool not only to study the surface morphology but also the nanomechanics of all kind of samples. In this paper, the applicability of this technique is reviewed and its basic aspects of operation, advantages and drawbacks of using the AFM probe as a picoindenter (Force Spectroscopy mode, FS-AFM) are discussed. The patents concerning picoindentation measurements are discussed in the text and special attention is paid to measurements performed on hard materials as ceramics, as they have not been as thoroughly reviewed in the literature as in the case of soft matter.

Sorry!):>September 1939: six days after the German invasion of Poland, the sacred cloth according to the Christians has wrapped the body of Christ in the Sepulchre left Turin for the first time in almost four centuries. Destination, dark abbey avellinese: Montevergine. Officially, it was necessary to protect the only relic from the bombing, but the real fear was that he could throw another cross over its shadow: the Nazi swastika …>Among the documents consulted showed a singular fact: Cardinal Fossati, Archbishop of Turin, had not even been informed of the start of the Holy Shroud in Turin on 7 September 1939. One possible reason may have been the need for the Cardinal, not knowing this, he could not talk even under torture. He would go to Montevergine, after the war, to bring the Holy Shroud in Turin after obtaining the consent of King Umberto II, now in exile for a few months: a consensus being essential property of the House of Savoy, the Shroud. In a letter dated June 10, 1946, just three days before departure for exile, Umberto II wrote to Cardinal Fossati: “The current events lead me today to tell Your Eminence that – while it is my understanding that the precious relic remains sacred and inalienable heritage of my house – do right now my full consent to that returns to its pristine placement in Turin, in the chapel which bears the name. ”>In an exchange of ideas with the researcher and historian Lucan, Dr. Paul Tritto, revealed an interesting argument about a book by Giorgio Galli entitled “Hitler and magical Nazism.”[Here my note = …B.T.W.: I have bought that book several years ago…]>Tritto writes: “In the book of Galli you will find something on the relationship between the Nazis and the esoteric. Upon reading I thought credible reconstructions of Galli. Even today, I think largely valid, but Galli ends, perhaps unwittingly, to draw a picture which comes from outside the usual Hitler schizophrenic. Instead, I believe that Hitler had a vision too shiny to be conceived by the mind of a deranged. Sure, it was totally out of the normal. But I would not speak of schizophrenia; perhaps his was a diabolical design or even the result of a personality “possessed”. Perhaps it is a case of demonic possession. I do not think, therefore, that Hitler wanted to take possession of the Shroud for esoteric rites. In my opinion the Shroud had to represent for him the symbol of something, then had a meaning more realistic. I also cite another book “Conversations with Hitler” Hermann Rauschning. In a chapter called “the Antichrist” the author refers to private conversations in which Hitler had explicitly expressed the intention “of radically eradicate Christianity in Germany with all its roots and its branches.” But it is not a simple hostility to support this diabolical plan, there is rather the intention of usurping the place of the Catholic Church in its mission to redeem humanity. Rauschning reports that Hitler once said: “I want to reveal a secret. Foundations with an Order. “The goal, says Rauschning, was to transform the SS into a kind of caste of priests secrets. The same author also reports that one day a woman in his entourage gave Hitler a strange suggestion that seems to have influenced him; she advised him to follow the path of “white magic” and be wary instead from “black magic”. The most powerful talisman of white magic is considered quite the Holy Shroud. Perhaps it was this – concludes Paul Tritto – the path that led Hitler to design of possession. ”— — —But luckily in Germany not everyone thought like Hitler!Unfortunately>On 19 January 1944 Moltke was arrested and the Kreisau Circle fell into disarray. The focus of some circle members had been turning towards an active political coup, and some participated in the failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler by Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg on July 20, 1944. After the failure of this plot, many members of the Circle were arrested and were executed.Libnk:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreisau_CircleSo I wonder how a highly efficient information network could not knowanything about the fate of the Shroud. … Do they thought that this relicwas transferred to Monte Cassino?In each case the systems of intelligence (= Monarchy and Vatican) had been effective in hiding the information to the German Nazis …Maybe you can make a comparison with a “parallel case”,namely that of “The Library of the Jewish Community of Rome” …Today there is an article in an italian newspaper (“Corriere della Sera”)about that “Library of the Jewish Community of Rome”,this article is titled:“Roman Jews (and the police) chasing the stolen library.”>In 1943 the Nazi raid to document the “lost civilization”.>Lost track of 7000 volumes.

It was previously thought that the surface tension of tears was due to dissolved mucin, but it has recently been shown that very little mucin is present. The surface tensions of solutions of commercial mucin, lysozyme, lactoferrin or secretory IgA are all higher than that of tears. The influence of tear lipocalin and lipids remained to be tested. Methods. Surface tension was determined by a micro-method on pooled. intact stimulated human tears, and following extraction with lipid solvents. The extracted material was also added back, as was a variety of lipid standards (phospholipids, glycolipids, sterols, etc.). TLC and GLC were used in partial identification of the extract. Another lipocalin, bovine ß-lactoglobulin, was also tested alone and mixed with tear lipids, model lipids, or model tear proteins. Results. Intact tears had a surface tension of 42-46 mN/m, but after lipid extraction this rose to 53-55.5 mN/m. Addition of lipids to the delipidised tear fluid gave a range of tensions from 42 to 49 mN/m, with the greatest effects shown by phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin), but full recovery was only achieved by using the extracted lipid material. … … etc. … …Link: http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1076/ceyr.19.1.4.5341— —So…I hope to read no irreverent comments on these easysuggestions of “AFM research on linens sprayed on by tears”.I personally, I have doubts about the level of absorption of tearsby the linen (it’s a question of the surface tension for both:linen and  tears)…What is your opinion ?","date":"May 4, 2015 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/03/three-millions-page-views/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Three Millions Page Views"},{"author":"piero","post":"Here another very “very particular” question connected to the tearsand to the Purkinje images, that are reflections of objectsfrom the structure of the eye…>…They are also known as Purkinje reflexes andas Purkinje-Sanson images…Link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_imagesHere the question:What is the effect of tears on Purkinje images?I refer to the presumed “Purkinje images” presenton the famous tilma of Guadalupe…Link:","date":"May 4, 2015 at 8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/03/three-millions-page-views/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Three Millions Page Views"},{"author":"piero","post":"I beg your pardon for eventual translation error that occurred,in any case the old italian article wrote:>With SEM, the scanning electron microscope which identified the image by mapping the chemical paper fibers were examined points of slobber/blur/smudge: “We realized that there are salts of potassium and chlorine of their tears, but at the same time that the paper was processed with chlorine” did say the biologist.>For more information, you should, however, take the material and analyze the DNA, but this goes against the principles of restoration: “For ethical choice, we can not do destructive analysis.

PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all. On the other hand, PLSR does take the response variable into account, and therefore often leads to models that are able to fit the response variable with fewer components. Whether or not that ultimately translates into a more parsimonious model, in terms of its practical use, depends on the context.— —->… These data are described in Kalivas, John H., “Two Data Sets of Near Infrared Spectra,” Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, v.37 (1997) pp.255-259.Link:http://it.mathworks.com/help/stats/examples/partial-least-squares-regression-and-principal-components-regression.html—- —The Collinearity Problem in Linear Regression.

By varying the upper bound of correlation coefficient between absorbance and analyte’s content, the CCO-PLS method achieved multi-band selection. Two PLS-based methods, which used a waveband having positive peaks of the first loading vector (FLV) and a combination of positive peaks of the correlation coefficient spectrum, were also conducted for comparison. Based on the leave-one-out cross-validation for CCO-PLS, appropriate waveband combinations for ALB and GLB were selected, the root-mean-square errors of prediction for validation samples were 1.36 and 1.35 (g L−1) for ALB and GLB, respectively, which were better than the two comparison methods. The CCO-PLS method provided a new approach for multi-band selection to achieve high analytical accuracy for molecular absorption bands that were composed of several spaced wavebands.— — —Dear “daveb of wellington nz”,perhaps our friend Colin knows the article:“PLS regression methods”byAgnar Höskuldsson.It’s an article first published online: 30 Mar 2005.Original article in “Journal of Chemometrics”,Volume 2, Issue 3, pages 211–228, June 1988Abstract>In this paper we develop the mathematical and statistical structure of PLS regression.

Any such hesitations, however, form no part of the Pope’s thinking.>Laudato Si’ appears closely to reflect the influence of the environmentalist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a pillar of the UN’s tendentiously political Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), who has been described in the New York Times as “a scientist known for his aggressive stance on climate policy” and who the Pope recently appointed to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, despite his other beliefs (he is hardly a Catholic thinker).>As the Vatican correspondent Edward Pentin comments: “Critics have warned that by falling in with proponents of climate change science, the Pope risks getting too close to other key supporters of the theory who support population control and abortion.”>Schellnhuber, perhaps not surprisingly given his current prominence as a papal adviser, claims not to be in favour of population control, but that is of course ridiculous, and even in the recent interview with Pentin in which he is taken to be repudiating the idea of limiting the world’s population, he can’t hide his real underlying assumptions. >Here he is: “If you want to reduce human population, there are wonderful means: Improve the education of girls and young women. Then the demographic transition will be a little bit faster… So I subscribe to a good education, and that’s the only way of population strategy I would support.”In other words, teach the girls about artificial birth control. “If you want to reduce human population”, he says. Well, there’s no if about it: the fact is that he clearly does want to reduce the human population. That’s population control. It is nonsense for him to deny he’s not in favour of it. Does he think we are all fools? >Parts of the encyclical are crude in the extreme. “A number of scientific studies indicate,” says Pope Francis, though without specifying which, “that most [that’s right, he says ‘most’] global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly [I repeat “mainly”] as a result of human activity.”Actually, only about five per cent of present atmospheric carbon dioxide is derived from the use of fossil fuels; that is, just 19 parts of CO2 per million parts of atmosphere. Most CO2 is a natural part of the atmosphere. It is not pollution: indeed, human life is largely dependent on it since without CO2 there could be no growth of any kind of vegetable matter: no CO2, no trees. No trees, no oxygen. And yet Francis writes that “Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain”: It’s a dubious theory put forward by some: but it is far from having been proved.>The danger of getting too closely involved in the politics of climate change is that they destructively divert our attention, (and that “our” includes the Pope himself), from a political imperative one would have thought much closer to the heart of what Francis, and with him the Church, really cares about. He has always claimed, with evident sincerity, to be on the side of the poor. And yet he attacks fossil fuels, their chief energy source, which he does admit are “at the heart of the worldwide energy system”.… … etc. … … etc. …Link:http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2015/06/24/following-st-francis-the-pope-teaches-concern-for-nature-but-laudato-si-will-bring-no-justice-for-the-poor/So…What is your own opinion ?— — — —So, after a while we will find ourselves discussingabout ecology and maybe also around the “misteries” about Rennes-le-Chateau!Then I believe that it is necessary to knowhow to properly separate the arguments andthen treat them one by one, with great patience! …Now I apologize for my vehemence.","date":"June 26, 2015 at 11:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/was-laudato-si-and-the-popes-visit-to-the-shroud-related/","cat":"2015","title":"Was Laudato Si and the Pope’s Visit to the Shroud Related?"},{"author":"piero","post":"Louis,I think the fact of simply repeating a title andthen not to try to comment the entire article(… something that, unfortunately, I have not evenmanaged to do myself) I do not think solves the problem…Or not?In any case I would be curious to read the opinion ofthe Holy Father about the 2006 documentary filmdirected by Davis Guggenheim about former United StatesVice President Al Gore’s campaign to educate citizensabout global warming …Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth>Gore became interested in global warming when he took a course at Harvard University with Professor Roger Revelle, one of the first scientists to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.>Later, when Gore was in Congress, he initiated the first congressional hearing on the subject in 1981.>Gore’s 1992 book, Earth in the Balance, dealing with a number of environmental topics, reached the New York Times bestseller list …Useful links:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_curvehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmospherehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warminghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathwayshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gaseshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering","date":"June 27, 2015 at 9:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/was-laudato-si-and-the-popes-visit-to-the-shroud-related/","cat":"2015","title":"Was Laudato Si and the Pope’s Visit to the Shroud Related?"},{"author":"piero","post":"I have read your interesting discussions …I agree with some comment sent about the “commercial book”.But Giulio Fanti is a Professors of Mechanical Engineeringand  we presume he was able to work with the adequate experiments .Then we have to wait before to read the report about the inherent experiments.In my opinion it’s impossible to condemn (… perhaps out of season ?) a work (as someof you are trying to do ) before to read that work !Then there is the possibility to improve the discussion about  the importantpoint indicated by Hugh Farey, probably  :“the shroud fragments sucked out with a vacuum cleaner are likely to bemore degraded, and thus give an apparently older age for the shroud than it really is…”Then :Where are the right indications ?Where is the right work ?In my idea we have to work using the fibrils taken in the past and keepedin a safe place.

In particular, parameters such as the high photon flux, the small source size and the low divergence attained at the synchrotron make it a very efficient source for a range of advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques, adapted to the heterogeneity and great complexity of the materials under study. The continuous tunability of the source — its very extended energy distribution over wide energy domains (meV to keV) with a high intensity — is an essential parameter for techniques based on a very fine tuning of the probing energy to reach high chemical sensitivity such as XANES, EXAFS, STXM, UV/VIS spectrometry, etc. The small source size attained (a few micrometres) at least in the vertical plane leads to spatial coherence of the photon beams, giving rise in turn to a series of imaging methods already crucial to the field. This review of the existing literature shows that microfocused hard X-ray spectroscopy (absorption, fluorescence, diffraction), full-field X-ray tomography and infrared spectroscopy are the leading synchrotron techniques in the field, and presents illustrative examples of the study of ancient and historical materials for the various methods. Fast developing analytical modalities in scanning spectroscopy (STXM, macro-XRF scanning) and novel analytical strategies regarding optics, detectors and other instrumental developments are expected to provide major contributions in the years to come. Other energy domains are increasingly being used or considered such as far-infrared and ultraviolet/visible for spectroscopy and imaging. We discuss the main instrumental developments and perspectives, and their impact for the science being made on ancient materials using synchrotron techniques.","date":"February 20, 2014 at 10:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"author":"piero","post":"Thank you for your answers !In the past I have read something on odd-ratio and bookmaker rule …Sorry…As you have seen I get lost writing something (… of superabundant ?) on laminographic controls (this kind of analyses can be useful in parchement study.

Millikan was deeply interested in ‘The Secret Doctrine’. …— — —Sylvia Cranston demonstrated that Einstein was a long-time student of “The Secret Doctrine”, the masterpiece written by Mrs. Blavatsky. See “HPB – The Extraordinary Life and Influence of Helena Blavatsky, Founder of the Mode rn Theosophical Movement”, by Sylvia Cranston, a Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam Book, published by G.P.

XX;  pp. 434-435;  and note 22 to Part 7 of the book, at pp. 605-606.— —‘The Secret Doctrine’ was the crowning achievement for the literary works of HP Blavatsky. The first volume is primarily concerned with the evolution of the Universe. The backbone of this volume consists of seven rooms, translated from the Book of Dzyan, with commentary and explanation of HPB In this volume there is also an extensive elucidation of the fundamental symbols contained in the great religions and mythologies of the world. The second volume contains a further series of rooms from ‘The Book of Dzyan’ which describes the evolution of Humanity…— — *** *** — —Instead Saint Luke is believed by many scholars to be a Greek physician who lived in the Greek city of Antioch in Ancient Syria, though some other scholars and theologians think Luke was a Hellenic Jew…Links (about the Ancient Hellenistic World):As Jesus prayed on the mount of Olives, “his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground” (Lk. 22:44). Did blood actually come from the Lord’s skin, or is the language merely a figure of speech emphasizing the Savior’s agony? The only New Testament writer to mention this phenomenon is Luke, a physician (Col. 4:14).Here I should write a few lines on the ancient medical knowledge and the visual examination of the Shroud …I believe that the Shroud has nothing to do with Madame Blavatsky, but … See also the possible (or impossible) connections:Shroud-Antioch-theory by Markwardt-St Luke and the Shroud…The idea of Messiah can also be found in Buddhism, where the bodhisattva Maitreya plays a similar function as a Messiah… It is said that Maitreya’s coming will occur after the teachings of the current Buddha Gautama, the Dharma, are no longer taught and are completely forgotten…Now I apologize for the possible (great) confusion (!) occurred with the use of a series of mental associations (perhaps not always entirely consistent) … But yesterday I have spent some time rereading a book by prof. P.L. Baima Bollone:“L’ identità di Gesù. La vera storia di Gesù Bambino” (= The identity of Jesus. The true story of the Child Jesus.).This book breaks away from misconceptions  (and in that book there are also reported interesting theosophical and anthroposophic  tracks) and try to trace the identity of Jesus and the events of his birth on the basis of biological and natural that can be seen in the sources. Theosophy teaches the unity of man and the equality of all races, creeds, color and sex. Blavatsky believed in the world religions, and the coming of the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, the Ajita Bodhisattva, “that would return to teach the pure Dharma, at a time of darkness on the earth, when the Dharma will have been forgotten.” ( Wikipedia)So…  Blavatsky believed the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, is linked to the Return of Jesus and the other ascendant masters. Blavatsky talked of a so-called Christ Principle, which in her view corresponds to the spiritual essence of every human being.Maitreya is a bodhisattva who in the Buddhist tradition is to appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor of the historic Śākyamuni Buddha. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya references a time when the Dharma will seem to be forgotten on Jambudvipa. … In his eulogy to Isaac Newton written in 1927, the bicentenary of the great man’s death, Einstein called him a “shining spirit”. But I do not think there is a real parallel between Einstein (= science, theosophy, politics, etc.) And Newton (= science, alchemy!).

ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ, variant form Abrasax, ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ) was a word of mystic meaning in the system of the Gnostic Basilides, being there applied to the “Great Archon” (Gk., megas archōn), the princeps of the 365 spheres (Gk., ouranoi).[1] The seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the seven classic planets—Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn …>The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung wrote a short Gnostic treatise in 1916 called The Seven Sermons to the Dead, which called Abraxas a god higher than the Christian God and devil that combines all opposites into one being. (= “There is a God about whom you know nothing, because men have forgotten him. We call him by his name: Abraxas. He is less definite than God or Devil…”)>The magic word “Ablanathanalba,” which reads in Greek the same backward as forward, also occurs in the Abrasax-stones as well as in the magic papyri. This word is usually conceded to be derived from the Hebrew (Aramaic), meaning “Thou art our father” (אב לן את), and also occurs in connection with Abrasax…Link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraxas— — —In short, what I mean is that believers in God can not stay too anchored to a given cosmology … that maybe it can also be false.In this Scientific American interview with physicist George F.R.

Three proteins have been purified by immunohistological methods and located to specific regions of the byssus. A collagenous protein with subunit molecular weights of 53,000, 55,000 and 65,000 is found in the matrix of the elastic thread region. Its 73,000-MW precursor was extracted from foot glands in the area proximal to the animal body and was identified by immune cross-reactivity. A cystine-rich, acidic protein was found in all regions of the byssus associated with a third protein, the polyphenolic protein. The L-dopa-containing polyphenolic protein appears in the cortex of the entire thread and adhesive plaque and at the substrate-plaque interface. Antiserum to this protein stains spherical vesicles in the phenol gland of the foot. Using immuno-electrophoretic methods, the polyphenolic protein and the cystine-rich protein were shown to form high molecular weight aggregates with aging of the byssus.","date":"September 4, 2014 at 6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/02/manoppello-shroud-and-durer-a-short-presentation-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Manoppello, Shroud and Durer:  A Short Presentation by O.K."},{"author":"piero","post":"Continuation of the notes:>Le linceul arrive à Montfort par la famille de Vergy propriétaire du château de Montfort au XVe siècle.>Cette famille serait entrée en possession de cette relique grâce à Othon de la Roche, croisé bourguignon de la quatrième croisade, qui l’aurait pris pendant le sac de Constantinople en 1204.

It was found that the microwaves of centimetre-wavelengths and their harmonics can produce an accelerated rotation of the water dipole-molecules, and this effect can have as a result the dehydration process – the ‘driving out’ of water dipole-molecules from the smallest cavities and projecting them in the open air. This is exactly the process of electromagnetic dehydration.”4 Similarly, dehydrated cellulose of the Shroud fibrils is the cause of the image according to STURP, not paint, pigments, or other substances5.>Although not fully understood or accepted by mainstream science, some physicists do believe that the pyramid is, not only an accumulator of energies, but also a modifier of these same energies. It is recognized that any object in which energy vibrates is capable of acting as a resonating cavity.

All the experiments that have attempted to reproduce the Shroud image copies produced by chemical-physical characteristics very different from those of the original… and Prof. Barberis concluded: “In short, the process that caused the formation of the image remains unknown”This is what we have always heard…Although there are systems of investigation which have become refined [For example: I have pointed out the possibility of using the CFM (= Chemical Force Microscopy) and AFM-Raman techniques…], I certainly don’t pretend to reveal exactly how it was formed the Shroud (ie: what was the exact process of the formation of the Imprint), what interested me in 1998, and the main point for which I am still very interested, is the problem of the dating of the Shroud.We can see ourselves the strange fact: after the intervention of Freeman (and its stress on the stories “Quem Queritis” …) and after the publication of this interesting book by Andrea Nicolotti, the assumptions on the date of origin of the Shroud now are made to converge to the Middle Ages because of a dating occurred on one corner of the Ancient Sheet … One angle can deny everything else we know?

In March 2010, scientists announced the discovery of a finger bone fragment of a juvenile female who lived about 41,000 years ago, found in the remote Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia, a cave which has also been inhabited by Neanderthals and modern humans.[1][2][3] Two teeth and a toe bone belonging to different members of the same population have since been reported.>Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the finger bone showed it to be genetically distinct from the mtDNAs of Neanderthals and modern humans.>Subsequent study of the nuclear genome from this specimen suggests that this group shares a common origin with Neanderthals, that they ranged from Siberia to Southeast Asia, and that they lived among and interbred with the ancestors of some present-day modern humans, with about 3% to 5% of the DNA of Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians deriving from Denisovans.>DNA discovered in Spain suggests that Denisovans at some point resided in Western Europe, where Neanderthals were thought to be the only inhab— — —Perhaps the account of Eve is an interesting and important segment of our genetic history.

The Jerusalem samples are further identified as in the École Biblique tomb complex and more particularly from the bench of the tomb.”>2. … … omitted … …>3. – How was the Aragonite identified from Jerusalem?>Kohlbeck analysed with the microscope thin sections of the Jerusalem tomb and he concluded was Aragonite. The strongest way to distinguish Aragonite from Calcite is the X-ray diffraction to determine the crystalline structure. However, this test was never mentioned. But Kohlbeck should be able to recognize through the microscope the aragonite versus the common calcite. Nevertheless, this is not the key question because actually, Aragonite is very spread and very common. It should be easy to find Aragonite in the Jerusalem rock and in the Shroud too and its presence in the Shroud cannot be taken as a clue of its stay in Jerusalem. Only specific traces (iron and strontium) could give an indicative fingerprint. Kohlbeck applied the X-Ray fluorescence method to detect traces of iron and strontium and being not able to find lead.It is the further analysis conducted by Dr. Riccardo Levi-Setti through his high-resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy that provided the true “little DNA” or “finger print” to be compared with the samples of the Shroud (fibers).link:http://www.holyshroudguild.org/cesar2.html— — —SIMS link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_ion_mass_spectrometry— — —>Ion microprobes, also known as secondary ion mass spectrometers (SIMS), use a finely focused ion beam to probe a selected sample domain.  A small percentage of the material sputtered from the polished surface of the sample is ionized, and these ions are accelerated into a mass spectrometer where they are separated according to their mass-over-charge ratio.  An important characteristic of SIMS is its high sensitivity compared to other microbeam sampling techniques: the ability to count individual ions results in detection limits in the parts-per-billion range for many elements.  Also the fact that ions derived from the sample are separated by their mass-over-charge ratio allows isotopic analyses to be performed on test portion masses that can be as small as 200 picograms.

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are one group of nanoparticles that have high potential economic value but present substantial challenges to the development of the measurement science. Even the largest trees owe their strength to this newly appreciated class of nanomaterials. Cellulose is the world’s most abundant natural, renewable, biodegradable polymer. Cellulose occurs as whisker-like microfibrils that are biosynthesized and deposited in plant material in a continuous fashion. The nanocrystals are isolated by hydrolyzing away the amorphous segments leaving the acid resistant crystalline fragments. Therefore, the basic raw material for new nanomaterial products already abounds in nature and is available to be utilized in an array of future materials. However, commercialization requires the development of efficient manufacturing processes and nanometrology to monitor quality. This paper discusses some of the instrumentation, metrology and standards issues associated with the ramping up for production and use of CNCs.Link:http://iopscience.iop.org/0957-0233/22/2/024005— — — — — — — — — —Here other references… – about the Transverse Modulus:Transverse Elasticity of CelluloseNanocrystals Via Atomic Force MicroscopybyRyan Wagner, Arvind Raman, and Robert Moon– bout cell walls:Micromechanics of Cell WallsbyIngo Burgert and John W.C.

GibsonDOI: 10.1098/rsif.2012.0341Published 7 November 2012AbstractThe cell walls in plants are made up of just four basic building blocks: cellulose (the main structural fibre of the plant kingdom) hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. Although the microstructure of plant cell walls varies in different types of plants, broadly speaking, cellulose fibres reinforce a matrix of hemicellulose and either pectin or lignin. The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb-like cells of wood to the closed-cell, liquid-filled foam-like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young’s modulus varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to 30 GPa in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to over 300 MPa in dense palm. The moduli and compressive strength of plant materials span this entire range.

Here a question connected with a phenomenon…I have read that color intensity of Ferric Oxide can changein direct proportion to changes in atmospheric humidity.Do you agree on that?Another question connected with the previous fact:Accetta and Baumgart noted variations in the spectrum on the TSwhen they conducted their infrared reflectance spectroscopy and thermographicinvestigations.

Craig,even if very interesting and capable to reproduce many of thephysico-chemical characteristics of the Shroud of Turin,was not able to reproduce some typical characteristics ofthe Shroud detectable at microscopic level!!!Here my simple conclusion:The idea to work in a similar manner seems to be an useless attempt to discredit the Shroud !!!Am I wrong in my claim?Try to work using iron oxide, raw sienna, gelatin transferred to clean dry linen…and observe the results obtained (at macro and micro-levels [= observations with a microscope]).Observe also the effects from the experiments with water stains…—————————————————-Other references:https://www.shroud.com/comment2.htm= Comments From Previous Years 1996-2000REACTIONS to the Emily A.

In addition, many pollen grains are coated with a viscous liquid, “pollenkitt”, thought to play important roles in pollen dispersion and adhesion.>However, there exist no quantitative studies of the effects of solid surface features or pollenkitt on adhesion of pollen grains, and it remains unclear what role these features play in pollen adhesion and transport.>We report AFM adhesion measurements of five pollen species with a series of test surfaces in which each pollen has a unique solid surface morphology and pollenkitt volume.>The results indicate that the combination of surface morphology (size and shape of echinate or reticulate features) with the pollenkitt volume provides pollens with aremarkably tunable adhesion to surfaces. THERE ARE TWO ALTERNATIVES :>With pollenkitt removed, pollen grains had relatively low adhesion strengths that were independent of surface chemistry and scalable with the tip radius of the pollen’s ornamentation features, according to the Hamaker model.>With the pollenkitt intact, adhesion was up to 3–6 times higher than the dry grains and exhibited strong substrate dependence.— —What is your own conclusion ?— —Here I want to add another excerptfrom the Abstract:>The combination of high pollenkitt volume and large convex,spiny surface features in echinate entomophilous varietiesappears to enhance the spreading area of the liquid pollenkitt relativeto varieties of pollen with less pollenkitt volume and lesspronounced surface features.—- —- — —What is pollenkitt? Link:http://www.honeybeesuite.com/2010/03/page/2/>Pollenkitt is a sticky covering found on the surface of pollen grains.It is also spelled “pollen kit” or “pollenkit” and is sometimes called “pollen coat.”It is found in some plant families more often than others, but it is especially common in plants that are pollinated by insects. Because of this, scientists believe that one of the major functions of pollenkitt is to help the pollen stick to the bugs.>Honey bees have special body parts where they pack pollen to be carried back to the hive. The parts—one on each hind leg—are called corbiculae or “pollen baskets.” The corbiculae are covered with hairs which help to hold the pollen in place, but very sticky pollen can form large clumps—something that makes provisioning even easier.>The pollen from many wind pollinated plants, such as grass, is much drier and not nearly so sticky. This pollen has to be carried in smaller clumps and so the bees have to make more trips to collect an equal amount, which wastes both time and energy. … …>Plants that are insect pollinated not only have sticky pollen, they have lots of pollen. This provides the win-win relationship that defines plant-pollinator mutualisms. … ..>Researchers have suggested many other reasons for pollenkitt and, in truth, it probably has multiple functions. It may keep the pollen from blowing away or drying out, or it may protect the pollen from ultra-violet radiation and certain pathogens.— —I hope in your comments …","date":"August 1, 2014 at 12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/28/a-new-paper-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A New Paper by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"piero","post":"The religious idea of resurrection was already known in ancient Egypt.Osiris was the Resurrected Savior-God of life and of death.>…Osiris was the hope of everyman.

Giuseppe Ghiberti and his life in Turin, but the haughty approachby Louis about the biblical studies by Ghiberti and the attempt to dialoguewith another religion during a meeting is a bit strange …or worrying….Here I want to add few lines:although I understand the critical situation (and the urgent need to dialogue to prevent extremist acts from both followers),it’s hard to believe that Muslims [apart the strange heretic sect Ahmadhija, well known for particular ideas andstrange interests about Jesus, the Rozabal, etc.] and Christians find common ground on the Shroud.Here another question (apparently far from the subject treated here):Ludvik Leibler is a French physicist who has developed a revolutionary new techniqueabout the use of a nanoparticle solution made from polymers to connect human tissue.He has been awarded with Descartes-Huygens Prize (a prize set up by the French and Dutchgovernments in 1995). In the past he won an ACS Award in Polymer Chemistry for his pioneering workon the self-assembly of polymer systems.If we wiil be able to show the true epoch of the Ancient Linen (without to destroy the Holy Shroud!),but I don’t believe we will be in the list for these future Awards if we are not able to do something instead todiscuss about the Koran.This question seems to be very important and all the scientists(independently from their religious ideas. See also the example of Pontifical Academia…)can collaborate in order to discover the truth. So, the words by Msgr. Ghiberti should be an interesting point  to start toward this direction.But, knowing something about the ideas of Pallavicini (who seemed to be rigorous about Tradition, etc.),I have some doubt… because I believe thee approach by Co.re.is (Islamic religious community) to the Christian worldand Tradition is a knotty problem.I like the idea nevertheless, then I hope in that possible inter-religious (and also scientific, if possible…) dialogue…There is a German book that can be indicated as an exemple of  what some layman can read about the Shroud:Das Jesu Komplott, by Holger Kersten and Elmar Gruber( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Kersten ) and then a particular Islamic Tradition  (connected with these ideas) can be understood [= the first book by Holger Kersten: “Jesus Lived in India” promotes the claims both of Nicolas Notovich (1894) regarding the unknown years of Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30 in India, also Ahmadiyya founder Ghulam Ahmad’s claims regarding the years aged 33 to age 120 in India, and the burial of Jesus at the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar]. But I don’t believe that Pallavicini is in this field of Islamic Tradition, then a more refined Knowledge (avoiding blasphemies!) is requiredto discuss a Mystery of Faith, this is an useful way for both religious fields.Perhaps there are several studies connected :– Gnostics– Liber Schale Machometi (= “Halmahereig”, translated by Abraham Alfaquim)– question of “Ascended Masters”and inherent Traditions,starting from – the ancient Pharaohs,For example:>Amenhotep III is believed to have begun his rule at about the age of nine.

Partly based on their scholarship, Guénon in 1925 published The Esoterism of Dante. From the theses of Rosetti and Aroux, Guénon retains only those elements that prove the existence of such hidden meanings; but he also makes clear that esoterism is not ‘heresy’ and that a doctrine reserved for an elite can be superimposed on the teaching given the faithful without standing in opposition to it. …— —- —However I think it is a little disconcerting that, in the city of the shroud and the famous Eucharistic Miracle (1453), we have to be reduced to humiliate our pridegoing to the house of the Muslims …>The event which led to the construction of the church occurred on 6 June 1453 during the war between Louis of Savoy and France.

For each sample, different measurements of the same crystalline phases (phengite and biotite) were performed in order to get averaged information of the chemical composition and to detect possible piezonuclear transmutations from iron to lighter elements. The results of EDS analyses show that, in the fracture surface samples, a considerable reduction in the iron content (~25%) seems to be counterbalanced by an increase in Al, Si, and Mg concentrations.Reading what is able to do EDS we can turn perplexedabout what really happened in the experiments by Carpinteri :>Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, EDX, or XEDS), sometimes called energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) or energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDXMA), is an analytical technique used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample. It relies on an interaction of some source of X-ray excitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are due in large part to the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure allowing unique set of peaks on its X-ray emission spectrum. …Link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy— —So…What happened?

As evoked by the Greek root of the word, they are caused by pressure waves, in both liquids and solids. The salient results, which have already appeared in authoritative international journals of experimental physics or mechanics, provide direct and indirect evidence of the occurrence of piezonuclear reactions. Indirect evidence includes the neutron emissions that have been detected in a regular and reproducible fashion using different types of detector. Direct evidence of piezonuclear reactions was obtained through a brand-new spectroscopic technique,EDS, which, by comparing a statistically significant number of spots lying on the outer surface or the fracture faces of the granite specimen, and aiming directly on the only two iron ores present – Phengite and Biotite – was able to ascertain that iron, on average, was locally reduced by 25% and was replaced with atoms of aluminium (atomic number =13, half that of iron), silicon (atomic number =14) and magnesium (atomic number =12). Thus, the split was symmetrical in the case of aluminium, asymmetrical in the other instances.If these reactions can take place in a laboratory, where pressure and temperature conditions are much lower and, especially, the masses at play are much smaller than those found in the deep layers of the earth’s crust, they are bound to take place on a much larger scale within the latter, triggered by fracturing and crushing phenomena of seismic and tectonic origin.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a promising technique for the detection of these materials, yet concerns over the sensitivity of SERS spectra of dyes to chemical and instrumental variables (such as pH, choice of SERS substrates and/or aggregants, and excitation wavelength) have prevented its widespread use in analytical applications. Over the last few years, the development of several microanalytical approaches has considerably increased the chances of success in the identification of minute amounts of dyes by SERS. However, the need for searchable databases is still largely to be fulfilled. In this work, we have assembled the core of a comprehensive library which contains 100 Raman and SERS reference spectra of natural and synthetic organic colorants. Experiments to classify 20 query SERS spectra of dyes from a variety of museum objects were conducted using principal component analysis (PCA) and the correlation coefficient (CC) algorithm. … etc. … etc. …Anal.

As I first asked on this blog [message dated September 8, 2015] we can read a comment connected to the interesting (and, perhaps, controversial…) book by William Meacham …Here what I wrote [September 8, 2015]:>Anyway, we can also try to consider what Prof. William Meacham wrote in the book: “The Rape of the Turin Shroud:How Christianity’s most precious relic was wrongly condemned, and violated” (= That book describes the two major fiascos to have afflicted the Turin Shroud in recent years: the C-14 dating of 1988 and the so-called “restoration” of 2002…)…We can remember that previously unpublished photographs of the Shroud, taken by STURP using Quad-Mosaic Photography (state-of-the-art NASA technology) at the time, were published in the scientific journal “Chemistry Today” by Marino and Benford in 2008 in a paper entitled “Discrepancies in the Radiocarbon Dating Area of the Turin Shroud”andthe fact that these “unpublished photographs of the Shroud” showed “anomalies in the radiocarbon sample area”…(see, for example, the paper by Mark Oxley under the address: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf and the paper by Barrie Schwortz: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf.).But the issue turned as another controversial proof…Then I think we have to solve an interesting “Four-corner and center (of the Shroud) [UV Photographs]” problem!Well.  How to exit from that conundrum?Now I ask:1- Is it possible to photograph the sample from the so-called “reserve” using ultraviolet fluorescence photography?2- Is it possible to photograph (another time) the Shroud using ultraviolet fluorescence photography?3- Is it possible  to photograph the Shroud sample of Arizona using ultraviolet fluorescence photography?Is too difficult to obtain the permission to do all these simple works?In that case we still can think to start trying the checks after a positive answer only to the questions number 1 and 3… (and also this work it’s obviously feasible only with inherent permissions).But (probably) we still require another check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud (as main reference) because the controls, without the adequate reference (= the check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud), seems to be a bit inconclusive … or …Would we retain the old UV data (from the main body of the Shroud) as useful reference?In any case if Prof. Jull (of the University of Arizona) want be gentle with us and provide us the useful UV photograph for Arizona sample, that fact will be an interesting “great progress”.But this is not a great progress.So…I think we can try to reflect how to write a Plan to submit to the attention of Prof. Jull.Another thing:  don’t like mass spectrometry and I prefer non destructive analyses…Is that preliminar work on that Arizona sample too difficult? Only “SPMs-utopia”?— — —… And, at the end, I want to remember that there exist Alternative Methods for Dating the Shroud… that(probably) can break all the vain claims.","date":"September 10, 2015 at 9:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/09/significant-response-to-the-preview-of-the-thermochimica-acta-editorial/","cat":"article","title":"Significant Response to the Preview of the Thermochimica Acta Editorial"},{"author":"piero","post":"Colin,Thanks for the link:http://www.andertoons.com/easter/cartoon/6573/put-them-in-one-basket-on-purpose-like-to-live-dangerously— —You wrote:“It’s unwise to invest all one’s hopes and dreams into any one single approach that if as yet untried and untested may not deliver the desired answer”Yes.But …As you have seen AFM was not the unique technique involved…","date":"February 13, 2015 at 11:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’"},{"author":"piero","post":"I have just read the following strange words:>… two crude pamphlets produced in 1992 – 1993 by one Carlos Evaristo, an obscure young man from Portugal who claims to have interviewed Sister Lucy on two different occasions in her cloistered convent.>According to Evaristo, during these two “interviews” Sister Lucy essentially retracted everything she had said about the Message of Fatima during the previous 75 years. …>… …Evaristo has published the interviews in the form of two pamphlets, entitled Two Hours with Sister Lucy and It All Started with Two Hours with Sister Lucy.

They have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose chains of a crystalline substrate because of their two-domain structure, i.e. cellulose-binding domain and catalytic domain, and unique active site architecture…Cellobiohydrolases (CBH’s), attack cellulose from the non-reducing ends of the cellulose polymers and yield cellobiose (a glucose dimer) as a majorproduct. Two types of CBH enzymes are known: cellobiohydrolase-l (CBHI) which generates cellobiose exclusively, and cellobiohydrolase-ll ~CBHII) which generates a mixture of cellobiose and glucose. CBH enzymes have not been found in cellulolytic, non-filamentous bacteria, and thus appear to be limited to fungal and filamentous bacterial sources.— —Third question: I never try to polemizar with Jamon on what has instead written Agnoli …because I’ve already enough pockets full of false coins with whatI jump out with the bad Google translations … — — —In any case I have found the following paper:Complexity of Spoken Versus Written Language for Machine Translation Nick RuizConference: European Association of Machine Translation, At Dubrovnik, Croatia Abstract>When machine translation researchers participate in evaluation tasks,they typically design their primary submissions using ideas that are not genre-specific.In fact, their systems look much the same from one evaluation campaign to another.

The research includes three new tests, two chemical ones and one mechanical one. The first two were carried out with an FT-IR system, so using infra-red light, and the other using Raman spectroscopy. The third was a multi-parametric mechanical test based on five different mechanical parameters linked to the voltage of the wire. The machine used to examine the Shroud’s fibres and test traction, allowed researchers to examine tiny fibres alongside about twenty samples of cloth dated between 3000 BC and 2000 AD.The new tests carried out in the University of Padua labs were carried out by a number of university professors from various Italian universities and agree that the Shroud dates back to the period when Jesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem. Final results show that the Shroud fibres examined produced the following dates, all of which are 95% certain and centuries away from the medieval dating obtained with Carbon-14 testing in 1988: the dates given to the Shroud after FT-IR testing, is 300 BC ±400, 200 BC ±500 after Raman testing and 400 AD ±400 after multi-parametric mechanical testing. The average of all three dates is 33 BC  ±250 years. The book’s authors observed that the uncertainty of this date is less than the single uncertainties and the date is compatible with the historic date of Jesus’ death on the cross, which historians claim occurred in 30 AD.The tests were carried out using tiny fibres of material extracted from the Shroud by micro-analyst Giovanni Riggi di Numana who passed away in 2008 but had participated in the1988 research project and gave the material to Fanti through the cultural institute Fondazione 3M.Source : http://frbkirk.wordpress.com/","date":"March 27, 2013 at 10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/26/new-italian-book-the-mystery-of-the-shroud-by-giulio-fanti-and-saverio-gaeta/","cat":"books","title":"New Italian Book: The Mystery of the Shroud by Giulio Fanti and Saverio Gaeta"},{"author":"piero","post":"I indicated the DHM (= Digital Holography Microscope) in order to investigatethe pollen.

The IMS was designed and built by the authors and the DMA instrument was produced by TA Instrument Co (USA). Because different methods are applied for determination of the dynamic Young’s modulus it was necessary to perform a comparison analysis of the results received from the IMS and DMA, which are currently the most frequently used testers. This analysis shows that an IMS can be used when a DMA cannot be applied. The parameter set comprising the dynamic Young’s modulus for longitudinal vibrations can find application in material engineering in industry. The DMA method does not require the application of mathematical formulas to determine Young’s modulus but requires calibration as apposed to IMS. Measurements of the elasticity modulus were carried out under automatically stabilised climatic conditions. The compliance of the results obtained allows us to evaluate positively the performance of the Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer. Comparison of the results makes it possible to determine the measuring possibilities of the DMA and IMS and show the advantages of IMS over DMA. — —What is your opinion ?Probably we can work (with a particular device)using a single linen fibril …— —Do you know Structural Mechanics ?There is the three-point bending test with an AFM apparel that is an interesting way to use.In my opinion this is the way to know the answerfrom the linen fibrils.— —I hope in your reply …","date":"March 26, 2013 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/26/new-italian-book-the-mystery-of-the-shroud-by-giulio-fanti-and-saverio-gaeta/","cat":"books","title":"New Italian Book: The Mystery of the Shroud by Giulio Fanti and Saverio Gaeta"},{"author":"piero","post":"I have a doubt about the possible transformation(during the Resurrection) of the water trappedinto the cellulosic chains …  !!!Sorry…I hope to read (once more) something on that book.","date":"December 13, 2013 at 1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/please-only-discuss-michael-judes-book-and-claims-here/","cat":"books","title":"Please Only Discuss Michael Jude’s Book and Claims Here"},{"author":"piero","post":"Personally I have found very interesting the solution againstthe old carbon dating for the Shroud (the results of 1988,coming from  the 14C test) = the numismatic dating of the Shroud!No one had ever written in such detail on the question ofprobability calculus based on careful observations ofByzantine coins, etc. and then I think this is certainlya great merit of Professor Giulio Fanti …So, our friend Charles Freeman has to work in order to showwhere is the error … because this numismatic dating is alsoagainst the strange ideas shown by Charles Freeman.I have also found a bit strange that Dr. John Jackson (…or Dr. Whanger …)has never published something of strictly similar aboutthe interesting numismatic dating of the Shroud.Attention, please: here I was not talking about the controversialissue of the alleged coins on the eyes of the Man of the Shroud,instead I was talking of facial features found in Byzantine coinsand inherent numismatic dating (for the Shroud of Turin)…","date":"July 1, 2015 at 11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/01/quoting-john-jackson-chapter-21-verses-24-and-25/","cat":"books","title":"Quoting John Jackson Chapter 21 Verses 24 and 25"},{"author":"piero","post":"Bleaching with sodium hypochlorite The high reactivity of this bleaching agent imposes softer operative conditions than hydrogen peroxide (pH 9 – 11 and temperatures not above 30 ºC).

The introduction of the confocal design in most Raman spectrometers represents the latest advance in the field of instruments for Raman spectroscopy. It is the basis of new applications in the field of Raman microprobing and improvements in Raman imaging techniques. The basic principle of confocal microscopy is reviewed and its extension to Raman spectroscopy is discussed in terms of improved depth resolution which results in better background discrimination. A new concept of Raman imaging is also presented which benefits from the confocal system and overcomes most of the limitations of direct imaging techniques. A dual fibre-optic remote analysis scheme is described which has been developed to optimize the collection of the scattered light while minimizing the interference from the optical fibres. .— — — *** — —B.T.W. :Do you know the Polarized Raman Microspectroscopy?","date":"August 25, 2014 at 10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"author":"piero","post":"Try to consider:Raman-AFM and nano-Raman (TERS)…See under the address:http://www.horiba.com/us/en/scientific/products/raman-spectroscopy/raman-afm-and-nano-raman/configuration/Configurations for Raman-AFM and TERS imaging …","date":"August 26, 2014 at 5:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"author":"piero","post":"I want to clarify:Obviously ATR-FTIR is not a scanning probe microscopy…— —If you want to improve the knowledges there is the following link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrational_analysis_with_scanning_probe_microscopy>… …In 2007, AFM was combined with infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) spectroscopy to study the dissolution process of urea in a cyclohexane/butanol solution with a high spatial resolution. and there is the following way:> AFM/FTIR setup>Spatial resolution>The spatial resolution of an AFM/FTIR instrument is related to the contact area between the probe and sampleBut, typically, an AFM/FTIR has a resolution of “only” 50–400 nm, for example, 100 nm…","date":"March 3, 2015 at 8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/nine-selected-and-revised-papers-from-the-bari-conference/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Nine Selected and Revised Papers from the Bari Conference"},{"author":"piero","post":"All very interesting.But no one has used advanced microscopy,scanning probe microscopies (SPMs) …(apart the “Opto-chemical analysis” with ATR-FTIR, then see the paper by Fanti:“Optical features of flax fibers coming from the Turin Shroud”,  link:http://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2015/02/shsconf_atsi2014_00004.pdf )PLM (Polarized Light Microscopy) and IR Raman analysis (see the same paper by prof.

DOI: 10.1364/OL.39.004800 Here an excerpt from the Abstract:>We have developed a new easy-to-use probe that can be used to combine atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). We show that, using this device, the evanescent field, obtained by total internal reflection conditions in a prism, can be visualized by approaching the surface with the scanning tip. Fur-thermore, we were able to obtain simultaneous AFM and SNOM images of a standard test grating in air and in liquid.>The lateral resolution in AFM and SNOM mode was estimated to be 45 and 160 nm, respectively.>This new probe overcomes a number of limitations that commercial probes have, while yielding the same resolution. © 2014 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (060.2310) Fiber optics; (180.4243) Near-field microscopy; (180.5810) Scanning microscopy; (060.2370) Fiber optics sensors. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) instruments are widely recognized as valuable tools for characterizing physical, chemical, electrical, electrochemical, and optical properties of materials at the nanometer scale.>Atomic force microscopy (AFM), for example, is routinely used to map the surface topography with a resolu-tion well beyond the optical limit, both in gaseous and liquid environments>By replacing the standard AFM cantilever with a tipped glass fiber, one can then equip the instrument with scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) capabilities. The latter can provide information on the optical field emerging from the sur-face of the sample with a lateral resolution of a few tens of nanometers.>The combination of AFM and SNOM has found applications in many fields, including cell biology and single molecule experiments.>Unfortunately, current AFM – SNOM probes come with some limitations. In the most widely used setups, the scanning fiber is glued to one of the two prongs of a piezoelectric tuning fork that cannot be immersed in conductive liquids>To obtain an image of a solid sur-face in a liquid environment, one thus needs to ensure the tuning fork is kept out of the immersion bath> In this configuration, the meniscus of the liquid on the fiber may influence the performance of the probe. Furthermore, tuning forks cannot be used in contact with the sample, hampering any possibility to perform contact mode scan-ning. This restriction can be overcome by replacing the probe with a tipped fiber bent in the form of a cantilever.>The position of the cantilever can then be monitored via an optical triangulation readout>Alternatively, a standard silicon AFM cantilever can be modified for near-field imaging by making a small hole at the tip apex>These configurations also facilitate experiments in liquids, but add the nuisance of the alignment procedure of the readout, which becomes even more tedious when the probe is immersed in a fluid.>In an earlier attempt to solve these technical issues, in 2001, Minh et al. presented a probe that could detect the SNOM signal via a hollow micromachined cantilever glued on top of an optical fiber>In 2011, we proposed to skip the gluing step by directly carving the cantilever out of the cleaved end of the fiber, which also adds the possibility to measure the cantilever deflection using fiber interferometry. In that experiment we showed that fiber-top probes can collect the SNOM signal throughout an entire AFM indentation stroke.>In 2006, that approach, today known as fiber-top technology, had already been used successfully for AFM imaging.>However, the manufacturing procedure of both Ming’s and our fiber-coupled cantilevers is still rather complex.>In this Letter, we propose to approach this problem via a new probe based on ferrule-top technology. … … …","date":"March 3, 2015 at 8:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/nine-selected-and-revised-papers-from-the-bari-conference/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Nine Selected and Revised Papers from the Bari Conference"},{"author":"piero","post":"High Energy ChemistryJuly 2003, Volume 37, Issue 4, pp 209-215 On the Crosslinking of Cellulose under Exposure to RadiationG.

Harnack defended this position in his most popular book, Das Wesen des Christentums (1900; What Is Christianity?), which was the transcript of a course of lectures he had delivered at the University of Berlin.>Harnack’s other major works are Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur bis Eusebius (1893–1904; The History of Ancient Christian Literature) and Die Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten (1902; The Mission and Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries). He was the chief editor of a critical edition of The Greek-Christian Authors of the First Three Centuries (1891– ).>He also published numerous monographs on the New Testament and on the doctrines and institutions of the ancient church.>In all these works, Harnack tried to show how the Gospel of Jesus, which in his view has nothing in common with authoritarian ecclesiastical statutes and doctrines, became embodied in the doctrines of the church. He also expressed the conviction that, if Christianity is to retain its power in the modern world, it must be freed from any connection with the dogmas of God and Christ with which it became identified to survive in the Hellenistic world. …Link:http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255617/Adolf-von-HarnackInstead regarding SchnackenburgI have found an italian article by Nobile Marco,“Recensione: Rudolf Schnackenburg, La persona di Gesù Cristo nei quattro vangeli”, published in Antonianum, 71/2 (1996) p. 357 .Link: http://www.antonianum.eu/2/rivista_bibliografiaViewnota.php?id=2070Here an excerpt (rough translation):>This monograph on the person of Jesus is neither a research on the historical Jesus, how he wanted the Leben-Jesuforschung of some decades ago, neither wants to take up the question about the relationship between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith of the primitive community Kerygmatic .

When searching for the historical identity of Jesus Christ, you have access to only the gospels. Now, these are undoubtedly the projection of a truly historical entity and identity, however incontrovertible that basis is available only in the mediation offered by the long and complex tradition of primitive communities and, ultimately, its crystallization editorial work of the evangelists. When, then, we want to answer the question “Who was Jesus Christ?”, We as the only source of the four gospels, which make theologically significant historical event that occurred two thousand years ago with the appearance of the Rabbi of Nazareth, who, no reaction hermeneutics of the early church, it would be a historical phenomenon among others.

The dynamic response of the tip includes the complex tip–surface interactions due to the surface properties. We found that conventional tapping mode had a limitation in the accurate set-point control on soft and high adhesion surfaces. This study employed the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based AFM microcantilever characterization method to estimate the surface property with more reliable control.

Peggie,    Sergei G. KazarianAbstract:>The potential of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) imaging for the characterisation of the chemical components of paint cross sections from old master paintings was investigated. Three cross sections were chosen to cover a variety of the analytical problems encountered in samples from paintings. The binding medium and degradation products in a green paint sample from a fifteenth-century Florentine painting were imaged, as well as a thin layer within a cross-section from a fifteenth-century German painting, and multiple thin surface coatings on a painting of the 1760s by Peter Romney. The application of chemometric methods for further analysis of the large data set generated for each sample was also explored. The study demonstrated the advantages of ATR-FTIR imaging, which allowed images to be obtained with high spatial resolution (ca. 3–4 μm) without the need to microtome the sample. The gain in sensitivity in detecting trace materials and the information derived from the location of these compounds in the sample was especially valuable, improving interpretation of the FTIR analysis and extending knowledge of the sample composition beyond that obtainable with other analytical techniques.Link:http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-008-2092-y— — —Here another study (not on linen, but about the paper!):Ancient and modern paper characterization by FTIR and Micro-Raman spectroscopyVito Librando, Zelica Minniti, Salvatore LorussoConservation Science in Cultural Heritage(Quaderni di Scienza della Conservazione) Link:http://conservation-science.unibo.it/article/view/2700http://link.springer— — —Here the other way:“AFM CFM chemometric methods”= CFM consists of measuring the interaction forces between a modified “functionalized” tip and a surface by using atomic force microscopy (AFM).— —>CFM has been primarily developed by Charles Lieber at Harvard University in 1994.Link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_force_microscopy— —>CFM measures the chemical interactions between functionalized tips and sample to determine the chemical nature of surfaces and facilitate studies of chemical bonding enthalpy and surface energy.

Normally, glyoxylate is converted to the amino acid glycine or to a compound called glycolate through the action of two enzymes, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, respectively. Mutations in the AGXT or GRHPR gene cause a shortage of these enzymes, which prevents the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine or glycolate. As levels of glyoxylate build up, it is converted to oxalate. Oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate deposits, which can damage the kidneys and other organs.Link:http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-hyperoxaluriaSo we should investigate the genetic issue.

While mouth feature points are identified using the redness property of regions, a simple search strategy relative to the position of the mouth is carried out to identify eye feature points from a set of regions. Priority is given to regions which signal high intensity variance, thereby allowing the most probable eye regions to be selected. On detecting a mouth and two eyes, a face verification step based on Eigenface theory is applied to a normalized search space in the image relative to the distance between the eye feature points.It’s useful the use of a facial feature extraction step prior to performingPCA analysis…— — —I have found another paper:“An application of caricature: How to improve the recognition of facial composites”Charlie Frowda, Vicki Bruceb, David Rossc, Alex McIntyrec & Peter J.

We investigate whether the recognition of facial composites, or pictures of criminal faces, could be similarly enhanced. In this study, participants first estimated the degree of caricature necessary to make composites most identifiable. Contrary to expectation, an anticaricature was found to be best, presumably as this tended to reduce the appearance of errors. In support of this explanation, more positive caricature estimates were assigned to morphed composites: representations that tend to contain less overall error. In addition, anticaricaturing reduced identification for morphed composites but enhanced identification for individual composites. Although such improvements were too small to be of value to law enforcement, a sizeable naming benefit was observed when presenting a range of caricature states, which appeared to capitalize on individual differences in the internal representation of familiar faces.— — —Here a question:Is the caricature a key to understand the strange Manoppello’s Veil?— — —Here (obviously) I have kept aside the controversial issue of the twoancient Roman coins (… that with the Sudarium of Oviedo have nothing to do !!!).","date":"February 12, 2015 at 8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"},{"author":"piero","post":"In principle I am opposed to datingwith the C14 because this is a destructive method.We should be careful in the analysis of the two relics.Here’s an example: what do we knowusing the method of C14 about the differences(if they really exist) between the bloodon the Shroud and that of the Sudarium of Oviedo?Link:http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=61556Here I wanted to link the words aboutbloodstains with the last interesting workbyAdrie A.
