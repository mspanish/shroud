Sunset beginning a Passover sabbath (John’s reference) or simply a sabbath (Mark et al) necessitated speeding up the deaths. Remember, crucifixion served more than as a means to execute a criminal. It was a form of torture and public humiliation. And it served as a graphic warning to others. As such, the longer it went on, the better.To hasten death that day, the soldiers “broke the legs” of the other two, but not of Jesus who was already dead. Roman law dictated that the heart be pierced to ensure the person was really dead and not just comatose.So if the soldiers were going around jabbing convicts in the heart, why not stab the other two as well? Because, IMO, broken legs would hasten death but not immediately cause it. Unable to lift themselves up by their feet to counter their body weight, asphyxiation would indeed result in one final display of cruelty.","date":"December 21, 2013 at 10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/20/christmas-card/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Christmas Card"}],"researchers":[{"author":"joe_veneroso","post":"Hi Dan!

Shameless Self-Promotion Alert!)”The Chimera”  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1483630196/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1380279381&sr=8-1&pi=AC_SX110_SY165 I guess by O’Reilly’s standards God told me to reply to your blog.Unlike aforementioned novel (in which the Shroud plays a crucial role) O’Reilly claims his book is factual. (Hell, it’s not even scriptural!)The gospels agree (a rarity to be sure) that the women went to the tomb PRECISELY to anoint the body, carrying with them the spices and myrrh. And if, according to some non-existent Jewish tradition of visiting the tomb “on the third day” which God must have vouched safe to O’Reilly alone, other problems arise. The gospel account of Lazarus in John’s gospel clearly states he had been in the tomb “four days” and the women protest Jesus’ request to role away the stone. But more germane, it is that very phrase “on the third day” that has caused fundamentalists and scripture scholars alike such àgita, nigh these 2,000 years.Calendar days from Friday to Sunday might allow the names of three days, but by Jewish counting from sunset, Jesus had been in the tomb barely a day and a half. Thirty six hours max.The women went to the tomb WITH SPICES because the onset of the Sabbath on Friday evening precluded them from preparing the body of Jesus for burial properly.  At sunrise Sunday they went, and the rest is history, although not apparently the one O’Reilly researched.","date":"September 27, 2013 at 7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/27/the-gospel-according-to-bill-oreilly/","cat":"books","title":"The Gospel According to Bill O’Reilly"}]}
