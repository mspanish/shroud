{"resources":[{"author":"angela","post":"thought tonights show interesting especially the part you indicate the shroud plays in the resurrection of Jesus at the very moment he goes from ‘death’ to ‘life’.  My problem is the fact that (1) a Christian “walk(s) by faith not by sight” and (2) the scriptures are clear in a number of translation Jesus was resurrected “in the spirit” and not ‘in the flesh’ making the material body unimportant in his resurrection.  This is born out by the fact he would look differently to those people who saw him ie Mary thought he was a gardener the ’emanus’ incident where he was not recognized until he broke ‘bread’ add the fact he ‘vanished’ right then & there…when he ‘appeared’ in the upper room it was through locked doors (no material body could do this) time/space not withstanding!  The body was NOT in the tomb but the linen cloths (scriptures indicates ‘cloths’ pluarl were..yet everytime Jesus appears he is fully clothed!Your program slipped over these evidences that Jesus appeared in materialized bodies in order to prove he had been resurrected from the dead.  How else would he prove that having been resurrected ‘ in the spirit’ which cannot be seen by human eyes?","date":"April 21, 2011 at 2:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/20/what-really-happened-during-lost-40-days/","cat":"books","title":"What really happened during ‘Lost 40 Days’?"}]}
