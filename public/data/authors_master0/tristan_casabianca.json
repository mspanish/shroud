Both the large ‘linen cloth’ impinging on the symbols of the Evangelists in the lower corners and disrupting the balance of the composition, and the second border, seem to indicate that the figure of Christ was not part of the initial design.The iconographic theme is the symbolic representation of the sacrificial Lamb, surrounded by angelic hosts and the symbols of the Evangelists. The symmetrical composition, with the horizontal shroud (in some examples the sepulchre), the two angel-deacons with their liturgical fans venerating behind, the symbols of the Evangelists in the corners, and the ornamental motifs on the ground and the inner border recur in a series of fourteenth-century epitaphioi studied by Millet. A variation of the spiral motif decorating the arcs in the corners appears on the collar of a sakkos in the Vatican (14th c.) and on the epigonation of Metropolitan Anthimos in the Tismana Monastery (1370): these comparanda may indicate the approximate date of the earlier epitaphios. For the later work, comparisons may be made with the epitaphios of Metropolitan Makarios of Moldavia-Wallachia (1428) and those in the Meteora Monastery and in the Church of St Nicholas Radaut (today the Museum of Sucevita), although an even more recent ‘renovation’ based on older models cannot be excluded.”","date":"June 28, 2014 at 9:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/28/comment-promoted-the-stavronikita-epitaphios/","cat":"art","title":"Comment Promoted:  The Stavronikita Epitaphios"},{"author":"tristan_casabianca","post":"Dan, A letter to the editor has  published in Injury in response to Bevilacqua’s paper.

So, any deductions made about the shoulders are based upon the angle formed by the upper edge of the trapezius muscle as compared to the contralateral side. In addition, it does not deﬁne the exact placement of the humeral head centre. The authors proposed an alternative interpretation of an anterior dislocation that could be consistent with an indirect mechanism of dislocation (as provoked by a fall during which the right hand came into contact with the ﬂoor). It could be argued that the movements, traction needed, and position in cruciﬁxion could reduce the dislocation if it was present.

If you’ve ever seen pre-Renaissance paintings, the figures almost look like flat cartoon figures without any perspective, whereas the man on the shroud is anatomically accurate. It’s quite a striking image. So some scholars who’ve been working on this whole shroud thing believe the carbon-14 test may have been skewed in some way because the shroud was damaged by fire around the 1500s. When the nuns repaired the shroud, they may have interwoven cloth into the fabric of the shroud in order to repair tears, patches or rips. It may be where they took the piece, a centimeter square piece of the hem of the shroud, some would suggest, that this may have been part of the repair work on the edge rather than the original fabric. So they want to rerun the test, but the Catholic Church doesn’t permit it because when you carbon date these things it destroys the sample, and so for them it’s destroying this precious relic. It’s sacred so they don’t want people doing it. The Church hasn’t agreed to letting it be done again, but until those carbon dating tests are reversed, I think one can’t say that the shroud is authentic. You would need to have those tests somehow shown to be erroneous. Apart from those tests, the signs of authenticity on the shroud are quite remarkable.”http://www.reasonablefaith.org/forum-on-the-resurrection-with-william-lane-craig#ixzz33GojwL9i","date":"May 31, 2014 at 2:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/30/bradley-bowen-craig-knows-better-than-to-put-the-shroud-of-turin-forward-as-historical-evidence/","cat":"books","title":"Bradley Bowen: Craig knows better than to put the Shroud of Turin forward as historical evidence"},{"author":"tristan_casabianca","post":"I really don’t know if there are writings on the shroud.

For sure, it is the most popular, the most discussed, but not the most important.From my article published last year in the Heythrop Journal (“The Shroud of Turin: A Historiographical Approach”):“Historical criteria do not fall from the sky; they are part of a slowly-built-up methodology routinely used by historians, whatever may be their opinion on the subject being discussed. This article will use criteria specified by Christopher Behan McCullagh. One can list these in order of priority from the most important to the least; this list, while not written in stone, provides a general idea of the most important conditions to satisfy. Thus one has: 1) plausibility: does our knowledge in other well-known fields support or reinforce the hypothesis? 2) Explanatory scope: can the hypothesis do justice to all the facts? 3) Explanatory power: the hypothesis has to be specific and accurate, rather than ambiguous. 4) Less ad hoc: ceteris paribus, the hypothesis should not invoke or rely on unverified data (this includes the criterion of simplicity). 5) Illumination: does the hypothesis shed light on other widely accepted phenomena? This last criterion was added by Licona who believes it contributes further specification.”","date":"November 16, 2014 at 6:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/16/maybe-friar-ockham-was-wrong/","cat":"books","title":"Maybe Friar Ockham was wrong"}]}
