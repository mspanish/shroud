Why is it so difficult to think of the Lord with an updated haircut, lol, Heaven is the most updated place in this world. Why do we keep Jesus’ image way back to 2000 years ago. Makes me smile that we think Heaven is an old place, to me HEAVEN  will be the most amazing updated place to be one day, for those who believe in the Lord Jesus, the Son of God.. hey smile God loves you!!!","date":"November 2, 2011 at 8:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/24/more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
