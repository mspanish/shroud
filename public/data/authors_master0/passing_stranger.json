Wow.Look we understand that some people *need* the shroud to be real to shore up their weak faith but that doesn’t actually *make* it real. The evidence for the shroud being a medieval fake is far too strong and homogeneous to be doubted by a few scraps of dubious pseudo-science.And why continue the debate here? Why not come over to the JREF and deal with the science?well actually we know why, the need to control the debate.","date":"September 23, 2012 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/27/savage-treatment-in-randi-land/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Savage Treatment in Randi Land"},{"author":"passing_stranger","post":"Sigh.
