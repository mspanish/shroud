{"researchers":[{"author":"uriel","post":"Hello, Louis. I am amazed that apparently 99% of shroud skeptics completely ignore the Jospice Mattress Imprint. I know that Hugh Farey knows about it, but the other skeptics don’t even bother. Since it is the only other documented (photographed) case that can be compared to the Shroud of Turin, one can assume that the majority of skeptical theories can be thrown out the window. The only other skeptic that can probably have a say on the Jospice Mattress Imprint is Colin Berry since he is a scientist, and I remember that Piero asked him about it, but Berry said that the subject didn’t interest him. That he would rather “stick to the details that interest him”. However, he did say that he was open to new ideas, so We can hope that at some point in the future, Colin Berry can join in the conversation on it. The other skeptics can only give out their amateur opinion if they ever have interest in it. Do you know if any member of the STURP team, apart from Barrie Schwortz, knows/knew about it? Do you also know if there are other possibilities apart from the bilirubin hypothesis professed by Dr. Fred Zugibe or in your case, telergy?","date":"December 10, 2014 at 1:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/10/remembering-ray-rogers-at-the-st-louis-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Remembering Ray Rogers at the St. Louis Conference"},{"author":"uriel","post":"Thank You Very Much for the information, Louis. These subjects are quite fascinating to me, and it is great to know from an expert who has studied them in depth. Keep up the great research!","date":"December 10, 2014 at 3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/10/remembering-ray-rogers-at-the-st-louis-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Remembering Ray Rogers at the St. Louis Conference"}]}
