{"art":[{"author":"mimi","post":"Trish Payne, Please read 90 minutes in heaven by Todd Burpo, about 12 years before his account of heaven I lost my father who I loved dearly, I was angry & upset, then one night I had a vision of my father, he said to me ” I am in a really beautiful place, & am so happy here so don’t worry about me” behind him was the most beautiful place I have ever seen! the colors were so vivid and EVERYTHING was singing! The birds, the flowers and even the running brook my father was seated next to on a huge grey rock. In 2010 I read 90 Minutes in Heaven & was floored as Mr Burpo described the same place I saw my father at after he died! I am a living breathing testimony that God, Heaven & Jesus are REAL, I feel humbled and HONORED that Jesus & God allowed me to glimpse Heaven through my  earthly father, please know this we will be reunited,  knowing this allowed me to bear the loss of a dear young man who had become like my own child  when he met & fell in love with our youngest daughter. Adam Schicht was 33 when he died suddenly in 2009, I know he will be with the first ones to greet me when I pass to the other side, & I better have eggnog,a running joke with Adam & myself.  We are but a heart beat away from the loved ones who await us on the other side, God Bless you!","date":"July 26, 2012 at 5:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"mimi","post":"trish payne :I lost my dad suddenly on dec. 22 2011 barely 4 weeks ago, i have been struggling with the loss so much , someone suggested this book “heaven is for real” i went yesterday and bought it, after finishing it tonight i feel so much better about my dads death and when i looked at the prince of peace picture i was captivated and a calmness over took me, yes i do believe the story colton has shared heaven is for real and i will again see my dad and grandparents as well!!!","date":"July 26, 2012 at 5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
