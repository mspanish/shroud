We have no such assurance about Fanti’s methodsHowever, if it is a fringe theory (and it may be — I’m not an expert in the field) the scientific community may be rightly reluctant to spend a lot of time and effort trying to validate what may be a dubious procedure.","date":"March 29, 2013 at 10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/27/giulio-fanti-the-image-of-a-man-who-lived-between-280-bc-and-220-ad/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Giulio Fanti: The Image of a Man Who Lived Between 280 BC and 220 AD"}]}
