I pray that people will continue to inspire by all these wonderful messages most especially to Akiane and Colton for their inspiring story and to their family too for bringing out both the picture and the experience about Heaven, Jesus they’ve heard from their child. In many way you’ve already safed many souls and change the life of the others. I’ve read the story entitled “Heaven is for Real” it was a quite story that gives me hope and encourage my life at the same time as a Seminarian. I am very devoted Roman Catholicism. I will continue to pray for your family that will continue ot live with many blessings and continue to spread the Gospel throughout the whole World. Jesus will never leaves us as it said in Hebrew 13:8 “Jesus is today, tomorrow and forever”.God bless you and the commenters.","date":"March 18, 2012 at 2:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
