I am extremely interested in the shroud and have been following the research for a number of yours.  I most definitely believe that it is the burial cloth of Christ (though a nonbeliever) and that the image was formed by some inexplicable event.  I accept that it might have been a side effect of the Resurrection—why not?–but I WOULD very much like to know how the image was formed in physics terms, however it was implemented.  I appreciate these articles and these comments as shedding more light on the developing evidence.  I just finished reading Wilson’s last book, where he updated the history.  I see a reference at this site  to Dreisbach.  Was it he or someone else who found references to the shroud in the Acts of Thomas?  This would appear to be extremely valuable historical evidence, even if it does not date to the first century, yet I seem to find little written about it. Wilson did not mention it.","date":"June 4, 2012 at 9:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/04/yannicks-nice-surprise-folding-test-on-the-enrie/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick’s Nice Surprise:  Folding Test on the Enrie"}]}
