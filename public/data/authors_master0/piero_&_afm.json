{"opinion":[{"author":"piero_&_afm","post":"First of all : the exact italian name is Linoli (Odoardo) and not Lonoli …My interest is in the textile field and my old idea (1998) to control the linen fibrilsusing the advanced the SPMs (= Scanning Probe Microscopies… and working,for example :  with the three-point bending tests and also with the controls aboutthe cellulosic DP) can also be useful in the biological domain … because wecan study the relics in a better manner with all the adequate tools forSPM investigations (= Applied Structural Mechanics and Applied Nanotechnology).Under the address :http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/mir/lanciano.htmlwe can read the following words :>In 1970-’71 and taken up again partly in 1981 there took place a scientific investigation by the most illustrious scientist Prof. Odoardo Linoli, eminent Professor in Anatomy and Pathological Histology and in Chemistry and Clinical Microscopy. He was assisted by Prof. Ruggero Bertelli of the University of Siena.>The analyses were conducted with absolute and unquestionable scientific precision and they were documented with a series of microscopic photographs.instead under :http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/physician-tells-of-eucharistic-miracle-of-lancianowe can read :>Linoli extracted parts of the relics with great care and then analyzed the remains of “miraculous flesh and blood.” He presented his findings on March 4, 1971.>His study confirmed that the flesh and blood were of human origin. The flesh was unequivocally cardiac tissue, and the blood was of type AB.>Consulted by ZENIT, Linoli explained that “as regards the flesh, I had in my hand the endocardium. Therefore, there is no doubt at all that it is cardiac tissue.”>In regard to the blood, the scientist emphasized that “the blood group is the same as that of the man of the holy Shroud of TurinIn any case the possible key to solve the enigma of Lanciano (apart the Faith)is the DNA analysis. But I remember that an ancient DNA can be very difficult to control …So … How to see the scientific truth ?In the past (in Civitavecchia, Italy) the statue of Mary was weeping tears of blood.Perhaps this happened because Jesus is her only Son and She wants us to follow him.But (clearly) this is not a scientific explanation and we don’t know what is the scientific answer from the new intruments.— — —Sorry.  I am not an expert in the field of coagulation/fibrinolysis of normal blood and pathological blood. I am only curious to know where are located the Labs interested in these particular experiments.— —I have found a vague bibliographic reference :S. Thalhammer, W.M. Heckl (2004) : Atomic Force Microscopy as a tool in nanobiologyBut I don’t agree with idea to do the nano-destructions.See for example the previous work :R. Stark, S. Thalhammer, J. Wienberg, W.M.
