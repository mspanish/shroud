{"art":[{"author":"carol_hawks","post":"I did not have a nde myself but met some others that have.  I was a Registered respiratory therapist at a major hospital.  We had a man brought in the E.R. in cardiac arrest.  I worked on him by pumping air into his airways using an “ambu” bag.  We were successful and he was sent up to the coronary care unit. A few days later, I was heading to the elevator and I saw a man sitting by the window.  When I got closer he said “I know you, when they were working on  me I  looked down and saw you working at my head on me.”  He told me he was floating above his body and could see us resuscitating him.  This was so interesting to me.  It made me feel so good that he had survived.  Another man said he could see his father reaching to him through flames.  I told him “You have been  given a second chance.  You can see where you are headed so you have a chance to turn your life around and ask Gods forgiveness and work to go to heaven instead.","date":"April 18, 2012 at 1:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
