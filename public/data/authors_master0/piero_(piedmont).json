{"dating":[{"author":"piero_(piedmont)","post":"Dear Colin,In the case of cellulosic materials (=Cotton, linen, paper, etc.)the measurement of the cellulosic DP is an interesting way to knowthe true epoch for that ancient linen sheet and this method(the detection of the cellulosic degree of polym. for the cellulosic chains)is very interesting … and that … not only in my opinion !See, for example the previous studies by Diana and Marinelli.In 1997 during the Symposium of the CIELT (in Nice, France) and alsopreviously they indicated that way …Unfortunately they indicated a wrong system (using the presumed properapparel) for the right analyses about the Holy Shroud :the viscometric measurement.This way requires a lot of material with respect the very little amountof linen fibrils (… obviously here … I speak in a rough manner. Thus : takingapart the problems connected with the Applied Statistics … and the calculationsinherent the exact amount of material required to obtain a decent andincontrovertible work with the fibrils) in the case of the AFM measurements !Another problem is due to the effect of the past fungal attacks.Then the inherent areas involved in these degradation are to avoidduring the controls (of the cellulosic DP).And now (= after this simple attempt to explain the scientific question) :What is your idea ?— —You can try to improve your knowledges about the degradation of thecellulose (and the cellulosic DP) and the degradation evolution equationof cellulose, reading the following paper :Author response to the comments by P. Calvini regarding the article “On the degradation evolution equations of cellulose” by H.-Z. Ding and Z. D. WangSource :the reviewCellulose,April 2008, Volume 15, Issue 2, pp 229-237Springer— —I guess that in your reply you point another timethe attention about the (presumed) unsolved problemof the absolute scale of dating …But we can try to obtain the useful scale measuring the ancient and oldcellulosic materials.See for example the recent dating for the portrait of Bianca Sforza(by Leonardo da Vinci). They used a spectral method. But, in my idea,we can try to do something using the measurement of the cellulosic DP.Do you agree ?In the past our common friend Dan Porter indicated the book byPeter Silverman (who, the january 30, 1998, was curious about the paintingby Leonard) and then the portrait of the belle princesse (Bianca Sforzapassed away at 13 years old !) was an interesting challenge, an argumentto use in order to show what is possible to obtain with the SPM datingversus the 14C test.Despite the fact that dating of the portrait to 1496 and the identificationof the sitter as Bianca were confirmed to a high level of probabily, theidea to obtain the SPM confirmation can be interesting to developebecause this will show the level of precision for the SPM tests.— —The similar SPM analyses can be applied for the well known ancientdocuments coming from the sites of Qumran …— —If you want to improve some control there is the CFM (= Chemical ForceMicroscopy). So, you can hope to detect also the few molecules of thymol.The CFM can distinguish between distinct chemical regions on a surface.Chemical force microscopy provides quantitative information on the interactions between chemically modified tips and the surface.— —I hope in your answer.— * —Happy New Year 2013 !","date":"December 28, 2012 at 5:06 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/draft-document-discovered-in-the-paper-skip-at-my-local-recycling-centre-ten-killer-arguments-for-opposing-any-re-run-of-the-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"killer_arguments","title":"Draft document discovered in the paper-skip at my local recycling centre: “Ten killer arguments for opposing any re-run of the radiocarbon dating.”"},{"author":"piero_(piedmont)","post":"Personally I think at the Shroud as the authentic relic (2000 years old)that permits to see something about the Holy Face of Jesus.But this is only a personal idea (then this is the reason about the trueepoch to demonstrate, through the adequate controls !).In any case I don’t believe in your destructive way to proceed ! It’s toodestructive, IMO.Instead, using the SPMs (= Scanning Probe Microscopies) we can try toestimate the cellulosic degree of polymerization (= cellulosic DP) andalso try to observe what is the amount of different kind of contaminants,included the thymol (… molecules !!!).I want to add that (in my opinion) perhaps the Raman analyses of the year2002 (in Turin, by Renishaw) were not published because they testifiedthe previous thymol contaminations. Am I wrong in this hard conjecture ?Have you found another more simple explanation about thislack of communication (= ten years !) about the Raman controls ?What is your opinion ?So …We have to choose to do the right controls on right areas.At least we have to ask for new controls using the advanced controls(= AFM or AFM-Raman techniques applied in a careful manner) on linenfibrils taken from the Holy Shroud in the past (= before the thymol treatment)and on linen fibrils taken after the thymol treatment. This is an interestingscientific argument (for a paper).I believe these useful linen samples are already taken and kept apart.Then there is the necessity for an adequate request about the inherent new(and open ?) scientific Committee.Do you agree on that idea ?— —Recently I tried to search for other ways, for example : the ptychographicelectron diffractive imaging at atomic resolution, permitting identificationof structures …If I am right a STEM (= scanning transmission electron microscope)and the X-rays are used to work …The STEM permits a more deep control with respect the AFMtechniques (= superficial controls).But the STEM was an old way with respect the AFM and the CFM.I have not a great knowledge in this interesting field and (unfortunately) in my mind these ways seemed to be more feasiblein the mineral world … I had some doubt.— —There is another way : the scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM).This a particularly useful method for studying the spatial distributionof trace metals (= Sr, etc.) in biological samples. In my idea this is a possibleway to work in order to search the Strontium (that an interesting geographical signature).But (if I am right) this way has a “low” precision (near 30 nm)…The quantitative elemental maps are also interesting for theanalysis of the pollen.Do you know the X-ray fluorescence micro-computed tomography ?In the Web there is some document about the X-ray FluorescenceMicroscopy for Biology and Bionanotechnology.Try to see … I don’t want to be too boring, here.— —What is your idea ?What will be the choice of the future scientific Commission ?What is your prevision ?How to make credible forecasts without the work on the Labsusing the adequate tools ?— —Regards,Piero","date":"November 23, 2012 at 5:31 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/draft-document-discovered-in-the-paper-skip-at-my-local-recycling-centre-ten-killer-arguments-for-opposing-any-re-run-of-the-radiocarbon-dating/","cat":"killer_arguments","title":"Draft document discovered in the paper-skip at my local recycling centre: “Ten killer arguments for opposing any re-run of the radiocarbon dating.”"}]}
