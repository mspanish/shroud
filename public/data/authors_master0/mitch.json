{"misc":[{"author":"mitch","post":"Pope Francis in alienating, upsetting, and worrying a wing of the Church during his first days in office is not the embodiment of humility. I am all for English/Latin mixed, Vat. II and traditional practices in liturgy. I attend both EF and OF Masses. But destroying or simplifying what little is left of the Papal office in complete contrast to the previous Pontificate is disruptive and dare I say harmful to the Church at large. Utterly disrespectful of the office he holds he should have declined his election. One thing he has accomplished in taking apart Tradition and Protocol is too distract the world at large of the need for curial reform and the need to do something more about the abuse crisis. Now everyone is quibbling over the liturgy and vestments once again. Way to go ! Would it not have been more humble to accept the office of the Pope, wear the garb prescribed to it and move immediately to reform the Curia and address the real problems? No, he chooses to open old wounds and stir the pot. Do red shoes really hurt anyone? Brown or red they are either donated or paid for !","date":"March 21, 2013 at 7:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/14/dougherty-in-slate-pope-francis-may-be-a-catholic-nightmare/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dougherty in Slate:  Pope Francis May Be a CatholicÂ Nightmare"}]}
