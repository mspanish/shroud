{"art":[{"author":"diane_wilson","post":"I have a friend who is not flaky in anyway. Her 6 year old son has been having dreams about the end times. The visions are right out of Revelation and the child has never heard the book. His Sunday school is typical Noah’s ark cartooon level. He saw the Akiane Jesus painting without being prodded at all and said that was the Jesus in his dream. I am a true skeptic when it comes to these things but I know this family and God is using this child. There just isn’t enough room here to share all of his dreams. He says these things happen when he’s old like daddy and that mommy is not wrinkly yet  He told mommy that she won’t like what happens but that it would be ok because God’s sword is the strongest ever and kills all evil but he had to get it under the tee. We think the tee is the cross. His agnostic father gave his life to the Lord in December because his son’s dreams were undeniable. Acts tells us in the last days that the young will see visions and the old will dream dreams. I absolutly believe God is in this and he is raising up children who will serve him in this generation","date":"April 13, 2012 at 12:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
