{"art":[{"author":"alma","post":"hello, my mom passed on 9/24/12. she had gotten ill on 8/20/12, about a week before as I was picking up my room I heard a voice tell me “the end is near ” I was scared, and rushed to see my mom, she seemed ok, and forgot about the voice. on 8/20/12 she became ill with stomach pains, took her to the hospital and it was gallblader. the doctor keept calling the G.I. to come in to take an obstruction out of her, well he never showed up, her hearth started to give out and a pacemaker was put in, she was released to go home with the obstruction on 8/27/12, on 8/28/12 she became sicker and I rushed to her room and she said her left leg hurts, I bend down on her bed and told her a voice was telling me she would loose her leg, she said” NO ” we went to the hospital, and the doctors could not save it and she lost it.  No body put attention to our complaints about her stomach pains, NO ONE! she was transfered to another hospital on 9/13/12, on the 15th she was not breathing, she was put on a ventilator, and on 9/24/12 at 5am I woke up to a phone call from the hospital, I was dreaming with my mom, she was with 3 angels, one was by her right side, the second was kneeling down cleaning her legs, the third was on her left, he was in white, my mom was smiling at me, she had a lot of light around her, and she was smiling at me! my mom passed away at 5:04am.  I miss her terribly, but GOD gave me this vision to see where my mother is, she is ALIVE, she has everlasting life with JESUS! before this I had a talk with my mom, she said her nephew( passed away about 10 yrs ago ) was telling her that she was not going to get better, that they where fixing her room and bed where she would rest, and that they where going running together, she replied she only has one leg, and she was told here you are going to have 2 legs, you are going to love it here, and that he visits his mother,( his mom confirm this, she claims she can smell his cooking).God speaks to us in dreams,  I was able to see her room, her bed, and she was/is happy! I still cry, I miss her lots,I keep telling my self what if I would have taken her to another hospital, what if?","date":"January 31, 2013 at 10:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"alma","post":"if you find one let us all know, and where to get it. thank you.","date":"January 31, 2013 at 10:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
