Shortly after the Shroud emerged it was declared a fake by the bishop who discovered the artist.”In the literature, we find references to shrouds of Milan, Lodz, Nice, Aix-la-Chapelle and Besançon, among others. Concerning this issue of relic-forging, Dr. Gerald Larue remarks:Carbon-14 dating has demonstrated that the shroud is a 14th-century forgery and is one of many such deliberately created relics produced in the same period, all designed to attract pilgrims to specific shrines to enhance and increase the status and financial income of the local church.","date":"September 30, 2013 at 2:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/29/in-case-you-missed-in-case-you-missed-it/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"In Case You Missed, “In Case You Missed It”"},{"author":"julie_fantham","post":"Thanks Hugh, Should’ve said refutes not information.
