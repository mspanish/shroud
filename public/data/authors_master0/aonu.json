The bible describes the taking away of Enoch the 7th from Adam as being “translated” — might this be some kind of removing to a different, higher dimension (ie, the 3rd heaven?) here postulated?And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. –Gen 5.24By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony [cf. v3 By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.], that he pleased God. –Heb 11.5, v3 in brackets.An interesting point on the invisible giving substance to the physical world and Enoch being taken to this invisible dimension perhaps.The other time in the New Testament a similar language and theme is used is in Colossians 1.12-17: Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: [his…: Gr. the Son of his love] In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.The translation here is associated with inheriting light. Is there light during the translation process I wonder?Elijah the prophet is also said to have been taken up. We are told he left behind a shroud-like cloth from his body at the time, a mantle. Elisha the prophet ‘took up the mantle’ (where this phrase originally alludes to) and used it to strike the Jordan river speaking “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” and then crossed over when the water parted. Read 2 Kings 2.11-14Is this a prophetic preview of the cloth left behind before Christ ascended? Is the shroud here to help us cross the waters of chaos as we ask where is the Lord God?The last words recorded between Elijah and Elisha in 2 Kings 2.9-10: When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.” And Elisha said, “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.” He said, “You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so.”Do you see Christ when he was taken in the shroud?","date":"July 1, 2015 at 7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"author":"aonu","post":"I might add that after Elijah was taken up Elisha tore apart his own clothes, then he took up Elijah’s mantle (2Ki2.12-4).

Is this a reference to the mantle? If so, why are they associating the spirit of Elijah with his mantle? Could this be another prophetic preview in light of the burial shroud of Christ? Is the image on the shroud an image of Christ’s spirit at the time of his translation? Maybe the reason Elisha rent his clothes after Elijah’s translation was because he thought he missed seeing Elisha taken away thus failing to fulfill the terms needed to gain a double portion of Elijah’s spirit, or so he thought (vv9-10), after all the text says a chariot of fire came between them and took Elijah away (v11). But when the sons of the prophets saw Elisha wearing Elijah’s mantle they understood he had the spirit of Elijah on him seeming to indicate it bore some mark or image of Elijah’s spirit when he was translated, thus fulfilling the terms, just as the shroud of Christ bears the image of his spirit at the time of his translation.","date":"July 2, 2015 at 6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"author":"aonu","post":"Dave, the difference between my interpretation (which I have not seen put forth before vis a vis the image) and others is that mine helps answer some of the other curious elements of the narrative (why Elisha was so upset when Elijah left after he had already accepted the fact; how the double portion was fulfilled ie, 1. Elijah’s spiritual power over the elements such as parting water and 2. Elijah’s spiritual image) which are otherwise left, well, a curiosity and only guessed at (ie, Passing of the mantle = passing of the office, yet there is no biblical precedence for this and prophets had been carrying on long long before Elijah and Elisha and long after. On the other hand what I’m suggesting sets a precedence which is followed up by Christ and the shroud and this is one thing God seems to always do particularly with important events, that is he sets up foreshadows and patterns fulfilled later to a higher degree so that we will know the certainty of a matter). On its face we have important and rare elements that clearly sync up: Christ’s translation (if you will) and Elijah’s translation as well as leaving behind coverings from their persons at the event and both taken up in some type of powerful meteorological event described as a whirlwind or vortex (the chariot(s) apparently didn’t take Elijah up closer examination of the text (v11) but only really served to separate Elijah and Elisha), Acts 1.9 refers to a cloud and even gives us an important detail that the departure happened out of their sight, which helps us understand that Elijah too must’ve been taken out of the sight of Elisha and so didn’t fulfill the terms for the double portion as most would think without a deeper understanding of the text in view of the shroud Christ left behind. The image on the shroud isn’t made obvious in the text, particularly John’s Gospel, but leaves enough of a hint that isn’t (can’t be?) fully realized until the shroud image is seen just as the proposed image on Elijah’s mantle isn’t made obvious in the text until the shroud image is made known.Now the other elements less obvious in the picture I simply connect the dots to sync it up more clearly, thus providing us some deeper insights when the OT and NT texts are played off against each other. That’s what good interpretations are supposed to do, almost like a science. A parallel example would be Isaiah’s suffering servant which most Christians clearly see as a preview of Jesus because important elements sync up with the narrative in the NT about the Passion of Jesus and his sufferings, once that is established we can learn more about Jesus’ sufferings from Isaiah which are not mentioned in the NT. A similar phenomenon occurs between the narratives surrounding Elijah’s mantle and Christ’s shroud.Joseph was also a typology of Jesus, and he too left behind a special garment bearing bloody marks which was used as evidence of his death though he did live and was enthroned next to the king (Pharaoh) after his brethren rejected him and he ruled over the Gentiles but eventually revealed himself to his brethren and opened their eyes and saved them. This is a prophetic preview of Jesus and still his brethren reject him today.","date":"July 4, 2015 at 9:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"author":"aonu","post":"Nabber, I understand what you mean, but the authors of the bible saw fit to conceal things only to be revealed when those with eyes to see could see.

Not only do the gospels taken together say Joseph brought linen and Nicodemus brought spices, John’s gospel tells us they were following the burial customs of the Jews. Fortunately we need only skip back one gospel to find key information on what a Jewish burial entails in the time of Christ as we have a funeral in progress complete with the procession and means of carrying the body to its resting place recorded in Luke 7:11-15. Luke tells us that the dead body was carried on a “bier” as the King James bible puts it (as do many others).“Now when he [Jesus] came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.” Luke 7:12-14 (KJV)According to AV1611.com (King James bible dictionary online), a bier is “A carriage or frame of wood for conveying dead human bodies to the grave.”No mention of “transport linen” anywhere because that was not the Jewish burial custom, neither is such indicated in the bible or Jewish sources, nor should we expect otherwise from the burial of Jesus Christ when John wants us to know Jewish burial custom was followed. Nicodemus who was a religious teacher, a Pharisee, and a member of the Sanhedrin along with Joseph would have known as well as any how to conduct a Jewish funeral properly, particularly for the Jewish messiah in whom they believed in. The OT also bears witness to the burial custom of transporting dead bodies on a bier/bed and what may be its inclusion in the actual burial in the second example:2 Samuel 3:31 (KJV) And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier. {KJV note, bier: Heb. bed}2 Chronicles 16:14 (KJV) And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him. {KJV note, had made: Heb. had digged}According to http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3842-burial:“Coffins, though used in Egypt (Gen. 1.26), were not in general use in Biblical times; in most cases the dead were carried out to the burial-place upon a bed or bier (“miṭṭah,” II Sam. iii. 31; Ber. iii. 1; Josephus, “Ant.” xvii. 8, § 3, κλίυη; compare II Kings xiii. 21, and the story of the sham funeral of Johanan ben Zakkai, Giṭ. 56a). Occasionally coffins were used, either of wood or of stone (M. Ḳ. 8b; Yer. M. Ḳ. i. 80d), those of wood suggestive of the tree which brought death to man (Gen. R. xix.); cedarwood, “which does not decay,” being preferred (Test. Patr., Simeon, 8; compare Levi, 19; Zebulon, 10). In France it became customary to use for the coffin-boards the table upon which food for the poor had been served (Baḥya b. Asher, commentary to Ex. xxv.).At first the bier used for the rich was more elaborate than that used for the poor; later, simplicity and equality became the rule (M. Ḳ. 27b).”So the Jewish custom was to use a bier or bed, rarely a coffin — no makeshift stretcher of linen here. And how did John say Jesus was buried? By Jewish customs.According to the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia at http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/B/BURIAL/:“Missionaries and natives of Syria tell us that it is still customary to wash the body (compare Acts 9:37), anoint it with aromatic ointments (compare Jn 12:7; 19:39; Mk 16:1; Lk 24:1), swathe hands and feet in grave-bands, usually of linen (Jn 11:44a), and cover the face or bind it about with a napkin or handkerchief (Jn 11:44b).”According to http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ancientburial.html:“Bodies were buried clothed and carried to the tomb on a bier (II Sam. 3:31), but not in a coffin. Joseph’s coffin is to be understood as Egyptian custom (Gen. 50:26).”John 19:39 states Nicodemus brought 75 to 100 lbs of myrrh and aloes mixture (KJV says 100 lbs). Seeing as how the crucifixion and burial was outside the city gates/camp (again following Jewish custom as shown in Luke 7:12, John 11:30 and elsewhere) it’s highly unlikely Nicodemus by himself and in old age (John 3:4) carried these by hand alone. Either he had help or he brought them with some form of transportation (chariot, wagon, horse, etc) and so a bier could have been brought along by whatever means was used for this or even itself used to carry the spices, we simply are not told how but only that the Jewish burial custom was indeed followed and we know the custom always had a bier/bed/coffin for body transport and fortunately for elder men like Joseph and Nicodemus it was not a long transport (John 19:41).","date":"July 14, 2015 at 7:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne"},{"author":"aonu","post":"“Thanks again David.

Gospel of Nicodemus which we might expect to elaborate on such issues), no he enters the picture near the beginning in a passage continuing the main thrust of John’s opening: the need to be born from the beginning (misinterpreted as ‘born again’ ironically as modern translators make the same mistake Nicodemus did as the Greek has multiple definitions ((albeit it’s hard to express whats happening without a note)) which NT scholars use to claim Jesus and Nico spoke Greek here, however the Aramaic also has multiple definitions, only the latter has a definition that connects with John’s opening, “in the beginning,” hence born in the beginning/in the Word “Miltha”/from the head, etc).. side issue but helps show Nicodemus was not an ad hoc vehicle to deliver a second shroud nowhere hinted at. He appears again in chapter 7 defending Jesus in the Sanhedrin of which he and Joseph of Arimathea were members. Luke also has linen in the empty tomb without a mention of Nicodemus who only appears in John’s gospel. Nicodemus simply isn’t necessary for burial cloths.The text specifically states Nicodemus provided the burial spices (Jn 19:39) just as the text specifically states Joseph provided the linen, “And he [Joseph] bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock..” Mk 15:46 (ESV), or if you don’t like that rendering, KJV: “And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock..” etc.I reiterate, the text never states Joseph’s shroud was ever discarded or that Nicodemus brought any, and the text even mentions Joseph’s linen was used with spices as would be expected for burial in John 19:40, “So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.” Is there any good reason why Joseph’s linen wouldn’t be used for burial after it was already packed with burial spices said it was used in the burial custom or is this just desperate denial?","date":"July 12, 2015 at 11:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne"},{"author":"aonu","post":"I hope you understand I was being generous by also consulting any outside texts, dubious or not.
