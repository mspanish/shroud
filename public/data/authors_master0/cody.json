{"art":[{"author":"cody","post":"Alright this may sounds a little nutty or something. Im 26 year old man and I have attended church on and off again for a very long time. My life hasnt exactly been down the greatest path I wish I could change alot of things but this is a small story I would like to share with everybody and maybe it will change my life. Hopefully it truely does. About a year ago I had a dream of an angel, this angel was tall Im talking unreal it was tall and we were standing above Im not sure if it was the a city in particular or every city on earth mixed into one but it was huge as far as the eye could see. He gave me a letter and the letter was one that was one like parchment paper and his exact words to me were “Only two people will ever recieve this letter on earth, this is for you, this is from God” And when I awoke I was so astonished that I had completely forgot what the letter said. If the person is out there that had this same dream or somebody could tell me the meaning behind this please do so. Thank you.","date":"August 23, 2011 at 11:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
