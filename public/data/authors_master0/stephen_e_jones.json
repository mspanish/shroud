No. The Shroud is fully consistent with the Bible and in fact supports the Gospels' account of Jesus suffering, death and resurrection. As an evangelical Christian, the Shroud would never have got to first base with me if there were major discrepencies between it and the Bible.There are many books on the Shroud by Christians who have pointed that out. For example, Stevenson & Habermas' \"Verdict on the Shroud\" (1981) have a whole chapter, \"The New Testament and the Shroud.\" Their \"The Shroud and the Controversy\" (1990) answers many other Biblical objections. Habermas is a leading Bible-believing evangelical theologian and he fully deals with all the Biblical issues.>This article points out in the light of the Bible that the shroud of Turin is a fake: http://koti.phnet.fi/petripaavola/shroudofturin.htmlThanks for the link. But the article is wrong on all its key points. Significantly his reference list does not include any actual books on the Shroud, which discuss the Biblical and Jewish issues at depth. It is typical of well-meaning but uninformed criticism of the Shroud by some Christians. Also, many of the leading Shroud advocates are Jewish, including Barrie Schwortz, the owner of the world's leading Shroud website, Shroud.com, and in online interviews he has defended the compatibility of the Shroud with both 1st century Jewish custom and the Bible. A Jewish scholar called Victor Tunkel has defended the Shroud's compatibility with 1st century Jewish burial customs. A Google search on \"Shroud\" and \"Tunkel\" together will bring up quotes by him defending the Shroud's authenticity from a Jewish perspective.

The newly found cloth is made up of a simpler two-way weave.\" Yes, and that there was more than one style of weaving in the first century is nothing new.>The Jesus burial shroud was supplied by Joseph of Arimathea, who donated his own prepared tomb for the burial of Jesus. Which is itself an amazing proof of the overriding hand of God in the crucifixion and burial of Jesus. There `just happened' to be a rich man, who `just happened' to be a disciple of Jesus who `just happened' to own an unused tomb:Mt 27:57-60. 57 When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. 58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.near to the site of Jesus' crucifixion:John 19:38-42. 38 After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus ... asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body. 39 Nicodemus also ... 40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths ... 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 42 So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.and who `just happened' to be a member of the Jewish Sanhedrin, so he could obtain permission from Pilate to take Jesus body and bury it:Lk 23:50-53. 50 Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council ... 52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 53 Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid.>... Joseph was a wealthy man, traveled to distant lands, obviously the shroud was the finest he could find – not a local weave. It doesn't follow that the fine linen shroud which Joseph \"bought\" in the Jerusalem markets (Mk 15:46 \"bought\" is Gk. agorasas \"bought in an agora - a market\"), was \"not a local weave\". >He had prepared the tomb and obviously the \"fine linen' cloth for his own use. The tomb yes, but not the cloth. Mt 27:60 says of the former that it was Joseph's \"own new tomb,\" but none of the Gospels say that of the Shroud. And Mk 15:46 says that Joseph had \"bought\" the shroud but not that he had bought the tomb also. So there is a clear distinction that Joseph already owned the tomb but he had to buy the Shroud that day.>The fact that the recent found cloth was a 'simpler two-way weave' doesn't prove that the Turin Shroud could not be authentic???? Agreed. It's so fallacious it is amazing that a scholar could have said it, and that a journalist could uncritically report it.>In addition, perhaps the fact that the cloth was so fine/expensive, is the reason it was saved, not discarded after the resurrection???It may have been a factor. But the fact that it was Jesus' burial shroud left behind after His resurrection was a more compelling reason why the disciples did not leave Jesus' burial clothes in the now empty tomb to be taken by graverobbers.In support of this is the fact that another item of Jesus' graveclothes, the Sudarium of Oviedo, was also saved and not discarded, and there is nothing intrinsically valuable about that.

It seems as though many Christians today of a variety of camps, think that something so fantastic is very questionable. We are all infected to varying degrees with the dominant philosophy of our age, Naturalism, i.e. nature is all there is, there is no supernatural.I have debated with Christians who are almost practical atheists, i.e. they live almost as though there is no God.Then there are Protestant Christians who are opposed to the Shroud because it is Roman Catholic, not realising there were no Protestants until 1517 and   the RC church did not own the Shroud until 1983 and it has always hedged its bets on the Shroud's authenticity. A quote in historian Robert Drews' (a non-Christian who accepts the Shroud is 1st century and of Jesus but it is a form of imprinting now lost to us) book hits the nail on the head, why even most Christians (including me until 2005) dismiss the Shroud out of hand as a fake, \"The Shroud ... is obviously too good to be true.\"\"That the scholarly world has been so reluctant to turn its attention to the Shroud may at first glance seem puzzling, but is explicable all the same. The Shroud is a sheet of linen bearing frontal and dorsal images of a body said to be the crucified body of Jesus Christ. This sensational, or even preposterous, claim is itself an explanation for the indifference of scholarly historians: an object touted as a memento from the crucifixion of Jesus, and so from the central episode in Western history, is obviously too good to be true.\" (Drews, R., \"In Search of the Shroud of Turin: New Light on Its History and Origins,\" Rowman & Allanheld: Totowa NJ, 1984, p.2).>But from my viewpoint, the same Lord that was raised to life, could certainly allow for such a blessing to be deposited in a physical form. He is just that wonderful to us!Yes.

Yes. See \"Cloths from the Masada Fortress and their Implications in the Quest for the Historical Jesus.\">Shroud of Turin yarn has not uniform color due to chemical bleaching producing image artifacts the so called variegated pattern.In medieval times artisans after weaving the fabric used to bleach it by sunlight so it could have uniform color.Another good point. That `medieval forger' must have been VERY clever to think of that also! ;-)>Another important aspect,topmost fibers of Shroud of Turin threads have a polysaccharide layer -which by a chemical process of dehydration and oxidation changed color producing the image effect.this polysacccharide layer is just the residue of washing the cloth in a saponaria officinalis solutionWhich is a plant \"Common Soapwort (Saponaria officinalis) ... a common perennial plant from the carnation family ... The scientific name Saponaria is derived from the Latin sapo (stem sapon-) meaning \"soap,\" which, like its common name, refers to its utility in cleaning. ... Soapwort's native range extends throughout Europe to western Siberia [including Israel] ... As the name implies, it can be used as a very gentle soap, usually in dilute solution. It has been used to clean delicate or unique fabrics, such as the Turin shroud for example.\" (\"Common Soapwort,\" Wikipedia, 8 August 2009).>The way the Shroud of Turin was made fits with the method described by roman historian of first century Pliny the Elder in his book Natural History.Yes. See \"Pliny the Elder - Natural History.\" How could a forger know all this? And why would he BOTHER in the 14th century (actually the 7th century or earlier because he would also have had to have forged the Sudarium of Oviedo) when the public then would have been fooled by FAR LESS?>The 3:1 herringbone twill of the Shroud indicates no doubt an expensive fabric but Joseph of Arimathea was wealthy enough to afford it.Yes. Mt 27:57 says that Joseph of Arimathea was \"a rich man\" and Mk 15:46 says he \"bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock.\" That is, Joseph of Arimathea , who was \"a disciple of Jesus\" (Mt 27:57; Jn 19:38), and risked all to claim the crucified body of Jesus and then buried it in his own new tomb, would have bought the most expensive linen shroud available in Jerusalem. So in that sense the Shroud was not typical, because it was top-of-the-range 1st century Jewish. >Trying to disauthenticate the Shroud of Turin with such a weak claim is ludicrous.Agreed.

Click on the image of della Rovere’s aquatint above to enlarge it. Note that in the copy of the Shroud held by angels, the spear wound bloodstain is on the opposite side of the uppermost hand.

So it may be that he wanted to emphasise Jesus' youthfulness, and perhaps also to de-emphasise His and John's Jewishness (due to medieval anti-Semitism).I have now corrected the post above, that the PM's Jesus: \"... does not have a moustache: the dark line below His nose is apparently His upper lip, as the women also have a similar line.\"But in looking at my close-up of of the Shroud Man's face compared with that of the PM, I became more aware of, and added:\"... the faintly tinged red mark on the PM's right forehead, exactly where the `reversed 3' bloodstain is on the Shroud and, like it, slightly angled in a `northeast-southwest' direction! This actually is a Vignon Marking, the only one found on the PM, which is evidence that the Shroud was not copied from the PM. There also appear to be crown of thorns bloodstains in the PM Jesus' hair, corresponding with some on the Shroud. It is these positive unique similarities between the PM and the Shroud which are of far greater significance than negative minor differences like the PM having no moustache, which can simply be accounted for by human error.\"Stephen E.

Agreed. But Wikipedia is usually OK for most things. As I said in my post above, Wikipedia's strength is its weakness: anyone can edit it. That means that an anonymous someone who has read little or no books in the Shroud but who relies on what he/she reads on the Internet, can edit a Wikipedia article on the Shroud, and it sounds authoritative to members of the public, including young people, who don't know any better.>Anyways a couple of points to the Pray Manuscript drawing at the top of this page; 1. I tend to believe there is actually a second cloth represented in the bottom image, which extends beyond the Shroud slightly towards the Alpha symbol.Yes there undoubtedly is a cloth arising out of the midst of the Shroud. But it is difficult to interpret. The upper Shroud border is visible through it, and the Xs on the Shroud continue across it, so presumably it is not intended to be a physical cloth but a symbol of the grave clothes that the angel is pointing to as evidence that Jesus was not there and had risen. This is supported by the face of the Shroud in profile, in a line with it and the letter, which could be an alpha. I must remember that the artist was not probably not an expert on the Shroud, nor in 1st century Jewish burial practices, but simply drew what he saw on the Shroud before him and added information to better tell the Gospels' story of Jesus' burial and resurrection. As I mentioned in a previous comment, there is no Biblical reason for the artist not to depict other cloths, because in four places (Lk 24:12; Jn 19:40; 20:5,6,7) the Gospels mention that \"linen cloths\" were left behind in the empty tomb after Jesus' resurrection, without stating what they were.>I have not come to a conclusion of whether it is depicting the face cloth or 'more likely' the strips which would have been used to bind the Shroud around the body.Thanks for the insight! The `bar' across the head opening, which I had been puzzling over (and had just said a quick prayer to the One whose image is on the Shroud to help me understand what it is!) was probably meant to symbolise the chin-band, which was used in 1st century Jewish to keep the jaw from opening. And which many sindonologists thought was meant by the \"napkin\" [Gk. soudarion] in John 20:7 (KJV):\"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\"But since the discovery of the Sudarium of Oviedo, most now think that the soudarion was that, and the chin-band was among the \"linen strips\" [Gk. keira] used in 1st century Jewish burials to bind the hands, feet and jaw in place, and mentioned in the account of Lazarus' raising from the dead in John 11:44 (ESV):\"The man [Lazarus] who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips [Gk. keira], and his face wrapped with a cloth [Gk. soudarion]. Jesus said to them, `Unbind him, and let him go.'\"[continued]","date":"May 29, 2012 at 8:25 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/05/my-critique-of-pray-codex-wikipedia-1.html","title":"My critique of \"The Pray Codex,\" Wikipedia, 1 May 2011"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>I also think the face image cloth hanging from the ladies arm is depicting more likely the Sudarium...your thoughts? No. For one simple reason an artist in 12th century Hungary (and indeed anyone in Constantinople at the time) would be unlikely to know what the \"Sudarium\" (later called \"of Oviedo\") was. It was in Spain since at least the 9th century and took an entirely different route from the Shroud via Africa getting to Spain:\"According to this history, the sudarium was in Palestine until shortly before the year 614, when Jerusalem was attacked and conquered by Chosroes II, who was king of Persia from 590 to 628. It was taken away to avoid destruction in the invasion, first to Alexandria by the presbyter Philip, then across the north of Africa when Chosroes conquered Alexandria in 616. The sudarium entered Spain at Cartagena, along with people who were fleeing from the Persians. The bishop of Ecija, Fulgentius, welcomed the refugees and the relics, and surrendered the chest, or ark, to Leandro, bishop of Seville. He took it to Seville, where it spent some years. \" (Guscin, M., \"The Sudarium of Oviedo: Its History and Relationship to the Shroud of Turin,\" 1997)So I interpret the face in profile behind Mary Magdalene's right arm as the artist's way of depicting Jesus having risen. His depiction of Jesus' image on the Shroud is the upper Entombment scene.Remember that Byzantine and medieval artists did not depict Jesus as dead, but living and reigning. So they used the Shroud as a basis for their Christ Pantocrator (\"Christ All-ruling\" icons), and converted bloodstains on the Shroud into locks of hair, and red crosses (as you say below) etc, on their icons.>Secondly; I believe the image which many mistake for the sephulchre is actually the Shroud, with all the red x's as it also depicts the holes of the burn marks and I think the red is to imply blood on the inside of the cloth....Anyways, just a couple of thoughts.Agreed. I have just received de Wesselow's book, and, as an art historian, he has useful things to say about the Pray Manuscript. He also agrees that the red crosses and `poker holes' are meant to be on the Shroud. He maintains the Hungarian artist saw the Shroud in Constantinople, and says there were close connections between Hungary and Constantinople in the 12th century. De Wesselow also suggests that the reason the artist did not depict the Shroud itself was because at the time artists were not permitted to do that (presumably because that then would be a second Shroud). While I regard de Wesselow's theory that Jesus' resurrection was the image on the Shroud as absurd, and against all the New Testament evidence, nevertheless, his agnostic art historian support for the Shroud being authentic will be immensely valuable to the Shroud pro-authenticity cause. I will use what de Wesselow's says about the Pray Manuscript in my Wikipedia update.The Joe Nickell's of this world will find it more difficult to peddle their lies that those who believe the Shroud is authentic are all crazy Christian religious fanatics (I actually heard Nickell say words to this effect in a Coast-to-Coast radio debate with Barrie Schwortz).Stephen E.

Agreed. Some of the limitations of the Pray Manuscript's depictions of the Shroud are: 1) the PM it is not a photograph, but a work of medieval Christian art; 2) the codex itself is only 235 x 150 mm (Berkovits, 1969, p.103), so the artist had to fit a lot in a small space; 3) the artist worked only in ink and used only three colours-red, blue and black; 4) he may not have understood much about the Shroud itself, and 1st century Jewish burials, as we understand them today; 5) he may have not been a great artist (de Wesselow thinks he \"was not particularly skilful\") and may have made mistakes (e.g. did not exactly  depict the `poker holes'-assuming he even intended to do that-he may have intended to symbolically depict them all by two compound patters); and 6) he may have been under what de Wesselow calls \"a code of secrecy\" which restricted what he could depict, e.g. he could not copy the Shroud itself, presumably because that would become a `second Shroud' and an object of veneration in itself-as later Shroud copies became.Although surprisingly, and thankfully, the artist was allowed to depict Jesus nude, albeit modestly by placing both His arms and hands over His pelvic area. In plate II which depicts Jesus being taken down from the Cross, He is also nude but because His hands could not reasonably cover His genitals, the artist has Jesus wearing a girdle. Personally I think the PM's artist was very skilfull and managed to fit in a lot of meaning, within the limits he faced.>But the two most compelling factors remain:1. The position of the nude Jesus in the artwork, strikingly similar to the image of Christ on the shroudYes. And art historian de Wesselow confirms that only the Pray Manuscript and the Shroud (and of course later post-1350 copies of the Shroud) show Jesus totally nude, his frontal modesty only being preserved by His hands crossed over His pelvic area.While not shown on the PM, the dorsal side of the Shroud, showing Jesus' totally nude, with nothing to preserve His modesty, is even more inexplicable, unless the Shroud image really is a \"snapshot of the resurrection\":\"Even from the limited available information, a hypothetical glimpse of the power operating at the moment of creation of the Shroud's image may be ventured. In the darkness of the Jerusalem tomb the dead body of Jesus lay, unwashed, covered in blood, on a stone slab. Suddenly, there is a burst of mysterious power from it. In that instant the blood dematerializes, dissolved perhaps by the flash, while its image and that of the body becomes indelibly fused onto the cloth, preserving for posterity a literal `snapshot' of the Resurrection.\" (Wilson, I., \"The Shroud of Turin,\" 1979, p.251).De Wesselow also confirms my point in my previous comment that the artist has depicted the Shroud symbolically (being not permitted to depict it literally).>2. The herringbone bone weave-like pattern at the bottom of the image, with the 4 poker holes in the L shape.I have just realised that on the Pray Manuscript there are 5 L-shaped circles, not 4 as I had been writing. So I am going to call them the 5 L-shaped and 5 P-shaped circles/`poker holes'.>Any notion that these holes are some kind of pattern or motif without any connection to the poker holes on the shroud is illogical. A decorative pattern comprising the circles would surely have been in a symmetrical pattern, rather than the asymmetrical pattern of the 4 L shaped poker hole alignment.Agreed. If the sets of L-shaped and P-shaped circles were a decorative pattern, they would have been repeated together across the whole Shroud depiction. They clearly are meant to represent the `poker holes' on certain parts only on the herringbone weave of the Shroud.Stephen E.

De Wesselow points out that on Jesus' left hand, in the upper \"The Entombment\" (which he calls \"The Anointing\") scene, the thumb should be clearly visible (because we are looking directly at the thumb side of Jesus crossed left hand).This is inexplicable unless the PM artist was faithfully depicting Jesus' hands on the Shroud, which also have no thumbs visible (due to the thumb being retracted into the palm when the median nerve is damaged by a crucifixion nail).This was one of the items of anatomical accuracy on the Shroud image which made surgeon Pierre Barbet ask, \"Could a forger have imagined this?\":\"But these experiments had yet another surprise in store for me. I have stressed the point that I was operating on hands which still had life in them immediately after the amputation of the arm. Now, I observed on the first occasion, and regularly from then onwards, that at the moment when the nail went through the soft anterior parts, the palm being upwards, the thumb would bend sharply and would be exactly facing the palm by the contraction of the thenar muscles, while the four fingers bent very slightly; this was probably caused by the reflex mechanical stimulation of the long flexor tendons. Now, dissections have revealed to me that the trunk of the median nerve is always seriously injured by the nail; it is divided into sections, being broken sometimes halfway and sometimes two-thirds of the way across, according to the case. And the motor nerves of the oponens muscles and of the short flexor muscle of the thumb branches at this level off the median nerve. The contraction of these thenar muscles, which were still living like their motor nerve, could be easily explained by the mechanical stimulation of the median nerve. Christ must then have agonised and died and have become fixed in the cadaverous rigidity, with the thumbs bent inwards into His palms. And that is why, on the shroud, the two hands when seen from behind only show four fingers, and why the two thumbs are hidden in the palms. Could a forger have imagined this? Would he have dared to portray it? Indeed, so true is this that many ancient copyists of the shroud have added the thumbs; in the same way they have separated the feet and shown their forward faces with two nail holes; but none of this is to be seen on the shroud. (Barbet, P., \"A Doctor at Calvary,\" 1963, pp.118-119. Emphasis original).And even in the unlikely event that a medieval forger could have imagined it, he wouldn't have depicted it because his contemporaries would not understand why he did it, and so would consider it a flaw.Which is the another reason why the Pray Manuscript's \"The Entombment\" (Plate III) scene is based on the Shroud. Significantly in the same artist's \"The Deposition\" (Plate II) and \"Christ Enthroned\" (Plate IV), where he is not depicting the Shroud, he shows Jesus with thumbs!Stephen E.

Therefore the Shroud must have existed well before the 1192-95 Pray Manuscript.>Furthermore you won;t actually see the \"herringbone\" pattern on the shroud unless your are very close up to it...so it's unlikely the artist would put the herringbone pattern in his picture.There is no reason why the artist could not have seen the Shroud very close up.>Imagaine I drew a TV picture onto a page...I would ONLY see the tiny pixels when I am close up to the screen...so I am highly unlikely to draw a rectangle with small square pixels...why on Earth would this artist draw the herring bone pattern if you can only see it close up?Because he was close up to the Shroud!Also, it's a false analogy between pixels on a TV screen and the herringbone weave of the Shroud. The former is not part of the object being represented, but the latter is.>What about the closes of the other people...when viewed close up you would see various inticate patterns and stitchings...but we don't see that in the picture...and what about close up views of the bodies you would see body and facial hair on the skin...how come this isn't in the picture but the herringbone pattern is?A drawing is not a photograph. Artists always leave some things out, according to what they deem to be the most important. Besides, plate III does have Christ's facial hair: eyebrows, moustache and beard.>THE only conclusion you can really draw from this is that the Pray Manuscript is NOT very strong proof at all as regards to the Turin Shroud dating.No, you are deceiving yourself, by denying what is obvious, presumably because you don't want to accept that the Shroud is the burial sheet of Jesus, bearing the image of His crucified, dead and resurrected body!Stephen E.

What might it mean?I don't know. I am not an art expert and nor can I read Hungarian.>Also, is that an image of the shroud's peaceful, closed eyes head behind the right arm of the apostle?The lower part of the above Plate IV seems to be depicting the scene in Mark 16:1-6, where in the empty tomb a \"young man\" (i.e. an angel) tells the three women disciples, \"Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome\" (John's mother) that Jesus had risen and points to the place where His body had been laid:\"1 When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. 2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. 3 And they were saying to one another, `Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?' 4 And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back— it was very large. 5 And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. 6 And he said to them, `Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him.'\"So presumably the head near Mary Magdalene's right arm is meant to represent Jesus' resurrected body?Stephen E.

With his feet that would be about 135 mm. Twice that would be about 270 mm.The folded over shroud in the lower part of Plate III measures about 146+116 = about 260 mm. But like the feet, the far right edge of the Shroud is not shown.So while that is not exactly \"twice the length of the man,\" it is close enough to it(bearing in mind that the far right edge of the Shroud is not shown), to reasonably conclude that the artist intended to depict the ~4 metre (~14 foot) Shroud of Turin (as it now is called).>The only thing I can think of is that you are interpreting what I think is the tomb (with the red crosses) as part of the shroud.What you are intepreting as the tomb, is in fact the Shroud. The red crosses are the artist's depiction of the Shroud's herringbone weave pattern. And again the two parts add up to about twice the length of Jesus' body, as the Shroud is.>Likewise, I can't understand the reference to the L shaped pattern of holes on \"the front and the back\". Clearly there is the L shaped pattern of 4 holes on the object which the angel is standing on,That \"object which the angel is standing on\" is part of the depicted Shroud. The 4 L-shaped circles match exactly one set of 4 L-shaped holes on the Shroud.>but I interpret the circular objects on the object below it with the red crosses (which I think is the tomb) as decorative.Why would the tomb be decorated with red crosses? Besides, the angel, women and the Shroud are in the tomb. And part of the tomb itself can be seen in the background behind the angel. The holes amongst the red crosses (the herringbone weave) are another set of the total of four sets of burn holes in the Shroud, not all of which are L-shaped. Click on this 1516 Liere copy of the Shroud link.>Also, if the painting is a copy of the shroud why is Jesus's body in the top part of the painting free of wounds and blood stains?The Byzantines were reluctant to depict bloodstains on their icon copies of Shroud, e.g. they depicted the reversed \"3\" bloodstain on the Shroud as a lock of hair. On Plate II where Jesus' body is being taken down from the Cross the artist doesn't depict any bloodstains on it there either. Only on Plate IV, does the artist depict Jesus as having red bloodspots on His hands and side.>Also, does Jesus in the painting have a beard? At best I can pick out whiskers!It is a beard, albeit not a heavy one as like Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus' are in the upper part of Plate III (above). But if you look at Shroudscope's Face only Vertical, which is how the artist would have seen it (a photographic negative), Jesus' beard does not appear to be heavy. Which itself is more evidence that the Pray Manuscript artist worked directly from the Shroud!Thanks for your comments, but as per my stated policy (see above) that: \"Each individual will usually be allowed only one comment under each post.

It is a form of scientific fraud to state the result of a scientific test without acknowledging the evidence against your result.The standard of scientific honesty that all scientists, including those involved in the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, should adhere to is that set by the late Professor of Physics at Caltech, Richard P. Feynman (1918–1988) (my emphasis):\"It's a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty - a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid-not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, And how they worked-to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated. Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can-if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong-to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it ... the idea is to try to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another ... I'm talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how you're maybe wrong, that you ought to have when acting as a scientist.\" (Feynman, R.P., 1985, \"Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!,\" Unwin Paperbacks: London, Reprinted, 1990, pp.340-343)Stephen E.

A toe belonging to King Tutankhamun’s father has been finally returned to Egypt, the Supreme Council of Antiquities said on Wednesday. The bone piece belonged to mummy KV55, which was identified as Akhenaton during a recent major genetic investigation into King Tut's family. The son of Amenhotep III and also the father of Tutankhamun, Akhenaton, (1353-1336 B.C.) is known as the \"heretic\" pharaoh who introduced a monotheistic religion by overthrowing the pantheon of the gods to worship the sun god Aton. The terminal phalanx of his great toe, probably from the left foot, was taken away in 1968, when the Department of Antiquities in Cairo, under the supervision of the then director, handed it over to the late Professor Ronald Harrison of Liverpool University. \"Since then, the specimen has been held securely in my laboratory, but I decided it had to `go home,' particularly since very few people knew where it was,\" Robert Connolly senior lecturer in physical anthropology from the University of Liverpool's Department of Human Anatomy and Cell Biology, told Discovery News. Connolly, who authored several scientific papers with Harrison, used the specimen to determine the blood-group of KV55, then believed to be Smenkharel, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the late 18th Dynasty. \"The remains appeared to be A2 with the antigens M and N present. This was identical to the blood group of Tutankhamun,\" Connolly said.  ...While not a scientific journal, I regard this Discovery News science news report as sufficiently authoritative, especially as it quoted Dr. Connolly's words: \"The remains appeared to be A2 with the antigens M and N present,\" to establish that old blood does not necessarily degrade to AB. Especially bearing in mind that at 14th century BC King Akhenaton's (not Tutankhamun's) remains are much older than the Shroud's presumed 1st century AD.Which means both the Shroud's and the Sudarium of Oviedo's blood group being AB is significant and cannot just be set aside by the claim that old blood always degrades to type AB.

As usual, the “obvious” turns out to be almost the exact opposite. While few (perhaps none) of Stephen Jones’s observations are incontrovertibly incorrect, even fewer (perhaps all) are utterly unchallengeableThey are not MY observations, as though I just made them up off the top of my head. I meticulously referenced each point I made back to the Shroud pro-authenticity literature. And of course, in our postmodern age, ANYTHING can be, and IS, challenged, but that does not thereby make it UNTRUE.There are indeed many problems of understanding how and why the bloodstains appear on the Shroud the way they do, and I don’t pretend to have all the answers. The evidence seems to suggest that the body was washed which moistened the bloodstains and it is that moistened blood which appears on the Shroud, explaining at least partly why earlier bloodstains on the Shroud which would have dried appear to be as fresh as later bloodstains. I will deal with that under section “12.Objections” or “13.Questions.” But it always gets back to the only two reasonable alternatives (see my “1.3 The central dilemma of the Shroud“). Either 1) the Shroud is an incredibly brilliant medieval or earlier FAKE, intended to depict Jesus’ crucified body and blood on it; or 2) the Shroud is AUTHENTIC, the very burial sheet of Jesus, with the image of His body and His blood transferred to it. If the latter alternative is true, as I am persuaded it is, then any problems of how Jesus’ image and blood were transferred to the cloth are merely APPARENT problems. Problems of our limited UNDERSTANDING, not problems in REALITY. After all, we don’t have Roman crucifixion victims and their shrouds available today to scientically study, let alone RESURRECTED ones! And as my posts say, I am collecting one by one the problems of the only reasonable alternative: the medieval or earlier forgery theory, to be brought together and discussed in  section “9.

But as Lavoie showed, and Adler agreed with, the bloodstains which appear to be in the Man’s hair alongside His face and temples were actually on the sides of His face and temples. That is, those bloodstains and image are out of stereoregister. So looking at an image under those bloodstains is looking at the wrong place.This is explained by John Jackson’s Cloth Collapse Theory, as being due to the Shroud around Jesus’ head flattening out as it fell into the source of radiation where Jesus’ resurrected body had been. Note that Lavoie arrived at his conclusion by experimenting with a cloth around a man’s head with imitation bloodstains copied from the Shroud and daubed on it. It was unexpected by him and he was not trying to make his facts fit Jackson’s theory. In fact he made his discovery in 1983, eight years before Jackson proposed his theory.

We have such an abundance of evidence that the Shroud existed many centuries before the “mediaeval … AD 1260-1390” C14 date, that if the Shroud was redated and it still came out medieval it would only confirm that there was something fundamentally wrong with dating ancient burial shrouds in general and a Shroud whose former occupant, Jesus, was resurrected in particular. Because even if the Shroud is authentic, it is likely that a new C14 dating would yield a date somewhere between AD30 and 1350, due to the combined factors of younger carbon having become an integral part of the fabric and therefore unable to be removed by pretreatment, and radiation emitted as a byproduct of Jesus’ resurrection when His body changed state (1Cor 15:50-52; Php 3:21), a new C14 dating would probably satisfy no one. Pro-authenticists would point to how close the date was to the 1st century and anti-authenticists would point to how close the date was to the 14th century!And from the Vatican’s perspective what would be in it for them? Have their priceless relic further “cut up” (to use Colin’s term for his excuse why no museum would supply a postage stamp sized sample of medieval 3:1 herringbone twill visually identical to the Shroud as a control in the 1988 dating) and then endure decades of controversy in its aftermath, not to mention in its planning. As cardinals and bishops they no doubt already have a very busy day job: administering a church, than to spend it pandering to the whims of scientific types who blew their first attempt at C14 dating in 1988 and now wanted another one. Remember that the current Pope Benedict XVI, as Cardinal Ratzinger, was Chair of the Pontifical Academy of Science over the time of the 1988 C14 dating, and so he has an unparalleled understanding of the issues.As a Christian who believes in the Shroud’s authenticity and the Biblical teaching on the sovereignty of God, I believe that the 1988 C14 dating fiasco was no accident. Quite clearly if the Shroud is authentic (as the preponderance of the evidence overwhelmingly points to); and God wanted the 1988 C14 dating to come out as 1st century AD to accurately reflect that fact; which to many, if not most, uncommitted people would prove that Jesus did really exist and really was crowned with thorns, flogged, crucified, died, was entombed and resurrected, as the Gospels attest; then God could have made sure that no human incompetence, prejudice or schemes would have prevented that happening.But as Pascal in the 17th century observed, God seems to have arranged it so that (paraphrased): 1) there is enough evidence for a Christian to have reasonable grounds for his/her faith; and 2) for a non-Christian to have no excuse for his/her unbelief; but 3) there is not enough evidence to force a non-Christian to believe in Christ against his/her will.Stephen E.

Then followed one of the controls. Each run consisted of a 10 second measurement of the carbon-13 current and a 50 second measurement of the carbon-14 counts. This is repeated nine more times and an average carbon-14/carbon-13 ratio calculated. All this was UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL and the CALCULATIONS PRODUCED BY THE COMPUTER were displayed on a cathode ray screen.” (Gove, H.E., 1996, “Relic, Icon or Hoax?: Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud,” p.264).Nor according to Sox’s 1988 account, evidently obtained from Gove, since Sox wasn’t there:“The CALCULATIONS WERE PRODUCED ON THE COMPUTER, AND DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN. Even the dendrochronological correction was immediately available. All eyes were on the screen. The date would be when the flax used for the linen relic was harvested. Gove would be taking cowboy boots back to Rochester.” (Sox, H.D., 1988, “The Shroud Unmasked,” p.147).Even in 1988 a computer was a COMPUTER, not a calculator. I bought my first personal computer in 1980 and it was called a COMPUTER even then, not a calculator.Despite the ad hominem personal attacks: “obsession…. hardened conspiracy theorists … fanaticism” of Hugh, I stand by my PROPOSAL that the three AMS radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker, who either remotely via Arpanet, or manually at each laboratory, inserted a program into each of the lab’s COMPUTERS, which received the uncalibrated radiocarbon dates from their AMS radiocarbon dating machines and displayed them upon each of their screens. The inserted program replaced the Shroud’s first century (or early) C-14 dates coming from the labs’ AMS machines with random dates which clustered around 1325, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s. I realise that my proposal is unnecessary for those, like Hugh, who believe (against all the other evidence) that the Shroud is a 14th century fake. But I note that none of those who believe the Shroud to be authentic attempt to explain how the Shroud can be 1st century, yet radiocarbon date to 1325 +/- 65. And indeed the very first run of C-14 dates of the Shroud, displayed on Arizona lab’s computer screen, was “1350 AD … the time its historic record began”:“The age of the control sample could have been calculated on a small pocket calculator but was not-everyone was waiting for the next sample-the Shroud of Turin! At 9:50 am 6 May 1988, Arizona time, the first of the ten measurements appeared on the screen. We all waited breathlessly. The ratio was compared with the OX sample and the radiocarbon time scale calibration was applied by Doug Donahue. His face became instantly drawn and pale. At the end of that one minute we knew the age of the Turin Shroud! The next nine numbers confirmed the first. It had taken me eleven years to arrange for a measurement that took only ten minutes to accomplish! Based on these 10 one minute runs, with the calibration correction applied, THE YEAR THE FLAX HAD BEEN HARVESTED THAT FORMED ITS LINEN THREADS WAS 1350 AD-the shroud was only 640 years old! It was certainly not Christ’s burial cloth but DATED FROM THE TIME ITS HISTORIC RECORD BEGAN.” (Gove, 1996, p.264).What is the likelihood of that? It means the Shroud would have had to be harvested, woven into linen, and the the Shroud’s image added, all in less than 5-10 years. And while the Shroud was owned by the noblest Christian knight in France, Geoffroi de Charny (c.1300-1356).Even on Benford & Marino’s theory that the Shroud sample was a mixture of 1st century original linen and 16th century repairs, it would be an AMAZING COINCIDENCE (absent some degree of fraud, i.e. ” making results appear just a little crisper or more definitive than they really are, or selecting just the `best’ data for publication and ignoring those that don’t fit” – Broad & Wade) that the Shroud `just happened’ to C-14 date to just before the Shroud first appeared in undisputed history in c. 1355.I note in passing the inconsistency (to put it mildly) of Dan who was worried that the Shroud.com could be hacked by a bogus technician:“Barrie Schwortz’ shroud.com is an irreplaceable treasure. Could it disappear tomorrow because of hackers? It deals with a highly controversial topic that is unavoidably an affront to atheists and many religious people. As such it is a natural target for idealists or extremists of all kinds and particularly a group of hackers who call themselves “Anonymous.” They could probably take down the website in a few minutes. Would they also destroy backup copies of the website’s contents? … How much damage could someone posing as Barrie do? I imagine it would be 100%. Only files stored on third party systems or on dismounted DVD media would be safe. And how much damage could someone posing as a technician of the hosting company do in just a few minutes? Just as much.” (“They don’t do it just for the credit card numbers,” January 9, 2014).If “shroud.com is an … an affront to atheists” and so “a natural target for idealists or extremists of all kinds” then why was the 1988 C-14 dating of the Shroud ITSELF not “an affront to atheists,” and “a natural target for” the KGB?And if in this day and age, a quarter of a century later, when we are much more conscious of computer security than they were in the 1980s, a hacker “posing as a technician of the hosting company” for Shroud.com could “in just a few minutes” destroy Shroud.com, yet in 1988, a  hacker “posing as a technician of the” AMS C-14 dating system company” could not insert a program in the AMS C-14 dating system at each lab, which would replace the Shroud’s dates with 1325 +/- 65 dates? Isn’t groupthink interesting? Andy, who “As an IT guy” found my proposal “preposterous” apparently did not find Dan’s proposal also “preposterous”!I thank the lone commenter Dover who had the courage to swim against the tide of groupthink on Dan’s blog, for at least applauding me “for intellectual imagination and creativity in trying to find solutions.”","date":"March 10, 2014 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">I have recently received an email from Prof. Christopher Ramsey of the Oxford Radiocarbon Laboratory regarding the hacking hypothesis. The text in its entirety runs:“Yes – I agree with all that Tim says. This would seem to be a suggestion from someone who does not know what computers were like in the 1980s.No. I was one of the first to have a personal computer in 1980, I pioneered the introduction of computers into Health Department of WA hospital computers in the mid-to late 1980s and in the late 1980s/early 1990s,I was the Systems Administrator of a network of 7 hospitals UNIX systems.And also I have read Stoll’s 1989 book, “The Cuckoo’s Egg” which relates how easy it was to hack into university computers in the 1980s. >In the case of Oxford the AMS had no connection to any network (and indeed even today our AMS control computers have no network connections). Thanks to Prof. Ramsey for this unambiguous statement. >The software was very simple just outputting counts of 14C and currents measured. Age calculation was done offline and could just be done with a calculator, or by a simple program into which you typed the numbers from the AMS.”Nevertheless, it WAS “software” on each lab’s AMS control computer, which outputted “counts of 14C” which were, according to Gove’s eyewitness account, displayed on the AMS control computer’s screen:“The first sample run was OX1. Then followed one of the controls. Each run consisted of a 10 second measurement of the carbon-13 current and a 50 second measurement of the carbon-14 counts. This is repeated nine more times and an average carbon-14/carbon-13 ratio calculated. All this was under computer control and THE CALCULATIONS PRODUCED BY THE COMPUTER WERE DISPLAYED ON A CATHODE RAY SCREEN. The age of the control sample could have been calculated on a small pocket calculator but was not-everyone was waiting for the next sample-the Shroud of Turin! At 9:50 am 6 May 1988, Arizona time, the first of the ten measurements appeared on the screen. We all waited breathlessly. The ratio was compared with the OX sample and the radiocarbon time scale calibration was applied by Doug Donahue. His face became instantly drawn and pale.

It had taken me eleven years to arrange for a measurement that took only ten minutes to accomplish! Based on these 10 one minute runs, with the calibration correction applied, the year the flax had been harvested that formed its linen threads was 1350 AD-the shroud was only 640 years old! It was certainly not Christ’s burial cloth but dated from the time its historic record began.” (Gove, H.E., 1996, “Relic, Icon or Hoax?: Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud,” p.264).It is those calculations which when calibrated, yielded a date of “1350 AD”. So all that a hacker would have to do is modify the program which displayed those “counts of 14C” to replace those coming from the Shroud samples with “counts of 14C” which when calibrated, yielded the TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE date of “1350 AD”.>I don’t suppose Stephen Jones will accept this as a sensible rebuttal of his claim, I do accept it as face value as a rebuttal of my original proposal that the hacker logged in remotely via Arpanet. But it is not a rebuttal of my subsequent proposal that a hacker logged into the three C-14 dating laboratories locally, e.g. “posing as a technician” or after hours.>and I’m sorry about that, because his current stance, coupled to his earlier Satanic allegations about Pope Francis, `Poisoning the well’ allegation noted:“Poisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a rhetorical device where adverse information about a target is pre-emptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say…” (Wikipedia)I made NO “Satanic allegations about Pope Francis”. All I wrote in my “2013 Favs: New Tests Date the Shroud from the Time of Christ” post was: “But if the Shroud is a deliberate fraud, then it would almost certainly be a work of Satan, and no Church that calls itself Christian should be promoting a deliberate fraud (much less a work of Satan)!”Note the all-important conditional “IF”. I don’t think that “the Shroud is a deliberate fraud” and my argument is that neither does the Vatican. My point was simply to highlight the inconsistency of the Vatican’s current policy of neither confirming nor denying the Shroud is authentic, yet spending the equivalent of many millions of dollars protecting the Shroud and also of exhibiting it with increasing regularity to millions of people.>render his absolutist convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud, which I originally found quite noble (albeit wrong), utterly worthless.Another attempt to `poison the well’ by Prof. Ramsey. I don’t have “absolutist convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud,” As my blog’s masthead states: “I am PERSUADED BY THE EVIDENCE that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Jesus Christ and bears His crucified and resurrected image.” On a previous post several years ago, I wrote something like: `I was a Christian for nearly 40 years before I became persuaded by the evidence that the Shroud is authentic. And if it were proven to be false, I would still be the same Christian that I was before I accepted that the Shroud was authentic.’ And even if my proposal that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker turns out to be wrong, that does not make my other “convictions about the authenticity of the Shroud … utterly worthless.”The Shroud could still be authentic, as all the evidence except for the C-14 date of 1325 +/- 65 years indicates, and only my above proposal be wrong.But then there still would be the problem of explaining how the Shroud could be 1st century, yet its C-14 date is 1325 +/- 65 years, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s. As the agnostic art historian Thomas de Wesselow pointed out:“One important consideration weighs in favour of the possibility of deception. If the carbon-dating error was accidental, then IT IS A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE that the result tallies so well with the date always claimed … as the Shroud’s historical debut. But if fraud was involved, then it wouldn’t be a coincidence at all. Had anyone wished to discredit the Shroud, ‘1325 ± 65 years’ is precisely the sort of date they would have looked to achieve.” e Wesselow, T., 2012, “The Sign: The Shroud of Turin and the Secret of the Resurrection,”, p.170. My emphasis).Indeed, I find it strange that a scientist of Prof. Ramsey’s eminence would even THINK, let alone say, such an illogical thing. That if I am wrong on ONE THING in favour of the Shroud’s authenticity, then EVERYTHING ELSE I say in defense of the Shroud’s authenticity is “utterly worthless.”Prof. Ramsey seems very keen to `poison the well’ against me personally, so no one will take any notice of what I say. That suggests, to me at least, that maybe Prof. Ramsey has something to hide in respect of my proposal that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker?","date":"March 11, 2014 at 12:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">I find the idea of a Soviet hacker preposterous and conspiratorial, and the continued attempt to defend it obsessive.As I wrote: “I realise that my proposal is unnecessary for those, like Hugh, who believe (against all the other evidence) that the Shroud is a 14th century fake.”That is, it is only a problem of explaining why the Shroud is 1st century, yet has a 1325 C-14 date, to those who on the basis of all the other evidence, are persuaded that the Shroud is authentic and so is 1st century. But Hugh and his anti-authenticist ilk have the FAR GREATER PROBLEM of proposing a comprehensive and coherent forgery theory which: 1) negatively, plausibly explains away all the evidence that the Shroud is authentic; and 2) positively plausibly explains how the Shroud was faked, who faked it, when it was faked and why it was faked. That there is no such comprehensive and coherent forgery theory of the Shroud on the table shows that such a theory, if it had ever been attempted, was found to have so many holes that it was quietly shelved.So all that the Shroud anti-authenticists like Hugh can do is snipe away at Shroud pro-authenticists (like me), including `poisoning of the well’ character assassinations, as we attempt to strengthen our comprehensive and coherent Shroud pro-authenticist theory. But to paraphrase Alfred Lord Tennyson, in science, “‘Tis better to have theorised and lost than never to have theorised at all.” At least my theory is FALSIFIABLE and so could yet be proven wrong. But Hugh’s NON-theory, as it presently stands, is “not EVEN wrong”! I note that no one has responded to the points I made above, but instead they have repeated ad hominems and/or changed the subject. Therefore I regard my `the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker’ proposal as to date unrefuted. I meant to thank Dan for his: “shroud.com [sic] is … an affront to atheists and .. As such it is a natural target for idealists or extremists of all kinds.” And also for his scenario of “someone posing as a technician” obtaining access to the computer where Shroud.com’s is hosted and backed up, and destroying it “100%”. So if that is true of a Shroud WEBSITE, how much more is it true of the Shroud ITSELF? That is, even if it wasn’t the KGB, on Dan’s own reasoning there would have been “ATHEISTS” and “idealists or extremists OF ALL KINDS” to whom a C-14 dating of the Shroud to the 1st, or an early, century, would be “a NATURAL TARGET”.And in 1988 at a university, it wouldn’t even have to be “someone posing as a technician.” As Stoll (who did his PhD at the University of Arizona) wrote in 1989:“Every few months, I’d hear a rumour about someone else’s system being invaded; usually this was at universities, and it was often blamed on students or teenagers. … Sure, it’s EASY TO MUCK AROUND COMPUTERS AT UNIVERSITIES where NO SECURITY WAS NEEDED. After all, colleges SELDOM EVEN LOCK THE DOORS TO THEIR BUILDINGS.” (Stoll, C., 1989, “The Cuckoo’s Egg,” p.12).So, applying what Stoll wrote to the Arizona, Zurich and Oxford universities’ radiocarbon labs in 1988, it would be “easy” to hack into their AMS C-14 dating computers because back then “no security was needed” and the labs may not have even bothered to “lock the doors to their buildings.”","date":"March 11, 2014 at 9:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"No, Jull’s email does NOT refute my hacking hypothesis, First, it is clear from my quote of Gove, the final calibration was done offline by Donahue: “The ratio was compared with the OX sample and THE RADIOCARBON TIME SCALE CALIBRATION WAS APPLIED BY DOUG DONAHUE.”But it was the computer at the end of the AMS C-14 dating system that supplied the “OX sample”‘s raw years which Donahue calibrated.I allowed for that: “… a KGB agent hacked into the AMS system control console computer at each of the three C-14 labs and inserted a program which, when each test was run, replaced the Shroud’s 1st or early century c-14 date, WITH DATES WHICH WHEN CALIBRATED, would yield years clustering around AD 1325, just before the Shroud’s appearance in undisputed history in the 1350s.” Second, Jull’s “…in 1988 the internet (as we know it today) didn’t exist – there was a pre-existing network run by the US government which was quite restricted.” I did not say it was the “Internet”. What I said was: “… in the 1980s university computers were all interconnected by ARPANET, THE PRECURSOR TO THE INTERNET …”. Jull’s “quite restricted” does not mention that Arpanet was originally restricted but was expanded to universities, and in particular to “research laboratories in the US:“ARPANET … was one of the world’s first operational packet switching networks, the first network to implement TCP/IP, and the progenitor of what was to become the global Internet. The network was initially funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) within the U.S. Department of Defense for use by its projects at universities and RESEARCH LABORATORIES IN THE US.” (Wikipedia)A Google search of “Arpanet” and “University of Arizona” shows that Arpanet was at the University of Arizona by 1984. Jull’s “Anyway, the machine we used at that time couldn’t have been attached to it, and that one still isn’t”, is ambiguous. If he means by “machine” the AMS machine itself, I don’t claim that machine was attached to Arpanet. But if Jull means by “machine” the COMPUTER which processed the data coming from the AMS machine, then I doubt that is true, although Jull may believe it to be true. Stoll’s book makes clear that all university computers in the 1980s were connectable to Arpanet, and most were, especially laboratories.But if it can be proven that Arizona, Zurich and Oxford’s AMS control console computers were not ever connected to Arpanet, then that does not mean that a hacker could not have inserted a program into those computers, as he could have done it manually. Stoll’s book (and he did his PhD at the University of Arizona) makes it clear that physical security at universities in the 1980s was also poor. You and your commenters may scoff at the idea that the KGB would have as one of its goals to discredit the Shroud, but you fail to consider what a perceived threat it would be to the Soviet Union if the Shroud was dated to the first or early centuries.Dan, your commenters, and you, can try to denigrate me personally by calling my proposal a “conspiracy theory” with all its negative connotations. The One whose image is on the Shroud will be my and their Judge (Mt 16:27; 25:31-32; Ac 10:42; 2Cor 5:10; 2Tim 4:1, 1Pet 4:5). But they, and you, are not facing up to the fact that if the Shroud is authentic (as all the evidence apart from the C-14 dating indicates), then it would be “a remarkable coincidence” (to put it mildly) that its C-14 date was 1325 +/- 65 years, just before “the Shroud’s historical debut”, as the agnostic Thomas de Wesselow saw clearly:“One important consideration weighs in favour of the possibility of deception. If the carbon-dating error was accidental, then it is A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE that the result tallies so well with the date [of] … the Shroud’s historical debut. But IF FRAUD WAS INVOLVED, THEN IT WOULDN’T BE A COINCIDENCE AT ALL. Had anyone wished to discredit the Shroud, ‘1325 ± 65 years’ is precisely the sort of date they would have looked to achieve.” (de Wesselow, T., 2012, “The Sign: The Shroud of Turin and the Secret of the Resurrection,” p.170).My bottom line is that, since the Shroud IS authentic, there HAD to be some form of fraud to convert a 1st century actual date of the Shroud into the too good to be true 1325 ± 65 years date. Harry Grove’s worries before the test that at least one of the AMS labs would return an outlier date, and the 1989 Intercomparison Test in which the AMS labs fared badly, makes it difficult to believe (again to put it mildly) that all three AMS labs independently dated the Shroud “flawlessly,” as Gove later assumed they would have to have done, to date the Shroud so accurately, to within 25-30 years of the Shroud’s appearance at Lirey in the 1350s.My proposal that the labs were duped by a computer hacker fits all the facts (Jull’s ambiguous email notwithstanding), and it allows for Ian Wilson’s assurance that the lab leaders were basically honest.

A belated thanks to EGM for his support.It is a stereotypical myth of science, that it is “backward science” to “start with the conclusion and end up with the hypothesis”. Science in fact DOES start from a previous conclusion, and proposes new hypotheses based on that conclusion. >Then you can move to the next level after arriving at the Shroud’s authenticity and attempt to explore how widespread the fraud really is which some don’t want to be discussed it seems. Yes, slogans like “conspiracy theory” are excuses not to think about the problem: if the Shroud is 1st century, then why did it date to 1325, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s?>It’s naturally going to lead into colluding elements if that’s what really happened, possibly strange bed fellows as well, that’s human nature I’m afraid, My `the C-14 labs were duped by a computer hacker’ proposal is an attempt to explain how there could have been fraud, yet the lab leaders were basically honest. If Hugh and his ilk could remove the naturalistic scales from their eyes they would see I am not a conspiracy theorist, because the latter all to date have accused the laboratories leaders of outright fraud in switching samples, etc.The worst that I have in the past proposed is that the C-14 labs were guilty of “making results appear just a little crisper or more definitive than they really are, or selecting just the `best’ data for publication and ignoring those that don’t fit” which respected science journalists Broad and Wade state is “probably far from unusual in science” (Broad, W.A. & Wade, N.J., 1982, “Betrayers of the Truth: Fraud andDeceit in the Halls of Science,”  p.20).My new theory is an attempt to explore a way that the labs could be basically honest, yet a fraud did occur, not by the labs but by a computer hacker. If it was confirmed to be what happened, then it would make the laboratories look GULLIBLE, but they would not then be guilty of fraud..   >you don’t get to claim it debunked just because it sounds strange, absurd, ridiculous, etc to your (hopefully not closed) mind. Reality is absurd and ridiculous and over the top sometimes. Agreed. But it is not even “absurd and ridiculous and over the top” that the Arizona, Zurich and Oxford’s C-14 lab’s computers were hacked into in 1988. The fact is that university computers DID get hacked back in the 1980s. The hacker that Stoll caught DID hack into Berkeley University Livermore Lab’s computer system, so he could from that system hack into about 400 MILITARY computers which were more secure than university computers, the latter which, as Stoll records, were not very secure at all.>If hacking the labs is really so off base as some would like to paint it, then it should easily be debunked with verified facts and the world will continue. Yes. I found Jull’s email curiously ambiguous, and indeed FALSE:>>This is impossible. In our case, the software for the calculations is offline. In any case, the calculation does NOT require software, it was done offline and plotted on a graph, as I recall.But Gove and Sox’s accounts show that the results were displayed on Arizona’s AMS computer’ screen, and it was evident from that screen that the Shroud was not first century, even thought the years on the screen needed to be calibrated.>>Indeed, in 1988 the internet (as we know it today) didn’t exist – there was a pre-existing network run by the US government which was quite restricted.This is disingenuous. Jull must know that by 1988 Arpanet connected most USA universities, and in particular their research laboratories. >>Anyway, the machine we used at that time couldn’t have been attached to it, and that one still isn’t.”. Again ambiguity by Jull. Is “machine” the AMS system or the COMPUTER receiving C-14 dating data from the AMS system and via a program displaying that C-14 data’s uncalibrated dates?If the AMS machines COMPUTER was connected to Arpanet, would Jull be aware of it? It would be convenient for the company which supplied the AMS system to be able to log into the AMS system’s comouter via Arpanet and update its software.But, as I previously wrote, if it could be proved (and I mean independently of the C-14 labs) that the AMS system computers at the three C-14 labs were not online, nevertheless they were still computers which were operated by a program, which in turn could be hacked locally, e.g. by “someone posing as a technician”.>So far there seems to be only more questions raised and clarifications needed from the responses from representatives of two of the three labs involved in the 1988 C14 tests.Agreed. But of course if it has just now dawned on the labs, after all these years, that they may have been the victim of a hacking, in such an important  C-14 dating as that of the Shroud, they would hardly be likely to welcome investigations into it. Rather they would be defensive as Jull’s email seems to be.  I thank Dan for his “Comment Promoted: On the Hacking Hypothesis.” And to Hugh for contacting Jull. No doubt they both thought “this [would] put an end to it, once and for all” but the genie of my proposal is now, thanks to them, out of the bottle.And as my replies have shown, it is not as simple as they thought, to dismiss my proposal by ad hominems and half-truths. .","date":"March 11, 2014 at 11:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/09/comment-promoted-on-the-hacking-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  On the Hacking Hypothesis"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"DanThanks again for the free publicity!Whether you believe it or not, the labs being duped by a computer hacker was going to be one of the fraud possibilities in my series that I terminated because I realised it was going to take too much time to address all fraud possibilities.It is you and some of your readers who seem to have jumped to the conclusion that fraud can only mean by the laboratories’ leadership. I have been thinking of the laboratories being duped by a hacker possibility since at least 2007. I regard that as a type of fraud.And, as you will see, computer hacking by a laboratory insider (or insiders) is a real possibility, which would be a type of fraud by the laboratories, but not necessarily by one of their leadership. And even if the labs were duped by a hacker, there still could have (and probably would have) been low-level fraud that Broad and Wade refer to in “making results appear just a little crisper or more definitive than they really are, or selecting just the `best’ data for publication and ignoring those that don’t fit”:“The term `scientific fraud’ is often assumed to mean the wholesale invention of data. But this is almost certainly the rarest kind of fabrication. Those who falsify scientific data probably start and succeed with the much lesser crime of improving upon existing results. Minor and seemingly trivial instances of data manipulation-such as making results appear just a little crisper or more definitive than they really are, or selecting just the `best’ data for publication and ignoring those that don’t fit the case-are probably far from unusual in science. But there is only a difference in degree between `cooking’ the data and inventing a whole experiment out of thin air.” (Broad, W.A. & Wade, N.J., 1982, “Betrayers of the Truth: Fraud and Deceit in the Halls of Science,” Simon and Schuster: New York NY, p.20).Which has always been my MINIMUM claim.PS: It’s strange you didn’t find “Arizona” in your Kindle version of Stoll’s book. In my paper version, opposite the title, it says:“Clifford Stoll is an astronomer by training and a computer security expert by accident. He received his Ph.D. from the UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA in 1980 and has since then worked as an astronomer, scientific programmer and computer systems manager in various observatories and laboratories.” (my emphasis).Though it is not my claim that Stoll mentions radiocarbon dating or the Shroud (I read the book years before I became interested in the Shroud), it is a bonus for me that Stoll received his PhD from Arizona, as you will see.Stephen E.

So Ramsey puts out what looks like disinfo on a crucial question regarding how/if the numbers could have been fudged in the C14 tests (whether intentionally or it was just a ‘senior moment’ you can decide) — thus appearing to discredit himself Prof. Ramsey’s claim that I was “someone who does not know what computers were like in the 1980s.”:>>Yes – I agree with all that Tim says. This would seem to be a suggestion from someone who does not know what computers were like in the 1980s.”is not only FALSE, I know from PERSONAL EXPERIENCE what computers were like in the 1980s.But also it is MISLEADING in the light of Prof. Ramsey’s next paragraph:>>In the case of Oxford the AMS had no connection to any network (and indeed even today our AMS control computers have no network connections). The software was very simple just outputting counts of 14C and currents measured. Age calculation was done offline and could just be done with a calculator, or by a simple program into which you typed the numbers from the AMS.”This could  be taken to mean that the AMS control console computer was little more than a calculator. In fact, based on it, Dan questioned whether it was even “programmable”. But in fact it now appears that the AMS control console computer was a “DEC computer system,” either a PDP or a VAX. In which case it would have been a mini-computer, i.e. a mini-MAINFRAME-computer, far more powerful than personal computers were until a decade later.Given that Prof. Ramsey must know that, his attack on me seems strange for an Oxford Professor, let alone that it was FALSE and MISLEADING.Therefore it seems to me, at least, to be a case of “protesting too much”. That is, I suspect that Prof. Ramsey may know, or suspect, that the C-14 labs were, or could have been, hacked and therefore their 1260-1390 date of the Shroud was, or could have been, a fraud, perpetrated on them. The 1989 suicide of Timothy Linick may have alerted them to that possibility, or even actuality.  >— yet Stephen Jones is the one looked askance at and receiving cheap pot shots for pointing it out and daring to pursue the important questions!

Linick’s death was “suicide in mysterious circumstances”:“Another episode was disturbing , June 4, 1989 , suicide in mysterious circumstances by Timothy W. Linick , a scholar of the method of the mass spectrometer .” (Giacomo Galeazzi,“Never solved the enigma that still divides the Church,” Vatican Insider, Apr 1, 2013. Translated from Italian by Google).Also there is an Italian Wikipedia page (translated by Google) which says that others have theorised that Linick “could have been killed … to avoid…” him confessing “… the alleged fraud”:“The “conspiracy theorists” have also raised doubts about the death of Timothy Linick, forty-collaborator of the Tucson laboratory and co-signer of the Nature, who died June 4, 1989 by suicide, according to this theory, could have been killed instead, to avoid prove that the alleged fraud. [citation needed]” (“Examination of the carbon-14 on the Shroud,” Wikipedia, January 4, 2014).In the context this was about the `conspiracy theory’ that “Michael Tite [of the British  Museum] and at least one person for each of the three laboratories” were involved in a switching of Shroud samples fraud. I do NOT believe that.And again I do NOT claim that Linick WAS a hacker and that his death WAS suicide, However, I can’t help thinking that the execution made to look like suicide of hacker Karl Koch, who had worked for the KGB, on 23 May 1989, and then the “suicide in mysterious circumstances” of Arizona lab’s Timothy W. Linick, less than 2 weeks later on 4 June 1989, only a few months after the 16 February 1989 Nature paper claimed the Shroud was dated “AD 1260-1390”, MAY have been linked.Significantly, that each of the three AMS  laboratories used the same procedures for measuring the C-14 in their samples, under the control of their AMS control console computers, is stated in the 1989 Nature paper:“The specific measurement procedures for each laboratory are given by Linick et al. 9 … 9. Linick, T. W., Jull, A. J. T., Toolin, L. J. & Donahue, D. J. Radiocarbon 28, 522-533 (1986). That is the paper I cited in my previous comment, “Linick, T.W., et al. 1986, “Operation of the NSF-Arizona accelerator facility for radioisotope analysis and results from selected collaborative research projects,” Radiocarbon, Vol. 28, No. 2a, pp.522-533).”As can be seen, Linick was the lead author of that paper and therefore it is likely that he wrote the AMS control console computer program for it, given that he was “extremely mathematically gifted,” according to his obituary in Radiocarbon. And if the program was written in assembly language (see above) that would make it more likely that the program was opaque to the other lab staff, in Arizona and the other two labs.So Linick (if he was the hacker) could have modified the Arizona lab’s program to replace the Shroud C-14 dates with dates clustering around 1325, and he could also have sent both Zurich and Oxford C-14 labs his modified program as an `update’ of their program, which he had himself written.Admittedly this is necessarily speculative at this stage and again I do NOT claim that Linick WAS a hacker and that his death WAS suicide.","date":"April 1, 2014 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/01/developing-a-hacking-theory/","cat":"hacking","title":"Developing a Hacking Theory"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">You have to admire Stephen’s persistence, don’t you? I am persistent because I believe that I am on the right track. And because I am facing up to the key issue: if the Shroud is authentic (which Hugh doesn’t believe), then how did its linen, being first century or earlier, `just happen’ to have a C-14 date the midpoint of which is 1325, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s?Indeed Arizona’s date WAS “1350 AD …the time its historic record began”: “Based on these 10 one minute runs, with the calibration correction applied, the year the flax had been harvested that formed its linen threads was 1350 AD-the shroud was only 640 years old! It was certainly not Christ’s burial cloth but dated from the time its historic record began.” (Gove, H.E., 1996, “Relic, Icon or Hoax?: Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud,”  p.264)which is just too good to be true and should have rung alarm bells in the minds of normally sceptical scientists that something was wrong. But they all accepted that `bull’s eye’ date  uncritically, even those who had believed that the Shroud was authentic.>I suppose his crucial question is now: How was his computer programmed? Punched cards? Roll of of punched paper? Magnetic tape? Or did the programme have to be typed in?If the AMS control console computer was a DEC VAX-11, as per my previous comment under Dan’s post that he has provided a link to above, then it supported a variety of computer languages, including “assembly language“:“The VAX-11/780 introduced on October 25, 1977 was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing that architecture. … The VAX instruction set was designed to be powerful and orthogonal…. When it was introduced, many programs were written in assembly language, so having a “programmer-friendly” instruction set was important…. In time, as more programs were written in higher-level language, the instruction set became less visible, and the only ones much concerned about it were compiler writers.” (“VAX,” Wikipedia).I would not be surprised if the AMS control console computer program was written in assembly language, because of its power and flexibility in controlling machines, albeit at the cost of difficulty of programming it it. But that would be no problem for a hacker.

But where those who pointed that out went wrong is that they considered only ONE form of fraud, sample-switching, which is highly implausible; and did not consider a much more likely form of fraud for the FULLY COMPUTERISED process of AMS radiocarbon dating, namely COMPUTER HACKING.[continued]","date":"June 8, 2015 at 9:56 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/12/my-theory-that-radiocarbon-dating_8.html","title":"My theory that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker #10: Summary (2)"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]Even though Gove's book was not available until 1996, which stated that the AMS radiocarbon dating process was FULLY COMPUTERISED:\"The first sample run was OX1. Then followed one of the controls. Each run consisted of a 10 second measurement of the carbon-13 current and a 50 second measurement of the carbon-14 counts. This is repeated nine more times and an average carbon-14/carbon-13 ratio calculated. ALL THIS WAS UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL and the CALCULATIONS PRODUCED BY THE COMPUTER were displayed on a cathode ray screen.\" (Gove, H.E., 1996, \"Relic, Icon or Hoax?,\" p.264. My emphasis);Sox's book stated it in 1988:\"The CALCULATIONS WERE PRODUCED ON THE COMPUTER, and DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN. Even the dendrochronological correction was immediately available. All eyes were on the screen. The date would be when the flax used for the linen relic was harvested.\" (Sox, H.D., 1988, \"The Shroud Unmasked,\" p.147).So there really was NO EXCUSE for those who correctly realised that there HAD to have been fraud in the 1st century Shroud having a 13th/14th century radiocarbon date, not considering computer hacking as another form of fraud.Although they mean well, like police investigators who focus only on the wrong suspect in a crime, and ignore other suspects, one of whom actually did the crime, those who claim the fraud was sample switching are unwittingly protecting the actual perpetrator, a computer hacker (allegedly Timothy W. Linick).>And the fact that there is a mismatch in the reported weights and sizes of the samples provides support to his accusationThe photograph of the various Shroud radiocarbon dating samples in Wilson's 2010 book, \"The Shroud,\" which is online, shows that there is no \"mismatch in the reported ... sizes of the samples.\" So any \"mismatch in the reported weights ... of the samples\" is readily explained by human error.Stephen E.

I will leave it to the Lord to repay (Rom 12:19) Porter and his ilk for the personal attacks and nastiness that they have directed at me.>Its very interesting that Koch and Linick were both dead within so close time intervals of each other. Yes. I initially thought that my theory was weakened when I re-calculated that Koch was killed sometime between 23 and 30 May 1989 (since Koch went missing on 23 May and a farmer called the police after he noticed Koch's car abandoned three days in a row), which was between 12 and 6 days before Linick's `suicide.' But then I remembered that the police would havehad  to formally identify the charred body as Koch's:\"The body was LATER IDENTIFIED as that of the twenty-four-year-old Karl Koch.\" (Clough, B. & Mungo, P., 1992, \"Approaching Zero,\" p.163. My emphasis).before they could release the news to the public, which would presumably take at least a few days.So the KGB would probably not have known that Koch's body, which they had tried to hide so it would not be found for a long while:\"Koch left his workplace in his car to go for lunch; he had not returned by late afternoon and so his employer reported him as a missing person. Meanwhile, German police were alerted of an abandoned car in a forest near Celle. When they went to investigate, they found an abandoned car, that LOOKED LIKE IT HAD BEEN THERE FOR YEARS, AS IT WAS COVERED IN DUST. Near to the car they found a burned corpse (Koch). His shoes were missing and have never been found. There was a patch of burned ground around him, which although it had not rained in some time and the grass was perfectly dry, was controlled in a small circle around the corpse. It is thought to be highly unlikely that this type of controlled burning could have been achieved by Koch himself which leads many to believe that his death was not suicide.\" (\"Karl Koch (hacker),\" Wikipedia, 30 May 2014. My emphasis).had been found until they read, or heard it, via the news media. And then it was BIG news:\"The news of Hagbard's [Koch's] death brought the case of the hacker spies once again into public view. West German magazines and newspapers carried lengthy, speculative articles about the death. Just how sensitive was the material that landed in the hands of the KGB? And just who might have had an interest in seeing Hagbard dead? Could such a hideously painful death really have been the result of suicide? Unlike a drug overdose or suicide by gunshot, death by burning usually leaves the cause more ambiguous.\" (Hafner, K. & Markoff, J., 1991, \"Cyberpunk,\" pp.302-303).But the police did not find Koch's body until \"NINE days later\" than 23rd May, i.e. 1st June, or it could have been 31st May if the day Koch went missing was included in the 9 days:[continued]","date":"September 6, 2014 at 9:39 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/09/my-theory-that-radiocarbon-dating.html","title":"My theory that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker #9"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]\"Karl Koch was last seen alive on 23 May 1989. That morning he had turned up to work as usual at the Hannover office of Germany's ruling Christian Democratic party. Just before twelve o'clock he drove off alone to deliver a package across town. He never arrived. In the late afternoon, his employers notified the police of his disappearance. NINE DAYS LATER the police went to a wood on the outskirts of the small village of Ohof, just outside Hannover, on a routine inquiry. They were investigating a report of an abandoned car, its roof, hood and windscreen thick with dust. In the undergrowth near the car, the police stumbled on a charred corpse lying next to an empty gasoline can. The vegetation around the body was scorched and burned. The police noticed that the corpse was barefoot - but no shoes were found in the car or in the surrounding area. The investigators were perplexed. There had been no rain for five weeks and the undergrowth was as dry as matchwood. But the scorched patch around the body was contained, as if the fire that consumed the victim had been carefully controlled. The body was later identified as that of the twenty-four-year-old Karl Koch. The police assumed he had committed suicide. But still there were questions: principally, if Koch had killed himself, how had he been able to control the fire? Why had it not spread outside the confined perimeter?\" (Clough & Mungo, 1992, p.163. My emphasis).So, since Linick was found dead of \"suicide in mysterious circumstances\" on 4th June, then that would have been IMMEDIATELY AFTER the KGB learned that Koch's body had been found. >Suicide was the typical liquidation methods of intelligence agencies and they were very good at what they did.Indeed. The coincidence seems too great that a KNOWN hacker for the KGB (Koch) was killed, presumably by the KGB (who else?), for no apparent reason, and then immediately after his body was found, a THEORISED hacker for the KGB (Linick) was found dead of \"suicide in mysterious circumstances.\">Its interesting that not much information can be found on Linick's death.Yes. You would think that the sudden death of a 42 year-old local scientist in Tucson, would at least be mentioned in the local media. But the Library of Congress could only find a death and funeral notice. It is consistent with the US security agencies having suppressed the news. Although it is possible that the suicide was in a category that the media don't report, to avoid copy-cat suicides, like jumping in front of a moving train. Which of course the KGB could have arranged. But when Koch was found dead by simulated suicide presumably the US security agencies took note of it, because Koch had hacked US secrets and sold them to the KGB. Then when Linick committed \"suicide in mysterious circumstances\" only days later, since the Arizona radiocarbon dating laboratory is a US Government funded facility:\"Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory focuses on the study of cosmogenic isotopes, and in particular the study of radiocarbon, or Carbon-14. ...Established in 1981, this facility is a National Science Foundation research facility.\" (\"Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory,\" Wikipedia, 9 August 2012)it is possible that the US security agencies put two and two together, and had the news of Linick's death suppressed on national security grounds.[continued]","date":"September 6, 2014 at 9:46 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/09/my-theory-that-radiocarbon-dating.html","title":"My theory that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker #9"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>Something smells funny here about these 2 deaths.Agreed. Apart from my theory, there is no known reason for Koch's simulated suicide. He had ~9 months before finished confessing his hacking of computer secrets for the KGB and so had his fellow hackers. But none of the latter were killed. Besides, the KGB would not be unduly upset that news of it's sponsored hacking of the computer secrets of OTHERS became known. It would only be the KGB's OWN hacking, e.g. ensuring the C14 dating of the Shroud returned a 1st century date, that the KGB would kill to ensure it remained secret.  What also seemed strange was when Hugh Farey copied my early comments on Porter's blog, proposing that the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud were the result of a computer hacking, to Profs. Timothy Jull and Prof. Christopher Ramsey, Directors of the Arizona and Oxford radiocarbon laboratories respectively, who both were signatories to the 1989 Nature paper, they both responded promptly. I thought that \"smells funny\" because why would they respond AT ALL to an unknown blogger (Farey said he did not tell them my name)?But what also smelled even funnier is that they were both very defensive and Prof. Ramsey effectively LIED, claiming that I was \"someone who does not know what computers were like in the 1980s\":\"This would seem to be a suggestion FROM SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHAT COMPUTERS WERE LIKE IN THE 1980S. In the case of Oxford the AMS had no connection to any network (and indeed even today our AMS control computers have no network connections). The software was very simple just outputting counts of 14C and currents measured. Age calculation was done offline and COULD JUST BE DONE WITH A CALCULATOR, or by a simple program into which you typed the numbers from the AMS\" (my emphasis).when in fact I was there at the beginning of the personal computer revolution of the 1980s and grew with it, becoming a SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATOR of a Health Department of Western Australia wide-area network of 7 hospital UNIX computers in the late 1980s/early 1990s.And besides it MADE NO SENSE because Prof. Ramsey KNEW that the AMS System computer at Arizona, Oxford and presumably Zurich, was a very powerful DEC PDP or VAX MINICOMPUTER. So what was Ramsey's POINT, if it was not to MISLEAD? And mislead it did, with those on Porter's blog interpreting Ramsey's \"The software was very simple ... Age calculation was done offline and could just be done with a calculator,\" as saying that the AMS computer was little better than a calculator, and Porter himself questioned whether it was even programmable!So I assume that Profs Ramsey and Jull know things that would support my hacking theory, but are trying to cover it up. Which is not to say that they KNOW they were hacked. Linick could, and probably did, include in his program that it would erase itself on the three  laboratories AMS computers after it had been run, and then was not run again for (say) three months, when all dating of the Shroud would have finished. But Jull and Ramsey may SUSPECT that they COULD have been hacked, but they wouldn't want that to be known.

Although being a theory, not a fact, I am open to any evidence that might require it to be modified, or even abandoned as wrong (although I think the latter is unlikely).But if I WAS wrong, in Science there is no shame in that, despite what Porter, who has no science qualifications (unlike me) might think. Most scientific theories have been wrong and all science theories are potentially wrong. Scientists ADMIRE (albeit often grudgingly) when someone sticks their neck out and proposes a bold theory which attempts to explain much. What is DESPISED in Science are those who sit on the fence (like Porter) and propose NO bold theories (or even a theory AT ALL) but hold an UNFALSIFIABLE position that is \"not EVEN wrong,\" e.g. \"Is the Shroud of Turin real? Probably\"!But as I have written before, Koch is not essential to my theory, since Linick could have done all the hacking himself. It would not have been too difficult for Linick to take a week off work and fly to Oxford and Zurich and install clandestinely his program on their AMS computers, as he had done on Arizona's (although if Linick did not know how to break into Zurich and Oxfrord's computers, then that would explain Koch's involvement). It is not even essential to my theory that the KGB was involved, as Linick could have done the hacking alone (again assuming that he could break into Zurich and Oxford's AMS computers) for no financial gain but just out of his extreme anti-authenticism. However, I believe that my theory should try to explain as many facts as possible (the mark of a good theory), which is why I have stuck my neck out, giving Porter and anyone else, the opportunity to chop it off!Stephen E.

But I am just plain Mr. Jones.I don’t think we need to be worried about this at all. Apart from it being Jesus’ Shroud, who has all power and authority in heaven and earth (Mt 28:18; Eph 1:21), and who has protected His burial sheet down through the ages as a witness to His suffering, death and resurrection; there is effectively zero probability that the Pope would allow the whole Shroud to be put in a chamber of gas which was then electrically charged up to a plasma state.Perhaps the most important part of the article is Dr Rowe’s statement:“In theory, it could even be used to date the Shroud of Turin.”Because that is a tacit admission of what is probably now widely accepted in the radiocarbon-dating community, that the 1988 carbon-14 dating of the Shroud as “AD 1260-1390 … mediaeval”:“The results of radiocarbon measurements at Arizona, Oxford and Zurich yield a calibrated calendar age range with at least 95% confidence for the linen of the Shroud of Turin of AD 1260 – 1390 (rounded down/up to nearest 10 yr). These results therefore provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval.” (Damon, P.E., et al., “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” Nature, Vol. 337, 16 February, 1989, pp.611-615, p.614).was flawed, otherwise why bother proposing to radiocarbon-date the Shroud again?Stephen","date":"March 30, 2010 at 6:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/24/new-dating-technique-might-help-with-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New dating technique might help with the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"DanFor some reason I get everyone else’s comments emailed to me, but not my own.

But the fact is that Vatican never \"announced the shroud to be a 14 century forgery.\" As I pointed out in a recent post, \"Shroud of Turin may not be a fake after all! \", that was the invention of the British media.>it is important to know that the carbon dating was correct but carried out on samples which were not from the original cloth. If this is claiming that \"the carbon dating was correct\" then I don't necessarily agree that it was. It is very difficult to radiocarbon-date old linen, especially when it has wrapped a body, due to flax fibres being highly porous and comprised of microfibrils arranged in a rope-like spiral, giving it an enormous surface area that can absorb and retain younger carbon and then resist it being removed.As for \"carried out on samples which were not from the original cloth,\" this could be either from a fraudulent switch of a 14th century linen sample for the Shroud; or from the sample being from a re-woven patch of the Shroud. There is some evidence for both theories, but I am not yet convinced of either one.>The church had absolutely no interest in providing a genuine sample of the shroud because it would show that the person, (presumably Jesus) who had been wrapped in it, was not dead but had survived the crucifixion. This Kersten & Gruber (and others') conspiracy theory is implausible on at least two grounds: 1) the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence is that Jesus was dead (see below); 2) if the RC Church really thought that the Shroud showed that Jesus survived the crucifixion and wanted to cover it up, it has had plenty of opportunities to destroy the Shroud (including two fires, one as late as 1997) and also to distance itself from the Shroud's authenticity. But instead the RCC has gone to immense lengths to preserve the Shroud, and despite all the claims that the Shroud is a fake, the RCC has never agreed with those claims (despite media hype to the contrary). Moreover, even after the 1989 carbon-dating result, the RCC has continued to exhibit the Shroud in 1998 and 2000 as though it was the genuine article, with Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI publicly stating their personal belief in its authenticity.It is in fact the \"Jesus ... was not dead but had survived the crucifixion\" theories that are themselves dead! Among the best evidence that Jesus did die on the Cross was provided by New York State medical examiner Dr. Frank Zugibe, who pointed out that \"If Jesus had been alive after the spear wound, the soldiers and others at the site would have heard a loud sucking sound caused by breath being inhaled past the chest wound\" (a fact no doubt well-known to the Romans soldiers, which is presumably why they did it):\"There are at least three signs on the Shroud that Jesus was dead when He was buried. First, the body of the man in the Shroud is in a state of rigor mortis, in which the muscles stiffen, keeping the body in the position the person occupied just prior to death. Such a state is complete in about twelve hours after death, begins to wear off in twenty-four hours, and disappears in thirty-six to forty hours. Of course, these times are variable and imprecise, and therefore somewhat unreliable. Closely related to rigor mortis is a state called cadaveric spasm, an immediate stiffening, a rather sudden contraction of the muscles that occurs quickly after some violent deaths. Rigor mortis is observable on the Shroud in several places. The head was bent forward, the feet were somewhat drawn up, and the left leg in particular had moved back toward its position on the cross. Especially visible in the three-dimensional image analysis of the Shroud are the retracted thumbs and the `frozen' posture of the chest and abdomen. As was also noted by Bucklin, the entire body was quite rigid and stiff, occupying some of the positions it did on the cross. The second evidence of death in the man of the Shroud is the post-mortem blood flow, especially from the chest wound. If the heart had been beating after burial, the blood literally would have been shot out onto the cloth. But the blood oozed out instead. Also, a comparatively small quantity of blood flowed, and there was no swelling around the wound. Finally, the blood from the chest, left wrist, and feet separated into clots and serum and was much thicker and of much deeper color than it would have been prior to death. Zugibe also mentioned a third piece of evidence based on his medical experience. If Jesus had been alive after the spear wound, the soldiers and others at the site would have heard a loud sucking sound caused by breath being inhaled past the chest wound. Zugibe related that when answering a distress call after a man had been stabbed in the chest, he heard the loud inhaling of the unconscious man all the way across the room. He saw this phenomenon as `a direct refutation of the theory that Christ was alive after being taken down from the cross.\" [Zugibe, F.T., \"The Cross and the Shroud,\" Angelus Books: New York NY, 1982, p.165]\" (Stevenson, K.E. & Habermas, G.R., \"The Shroud and the Controversy,\" Thomas Nelson Publishers: Nashville TN, 1990, p.113. Emphasis original)>The amount of blood shown on the cloth could not have been from a person who had been dead for three hours, particularely taking into account that it was customary that the upper part of the body was elevated when entombed. There in fact is not all that much blood on the Shroud (see above, \"a comparatively small quantity of blood flowed\"). And despite claims to the contrary, dead bodies can still bleed by oozing, even days after death, as the floor of any butcher shop will show.>Hence it would appear that the cloth provided by the church for carbon dating was an almost identically looking cloth dating from the 14th century.The RC Church did not provide the cloth, except by making the entire Shroud available for cutting off the sample. And the sample was cut off, not by a RC priest but by a scientist, the late Prof. Giovanni Riggi, in a videotaped ceremony which was attended by, amongst others, the British Museum's representaive and the chiefs of the three radiocarbon-dating laboratories.As I said above, it is possible there was a sample switch later (although I think it unlikely), but then it would have been done after the Shroud sample had been cut off, and was therefore no longer under the control of the RC Church.>Earlier pollen tests carried out on the shroud had shown it to have originated from the area of Jerusalem from the first century.Agreed, but that was from the same Shroud that the RC Church provided for the sample to be cut from. This also undercuts the RC Church \"had absolutely no interest in providing a genuine sample of the shroud\" theory, because: 1) the pollen samples were taken by  foresic scientist Max Frei at scientific examinations of the Shroud in 1973 and 1978. If the RCC thought the Shroud showed that Jesus survived the crucifixion, it would never have allowed those scientific tests, let alone allowed Frei, a Protestant, to take pollen samples from it.But no doubt this will make no difference to conspiracy theorists like yourself, to whom evidence against the conspiracy just shows how devious the RC Church was in making it look like there wasn't a conspiracy!Stephen E.

I had already stated in a comment, before the emails from Dr Jull and Prof. Ramsey were posted, confirming that their AMS control computers had never been online, that my alternative was that each of the three computers were hacked manually. When Prof. Ramsey confirmed that the AMS control console computers were not ever online, I thanked him for that and immediately modified my proposal to my alternative manual hacking of each of the three computers.>Has he determined if the AMS Control Consoles at all three labs had programmable computers There is no such thing as a NON-programmable computer. Prof. Ramsey confirmed that the AMS control console computers were under the control of “software,” which is just another name for a program. When I get to that part of my series I will give further evidence about this. […]>Anyways, Stephen has provided us with some historic information to consider.Indeed! Even though I have only posted historical evidence from the 12th and 13th centuries, it is sufficient to establish that the Shroud existed CENTURIES before the earliest, 1260, C-14 date of the Shroud. The agnostic art historian, Thomas de Wesselow, has written of only ONE of those items of historical evidence:“The poker-hole patterns represented in the Pray Codex drawing, first noticed in 1998, are also the FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF THE CARBON-DATING RESULT. The cloth now in Turin must be at least three centuries older than the earliest date indicated by the radiocarbon age of the sample tested – a sizeable error. The 95 per cent confidence level the laboratories cited is meaningless, except, perhaps, as a measure of scientific hubris. Physics is not the only way to date the Shroud; HISTORICAL AND ART-HISTORICAL RECORDS HAVE THEIR PART TO PLAY, as do the various indications gleaned from medical, chemical and archaeological investigations. This broad spectrum of research indicates that THE SHROUD DATES NOT FROM THE MIDDLE AGES, BUT FROM ANTIQUITY.” (de Wesselow, T., 2012, “The Sign: The Shroud of Turin and the Secret of the Resurrection,” p.182. My emphasis).You yourself Dan, state on your blog’s sidebar:“The carbon dating, once seemingly proving it was a medieval fake, is now widely thought of as suspect and meaningless. … Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford Radiocarbon Laboratory, thinks more testing is needed. So do many other scientists and archeologists. This is because there are significant scientific and non-religious reasons to doubt the validity of the tests.”How come the anti-authenticists on your blog don’t take issue with that?And if the carbon dating is wrong, how come it still `hit the bull’s eye’ of 1325 +/- 65, absent fraud, either by hacker(s) or by the labs? As has been pointed out by you Dan, and by others on your blog, the various other explanations for how the Shroud can be 1st century yet its C-14 date is 1325 +/- 65, don’t hold water. At best they explain why the Shroud should have C-14 dated early but not 1st century.Dan, I am continually being defamed on your blog (the latest that I am morally indecent), for being the only pro-authenticist who is publicly facing up to the key question: “how can the Shroud be 1st century, yet its C-14 date was 1325 +/- 65, just before the Shroud’s historical debut in the 1350s?”The 1st century + 16th century = 1325 +/- 65 repair theory doesn’t do that. It would be a MIRACLE, absent fraud, if the mix of 1st and 16th century linen, just happened, to produce that `bull’s eye’ date.>Nice new picture of Stephen.Thanks.

Doug immediately asked me to sign the following statement: “We the undersigned, understand that radiocarbon age results for the Shroud of Turin obtained from the University of Arizona AMS facility are confidential. We agree not to communicate the results to anyone-spouse, children, friends, press, etc., until that time when results are generally available to the public.” It had been signed by D J Donahue, Brad Gore, L J Toolin, P E Damon, Timothy Jull and ART HATHEWAY, all connected with the Arizona AMS facility, before I signed. My signature was followed by T W Linick and P J Sercel, also from the Arizona facility.” (Gove, H.E., , 1996, “Relic, Icon or Hoax?: Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud,” p.262. My emphasis).A Google search on “Art Hatheway Arizona” (without quotes) had turned up an obituary of an “Arthur Loyal Hatheway” who was “Senior Staff Engineer at the AMS Lab in the Physics Department at U of A.” and a “computer programmer”:“Arthur Loyal Hatheway Obituary HATHEWAY, Arthur Loyal, born in Los Angeles on March 26, 1940 to Philip and Pauline Hatheway, went suddenly to Jesus on October 11, 2008. … In 2006, Art retired from his position as Senior Staff Engineer at the AMS Lab in the Physics Department at U of A. There his skills as COMPUTER PROGRAMMER and small instrument engineer, his thorough nature and precise workmanship, his understanding of chemistry and physics, as well as his abilities to invent and mentor, WERE PUT TO GOOD USE. Art met Jesus in 1992. This new relationship changed his perspective on life …”.I am NOT alleging that Art Hatheway was one of the hacker, just that there was at least one member of the Arizona C-14 lab staff who was a “computer programmer” and indeed a “Senior Staff Engineer,” which is indicative of a high level of sophistication of the Arizona C-14 lab’s computers, and presumably the other C-14 labs’ computers. And that presumably a major role Senior Staff Engineer Hatheway’s role was ensuring the AMS control console computer program controlled the AMS C-14 dating process:“The first sample run was OX1. Then followed one of the controls. Each run consisted of a 10 second measurement of the carbon-13 current and a 50 second measurement of the carbon-14 counts. This is repeated nine more times and an average carbon-14/carbon-13 ratio calculated. ALL THIS WAS UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL and the calculations produced by THE COMPUTER were displayed on a cathode ray screen.” (Gove, 1996, p.264).I had originally thought that the computer which controlled the AMS dating was different from the AMS control console computer, but according to Gove’s words above, they were ONE AND THE SAME. Now a lab does not need to employ a “Senior Staff Engineer” who is also a “computer programmer” and who “put[s] to good use” those “skills,” on a computer which Prof. Ramsey gave the misleading impression was little more than a calculator:“The software was very simple just outputting counts of 14C and currents measured. Age calculation was done offline and could just be done with a calculator, or by a simple program into which you typed the numbers from the AMS.” (“Comment Promoted: On the Hacking Hypothesis,” March 9, 2014).and which led Dan to question whether it was even “programmable”. Now Prof. Ramsey is highly computer literate, being himself a computer programmer, as the author of “OxCal” a computer “program … intended to provide radiocarbon calibration”:OxCal The OxCal program is intended to provide radiocarbon calibration and … For further information contact the author: Prof. … christopher.ramsey@rlaha.ox.ac.uk.”So Prof. Ramsey presumably KNOWS VERY WELL that the AMS control system computers at Arizona, Zurich and Oxford were not little more than “a calculator” but were PROGRAMMABLE computers, controlling the entire complex AMS radiocarbon dating process as well as outputting the uncalibrated C-14 dates of each sample onto their screens.I personally find Prof. Ramsey’s (and Dr Jull’s) defensiveness significant. But again, I repeat, that I am NOT alleging that the late Art Hatheway (or Prof. Ramsey) was one of the hackers. All I am seeking to establish is that the C-14 labs’ AMS control console computers were PROGRAMMABLE.

I then discovered that he died on June 4, 1989, aged 42, a few months after the Nature paper to which he was a signatory appeared, on February 16 of that year. Moreover, it was rumoured that Linick committed suicide.It may be significant that Karl Koch, a self-confessed (after was caught) hacker who had worked for the KGB, died on May 23, 1989, less than 2 weeks earlier than Linick, in what appeared to be an execution designed to look like suicide.I Googled the names of other signatories to the 1988 Nature paper but found no other untimely deaths. However, as the Wikipedia article on Karl Koch notes, Koch’s fellow hackers Pengo (Hans Heinrich Hübner), and Urmel (Markus Hess) also confessed that they had worked for the KGB but were not eliminated.While I do not claim that Timothy W. Linick WAS a hacker, nor that his untimely death WAS suicide, let alone an execution by the KGB designed to look like suicide, it nevertheless is worth keeping in mind as a possible piece of the jigsaw.This will no doubt be dismissed as a “conspiracy theory” by those who prefer mindless slogans to thinking. But it is a FACT that the KGB did CONSPIRE with hackers, notably Karl Koch, of whose death Wikipedia notes that, “there is little evidence supporting suicide and many believe that Koch was killed in order to keep him from confessing more to the authorities”.

On Googling “Linick Arizona computer” (without the quotes) I found the paper, Linick, T.W., et al. 1986, “Operation of the NSF-Arizona accelerator facility for radioisotope analysis and results from selected collaborative research projects,” Radiocarbon, Vol. 28, No. 2a, pp.522-533.In it the late Dr Linick, described the computerised process that Prof. Gove wrote of Arizona lab’s AMS control console computer, and wrote that it is a “DEC computer system”: “The DEC computer system largely controls the cycling of isotopes, accumulation of data, and calculation of results for each 15-minute run.”“DEC” stands for Digital Equipment Corporation, the maker of the powerful PDP and VAX range of minicomputer which were very popular in laboratories in the 1980s. However I have been unable to discover what model it was, e,g. PDP-11, VAX-11, etc.Googling “DEC” and then selecting “images,” the Arizona Labs AMS control console computer in the photo on page 176H of Prof. Gove’s book (see my latest post), looks like a DEC VT-100 terminal.If that is so, and given that Arizona’s AMS system was installed in 1981, its AMS control console computer was probably a 32-bit VAX-11: “In 1976, DEC decided to extend the PDP-11 architecture to 32-bits while adding a complete virtual memory system to the simple paging and memory protection of the PDP-11. The result was the VAX architecture, where VAX stands for Virtual Address eXtension (from 16 to 32 bits). The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the VAX-11/780, which DEC referred to as a superminicomputer. Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780’s combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its Jupiter project, which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as the single computer architecture for the company.” (“Digital Equipment Corporation: VAX,” Wikipedia, 10 March 2014).Supporting the VAX’s success was the VT52, one of the most successful smart terminals. Building on earlier less successful models (the VT05 and VT50), the VT52 was the first terminal that did everything one might want in a single chassis. The VT52 was followed by the even more successful VT100 and its follow-ons, making DEC one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry. With the VT series, DEC could now offer a complete top-to-bottom system from computer to all peripherals, which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers.Whatever DEC computer system it was, whether a PDP or VAX, it CERTAINLY was programmable and therefore HACKABLE!","date":"March 31, 2014 at 8:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/29/stephen-jones-revised-hacking-theory-part-i-is-available/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones’ Revised Hacking Theory Part I is Available"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Dan, after I posted the above (with its 6 outside links) I realised that the text beginning with “Supporting the VAX’s success … ” should have been after “for the company” and inside the Wikipedia article reference, If you delete it, and this brief message, I will post it again with the error corrected.","date":"March 31, 2014 at 8:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/29/stephen-jones-revised-hacking-theory-part-i-is-available/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones’ Revised Hacking Theory Part I is Available"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"I should have added, “my apologies”.

Stephen left out two of my favorite historical items:1) The Hymn of the Pearl and 2) The Mozarabic Rite.  They are coming. The Hymn of the Pearl is 2nd century and the Mozarabic Rite is 6th century. As my Revised #1 post indicated, I am going to list all the “historical evidence that the Shroud existed in the thirteenth century all the way back to the first century:”My first step is to show beyond any reasonable doubt that the Shroud existed well beyond the lower limit of the C-14 dating’s lower limit of 1260, and therefore the C-14 dating was wrong.My second step is to show that the odds are astronomical for the Shroud to be 1st century, yet C-14 date to 1325 +/- 65, and therefore there must have been fraud involved for the Shroud’s C-14 date to not just be any old date, but the too good to be true date ~25 years before the Shroud’s historical debut at Lirey, France in the 1350s.My last step will be to lay out the case for the fraud to have been perpetrated, not by the labs, but by a computer hacker, or hackers, physically accessing each AMS control console computer in the three university C-14 labs at Arizona, Zurich and Oxford, and modifying each computer’s program which received output of raw uncalibrated C-14 dates from each lab’s AMS system and replaced the Shroud’s dates with dates, which when when calibrated, would cluster around 1325 +/- 65. My prime suspect is the KGB employing as agents a ring of hackers, inside or outside the three universities, since the KGB has a proven track record of using at least one such ring of hackers, the Chaos Computer Club. The USSR in the late 1980s was facing the threat of breaking up (the Berlin Wall came down in late 1989). So with its atheist ideology and huge Russian Orthodox and Roman Catholic populations, the USSR would have felt very threatened by the prospect of a 1st or early century date of the Shroud. So even though it did not believe the Shroud to be authentic, it would have wanted to `take out insurance’ that the Shroud did not return a first or early century C-14 date.   But as the school year has begun, I am again working part-time as a high school relief teacher. So my time is limited, and it is going to take many months to get to the end of this multi-part series. However, unlike Dan, I am in no hurry. I am enjoying filling in the gaps in my knowledge of the historical evidence for the Shroud’s existence back to the 1st century.","date":"March 29, 2014 at 7:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/29/stephen-jones-revised-hacking-theory-part-i-is-available/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones’ Revised Hacking Theory Part I is Available"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">you should at least have the moral decency Ad hominem noted.>to contact the labs and ask them their opinion before exposing your theory.Hugh Farey has already emailed Arizona’s Dr Jull and Oxford’s Prof. Ramsey for their response to my proposal and they have, not surprisingly, rejected it, albeit with fallacious reasoning and false facts. See my post, “Were the radiocarbon dating laboratories duped by a computer hacker?: My replies to Dr. Timothy Jull and Prof. Christopher Ramsey“.But they would do that even if my proposal was true, that the labs UNKNOWINGLY were victims of computer hacker(s) in their 1988 C-14 dating of the Shroud.My proposal is NOT that the labs KNOW that they were victims of a computer hacking and I said in one of my comments here that they would probably be unaware of it to this day and therefore would not welcome the thought that after all these years their 1260-1390 C-14 date of the Shroud was the result of them having been hacked.So I am NOT accusing the C-14 labs of fraud. My proposal is that they were the VICTIMS of fraud, committed by a computer hacker or hackers.When I have finished my multi-part series, “Were the radiocarbon dating laboratories duped by a computer hacker?: Revised,” I will have more evidence to support my proposal, when I may then call it a theory. If and when that point is reached, I have not ruled out that I may formally submit my then theory to the Directors of each of the three laboratories for their comments.But even then, I expect they would reject my then theory, even if it was true. It would be a HUGE embarrassment if the C-14 labs had been hacked in their dating of the Shroud and so they would have a strong motivation to deny it and would be unlikely to cooperate with requests for information to support my proposal.So all that I can do is set out the evidence for my proposal and hope that someone who was involved in, or aware of, the hackings would come forward and confirm that my proposal was true.","date":"March 30, 2014 at 3:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/29/stephen-jones-revised-hacking-theory-part-i-is-available/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones’ Revised Hacking Theory Part I is Available"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Coincidentally, I re-read this letter to NATURE (17 October 1991, p.598) only yesterday in going through some of my science journal articles on the Shroud.According to Wikipedia, Cesare Emiliani (1922-1995) was “one of the greatest geologists and micropaleontologists of the 20th century and the founder of paleoceanography … a Renaissance man, familiar with classical literature, fluent in many languages, and a valiant opponent of dogmatic attitudes and mental rigidity wherever found. In his later years he dedicated much time to introduce a calendar reform based on the Holocene calendar (HE) concept to eliminate the BC-AD chronology gap caused by the lack of a Year Zero.” Emiliani’s eminence may be why NATURE published such a strange letter.Emiliani’s opening comment in his letter was: “Pierre Busson laments the various problems arising from the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud of Turin. As I see it, there is only one problem: the dating itself. The Shroud of Turin is a religious object and, as such, it should never have been subjected to scientific scrutiny.”That Science-Religion (Gnostic?) ultimate duality is very common in the USA and is supported by the US Supreme Court’s extreme separation of Church and State doctrine. It is a major defensive weapon of the Naturalist (“nature is all there is”) side in the USA’s Creation-Evolution struggle and tellingly Emiliani refers to “Creationists” being “even more guilty, for they have been mixing science and religion for years …” That Science-Religion duality is also, in my opinion, a major (albeit largely unrecognised) theme in the Shroud debate, with even some leading Shroud pro-authenticity advocates claiming that science can never prove the Shroud to be the burial sheet of Jesus. Yet every day individuals are imprisoned and even executed on far less Forensic Science evidence pointing uniquely to them, than the evidence of the Shroud points uniquely to Jesus.We are all blind to some extent to our motives (Ps 19:12; Jer 17:9), but many (if not most) scientists in particular don’t seem to even realise the possibility that their attempts to isolate “religion” from the real world of science is actually a subconscious attempt to isolate the Christian God (who they intuitively know exists – Rom 1:18-20) from their guilty conscience. In the light of his comments in his NATURE letter, Emiliani’s crusade to “eliminate … BC-AD” from the calendar seems to be just another such attempt to cover himself with a “fig leaf” from the all-seeing eye of His Creator (Gen 3:7) by writing Jesus out of the Play that He Himself wrote, starred in, and directs!Stephen","date":"January 28, 2010 at 8:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/01/28/strangest-quote-ever-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Strangest Quote Ever on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">Emilani was a respected scientist … he pulls the strings of religion fundamentalists who ridiculously believe that a painted cloth woven in the middle age was the shroud of Christ.There are irreligious fundamentalists too. The late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould famously included biologist Richard Dawkins in the category of “Darwinian Fundamentalism” in the June 12, 1997 issue of The New York Review of Books. But because Naturalism, the philosophy that “nature is all there is” (“Naturalism (philosophy),” Wikipedia, 14 April 2010) (i.e. there is no supernatural, including God), so dominates science and our science-based culture generally, it is invisible to those whose minds have been fully taken captive by it (Col 2:8). To Metaphysical Naturalists, it is simply “ridiculous” that the Shroud of Turin even could be the burial sheet of Christ, because that would imply that there is a God who can and does supernaturally intervene in the world, and to whom they might be accountable. Since Naturalism is unquestionably true for fully committed Naturalists, they cannot accept that there even could be evidence, let alone seriously consider it, that the Shroud is the burial sheet of Jesus, if that implies that the Gospels are true and that He rose from the dead.it is sufficient therefore for Naturalists to accept the best (or least worst) Naturalistic explanation of the Shroud’s image (e.g. it is just a medieval forgery, etc), combined with personally attacking (e.g. as “religious fundamentalists,” etc) those of us whose minds have not been captured by Naturalism, and can and do accept the evidence which overwhelmingly points to the Shroud of Turin being the very burial sheet of Jesus and bearing the image of His crucified and resurrected body!

But HOW MUCH MORE would a first or early century date of the SHROUD be an affront to the atheistic Soviet Union in the 1980s that it, through its `dirty tricks’ agency, the KGB, would be motivated to ensure that the Shroud did not return a 1st century or early C14 date?>why have none of these conspirators since revealed what happened. They may yet. I have previously posted to the effect, that now my proposal is in the public domain, one of the hackers, an ex-KGB agent, or someone else, who knows what happened, may confirm my proposal.But fear of KGB retaliation:“Koch was loosely affiliated with the Chaos Computer Club. He … was involved in selling hacked information from United States military computers to the KGB. … Koch was found BURNED TO DEATH with gasoline in a forest near Celle, Germany. The death was officially claimed to be a suicide. However … there is little evidence supporting suicide and many believe that Koch was KILLED IN ORDER TO KEEP HIM FROM CONFESSING MORE TO THE AUTHORITIES.” (“Karl Koch,” Wikipedia);or fear of prosecution, and also that the hacker(s) likely believe that Shroud is a fake, might prevent anyone blowing the whistle.>… What motivation is there to keeping up the game of the rigged dates via hacking? PLENTY! See above. Last time I checked the ex-head of the KGB, Vladimir Putin, is the President of Russia. And how many hackers have VOLUNTARILY admitted their past hacking? Not many, if any.>To be honest, Stephen, I feel you truly believe there was a conspiracy between the labs themselves to present a medieval date. No. While I firmly believe that there HAD to be fraud of some kind to convert a 1st (or early) century date of the Shroud to the `too good to be true’ 1325 +/- 65 C14 date, the worst that I have suggested is that the labs may have been guilty of low-level fraud:“… making results appear just a little crisper or more definitive than they really are, or selecting just the `best’ data for publication and ignoring those that don’t fit …” (Broad & Wade, 1982, p.20)and that is still my fall-back position.But bearing in mind Ian Wilson’s view, from knowing the lab leaders personally, that they were basically honest and would not have “rigged” the result, I wanted to explore a way that there could have been fraud in the C14 dating, but by a hacker, not by the labs.>But prudence, lack of evidence or legal fear prevents you from outright accusing them of fraud, therefore you are using this hacking theory as the thin edge of the wedge.No. As far as I am aware, there would be no possibility of legal action against me if I accused `the C14 laboratories’ of fraud, but only if I accused individuals BY NAME in the laboratories of fraud.My only reason for not accusing outright the C14 laboratories of fraud is that I don’t believe that there was fraud by the laboratories, unless it was the above low-level fraud.>There are lots of clues and oddities in the whole C14 business that do raise some question marks but what no one has presented yet is hard evidence of any date fudging or sample switching.I have been presenting the evidence for my proposal and taken on board what evidence there is against it. But in the nature of the case, being secret hacking carried out 26 years ago, it is only circumstantial evidence. If a hacker or KGB agent confessed to the hacking would that be “hard evidence”. But there are other forms of hard “evidence.” If a member of the C14 labs admitted that a hacker COULD have done what I have described. Dr Jull and Prof. Ramsey have not done that. Indeed, Prof. Ramsey’s, “This would seem to be a suggestion from someone [me] who does not know what computers were like in the 1980s” is not only over-defensive, it is actually FALSE. As I pointed out, I know VERY WELL “what what computers were like in the 1980s”:“… I was one of the first to have a personal computer in 1980. I pioneered the introduction of computers into Health Department of WA hospitals in the mid-to late 1980s and in the late 1980s/early 1990s, I was the Systems Administrator of a network of 7 hospitals’ UNIX systems.”Prof. Ramsey’s too-defensive and FALSE over-reaction, makes me suspicious that he may think that I have a point, which he doesn’t want to face up to.Best of all would be to find the hacker’s code on at least one of the original AMS control console computers. But although Arizona’s AMS system which did the 1988 is still operational (Google: “Arizona AMS 1981 operational”), I doubt that it is still there, with its original software, or at the other two labs. But even if at least one of the original AMS control console computers is still there, complete with what looks like the original software but no hacker’s code, that would not disconfirm my proposal, because the KGB would likely have insisted the hacker remove his code when he had finished, as KGB agent Markus Hess removed evidence of his hacking.>A single whistleblower, or late confession, or damning email would go a long way to exposing the crime. Agreed. See above. That may yet happen. It is early days.>Until then they are just theories, conspiracy theories, and accordingly given the gravity they warrant.I don’t claim my proposal has yet reached the level of a theory.But as for the pejorative term “conspiracy theory,” which is designed to “poison the well” against me personally:“Poisoning the well … is a rhetorical device where adverse information about a target is pre-emptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say.” (Wikipedia).to discredit me personally in the minds of readers so they won’t accept my proposal:My proposal indeed is that the KGB CONSPIRED with a hacker or hackers to ensure that the Shroud returned a 14th century C14 date. There is abundant evidence that the KGB did conspire with hackers (Google “Chaos Computer Club” and also “Cyberpunk Hafner”).

I am 67 and I have lived through the pre-Internet, Internet, and pre-Web eras. I caught my first computer virus, the Stoned Virus in 1987. Google ” Stoned Virus”.The hacker who Clifford Stoll caught, Markus Hess, hacked into 400 US military computers in 1986. Google “Clifford Stoll.”Hess was a member of a group of Hackers called the “Chaos Computing Club, “founded in Berlin on September 12, 1981.” (“Chaos Computing Club,” Wikipedia).So it is not ME who is writing “nonsense”!I have already stated here, following Dr. Jull and Prof. Ramsey’s confirmation that the AMS control console computers (at least at Arizona and Oxford) were never online, that my proposal now is the alternative (which I had mentioned before their confirmation) that the hacker or hacker’s inserted a new program, or more likely modified the existing one, at each of the three laboratories. Each of which had the same AMS C-14 dating system.The whole point of Clifford Stoll’s book, the “Cuckoo’s Egg” (read it) is that in the 1980, all universities both physically and computer-wise, lacked security. Stoll did his PhD at the University of Arizona, so he would especially have had that university in mind. The C-14 tests were weeks and even months apart in 1988: Arizona (May 6), Zurich (May 26) and Oxford (August 8). It would not have been difficult for a hacker, or hackers, to before each test, gain access to the AMS control console computers at each of the three labs and modify the program which received inputs from the AMS system, converted it into raw uncalibrated years and displayed those years on the control console computer’s screen. From the photo of Arizona’s AMS control console computer in Gove’s book, which I had already posted, it looks like a simple personal computer, such as a Tandy TRS-80, or similar. All such 1980s PCs came with a simple programming language called BASIC, which I used to write programs in.The Shroud samples would have to have had a unique identifying code (otherwise the labs would not know which dates applied to the Shroud), so it would be easy for a hacker to modify the program (especially if it was written in BASIC) so that if the data was coming from the Shroud samples, whatever their dates were, to replace those dates with dates, which when calibrated, clustered around 1325, just before the Shroud’s known historical debut in the 1350s.The KGB had already recruited and paid hackers before 1988. For example Markus Hess in 1986 and other members of the Chaos Computer Club (Google “Karl Koch”). But they were only the KGB’s hackers WHO WERE CAUGHT. There is no reason why there could not have been other hackers, recruited and paid by the KGB, who were NOT CAUGHT. And there is no reason why some those not caught hackers were not paid by the KGB to ensure the Shroud C-14 dated to just before the 1350.I will develop these points in my next posts in this series: “Were the radiocarbon dating laboratories duped by a computer hacker?: Revised","date":"March 16, 2014 at 12:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/the-computer-hacker-hypothesis-is-short-on-factual-material/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Computer Hacker Hypothesis is Short on Factual Material"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Prof. Christopher Ramsey Bronk, aka “C.R. Bronk,” the first-mentioned name from Oxford in the 1989 Nature article declaring that “The age of the shroud is obtained as AD 1260-1390” (AD1325 +/- 65 years) and therefore “the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval.” That presumably means that he was the scientist at Oxford who actually did the test. If so he must have known that the Shroud samples contained cotton that was “possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old.” But the other two labs, Tucson and Zurich had already run their tests 2-3 months previously, and had arrived at a date of about AD1350. The three AMS labs would normally be in regular contact with each other so it beggars belief that the labs did not share their results of their dating of the Shroud. Anyway, there is evidence that they did.Ramsey would then have had a dilemma: 1. He knew that the other two labs which had already dated their samples at ~AD1350 had not discovered the cotton (they hadn’t), so their dates would have included the cotton. 2. So if Oxford removed the cotton from its sample, then Oxford’s date could not have been the same consensus ~AD1350 date as the other two.3. If the cotton was “of Egyptian origin and quite old” and was not removed, it would have made their Shroud sample appear to be much older than ~AD1350.There seems to be only one honourable way out of Ramsey’s dilemma and that is if both the cotton and the Shroud sample were about the same ~AD1350 age. But then why would the cotton appear to be “yellow  … possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old” even under a 200X microscope if it was in reality the same ~AD1350 age of the Shroud linen sample?The only answer seems to be that the cotton was dyed yellow to make it look like the linen. And it took it being “magnified 200 times under a microscope” to discover that it was cotton.But this is precisely what the “medieval repair” or Benford-Marino “Reweaving Theory” maintains. That the tiny 1.2 x 0.8 cm sample that the three labs were given from the same area of the Shroud and then divided equally amongst themselves for dating, was not part of the Shroud itself, but was actually a medieval patch added to the Shroud for repairs, using cotton dyed to make it look invisible to the naked eye against the background of the yellow linen.So if Ramsey continues to maintain “the suggestions of … medieval repair were unlikely” then he has no honourable way to explain how the other two labs arrived at an ~AD1350 date, even though their sample included what appeared to be old Egyptian cotton; and his Oxford lab arrived at the same date with the same cotton removed. Unless Oxford deliberately re-ran its test on a sub-sample with the cotton included so as to make it appear to agree with the other two labs. Or if Ramsey claims the cotton was not old, then he needs to explain: 1. how old was it? And 2. why did it look old and yellow, even under a 200X microscope.","date":"January 4, 2012 at 10:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/04/what-did-christopher-ramsey-know/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"What did Christopher Ramsey Know"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">Ramey’s … showed himself to be completely openminded in taking on the lab work involved in checking out the carbon monoxide hypothesisAs I pointed out previously, Jackson’s carbon monoxide hypothesis would be an honourable way out for all three labs.

What we all have to live with is the fact that the one person who should know, Ms Flury Lemburg, refuses to countenance it.Whether David intended “Ms Flury Lemburg … refuses to countenance it” literally, it does seem to be the impression created by Mechthild Flury-Lemberg rejection of Benford and Marino’s invisible reweaving theory, backed up as it is with a wealth of scientific evidence. According to Joe Marino (private email), Flury-Lemberg’s main objection to the reweave theory is that such invisible weaving would be visible on the reverse side, and she had not personally seen it when she examined the Shroud (see her “The Invisible Mending of the Shroud in Theory and Reality,” BSTS Newsletter No. 65, June 2007).But as Benford and Marino pointed out in their paper, “Discrepancies in the radiocarbon dating area of the Turin shroud,” Chemistry Today, July-August 2008, medieval reweaving could be made to be invisble on both sides:“Historical evidence demonstrates that it was not only possible for medieval weavers and embroiderers to invisibly mend textiles such that they were not top-side detectable, but it is also recognized that they could choose whether or not to permit their handiwork from being detected on the back side as well.`Historically, reweaving was not carried out through a support fabric and was often executed so skilfully that it is not always recognizable as a later addition, although differences in the rate of dye fading have often revealed its presence. Evidence of reweaving would now (16th Century) usually be left deliberately visible on the reverse of the tapestry by the presence of the warp ends and knots’ [F. Lennard, M. Hayward, Tapestry Conservation: Principles and Practice. Burlington, Massachusetts: Butterworth-Heinemann 16 (2006)]As this passage infers, skilful medieval weavers could choose whether or not to leave evidence of their work on the back side of a fabric. Although a less-than-conventional restoration practice, it is known that in early part of the 16th Century the art of `reversing’ was practiced such that tapestries could be viewed intact from either side of the cloth.”These very cotton fibres that Oxford discovered in their sample, yet  Tucson and Zurich had not, and which required 200x magnification to determine that they were cotton, is itself evidence that just looking at the Shroud with the naked eye, may be not enough to detect expert medieval reweaving that is designed to not be visible to the naked eye.","date":"January 5, 2012 at 1:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/04/what-did-christopher-ramsey-know/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"What did Christopher Ramsey Know"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"First two corrections: “4 x 2 metre” should be “4 x 1 metre” or “4.4 x 1.1 metres.” And “Ramsay” should be “Ramsey” as mostly stated.I presume Ramsey’s real name is Christopher Ramsey Bronk, as per the Nature article and books on his web page (http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/CBR.html), but he (understandably) prefers “Ramsey” to “Bronk”!It is also worth noting that his name appears on the 1989 Nature paper first of those from Oxford: “… C.R.

But as I pointed out in a recent comment:---------------------------------It is a fallacy to think that the authenticity of the Shroud stands or falls on ONE feature alone. Shroud sceptics (i.e. true believers in the Shroud's NON-authenticity) typically take pot-shots at individual features of the Shroud, and if they THINK that they have won on ONE individual point, they can declare victory for the forgery theory.But what the Shroud sceptics need to do is propose a COMPREHENSIVE AND INTERNALLY CONSISTENT forgery theory, which:1) POSITIVELY explains plausibly how the image on the Shroud was formed in a way that is inconsistent with the Shroud's authenticity, including not only HOW the image was formed, but WHEN it was formed, and WHO formed it;and2) NEGATIVELY plausibly explains away ALL the evidence for the Shroud's authenticity.That there is NO such comprehensive and internally consistent forgery theory, is itself evidence that the Shroud is NOT a forgery. In my \"The Shroud of Turin\" series, I am collecting problems of the forgery theory which I will eventually post as \"Problems of the forgery theory.\" Then it will be seen that the problems of the Shroud authenticity theory are NOTHING compared to the problems of the forgery theory.---------------------------------What the anti-authenticists need to do is compare the TOTAL pro-authenticist general theory/model against a TOTAL anti-authenticist general theory/model. Then they would see that the pro-authenticist general theory/model has FAR less problems than the anti-authenticist general theory/model. A comprehensive and internally consistent pro-authenticists general theory/model could be collated from Ian Wilson's writings. But its counterpart could not be collated from any anti-authentists writings.There is NO anti- authenticist general theory/model and and anti-authenticist sub-theories contradict each other and no one sub-theory has won the majority support of most anti- authenticists. Unscrupulous anti-authenticists like Joe Nickell argue for BOTH the painting theory: \"In fact, there is no mention of this particular `shroud' for some thirteen centuries; then a respected bishop reportedly uncovered an artist who confessed to having created it. In a letter of 1389 to Pope Clement VII, Bishop Pierre d'Arcis reported on an earlier investigation ... D'Arcis continued, speaking of the earlier bishop who conducted the investigation: Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed\" (Nickell, J., 1993, \"Looking for a Miracle,\" pp.25-26.

This technique automatically yields 'negative' images (or rather, just like the shroud, quasi-negative images, since the hair and beard are the opposite of what would be expected). It also produces numerous other shroudlike features, including minimal depth of penetration into the threads, encoded `3-D' information, and other similarities, some of which specifically pointed to some form of imprinting technique. \"(Nickell, 1993, pp.27-28). when they are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

But Porter claims that he still believes in the Shroud's authenticity. But if he did, then he would presumably (unless he thinks the Shroud was hidden from the 1st century and next turned up in mid-14th century France) accept that Byzantine artists would have been able to see and copy the face on the Shroud for nearly seven centuries, in Edessa from the 6th-10th century and then in Constantinople from the 10th to early 13th century. If so, then why does Porter reject the simplest explanation (as per Ockham's Razor) that the 15 oddities which are on the face of the Shroud, some of which are physical flaws and creases in the cloth - not part of the image itself, and are ALL 15 are found on various Byzantine depictions of Jesus' face (up to 13 on some of them) from the 6th to the 13th centuries?The answer can only be, absent Porter stating what evidence DOES persuade him that the Shroud is authentic, is that Porter is NOT TELLING THE TRUTH (at least to himself), that he actually has become a Shroud ANTI-authenticist. That is OK. Porter can be an anti-authenticist if that's how he sees (or wants to see) the evidence. But Porter should come clean and not hide behind his weasel words: \"Is the Shroud real? Probably. The Shroud of Turin may be the real burial cloth of Jesus\" (my emphasis). Stephen E. Jones---------------------------------\"MY POLICIES ...

Turin shroud older than thought -- NOTFri Jan 28, 2005 4:48 am Stephen E.

Organic preservatives applied to the linen and absorbed by it would also reduce the radiocarbon age; and 3) Stevenson & Habermas mention that the Shroud has been for much of its history stored in vaults in castles and monasteries. If those vaults were stone and those stones contained uranium and uranium decay products (which is likely), then they would be a source of neutrons that would have had the effect of reducing the Shroud's radiometric age.This is not to discredit radiocarbon dating generally, but it is to point out the precariousness of relying on radiocarbon dating of *one* sample (i.e. the Shroud), and then using it to trump all other evidence.[...]-----------------------------------Maybe at the end of my current series I will write a blog post outlining problems with the \"medieval ...

The Shroud has had a unique history, having been handled by countless hands, and a large part of that history is unknown. Yet that unknown history could be very important in assessing how much new carbon has been added to the linen. E.g. if the Shroud had been kept in granite castles/monasteries by the Templars and/or the Savoys, it may have been subject to a prolonged neutron flux from radon gas (a decay product of uranium and thorium which is in granite and accumulates in granite rooms-see \"Radon: Accumulation in houses,\" Wikipedia), which could have converted Nitrogen 14 in the Shroud to Carbon 14.Remember that there only is a very tiny amount of C14 in carbon:\"Donahue ... offered an analogy to illustrate it. `Let's say the shroud material is 1,000 acres of green marbles piled three feet deep, and in there somewhere is one blue marble,' he said in a telephone interview from his Tucson laboratory. `We've got to find the blue marble. It's daunting, but we can do it.' \" (Kenneth R. Clark, \"Shroud of Turin Controversy Resumes,\" Chicago Tribune, January 17, 1988.)so it would not take much new C14 added and/or original C14 lost to give a misleadingly young radiocarbon date.A part of the Shroud's history which is known is that it has been in a major fire in 1532 in which molten silver (which melts at 962ºC = 1571ºF) has burned through multiple layers of the cloth. And water used to douse the fire would have created superheated steam. The effects of  962ºC heat and superheated steam in an enclosed box could have forced new carbon deep into the linen, and even becoming a part of it, where it could never be removed by pre-treatment. C14 labs warn against mere tobacco smoking near a sample to be C14 dated! >Archaeologists usually deal with items that have been 'secluded', not carried all over, handled, mended or exposed to outside influences/contaminations. Agreed. See above.>Even in the cases of 'secluded' RCD testings there have been anomolies! I have read that up to 50% of tests must be redone because of anomolies. Where does that put the Shroud in the error percentage scale? I'd say it's up there; Like a 95% chance of error from from a 'single' reading, possbly.Agreed. If it was any other linen artifact the C14 labs would have been much more cautious in claiming that an artifact which has historical evidence that it existed at least from the sixth century, and has such a known  contamination history, and  unknown history, can be \"conclusively\" proved to be \"medieval ... AD 1260-1390.\"The AD 1260-1390 date, i.e. 1325 +/- 65 is just too good to be true, considering all the problems AMS dating had had up to then, and yet the Shroud would have been one of the most problematic artifacts to carbon-date, given its history.Yet the middle date, 1325, `just happened' to be about 20 years before the Shroud first appeared in documented European history, at Lirey France in about 1355.Therefore I suspect that the actual C14 dates may have ranged from 1st to 16th century AD, the former being the true date of  the Shroud and the latter that of the medieval invisible repair, but the C14 labs had too much prestige at stake (let alone the anti-Christianity of their leaders, Gove, Damon, Hall and Wolfli) to admit publicly that their new AMS method (or rather they) had failed, and what's more the Shroud could have been Jesus'. So out of their range of dates they chose those which averaged just before 1355, and ignored the rest.Stephen E.

I recognize Christ as a historical personage and I see no reason why anyone should be scandalized that there still exist material traces of his earthly life.'\" (Walsh, J.E., \"The Shroud,\" 1963, p.107).the 1988 \"medieval\" radiocarbon date of the Shroud would have been set aside as unlikely to be correct, because  of all the other evidence that the Shroud dates back to at least the sixth century.>Also when one considers the 'assumptions' that are made in the process of the dating such as assuming c14 production has been relatively equal over periods of time. The main problem of C14 dating is the assumption that no new carbon has been gained and no original carbon has been lost. But the C14 labs have no way of knowing that. The three C14 labs did check that the C13/C14 ratio was constant but that only tells them there has been no C14 only added and/or lost. It does not tell them if there has been new carbon (i.e. C12, C13, and C14 together) added and/or old carbon lost.For example, if a medieval repair was part of the cloth dated, the C14 labs could not tell that, because it would contain C12, C13 and C14 in the same proportion as a 2,000 year old linen Shroud.>Furthermore the fact that actually only one test was performed, not actually three as the sample was from one area of the cloth and not from various locations as it should have been. When I did Ecology in my Biology degree, we were told that samples from an area were not statistically valid unless they were taken randomly from different parts of that area and in sufficient quantity. A tiny postage-size sample taken from a deliberately chosen bottom corner of a 1.4 x 1.1 metre cloth, because it was already damaged there, is not a statistically valid sample.[continued]","date":"March 22, 2012 at 9:20 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/03/four-proofs-that-ad-1260-1390.html","title":"Four proofs that the AD 1260-1390 radiocarbon date for the Shroud has to be wrong!: #2 The Vignon markings (4)"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>Point is are people so gullible or ignorant of the limitations of RC dating or have they been 'duped' into believing so?

Quite simply, the reality of the Shroud and its possible ramifications scares them. They know that an authentic Shroud of Turin puts their atheism on shaky ground. A comment by a bishop to one such skeptic really puts the whole significance of the Shroud in perspective. The bishop told him, `If the Shroud turned out to be 2,000 years old, it wouldn't really affect my faith, but it might affect yours'. Thus in a real sense, the Shroud is more important for skeptics than it is for Christians.

The drink of wine mingled with gall ('myrrh' in Mark) is usually understood as a narcotic to reduce the pain of crucifixion, and Sanhedrin 43a tells us that such a drink was offered by the noble ladies of Jerusalem to those about to be executed (a practice inspired by Pr. 31:6-7).

The sour local wine which they gave Him was 'laced' with myrrh; this would give it a bitter taste, but a soporific effect, and was an act of mercy. Jesus, however, would not take any such anaesthetic; all His faculties must be unclouded for what lay before Him. Such drugged wine, tradition tells us, was provided by pious women of Jerusalem for condemned criminals, to dull the pains of execution: whether 'incense' (so the Talmud) or myrrh was used, makes little difference.\" (Cole, R.A. 1989, \"The Gospel According to Mark,\" Tyndale, p.316.

No. If fainting when undergoing extreme pain was a way of avoiding that pain, then crucifixion (and indeed most torture) would be pointless and we would not need anaesthetic during surgery!

If the Pray Manuscript's \"The Entombment\" and \"Visit to the Sepulchre\" scenes, in Berkovits, 1969, plate III, were based on the gospels' descriptions of those events, then we would expect something like Caravaggio's \"The Entombment of Christ\" and Il Baciccio's \"The Three Marys at the Sepulchre.\" But these, while they are no doubt great works of old Christian art, have NO unique features in common with the Shroud as the Pray Manuscript has (e.g. the shroud is more than twice Jesus' length, L-shaped `poker holes', herringbone weave, Jesus is nude, His hands are crossed in front of him, a bloodstain on Jesus forehead exactly where there is a \"reversed 3\" bloodstain on the Shroud, etc). >The Codex depicts a single long cloth under the body and wrapped (or about to be wrapped) over top of the head, like the Shroud. However, a naive reading of only the Gospels themselves, and taking the Gospel descriptions as an exhaustive description of the cloths, would tend to give a different impression. Agreed. There is nowhere near enough detail in the gospels for the Pray Manuscript artist to INDEPENDENTLY come up with depictions of Jesus' entombment and of the visit of the women to the empty tomb, that by chance `just happens' to have the same unique features above which are also on the Shroud.>It seems very unlikely that the artist would have drawn the burial cloth the way he did based only on the Gospel accounts, without additional information to go on. Together with the naked body, crossed wrists, etc, we have good evidence that the additional information was the Shroud.Agreed. See above. Those who claim that the Pray Manuscript is not based on the Shroud would have to come up with a plausible explanation of how the Pray Codex (1192-95), the writing in which is in Old Hungarian, was unknown even in Hungary until Hungarian historian György Pray rediscovered it in 1770, `just happens' to have at least 12 unique features in common with the Shroud of Turin, when the latter, according to the 1988 radiocarbon dating, is no older than AD 1260.Stephen E.

Béla, Croatian: Bela III., Slovak: Belo III) (c. 1148 – 23 April 1196) was King of Hungary and Croatia (1172–1196). [Reign 4 March 1172 – 23 April 1196. Coronation 13 January 1173] He was educated in the court of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I  [1118-80] who was planning to ensure his succession in the Byzantine Empire till the birth of his own son. ... In the beginning of 1166, Manuel I and Béla co-chaired the synod of the Byzantine Church in Constantinople\" (\"Béla III of Hungary,\" Wikipedia, 28 May 2012),So I assume that the Pray Manuscript's drawings were probably commissioned by Manuel I as a gift to Bela III, upon his accession to the Hungarian throne, in 1172-73.---------------------------------->Interesting to read of his very strong connections with Constantinople (he was educated there, and married a Byzantium woman). He was in fact lined up to be Emperor, but this was changed when the Emperor finally had a son.Yes. It's not hard to imagine that allowing a Hungarian artist to depict the Shroud symbolically was an appropriate consolation gift from Manuel I to Bela III.Berkovitz (1969) noted that the Pray Manuscript drawings on her plates III & IV \"show close stylistic relationship to ... some figures of the sculptor of Pecs known as the Master of the Nativity\" (p.20), who on p.18 she said sculpted \"the Sampson Scenes\" (1140-1150).\">Bela III fostered relations with Constantinople and \"invited religous orders and scholars from abroad to settle in the country\" (From \"The Church and Bela III of Hungary (1172 - 1196): the Role of Archbishop Likacs of Esztergom\")>This provides further backing for the claim that the images in the Pray Manuscript were influenced by a viewing of the Shroud in Constantinople. In fact, could the images have been drawn by one of the foreign scholars, perhaps from Constantinople? The fact that the Pray Manuscript is the first written Hungarian document supports the notion of a foreign creator or protagonist.Agreed.>I found Bela's history interesting, as I didn't know of the very strong Constantinople connection.See above for my previous comment on 31 May.There is more about Bela III in genealogist Noel Currer-Briggs' \"The Holy Grail and the Shroud of Christ\" (1984), \"The Shroud and the Grail\" (1988), and \"Shroud Mafia\" (1995).

Therefore the following references are only to Currer-Briggs, N., \"The Holy Grail and the Shroud of Christ\" (1984).King Bela III of Hungary's first wife was Agnes de Chatillon (p.72). Their daughter Mary Margaret married Byzantine Emperor Isaac Angelos in 1185 (p.60) and they had a son Kalojan (p.73).Bela III's second wife was Marguerite, daughter of Louis VII of France, and widow of Henry II of England's eldest son Henry Courtmantel (1155-) (p.54). The reign of Bela III (1172-1196) was a glorious period in the history of Hungary (p.73). His family relations assured him a high place in the hierarchy of European monarchs (p.73). He would have been aware of the nature and extent of the collection of relics at Constantinople (p.73). During his reign French influence in Hungary reached its highest point.\" (pp.73-74).The widowed Mary-Margaret married Boniface de Montferrat, a leader of the crusaders who sacked Constantinople in 1204 (p.72). He was given the Kingdom of Salonica, which included northern Greece (p.72). They left Constantinople in 1204 taking much of the imperial treasure with them, which may have included the Shroud (pp.72-73). They later had a son, Demetrios (p.73).The again widowed Mary-Margaret married Nicholas de Saint-Omer, a relative of Godfrey de Saint-Omer, one of the founders of the Knights Templar (p.72). They had two sons, Bela and William de Saint-Omer (p.73). Nicholas died in 1212 and in 1222, Mary-Margaret was driven into exile with her sons, taking refuge in Hungary at the Court of her brother King Andrew II (p.73). He appointed her eldest son Kalojan the Duke of Sirmium (p.73).King Bela III's daughter, ex-Empress Mary-Margaret, provides the link between Constantinople, Hungary, the Templars [and France-my addition].

I am in question to the circles having any relation to the 3 circles of the esophagus or to the poker holes on the Shroud.It's sarcophagus. An esophagus is the tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach!But I agree it is speculative that the pattern of 4 and 3 circles to the left and right of the Mandylion over the arch in the Sakli church, Goreme, Turkey represent the `poker holes' on the Mandylion/Shroud, yet nevertheless, in the absence of a more plausible explanation, I believe that they do. >Reason; there is no logic in it. If the artist was depicting the poker holes; WHy not depict them exactly as are seen? and why 3 holes? Even with the faintest of the poker holes, atleast 4 burns can be seen and why angled? There IS logic in it. If the Mandylion' protective surround at that time had that pattern of 4 and 3 circles on it, then the Sakli fresco artist would have faithfully represented it. And then the logic of the Mandylion's protective surround having a pattern of 4 and 3 circles on it would be to symbolically represent all the patterns of the `poker holes' on the Shroud. Which, looking at them on ShroudScope (Durante 2002 Vertical) the major holes are patterns of 4 and 3:   *    *   *    ** *    * *   *    *   *    *   *    *Within the limited space between the Mandylion's border (and between the Sakli church's arch and ceiling), a pattern of 4 and 3 circles would be a reasonable artistic compromise to depict the poker holes on the Shroud.I also made the point in a comment under \"My critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey,\" part 1: \"Introduction\"\" that the Sakli church is in the centre of Turkey and it may have been important to depict the `poker holes' as a reminder to Christians of the triumph of the Shroud in over the Islamic `trial by fire' in AD 680.>...this theory also would propose the artist had seen the Shroud 'unfurled' and not folded as the Mandylion/Edessa cloth was described and known to exist. No. He may have only been faithfully depicting a pattern of circles on the Mandylion's protective surround, which in turn were based on the actual poker hole burns on the Shroud.>The link to the Constantine 3 holed esophagus in Jerusalem seems too far reaching. If so, then why the need or meaning to the four holes? Agreed that that may be an unnecessary refinement.>My thoughts are that the artist may have known that the Edessa cloth/Mandylion was actually a larger sindon (burial cloth) but had not neccesarily seen it as such, as it can be supposed most people would not have been able too, just a few of the higher clerics, nobles etc; but he was aware of it's distinctive folding.

I am only a high school maths teacher but I thought that 1 + 1 = 2!>i.e; The poster who questions the authenticity of the Shroud due to misinterpretation of scripture.Some Christians (to whom the saying \"a little knowledge is a dangerous thing\" applies) think that they can resolve all Biblical issues using their English translation. As the old parishioner said to the young clergyman who wanted to introduce a newer translation: \"If the King James Version was good enough for St. Paul, young man, then it's good enough for me\"!But English Bible translations often mask nuances in the original language in the interests of English readability, popular appeal, tradition, etc. To find out what a particular original Greek or Hebrew word really means, one needs to consult Greek-English or Hebrew-English lexicons.But even checking in an English translation what the other gospels say about the same incident can reveal things aren't quite as simple as they appeared to be in only one gospel.And then there are those examples of one gospel mentioning one angel/demoniac/blind beggar and another gospel mentioning two angels/demoniacs/blind beggars. If a Christian throws out the shroud on the grounds that a gospel mentions two burial cloths, then to be consistent he/she should throw out the gospel(s) which mention only one angel/demoniac/blind beggar! Well-meaning, devout, but ignorant Christians can, without realising it, be \"fighting against God,\" just as well-meaning, devout, but ignorant Jews were in the first century (and still are today): Acts 5:34-39. \"But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ... addressed them: `Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. ... I advise you: ... Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.'\">John never states the body was wrapped in Othonia (cloths plural), he only states he SAW the othonia (cloths plural) in the tomb. There is a huge difference between the two. When John mentions othonia, it could mean several things; The Shroud itself and bound by strip(s) (As hypothesized by Dr. Jackson) or there could have been more cloths involved lying there.I don't disagree. But in first century Jewish burials the minimum burial cloths were:1) the corpse's hands, feet and jaw were tied with linen bandages (Gk. keiras as mentioned in Lazarus' burial in Jn 11:44) to keep them in place until rigor mortis set in. 2) Then the body was enfolded in a large linen sheet or sindon (Mt 27:59; Mk 15:46; Lk 23:53). Jewish corpses were not totally wrapped around with bandages or strips as Egyptian mummies were. But apparently sometimes a Jewish body was buried in his/her clothes, which may have been the case with Lazarus, since no sindon is mentioned and yet he would have been naked when he emerged from the tomb if he wasn't covered in a sheet or was in his clothes. We don't know what Lazarus died of, but if it was an infectious disease, it is more likely he would have been buried in his clothes to minimise the chance of catching the disease.[continued]","date":"July 12, 2012 at 5:47 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/according-to-john-chapter-20-jesus-was.html","title":"`according to John chapter 20, Jesus was wrapped in linen cloths (plural) ...

It had previously been thought that the jaw band was the soudarion, because it was \"around\" \" (Gk. peri) Lazarus' head but \"upon\" (Gk. epi) Jesus' head (Jn 11:44; 20:7). But watch the video \"Shroud Report Interview with Mark Guscin on the Sudarium of Oviedo\"  to see what the soudarion really was and how it was used in the case of Jesus. As can be seen in the case of Jesus, the soudarion was evidently removed if the body was enfolded in a shroud, but in the case of those who were buried in their clothes, like Lazarus may have been, the soudarion may have been more elaborate (which is indicated by the different Gk prepositions) and left on, since otherwise there would have been nothing covering his face.All the above linen graveclothes were collectively referred to as othonia - \"linen\" (plural).>It has been suggested another large cloth was (needed)or used, to actually carry Jesus from the cross to the tomb, and I think this is evident in that if the Shroud was used to carry the lord from the cross, it would be very evident on the Shroud itself, and it is definately not, meaning there could have been a number of other cloths in the tomb amongst the Sudarium and the Shroud...There could have been, but because of Judaism's law about a bleeding body must be buried with its lifeblood:\"Lazarus died a natural death. In accordance with normal Jewish practice he would have been washed, interred fully dressed in his Sabbath best, tied up with a few binding strips to keep his jaw and limbs suitably together, and provided with some kind of face cloth for screening purposes. Jesus, in contrast, died a very bloody death, and stark naked, his clothes having been removed from him at the time of his crucifixion. [Matthew 27:35, Mark 15:24, Luke 23:34, John 19:23] In his case Jewish law prescribed something very different. As has been carefully explained by Jewish-born Victor Tunkel of the Faculty of Laws, Queen Mary College, University of London, the belief among the Pharisees of Jesus's time, shared by Jesus's own followers, was that everyone's body would be physically resurrected at the end of time. This meant that as far as humanly possible everything that formed part of that body, including particularly the life-blood, should be buried with it. As expressed in the Jewish Code of Laws, `One who fell [e.g. in battle] and died instantly, if ... blood flowed from the wound, and there is apprehension that the blood of the soul was absorbed in his clothes, he should not be cleansed.' ... In these circumstances, therefore, those preparing the dead person for burial had to wrap a `sheet which is called a sovev' straight over any clothes, however bloodstained. This sovev had to be an all-enveloping cloth, that is a `single sheet ... used to go right round' the entire body. Such a sovev readily corresponds to the `over the head' characteristics of Turin's Shroud.\" (Wilson, I., \"The Shroud,\" 2010, p.52)it is more likely that the Shroud did double-duty in being used in carrying Jesus otherwise naked body to the tomb and then used to finally enfold Him with His life-blood in the tomb.>So basically this argument is mute to the discussion of the authenticity of the Shroud.I would put it more strongly. It is both ILLOGICAL and WRONG to claim that there is any contradiction between \"Jesus was wrapped in linen cloths (plural) and had a separate cloth wrapped around his head\" and ONE of those \"linen cloths (plural)\" being a sindon - the Shroud.Stephen E.

As discussed in my post above, the major apparent differences between the gospel accounts of Jesus' resurrection is the number of angels/young men. But the Pray Codex does not attempt to reconcile this.As stated in my post above, the Pray Codex artist is only depicting the scene in Mk 16:1-6 where the three women (Mary Magdalene; Mary the mother of the James, and Salome) came to finish the anointing of the body of Jesus but were told by an angel that Jesus was not there and had risen.>As per John, he shows both the face cloth and the linen body cloth (Shroud).Disagree that this Pray Codex is \"as per John.\" The events being depicted in the lower scene of plate III (Berkovitz, 1969) are those in Mk 15:1-6 where Mary Magdalene, as one of the three women, is told by an angel that Jesus had risen.Mary Magdalene's account of this is briefly mentioned in Jn 20:1-2:\"1 Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. 2 So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, `They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.'\"But as can be seen John does not mention the other women or the angel. That there were other women with Mary Magdalene is not contradicted by John as he records her saying, \"WE do not know where they have laid him.\" But there is no mention of the discarded graveclothes in John's version of her account.In that part of John's account which does mention the discarded graveclothes, Jn 20:3-8:\"3 So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. 4 Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. 5 And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths [Gk. othonia] lying there, 7 and the face cloth [Gk. soudarion], which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. 8 Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;\"the women and angel are not mentioned, only Peter and John (\"the other disciple\").[continued]","date":"July 19, 2012 at 10:40 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/according-to-john-chapter-20-jesus-was.html","title":"`according to John chapter 20, Jesus was wrapped in linen cloths (plural) ...

Freeman acknowledges this to be the sudarium. It is the right size to be the face cloth, and further support for it being this rather than the Shroud is provided by the symbolic connection depicted by the letter (alpha?) floating between the cross and Jesus's head behind the right arm of Mary.Agree that it is \"Jesus's head behind the right arm of Mary\" and as you rightly indicate \"the letter (alpha?)\" is ambiguous.But disagree with Freeman (and you) that:\"The most important point of all is that a blown-up image shows that the sudarium is depicted as a separate piece of cloth and so the source seems, once again, to be the account in John's gospel where the sudarium is reported as lying separately.\" [pages 17 & 18]See previously that Freeman (and you) is simply WRONG that \"the source seems ... to be the account in John's gospel.\" And I have Berkovits, 1969, plate III, in front of me, and even under a magnifying glass there is NO \"small bundled object, to the right of the angel's foot and the cross motifs.\" In fact Freeman doesn't even say that, just vaguely that \"a blown-up image shows that the sudarium is depicted as a separate piece of cloth,\" without stating where it is.And as previously stated the \"sudarium\" (Gk. soudarion), and indeed the graveclothes, are not mentioned in Mk 15:1-6, the \"Visit to the Sepulchre\" by the three women.Even if he was trying to reconcile the scene in Mk 15:1-6, with the other gospel accounts of the discovery of the empty tomb, the 12th century Hungarian Pray Codex artist would be most unlikely to know what we know today, that the soudarion of Jn 20:7 is the Sudarium of Oviedo. That was in Spain, in a chest, in an obscure cathedral in an obscure town, Oviedo. And the Sudarium of Oviedo's connection with the Shroud was only rediscovered in the 1960s.If the artist was trying to depict the soudarion then it would be the strip of linen around the neck of the garment emerging from the empty sarcophagus. Until fairly recently, before the significance of the Sudarium of Oviedo became more widely realised in Shroud pro-authenticity circles, it was wrongly assumed that the \"the face cloth [soudarion], which had been on Jesus' head\" in Jn 20:7 was a strip of linen which in Jewish burials was tied around the top of the head and the chin to keep the mouth from falling open until rigor mortis had set in.>Then the Shroud is the object beneath the face cloth, with the 4 poker holes, streaks of blood, and cross motifs symbolising the image of Jesus on the Shroud.Disagree. There is no \"face cloth\" depicted in the LOWER scene on plate III, unless it is the strip around the neck of the garment emerging from the sarcophagus. In the LOWER scenw of plate III, the Shroud is depicted as the sarcophagus, decorated with the \"4 poker holes, streaks of blood, and cross motifs\" and Jesus' face in profile near Mary Magdalene's right arm.  The \"image of Jesus on the Shroud\" is depicted in the UPPER scene of plate III.Matt, as previously mentioned, we are going around in circles on this. I don't want to waste my time arguing the same point endlessly. Yet I feel I must counter what I consider to be wrong information posted on my blog. Therefore you have had your final comment under this post on this matter about the sudarium being depicted on the Pray Codex.If I feel I have to, to save me wasting my time on endless debates, I will reluctantly reestablish my policy that:\"Each individual will usually be allowed only one comment under each post.

The Jesus Seminar scholars say much the same thing.And 1) highlights a major problem with the Internet. Anyone can say anything and if they sound authoritative enough, most readers don’t have the means to check it out in depth for themselves. In the end you have to read books and journal article on any topic to fully master it, just as you would have to if you were doing a university degree. When I did my Biology degree in 2000-04, the lecturers emphasised that Internet only articles (i.e. that were not copies of journals or books) were not acceptable as scholarly references for assignments and papers. For what its worth, I own and have mostly read about 120 books on the Shroud, not counting hundreds of articles.When I get to “4. History of the Shroud,” in my PowerPoint presentation-based series “Shroud of Turin: Burial sheet of Jesus!” I will outline the historical evidence of the Shroud going back to the 1st century, with references, so readers can have some basis to make up their own minds.","date":"February 4, 2012 at 8:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/04/calling-all-history-buffs-interesting-comments-from-yannick-clment/","cat":"history","title":"Calling all history buffs: Interesting comments from Yannick Clément"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">>there is no clear proofs that the Shroud of Turin was really present anywhere.>This is false, but it would take a huge amount of time and space for me to prove it, and even then I doubt that Yannick would accept it.I later remembered that Ian Wilson had also presented empirical evidence that the Mandylion was the Shroud folded in eight (doubled over and then folded four times), with the top eighth being the face of the Shroud in landscape mode:“For me a crucial breakthrough in overcoming this objection surfaced in the 1960s, when I noticed how a sixth-century Greek version of the Abgar story, the Acts of the Holy Apostle Thaddaeus’, describes the Edessa cloth as a tetradiplon. In all the corpus of Greek literature tetradiplon is an extremely rare word, and totally exclusive to the Edessa cloth. Yet, because it is a combination of two common words, tetra meaning `four’ and diplon meaning `two fold’ or `doubled’, its meaning is actually very clear: `doubled in four’, suggesting four times two folds. This immediately raised the thought: `What happens if you try giving the Shroud four times two folds?’ When I tried this, using a full-length photograph of the Shroud, I was dumb-founded by the result – as I continue to be today. There was the Shroud face, front-facing and disembodied-looking on a landscape aspect cloth, exactly as on the earliest artists’ copies of the cloth of Edessa. Whenever the Shroud is presented in this manner – and it is a very logical way to present and make manageable a 437 cm length of cloth – its nature as a `shroud’ is in fact subordinated to its rather more socially acceptable nature as a `portrait’. And historically such an arrangement finds ready support in the description of the Edessa cloth, on its arrival in Constantinople, as `fastened to a board and covered with the gold which is now to be seen’.  It therefore readily explains the many centuries of silence about an image-bearing `shroud’ as such. Furthermore, when the man of the Shroud’s eyes are viewed on the cloth itself, as the Edessans and Constantinopolitans might have viewed them, rather than on the photographic negative that we tend to be more familiar with today, they appear open and staring, just as if he was alive, thus readily corresponding to this aspect of the Abgar story. … Clearly a crucial component of this theory is that the Shroud should bear signs of its once having been folded, for some significant length of time, in the ‘doubled in four’ manner postulated. When the STURP team worked on it in 1978, at my urging they specifically included in their test programme raking light photography to show up as clearly as possible the innumerable ancient and not-so-ancient creases that criss-cross its surface. When Dr John Jackson carefully analysed these creases to gauge whether there were any significant and long-established fold-marks consistent with the ‘doubled-in-four’ theory, he found that indeed they were there. He even found that the way they fell, with two particularly pronounced concentrations – one at the level of the topmost part of the back of the head, the other just below the crossed hands – indicated that the cloth had at one time been stored so that, if it was pulled upwards, the imprint of the man of the Shroud would appear to rise up from whatever casket in which it was stored.” (Wilson, I. & Schwortz, B., “The Turin Shroud: The Illustrated Evidence,” Michael O’Mara Books: London, 2000, pp.110-11).See also Dan’s:“Tetradiplon or Doubled in Fours”“The Definitive Shroud of Turin FAQ: Tetradiplon”“Shroud of Turin FAQ: Comment on Wikipedia Text”This is empirical proof beyond reasonable doubt that the Mandylion was the Shroud folded so that the face only is visible.","date":"February 5, 2012 at 3:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/04/calling-all-history-buffs-interesting-comments-from-yannick-clment/","cat":"history","title":"Calling all history buffs: Interesting comments from Yannick Clément"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Steve>I'm eagerly awaiting more in this seriesThanks.

Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.”John 20:5-7 does not say that. An ENGLISH TRANSLATION (NIV) of the Greek of John 20:5-7 says that.The old joke: “if the King James Version” was good enough for St Paul, it is good enough for me” applies. The point is that the New Testament is in Greek and if one wants to make an argument that is based on key words, as this one is (“strips of linen”), then one must find out what the original Greek means.My Interlinear Greek New Testament, renders it more literally:“5 and stooping sees lying the sheets [Gk. othonia], not however he entered. 6 Comes therefore also Simon Peter following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholds the sheets [othonia] lying, 7 and the kerchief [sudarion], which was on the head of  him, not with the sheets [othonia] lying but apart having been wrapped up in.one placeIn this case the key word is othonia which is translated “strips of linen” in one English translations, e.g. NIV.But the word othonia is just the plural of othone] “linen cloth.” So the KJV is more accurate than the NIV, as it renders the word othonia as “linen clothes”:5And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 6Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 7And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. The English Standard Version (ESV), which is regarded as one of the more accurate modern translations, renders othonia as “linen clothes”:5And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 6Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, 7And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Also Lk 23:53 (NIV) refers to Jesus’ body being “wrapped … in linen cloth” (Gk. sindon (singular) a linen sheet:53 Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. andLk 24:12 (NIV) refers to the linen cloths [othonia] (plural), again wrongly translated “strips”:12 Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. So Luke sees no inconsistency between Jesus body being wrapped or enfolded in a large linen sheet [sindon] (singular) and Peter and John finding in Jesus’ empty tomb, “linen cloths” [othonia] (plural).   Therefore, in Jn 20:5-7, John, like Luke, by othonia is referrring to the linen cloths (plural), which included the large linen sheet sindon, and the smaller bandages keiria (Jn 11:44) which in Jewish burials bound the hands, feet and jaw, fr example, in the case of the raising of Lazarus, which the NIV inconsistently translates this different Greek work also as “strips of linen”:Jn 11:44 The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen [keiria], and a cloth around his face [soudarion].  Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes [keiria] and let him go.Putting it all together, what Peter and John saw in Jesus’ empty tomb, as described by John 20:5-7, was:1. The linen cloths collectively: the Shroud [sindon] and bandages [keiria]; and 2. The “cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head” [soudarion] in a separate place.This is fully consistent with the Shroud of Turin being included in the [othonia] “linen clothes” (KJV & ESV), “linen cloths” (RSV & NKJV), or “linen wrappings” (NASB & NLT), and the Sudarium of Oviedo being the “cloth [soudarion] around his face” (NIV) or “napkin, that was about his head” (ESV).","date":"January 13, 2012 at 9:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/13/have-a-think-about-it-of-linen-strips-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Have a think about it.

Ramm (1916-1992), pointed out that they include \"intellectual riches\" (and \"cultural riches\" too), which are an obstacle to saving faith in Jesus:\"In the Gospels a very wealthy young man refused to make the motions of faith. He was intrigued by Jesus Christ, but when the issue became sharply one of Christ or his possessions, the tug of his possessions was the stronger, and sorrowfully he left Jesus Christ. He wanted religion without the motions of faith. It is not a rash presumption to believe that many scientists and educated men wish for peace of mind, relief from a guilty conscience, hope for the life to come, and the blessedness of faith in God. But they find themselves caught between their science and their religious hopes, unable to move. Being possessed of great intellectual riches which manage to come first in their sentiments, they leave Jesus Christ. Just as Jesus refused to pursue the rich young man and make other terms, so today we cannot lessen or cheapen or alter the terms of the gospel for our men of science. There is no other Saviour than Jesus Christ, and there is no other means of having Him than by the motions of repentance and faith. Therefore, if a scientist comes to God he must come in the same way as any other person comes to God. He must make the appropriate spiritual motions. He must repent; he must confess his sin to God; he must believe in Jesus Christ with all his heart.\" (Ramm, B.L., 1955, \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture,\" p.245).Jesus also added at the end of His parable above, that those who are prepared to give up their \"great possessions\" to gain Him, \"will receive a hundredfold\" in this life \"and will inherit eternal life\" as well!

I will make the appropriate minor correction. It still could be near the \"Anthon\" in which Aymon IV and Jeanne lived with the Shroud. And far from it being \"not associated with Aimon de Genève,\"as I wrote (does Farey have a reading problem?), it says the chateau was built in 1315 by \"Guichard d'Anthon.\" As I wrote, presumably that was Guichard VI d'Anthon (c. 1278-1320), who was Aymon IV's great uncle. And Aymon's mother Isabelle d'Anthon (c.1307-1335), did inherit Guichard VI's lands and titles through her father, Aymar d'Anthon (1286-1325).So most of the alleged \"mistakes\"  Farey raised were either Farey's own mistakes or debatable.

One conclusion is that the Shroud is a diabolical, intricate fake. It was designed by some Medieval forger who could predict how scholars, in a variety of fields, centuries hence, would seek authenticity, using features no Medieval audience would require or even accept – for example, Jesus’ nudity and nail marks through the wrists, rather than the hands. The other conclusion is that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. *That* conclusion is so stunning, so truly terrifying in its implications, that the intelligent person, while intrigued and delighted by the Shroud’s mysterious features, struggles to find conclusive evidence that the Shroud cannot possibly be what it very much appears to be. In any case, the evidence to support either conclusion is finite. If you read this book, or Mark Antonacci’s book, or any number of other publications on the Shroud, you will be going over similar intellectual terrain. You will read of neutron flux, the sacking of Constantinople, the Knights Templar, and the peculiarities of Jerusalem’s flora. As an artist, Wilson pays more attention to artist Isabel Piczek’s theories than other authors have — and that is a very good thing — but, otherwise, Shroud fans will have read about much of this material before. What set Ian Wilson’s book apart for me was the author’s style. Amidst the hard evidence, Wilson was willing to give us his own subjective response to seeing the Shroud for the first time. Wilson was willing to quote others’ astounded reactions as well. Wilson wrote of scholars whose theories he does not accept with wit and graciousness. He was also willing to share with those of us outside Shroud politics the ins and outs of the Shroud world’s gossip and infighting. For these reasons of style, humanity, humility, and humor, Wilson’s is my favorite Shroud book so far. I like it that he doesn’t allow the pressure to prove the Shroud’s value via hard science to silence his humanity. Wilson strikes me as a wonderful chap; reading his book, I wished I could be discussing the Shroud with him in person in a pub somewhere in the soggy English countryside.","date":"January 17, 2012 at 6:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/17/paper-chase-danusha-goskas-untitled-essay/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Danusha Goska’s Untitled Essay"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"DanThanks for the plugs.

As I stated in my post above:\"Its first known occurrence is in the sixth century Acts of Thaddeus, an update of an earlier story about Edessa's King Abgar V (c. 4 BC-AD 50) receiving an image of Jesus imprinted on a \"four doubled\" (tetradiplon) linen sheet (sindon):\"It was the earlier Doctrine of Addai which `explained' that the image was imprinted on the cloth when Jesus wiped His face on it.The Acts of Thaddeus updated this with the 6th century discovery that the cloth was a four-doubled (tetradiplon large linen sheet (sindon).I have revised my post above to make this clearer:\"Its [tetradiplon's] first known occurrence is in the Acts of Thaddeus, a sixth century update of an earlier (c. AD 400) story in the Doctrine of Addai, about Edessa's King Abgar V (c. 4 BC-AD 50) receiving an image of Jesus imprinted on a cloth. The sixth century Acts of Thaddeus added new information to that earlier story that the cloth was a sindon (a large linen sheet) which was tetradiplon (\"four doubled\"):\"The Acts of Thaddeus did not challenge the earlier Doctrine of Addai's `explanation' how Jesus' image came to be imprinted on the cloth.Presumably, if the writer of the Acts of Thaddeus knew that it was not only the image of Jesus' face which was on the cloth, but that of His whole body, naked, tortured, bloodstained and dead, he was not at liberty to write that.Those among the Edessan clergy who knew that shocking new information would have a powerful vested interest to withhold it from the Edessan public, to whom it would be profoundly disturbing.Therefore it is not surprising that the Edessan clergy would maintain the traditional story about how the image was imprinted on the cloth, while permitting the writer of the Acts of Thaddeus to update it with the new information about the cloth itself, that it was a sindon (a large linen sheet), and that it was tetradiplon (four-doubled). >Can you explain how it could be a shroud?See above.Stephen E.

With his image imprinted upon the towel, Jesus gave it to Ananias and t[o] Thaddeus to guide the king and the cityAgreed that the sixth century Acts of Thaddeus, story of Jesus leaving an image of Himself on a towel by washing His face on it is false. As I wrote above, it was an Edessan explanation of how and why Jesus' image was on the Mandylion (the Shroud of Turin \"doubled in four\" - Gk tetradiplon), to maintain consistency with Edessa's earlier Doctrine of Addai story of Edessa's 1st century King Abgar receiving from Jesus His image on a towel. Which in turn is probably an earlier conflation of Jesus' letter to Abgar I, which is in Eusebius' 4th century Ecclesiastical History, and an earlier (at least 4th century and possibly even 1st century) knowledge of Jesus' image on the Mandylion/Shroud.That in the sixth century the unique in all of known ancient Greek literature word tetradiplon tetra \"four\" + diplon \"doubled\" = \"four-doubled\") was used of a cloth with Jesus' facial image on is proof beyond reasonable doubt that there was known in at least the sixth century to be a cloth with Jesus' image on which was one-eighth of a larger cloth. This can only be what we now call the Shroud of Turin, which when folded in eight shows Jesus face in landscape aspect, exactly as it appears in early copies of the Mandylion.>The Shroud is a 14 foot long burial cloth but it has the image of Jesus on it (very faint actually).

It is based on the Mandylion (never made by human hands -- therefore not an icon)Agreed. The name \"Veronica\" is a combination of Latin vera \"true\" and ikon \"image\" = \"true image\", and therefore shows that the story of a woman named Veronica receiving Jesus' image on a towel she gave Him to wash his face with was false. But historians take ancient legends seriously as probably being based on facts. In this case that there was known to be an early (pre-4th century) image of Jesus, or at least of His face, on cloth.>The Mandylion (the Shroud) was often described as a facial image because it was displayed as folded (not the full length) and that is where the story of a face cloth came.Agreed.

AD 400)  Doctrine of Addai.That `explanation' pre-dates the Shroud being at Edessa (AD 526), and is more evidence for Markwardt's theory that the Shroud was in Antioch from c. AD 47-526, and hidden above Antioch's Gate of the Cherubim from c. AD 326-526.The sixth century Acts of Thaddeus did not change the earlier story of how the image was imprinted on the cloth, but it did add new information about the cloth itself, that it was a large linen sheet (sindon) which was four-doubled (tetradiplon), i.e. folded in eight.That presumably means that some in the Edessan clergy leadership became aware of the full-length cloth under the top face panel.Although it is possible they could see that the cloth was four-doubled in profile from the edge of the frame, without them actually having unfastened the cloth from its frame, unfolding it and looking at the image of Jesus' naked, bloodstained, crucified and dead body.>At what point was the truth revealed? In 944 or later?There seems to be no unambiguous record of when it was discovered that behind the Image of Edessa's face image was the full-length Shroud. The first definite reference was in 1130:\"All this makes all the more intriguing the evidence that someone, sometime after the Mandylion's arrival in Constantinople, seems to have undone the gold trelliswork covering the cloth, untwined the fringe from the surrounding nails, carefully unfolded the cloth, and, for the first time since the days of the apostles, set eyes on the concealed full-length figure. Frustratingly, this is another of those moments in the Mandylion's history that has gone unrecorded, yet is crucial to it. It is attested as a real happening from an impressive array of circumstantial evidence. The first indications, and the most direct, come from western authors. The earliest, datable to sometime before 1130, is an interpolation in an original eighth-century sermon by Pope Stephen III. [von Dobschutz, E., Christusbilder, Leipzig, 1889, p, 134] Referring to the Mandylion, it tells us: `For the very same mediator between God and man [Christ], that he might in every way satisfy the king [Abgar], stretched his WHOLE BODY ON A CLOTH, white as snow, on which the glorious image of the Lord's face and the LENGTH OF HIS WHOLE BODY was so divinely transformed that it was sufficient for those who could not see the LORD BODILY IN THE FLESH, to see the transfiguration made on the cloth.' [Green, M., \"Enshrouded in Silence,\" Ampleforth Journal, LXXIV, 1969, p.333]\" (Wilson, I., \"The Shroud of Turin: The Burial Cloth of Jesus?,\" 1979, pp.157-158.

According to this version: `Abgar reigned as toparch of Edessa. To him the Lord Jesus sent ... a most precious cloth with which he wiped the sweat from his face, and on which shone the Savior's features miraculously reproduced. This displayed to those who gazed on it the likeness and proportions of the BODY OF THE LORD.' [Ordericus Vitalis, Historia ecclesiastica, part III, bk. IX, 8]\" (Wilson, 1979, p.158).\"A Vatican Library codex, also datable to the twelfth century, repeated this tradition in its version of Christ's letter to Abgar: `If indeed you desire to look bodily upon my face, I send you a cloth on which know that the image not only of my face, but of my WHOLE BODY had been divinely transformed.' [Vatican Library Codex No. 5696, fol. 35, published in P. Savio, Ricerche storlche sulla Santa Sindone, Turin, 1957, footnote 31. p. 340]\" (Wilson, 1979, p.158).\"By the thirteenth century, Gervase of Tilbury, a great retailer of the gossip of the time, not only repeated these words of Christ to Abgar, but added: `Far it is handed down from archives of ancient authority that the Lord prostrated himself FULL LENGTH on most white linen, and so by divine power the most beautiful likeness not only of the face, but also of the WHOLE BODY OF THE LORD was impressed upon the cloth.' [Gervase of Tilbury, Otia Imperialia, III, from Scriptores rerum brunsvicensium, ed. G. Leibnitz, Hanover, 1707, I, pp. 966-67]\" (Wilson, 1979, p.159).While these may seem late, they are only the earliest surviving records of the discovery in Constantinople after 944 that behind Jesus' face image was His full-length, whole body image. It may have been discovered not long after the Image/Shroud arrived in Constantinople in 944, but it was either not recorded or that recording was lost.Whichever, this lack of any Constantinople document recording the discovery of Jesus' full-length, naked, bloodstained, crucified and dead body under His face image, is further evidence of how shocking this was to the Byzantine mindset. And helps explain that if the Edessan ruling clergy were aware of it from 526, why they kept it a closely guarded secret.And even though these 1130+ references are at least 186 years after the Image/Shroud arrived in Constantinople, they are still at least 130 years before the earliest possible radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, 1260.Stephen E.

And that Joseph had to buy the linen cloth in a hurry, because “the Sabbath was about to begin” (Lk 23:54).Therefore it is entirely possible and consistent with the Biblical evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin was intended, not for a burial shroud, but for clothing, as Hoare pointed out:“While the exact time and place of manufacture are uncertain, there can be no doubt that the Shroud is a beautifully made length of cloth, and probably cost a very great deal.

It seems apparent that the cloth’s loom width was reduced by cutting it near one edge and reattaching the selvedge. I missed this before. The evidence now is that there is no side strip. That is because xrays taken by STURP in 1978 show that the weave is continuous throughout both the Shroud and the `side strip’. The `seam’ is now thought to be a folded and sewn “cord” to pass a  thin rope or wire through or to otherwise help support the holding of the Shroud during displays. Here are quotes to that effect. “The radiograph … suggests that the side strip either is, or at least was, at one time an integral portion of the full cloth. In this particular area, there are alternating high- and low-material-density `bands’ that evidently correspond to weft lots of different weight used in the weaving. (The visible-light transmission photographs of Schwortz also clearly show these structures.) … The distinct weft structure is continuous across the seam joining the two panels and strongly suggests that the side strip and the main section were of a single manufacture.” (Schwalbe, L.A. & Rogers, R.N., 1982, “Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin: Summary of the 1978 Investigation,” Analytica Chimica Acta, Vol. 135, No. 1, pp.3-49, pp.41-42).“This side strip is made from the same twilled cloth of the Shroud, of which it originally formed part; in fact, the irregularities of the weave, clearly visible in the principal section, extend exactly to the side strip, as can be seen from the radiographies carried out in 1978 and published by Schwalbe and Rogers. [Analytica Chimica Acta, 135, 1982, p.42]” (Petrosillo, O. & Marinelli, E., 1996, “The Enigma of the Shroud,” p.162).“Schwalbe and Rogers [Schwalbe, L. & Rogers, R., “Physics and Chemistry of the Shroud of Turin; A Summary of the 1978 Investigation”, Anal. Chim Acta, 135, 1982, pp. 3-49], mainly on the continuity of various macroscopically observable patterns seen in the weave in the radiograph images [Mottern, R., London, R. & Morris, R., “Radiographic Examination of the Shroud of Turin; A Preliminary Report”, Materials Eval., 38, 1979, pp. 39-44] taken during the STURP investigations, rejected the possibility of an adventitious piece of cloth for the side strip and concluded that the two pieces of cloth were actually continuous through the seam. .” (Adler, A.D., 1998, “Concerning the Side Strip on the Shroud of Turin,” in Adler, A.D. & Crispino, D., ed., “The Orphaned Manuscript,” 2002, pp.87-91, p.87).“There are three possibilities as to the nature of the side strip: 1) it is a completely different piece of linen cloth which has been joined to one edge of the Shroud for some unknown purpose; 2) it is a piece of the original cloth of the Shroud which for some unknown reason became detached from the original and was then reattached by the seam; 3) it is cloth that is continuous with the rest of the Shroud and the seam is really a tuck or a tube that has been sewn into the cloth for some unknown purpose. … Of our three original possibilities, situation 1 is clearly rejected and situation 2 also seems highly unlikely in view of the detailed thread matching that would be required and the absence of any evidence of any frayed thread ends along either side of the seam image. Therefore we conclude that the side strip is actually continuous with the rest of the Shroud.” (Adler, 1998, pp.87-88).“Several authors have suggested that the purpose of a corded side seam might be to facilitate hanging the cloth for exhibition. Certainly many paintings of such medieval exhibitions show the Shroud being displayed in such a manner with the cloth shown along its length and held or suspended along what would appear to be the side seam. It should be noted that this mode of display places maximum stress at the end points of suspension and tearing of the fabric would be expected to proceed from the ends inward along the seam. Some historical accounts record that certain noteworthies were given pieces of the Shroud. It would be logical to assume that such samples would be taken from such torn end panels, thus providing a simple explanation for the missing panel portions of the side strip. Perhaps the Charny family decided to repair such damages at the time of their display of the Shroud. Maybe the radiocarbon sample is simply rewoven material from the time of this repair. Had the recommended protocol for taking this sample been followed [Adler, A., 1996, “Updating Recent Studies on the Shroud of Turin,” Orna, M.V., ed., ACS Symp. Series, 625, pp. 223-228], we would have an answer for these questions.” (Adler, 1998, pp.87-91)“One final mystery element of the fabric is what appears to be a seam line three and a half inches from the Shroud’s edge (as seen to the left of the frontal image when viewed face on), that runs the cloth’s full length. It is from inside this seam line that the Shroud’s two missing portions have been removed at its two ends, but what is as yet still far from clear is the exact function of the seam itself, if that is indeed what it is. Before the STURP examination of 1978 I had hypothesised that the three-and-a-half-inch-wide strip of cloth which the seam appears to join to the main body of the Shroud was a ‘side-strip’ added close to the time of its original manufacture, perhaps in order to balance the appearance of the image on the cloth, since only by its addition does the body image appear central. But then in 1978 X-radiographs made by the STURP team showed that the same weft-run could be traced through from the original Shroud into the side-strip, suggesting that the cloth had been made as a single piece, with the seam being just that, a seam. However, if that was the case, why on earth had anyone gone to all the trouble of very carefully cutting off a three-and-a-half-inch strip, only then equally carefully to sew it back on again?” (Wilson, I., 1998, “The Blood and the Shroud,” 1998, p.72).Stephen","date":"March 11, 2010 at 9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/02/02/the-gibson-study-really-says-nothing-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"The Gibson Study Really Says Nothing About the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"John>Flury-Lemberg confirmed the cloth was cut and sewn together. … Flury-Lemberg made this report at the Symposium at Turin, March 2-5, 2000. Thanks for this information.

But Googling on “Turn Shroud: Past, Present and Future” and “seam” I found a report (which I already had on my computer but had forgotten) on this in the BSTS Newsletter of June 2000: “By far the most important information to come from Dr. Flury-Lemberg, however, concerns how the Shroud had been woven and finished. As she pointed out, looms in antiquity, particularly those in Egypt, could be up to 3.5 metres wide, enabling them to turn out continuous lengths of cloth far longer and wider than the Shroud. The high quality of the Shroud’s weaving strongly suggests it to have been made on a ‘professional’ loom of this kind. The explanation of its side-strip would therefore seem to be that at the time of its manufacture it formed part of considerably wider cloth which was then cut lengthwise into at least three pieces, two wide, and one narrow, this latter being the side-strip, which retains selvedge along its length, just as does its opposite number. With the central section removed (and now lost without trace), the wide and narrow pieces were very expertly joined up to form the Shroud as we know it today, this thereby clearly having been made to conform to specific dimensions.” (Wilson, I., “`The Turin Shroud – past, present and future’, Turin, 2-5 March, 2000 – probably the best-ever Shroud Symposium,” British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter, No. 51, June 2000).That Google search also found another article:“First, we examined the so-called side strip and its seam, about which there have been questions and disagreement. In 1982 after studying the radiographs taken in 1978, Schwalbe and Rogers reported that there is continuity of the threads from the Shroud into the side strip and concluded that the Shroud and the side strip are of one piece. (Ref.: Schwalbe & Rogers, 1982) We studied the same area also, trying to discern whether the side strip is 1) a completely different piece of linen which had been joined to the edge of the Shroud, 2) a piece of the original Shroud which had been detached but was then carefully reattached by the seam, or 3) an integral, continuous part of the Shroud fabric with the seam being really a tuck in the cloth for some reason. A joint paper, `Concerning the Side Strip on the Shroud of Turin,’ (Ref.: Adler et al, 1997) was presented at the May 1997 Nice Symposium in which we reported our findings from tracing several thousand of some 15,000 weft threads from the body of the Shroud through the seam and into the side strip that there is near-perfect alignment of nearly each thread in position, thickness, and intensity. Also, we found no evidence of frayed thread ends either in the seam or along either side of it. Our conclusion then was that the side strip is continuous with the rest of the Shroud.” (Whanger, A.D. & Whanger, M., 2005, “Excerpt from Radiological Aspects of the Shroud of Turin,” Council for Study of the Shroud of Turin, Durham NC, pp.1-15, p.1)So I stand corrected there is a side strip, it being part of the same cloth and expertly cut and rejoined by a seam at the time of original manufacture, such that each thread is almost perfectly aligned across the two sections.Thanks again for bringing this to my attention.However this raises more problems for your theory that the Shroud is Jesus’ tallit.

She had worked directly with the Shroud as a fabric specialist. She felt that originally the fabric had been cut into three lengthwise strips, two wide and one narrow, and that later the narrow strip (now the side strip) was expertly reattached to one of the wide strips by the seam to produce what we now know as the Shroud. Later, we reexamined the radiographs as well as photographic enlargements of portions of them to get a better understanding of the side strip and the two missing corners (MC) at the frontal and dorsal ends on the anatomic left side of the Shroud. … Following the seam its full length on the Shroud, it is remarkably uniform for almost the entire length except for the two ends near the MC. The weft threads can be traced from the Shroud through the seam continuing into the side strip in near perfect alignment.

According to St Paul, Crossan’s (and his ilk’s) faith is empty of content and he/they are of all men the most to be pitied (1Cor 15:14-19).If this reader REALLY believes what Crossan believes (and I note that he/she does not actually state that), then he might be a Catholic (or a Baptist, or an Anglican, etc), but he/she is NOT a Christian. There are people who believe the Shroud is authentic (like the late Rodney Hoare, a past Chairman of the British Society for the Turin Shroud, who even wrote books defending the Shroud’s authenticity, but who believed Jesus never died on the cross) but who are not Christians.That is OK in Sindonology (“the scientific study of the Shroud of Turin“) but it is NOT OK in Christianity. There are Christians who don’t believe the Shroud is authentic (I was one for nearly 40 years), who are my brothers and sisters in Christ. There are non-Christians (like Barrie Schwortz-owner of Shroud.com) who are my brothers and sisters in the Shroud. But the two brotherhoods are NOT the same.

What is the threshold for perceiving an image? What are the criteria for saying that the image is of a man? Are you an expert on the human face?” .On that basis it would be impossible to decide whether “the Face on Mars” was a representation of a real alien face, or just a rock formation that by coincidence happens to look like a human face.The test, as Dan said, is in the level of detail. The Face on Mars only LOOKED like a face at a low level of resolution and from a certain angle in a 1976 Viking 1 photograph. It was later shown by NASA in 1998, when its Mars Global Surveyor “snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos … the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing [the Face on Mars to be] a natural landform.” So a fake only gets more and more unlike the real thing as the level of detailed scrutiny increases. The Shroud, on the other hand, has only become more and more like the real thing, as the level of scrutiny has increased. Members of the 1978 Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP), like the late Ray Rogers and Barrie Schwortz, were confident that it would only take a short time of their detailed scientific scrutiny, for them to detect that the Shroud was a fake. Yet that that did not happen. After 5 days of the most intensive scientific scrutiny, none of the STURP team, were able to conclude that the Shroud was a fake. And today, a third of a century later, the Shroud continues to only look more and more like the real thing, the very burial sheet of Jesus, bearing the imprint of His crucified, dead, and resurrected body, and less and less like a fake.The only reasonable (and consistent if one believes the Face on Mars is just a rock formation) conclusion, is that the the Shroud is NOT a fake, but is in fact JESUS’ and its image is “a literal `snapshot’ of the Resurrection” (Wilson, I., “The Turin Shroud,” 1978, p.210).","date":"January 30, 2012 at 8:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/30/sciencebods-3d-problem/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Sciencebod’s 3D Problem"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">How do we get a high resolution (focused) image without a converging lens, concave mirror, or even pinhole camera. John Jackson’s Cloth Collapse theory explains how there is a “a one-to-one mapping between a given point on the body to a unique point on the cloth … achieved for all points on the Shroud”:“Image Characteristics explained by Hypothesis Let us now show how this concept explains each of the image characteristics of the Shroud discussed at the beginning of this paper. 1. High Resolution. As various points on the Shroud intersect different topographical features on the body surface during the collapse process, radiation dose on the cloth begins to accumulate. If the radiation is assumed to be strongly absorbed in air, radiation effects on the cloth cannot begin until virtual intersection with the body surface occurs. Thus, a one-to-one mapping between a given point on the body to a unique point on the cloth is achieved for all points on the Shroud, which is equivalent to stating that the resulting image is well resolved.” (Jackson, J.P., “An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image,” in Berard, A., ed., “History, Science, Theology and the Shroud,” Symposium Proceedings, St. Louis Missouri, June 22-23, 1991, The Man in the Shroud Committee of Amarillo, Texas: Amarillo TX, 1991, p.340. Emphasis original).without the need for a converging lens.Jackson’s Cloth Collapse theory also explains every other major characteristic of the Shroud:“Thus, the hypothesis of the Shroud collapsing into a radiating body explains all the above characteristics of the Shroud image, something that other image formation hypotheses posed thus far fail to do. (Jackson, 1991, p.342).Jackson also made a testable prediction of his theory that “the frontal image should reside on both sides of the Shroud, whereas the dorsal image should reside on only one side”:“Testable Predictions of Hypothesis … 2 Surface Discolorations on Both Sides of the Shroud for the Frontal Image. As noted above, the superficial nature of the image is explained by the theory. However, the above reasoning leads to one other prediction concerning the superficiality of the image; the frontal image should reside on both sides of the Shroud, whereas the dorsal image should reside on only one side. The reason is that when the upper part of the Shroud falls into the body region, radiation from the body impinges upon both sides of the cloth. However, in the case of the dorsal image, radiation impinges from only one side because the cloth there never moves into the body. Unfortunately, there are no suitable data available to test this prediction because the reverse side of the Shroud has been covered since 1534 with a backing cloth. But if such a prediction could be confirmed by a future examination of the reverse side, then the theory proposed herein would be given considerable support. It is likely, however, that if a frontal image discoloration exists on the reverse surface of the Shroud, it would be somewhat less intense than the discoloration which is observed on the normal viewing side because that side presumably entered the body first.” (Jackson, 1991, pp.342-343. Emphasis original).Jackson’s prediction was found to be true in 2004 when “The ghostly image of a man’s face” was discovered “on the reverse side of the Shroud” (i.e. what was originally the uppermost side of the Shroud as it lay on Jesus body in the Tomb) which “had a striking 3-D quality and matched the known face in form, size and position”:“The ghostly image of a man’s face has emerged on the reverse side of the Shroud of Turin, the piece of linen believed to have been wrapped around the body of Jesus after he was crucified, scientists say. The discovery, using new digital imaging techniques, adds new complexity to one of the most controversial relics in Christendom. The study, which will be published online ahead of print publication in the Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics, examined the back surface of the famous handwoven linen. … the back side has remained hidden for centuries beneath a piece of so-called Holland cloth … The back surface, however, was photographed in detail and the pictures published in a book by Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti, one of the Church’s top shroud officials. … `As I saw the pictures in the book, I was caught by the perception of a faint image on the back surface of the shroud …’ said Giulio Fanti … the study’s lead author. Imaging the face Fanti used sophisticated image processing based on direct and inverse Fourier transform, enhancement and template-matching techniques on Ghiberti’s pictures to uncover the image of a man’s face. Lying behind the known image of the bearded man bearing the marks of crucifixion, the new image had a striking 3-D quality and matched the known face in form, size and position. `Though the image is very faint, features such as nose, eyes, hair, beard and moustache are clearly visible …,’ Fanti said. But the enhancing procedure did not uncover the full body image as it appeared on the front side. `If it does exist, it is masked by the noise of the digital image itself. But we found what it is probably the image of the hands,’ Fanti said … Fanti’s finding matches a hypothesis postulated in 1990 by Dr John Jackson, a U.S. physicist who conducted the first major investigation into the shroud in 1978. Jackson speculated the presence of a faint image on the back surface of the shroud, only in correspondence to the frontal image.” (“Turin shroud shows another mystery face,” Rossella Lorenzi, Discovery News, ABC Science, 12 April 2004).Jackson’s Cloth Collapse theory is also fully compatible with the ENEA report that the image was created on the Shroud by ultraviolet radiation:“5. Chemical Nature of the Image. Electromagnetic radiation that is absorbed strongly in air consists of photons in the ultraviolet or soft x-ray region. It happens that these photons are also sufficiently energetic to photochemically modify cellulose. Such photons are strongly absorbed in cellulose over fibril-like distances. Experiments performed by the author have shown that subsequent aging in an oven of photosensitized (bleached) cloth by shortwave ultraviolet radiation produces a yellow-browned pattern like the Shroud body image composed of chemically altered cellulose. Thus, I posit that radiation from the body initially photosensitized the body image onto the Shroud. This pattern would have appeared, if the radiation was ultraviolet, as a white (bleached) image on a less white cloth. With time, natural aging would have reversed the relative shading of the image to its presently observed state where it appears darker than the surrounding cloth (which also aged or darkened with time, but not as fast).” (Jackson, 1991, p.341.

It most likely was the result of an accident, because partly filling the jar would not have hidden the Shroud.I later read in Barbara Frale's 2012 book, \"The Templars and the Shroud of Christ,\" that \"Whoever raised the lid [of such an earthenware jar] would not have seen anything but a featureless mass of cloth, too tightly turned in on itself to show even the abundant marks of blood\":\"Rather, it was a container designed for other purposes, where the Shroud was perhaps only provisionally housed. The shape of the object is exactly like that of the terra-cotta amphoras found in Qumran, which held the 800 or more manuscripts of the Essene library. In effect, amphoras were very versatile containers in which anything could and would be stored, from oil to grain to books. At the very bottom of that container there must have been some water, a small amount but enough to dampen the lower part of the cloth. This reconstruction seems to open a new and promising path of research. No doubt that kind of earthenware container was a highly commonplace object, made all over the Middle East and certainly not only in Qumran, but the community that lived in isolation on the Dead Sea shore had several features that might have made it a safe refuge for the earliest Christians, persecuted by the Jerusalem authorities almost from the time of Jesus's death. At any rate, if Salcito and Guerreschi's reconstruction is correct, it argues for a phase in the Shroud's history in which this object was not exhibited to the veneration of the faithful, but, on the contrary, hidden: Whoever raised the lid would not have seen anything but a featureless mass of cloth, too tightly turned in on itself to show even the abundant marks of blood. As is known, Jewish tradition held blood in horror and saw it as necessary to destroy anything that had come into contact with corpses, being in the highest degree impure and able to pollute people, things, and places.\" (Frale, B., 2012, \"The Templars and the Shroud of Christ,\" Skyhorse Publishing: New York NY, p.171)I then realised that I had missed your point, thinking only of the water, not the fact that this would indeed suggest that the Shroud was stored folded tightly in an earthenware jar at a time when \"it was in peril,\" namely in the early first century when the tiny Christian church was being persecuted by its far more numerous enemies, the Jews (Acts 8:1-3; 11:19; 12:1-3).\"I have posted this correction under the \"Comments\" section of my April 2018, Shroud of Turin News.Stephen E.

Agreed, but Nickell is a gifted writer, who to the man in the street who doesn't know much about the Shroud, sounds convincing.But Nickell is self-deceived through his mind having being taken captive to the philosophy (Col 2:8) of Naturalism, i.e. the philosophical position that \"nature is all there is: there is no supernatural.\"He is an example of `the blind leading the blind' (Mt 15:14).>Yet people keep quoteing his writings. Again, that's because Nickell tells secular people what they want to hear. Who have neither the time or the inclination to check what he claims.>Maybe if they would just check his credentials against those of authors of dozens of peer-reviewed papers, minds might change a bit about the Shroud's authenticity.Most people, including so-called `skeptics', haven't got the time or inclination to read the Shroud pro-authenticity web articles and books, let alone peer-reviewed journal papers. >It's truly dumbfounding.It is all part of the Plan: Isa 14:26 NIV \"This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations.\"The One whose image is on the Shroud has told us that it is His purpose to let the weeds grow with the wheat until the harvest:Mt 13:27-30. 27 And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, `Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?' 28 He said to them, `An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, `Then do you want us to go and gather them?' 29 But he said, `No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'\"when they will be separated by Him into their respective eternal destinations.The Nickell's of this world think they are destroying Christianity, when all along they are unwittingly obeying it!Stephen E.

There is no blood image. The blood is REAL blood.And as red ochre making up the body image, McCrone COULD NOT have legitimately said that because he only examined STURP's sticky tapes which were taken only from NON-IMAGE areas.McCrone found what he was looking for-isolated particles of red ochre and vermilion on STURP's sticky tapes of NON-IMAGE areas and he UNSCIENTIFICALLY: 1) extrapolated from those isolated red ochre and vermillion particles on sticky tapes from NON-IMAGE areas of the Shroud, that the blood is comprised of vermillion pigment and the body IMAGE must be comprised of red ochre; and 2) did not consider alternative explanations for the red ochre and vermillion that it was left behind on the Shroud when artists pressed their copies of the Shroud to the Shroud to confer a blessing on their copies.>And he found no pigment on the non-image areas. If that were the case then he would have found no pigment AT ALL because McCrone never went to Turin with STURP to examine the Shroud itself. ALL that McCrone had for study was STURP's sticky tapes, and STURP was not permitted to, and did not, press their sticky tapes to image areas of the Shroud. >I realize that these results were not peer reviewed, but if he is wrong, it seems like a rookie mistake...McCrone signed a STURP agreement that he would only publish his findings in peer-reviewed scientfic journals, as other STURP findings were, but he reneged and published them in his own journal, The Microscope and in the media. Why? The answer must be because he knew deep down that his findings would not survive peer-review because they were WRONG.  McCrone was an atheist/agnostic and extremely biased against the Shroud's authenticity. In 1981, AFTER he had examined STURP's sticky tapes and handed them back he made the most unscientific admission: \"I believe the shroud is a fake, but I cannot prove it.\" (McCrone, W.C., in Murphy, C., \"Shreds of Evidence,\" Harper's Magazine, November, 1981, pp.42-65, pp.54-55).So even McCrone admitted that his finding red ochre and vermillion on sticky tapes from NON-IMAGE areas of the Shroud did not prove it was a fake. And HOW then did McCrone KNOW that the Shroud was a fake? >which only leaves the option that he lied, since he was a highly respected microscoptist. Not necessarily. It could mean that he so much WANTED the Shroud to be a fake that he went BEYOND the scientific evidence available to him and AGAINST the scientific evidence of other STURP scientists.>This is certainly possible, but I don't like to make an assumption that a scientist is fabricating data. You are now arguing against a straw man that YOU have created. I do not claim that McCrone \"lied\" just that he was so biased against the Shroud's authenticity that he went beyond the limited evidence available to him and did not consider alternative explanations.[continued]","date":"January 9, 2013 at 10:20 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/05/you-state-that-there-is-no-paint-dye-or.html","title":"You state that `there is no paint, dye or pigment on the Shroud that forms its image' but it is claimed that `the Shroud contains red ochre and other paint pigments'"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Anonymous>Some have claimed that the image is the result of a Bas Relief rubbing technique. ...

No. STURP found a lot of isolated particles on the Shroud, but they were not more concentrated in the image areas than the non-image areas. And particles that COULD form the image, like a particular paint, pigment or mixture of same, would have to be ONLY, or at least HIGHLY, concentrated in the image area for it to form the image. And they aren't. Proof of that is the Shroud has been in at least two very hot fires in 1532 and 1997 and in both case the image was not chemically changed as it would have been if it was formed by pigments. And in the 1997 fire the Shroud was sprayed with water from firemen's hoses which turned to steam in the Shroud's container, yet the image did not run as it would have if it was a pigment.>If there are only the two, it would seem odd that only two pigments would be found from 'sanctifying' other 'shrouds' against the 'real Shroud'. You would expect multiple pigments, I would imagine.There ARE \"multiple pigments\" on the Shroud, but NONE of them are sufficiently concentrated in the Shroud's image area to form its image.Stephen E.

Haldane (1892–1964), realised, that “if my mind is a mere by-product of matter” then “I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true”:“It seems to me immensely unlikely that mind is a mere by-product of matter. For if my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true. They may be sound chemically, but that does not make them sound logically. And hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms. In order to escape from this necessity of sawing away the branch on which I am sitting, so to speak, I am compelled to believe that mind is not wholly conditioned by matter.” (Haldane, J.B.S., “When I Am Dead,” in “Possible Worlds: And Other Essays,” [1927], Chatto and Windus: London, 1932, reprint, p.209).And one of those beliefs is “that mind arises from nothing more nor less than the actions of the [material] brain.” In other words, as C.S. Lewis pointed out many years ago (e.g. in his 1947 book Miracles), Materialist statements like, “mind arises from nothing more nor less than the actions of the [material] brain” is self-refuting. While I appreciate Prof. Barash’s candour (and nothing I write here should be construed as a personal attack on him or his ilk), nevertheless, Materialists have for decades (if not centuries) been making promises like, “I am also nearly as confident that some day, we’ll understand how.” It even has a name, “Promissory Materialism“!Stephen E.

And they would rule in as “science” some fields not generally regarded as science, e.g. Creation-Science. For example to claim that Creation-Science is “untestable” and “unfalsifiable” and then claim it has been tested and found to be false, would be self-contradictory.But that does not prevent science polemicists claiming that an opposing position is “pseudoscience.” Their aim is to rule out in advance an opposing view so that it cannot get a fair hearing. That saves them doing the hard work of showing that an opposing view is wrong.As regards Colin Berry claiming that the field of Shroud pro-authenticity (Sindonology) is “pseudoscience,” it would be helpful for him to state upfront his demarcation criteria of what he regards as “pseudoscience.” If it is any of the usual criteria, like “testable,” “falsifiable,” “repeatable,” then the Shroud pro-authenticity hypothesis would pass with flying colours.For example, the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud showed that the Shroud pro-authenticity position is both “testable” and “falsifiable”. It was claimed in NATURE that “The results provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval … A.D. 1260-1390,” and therefore the Shroud could not be authentic. That is, the Shroud was tested and found to be false (or so the dating laboratories thought). It would therefore be self-contradictory of Colin (and the Royal Society) to claim that Shroud pro-authenticity is “untestable” and “unfalsifiable” and yet regard the 1988 radiocarbon dating as having tested the Shroud’s authenticity and found it to be not authentic. As regards “repeatable,” all that is required is that the major features of the Shroud are replicated using knowledge, materials and technology available in the 14th century. Some have in fact tried to do that but to date all have failed.It might be argued that the theory that the Shroud’s image was caused by radiation emitted by Jesus’ resurrection fails the “repeatable” demarcation criterion. But some parts of mainstream science are not “repeatable,” e.g. the Big Bang and macroevolutionary events. And the theory that the Shroud’s image was caused by radiation emitted by Jesus’ resurrection is not essential to the Shroud pro-authenticity position.So before Colin writes his letter to the Royal Society claiming that Shroud pro-authenticity (Sindonology) is a pseudoscience he should first clearly state his demarcation criteria of what he regards as “science” and “pseudoscience,” and then show objectively and non-circularly how Shroud pro-authenticity satisfied his “pseudoscience” demarcation criteria.","date":"March 4, 2013 at 10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/defining-pseudoscience-it-takes-a-rocket-surgeon/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Defining Pseudoscience:  It Takes a Rocket Surgeon"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Agreed. I was going to add that Shroud pro-authenticity has often published its findings and theories in peer-reviewed scientific journals, as STURP did; but by contrast Shroud anti-authenticity has rarely published its findings in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The publication of the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud in NATURE might be the only occasion that Shroud anti-authenticity published its findings in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. And even then it is doubtful if that paper went through peer-review.But it is not generally regarded as a demarcation criterion of science that a finding or theory must be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. For example, Charles Darwin’s theories of evolution by natural and sexual selection were not published in peer-reviewed scientific journals even though they did then exist. And Walter McCrone’s Shroud anti-authenticity findings and claims were only published in his own in-house journal THE MICROSCOPE.Also, while not a demarcation criterion of science, a mark of good science is presenting one’s paper before one’s peers at scientific conferences. And Shroud pro-authenticity has held regular scientific conferences. On my bookshelf I have the proceedings of six such conferences. But Shroud anti-authenticity has never, as far as I am aware, ever held even one such scientific conference.So on any objective criterion of good science, Shroud pro-authenticity passes with flying colours, and Shroud anti-authenticity only receives a bare pass, if that.Another criterion of good science is the attitude of its proponents. Shroud pro-authenticity, for the most part, relies on evidence and argument, with personal attack being rare and frowned upon when it occurs. But Shroud anti-authenticity relies heavily on ad hominem attacks. For example, Harry Gove, in his book on the 1988 radiocarbon dating, ruled out of court Shroud pro-authenticity proponents like STURP, on the basis that they were all Christian believers (which wasn’t even true) and therefore biased in favour of the Shroud’s authenticity. But Gove, like most Shroud anti-authenticists, was blind to his own anti-Christian bias. Another example is a radio debate between Barrie Schwortz and Joe Nickell, where the latter relied heavily on ad hominem attacks against Shroud pro-authenticists, but Schwortz (a non-practicing Jew) simply presented the evidence for the Shroud’s authenticity.Indeed, if heavy reliance on ad hominem attacks is a mark of bad science in respect of the Shroud, then Colin himself is a prime example. Colin, for all his claims to be a scientist, seems unable to mount a rational argument without resorting to ad hominem attacks upon those he disagrees with. To me this is `body language’ which reveals that deep down Colin does not have confidence in his Shroud anti-authenticist position. Indeed, if I were Colin I would be embarrassed to draw the attention of the Royal Society to my blog!","date":"March 4, 2013 at 10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/defining-pseudoscience-it-takes-a-rocket-surgeon/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Defining Pseudoscience:  It Takes a Rocket Surgeon"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Maybe it is a clue that Leonardo invented the ultraviolet laser and used it to make the Shroud?

In the beginning of time, God already WAS (Gn 1:1; Jn 1:1). God is the I AM (Ex 3:14), which if it means anything, means He is not subject to time. Jesus referring to this, confirmed that God IS the God of the long-dead patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, because “to him all are alive.” (Lk 20:37-39).As for the Kenosis Theory, that in His Incarnation “Christ emptied himself of his divine (eternal) nature and became human (temporal)”, the Bible passage it is based on, Philippians 2:5-6, does NOT say that. Reading from my Interlinear New Testament, it says: “… Christ Jesus, who in the form [Gk. morphe = nature] of God SUBSISTING [huparchon] … himself emptied [ekenosen = come to nothing – hence “made himself of no reputation” KJV] the form of a slave taking …” So Paul is NOT saying that Christ emptied Himself of His God-nature, but that, while REMAINING GOD, He took on a human nature.That Jesus still had His God nature while on Earth, but normally voluntarily suppressed it, is evident in that with a word of command He stilled a storm (Mt 8:18,23-27; Mk 4:35-41; Lk 8:22-25), and the disciples, some of whom were professional fisherman, “were terrified and asked each other, `Who is this?

Their presence on the Shroud, with the former confirmed by its pollen grains and both identified by presumed imaging, indicate that the Shroud originated in the spring season (March-April) in the Jerusalem area. The high indicative value of Gundelia tournefortii‘s pollen grains derives from the fact that it is a monotypic genus (Feinbrun-Dothan, 1978).

That is because there is a species in that genus, Carduus argentatus, which grows around Jerusalem, flowers in April-May, has a more attractive flower (see above), and is a much less thorny plant than Gundelia tournefortii.”It has just occurred to me that there is a second blessing in disguise if this is an error in classification by Frei, in that it would be evidence against claims by Shaffersman and others that Frei’s data was fraudulent. That is because if Frei did collect modern pollen and claim it was Gundelia tournefortii he would have collected pollen from that species as an easily identified living plant.

A draft (not the original) 1389 memo by a French Bishop who claimed his predecessor (not he himself, therefore just hearsay) thirty-four years previously knew the artist who painted the Shroud (except the Shroud is not a painting);2. A 1988 radiocarbon test by three labs, on a tiny 1.2 x 0.8 cm, postage stamp sized sample of the Shroud, taken from the worst possible location: a damaged, patched, highly contaminated corner, claimed in a 1989 Nature paper, that the Shroud was “medieval … AD 1260-1390.” But a table in that Nature paper, giving the actual results of those test, on the same tiny sample, divided amongst the three labs, using the same AMS method of C14 dating, showed a spread of ages of the Shroud from a maximum of 795+65=860 years (Oxford) to a minimum of 591-30=561 (Arizona), i.e. 299 years. This can only be explained (assuming that at least two of the three labs did not simply bungle the test) by there being contamination from new carbon (e.g. from a 16th century invisible repair) which the labs pre-cleaning had not removed.Second, the Shroud has led uncountable millions to faith in Christ, not least in the first ~1500 years of Christianity before the invention of the printing press and the translation of the Bible into national languages. If the Shroud is a trick by Satan then the joke is on him (the same applies to Picknett & Prince’s claim that Leonardo faked the Shroud as a prank played on Christianity)!

But that is all it is – a prejudice.God is neither an evangelical nor a Roman Catholic. And there were no Protestant churches in existence in 1355 (the Protestant Reformation started in 1517) when the Shroud first appeared in undisputed documented history in Lirey, France. Moreover, the Roman Catholic Church has only owned the Shroud since 1983, when it was bequeathed to it in the will of ex-King Umberto II, whose Savoy family had been the owners of the Shroud since 1453.But even on evangelical (“the Bible alone”) premises, there is reason to accept the authenticity of the Shroud. The Bible records in all four Gospels that Jesus was buried in a linen Shroud (Mt 27:59; Mk 15:46; Lk 23:53; Jn 19:40). And the Bible also records that the disciples found Jesus’ burial clothes left behind in the empty tomb (Lk 24:12; Jn 20:5-7). The Bible does not record that the disciples left Jesus’ graveclothes in the tomb, nor that they later disposed of them. So on purely evangelical (“the Bible alone”) premises, evangelicals have no reason to reject the authenticity of the Shroud. Indeed, if they were consistent, since the Bible does go out of its way to mention Jesus’ linen burial Shroud: “And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud” (Mt 27:59); “And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud …” (Mk 15:46);  “Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud …” (Lk 23:53); and does not mention the disciples abandoning or disposing of it; evangelicals should, on balance, be in favour of the Shroud’s authenticity, or at least be neutral towards it.>Even then I was sceptical about the “Shroud”, as I am to this day!So was I, for nearly 40 years, until I set aside my prejudice and actually read the evidence for the Shroud’s authenticity.

C. Goldoni: “The Shroud of Turin and the bilirubin blood stains” Atti dell’International Conference on The Shroud of Turin: Perspectives on a Multifaceted Enigma, edito da G. Fanti (Edizioni Libreria Progetto Padova 2009) pp. 442-445. http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p04.pdfIn that paper, which was translated from Italian and difficult to follow, Goldoni (a Doctor of Medicine and Clinical Pathologist) states:“Coming back to the Shroud it is important to note that the bright-red colour of blood, visible on the cloth, is connected with an exposure to ultraviolet rays. This last result was in agreement with many previous observations. … However, the following irradiation in the UV-next showed, after exposure of only 30 minutes, a sharp change towards the bright red colour regardless the bilirubin excess in each samples (Fig. 2)” (pp.3,5).As it happens, last night I re-read physicist John Jackson’s 1991, “An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image” and in it Jackson presciently (20+ years ago) attributed the Shroud’s image to ultraviolet light emitted from the body:“Chemical Nature of the Image. Electromagnetic radiation that is absorbed strongly in air consists of photons in the ultraviolet or soft x-ray region. It happens that these photons are also sufficiently energetic to photochemically modify cellulose. Such photons are strongly absorbed in cellulose over fibril-like distances. Experiments performed by the author have shown that subsequent aging in an oven of photosensitized (bleached) cloth by shortwave ultraviolet radiation produces a yellow-browned pattern like the Shroud body image composed of chemically altered cellulose. Thus, I posit that radiation from the body initially photosensitized the body image onto the Shroud. This pattern would have appeared, if the radiation was ultraviolet, as a white (bleached) image on a less white cloth. With time, natural aging would have reversed the relative shading of the image to its presently observed state where it appears darker than the surrounding cloth (which also aged or darkened with time, but not as fast). This mechanism is consistent with (1) the observed lack of pyrolytic products in microchemical studies of Shroud fibrils expected from high-temperature cellulose degradation (in this case image coloring occurs by natural aging at ambient temperatures over a long period of time) and (2) the absence of substances in the image areas that chemically colored the cloth (Note that image coloration is produced onto the cloth only by radiation and without any extraneous chemicals).” (Jackson, J.P., “An Unconventional Hypothesis to Explain all Image Characteristics Found on the Shroud Image,” in Berard, A., ed., “History, Science, Theology and the Shroud,” Symposium Proceedings, St. Louis Missouri, June 22-23, 1991, The Man in the Shroud Committee of Amarillo, Texas: Amarillo TX, 1991, p.341. Emphasis original). And what’s more, Jackson had proposed that the Shroud’s blood was also photochemically modified:“Photochemical Modification of the Shroud Blood. Given that the assumed radiation stimulus induced a chemical change in the cellulose of the Shroud, which we refer to generically as the `body image,’ it is reasonable to ask if analogous chemical changes might also have been induced in the blood which remained attached to the Shroud during the hypothesized collapse.” (Jackson, 1991, p.343.

Agreed. Between 1502 and 1509 seems to be the most likely dates. >What proportion of the shroud would have required highly demanding, time-consuming invisible mending? Probably not more than 1 part in a 1000 at the most, would you agree- if iit was not to take an eternity?No. Medieval invisible reweavers repaired whole tapestries, so the comparatively tiny area of the Shroud it is proposed was patched would not take long.  >Given that the shroud is 4.4 x 1.1 metres, that is 48,400 sq cm, so repairs were needed on just 48 sq cm. No. Sciencebod’s “not more than 1 part in a 1000 at the most” is just a figure plucked out of the air.I have read somewhere that Margaret may have been motivated to invisibly repair only a particular patch of the Shroud that was removed since it came into the possession of her Savoy family.   >Yet the sample taken was a strip 7cm x 1 cm, i.e. 7sq cm. The chances of a strip of just 7sq cm having major repairs (especially at a corner) sufficent to throw carbon-dating, Chance has nothing to do with it. The corners are the most damaged areas of the Shroud, because they are structurally the weakest, and from time immemorial the Shroud was held up during expositions by its corners.Also, relic pieces were taken from the corners, no doubt on the principle that since it was already damaged, with pieces missing, a little bit more taken would be less noticed.If Sciencebod had actually taken the trouble to study his topic, i.e. buying and reading books on it, not just `cruising the  web’, he would know that was in fact why it was decided that the sample cut from the Shroud and given to the three labs, would be from the same already damaged and patched bottom left-hand corner of the Shroud. So that it would cause minimal visual impact to the Shroud:“Nor is this the only cause for disquiet. The 1986 protocol laid stress on the care which Mme Flury-Lemberg should exercise when choosing the location from which the samples for the radiocarbon dating should be taken. Yet despite all the years of apparent planning for the taking of the carbon-dating samples it was not until the very moment itself that Gonella and Riggi chose this location – after a very public, heated and protracted argument witnessed and attested by the entire contingent of bemused radiocarbon-dating scientists. They could hardly have chosen anywhere much more unsuitable than they did … But now we come to the decision that Gonella and Riggi arrived at after their argument: to take the sample in the form of one single sliver from the frontal image bottom corner closest to the side-strip. This must be regarded as misguided in the extreme. For yet another major cause of possible contamination of a radiocarbon-dating sample arises from any excessive handling to which it may have been subjected at times distant from when it originated. And when we study the hundreds of depictions of the Shroud being held up before the crowds during past centuries, what do we see? In example after example a cleric’s hand can be seen holding up the Shroud at, yes, the frontal image bottom corner closest to the side-strip. …. Also, while their wisest decision would have been to take several tiny samples from scattered areas, by opting for just this single site they ensured that any contamination error, however large or small, would be bound to be repeated by all three laboratories.” (Wilson, I., “The Blood and the Shroud: New Evidence that the World’s Most Sacred Relic is Real,” Simon & Schuster: New York NY, 1998, pp.190-192).>I shan’t try doing the probability calculation this time of night, and in any case I am rusty in that department. I will help Sciencebod with his “probability calculation.” Probability ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). Since the corners were the most damaged, and relics had already been taken from there, the probability is almost certain, close to 1, say 0.95, that a 6th century invisible repair to a piece that was taken for a relic, would be in the area where the radiocarbon dating sample was taken.>The very idea that the sample taken for C dating happened to have Margaret of Austria’s invisible repairs is so improbable, statistically speaking, as to be for all intents and purposes a non-starter.No. Far from being, “so improbable” that “the sample taken for C dating happened to have Margaret of Austria’s invisible repairs” it is highly probable that it was from the same area, given that both were for the same underlying reason: 1) to repair the most badly damaged corner, from which relics had been taken; and 2) to take the sample from the most badly damaged corner, from which relics had been taken!","date":"January 10, 2012 at 12:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/09/sciencebod-do-some-homework-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Sciencebod, Do some homework on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"I have now posted to my blog, with permission, John P.

Even the `Secular Bible’ Wikipedia effectively admits that the Shroud image is not a painting: “Painting  The technique used for producing the image is, according to W. McCrone, already described in a book about medieval painting published in 1847 by Charles Lock Eastlake (“Methods and Materials of Painting of the Great Schools and Masters”). Eastlake describes in the chapter “Practice of Painting Generally During the XIVth Century” a special technique of painting on linen using tempera paint, which produces images with unusual transparent features—which McCrone compares to the image on the shroud. This hypothesis was declared to be unsound as the X-ray fluorescence examination, as well as infrared thermography, did not point out any pigment. It was also found that 25 different solvents, among them water, do not reduce or sponge out the image.The non-paint origin has been further claimed by Fourier transform of the image: common paintings show a directionality that is absent from the Turin Shroud.” (“Shroud of Turin: Hypotheses on image origin-Painting and pigmentation,” Wikipedia, 15 January 2012).KnightErrant’s, “There is no more reason to believe in God than to believe in unicorns,” reminds me of an atheist I debated years ago on an Internet forum who claimed that God was nonexistent like Santa Claus. So I asked him: 1) why does he bother debating the existence of God then? 2) On what other forums was he debating the non-existence of Santa Claus?Internet atheists’ `body language’ (i.e. they waste a lot of time and emotion on someone they claim is non-existent) shows that they are “the sort of atheist who does not so much disbelieve in God as personally dislike Him”:“Hopping around their web world, one quickly gets the impression that there are two basic types of atheist. The first is the sincere, scholarly atheist, the type who walked away from the Unitarians when they got too evangelical. The Maine Atheists Union typifies this bunch. They want to `think freely’ and `live free,’ and one of their main precepts reads: `Nobody has all of the answers and nobody ever will.

John, ch. 19) as `a large nail,' a `hammer,' `sponge on a reed,' `Roman thrusting spear,' `pliers,' `two scourges,' `two brush brooms,' `two small nails,' `large spoon or trowel in a box,' `a loose coil of rope,' a `cloak' with `belt,' a `tunic,' a pair of `sandals,' and other hilarious imaginings including `Roman dice'--all discovered by the Whangers (1998) ...\" (Nickell, J., 2001, \"Scandals and Follies of the 'Holy Shroud',\" Skeptical Inquirer, Vol. 25, No. 5, September, pp.17-20).>regards>Antero de Frias Moreira and Maria da Glória Barroso>(Centro Português de Sindonologia)And to you.Stephen E.

Great! I only get Dan's posts, not his comments, so I am blissfully unaware of that debate.>A significant development was that after much prompting I got him to admit that the two red streaks on the shroud were in fact blood. There is hope for him yet! As you state below it is a major concession for a Shroud anti-authenticist to admit that the blood on the Shroud is real blood (see below).I have just responded in a comment under my post, \"Shroud of Turin: Burial sheet of Jesus!: #9 The man has wounds and bloodstains matching the Gospels' description of the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus Christ\") to a private message to Gio which is about the blood on the Shroud soaking through to the underside, which I presume was based on comments on Dan's blog by Colin.>This is a significant victory, because as I pointed out to him it is unknown for art of that period and even up to at least the 14th-15th centuries, for images to show blood on the shroud in entombment scenes. Indeed it is \"a significant victory,\" which was resisted by Walter McCrone to his dying day. He knew that no medieval forger would use real blood in painting the Shroud. Apart from the fact that real blood normally turns black (the Shroud's blood is red because of the bile pigment bilirubin, which is a response to massive physical trauma), there is the inherent difficulty (not to mention repugnance) of painting with blood.And real blood on the Shroud makes hot statue/bas relief methods unviable because the blood was on the Shroud before the image and so would be cooked if the blood-soaked linen cloth was placed over the hot statue/bas relief.>This is further evidence that the manuscript is based on a viewing of the shroud.Sorry, but it is unclear to me why there being \"two red streaks on the shroud\" (there are a lot more than that) is \"further evidence that the [Pray] manuscript is based on a viewing of the shroud.>He's still saying that the 4 circles in a one-off, assymmetrical L shaped pattern are just a random decorative motif though, which just defies logic as far as I am concerned!Like most (if not all) non-Christian Shroud anti-authenticists, Colin is afraid to accept evidence that would point to the Shroud being authentic, because they rightly sense that it would be a `slippery slope' down (actually up!) the path of them becoming Christians.As the agnostic Professor of Anatomy at the Sorbonne, Yves Delage, responded to his fellow atheist/agnostic members of the French Academy of Sciences, who attacked and ridiculed him for reading a paper to them in 1902 arguing that the Shroud was authentic, `if it was anyone but Christ, the evidence would be accepted':\"If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, an Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection ... I have been faithful to the true spirit of science in treating this question, intent only on the truth, not concerned in the least whether it would affect the interests of any religious party ... I recognize Christ as a historical personage and I see no reason why anyone should be scandalized that there still exist material traces of his earthly life.'\" (Walsh, J.E., \"The Shroud,\" 1963, pp.106-107).But as Colin the scientist knows, refusing to accept evidence because one doesn't like it for personal reasons, is the very antithesis of science.The true scientific attitude is to follow the evidence wherever it leads.Stephen E.

Sorry for not articulating that clearly.OK.>Colin didn't admit to real blood on the real shroud, rather he admitted the two red streaks on the object in the Pray Manuscript image which he thinks is the sarcophagus lid and we think is the shroud, represent blood.That explains it. But it is still a problem for him, because the Pray Manuscript was created in 1192-95 and the artist depicted blood, including a mark exactly where the reversed 3 bloodstain is on the Shroud.>I think this is significant. As I say,in the history of the art of Jesus's entombment there is very little evidence of blood on Jesus's discarded cloths / shroud. Almost always the cloths / shroud are unblemished. Agreed. The Byzantine artists used the Shroud image to depict Jesus as living and ruling (which is what \"Pantocrator\" means). So it is very significant that the Pray Manuscript depicted Jesus nude and with bloodstains, as He is on the Shroud.>I think that the Pray Manuscript artist shows two red streaks representing a bloodied shroud is therefore very significant.By the other red streak, apart from the reversed 3, I thought you meant the crown of thorns mark(s) in Jesus' hair on plate III (but see below). There are also red marks on Jesus' hands and right side on plate IV, corresponding to the nail wound and the spear wound bloodstains on the Shroud, although the left hand is covered by the right hand on the Shroud.But most significantly, equivalent to the L-shaped `poker holes', Jesus' right hand on plate IV has the red nail wound mark on Jesus' wrist, exactly where it is on the Shroud! See my JPG of it in my 2010, \"The Pray Manuscript.\" The significance of this is actually strengthened by the fact the Pray Manuscript artist depicted the nail wound on the left hand of plate IV, which is covered by the right hand on the Shroud, in the palm as it traditionally is depicted by medieval artists. I am going to insert this as point 5 in \"My critique of `The Pray Codex,' Wikipedia, 1 May 2011, making 13 points (14 if the crown of thorns bloodstains are also inserted). I will also add an image of plate IV to that page.>My interpretation is that the two red streaks represent the two long streaks of blood on the arms of Jesus in the real shroud. I cannot see those \"two red streaks\" on plate III of my copy of Berkowitz.>In my view this is all stacking up very nicely, as the two long streaks of blood on the arms in the real shroud, and the L shaped poker holes, are two of the most prominent features.And the nail bloodstain in the wrist of Jesus' right hand of plate IV, exactly as it is on the Shroud, contrary to the traditional crucifix depiction of the nails being in Jesus' palms, as they are on Jesus' left hand in plate IV![continued]","date":"June 16, 2012 at 7:26 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/06/turin-shroud-is-fake-and-its-one-of-40.html","title":"`The Turin Shroud is a fake ... and it's one of 40': Antonio Lombatti"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Matt: it is a before-and-after scene, so the saint appears twice, and likewise so does the sick girl, probably at death's door (your \"Christ\")on the left restored to health on the right.Note the duplication of all the key figures.","date":"July 18, 2012 at 6:44 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/06/turin-shroud-is-fake-and-its-one-of-40.html","title":"`The Turin Shroud is a fake ... and it's one of 40': Antonio Lombatti"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">So the biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samplesEver since Mexican paediatrician and microbiologist Dr Leoncio Garza-Valdes was given fibres by Riggi in 1993 from his `reserve sample’ and claimed that he had found fragments of Jesus’ DNA on it, and published his results in a 1998 book with the sensationalised title, “The DNA of God?” it has been the Vatican’s `party line’ that any claimed samples of the Shroud that it doesn’t hold are invalid. But as Garza-Valdes pointed out at the time, he had been personally given the fibres by Riggi, from a container in Riggi’s house, which had the seal of the then Archbishop of Turin, Cardinal Ballestrero’s on it, and Garza-Valdes had a photograph of it to prove it. So Garza- Valdes is a witness (and there are others) to the fact that Riggi, with the tacit permission of the then Archbishop of Turin, kept back a `reserve sample’ of the Shroud that he cut for the three C-14 laboratories in 1988.However, if one wants to be super-sceptical, then to be consistent he/she would have to grant that the conspiracy theorists have a point that no one can absolutely prove that the Shroud samples tested by the three C-14 laboratories in 1988 were not switched, for the sample from the 13th century cope of St.  Louis d’Anjou, which was a last-minute inclusion as a control in the samples given to the three C-14 laboratories to test.","date":"March 29, 2013 at 3:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Yannick now changes the subject, rather than admit he was wrong, from his original point that: “Garlaschelli made a press conference to claim he had reproduced the Shroud, people in the pro-Shroud world were completely offended by this kind of acting.

So this is my last comment answering Yannick’s comments under this post.>>Quote: “Third, the decision to publish Fanti’s book at Easter, before Fanti’s paper appeared in the journal, is the book’s PUBLISHER, not Fanti’s.”>Answer: How do you know this? So, you think Fanti has not a word to say about the date of release of his own book? Come on!!!That is, as far as I am aware, the case with most (if not all) books.

Does that thereby make the C-14 scientists not “credible and honest”?”>Announcing some results at a press conference while you’re sure to be publish in a highly respected peer-reviewed journal is one thing and selling a book for popular crowds before being published in a scientific journal that accept almost everything you submit for publication is another thing in my mind…There is no evidence that the “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” paper in Nature, Vol. 337, 16th February, 1989, pp.611-615, was peer-reviewed.And again, the article says that Fanti had ALREADY submitted his paper to the journal.>But in the end, I don’t care too much. That’s not the most important thing to note about this whole affair… No, the most important thing to remember is this: Fanti can claim anything he wants on the basis of his analysis of his very old and questionable dust samples, Yannick keeps mentioning “dust samples”. But the Vatican Insider article says nothing about “dust”. It says “FIBRES” (my emphasis):“The machine used to examine the Shroud’s FIBRES and test traction, allowed researchers to examine tiny FIBRES alongside about twenty samples of cloth dated between 3000 BC and 2000 AD…. Final results show that the Shroud FIBRES examined produced the following dates, all of which are 95% certain and centuries away from the medieval dating obtained with Carbon-14 testing in 1988: the dates given to the Shroud after FT-IR testing, is 300 BC ±400, 200 BC ±500 after Raman testing and 400 AD ±400 after multi-parametric mechanical testing. The average of all three dates is 33 BC  ±250 years. …The tests were carried out using tiny FIBRES of material extracted from the Shroud by micro-analyst Giovanni Riggi di Numana who passed away in 2008 but had participated in the1988 research project and gave the material to Fanti through the cultural institute Fondazione 3M.”>but he will never be able to get largely accepted these as proven facts regarding the Shroud by the scientific community. Since “the scientific community” is dominated by atheist/agnostics whose religious philosophy is Naturalism (“nature is all there is-there is no supernatural”) and therefore are IMPLACABLY OPPOSED to Christianity, that is one thing that Yannick and I agree on.>Again, that’s the reality, because of the highly questionable aspect of the samples he used and also because of the highly suspicion that exist versus the honesty, integrity and profesionnalism of the man. Ad hominem fallacy again.>So, before some of Fanti’s claims can be accepted as true facts by the scientific community, be sure that it will take more than a peer-reviewed journal publication, especially if this publication happen in the same journal in which Fanti always publish his works about the Shroud. Personally I am more interested in the TRUTH of Fanti’s claims than whether “the scientific community” accepts them. And again the bottom line is that there are ONLY TWO viable alternatives: 1) either the Shroud of Turin is a forgery; or 2) the Shroud of Turin is authentic. The problems of the Shroud pro-authenticity position 2) PALE INTO INSIGNIFICANCE compared to those of 1) the forgery position. It is highly significant that no one advocating 2) the forgery position has ever published a comprehensive and coherent explanation for the origin of the Shroud, which plausibly explains all the major facts about the Shroud. In my series “The Shroud of Turin” I am collecting all the problems of the forgery theory as a I go along and I will present them all together in section “9. Problems of the forgery theory.”But if 2) is correct and the Shroud is authentic then the Shroud’s fibres MUST date no later than the first century AD. Then problems of the dating of the Shroud and its fibres must be merely APPARENT problems, not REAL problems, due to our ignorance and misunderstandings.>In fact, it will take another round of direct researches on the Shroud that could scientifically confirm them.

That is Colin’s own straw man. They were just “threads” from “tufts” taken from the cope of St. Louis d’Anjou:“The Cluny Museum was contacted but refused to be involved. `…They got scared …’ as Evin remarked later. So he and one Gabriel Vial went along to the Basilica of Saint-Maximin at Var and pulled some tufts out of the cope known to have been worn by St. Louis d’Anjou (d. 1297). A postal strike intervened so Vial had to hurry to Turin himself and hand his “control sample” to Tite himself on the very day of the cutting of the sample from the Shroud: 21 April 1988. … Confronted with the importunities of an excited Vial, the imperturbable Tite divided his offering into three parts which he placed not in cylinders but in envelopes for the three laboratories as an apparently unexpected but later very useful “Sample 4″ – threads from the cope of St. Louis d’Anjou (d. 1297).” (D. J. McDonnell, “The Great Holy Shroud Dating Fraud of 1988,” 4 November 2003).But it had to be enough linen in those threads for the three C-14 laboratories to carry out a valid C-14 dating, otherwise they would not have been valid controls.And each of the three C-14 laboratories subdivided their postage size sample of the Shroud several times (one was 9 times from memory), and each subdivided sample had to have enough linen to do a valid C-14 dating. From memory the Shroud samples were reduced to threads anyway, so that they could be pre-treated more thoroughly. A self-styled `Sciencebod’ if he thought about it (even if he had not bothered to READ about it) should have realised that the C-14 labs did not do their tests on the `rectangle’ of Shroud linen that they were each given.So if the Shroud is authentic (as all the evidence, apart from the 1988 radiocarbon dating, points to), then an explanation is needed for how three C-14 laboratories `just happened’ to agree on a C-14 date range, 1260-1390, the mid-point of which, 1325, `just happened’ to be about 25 years before the Shroud appeared at Lirey in the 1350s.A not unreasonable explanation is that, faced with a public relations disaster, of three C-14 labs all using the then new AMS method, and with literally a million pounds then riding on Oxford’s AMS test being successful, and with the labs being unable to come up with a consistent, publishable, C-14 date, with some of the C-14 sub-samples yielding a C-14 date of 1st century, and other sub-samples yielding a C-14 date of 16th century (due to an invisible repair with cotton-which Oxford lab actually discovered after Arizona had done its test), the three labs all agreed to use a 13-14th century date range, the midpoint of which was just before the Shroud first appeared in the European historical record. And one way to do that was use some of the dates that the 13th century cope of St. Louis d’Anjou had yielded. It used to be a trump card argument in favour of the 1325 +/- 65 years C-14 date, that if the Shroud was 1st century, then how did it `just happen’ to yield a a mid-point date that was a mere 25 years before the Shroud appeared in the undisputed historical record? But that argument cuts both ways: if the Shroud IS 1st century (as the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence points to), then how did it `just happen’ to yield a mid-point date that was a mere 25 years before the Shroud appeared in the undisputed historical record?!Therefore, I stand by my point (without necessarily saying or believing that that is what happened): “…no one can absolutely prove that the Shroud samples tested by the three C-14 laboratories in 1988 were not switched, for the sample from the 13th century cope of St. Louis d’Anjou …” >It should be easy enough therefore to shoot down this latest unhelpful attempt to muddy the waters of science by going back to the cope to see if there’s a missing rectangle.See above on the “rectangle” being Colin’s own straw man. I repeat that I said nothing about a “rectangle” being taken from the cope of St. Louis d’Anjou, and nor does my argument require it: “tufts” and “threads” from that 13th century linen cloth sufficient for three C-14 labs to each perform a valid C-14 test, will do just fine.","date":"March 29, 2013 at 9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">From comment # 18, “There is no evidence that the “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” paper in Nature, Vol. 337, 16th February, 1989, pp.611-615, was peer-reviewed.”I stand by my claim that “There is no evidence that the “Radiocarbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin,” paper in Nature, Vol. 337, 16th February, 1989, pp.611-615, was peer-reviewed.”For one thing, as I had previously pointed out, if the paper had been peer-reviewed, it would have been rejected, so variable were its C14-dates and so fallacious was its reasoning. For example it is simply fallacious to claim that because a postage stamp sized (approx. 45 x 12 mm) sample of a ~4400 mm x 1110 mm cloth (i.e. 1/0.00011 th or 0.011% of the whole) returned a 1260-1390 C-14 date, therefore the whole cloth must have the same date. Any peer-review committee worthy of the name would have pointed out that elementary error of scientific logic and asked that the paper’s conclusion, “The results provide conclusive evidence that the linen of the Shroud of Turin is mediaeval” be qualified by something like, “If the very small sample of the Shroud which was radiocarbon-dated, amounting to only 0.011% of the whole cloth, is representative of the whole cloth, then ….” Apart from the fact that, as I have previously pointed out, if the Shroud IS first century (as ALL the other evidence points to), how did the three labs `just happen’ to come up with a date range, 1260-1390, the midpoint of which 1325 +/- 65 years, `just happens’ to be a mere 25 years before the Shroud appeared in the historical record? Or to put it another way, if the odds of the Shroud being 1st century, yet yielding a 13th-14th century radiocarbon date, is “about one in a thousand trillion”: “According to Professor Harry Gove, prime inventor of the state-of-the-art accelerator mass spectrometry method that was used to carbon date the Shroud, the very same scientific criteria that provide a ninety-five per cent degree of probability in favour of the Shroud’s manufacture between 1260 and 1390 also provide odds of ‘about one in a thousand trillion’  [Gove,  H.E., “Relic, Icon or Hoax?: Carbon Dating the Turin Shroud,”  1996, p.303] against it dating back to the time of Jesus.” (Wilson, I., “The Blood and the Shroud, 1998, p.179. Emphasis original)then if the Shroud IS 1st century (as ALL the evidence except the 1988 C-14 date points to), then the odds that the 1260-1390 radiocarbon date of the Shroud is correct, is “about one in a thousand trillion”!But in that case, it is far more likely that the 1260-1390 radiocarbon date of the Shroud was the result of SCIENTIFIC FRAUD, than that a coincidence, the odds against which were “about one in a thousand trillion”, `just happened’.","date":"March 30, 2013 at 11:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">The man’s a complete buffoon.

Freeman is writing about \"an early sixteenth century Byzantine icon ... [called] Noli Me Tangere (when Mary Magdalene meets Jesus in the garden).\" See John 20:11-17. I wasn't even going to quote this because being 16th century the icon is more recent than the Shroud's first public appearance in Lirey, France in c.1355, and therefore it is of no value in tracing the Shroud's \"missing history\" through congruencies between it and 6th-13th century Byzantine icons. >There is a separate sudarium and the wrappings from which Christ had extricated himself. The cloths found in the Jerusalem tomb in 2009 correlate with this tradition, an interesting example which points to the historical reliability of John’s gospel.\"Note Freeman's anti-Christian \"wrappings from which Christ had EXTRICATED HIMSELF.\" Not \"had been RESURRECTED THROUGH.\" Presumably the atheist/agnostic Freeman holds to a version of the `Jesus did not die on the Cross' theory. Because a dead body cannot \"extricate himself\" from his burial wrappings! And a resurrected Jesus would just pass through them (or rather, according to Jackson's \"cloth collapse\" theory, they would pass through Him).>Note the references to the separate sudarium and the wrappings, and the reference to the 2009 tomb findings supporting this.Again I see nothing of great significant in this.

That’s a puzzle to me.It was the same Giovanni Riggi who unstitched for STURP in 1978 part of the back of the Shroud:“Having acquired some considerable skills as a microscopist, in 1978 Riggi participated in the STURP scientific examination of the Shroud, a privilege that was arguably facilitated by his close friendship with the then Cardinal of Turin’s scientific advisor, Professor Luigi Gonella. Conspicuous in the Shroud test room for his spotless white coat and his meticulous methodology, Riggi quickly attracted the attention and admiration of the American scientific team, and despite his very limited command of English became formally enlisted him as one of STURP’s members. One of the procedures agreed for the 1978 testing work was the partial unstitching of one side of the Shroud from the backing cloth to which it had been sewn ever since 1534 …” (Ian Wilson, “Obituary – Giovanni Riggi,” BSTS Newsletter, No. 67, June 2008).It would seem easy, and indeed unavoidable, for threads of the Shroud to come loose in Riggi’s hand while was removing its backing cloth. If so, and Riggi is known to have personally souvenired for his own `reserve sample’ part of the 1988 sample cut for the three C-14 labs, then it would not be surprising if he similarly personally souvenired threads of the Shroud arising from STURP’s 1978 examination.If that did happen then Fanti might have been unaware of it until he gained access to Riggi’s samples after his death in 2008. And it might explain why Fanti avoids mentioning it, so as not to detract from the late Prof. Riggi’s memory. Because, while Riggi’s 1988 personal souveniring of part of the 1988 Shroud sample may be defendable because Turin’s Archbishop Ballestrero approved it, there seems to be no such excuse if Riggi did personally souvenir threads from the Shroud in 1978, if no one else knew about it, let alone someone with the requisite authority having approved it. Remember that in 1978 the Shroud was the property of ex-King Umberto II who lived in exile in Spain, so even Turin’s then Archbishop, the same Cardinal Ballestrero, could not have given Riggi permission to keep threads of the Shroud for himself. If Riggi did, without authorisation, and especially if it was without anyone else even knowing about it, keep for himself threads from the Shroud which he obtained during his 1978 removal of the Shroud’s backing cloth for STURP in 1978, then I would have thought that was STEALING, and stealing of a most serious nature.","date":"March 29, 2013 at 10:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/barrie-schwortz-biggest-issue-so-far-seems-to-be-the-validity-of-fantis-samples/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Biggest issue so far seems to be the validity of Fanti’s samples"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"MattI am going to answer these comments which are about other parts of Freeman's paper only briefly. Otherwise I will be duplicating what I am going to write later.>\"An even more bizarre explanation comes when Wilson tackles Byzantine art. Note Freeman's preface of \"bizarre\" to Wilson's theory that the Edessa Image was the Shroud of Turin doubled-in-four, with only the face 1/8th of the Shroud visible in landscape mode.As mentioned in my post above, this is part of Freeman's ongoing attempt to \"poison the well\" against Wilson's theory in the minds of Freeman's readers.>Seventy years ago a Frenchman, Paul Vignon, noted that the bearded face on the Turin Shroud has some of the characteristics of Byzantine art. Vignon was not only \"a Frenchman\", but a Professor of Biology and an artist. But to be fair to Freeman, Wilson does not mention this in his latest book \"The Shroud\" (2010) which Freeman is relying on. >All kinds of measuring was done and some enthusiasts found as many as sixty resemblances. Note Freeman's \"enthusiasts\" being part of his continuing attempt to \"poison the well\" against Wilson's theory in the minds of his readers. And Freeman conceals from his readers that Wilson in his book only mentions 15 of these \"Vignon markings\" - unique congruencies between Byzantine depictions of Christ starting from the early 6th century and the Shroud.>This is all interesting but Wilson goes on to make the absurd suggestion that this was because Byzantine art was born from the Image of Edessa, also known to Wilson as the Turin Shroud! More \"poisoning of the well\" by Freeman. Wilson's theory that \"the Image of Edessa\" is \"the Turin Shroud\" is dismissed by Freeman as \"absurd\". This is what we might expect from some anonymous commenter to a blog, not a professional historian.>Wilson makes some vague points about a new period in art at this time and finds a reference to two wandering Georgian monks with contacts with Edessa in the 530s who may have painted images. They were actually \"Assyrian monks ...Theodosius from Edessa and Isidore from Edessa's sister city Hierapolis ... Both monks travelled to Georgia specifically to paint interpretative versions of their charges for the newly founded churches there.\" (p.136). For a historian, Freeman is remarkably careless with historical facts!>His key argument is the appearance in iconography of Christ with a beard happens just at this time. Here Freeman sets up a \"straw man\" effigy of Wilson's \"appearance in iconography of Christ\" claim, so he can knock it down more easily. Wilson's clam is NOT ONLY that icons of Christ appeared \"with a beard.\" But I will go into that in detail when I get to that part of Freeman's paper.[continued]","date":"July 10, 2012 at 8:23 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-turin.html","title":"My critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey,\" part 1: \"Introduction\""},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>As we know some anti-authenticists claim the Shroud is the small cloth object on top of a sarcophagus lid.I am not aware of that. Probably because I don't normally read comments on other Shroud blogs.But in keeping with the Pray Codex artist depicting the Shroud symbolically in terms of contemporary 12th century Western burials (e.g. the empty tomb is depicted symbolically as a sarcophagus and its lid, decorated with the Shroud's `poker holes,' herringbone weave and bloodstains), the empty burial garments emerging from the sarcophagus are just part of the artists' symbolic depiction of Jesus' resurrection leaving behind the Shroud and the Sudarium.The Sudarium was, until the rediscovery in 1965 by Sindonologist Guilio Ricci of the Sudarium of Oviedo, thought to be the chin band around the head of a Jewish body to keep its mouth closed until rigor mortis had set in. And the chin band (and therefore the Sudarium) probably are (mistakenly) depicted by the artist in the strips of cloth around the neck space of the garment emerging out of the sarcophagus lid. >It's also interesting looking at this image and seeing the tomb / sarcophagus without a lid adjacent to it. Again, contrary to what some anti-authenticists say, it is actually far more common in art to see the empty tomb without an adjacent lid than an empty with an adjacent lid.OK.>Also of interest to me is Freeman's acknowledgement of the historic reliability of John's gospel - quite an admission from an atheist!!!!Yes, that is interesting. Even some Christian theologians deny that. Earlier Freeman wrote, \"These relics did, of course, exist at some point, Christ did die on the Cross and was buried in a linen cloth ...\" which I found interesting.

More of Freeman's \"straw man\". Wilson does not claim that \"Byzantine art\" BEGAN \"from the 540s.\">So we have the earliest bearded Christ in the catacomb of Commodilla in Rome in about 390 and then a fine central image of a bearded Christ in the church of San Pudenziana of c. 405 (below). Wilson acknowledges in his other writings that there were isolated parallel depictions of Christ with a beard, e.g. in the catacombs of Rome, etc. But these do not have the distinctive Vignon markings, and so are probably derived from independent traditions ultimately based on memories of what Jesus looked like.>Even a brief glance at a standard history of early Christian art would have shown Wilson the emergence of these fully fronted bearded portraits in the fifth century.\">Actually, as I have stated before, the story of St Alexius has him travelling to Edessa in 405AD to venerate an icon, that eventually \"talks to him\" and influences his spiritual path.Thanks. There is a lot of other information that the Image of Edessa is the Shroud doubled-in-four, which Freeman presumably knows about, but conceals from his readers. Even if Freeman is basing his paper on Wilson's latest book, in the interests of scholarly honesty, Freeman should have revealed the existence of that other information to his readers, so as not to mislead them.>Whilst the evidence is not categorical, I consider it very likely that the icon is the Image of Edessa, which takes us back to 400AD at least. So it is likely that the Image of Edessa DID influence the bearded depictions of Jesus that began to arise in the late 300s / early 400sGood point. Wilson's claim is NOT that the rediscovery of the Image of Edessa in 525 was the FIRST TIME Christians had seen the Shroud and what Jesus looked like on it. Wilson's theory IS that the Shroud existed from AD 30 in Jerusalem and was later taken to Edessa. And that at some point it was folded eight times (\"doubled-in-four\") and encased in a protective surround, so that only the face of Jesus was visible. So, even if the Shroud was not shown publicly, which would place the Shroud and its guardians in danger of it being confiscated by Christianity's enemies-the then much more numerous and powerful Jews and Romans, there presumably would have been hundreds, if not thousands of Christians who knew what Jesus looked like from the Shroud.And also, there is no reason why traditions of what Jesus looked like independent of the Shroud/Image of Edessa did not persist into the 4th and 5th centuries. While the New Testament does not mention what Jesus looked like, it would have been common knowledge in the early church. We must also remember that we have only a tiny `tip of the iceberg' of early Christian art that has survived. Apart from the Iconoclast movements in the 8th and 9th centuries in which over-zealous Christians themselves destroyed all the depictions of Jesus they could find, almost all ancient art (Christian and otherwise) has not survived.Stephen E.

The eleventh century Old French Life of Saint Alexis, generally recognized as the first masterpiece of French literature, contains the passage: Then he [Alexis] went off to the city of Edessa Because of an image he had heard tell of, Which the angels made at God's commandment... As Linda Cooper shows in this highly scholarly paper, the `image' referred to is none other than the Image of Edessa, and when the various versions of St. Alexis's life are studied, it makes a great deal of sense that this was one and the same as the Shroud. She cites, for instance, the Bollandist Vita Alexius which calls it `... an image of our Lord Jesus Christ made without human work on a sindone'; also the Latin Cod. Monac. Aug. S.Ulr. 111 ... `[he came] to the city of Edessa, in which there was preserved a blood-stained image of the Lord not made by hands'. Both passages clearly refute arguments that the Image of Edessa was incompatible with the cloth we know today as the Turin Shroud.\" (Ian Wilson, BSTS Newsletter, No. 16, May 1987, p.14).Also:St. Alexius (or Alexis) lived in Edessa between 412 and 435:\"Saint Alexius or Alexis of Rome or Alexis von Edessa was an Eastern saint whose veneration was later transplanted to Rome, a process facilitated by the fact that, according to the earlier Syriac legend that a \"Man of God\" of Edessa, Mesopotamia who during the episcopate of Bishop Rabbula (412-435) lived by begging and shared the alms he received with other poor people was, after his death there, found to be a native of Rome.\" (\"Alexius of Rome,\" Wikipedia, n 24 March 2012).So if while St. Alexius was in Edessa between 412-435, the Shroud was there and known to be full-length (and \"an image of our Lord Jesus Christ made without human work on a sindone\" and \"Edessa, in which there was preserved a blood-stained image of the Lord not made by hands'' can be nothing else) then that is more evidence for Ian Wilson's theory that the Image of Edessa/Mandylion and the Shroud of Turin are one and the same.----------------------------------Again Freeman conveniently ignores evidence that undermines his theory that: 1) the Image of Edessa is not the Turin Shroud, and 2) both are just two of many fake relics.Stephen E.

Rather, iIt is Freeman's thesis that: 1) the Image of Edessa is not the Turin Shroud, and 2) both are just two of many fake relics, which is in trouble.>he still has a major issue to tackle, the history of the Shroud from AD 30 to the second half of the sixth century when the Edessa Image aka to Wilson the Turin Shroud is first recorded in Edessa. It is a long period, much more challenging than filling in a mere 150 years.\"First, as you say, there IS evidence that the Shroud was in existence \"from AD 30 to the second half of the sixth century\" and I will quote some of it when I get to that part of Freeman's paper.Second, as Beecher pointed out in 1928, like an ancient \"bronze statue that was found at the bottom of the Aegean Sea,\" it still can be accepted as genuine without ANY documentary evidence, based on its own \"intrinsic proofs of authenticity\":\"I have heard many say that they are convinced that the Shroud was not produced in the fourteenth century, and that it has all the appearance of being the genuine Shroud of Christ, but they own to a feeling of diffidence regarding the long stretch of time from the thirteenth century backward. My aim in this chapter is, so far as I am able, to win the confidence and assent of such persons, and to convince them that the proof of authenticity, as it spans these centuries, is not so formidable as it appears. My chief argument is the self-proof which the Shroud has stamped upon it. This in itself, even if we had not a single document to quote, is quite sufficient. And I wish to stress the same with all the emphasis I can, lest, in the course of our long historical enquiry, it should be lost sight of. When, for instance, archaeologists desire to know the history of some ancient building or monument, they do not think of going to parish registers in search of documents. NO, they examine the building or monument itself, and they are satisfied with whatever reasonable testimony may be found therein. I will give an example even more to the point. Some eighteen months ago the London Times had a photograph of a bronze statue that was found at the bottom of the Aegean Sea. Experts examined it and pronounced it a genuine Greek statue. It was accepted as such; no one doubted the opinion that was expressed; and it will be labelled for all future time as a Greek statue.

NO, rather he would be looked upon as eccentric in not being able to see that the statue carried in itself its own proof of its genuineness. Very well, but we have vastly stronger intrinsic proof for the genuineness of the Shroud. We are dependent on the opinion of a few experts in regard to the statue. They may be wrong for aught we know, yet we trust them. But in the Shroud we have not one but several intrinsic proofs of authenticity, the force of which, at least several of which, even the untutored can see. And while not even legend has a word to say for the Greek statue, we have attaching to the Shroud a jealously guarded tradition that was never broken. In a word, if it be not what these many and varied proofs coalesce in proclaiming it to be, then it is at once a challenge and a mystery.

Check out historian Jack Markwardt's 2008 Ohio Shroud Conference, paper (PDF 2 mb+), \"Ancient Edessa and the Shroud: History Concealed by the Discipline of the Secret\"). Markwardt argues for a Jerusalem->Antioch->Edessa variation on Wilson's theory, which I find more plausible than Wilson's Jerusalem->Edessa theory.   >Freeman overlooks the fact that Christianaity was persecuted in its first few hundred years of existence, and as result Christian relics would hardly be widely publicised!!! Agreed.>Once Emperor Constantine stepped in to cut that nonsense out in the early 300s, we then have less than 100 years of a lack of documentation. I would suggest that is a relatively insignificant gap. Agreed. But it wouldn't matter if there was a ~1300 year gap until the Shroud appeared in Lirey, France in the 1350. The Shroud bears within itself its own proof of its authenticity. What is Freeman's (and his ilk's) alternative explanation of how the Shroud image was formed? They don't have one.>Or even if the St Alexius story is not accepted, about 200 years which again isn't really problematic.Agreed.>It should also be remembered that the iconoclasm from the early 700s likely saw many images and / or records of the Mandylion / Image o Edessa / Shroud of Turin destroyedAgreed. But we should get sucked into playing by Freeman's rules, i.e. `the Shroud cannot be accepted as authentic until there is an unbroken paper trail going back to AD30.' But even if there was, the Freemans of this world wouldn't accept it. Freeman (and his ilk) denies even that the Pray Manuscript (1192-95) was based on the Shroud, so it is clear that NO evidence for the Shroud's authenticity would suffice for him/them.Stephen E.

Therefore, as previously requested, I don't want him to be mentioned her because: 1) it gives him a continued proxy presence on my blog; and 2) it could be claimed by him to be unfair, that he is attacked in comments on my blog, but is unable to post comments in reply defending himself.>(no matter what you think of the artist's abilities, he does tend to get scale and perspective quite accurate in the illustration, and this cloth is far too small relative to the human figures adjacent to be the shroud. You are on the right track Mr Freeman!!!).Disagee. See above. Freeman has the wrong Gospel scene and the wrong burial cloth.>And finally Freeman again:>>\"No one who had seen the Turin Shroud and been impressed with it would have illustrated the discarded burial cloths of Jesus as is actually done on the Pray Codex, What with the sarcophagus and its lid, decorated with the Shroud's `poker holes' and herringbone weave, the the \"discarded burial cloths of Jesus\" are all part of the artist's depiction of the Shroud SYMBOLICALLY.>with, in the conventional gospel representation from John, of the sudarium being shown separately as it clear from a blow-up pof this part of the manuscript. Again, see above that Freeman gets his Gospel scenes mixed up. The artist is showing Mark 16:5-6, not John 20:7>There is not a single hint that there is anything to do with the Turin Shroud here!\">Comment:>Wrong! Freeman the historian should know as much as anyone that ancient art used much symbolism. He probably does, but his ex-Catholic prejudice against relics, including the Shroud, has clouded his mind.>He acknowledges the small bundled cloths are the sudarium (good!) but fails to see the Shroud beneath it.Agree with the second, but not the first.

As de Wesselow pointed out in his book, \"The Sign,\" the artist may not have been permitted by the Constantinople authorities to copy the Shroud (as those copies would become competing icons to the Shroud itself). So what the Pray Codex artist has done, is depicted the Shroud symbolically.>As it is they are jumbled up and hardly seem anything like the size of the Turin Shroud.\"This is FALSE. As shown (outlined in green) on my \"My critique of \"The Pray Codex,\" Wikipedia, 1 May 2011,\" the Pray Codex's (Berkovits, 1969, plate III, upper) Shroud is \"about 3.0 times Jesus' body, compared to the Shroud of Turin's about 2.4 times the length of Jesus' body.\">Comment:Why didn't the illustrator show the image of Christ on the Shroud? I don't know! But I can only hypothesize. Most significantly, the size of the Pray Manuscript is very small and it would have been very hard for the artist to meaningfully depict Jesus's image at this scale.Yes. As previously pointed out, the artist used \"artistic license\" to include Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and John in the entombment of Jesus by draping the Shroud around them. But to fit all this within a portrait mode illuminated manuscript miniature forced the artist to depict the Shroud about 25% longer than it is.>There is also the question of HOW he would depict what is a very faint image. I believe the Shroud image of Jesus is symbolically represented by the cross motifs near the angel's foot, and this is an easy way to get around both the scale issue as well as the faint image issue.As previously mentioned, IMO many elements of the Pray Codex's Entombment and Visit to the Sepulchre scenes (Berkovits plate III) depict the Shroud symbolically.>Freeman goes on:>>\"The most important point of all is that a blown-up image shows that the sudarium is depicted as a separate piece of cloth and so the source seems, once again, to be the account in John's gospel where the sudarium is reported as lying separately. This cannot be the Turin Shroud! The usual practice of taking the gospel accounts as an inspiration seems to have been followed here.\"If Freeman is talking about the image of Jesus' head in profile near Mary Magdalene's right arm, then that is self-evidently NOT the Sudarium (i..e. \"the face cloth [Gk. soudarion], which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself\" in John 20:7). First, a face cloth would not show the features of Jesus' face; and second, the scene being depicted is not John 20:7, which involved Peter and John but no angel, but rather Mark 16:5-6:\"5 And entering the tomb, they [Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome-v.1] saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. 6 And he said to them, `Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here.

Agreed. >If it is a sarcophagus lid then what are the two red stripes? And is it mere coincidence that the red stripes and the 4 holes are located adjacent to the cross like motifs, echoing the blood images on the Shroud image and the holes just to its side?It is difficult to untangle the artist's combined symbolism. I interpret it that the empty sarcophagus and lid, decorated with the Shroud's `poker holes,' weave and bloodstains, with the empty graveclothes emerging from the sarcophagus, and the face of Jesus in profile near Mary Magdalene's arm, TOGETHER depict the Empty Tomb and the Shroud COMBINED.>BUT Freeman has actually done our case a great service.

He is so prejudiced against the Shroud's authenticity that he REFUSES TO SEE the obvious symbolic elements of the Shroud in the Pray Codex's artwork.

However, let us start with what would be obvious to anyone who had seen the Shroud, the size of the cloth and the two images. So to turn to the Pray Codex, it shows Christ being laid onto a shroud, which, in traditional Jewish style, as recorded in John’s gospel, reaches only to his shoulders. This is false on two counts. First, a Jewish shroud doubled as a bed sheet, so it could have been double a man's length. Second, there is no necessity for the Shroud to have been specifically intended as a burial sheet. Although English translations say that \"Joseph bought a linen shroud\" [Gk. sindon]:Mk 15:46. \"And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock.\"it is the same Greek word that Mark uses in the previous chapter for the \"linen cloth\" that a \"young man\" (probably himself) was solely wearing (presumably his bed sheet):Mk 14:51. \"And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth [Gk. sindon] about his body. And they seized him,\"So the Shroud that Joseph of Arimathea bought to bury Jesus in, was a large linen sheet that could have been used for any purpose, including making clothes, soft furnishings, a burial shroud, etc.>>There does seem to be some sort of fold under the buttocks but hardly enough to make up the size of the Turin Shroud. This is true. But as I have pointed out elsewhere, that appears to be a garment with two halves, with an opening for the neck and ties across the shoulders. It is therefore is not the Shroud. But we should remember that the Pray Codex artist probably was not an expert in first century Jewish burial garments, and since both Luke and John (Lk 24:12; Jn 20:6-7) refer to \"linen cloths\" plural [Gk. othonia] there is no Biblical reason why Jesus could not have been laid on a garment.>>Surely anyone knowing the Turin Shroud would have shown it with the top half of the Shroud above his head ready to be folded back over the body and fixed at the feet.Why? Again there is no reason to think that the Pray Codex's artist was an expert in Jewish burials. And even if he was, the artist does show the Shroud, but around Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and John, and that evidently was his artistic priority, to depict their involvement in Jesus' burial. >>Then the Turin Shroud shows a bearded Christ, this illustration does not, unless it is a very light beard.\"As I pointed out in my post, \"My critique of `The Pray Codex,'Wikipedia, 1 May 2011,\" the Christ of the Pray Codex does have a beard, albeit a light one. And the reason for that may be traditional, cultural and/or even medieval Christian anti-Semitism. The Apostle John is depicted with no beard at all, yet Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus are depicted with full Jewish beards.It could even be due to the artist's misinterpretation, since the beard on the Shroud Man is faint.[continued]","date":"July 18, 2012 at 5:49 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-turin.html","title":"My critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey,\" part 1: \"Introduction\""},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Gio>It's odd. From the little I've read of him, Mr. (Dr.?) Freeman always rubbed off as a relatively honest historian, at least for somebody who writes on the topics he does with the views he does.Freeman may well be an honest historian generally. I wouldn't know because I haven't read his other work, except his review of de Wesselow's \"The Sign\".But I do claim that in this paper of his that I am critiquing, Freeman is dishonest in concealing from his readers evidence that undermines his thesis: that the Shroud of Turin is just another fake relic. >But this piece seems largely polemical, especially when he starts with as blatant a falsehood as that interest in the Shroud has been confined to the last 50 years!Freeman doesn't actually say that. What he wrote was:\"Relic cults come and go and the Turin Shroud is very much a cult of the past fifty years, not a medieval one.\"But this is remarkable imprecise for a historian to whom chronological accuracy should be very important. The \"past fifty years\" is since 1962. But what happened in 1962 that was significant regarding the Shroud? NOTHING as far as I am aware. As is borne out by Ian Wilson's \"Highlights of the Undisputed History: 1900's\" on Shroud.com:-----------------------------------December 17, 1961: Death of Dr. Pierre Barbet.June 16-18 1969: On the orders of Turin's Cardinal Michele Pellegrino, the Shroud is secretly taken out of its casket for its state of preservation to be studied by a team of experts. These examine, photograph and discuss for three days, but do no direct testing. During this same period, and with the Shroud hung vertically for the purpose, Giovanni Battista Judica-Cordiglia takes the first ever Shroud photo in color, also fresh black and white ones, and ones by Woods light.-----------------------------------If by \"a cult\" Freeman means the renewed modern scientific interest in the Shroud, then, apart from it being an inversion of the truth, it is historically false. As I pointed out in my post above, the modern scientific interest in the Shroud began in 1898, when Secondo Pia photographed the Shroud and discovered that it was a photographic negative!:-----------------------------------\"Highlights of the Undisputed History: 1800's\"May 28, 1898: Public exhibition. Secondo Pia, an Italian amateur photographer, makes the first photograph of the Shroud of Turin. It ushers in a new era in the Shroud's history, the era of science.-----------------------------------But Freeman is here not interested in historical truth. What he is attempting to do in this paper is to \"poison the well\" against the authenticity of the Shroud:\"Poisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a rhetorical device where adverse information about a target is pre-emptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can be a special case of argumentum ad hominem ... The origin of the term lies in well poisoning, an ancient wartime practice of pouring poison into sources of fresh water before an invading army in order to diminish the invading army's strength.\" (\"Poisoning the well,\" Wikipedia, 4 February 2012).so that his readers won't bother checking for themselves the evidence for the Shroud's authenticity - which is overwhelming!Stephen E.

Although I basically agree with Freeman's critique of that part of de Wesselow's \"The Sign\" which attempts to explain away the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus that they were really the disciples looking at the image on the Shroud.>Why is it when Atheists like Freeman ask for evidence and get it that completely ignore the scientific evidence and turn all pseudo-scientific on us. I truely believe that they must reject the shroud at all costs because of the strong evidence for authenticity.Atheists are like cultists (or actually ARE cultists) whose minds have been made captive to a philosophy:Colossians 2:8. \"See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.\"namely Naturalism (nature is all there is-there is no supernatural). It is a very powerful cultism in that: 1) it is held by some of the best and brightest; 2) it has brought great material benefits in science and technology; and 3) it is not recognised to be a cult by those whose minds Naturalism has captured.But there is absolutely no reason why Christian Theism cannot be true. Then what is true in Naturalism is just a subset of Christian Theism.And the Shroud of Turin is just another piece of the empirical evidence that Christian Theism is true, which God has graciously granted to those whose minds are not closed to receive it.>Even when googling about the shroud I couldn't believe all of the nonsensical information on the skeptical websites I have seen. I haven't read much of them, but what I have read, I agree is largely nonsensical. A major problem for Shroud anti-authenticists is that few (if any of them) have invested in buying and reading Shroud pro-authenticist books.They are therefore largely dependent on Shroud anti-authenticist websites and discussion forums. But that is just a case of \"the blind leading the blind\" (Matthew 15:14).>Back in 2009 I was totally ignorant of the shroud and thought it was just some relic. Ironically it was the atheist funded and failed replication of the shroud , and all of the hoopla that surrounded it worldwide that got me to take a deeper look into it.Great!>Thank God for websites such as yours that actually study the relevant info pertaining to the shroud.Indeed, to God be all the thanks.

And that is the Shroud is a VAST field, requiring a HUGE investment in time and money to keep up with (let alone to master), and which no Shroud anti-authenticist, including Freeman, is prepared to pay.

Which would be necessary after that trial by fire, if a red-hot poker was thrust through it, into the Shroud beneath.>Just theorising here, but maybe the Sakli image, as a later image of the Image of Edessa, shows the poker holes where earlier depictions don't, because the poker holes were created some time between the earlier depictions and the Sakli depiction?That is possible. Or maybe the Sakli image is a more faithful representation of the Mandylion's post-680 trial by fire protective surrounds?The Sakli church is deep within Turkey (check out the location of \"Goreme\" on Google maps).

In fact it cannot be done and arrive after a doubling in four with a landscape mode of a head with the space around the head that the Mandylion copies depict (e.g. at St Catherine's Monastery, and the Sakli Church) without starting with a cloth about the same length and width of the Shroud.Starting with the about 4.4 x 1.1 metre Shroud, 4 x 2 = 8 halvings yields a cloth 4.4/8 = 0.55 x 1.1 metres or 1.1 x 0.55 metres with the head in about 1:2 landscape mode.Again, I would like to wind up these comments which have strayed far from my original Lombatti post (by allowing this I am indicating that I will in future more flexible on what \"off topic\" means).I would appreciate new comments to be on Charles Freeman's paper under my \"My critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey.\"Stephen E.

According to Poulle, Chevalier deliberately did not correctly mention the Papal bulls of antipope Clement VII issued in 1390. In fact Clement VII never opted for the forgery thesis.\" (\"Ulysse Chevalier,\" Wikipedia, 2 June 2014). And in fact Chevalier's intellectual dishonesty regarding the Shroud, was much worse than that. He forged a crucial heading to Bishop Pierre d'Arcis 1389 Memorandum that wasn't there. Read Markwardt, J., 2001, \"The Conspiracy Against the Shroud,\" BSTS Newsletter, No. 55, June 2002).Fr Herbert Thurston (1856–1939) was another Roman Catholic leading opponent of the Shroud, although Wikipedia doesn't say much about that:\"Fr. Herbert Henry Charles Thurston, S.J. (15 November 1856 – 3 November 1939) was an English priest of the Roman Catholic Church, a member of the Jesuit order, and a prolific scholar on liturgical, literary, historical, and spiritual matters. ... In his day, he was considered something of an expert on spiritualism. ... Thurston wrote more than 150 articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia (1907-1914) [including the online article on the Shroud of Turin]... He was a close friend of the Modernist theologian, Father George Tyrrell, who was harshly sanctioned by the Church. Many of Thurston's articles show a skeptical attitude ... about holy relics [especially the Shroud of Turin] and his treatment of spiritualism and the paranormal was regarded as `too sympathetic' by some sections of the Catholic community.\" (\"Herbert Thurston,\" Wikipedia, 8 October 2014. My words in square brackets)Read Markwardt BSTS article above for details of Thurston's intellectual dishonesty also in further `improving' on Chevalier's already `improved' d'Arcis Memorandum.>I never knew about the shroud until 2009 and I found out about it from atheists of all people . Oh the ironyWhen I `discovered' the Shroud in 2005 and posted a comment to a news article about it shortly after, on my now closed CreationEvolutionDesign Yahoo group, I found the atheists in the group knew a lot about it. Having only read Stevenson & Habermas' 1981 \"Verdict on the Shroud\" I didn't know anything about the Shroud's 1988 C14 dating, but I was in the midst of my Bachelor of Science degree, so I answered them using what I knew about C14 dating in general, until I could catch up on my reading about that.Stephen E.

I really think what we have here are 2 possibilities .>>1. They have a very liberal theology kind of stance towards the supernatural orFrom what I have read of Chevalier and Thurston, they were `progressive' Catholics who sought to rid the Catholic Church of its links with `embarrassing' medieval relics.They had their contemporary counterparts in liberal Protestant theologians who wanted to rid the Protestant Church of links to `embarrassing'  Biblical miracles.I don't disagree that most RC relics are fakes and it is dishonest that the Vatican refuses to state which relics are authentic, like the Shroud, and which are fakes. But the problem with Chevalier and Thurston is that they sought to `throw out the baby with the bathwater.\" Indeed, they LIED in order to discredit the Shroud, which shows that concern for truth was not what motivated them.>2. They are afraid of being embarrassed in front of their materialistically leaning colleagues .That may have been true at the beginning of their careers, but so powerful is the indoctrination in Naturalism in Science, and Academia generally (including many theological colleges), that from my experience of over a decade (1984-2005) debating Creation/Evolution, these `Theistic Naturalists' are VERY enthusiastic in denying the supernatural, even Biblical miracles.>It's clear that something emotional is motivating this anti authenticity or anti super naturalism bias of theirs.The emotion probably comes from the inner tension of trying to serve two incompatible masters. Mt 6:24: \"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.\"in this case supernatural Biblical Christianity and Naturalism (\"nature is all there is: there is no supernatural\").And so Christians like me, who try to be consistent supernaturalists (i.e. accept supernatural causation when the evidence points to it and naturalistic explanations don't work), presumably make them feel guilty deep-down, which is why the Fence-Sitter and his `Christian' ilk are so opposed to me, and tolerant of, if not actually on the side of, Anti-Christians like Charles Freeman.It doesn't bother me, indeed on the contrary it confirms to me that I am on the right track:Jn 15:18-20: 18 \"If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. 19 If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. 20 Remember the word that I said to you: `A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.\"And I know that if they don't repent, the Lord with repay them for any evil:Rom 12:19. \"Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, `Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.'\"they have directed at me for simply seeking to serve Jesus as the Man on the Shroud.[continued]","date":"November 3, 2014 at 8:43 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","title":"My critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]>Hughes slandering posts and then his inability to back them up just smacks of hidden intentions and diversionary tactics.I presume you mean Hugh Farey?

But:\"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\" (McQuarrie C., 1996, \"The Usual Suspects,\" Faber & Faber: London, p.89)!>I usually see these tactics by pseudo skeptics not from believers.What makes you think they are CHRISTIAN \"believers\"? Again, \"don't believe what people SAY. Believe only in what they DO.\"And what they DO is act like anti-Christian \"skeptics\" as you noted.And oppose me, who seeks to be a consistent Biblical Christian, in my support of the authenticity of the Shroud, and they support ANTI-Christians like Charles Freeman.Jesus warned that there would be MANY on the Day of Judgement who THOUGHT they were Christians but WERE NOT:Mt 7:21-23. \"Not everyone who says to me, `Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one WHO DOES THE WILL OF MY FATHER who is in heaven. 22 On that day MANY will say to me, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' 23 And then will I declare to them, `I NEVER KNEW YOU; depart from me, you WORKERS OF LAWLESSNESS.'\" (my emphasis).Who are those \"many\" if it does not include them?

Art historian Thomas de Wesselow says in his book, \"The Sign\" (2012) that the modern art world simply ignores the Shroud, as though it doesn't exist. But as John Walsh pointed out, the Shroud is either authentic, or it is the greatest work of art of all time:\" Only this much is certain: The Shroud of Turin is either the most awesome and instructive relic of Jesus Christ in existence-showing us in its dark simplicity how He appeared to men-or it is one of the most ingenious, most unbelievably clever, products of the human mind and hand on record.

However, Wilson in 1998 (see below) says the 1997 fire was arson. Here are quotes about the 1997 fire on my system mentioning \"arson\" (my emphases below):\"Then, in the hour before the midnight of April 11, came the highly publicised fire. Although the Shroud itself was saved, all that had been its environs during the last four hundred years lay a tangled, blackened and water-drenched mess. The once gleaming bullet-proof display case had had to be most energetically smashed in order for the Shroud to be rescued. Where once there had been a three hundred year old wall of glass separating the Royal Chapel from the main body of the Cathedral there was now empty space. The Royal Chapel's dome was now in a far more dangerous state than before the restoration work began. Worst affected of all was the actual lining of the walls of the Royal Chapel. Likewise the adjoining part of the Royal Palace where STURP did its testing work in 1978, much of its splendid baroque ornament and valuable paintings having been ruined beyond repair. And BEHIND THE WHOLE EPISODE LAY THE DARK SPECTRE OF ARSON and sabotage on the part of as yet unidentified enemies of the Shroud, the Church and all that these represent. ... The Cause of the fire. According to the latest available information, as given at a Press Conference on 24 April, the exact cause of the fire is not yet known. However an overloading of the Palace electrical circuits has been ruled out, and ARSON SEEMS STRONGLY SUSPECTED. Some reports have spoken of a cryptic telephoned warning shortly beforehand, also signs that it started seemingly in two separate places at the same time (i) in wooden and aluminium scaffolding just above the roof of the passageway connecting the palace with the Royal Chapel, and (ii) inside the Chapel itself. The finding of a discarded petrol can has also been mentioned. The difficulty lies choosing between the several plausible categories of possible suspects. ... Whoever was responsible, if the fire was arson, then it will certainly not have been the first attempt to destroy the Shroud is this way. There was another in 1972, in which an intruder broke into the Royal Chapel after climbing over the Palace roof.\" (Wilson, I., 1997, \"Editorial: When Everything Seems Against You...,\" BSTS Newsletter, No: 45, June/July).[continued]","date":"November 3, 2014 at 11:22 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","title":"My critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">I haven't read The Fence-Sitter's blog since 8th May, ...The Lord spoke to me in my quiet time this morning, that I should cease mentioning Dan Porter (aka \"The Fence-Sitter\"), and his blog, in my blog.He can attack me all he likes, but I will from now on ignore him and his blog, unless he or any of his blog's members make comments on this my blog.So mentioning of Dan Porter, and his blog, and his blog's members in connection with Porter's blog, is henceforth off-topic on my blog.Stephen E.

Ruling out massive objective evidence for the Shroud's authenticity on the basis of one's own private visions is just self-delusion, or worse.>This is ridiculous because Christ made himself known in a very powerful way when he appeared post resurrection to his disciples and 500 people.That wouldn't preclude Christ making Himself known to people thereafter - indeed the New Testament contains several examples: the Ascension (Acts 1:6 - unless that was the appearance to the 500 brothers); Stephen (Acts 7:55-56); Paul (Acts 9:4; 1Cor 15:8), Peter ( Acts 10:9-16), John (Rev 1:12-17) - up to and including today.

Except that Farey with his \"an accidental 14th century origin\" of the Shroud:\"Unlike my predecessors, whom I think are more or less committed to a pro-authenticity point of view, I myself currently incline more towards an accidental 14th century origin for the cloth now preserved in Turin.\" (\"Editorial - by Hugh Farey,\" BSTS Newsletter No. 78 - December 2013)is even more an extreme anti-authenticist than Freeman, who at least believes that the Shroud was forged by an unknown 14th century painter.

It is the EVIDENCE that matters.>It took me 2 years to even consider having an opinion on the shroud, and when I first studied it I made myself only visit anti authenticist shroud sites to make sure I wasn't wasting my time researching the shroud. It took Shroud.com's Barrie Schwortz 17 years:\"Mr Schwortz referred to the scientific evidence that is `the basis for my opinion that the shroud cannot be an artwork. STURP's data provided empirical evidence to that effect, although the sceptics of the world continue to deny it'. He continued: `Remember that I am Jewish (not Messianic), and it took nearly 17 years after our direct examination of the cloth before the scientific evidence actually convinced me of the shroud's authenticity. It was the science that did it.\" (Barrett, D.V., \"Expert dismisses historian's claim that Turin Shroud was made for medieval ritual,\" Catholic Herald, 29 October 2014).>So no, not all people on both sides embrace any theory as true.Agreed.>Im sure it took Stephen jones even longer to come to a conclusion on the shroud, not without much research and contemplation. Actually, after I was midway through reading Stevenson & Habermas' book, \"Verdict on the Shroud\" (1981), in January 2005, which only took a few days, I provisionally accepted the Shroud was authentic, subject to it passing the tests of further evidence. Which is still my position today. Except that after 9 years of continually exposing myself to all the evidence for and against the Shroud, and it passing all tests with flying colours, it is extremely unlikely that there is any evidence out there that would negate the MOUNTAIN of evidence for the Shroud's authenticity that I now know.Indeed, the WEAKNESS of the LEADING anti-authenticist's (like Freeman) evidence and arguments is itself evidence that the Shroud is authentic. They are these days just a RABBLE of mutually CONTRADICTORY theories (e.g. Freeman's 14th century painter and Farey's 14th century accident), who are united only in their antipathy towards the authenticity of the Shroud!Stephen E.

It is still PREPOSTEROUS that the Shroud's image could have resulted from \"the accidental result of the passage of time on some other image.\"Microscopic and ultraviolet, etc, examinations of the Shroud by STURP, and others, have failed to find any evidence of an original image on the Shroud, and they would have found evidence of it if it had been there.Also you simply ignore all the historical and artistic evidence for the Shroud's existence well before the 14th century and all the way back to the 1st century.You HAVE TO be biased against the Shroud's authenticity to do that.The evidence is so strong for the Shroud's authenticity that even agnostics like Thomas de Wesselow and Ian Wilson, have been forced by that evidence to accept that the Shroud is authentic. And I myself, an evangelical Protestant, who had no reason to believe a `Roman Catholic medieval relic,' as I regarded the Shroud to be, was authentic, was also forced by the evidence to accept that it is. And do you really think that Jesus, who is ruling over all (Acts 10:36; Rom 9:5; Eph 1:21-22; Php 2:9), would allow millions of Christians down through the ages (including me) to be fooled by such a convincing \"accident\"?[continued]","date":"October 31, 2014 at 12:23 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/10/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-claim.html","title":"My critique of Charles Freeman's claim that the Turin Shroud was made for a medieval Easter ritual"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"There was nothing “libellous” about my comment to Dan that a US court has ruled that “copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected `fair use’ of the copyrighted material.” That ruling would seem to apply to Colin’s accusation of “piracy” against Dan because Dan copied some online content from Colin’s blog.

Those who study this piece of cloth grandly call themselves sindonologists, as if concocting crackpot theories about a 13th or 14th century hoax were a legitimate branch of academia. Their high priest is one Ian Wilson, who the BBC flatteringly refers to as a \"historian\".Quite why Wilson deserves this job description is unclear, because his works have little to do with history, and instead are books that hail from a strange sector of publishing nicely captured by Peter Wilson in The Independent in 2001:Pick an ancient riddle to unravel. Mix together a pinch of history, a splash of archaeology, a soupçon of theology, lashings of first-person travelogue and a hefty dose of maps. Then flavour it with talk of the pyramids, the Inca sacred sites, the truth behind the Bible and obstructive, conspiratorial clerics. Finally, garnish in a bold cover with gold letters and a sensational title about a lost civilisation, a missing continent or extra-terrestrial life. Watch the copies walk out of the bookshops.A look at Wilson's back catalogue sheds little light on why he should be labelled a historian. My favourites are The Turin Shroud: The Burial Cloth of Jesus Christ? (1979); The Evidence of the Shroud (1986); Holy Faces, Secret Places: An Amazing Quest for the Face of Jesus (1991); The Blood and the Shroud: New Evidence That the World's Most Sacred Relic Is Real (1998); The Turin Shroud: Unshrouding the Mystery (2000); and his latest shlockbuster, The Shroud : the 2000-Year-Old Mystery Solved (2010). Are you spotting a patten here?Wilson has also written about stigmata, reincarnation, and yep, you guessed it, Nostradamus. It's clear that Wilson's \"historical\" enquiries are little more than excuses to peddle the type of bilge that appeals to those who believe in The Da Vinci Code. I don't have time to read Wilson's books, but it's clear from their reviews that his imagination easily outstrips that of Dan Brown. For example, in Before the Flood (2001), Wilson speculates on the existence of Atlantis. But my favourite is The Blood and the Shroud, in which Wilson wonders whether the resurrection of Jesus took the form of a small thermonuclear reaction that corrupted the carbon-dating tests made on the Shroud.You couldn't make it up. Neither could I. But Mr Wilson can.© 2010----------------------------------","date":"August 5, 2016 at 9:25 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2010/04/ian-wilsons-turin-shroud-theories-are.html","title":"`Ian Wilson's Turin Shroud theories are the worst kind of junk history'"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"And this is Ian Wilson's response to Walters' critique, which also is no longer online, but I also had saved it as a text file.----------------------------------Telegraph.co.ukMy response to Guy Walters and his critiquePublished: 5:19PM BST 15 Apr 2010 Surprising as it may seem, I share Guy Walters' frustrations at \"the enormous amount of junk history around\". This therefore makes it all the more galling that Walters should have chosen me, Ian Wilson, as his number one target, lumping my books into this category without, on his own admission, having bothered to read a single word of them.  By Ian Wilson, M.A. (Oxon.)The first rule of the professional historian is surely to familiarise himself with what he is writing about, thus avoiding the sort of \"ignorance and misconceptions\" that Walters says he so abhors. Yet Walters clearly saw no need to follow this rule when he rushed out his blog about me, condemning my standards as a professional author. First, Walters questioned my right to be \"labelled a historian\". The facts are that I am a history graduate of Magdalen College, Oxford, where I studied under A.J.P.Taylor and others. I graduated with honours in 1963, and was conferred an M.A. in 1977. Walters fails to mention the historical biography of Shakespeare, Shakespeare: The Evidence, which I wrote in 1994. No-nonsense Oxford historian the late Dr. A.L.Rowse, reviewed this in the London Evening Standard as: \"Full of good sense. The reader will not go wrong with it  Ian Wilson is conscientious, as a good Oxford man should be.\" Second, and compounding his ignorance, Walters has assumed that I must be a card-carrying adherent of every topic that I write about. Had he actually consulted the books he might have found this to be very far from the case. In my book on reincarnation (Mind out of Time? 1981), I debunked the then popular myth that hypnotic regression could lead back to past incarnations. In Stigmata I showed this phenomenon to have a psychological rather than any spiritual origination. In Nostradamus: The Evidence I expressly showed the falsity of Nostradamus' prophetic reputation. Third, Walters is completely misinformed in supposing that Before the Flood speculated on the existence of Atlantis. I am no more a believer in Atlantis than Walters is. Likewise my The Blood and the Shroud did not argue for a \"thermonuclear reaction\" having corrupted the carbon-dating texts. Nor in four decades of Shroud researches have I ever called myself a \"sindonologist\", a term I dislike as much as he does. Professing Christianity these days does not court popularity, and some of the subjects that I write about are undeniably controversial. However if Mr. Walters actually deigned to read my latest book The Shroud, published last month by Bantam Press, he would see that, although it is directed to the general reader, I maintain the critical standards appropriate to a trained historian. The extensive historical references that I have cited are not the garbage sources that typify true \"junk history\". They are solid academic publications in every instance. Mr.Walters has acted recklessly and in complete ignorance - thereby abandoning his own professed historical standards. © 2010----------------------------------","date":"August 5, 2016 at 10:01 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2010/04/ian-wilsons-turin-shroud-theories-are.html","title":"`Ian Wilson's Turin Shroud theories are the worst kind of junk history'"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Anonymous>You raise some fine points, but frustratingly neglect the role of bias in judging the usefulness and reliability of historians and their contributions.

I didn't see it. But Jackson's paper I posted predicts that any reverse side image would be \"less intense\":\"It is likely, however, that if a frontal image discoloration exists on the reverse surface of the Shroud, it would be somewhat less intense than the discoloration which is observed on the normal viewing side because that side presumably entered the body first.\"Besides, it is not necessarily so that \"the image on the reverse side of the Shroud contains ... not the rest of the body.\"The second image's discoverer, Prof. Giulio Fanti, says that a second image of the rest of the body may be there, but \"masked by the noise of the digital [sic. frontal?] image itself\":\"`Though the image is very faint, features such as nose, eyes, hair, beard and moustache are clearly visible. There are some slight differences with the known face. For example, the nose on the reverse side shows the same extension of both nostrils, unlike the front side, in which the right nostril is less evident,' Fanti said. But the enhancing procedure did not uncover the full body image as it appeared on the front side. `If it does exist, it is masked by the noise of the digital image itself. But we found what it is probably the image of the hands,' Fanti said.\" (\"Turin shroud shows another mystery face,\" (Rossella Lorenzi, Discovery News/ABC Science, 12 April 2004).Since Jackson's theory is that the intensity of the image is a function of how long was the time a body part fell through the radiation:\"The initial draping configuration of the Shroud over a body establishes the initial cloth-body distances. If, then, the Shroud overlying the body falls into the body region, different points on the cloth will intersect the body surface at different times depending upon how far that point was originally away from the body. Thus, each cloth point will receive a radiation dose in proportion to the time that it is inside the emitting body region.\"the head and hands would be expected to show up more clearly on the reverse image because they were the highest body parts of the Man in the Shroud (due to His bent forward crucifixion position, fixed by rigor mortis) and therefore they received the most radiation.Stephen E.

Could I please have a link or reference to where:“Linda T.  writes that Stephen Jones, by the way he quoted Mark Guscin, gives the impression that Kim Dreisbach stated that travertine aragonite is further proof that the Shroud is that of Jesus.” so that I can see for myself what she claims is the problem caused by my inserting ellipses into the quote?Here is my quote at http://members.iinet.net.au/~sejones/quotes/TSoT/stuc0706.html being referred to:“I wrote to the Rev A Dreisbach of the AICCSST (Atlanta International Centre for Continuing Study and Exhibit of the Shroud of Turin) to see if he knew anything about the carbon dating of the sudarium in Arizona. Unfortunately, his answer was negative … However, he did make some other very interesting points. In relation to the dust particles on the nasal area of the Shroud, he mentions an analysis carried out on particles from the foot area. He says: `microscopic dirt particles taken from the foot area during the 1978 examination were eventually analysed by Joseph Kohlbek at the Hercules Aerospace Laboratory in Salt Lake City, Utah and found to be travertine aragonite – a rare form of calcite also found near the Damascus Gate (i.e. the one closest to Golgotha) in Jerusalem. That finding was later confirmed by Dr Levi Setti using an electron probe microscope at the Enrico Fermi Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois.’ This interesting information is further proof that the Shroud is that of Jesus, because no forger, either pious or impious, nobody who made a portrait of Christ, for whatever reason, would ever think of including such details, which would have been ignored anyway until this present age with its microscopic possibilities.” (Guscin, M., “The Oviedo Cloth,” Lutterworth Press: Cambridge UK, 1998, pp.78-79)The words of Dreisbach’s that I left out and replaced by ellipses in the above quote were: “I regret that I am not informed about the details of Dr Baima Ballone’s `highly contaminated’ sample of the Oviedo Cloth which he had sent as gas in leaky capsules to Dr Paul Damon at Tucson. My best guess would be that he acquired them in 1994 when he was present in Oviedo with that group and Alan Whanger, M.D. of Duke University.”As can be seen, this has nothing to do with the issue of “travertine aragonite – a rare form of calcite also found near the Damascus Gate (i.e. the one closest to Golgotha) in Jerusalem” being found near the feet area of the Shroud, which was the topic of my quote.As can also be seen above is that I added single quotation marks that were not in Guscin’s book to make it clear where Dreisbach’s words ended and Guscin’s began.Stephen E.

His name appears first on the 1989 Nature article of those from Oxford: “… C.R. Bronk,3 E. T. Hall,3 R. E. M. Hedges, 3 R. Housley,3 I. A. Law,3 C. Perry,3 … 3 – Research Laboratory for Archaeology and History of Art, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX1 3QJ, UK …”As such he would have been aware that a 200X microscope examination of the Shroud sample provided to Oxford revealed that it contained cotton which “may have been used for repairs at some time in the past”:“COTTON ON THE OXFORD CARBON DATING SAMPLE Kindly brought to our attention by the Revd. Kim Dreisbach of Atlanta is a hitherto unnoticed report in the journal Textile Horizons of December 1988 concerning the Shroud sample supplied to the Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratory. Apparently the British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd of Ambergate, Derbyshire was asked by the Oxford laboratory to help identify certain ‘foreign’ fibres observed, isolated and extracted from the Shroud sample prior to its destruction during the carbon dating process. According to Precision Processes managing director, Peter South: `It was while the sample was undergoing tests at the radiocarbon acceleration unit in Oxford that Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place. He mentioned this to his friend Sir James Spooner, chairman of Coats Viyella, to which our firm belongs. Consequently, after several telephone calls, the minute samples, which looked like human hair, were sent to us.’ Magnified two hundred times by a Precision Processes microscope the fibres became immediately identified as cotton. … Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.” (Wilson, I., “Cotton on the Oxford Carbon Dating Sample,” British Society for the Turin Shroud Newsletter, No. 26, September/October 1990, pp.7-8). But Oxford’s problem was that the Tucson Arizona lab had already run its carbon dating test on 6 May 1988, which dated the Shroud at 1350 AD. Then the Zurich lab had run its test nearly 3 weeks later on 26 May, which agreed with Tucson’s date. Oxford eventually submitted its results on 8 August, over 3 months after Tucson’s. So if the cotton was part of a medieval repair and Oxford had removed it, and then dated the remaining pure linen, and the result then was that the date of Oxford’s sample was now much older than that of the other two labs, it would be a major scientific embarrassment, and a public relations disaster for the new AMS method of radiocarbon dating. In that case, what would a young scientist entrusted with such a major radiocarbon dating do? Announce that the other two labs had badly bungled their tests? Or run a carbon dating on another of their several sub-samples, complete with cotton, which would give a date broadly in agreement with the other two labs?If something like this did happen, it would explain why Ramsey/Bronk would have to defend the consensus radiocarbon dating of 1260-1390AD, unless something like Jackson’s carbon monoxide contamination theory gave all three labs an honourable way out. But to admit that the labs tested a cotton-contaminated patch of the Shroud would not be an honourable way out. Especially as Oxford knew that their sample was contaminated with cotton.","date":"January 1, 2012 at 9:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/01/di-lazzaros-gambit/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Di Lazzaro’s Gambit"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"It is worth noting that the ” C.R.

But there is a problem explaining how he could hack into Zurich and Oxford's computers. Given that Profs. Jull and Ramsey stated that those computers were never online.I have thought of several ways that Linick could have done it manually, and one of those ways involves Koch.I will document the above from sources. Although I don't yet have a `smoking gun' clue that PROVES: 1) that the 3 labs were hacked; 2) that Linick was a hackers; and 3) that Koch was the other hacker involved in the C14 dating. I am in the position that a police detective would be in the early stage of a crime investigation. I have a lot of circumstantial evidence that points to a crime having been committed and I have two suspects. But unlike a detective I have no authority or ability to further investigate the crime by visiting the crime scenes and asking questions of those who would be in a position to know more information that would either confirm or refute my suspicions.>Any honest seeker or researcher has to concede this when going through the maintains software evidences for the shroud's authenticity .Agreed. But as the agnostic pro-authenticist anatomy Professor Yves Delage pointed out in 1902, \"If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person ... no one would have thought of making any objection\": \"I willingly recognize that none of these given arguments offer the features of an irrefutable demonstration; but it must be recognized that their whole constitutes a bundle of imposing probabilities, some of which are very near being proven ... a religious question has been needlessly injected into a problem which in itself is purely scientific, with the result that feelings have run high, and reason has been led astray. IF, INSTEAD OF CHRIST, THERE WERE A QUESTION OF SOME PERSON LIKE A SARGON, AN ACHILLES OR ONE OF THE PHARAOHS, NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF MAKING ANY OBJECTION ... I have been faithful to the true spirit of science in treating this question, intent only on the truth, not concerned in the least whether it would affect the interests of any religious party ...

They took the side of the atheists against their fellow Christians in arguing for FULLY NATURALISTIC evolution. It is of course POSSIBLE that God used a fully naturalistic process to originate and develop life, and also to create the image on the Shroud. But the EVIDENCE IS AGAINST both. But that does not matter to such Christian Naturalists. They argue for the Atheist side (or at least won't argue against it) and don't see any problem with providing God's enemies with ammunition to use against their fellow Christians. At best they are genuine Christians whose minds have been captured by the philosophy of Naturalism, as the Apostle Paul warned was possible:Col. 2:8. \" See to it that no one takes you captive by PHILOSOPHY and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world [Gk.

Linick and the German hacker Karl Koch, who confessed to working for the KGB. The latter's death on 1 June 1989 was contrived to look like suicide and it could only have been the KGB. And since Koch had already confessed all his selling of military and computer secrets to the KGB he must have been killed by them to prevent him confessing some different hacking for the KGB, which the KGB was much more concerned about. The KGB's involvement in the hacking of the Shroud's C14 dating fits that bill, and nothing else does. In 1988 the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, and it did collapse in 1989. The USSR and its Eastern Bloc satellites had HUGE Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox populations. A 1st or early century C14 dating of the Shroud would have been a nightmare scenario to that Atheist regime.If Linick has contacted the KGB offering to ensure the Shroud C14 dated to just before 1350, the KGB would have jumped at the chance.And Linick was found dead on 4 June 1989, in \"mysterious circumstances,\" and his death was suspected to have been suicide.But that was when Linick was FOUND dead. Allowing for the time zone differences between Germany and Arizona, it is possible that both Koch and Linick `committed suicide' on the SAME DAY, or at most only a few days apart. Also, after the first C14 dating of the Shroud to the `bull's eye' date of 1350, leaks to the media started which said the date was 1350. Ian Wilson later worked out that the Rev. David Sox, who was a former Secretary of the British Society of the Turin Shroud, but who had turned anti-authenticist, was the leaker to the media. But Sox was not in Arizona when the Shroud was dated, so the primary leaker to Sox had to be a member of Arizona lab's staff.And Sox actually published a book, \"The Shroud Unmasked: Uncovering the Greatest Forgery of All Time,\" in August 1988. Oxford did its dating on August 8, 1988, and there is no mention of Oxford's result in Sox's book. In that book, Sox quotes Linick, as being anti-authentist:\"The night before the test Damon told Gove he would not be surprised to see the analysis yield a date around the fifth-century, because after that time the crucifixion was banned and a forger would not have known of the details depicted so accurately on the Shroud. TIMOTHY LINICK, a University of Arizona research scientist, said: `IF WE SHOW THE MATERIAL TO BE MEDIEVAL THAT WOULD DEFINITELY MEAN THAT IT IS NOT AUTHENTIC. If we date it back 2000 years, of course, that still leaves room for argument. It would be the right age - but is it the real thing?'\" (Sox, H.D., 1988, \"The Shroud Unmasked: Uncovering the Greatest Forgery of All Time, p.147. My emphasis).Remember that Sox was not there in Arizona in May 1988 at their dating. And why would he quote Linick who was not one of the leaders of the Arizona labs? The simplest explanation is that Sox got his Arizona leaks from Linick. And if Linick was the hacker it would have been part of his plan to create a climate of expectation that the Shroud was dated about 1350.[continued]","date":"May 8, 2014 at 9:47 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-letter-from-alexius-comnenus-my.html","title":"\"The Letter from Alexius Comnenus\": My response to Dan Porter"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"Many thanks for this insightful article:)","date":"July 19, 2016 at 12:06 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2015/09/wasnt-jesus-body-washed-before-putting.html","title":"\"Wasn't Jesus' body washed before putting it in the grave?\""},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"[continued]And at worst they are not Christians at all, but are what the Apostle Paul called, \"FALSE [Gk. pseudo] BROTHERS\":2Cor 11:26. \"on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from FALSE BROTHERS;\"Gal 2:4.

I Googled on \"Stephen Jones Shroud\" for the past week to see if anyone was talking about my blog and I found this first few lines by Dan:\"In another blog Stephen Jones accuses me of being anti-authenticity. Take your pick. Would I rather know the truth about the shroud no matter what it is?\"Dan is deceiving himself. How LONG has he been studying the Shroud, and yet he STILL doesn't \"know the truth about\" it?! Clearly the problem is not the evidence but Dan's UNBELIEF in the bodily Resurrection of Christ, which Dan wrongly thinks is just a \"metaphor.\"Dan doesn't realise that STARTING from a position of unbelief, he will NEVER receive the inner assurance which comes from the Holy Spirit about the Resurrection of Christ, which then flows on to Dan's being against the authenticity of the Shroud.A few rare non-Christians, like Thomas de Wesselow, manage by mental gymnastics to believe in the authenticity of the Shroud, while rejecting the Resurrection of the Man on the Shroud. But they are the rare exceptions to the general rule that if you reject the Resurrection of Jesus, then to be consistent, you will also reject the authenticity of the Shroud. Dan evidently hoped that the Shroud would give him enough evidence to overcome his unbelief. But it doesn't work that way: \"A man convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still.\"And the problem is Dan's WILL. That is, the bottom line for Dan (and not only him but others like him) is that he doesn't WANT to believe in the Resurrection of Jesus and the authenticity of the Shroud.[continued]","date":"September 4, 2014 at 2:37 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2014/08/crispino-dorothy-1916-2014-turin-shroud.html","title":"Crispino, Dorothy (1916-2014): Turin Shroud Encyclopedia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"There is no such thing as neutrality towards Jesus.

That's why Dan works against me. Jesus' unconditional first demand is that non-Christians (including Dan) REPENT (Gk. metanoia = \"change your mind\" - an act of the will) and BELIEVE the good news:  Mk 1:14-15. 14 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, 15 and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel [Gk. evangelion = good news].”As all true Christians know, you must believe FIRST and then the Holy Spirit will help you to SEE what previously you were BLIND to. That's what the slave-trader John Newton testified to:Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,That saved a wretch like me.I once was lost but now am found,Was blind, but now I see.But if Dan continues to sit on the fence, regarding the Resurrection of Christ, and the authenticity of the Shroud, then James 1:6-8 states that as a \"double-minded man\" \"he will [not] receive anything from the Lord\":\"6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.\"And the eyes to see and the inner assurance that Jesus has indeed been raised bodily from the dead, are \"receive[d] ... from the Lord.\" They are not solely intellectual. >God bless you my friendThanks.

The MOUNTAIN of evidence that the Shroud existed well before 1260, indeed all the way back to the 1st century, is proof beyond REASONABLE doubt that the 1260-1390 = 1325 +/- 1325 radiocarbon date of the Shroud was WRONG.Indeed, as I have pointed out in my posts, \"My theory that the radiocarbon dating laboratories were duped by a computer hacker #5\" and #6, Table 2 of the 1989 Nature paper, with its admission, that: \"An initial inspection of Table 2 shows that the agreement among the three laboratories for samples 2, 3 and 4 [non-Shroud controls] is exceptionally good.  The spread of the measurements for sample 1 [the Shroud] is somewhat greater than would be expected from the errors quoted\" shows that the Shroud sample's dates were not real dates, but were computer-generated (e.g. by Timothy W. Linick's hacker program).Since samples 1 (the Shroud) and 2, 3 and 4 [non-Shroud controls] were all on the one ~26 mm or ~1 inch carousel wheel and each sample was irradiated in turn for 1 minute, the whole run taking 10 minutes, there is NO WAY that the Shroud samples could have a spread of different C14 dates AND \"the agreement among the three laboratories for samples 2, 3 and 4\" be \"exceptionally good.\"Something MAJOR must have gone wrong (e.g. the Shroud dates are not real dates but computer-generated), and the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud should have been declared FAILED.But the labs went too far out on a limb publicly to admit that, and so they HAD to pretend that the Shroud's dating was valid, when it WASN'T.

And what 14th century \"printing techniques\" can print an image on linen that is one flax cell wall (\"one fifth of a thousandth of a millimetre\" or 0.0002 mm) deep?

Science conferences don't allow theories to be presented that fly in the face of the vast majority of the known scientific evidence.

A particular oddity that he discovered of the Shroud `blood's' bile pigments was that these seemed to contain what he called `an extraordinarily high' level of the pigment bilirubin, giving rise to the question why this should be so. As he explained: `... a torture, scourging and crucifixion leading to shock - that would produce a tremendous hemolysis [break-up of red blood corpuscles-IW]. In less than 30 seconds the haemolyzed haemoglobin will run through the liver, building up a very high bilirubin. If that blood then clots the exudate forms, and all the intact cells with haemoglobin stay behind, only the haemolyzed goes out along with the serum albumin which bind the bilirubin. So what one ends up with on the cloth is an exudate which has an enhanced bilirubin index with respect to the haemolyzed haemoglobin. You now mix bilirubin which is yellow-orange with methaemoglobin in its para-hemic form, which is an orangey-brown, and you get blood which has a red colour.'\" (Wilson, I., 1998\"The Blood and the Shroud,\" p.89). Note that Adler's tests did find  \"an extraordinarily high\" level of bilirubin in Shroud blood.

However, another explanation for the red color may be due to Saponaria treatment of the cloth.\" (Zugibe, F.T., 2005, \"The Crucifixion of Jesus: A Forensic Inquiry,\" p.177).Of which there is experimental evidence by STURP:\"It is worth noting that, if the cloth was washed using soapwort, it might also help explain the reddish colour of the bloodstains, since Saponaria solutions are haemolytic, i.e. they break down red blood cells and release the haemoglobin. Apparently, this was tested before the STURP team went to Turin by applying blood to linen washed with soapwort, and twenty-five years later this blood was still red, whereas control samples on ordinary linen had turned black. This is an alternative explanation to that proposed by Adler, but it does not necessarily invalidate his conclusion that the blood belonged to a badly injured person.\" (de Wesselow, T., 2012, \"The Sign,\" p.111).Berry claims to be speaking for science, but since when is it scientific to:1. Depend on personal abuse to make up for the weakness of one's arguments?2. Fail to research thoroughly the literature of the hypothesis that one is attempting to refute?3. Ignore the mountain of other evidence in favour of the overall theory one is trying to refute, with a single \"molehill\" item of apparently contrary evidence?Science does not throw out a theory that is backed by a large number of different lines of evidence, because of one claimed problem. Rather what science does is try to reconcile the single problem with the large body of evidence for the theory.Berry's approach is the very antithesis of science! Stephen E.

It was obvious that the spectrum it produced did not match the spectrum of methemoglobin, at least as it is given in the standard references, which is a solution spectrum of blood. But in a film of hemoglobin there is a confirmation change; it no longer remains in the `met' form but goes to the para-hemic form. It is known now that there is a certain species which will spontaneously go to the para-hemic form if there is not enough turn-over in the spleen and the liver to process the blood fast enough. We found a spectrum that was characteristic of only one known group of compounds — the so-called high-spin, high-iron porphyrins. So instead of being wrong, the spectrum peaks were in the right place. What we were seeing was the breakdown products of hemoglobin — bilirubin and biliverdin. And one began to make sense out of all this. There is AN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH BILIRUBIN COUNT, almost as high as the methemoglobin. Now how does one account for such a high bilirubin in a person? One possibility is that the person had a severe malaria, but this does not seem very likely. But A TORTURE, SCOURGING AND CRUCIFIXION LEADING TO SHOCK — THAT WOULD PRODUCE A TREMENDOUS HEMOLYSIS. In less than 30 seconds, the hemolyzed hemoglobin will run through the liver, building up a very high bilirubin content in the blood. If that blood then clots, the exudate forms, and all the intact cells with hemoglobin stay behind, only the hemolyzed hemoglobin goes out along with THE SERUM ALBUMIN WHICH BINDS THE BILIRUBIN. So what one ends up with on the cloth is AN EXUDATE WHICH HAS AN ENHANCED BILIRUBIN INDEX with respect to the hemolyzed hemoglobin. You now mix bilirubin which is yellow-orange with methemoglobin in its para-hemic form which is an orangey-brown and YOU GET BLOOD WHICH HAS A RED COLOR.In fact, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIMULATE THIS SPECTRUM IN THE LABORATORY BY THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE. This very strongly suggests that the blood stains are of a man who was severely beaten. No one would have ever dreamed, when we first started doing the analysis, that THE CHEMISTRY WOULD PROVIDE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE to what the pathologists concluded long ago about the Shroud figure. The blood has no cells, is very low in potassium, and HAS THE RIGHT COLOUR AND COMPOSITION FOR THE BLOOD OF A MAN WHO WAS SEVERELY FLOGGED AND CRUCIFIED. This is entirely consistent with the forensic evidence.\"Hopefully \"The Orphaned Manuscript\" will be online in May as part of Barrie Schwortz's next Shroud.com update, if I can finish scanning it by then.

Prof. Bernstein admitted that McCrone was “one of his heroes” having been a revered figure in Chemistry at Cornell University where Bernstein gained his Ph.D. Significantly Bernstein cited McCrone’s establishment of his reputation by his debunking of the Vinland Map, without disclosing to the audience that McCrone was later found to be wrong!  It was clear that Bernstein uncritically accepted everything McCrone wrote on the Shroud as Gospel Truth and he even during the Q&A at the end of the lecture ignorantly claimed of McCrone’s analysis of STURP’s 32 tapes that “no one had ever written a book saying `this guy [McCrone] got it wrong.'” I responded by inviting Prof. Bernstein to read John Heller’s Report on the Shroud of Turin and/or Ian Wilson’s The Blood and the Shroud where McCrone’s claims that the Shroud was a painting and that the blood was just iron oxide and vermilion were comprehensively refuted. But he seemed uninterested.It is ironic that Prof. Bernstein used pro-authenticity Shroud research as a prime example of “pathological science” and McCrone’s anti-authenticity research as “good science,” when the boot is well and truly on the other foot! And Prof. Bernstein himself is hardly engaging in “good science” when he lectures on a subject without bothering to read extensively the other side. But then from my analogous experience in the Creation/Intelligent Design vs Evolution debate, that is the whole point of demonising Shroud pro-authenticity research as “bad” and even “pathological science” or just “faith.” Then, like the proverbial ostrich with its head in the sand, you don’t even have to consider the non-naturalistic other side!I will now write a fuller report on my The Shroud of Turin blog.

I have in the past stated on my blog I am not against further testing of the Shroud and that is still my position.In the context it is only radiocarbon dating that I was referring to. And it isn’t that I am against radiocarbon dating, but that given that: a) there is so much evidence for the Shroud’s authenticity, b) further radiocarbon dating be unlikely to be conclusive; and c) it would have to destroy more and from all areas of the Shroud to be representative. However, if the Vatican allowed a new round of radiocarbon dating, I would not be against it. If such a C-14 test was conducted properly this time I would confidently expect the C-14 date of the Shroud to be a lot closer to the 1st century, but because of centuries of contamination which has become part of the Shroud’s carbon, I would not be surprised if it was 4th century. As for your term “ridiculous computer hacker hypothesis” you are entitled to your opinion.  But as (from memory) you are merely an ex-businessman on social security with no science qualifications, I see no reason why I should be swayed by it. Your running a blog and issuing editorials from `on high’ blasting the views if those you disagree with (like me) as “ridiculous,” while it may `poison the well’ against me in the minds of some of your readers, does not make you right. I have stated the evidence for my `the laboratories were duped by a computer hacker’ theory:1. As Clifford Stoll revealed in his 1989 book, “The Cockoo’s Egg”, in the 1980s university computers were all interconnected; and they were poorly secured. I mentioned in passing that not long after that era, in the early 1990s, I was a UNIX Systems Administrator of a widely distributed hospital computer network, I have some expertise in that area. 2. In the very era the Shroud was being C-14 dated, 1980s, there were numerous successful unauthorised hacks of university and even military computers. The hacker, Markus Hess, who hacked into Stoll’s Berkeley University computer network, was dialing in from Germany and hacked into 400 different university and military computers. 3. The very first AMS date of the Shroud at Arizona University’s C-14 lab was the `bull’s eye’ date AD1350. 4. Gove and those present, including those who thought the Shroud was authentic uncritically accepted that date as the date the Shroud’s flax was harvested. Even though before the test Gove thought the Shroud would date from 1000 +/- 100 years. 5. So if a hacker by that `perfect date’ was using shrewd psychology to overcome resistance, it worked! 6. But for that AD 1350 date to be true: a) the flax would have to have been harvested only 5 years before the Shroud was displayed at Lirey, France, in 1355; and 2) Arizona laboratory’s pre-treatment would have had to be perfect-removing all traces of non-original carbon.7. Agnostic Thomas de Wesselow considers fraud to be a real possibility in the 1988 C-14 dating of the Shroud, because the 1325 +/- 65 years C-14 date of the Shroud is just what a fraudster who wished to discredit the Shroud would use. 8. Ian Wilson, who knew many of the labs’ leadership, believes they were basically honest. But fraud did not have to be by the laboratories. Computer hacking is a type of fraud which could have duped  the laboratories because most of those dating the Shroud thought the Shroud was a fake.My theory that a hacker accessed the online control console computer at the three C-14 labs and overrode the Shroud’s dates coming from their same AMS dating systems, and replaced them with 14th century dates, which together produced a date of the Shroud, the midpoint of which is only 25-30 years before the Shroud appeared at Lirey in the 1350s, fits all the above facts. It is not impossible, given the interconnected and insecure university computers of the 1980s, and given the inexplicability of the 1988 AD 1260-1390 C-14 dating of the Shroud, it is a real possibility, if not a probability, Stephen E.

Ian Wilson and Mark Guscin are two Shroud pro-authenticist authors who consider, and refute, the general Shroud sceptic argument that a 13th-14th century forger went around museums and art galleries (as French biologist/artist Paul Vignon did in the early 20th century), noting marks-in-common on Byzantine artworks dating back to the 6th century (the \"Vignon markings\"), and included those in his Shroud forgery.

Someone claimed that, because it can't be disputed that the shroud has not left Europe since the time that the carbon dating results place it's creation at, the fact that pollen from Jerusalem can be found on it shows the shroud must have existed outside of Europe at an earlier date.

But Geoffroy I de Charny (c.1300-56), the first undisputed owner of the Shroud, was POOR. He had to request funding from the King of France to build his modest wooden church at Lirey.9) And having made ONE Shroud, the forger would have made MORE, since the public and clergy did not care that other churches had their own `original' of the same relic.

That is 65 years before the earliest 1260 radiocarbon date of the Shroud. And the drawings within the Codex, which depict the \"poker holes\" (and 7 other unique features on the Shroud, according to agnostic art historian Thomas de Wesselow), must be even older than that. Therefore the Pray Codex drawings alone refute the 1260-1390 radiocarbon date of the Shroud.13) The Pray Codex was discovered in 1770 by György Pray, presumably in the archives of the University of Nagy-Szombat in Slovakia where Pray was then a professor of theology. The codex and its drawings had presumably been there unrecognised since 1285 when the Boldva monastery was destroyed by the Mongols and the monks fled. The unknown, hypothetical, medieval forger of the Shroud, in addition to his other `superhuman' museum and art gallery (which didn't then exist) travels, would have had to travel to Hungary or Slovakia, discover the Codex written in Old Hungarian, and the drawings inside it, copy 8 features on those drawings including the \"poker holes,\" and incorporate them also into his hypothetical Shroud forgery.Shroud sceptics can respond with the glib answer that the forger incorporated the Vignon markings and Pray Codex features in his forgery, but no Shroud sceptic has actually proposed a COMPREHENSIVE forgery theory which plausibly explains in detail HOW and WHEN the forger did it (let alone WHY), museum by museum, art gallery by art gallery, marking by marking. If a Shroud sceptic had attempted to develop such a comprehensive forgery theory, he must have quietly given up, when he realised its IMPLAUSIBILITY (if not IMPOSSIBILITY).  >Many thanks in advance for anything you can tell me,[...] I hope this has helped you to realise that you were indeed right the first time!Stephen E.

So no medieval European forger would have dared to depict Christ naked[59] realistically, as the man on the Shroud is[60] . Therefore the complete nudity of the image on the Shroud is a further proof of its authenticity[61]!\"Note: \"So no medieval European forger would have dared to depict Christ naked.\"But because the Shroud was believed and claimed by its medieval owners who exhibited it, to be NOT the work of an artist/forger, but the imprint of Jesus' body on His burial shroud, it was NOT \"sacrilegious and blasphemous to the medieval mind.\" Only IF the Shroud was the work of an artist/forger would the Shroud man's total nudity be \"sacrilegious and blasphemous to the medieval mind.\" Which is further evidence against the 1389 claim of the Bishop of Troyes, Pierre d'Arcis (†1377-1395) that the image on the Shroud had been \"cunningly painted\" and one of his predecessors, Bishop Henry de Poitiers (†1354-1370), had \"discovered ... the artist who had painted it.\" (Wilson, I., 1979, \"The Shroud of Turin,\" pp.266-267).If the artist who had painted the Shroud's image of a completely naked Jesus, showing His buttocks, and scourge marks around His genitals, had been discovered by Bishop de Poitiers, the forger would have been arrested, charged, tried, found guilty of blasphemy, and burned at the stake. There then would have been a record of his arrest, trial and execution, and the forger name would have been cited by Bishop d'Arcis, who was a lawyer. That d'Arcis cited no name of the forger, or details of his trial and execution, shows there never was a forger, and d'Arcis was at best misinformed, and at worst lying.Stephen E.

I hope that as time progresses these proofs shall become even more solid even as the hearts of the world become harder for the Spirit to penetrate. With the discovery of the Pray Manuscript (1192-1195) with its unique features of the Shroud, predating the earliest possible 1988 radiocarbon dating of 1260-1390 by at least 65 years; and the perfect match of the Sudarium of Oviedo with the face of the Man on the Shroud; the proof that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Jesus (and the Sudarium of Oviedo is the headcloth in Jn 20:5-7); already is solid enough. But there are still more proofs accumulating for the Shroud's authenticity, e.g. as briefly mentioned in my post above, Markwardt's evidence in his paper, \"Ancient Edessa and the Shroud: History Concealed by the Discipline of the Secret\" that the Shroud was known in the second century AD, but was concealed by allegorical language. >As a side note, I have also found your 2037 interpretation to be quite an interesting conclusion, and am continuing to reflect and read up on your line of reasoning.

This was such a good collection of articles and thoughts.Thanks for your comment and for the link on your blog, Path of the Weis.>I love how this one takes a nice swing at the silly claim of the JW claim. One wonders what in the world they are thinking sometimes.They don't think for themselves. The Watchtower Society warns JWs to \"Avoid Independent Thinking\" (my emphasis bold):\"Avoid Independent Thinking From the very outset of his rebellion Satan called into question God's way of doing things. He promoted independent thinking. `You can decide for yourself what is good and bad,' Satan told Eve. `You don't have to listen to God. He is not really telling you the truth.' (Genesis 3:1-5) To this day, it has been Satan's subtle design to infect God's people with this type of thinking.-2 Timothy 3:1, 13. How is such independent thinking manifested? A common way is by questioning the counsel that is provided by God's visible organization. ....\" (\"Exposing the Devil's Subtle Designs,\" The Watchtower, January 15, 1983, pp.18-22, p.22)and even to \"Fight Against Independent Thinking\":\"Fight Against Independent Thinking As we study the Bible we learn that Jehovah has always guided his servants in an organized way. And just as in the first century there was only one true Christian organization, so today Jehovah is using only one organization. (Ephesians 4:4, 5; Matthew 24:45-47) Yet there are some who point out that the organization has had to make adjustments before, and so they argue: `This shows that we have to make up our own mind on what to believe.' This is independent thinking. Why is it so dangerous? Such thinking is an evidence of pride. ... If we get to thinking that we know better than the organization, we should ask ourselves: `Where did we learn Bible truth in the first place? Would we know the way of the truth if it had not been for guidance from the organization? Really, can we get along without the direction of God's organization?' No, we cannot! ... When we consider the mighty spirit forces who are fighting against us, we must acknowledge that on our own we could not possibly win. Yet with God's backing, and with the help and support of his organization-our worldwide association of brothers-we cannot lose. ...\" (\"Armed for the Fight Against Wicked Spirits,\" The Watchtower, January 15, 1983, pp.23-27, p.27)  which means unthinking and unquestioning obedience to the Watchtower organization, which is really the JW's god.>Along with the Mormon claim, this is such a house of cards that any study, be it Theological, historical and in this case scientific will blow a mighty wind a knock the house over.The problem is that for JWs and the Mormons their ultimate ground of belief is not in the Bible, nor in any objective evidence, but it is in their respective cultic organizations, the Watchtower Society and the LDS Church.But that is why a JW's faith might be shaken more by evidence that the Watchtower Society has been wrong for nearly 60 years in that Jesus really did die on a two-beamed cross and not a single upright stake, than by arguing about the meaning of Bible verses (which however does have its place).>Thank you for continuing to update us on what you find about the Shroud. I like you am thoroughly convinced of it's authenticity. What more does a person really want to convince them? My faith doesn't rest on it, but it certainly backs up my faith.Agreed. For us Christians, the Shroud is just another example of the truth of Ephesians 3:20 \"Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine ...\"However, as the public become more and more aware that the 1988 radiocarbon-dating of the Shroud to the 14th century was wrong (if not fraudulent) and the now overwhelming evidence that the Shroud is the very burial sheet of Jesus, inscribed with a record of His horrific suffering and death on a cross for them and also with His resurrection, maybe millions who otherwise wouldn't will become Christians in one last mighty harvest, in these last years before Jesus returns (in my considered opinion before 2037).>Blessings to you in the name of Christ,Thanks.

The gospels clearly say that Jesus was wrapped in 'strips' of cloth, except for a a type of hood over his head.No. As leading evangelical Christian theologian Dr. Gary Habermas (and others) has demonstrated in his two co-authored books, \"Verdict on the Shroud\" (1981) and \"The Shroud and the Controversy\" (1990), the Shroud is perfectly in harmony with the Gospel accounts of Jesus burial (as well as His suffering, death and resurrection), when the data in all four Gospels is carefully considered, especially in the original Greek.The \"strips of linen\" in Lk 24:12; Jn 11:44; 19:40; 20:5-6 is a mistranslation by the NIV in being too specific when the underlying Greek words can just mean linen cloths. The KJV more correctly translates those same verses by the more general \"linen clothes\" and \"graveclothes.\" The NASB translates those verses as \"linen wrappings.\" The NLT of those same verses has \"linen wrappings\" and \"graveclothes\" and \"long sheets of linen cloth.\"Also the NIV is at variance with Jewish burial customs, where bodies were enfolded in a shroud not wound around in strips or bandages like an Egyptian mummy. The only strips that were used in Jewish burials are those tying the hands, feet and jaw, to keep them in place before rigor mortis set in. That is probably what is meant in Jn 11:44 where Lazarus was still bound by those linen strips, but it does not mean (or say) that he was otherwise naked, which he would be if those strips were all that he was wearing.See my 2007 post \"Bogus: Shroud of Turin? #1\" and Does the Shroud Contradict the Gospels?.Stephen E.

I wish they could explain thelack of distance between the front of the image and the back. Thanks for your comment. I am away from my home while it is being painted and so I don't have access to my Shroud books. So this is an answer off the top of my head (no pun intended!).My first point is that claims of apparent gross anatomical blunders in the Shroud's image (and in this case there may not even be that-see below) argues more in favour of the Shroud's authenticity than the alternative forgery theory.That is because: 1) other anatomical features of the Shroud (e.g. the wounds, blood-flows, etc) exhibit an accuracy (if not a  perfection) that would require an an artistic genius of at least the level a Leonardo da Vinci. But then an artistic genius of at least that level would hardly commit gross anatomical blunders that even an average art student would not make.2) If there were such apparent major anomalies, that would be evidence that the Shroud's image was formed not by human or normal natural processes, but by some extraordinary or supernatural process, e.g. the image actually is a type of xray originating from within the body (see my CED blog post of 14 May 2007), where distances are less than at the surface, and not from its surface where distances are greater; and/or the image was formed as the linen collapsed downward as Jesus' body was resurrected through it, as proposed by physicist John P. Jackson. >I placeda blanket on my head there was an 8-inch gap of where my face wouldhave touched the front and where my head would have touched the back.According to this anti-authenticity article, an \"8-inch gap\" is is fact what exists between the Shroud's front and back head images: \"The front and back images of the head are separated by a gap of perhaps 20 cm (8 inches)\"!But as I said, I don't have my books with me, but when I get home I will refer to my large photos of the Shroud and measure the gap and report the result in a further comment.>Looking at the PHOTOs there is less than 2 inches. This is alsodepicted in most of the artwork that I've seen. See above.>I do not doubt thatthere was one at some time in the past.

I believe since 631 AD. This is fact.Agreed about \"the 7th century\" but not necessarily \"631 AD\". The Sudarium probably entered Spain on or shortly after AD616 but did not arrive in Oviedo until 718 (see below).The AD631 date is when St. Braulio, bishop of Saragossa, Spain, wrote in a letter that \"the linteaminibus [linen] and the sudarium in which the Lord's body was wrapped\" had been in Jerusalem but he did not know of their present whereabouts (Guscin, M., \"The Oviedo Cloth,\" 1998, pp.11-12). He was either genuinely ignorant of the location of the Sudarium being in Spain, or did not want to reveal it.Guscin says that, according to the chronicle of Pelayo, bishop of Oviedo (1101-43), the Sudarium was taken from Jerusalem before it was sacked by the Persians in 614 and arrived in Spain after the fall of Alexandria in 616 and before the death in 633 of St. Fulgentius, bishop of Ecija, Spain, who received  Sudarium in a chest (Guscin, p.14).The chest containing the Sudarium passed to St. Isidore, bishop of Seville (c.560-636), who in turn passed it on to his student San Ildefonso (St Ildephonsus), who became bishop of Toledo in 657 and died in 667.Then following the Muslim invasion of Spain in 711, the Sudarium was taken in 718 in its chest to a cave near Oviedo (which was not founded until 761). The sudarium remained in the cave until King Alfonso II (791-842) built the Camara Santa for it in the Oviedo cathedral in 840 (Guscin, p.15). The chest was eventually opened in 1075, by King Alfonso IV and the Sudarium was in it (Guscin, p.17). So the historical evidence is that the Sudarium has been in Spain since at least 633 (and probably 616-620), and before that it was in Jerusalem, presumably from the time of Jesus' crucifixion (because why would anyone keep a small, plain, blood-stained cloth in Jerusalem if it was not Jesus'?).>When the Sudarium and The Shroud of Turin face are aligned, the blood spots exactly line up. Agreed. This is the strongest evidence (which in a criminal trial would be accepted as proof beyond reasonable doubt) that the Sudarium of Oviedo and the Shroud of Turin covered the same face.And since the Sudarium has been in Spain since 616-633 and in Jerusalem before that, the simplest hypothesis is the Shroud of Turin must also have been in Jerusalem and also covered the body of Jesus.>The Sudarium and the Shroud of Turin both have the rare blood type AB.Apparently old blood tends to degrade to type AB, so this is not conclusive evidence that the blood of the Sudarium's and Shroud were from the same victim. But if the blood type had been different, then that would have been strong evidence against the Sudarium and the Shroud having covered the same body. So the fact that the Sudarium has the same type AB blood as the Shroud is an important test of authenticity that the Sudarium could have failed but successfully passed.>This alone should be cause for alarm, with respect to the C14 dating of the shroud. The C14 should have, at least, dated the shroud to the 7th century.Agreed. Before the Sudarium of Oviedo evidence, the evidence that the Shroud of Turin is the burial sheet of Christ was already very strong (e.g. the Shroud's unique marks found on art going back to the 6th century), and the only positive evidence against it was the 14th century C14 dating.Because of the many problems with C14 dating, due to contamination with external carbon, etc, archaeologists normally disregard a C14 date as anomalous if it disagrees with other known facts about an artifact. So the only reason the C14 dating has not been set aside in the case of the Shroud is because of the enormous loss of face science would have to endure, especially in respect of Christianity. This is exacerbated by the fact that most scientists are agnostics/atheists and if the Shroud of Turin really is the burial sheet of Christ, then that is personally very hard for them to accept.Stephen E.

A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question which contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt). Aside from being an informal fallacy depending on usage, such questions may be used as a rhetorical tool: the question attempts to limit direct replies to be those that serve the questioner's agenda. The traditional example is the question `Have you stopped beating your wife?' Whether the respondent answers yes or no, they will admit to having a wife and having beaten her at some time in the past. Thus, these facts are presupposed by the question, and in this case an entrapment, because it narrows the respondent to a single answer, and the fallacy of many questions has been committed.\" (\"Loaded question,\" Wikipedia, 15 June 2015).I DID answer your question by pointing out that: \"It is not a question of knowing. I have always said that the Vatican, by its actions, shows that it believes the Shroud to be authentic.\"But you wanted to entrap me by requiring of me a simple `yes' or `no' answer to your fallacious question. If I had answered \"yes, I do know more than the Vatican,\" you would rightly accuse me of arrogance. But if I had answered, \"no, I don't know more than the Vatican,\" you would rightly accuse me of ignorance. So I could not win if I had accepted the `have you stopped beating your wife?' terms of your question. So I did not accept the fallacious terms of your question but answered truthfully what the real issue is: the Vatican knows the Shroud is authentic, but refuses to confirm or deny it. Presumably because (as I have written before) if the Vatican had to start confirming or denying which of its many claimed relics were authentic, it would have to admit that almost all of them were fakes.You have had more than your normal \"only one comment per individual under each one of my posts\" (see my policies above) so this was your last comment under this post.Stephen E.

I found the following post by \"Hugh Farey\" over at Dan's blog regarding this blog entry and thought you might like to address it: ...No. As I stated as recently as 20 August 2015, posting comments on my blog for the purpose of providing discussion on Porter's blog is off-topic:==================================You may not be aware that since November 4, 2014 it has been my policy that:\"... mentioning of Dan Porter, and his blog, and his blog's members in connection with Porter's blog, is henceforth off-topic on my blog.\"I further advised of this policy in my comments of: November 14, 2014; November 16, 2014; and May 31, 2015My reason is given in my November 16 comment that I don't want to provide `grist for the mill' of Porter's blog:----------------------------------\"As I have stated ... it is my policy ... that: `... mentioning of Dan Porter, and his blog, and his blog's members in connection with Porter's blog, is henceforth off-topic on my blog.' ... This includes you [Porter] , or your members, making comments on my blog for the purpose of providing `grist for the mill' of your blog.----------------------------------Which in turn is based on my objection stated in my post, of May 8, 2014: \"`The Letter from Alexius Comnenus': My response to Dan Porter,\" that \"Porter is a pirate who steals the hard work and intellectual property of others\" including me:----------------------------------\"Again Porter has scavenged my work, rather than do original work of his own. As I have said before, ... Porter is a pirate who steals the hard work and intellectual property of others ... But Porter is evidently untroubled by the ethics of parasiting off the work of others, despite it being against their expressed wishes, to feed his `gossip column' blog.\"----------------------------------My policy above is aimed at preventing Porter and his readers from starting a comments debate on my blog and then cross-posting it to Porter's blog, to provide `grist for its mill'.==================================Except to say that Farey, a mere science teacher, contradicts ancient textiles conservator Mechthilde Flury-Lemberg's statement that the stitching of the seam joining the sidestrip and the main body of the Shroud is closely similar, if not identical, to that found at Masada. As Farey himself stated according to you: \"As it happens, I don't agree with some of Flury Lemberg's interpretations.\" So if anyone choose to believe Farey over against Flury-Lemberg that's THEIR problem.Here are the sources I based the Masada part of my \"Sidestrip\" entry above on. First was Ian Wilson's eye-witness report of what Flury-Lemberg said at the 2000 Turin Symposium (my emphases):\"The first speaker was Dr. Mechthild Flury-Lemberg ... But even more importantly, Dr. Flury-Lemberg found the cloth's finishing, at its hems, and in the joining seam to have been done using an unusual type of stitching very nearly invisible on one side, and as such CLOSELY RESEMBLING THAT OF ANCIENT JEWISH TEXTILES AS FOUND AT MASADA, THE JEWISH PALACE-FORTRESS THAT WAS OVERTHROWN BY THE ROMANS IN AD 73, NEVER TO BE OCCUPIED AGAIN. This alone, therefore, constitutes powerful evidence against the carbon dating result of 1988. As Dr. Flury-Lemberg told the Sunday Times 'In my opinion the Shroud is not a mediaeval fake. The parallels I have found indicate that it could have existed at the same time as Jesus Christ and in what is now Israel.'\" (Wilson, I., 2000, \"`The Turin Shroud – past, present and future', Turin, 2-5 March, 2000 – probably the best-ever Shroud Symposium,\" BSTS Newsletter, No. 51, June).

To be honest I don't know. But if I had to pick the most promising method, I would say it could have been constructed using a rubbing technique on a bas-relief model.\"But the \"bas-relief model,\" far from being \"promising\" is just another one of the many failed naturalistic alternatives of how the Shroud's image was formed. Indeed, that the \"bas-relief model\" is just one of many so-called \"promising\" naturalistic methods of forming the Shroud's image, is itself evidence that other Shroud anti-authenticity advocates regard it as inadequate. Also the \"bas-relief model\" conflicts with the website's own citing of \"a Catholic bishop's [d'Arcis] report to Pope Clement VII, dated 1389, stating that ... a predecessor had `discovered the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it'\". The website cannot have it both ways. If the Shroud was \"painted\" then it should be advocating the \"painting model\" not the  \"bas-relief model.\" But if the Shroud was not \"painted\" (which it wasn't) then this bishop's report was wrong (which it is)!Stephen E.

However, there were a lot of problems with the latter, including the possibility (if not probability) of outright fraud. See \"The Great Holy Shroud Dating Fraud of 1988.\" I certainly don't agree with everything in this paper, but there seems to be at least a prima facie case that the Shroud linen sample may have been switched for a sample from a medieval cloth.If my proposal to radiocarbon date the Shroud's pollen (as set out in my paper \"A proposal to radiocarbon-date the pollen of the Shroud of Turin,\" to be published in December's British Society for the Turin Shroud's Newsletter), if carried out, will provide an independent check, using the same method, on the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud's linen.>It is my understanding from various passages in The Bible that the shroud is unlikely to be the burial shroud of Jesus, especially in looking at Jhn 20:7.>>\"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.\"Again, the short answer is that there is no real conflict between the Shroud and the Bible. In my book, \"The Shroud of Turin: Burial Sheet of Jesus?,\" I will have a chapter, \"3. THE BIBLE AND THE SHROUD,\" where I will fully cover this issue.The basic problem is that the various gospel writers, writing from their own perspective, use different Greek words for the various graveclothes, singly and collectively (i.e. sindon = linen sheet, shroud; othonia = linen strips, linen collectively, sudarion = head cloth, jaw-band; and keiriai = bandages, windings); and the problem is compounded by our English translations of those Greek words, and our preexisting ideas that the Jews wrapped their bodies like Egyptian mummies, when they did not.Here are some quotes which explain and answer these problems:\"Although the New Testament's description of typical first-century Jewish burial customs is not overly detailed, it does give the general features. The body was washed (Acts 9:37) and the hands and feet were bound (John 11:44). A cloth handkerchief (Greek, sudarion) was placed `around' the face (John 11:44; 20:7). The body was then wrapped in clean linen, often mixed with spices (John 19:39-40), and laid in the tomb or grave. The Code of Jewish Law adds that the Jews usually shaved the head and beard completely and cut the fingernails before burial. However, the gospels tell us that Jesus' burial was incomplete. Because the Sabbath was about to begin, he was removed from the cross and laid in the tomb rather hurriedly. This is why the women returned to the tomb on Sunday morning. They had prepared spices and ointments for Jesus' body, and they went to the tomb to apply them (Luke 23:54-56). It is not often noticed why the women went to the tomb. They certainly did not expect Jesus to rise (Luke 24:3-4; John 20:12-15). Rather they came in order to finish anointing Jesus' body with the prepared spices (Luke 24:1; Mark 16:1). They were worried about who would help them to move the stone from the entrance of the tomb so that they could finish the job begun before the Sabbath (Mark 16:3).\" (Stevenson, K.E. & Habermas, G.R., \"Verdict on the Shroud,\" Servant Books: Ann Arbor MI, 1981, pp.46-47).\"Another apparent problem crops up in the descriptions of the grave clothes the disciples saw in the tomb on Easter morning. Both Luke and John describe grave clothes in the tomb. Luke says that Peter went inside the tomb and saw the othonia-the generic term for all the grave clothes, including the shroud and the smaller pieces used to bind the jaw, hands, and feet. John, however, gives a more detailed description of what he and Peter saw, and he introduces another term into the grave clothes listing. When they went into the tomb, they saw the othonia lying on the ground, but also the sudarion lying rolled up in a place by itself, apart from these othonia. John adds the detail that the sudarion had been \"around the head\" of Jesus. Sudarion means `napkin' or `sweat cloth.' It is, at any rate, a rather small piece of cloth. If it had been placed over the face of Jesus in the tomb, no image of Jesus' face would have appeared on the Shroud. Since the Shroud of Turin bears the image of a face, the reference to a sudarion seems to challenge the authenticity of the Shroud. Indeed, some Christians have pointed to this passage as evidence that the Shroud is incompatible with scripture. However, a number of scripture scholars do not think that the sudarion was a napkin or cloth placed over Jesus' face. The Mishnah instructs Jews to tie up the chin of the corpse (Shabbath 23;5). The Code of Jewish Law also commands the practice of binding the chin. 8 Lazarus' napkin was wrapped \"around\" his face (Greek, perideo), a position that is more consistent with the jaw being tied shut. Additionally, John's observation that Jesus' napkin was found \"rolled up\" (Greek, entulisso) in the empty tomb corresponds closely to the cloth being used to bind the jaw. John A.T. Robinson, the British New Testament scholar, gives the most plausible explanation for the sudarion. He says it was probably a jaw band, a piece of linen rolled up into a strip, placed under the chin, drawn up around the face, and tied on the top of the head. Its function was to keep the jaw shut before rigor mortis set in. Not only does the New Testament not state that the napkin was placed over the face so as to cover it, but the combination of `wrapped up' and `around the head' (John 20:7; cf. 11:44) fits what is depicted in the Shroud. Jaw bands are used for this purpose today and there is every reason to believe that they were used in first-century Palestine. There is evidence for just such a jaw band on the three-dimensional image of the face of the Shroud. The hair of the man seems to be separated from the cheeks. The hair or the left side of the face hangs out over the edge of an object probably the chin band.\" (Stevenson & Habermas, 1981, pp.49-50). \"As we have already mentioned, it was normal for Jews to be buried in clothing, more specifically the white garments they wore for festivals. In the case of Jesus we would not necessarily expect this, as we know his clothing was taken from him at the time of crucifixion. But many authors have pointed out. that we would certainly not expect the fourteen-foot sheet that we find preserved in Turin. Here again we are in a hornets' nest of controversy over gospel interpretation that exists quite independently of the Shroud. It all stems from apparent conflicts of information between the synoptic writers and St. John. The synoptics speak only of the sindon purchased by Joseph of Arimathea (Mt. 7:59; Mk. 15:46; Lk. 23:53). This is often translated as shroud, although it should be pointed out that it does not have a specifically sepulchral meaning. St. Mark, for instance, used the same word to describe the garment lost by the young man at Gethsemane who fled at the arrest of Jesus (Mk. 14:51, 52). St. John, on the other hand, does not use the word sindon, but instead says the body of Jesus was wrapped in othonia. And in his account of the discovery of the linens in the empty tomb again he uses the word othonia (which he describes as lying at the scene), and refers also cryptically to a mysterious soudarion, rolled up and lying in a place by itself (Jn. 20:7) . The precise meanings of othonia and sindon in their gospel context have been hotly debated. Some have contended that othonia (which is a plural form) means linen bands and that Joseph must have torn up the sindon into strips to wind Jesus mummy-style. Quite neutral exegetes such as Pere Benoit have pointed out that it would surely have been easier for Joseph to purchase ready-made bandages rather than tearing up a large sheet for this purpose. The most balanced modern view is that othonia means cloths in general, which could incorporate shroud and bands.\" (Wilson, I., \"The Turin Shroud,\" Book Club Associates: London, 1978, pp.41-42). \"What of the soudarion, literally a `sweat cloth'? Some have thought of this as simply the headcloth or chin band-which is clearly what the soudarion mentioned in the story of Lazarus as `round his face' (Jn. 11:44) was. Others have argued that it may have been our Shroud, on the grounds that the description of it as having been `over his head' (Jn. 20:7) could well refer to the manner in which we know the Turin Shroud was used. In support of this argument we may note that in the Lazarus account St. John uses the word peri ('round' or `about'), in contrast to epi ('over'), in the case of Jesus, leaving open the possibility that a different arrangement (and different size of cloth) is being described. St. John makes special mention of Jesus' soudarion being `not with the othonia but rolled up in a place by itself,' which certainly might suggest a cloth larger and more important than a mere chin hand; but as many maintain adamantly that a soudarion could not be anything larger than a handkerchief-sized piece of cloth, it seems unwise to be dogmatic. The conclusion to be drawn is that from exegetical studies alone we can be sure of nothing, that of themselves they can neither prove nor disprove that the Shroud is genuine. It does seem worthwhile at least to consider the various possibilities raised by the gospel accounts for what the Shroud might have been among the linens Peter and John found in the empty tomb on the first Easter Sunday.\" (Wilson, 1978, pp.42-43). \"The precise nature of the burial cloths has been the subject of much debate. The synoptists tell us that Joseph of Arimathea bought (Mark) a clean (Matthew) linen shroud or sheet (Greek - sindon) and wrapped Jesus in it (Matthew, Mark, Luke) [Mt 27:59; Mk 15:46; Lk 23:50-56]. John mentions no shroud, but speaks in the plural of linen cloths (othonia) [Jn 19:40; 20:5-6] and also of a soudarion - \"the napkin, which had been on his head ... rolled up in a place by itself.\" [Jn 20:7] The disputed (but probably authentic) passage at Luke 24:12 makes no further reference to the sheet, but mentions othonia lying by themselves. Christian artists have commonly depicted the grave-clothes of Jesus as broad bandages wound round the limbs and the body, together with a turban-like towel around his head. Some writers have visualised the linen sheet being torn into strips and the spices being wound into the folds. It has then been supposed that at the resurrection thesoudarion and othonia collapsed in situ to form two separate piles. As will be seen presently this does not in fact tally very well with what the evangelists say, but it illustrates the apparently rather imprecise and confusing picture which they seem to give. John gives us an account of a normal burial in a well-to-do home in his record of the raising of Lazarus: \"The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages (keiriai), and his face wrapped with a cloth (soudarion). Jesus said to them, `Unbind him, and let him go.'' [Jn 11:44] There is nothing in this account to suggest a winding of long bandages around arms and legs and other parts of the body; indeed just the opposite, for the resuscitated corpse was certainly not deprived of wrappings which left him standing there naked. Before burial he had been washed, anointed with perfumed ointments and dressed in his best clean garment. Short strips of cloth had apparently been tied round wrists and ankles to keep his arms and legs in position, and the soudarion kept the mouth from falling open. The hobbled Lazarus was able to shuffle to the entrance of the tomb, where he was set free by the untying of these three cloths. And now he stood there fully clothed.\" (Wenham, J.W., \"Easter Enigma: Are the Resurrection Stories in Conflict?,\" [1984], Paternoster: Exeter UK, Reprinted, 1987, pp.66-67).\"Q. Doesn't the Shroud conflict with Scripture? a) John 20:5-7 mentions linens and at the very least implies there were a minimum of two cloths. Many have suggested that the linens were `strips,' however the Shroud is merely one piece of cloth. ... A. …. The answers to these apparent discrepancies are as follows: First, the Gospels use the following words to describe the Shroud: Sindon burial sheet, winding sheet, shroud; sudarion-sweat cloth, face cloth, handkerchief; othonia linens. One way for the synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) to be in harmony with John is if a burial method like the one depicted on the Shroud was used. John mentions a cloth that was described as `around his head' and about the face of Lazarus (John 20:7; 11:44). The word is sudarion, used in burial to bind the jaw against the effects of rigor mortis. There is evidence on the Shroud that a sudarion was used, though the whereabouts of any such cloth has long been unknown. The Shroud is a pure linen garment with some evidence that the head, hands, and feet were bound, most likely with other `linens.' The synoptics describe a linen sheet-a single cloth. Most likely, the sheet was more significant to the synoptic writers than other funerary cloths. Since the Jewish burial custom allowed the use of cloths to bind the hands and feet as well as the jaw, the total picture matches Jewish burial customs exactly and explains clearly why the synoptics only mention a sindon and John mentions othonia. Second, John's use of othonia has led to a widely held belief that Jesus was wrapped like an Egyptian mummy. But such a procedure doesn't conform to what is known of first-century normal Jewish burial ritual. Nor does it match what was previously mentioned in the Word, to wit, that Joseph of Arimathea had purchased a winding sheet and wrapped Jesus in it (Mark 15:46). Even John used the word edesan, which is translated wound in the KJV but literally means `enfolded.' Enfolded would also match the burial custom. Being wrapped with strips of cloth would not. In other words, othonia in John should be understood to mean that Jesus' dead body was enveloped from head to feet in one burial cloth, not wrapped like a mummy with numerous strips of cloth.\" (Stevenson, K.E. & Habermas, G.R., \"The Shroud and the Controversy,\" Thomas Nelson: Nashville TN, 1990, p.149-150. Emphasis original).\"In addition to the Frei sticky tapes taken from the Shroud in 1973 (Table 1) and 1978 for pollen grains, other related materials were also examined. This included three samples from the Sudarium of Oviedo, the traditional face cloth (John 20:7), which would have been wrapped around the head to cover the disfigured face until enshroudment. The Sudarium, which has only bloodstains and no image, has been housed in Oviedo, Spain, continuously since the mid-8th century (Guscin, 1998). In 1979, Frei took 46 sticky tape samples from the Sudarium. All except three of these were removed from his collection shortly after his death and were not available for examination.\" (Danin, A., Whanger, A.D., Baruch, U. & Whanger, M., \"Flora of the Shroud of Turin,\" Missouri Botanical Garden Press: St. Louis MO, 1999, p.11)See the video \"Shroud Report Interview with Mark Guscin\" for a demonstration of how the Sudarium of Oviedo (the sudarion of John 20:7) complements the Shroud of Turin.>There are other issues as well that would lead me to believe that this is not the burial shroud of Jesus.OK.>I confess that I am neither a theologian nor an expert and it is clear that you have done much research into this area - but I see some things that appear to be contrary to the belief that the shroud is in fact His.See above.>Thanks!Hope this has helped.Stephen E.

From admittedly what little I have read about the  Tilma of Juan Diego, aka. the Image of Guadelupe, there is no comparison between it and the Shroud of Turin.Scientific testing of the Shroud of Turin has shown it not to be a painting, with no paint or pigment, but scientific testing has shown the Image of Guadelupe to be a painting, with layers of paint:\"In 2002, art restoration expert José Sol Rosales said he examined the icon with a stereomicroscope and that he identified calcium sulfate, pine soot, white, blue, and green \"tierras\" (soil), reds made from carmine and other pigments, as well as gold. Rosales said he found the work consistent with 16th century materials and methods ... Norberto Rivera Carrera, Archbishop of Mexico, commissioned a 1999 study to test the tilma's age. Leoncio Garza-Valdés, a pediatrician and microbiologist who had previously worked with the Shroud of Turin, claimed, upon inspection of photographs of the image, to have found three distinct layers in the painting, at least one of which had initials painted on it.\" (\"Our Lady of Guadalupe,\" Wikipedia).Garza-Valdés, whom I know of from my Shroud of Turin studies, is a devout Roman Catholic, who regards the Shroud of Turin as authentic, so if he says the Image of Guadalupe is a painting, that is decisive for me.>Considering that the tilma still exist to this day and did not rot, it could be said that it is alive.I gather the Image of Guadelupe is on hemp, which is very durable. >When alive, plants absorbed radio carbon and stop only when it died whence radio carbon decay. This is the basic principle of carbon dating. Agreed.>Now if the shroud is alive up to the date when it was first exposed to public then it was only at that date where the linen (derived from plant) has its radio carbon start to decay. The Shroud itself is linen, which is woven flax and ceases to be alive when the flax dies, i.e. is harvested.>Consequently, the carbon dating will point to the said date, which was the one observed in the radio carbon dating experiment. This can support the belief that the shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of JesusIt wouldn't. That the flax the linen of the Shroud is made of was alive just before the Shroud's first undisputed appearance in France c. 1350, is in fact what the 1988 radiocarbon date of 1260-1390 assumed is the case.Proponents of the authenticity of the Shroud claim the flax was alive only up to or before the early 1st century AD, and that the radiocarbon date is wrong, i.e. it does not yield a true chronological age, due to one or more factors, such as contamination with younger carbon, and/or enrichment of neutrons (i.e. from Jesus' resurrecting body changing its state of matter), that are known to give an apparently younger radiocarbon age than the actual chronological age.Stephen E.

The only reason I came to accept the authenticity of the Shroud is that in 2005, after nearly 40 years a Christian, and to the extent I thought about the Shroud at all, I assumed it was just another fake medieval relic, I became aware of the evidence for its authenticity in Stevenson & Habermas’ book, Verdict on the Shroud (1981), that I bought for $3.00 in a second-hand bookstore. I only bought the book because: 1) it was co-authored by evangelical theologian Gary Habermas whose writings I was familiar with as sound and evidence-based; and 2) it cost only $3.00.I note that Anderson has a PhD Philosophy of Evolutionary Biology. He should then appreciate that if the Shroud is a fake, yet God has allowed it to come into existence, complete with all the evidence for its authenticity, then God would be a “cosmic deceiver.” And then Anderson could not logically reject the extreme Young-Earth Creationist “Appearance of Age” argument that God allowed the Universe to come into existence, complete with a fake history of it being billions of years old, when in reality it is only tens of thousands of years old.","date":"January 22, 2012 at 10:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/22/correcting-an-article-about-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Correcting an article about the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">Professor Paolo Di Lazzaro … indicated … ‘….it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier’, but their study does not mean the Shroud image could only have been created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection …Prof. Di Lazzaro is trying to have it both ways.

It has no “special twined and knotted fringes known as tzitzit attached to its four corners” (Wikipedia) and nor is it “made of wool” as “Most traditional tallitot (plural of tallit) … are” (Wikipedia).As has been previously commented, given the very high quality of the Shroud’s 3:1 herringbone twill weave, it is possible that the cloth may not have been originally intended to be for a burial shroud. The Gospels record that Joseph of Arimathea “bought some linen cloth” (Mk 15:46) hurriedly because “the Sabbath was about to begin” (Lk 23:53-54). So the linen cloth that Joseph bought many have been intended for clothing or a tallit.But short of asking Joseph of Arimathea when we get to Heaven (and even he might not know what the cloth he bought was intended for!) it seems inherently impossible to resolve this question.Nevertheless, I look forward to reading the gist of John Lupia’s argument.Stephen","date":"March 2, 2010 at 8:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">I do not think the translation that reads Joseph of Arimathea “bought some linen cloth,” is expressing the author’s intended senseJohn’s “I do not think” is a big climb-down from his original claim that, “the role Joseph of Arimathea played with the Shroud it has been completely obscured by inept translations” (my emphasis).>It should be pointed out that “agorasas” does not exclusively mean “to purchase, or to buy”, since it can also mean “redeem” or “to pay the tax”.Again, John’s “not exclusively” and “it can also mean” is also a big climb-down from his original claim above.And according to my computerised Parsons NT Greek-English  Dictionary (to save me going through and quoting my hardcopy lexicons), agorasas is a variant of the verb agorazo, which primarily means “to go to market, i.e. (by impl.) to purchase” and only secondarily means “spec. to redeem” hence its overall meaning is “buy, redeem” in that order.Now sometimes the secondary meaning of a word can be the correct one in that context, but that is a case John would have to argue on its merits, not by dismissing out of hand ALL (by implication) “translations” of Mark 15:46 as “inept”.>since it was a Jewish holy day and it is scarcely conceivable that shops selling linen or anything else were open.The Gospels make it clear that it was before the Sabbath: Mk 14:42 “It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath),” which was also the Passover that year). And so there was no reason why the markets would not have still been open until sundown. Besides, redeeming linen would be just as much a problem as buying it if there were no “shops selling linen or anything else … open.”And so in the context, Joseph of Arimathea buying new pieces of linen in the Jerusalem markets, fits better than him, a wealthy member of the Sanhedrin, redeeming used linen. Even if it be granted that “redeeming” was a usual term for buying used linen, which seems unlikely, as “redeem” has the meaning of buying back something that one formerly owned, i.e. “To recover ownership of by paying a specified sum” (The Free Dictionary). Which is especially unlikely in the case of the “rich man” Joseph of Arimathea (Mt 27:57) that he would have to buy back (e.g. from the 1st century equivalent of a pawnshop?) linen that he had previously owned!Stephen","date":"March 4, 2010 at 10:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">the Shroud width does not measure 111 cm, but 113 to 113.7.Thanks to John for that latest measurement. I would appreciate a reference for it. So even on John’s own admission there is no one exact measurement of the Shroud, but only a range of measurements.That is also close enough (for me at least) to 2 x the Assyrian Royal cubit of 55.6 cm = 111.2 cm.Given that: 1. it is impossible to know what the exact original dimensions of the Shroud were, given that for centuries it has been stretched, using weights, by  hanging it both vertically and horizontally; 2. it is unreasonable to demand that a ~2,000 year-old cloth, produced when measurements were cubits, based on the length of part of a man’s arm and finger breadths, should conform exactly to the very centimetre or millimetre, to a multiple of an idealised average of one of those cubits, i.e. the Assyrian Royal cubit of 55.6 cm.>The unit of measurement you are applying is the wrong one. Short of omniscience or a time machine, John cannot know that. His extreme dogmatism and absolutism is out of place in the field of Shroud studies. It is entirely possible that the Shroud was originally woven in the 1st century in Syria and intended to conform by its weaver to approximately 8 x 2 Assyrian Royal cubits. >I think we actually might be saying the same thing, in a sense, since you are assertive that the Shroud can be shown to conform to an ancient unit of measurement, just as I do.No. John’s claim originally was that: “The dimensions of the Shroud do not conform to 8 x 2 cubits of any sort” and he has never actually retracted that. My claim is that the dimensions of the Shroud would likely have originally conformed approximately to 8 x 2 of the Assyrian King’s cubit (~ 55 cm) or more likely Royal cubit (~55.6 cm).>The only difference is I found another ancient unit that works much better.Great! But paradoxically, if John’s proposed different ancient unit of measurement yields exactly the dimensions of the Shroud today, then it is almost certainly not the originally unit of measurement used by the weaver of the Shroud’s linen. That is because: 1) ancient units of measurement and their application were not exact (see above); 2) due to centuries of stretching the Shroud, both horizontally and vertically, as uncountable numbers of clerics held it up for display, with weights to stop it from flapping (it is approx. 4 x 1 metres yet only as thick as a shirt), as documented in art and photographs; and 3) an unknown length of the Shroud was cut off for relics; it is highly unlikely that the Shroud’s dimensions today are what it originally was, even if we could reconstruct exactly how much has been cut from its length.>I think you will be very pleased when you read about it.Sorry, but given John’s extremist dogmatic claims, to the effect that everyone else is wrong and only he is right, I agree with the commenter who wrote: “I think I’ll wait on the reviews before I spend this kind of money.”Stephen","date":"March 5, 2010 at 12:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"John>The Pesach Eve is a Jewish holy day, not only the Pesach (Passover). Whatever the Jewish custom is today, the Gospels don’t say that the Day of Preparation, on which Jesus was crucified (Mk 15:42; Lk 23:54; Jn 19:31) was then in the 1st century a holy day in which no work, such as buying and selling could be done. In fact the emphasis of the Gospels is that Jesus’ body had to be removed before sundown, because it would then be the Sabbath (when no work could be done – Lk 23:53-24:1), and the Jews did not want the bodies left on their crosses to defile that holy day:Jn 19:31. Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.>I can see you never understood my point that Joseph of Arimathea purchased back or redeemed the tallit of Jesus won in a dice game at the crucifixion.I did not even know that was your point, because as far as I know, you had not stated it here. But the Gospels say nothing about Joseph of Arimathea redeeming Jesus’ tallit, when they surely would have (it being a redemption theme) if it happened.Besides, the Gospels have a word for tallit, Gk. himation “garment, robe, cloak.” It is highly likely that a tallit is meant when the Gk. kraspedon “a fringe or tassel” is used in conjunction with it, e.g. the woman with a haemorrhage and others being healed by merely touching the “hem,” “edge” or “border” of Jesus’ garment (Mt 9:20; 14:36; Mk 6:56; Lk 8:44) and also when Jesus criticised the Scribes and Pharisees because they made “the tassels on their garments long” (Mt 23:5). So if Joseph had bought back from the Roman solders Jesus’ himation at least one of the Gospels would surely have said so. It doesn’t make sense that Mark, just after recording that the soldiers “parted his garments himatia” (Mk 15:24 KJV), would then say that “Joseph bought some linen cloth [sindona]” (Mk 15:46).Anyway, in researching the Gk. himation on my computerised Parson’s Greek-English Dictionary, I found a clear refutation of your theory that the Shroud is Jesus’ tallit, and that is Mt 27:59 which states that: “Joseph took the body” and “wrapped it in a clean [Gk. katharos] linen cloth,” because Jesus’ outer garment by that stage would have been anything but clean, it having been placed back over his bleeding scourged body (Mt 27:31; Mk 15:20).Also, in Googling “shroud tallit” I found that the theory that the Shroud is a tallit, had been proposed by a Donald Smith in 1997:“Donald Smith, a new BSTS member from North London, has written inviting any Newsletter readers with the requisite specialist knowledge to get in touch with him to discuss a hypothesis he is working on that the Shroud was first a Jewish ‘Tallit’. Otherwise known as a pallium or himation, the measurements he gives for this are 118,4 cm by 444 cm – proportions of one to 3.74, rather than one to four as in the case of the Shroud. Working with 444mm as the Roman cubit and 555mm as the ‘legal’ or ‘Talmudic’ cubit, he proposes that the Shroud’s original length was 10 Roman or 8 Jewish cubits. He maintains that the Shroud is lacking a second seam with identical ‘hem’ and two corners, besides those known not to be original. He believes that all four corners, with ‘gams’ (letter-like forms created in appliqué ribbon) were cut away. The two corner patches we do have are unequal in length, according to him, because an end-strip of similar width to the seam and ‘hem’ combined was also, and last of all, removed. It was also these strips, he suggests, which made it possible to tie it as a ‘bag’.” (BSTS Newsletter, No. 46, Nov/Dec 1997).So the problem is not that the Shroud may have been a Jewish tallit: I said at the outset it may well have been. Although having now realised there is a Gk. word for tallit (himation), I don’t think the Shroud could have been actually a tallit, complete with tassels, etc, but may have been the fine linen sheet basis of a tallit, or other piece of fine linen clothing. No, the problem is your theory that the Shroud was Jesus’ tallit, because the Gospel evidence is against it.

Since Syria was the Middle-East centre of linen production in the first century, the Assyrian cubit was the likely measuring unit for the Shroud. According to the article, Guralnick, E., “Sargonid Sculpture and the Late Assyrian Cubit,” Iraq, Vol. 58, 1996, pp.89-103), there were three Assyrian cubits: the Standard (51.5 cm = 20.3 in), the King’s (55 cm = 21.7 in) and the Royal (55.6 cm = 21.9 in).The Shroud’s 435 x 110 cm divided by the middle cubit value of 55 cm is a near exact multiple of 8 (7.91), and an exact multiple of 2 (2.00), respectively. And given that the length of the Shroud has been reduced by relic-taking (Ricci, G., “The Holy Shroud,” 1981, p.7), it is not unreasonable to assume its original length was 440 cm, or 8 cubits of 55 cm. But if it is objected that the King’s cubit was rare, the more common Royal cubit of 55.6 cm would yield an 8 x 2 cubit Shroud of 445 x 111 cms, which at only 10 cm longer and 1 cm wider than the Shroud, which even if it is not granted that the length of the Shroud has been reduced by relic-taking, is still a very close approximation for what is after all, a cloth measured in a pre-industrial society. >As for the Gospel of Mark telling us about the role Joseph of Arimathea played with the Shroud it has been completely obscured by inept translations. The original Greek does not necessarily read as translations have it Surely John is not claiming that ALL English translations of Mark 15:46 are “inept” in having  “COMPLETELY obscured” the original Greek and ONLY his translation is right? The vast majority of my nearly 30 e-Sword English translations of Mark 15:46 render the Greek, “… he/Joseph bought a linen cloth …” This agrees with my Interlinear Greek translation: “And having bought a piece of unused linen …”  According to my Greek lexicons, the verb rendered “having bought” is agopasas, which is in the first aorist tense, i.e. a simple completed action, from the root agora, “market place”.

I have nothing personally against you or your theory. Indeed, I said at the outset, “It would be great if the Shroud was a Jewish tallit (i.e. prayer shawl) because it would be another problem for the medieval European forgery theory to explain.” I am only interested at getting at the truth. >If you are a Jew then you do not work on a Holy day. If you are a Roman fullo you can work since they were Gentiles and not bound by Mosaic law.So now, in order to save from falsification by Mt 27:59 “Joseph took the body [and] wrapped it in a clean linen cloth” your theory that the Shroud is Jesus’ tallit that was put back on His scourged and crowned-with-thorns bloody body (Mt 27:26-35), you are proposing yet another `epicycle’ that Joseph of Arimathea, on a holy day (according to you) circumvented the Mosaic Law by employing a Gentile to wash Jesus’ bloodstained tallit. But apart from the dishonesty in the things of God you would then be attributing to Joseph, a devout Jew (“a disciple of Jesus” – Mt 27:57; Jn 19:38; who was “waiting for the kingdom of God” – Mk 15:43; Lk 23:51), that would still be work in that it would be a Jew buying services off a Gentile on a holy day (according to you). And if only Gentiles could then work on Passover Eve (according to you) then why could not Joseph have “bought some linen cloth” (Mk 15:46) from a Gentile market stall? Since Syria was then the major linen production centre in the Middle East, it is highly likely that there would have been Syrian markets selling linen  open on Passover Eve, if not in Jerusalem itself, then outside the then city’s walls.Also the word for “bought” (Gk. agorasas), does not mean “redeem” (except “figuratively”), i.e. “Agorazo does not mean `to redeem'”:“Buy, Bought … agorazo. primarily, “to frequent the market-place,” the agora, hence “to do business there, to buy or sell,” is used lit., e.g., in Matt. 14:15. Figuratively Christ is spoken of as having bought His redeemed, making them His property at the price of His blood (i.e., His death through the shedding of His blood in expiation for their sins), 1 Cor. 6:20; 7:23; 2 Pet. 2:1; see also Rev. 5:9; 14:3,4 (not as AV, “redeemed”). Agorazo does not mean “to redeem.” See REDEEM.” (“Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words” My emphasis).There is a form of agorazo, that doe mean “redeem,” namely exagorazo:“Redeem, Redemption … exagorazo. a strengthened form of agorazo, “to buy” (see BUY, No. 1), denotes “to buy out” (ex for ek), especially of purchasing a slave with a view to his freedom. It is used metaphorically (a) in Gal. 3:13; 4:5, of the deliverance by Christ of Christian Jews from the Law and its curse; what is said of lutron (RANSOM, No. 1) is true of this verb and of agorazo, as to the Death of Christ, that Scripture does not say to whom the price was paid; the various suggestions made are purely speculative; (b) in the Middle Voice, “to buy up for oneself,” Eph. 5:16; and Col. 4:5, of “buying up the opportunity” (RV marg.; text, “redeeming the time,” where “time” is kairos, “a season,” a time in which something is seasonable), i.e., making the most of every opportunity, turning each to the best advantage since none can be recalled if missed.” (“Ibid.“).So if Joseph had bought back Jesus’ tallit from the Roman soldier who had won it in a gamble (Mk 27:35; Mk 15:24; Lk 23:34), Mark would have used exagorasas.Except that if Joseph had bought the linen privately from a Roman soldier, he would not have used either agorasas or exagorasas, since as Vine says above, they mean “primarily, `to frequent the market-place,’ the agora, hence `to do business there, to buy or sell'” (my emphasis). There is another word under Vine’s “Buy, bought,” namely oneomai “to buy, in contradistinction to selling”:“oneomai `to buy, in contradistinction to selling,’ is used in Acts 7:16, of the purchase by Abraham of a burying place.” (“Ibid.“)that Mark would have used in Mk 15:46 if he had meant that “Joseph bought some linen cloth” privately from a Roman soldier.Stephen","date":"March 7, 2010 at 9:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"John>For your own edification buy a copy off Kittel and BGD.

The Gk. word agorasas in Mk 15:46 means “bought” not “reedemed”; 3. Mt 27:59 says that Joseph wrapped Jesus’ body in “a clean [katharos “clean, clear, pure”] linen cloth” not a bloody tallit that had been washed; 4. The Gospels don’t state that Passover Eve then was a holy day in which no work, including buying or selling, could be done. Rather, their emphasis is on the need to get Jesus’ body off the cross and entombed before sundown and the Sabbath (which was also the Passover that year) began (Lk 23:54-56; Jn 19:31);5. Your theory is self-contradictory because you claim Jews could not buy linen on Passover Eve, but you claim that Joseph of Arimathea, a Jew, bought Jesus’ linen tallit back from the Roman soldier who won it in a gamble (Mt 27:35; Mk 15:24; Lk 23:34; Jn 19:24).You appear to have invested so heavily in your theory, which is the basis of your book, that when presented with evidence that is false; you take the easy way out and ignore that evidence and/or commit the ad hominem fallacy of `shooting the messenger.’However, other readers who can be bothered to have read this far, will make up their own minds on the truth of your theory and therefore the value of your book.

That is because it would be unlikely that someone would make, and another buy, a finished garment with a seam running throughout it’s entire length. But that would be consistent with the Shroud having been just a piece of linen, which is all the Gospels say it was: “So Joseph bought some linen cloth” (Mk 15:46); intended to be made into maller items of clothing which would not include the seam. Which also raises further problems for John’s theory. Why would Jesus who criticised the Scribes and Pharisees for making “the tassels on their garments (presumably their tallits) long” (Mt 23:5), be wearing a 4.1 metre long tallit, which would be much longer than required as a bed sheet for His 1.8 metre high body? John could argue that this was just the tassels, but the underlying principle is not having ostentatiously long clothing. Related to this is Jesus’ criticism of King Herod’s soft and expensive clothes (Mt 11:8; Lk 7:25) contrasting them with John the Baptist’s outdoors clothing (“made of camel’s hair” – Mt 3:4; Mk 1:6). Yet the Shroud has been variously described as “fine linen,” “fine weave,” “expensive,” and “soft” (References omitted for brevity). Jesus would be a hypocrite if He Himself wore a soft and expensive tallit, while criticizing King Herod’s similarly soft and expensive clothing.Googling on “tallit” and “length” reveals that the largest traditional style tallit today (which is also the largest of all tallits) is “72 x 84” inches “Width x Length”, i.e. 1.83 x 2.13 metres (“Tallit / Prayer Shawl,” aJudaica.com). This is nearly twice as wide, yet half as long as the Shroud’s (~4.1 x ~1.1 metres).   In response John may quote this Wikipedia article (since he is mentioned in it and may even have written it) that the typical tallit was longer in the first century:“The ancient Jewish tallit design was different than that known today. Originally it was a large white rectangular garment with tzitzyot [tassels] in each corner and was used as a garment, bed sheet, and burial shroud … Lupia shows the historical development of the tallit when its design began to change during the second half of the first century C.E. and began to take on the forms known today beginning around 1000 C.E. The long tradition of a single orthodox form of the tallit became modified in a more culturally diverse atmosphere and continued to change throughout time until it became permuted and shortened in length as the kitel, tallit katan, tallit gadol, and the more common tallit prayer shawl form know today” (“Tallit: History,” Wikipedia, 11 March 2010).Even if John was able to show that the typical 1st century tallit was ~4 metres long (yet only ~1 metre wide), he has another problem revealed by this Wikipedia article. Which is that, “Originally it [a tallit] was a large white rectangular garment … used as … a … bed sheet, and burial shroud.” In other words, his theory that the Shroud was a Jewish tallit, and not a linen sheet, is a distinction without a difference. For if the tallit Jesus wore was also his bed sheet, with some tassels attached, then absent the tassels, it would just be a bed sheet. But then the tallit of the itinerant Jesus, who often had “no place to lay his head” (Mt 8:20; Lk 9:58), would most likely have been woollen, because of its greater warmth and durability than linen, especially since the same Wikipedia article states that, “Most traditional tallitot (plural of tallit) … are made of wool” (my emphasis). Which in turn raises another major problem for John’s theory. Jesus’ tallit would be expected to show considerable wear and tear from His ~3 years’ public ministry, wearing it by day and sleeping in it at night, in usually rough terrain. Yet the Shroud’s condition is variously described as: “very good,” “surprisingly good,” “remarkably good,” “excellent,” “splendid condition,” and “like new” (References omitted for brevity). The Shroud is consistent with it having been “a clean linen cloth” (Mt 27:59) “bought” in the market-place [Gk. agorasas] (Mk 15:46) by Joseph of Arimathea, but it is not consistent (to put it mildly) with it being Jesus’ well-used tallit that had been put back on over His bleeding body that had been scourged and His head crowned-with-thorns (Mt 27:26-35).Stephen","date":"March 12, 2010 at 7:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":">Lk 23:53 KAI KAQELWN ENETULIZEN AUTO SINDONI>>“And he took it down and wrapped it in his tallit”Firstly, John’s rendering of auto as “his” above is wrong.

According to my Bagster’s “Analytical Greek Lexicon,” p.367, sindoni is the dative singular of sindon.And sindon, according to my NT Greek-English lexicons, means:“fine linen cloth; (a) for as used for swathing dead bodies … Mt 27:59; Mk 15:46 …” (Abbot-Smith, 1937, p.407);“linen 1. of the linen cloth in which the body of Jesus was wrapped Mt 27:59 … Mk 15:46; Lk 23:53 …” (Bauer, Arndt, Gingrich & Danker, 1979, p.751);“fine Indian cloth; fine linen; in NT a linen garment, and upper garment or wrapping of fine linen, worn in summer by night; and used to envelope dead bodies, Mat 27.59; Mar. 14.51,52; 15.46; Lu. 23.53.” (Bagster’s “Analytical Greek Lexicon, n.d., p.367,“a fine linen cloth … the use of this word for swathing dead bodies, as in Mt 27:59, may be seen in the letter regarding funeral expenses … a letter announcing the dispatch of a dead body … (Moulton & Milligan, “1. linen cloth … in which the bodies of the dead were wrapped: Mt. xxvii.59; Mk. xv.46; Lk. xxiii.53 …” (Thayer, 1901, p.576);“linen cloth, a sheet or wrapping of linen, probably square or oblong in form, worn by the Orientals at night (Mark 1451,52). Used also for wrapping dead bodies (Matt. 27:59; Mark 15:46; Luke 23:53 …” (Zodhiates, 1992, p.1290-91).Note that Bauer, Arndt, Gingrich & Danker’s lexicon above was recommended by John (as “BGD”), but it contradicts John’s claim. John also recommended Kittel’s lexicon but there is no entry for sindon in my one-volume abridged edition of the latter.  Thirdly, as previously pointed out, there is another word himation, which evidently encompasses the Jewish tallit, especially when it is used in conjunction with kraspedon “a fringe or tassel”:Besides, the Gospels have a word for tallit, Gk. himation “garment, robe, cloak.” It is highly likely that a tallit is meant when the Gk. kraspedon “a fringe or tassel” is used in conjunction with it, e.g. the woman with a haemorrhage and others being healed by merely touching the “hem,” “edge” or “border” of Jesus’ garment (Mt 9:20; 14:36; Mk 6:56; Lk 8:44) and also when Jesus criticised the Scribes and Pharisees because they made “the tassels on their garments long” (Mt 23:5).”On past experience, I don’t expect John to accept this evidence, so I am writing it for other readers to help them make up their own minds who to believe, the above leading NT Greek-English lexicons, or John.Stephen","date":"March 10, 2010 at 11:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"John>Your constant attacks critiquing a book you never read …I am not critiquing your book. I am critiquing your theory that the Shroud of Turin is Jesus’ tallit.And I can do that without reading your book, based on what I know about: 1. the Shroud of Turin; 2. the Gospels’ account of Jesus’ life, suffering, death and burial; 3. Jewish tallits in general; and 4. what you have said here about your theory contained in your book.If you had satisfactorily answered my critique of your theory, I would have been among the first to have bought your book. But you haven’t, so I haven’t. Remember that I am not against your theory in principle. At the very outset I wrote: “It would be great if the Shroud was a Jewish tallit (i.e. prayer shawl) because it would be another problem for the medieval European forgery theory to explain.” and I still mean that.But unfortunately you have failed to respond adequately to my testing of your theory and have instead increasingly resorted to the `shooting the messenger’ ad hominem fallacy:“Shooting the messenger … `Shooting the messenger’ is a metaphoric phrase used to describe the act of lashing out at the (blameless) bearer of bad news. In ancient times, messages were delivered in person by a human envoy. Sometimes, as in war … An easily-provoked combatant receiving such an overture could more easily vent anger … on the deliverer of the unpopular message than on its author, thus literally killing the messenger … In modern usage, the expression still refers to any kind of punishment meted out to the person bringing bad news, but has taken on an ironic dimension as well. `Attacking the messenger’ is a subdivision of the ad hominem logical fallacy.” (“Shooting the messenger,” Wikipedia, 9 February 2010)I have always assumed that when those I am debating with on the Internet start responding, not with reasoned arguments and evidence, but with ad hominem personal attacks, that is their `body language’ that they know deep down that their argument is weak.However, I am not saying that I won’t ever buy your book. I try to buy every book on the Shroud, even those that I disagree with. And it may be that, while your book’s central thesis that the Shroud of Turin is Jesus’ tallit is wrong, there is still much of value in it, e.g. ancient linen and Jewish burial practices, etc. Therefore, I look forward to reading reviews of your book from those who have bought and read it.Stephen","date":"March 12, 2010 at 9:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"stephen_e_jones","post":"GailThanks for reviewing John’s book here.>He then explains that the side strip is not original to the Shroud but added on during the time of the Apostles.This is another flaw in John’s thesis. The side strip is original, it and the main body of the Shroud having been part of the same large cloth that had been cut into three parts, the middle part removed, and the two remaining parts (the `main body’ and `side strip’) then being rejoined expertly such that the threads appear to be continuous across the two rejoined parts. See quote from the BSTS Newsletter, No. 51, June 2000 in a previous comment.>The key to his argument is the identification of the sindon with the tallit …Again, according to all my Greek NT lexicons Gk. sindon means “linen” not “tallit” (see previous comment). Also, all my 20+ e-Sword translations of all 5 places sindon occurs in the NT (Mt 27:59; Mk 14:51,52; 15:46 & Lk 23:53) translate it as “linen” except the Message translates Mk 14:51-52 as “bedsheet” and NJB translates Mt 27:59; Mk 15:46 & Lk 23:53 as “shroud.” None of them translate sindon as “tallit.”>The fact that the Shroud can be shown to be an ancient Jewish tallit demolishes the 1988 C-14 dating and opens up the question of what went wrong. Agreed that if the Shroud was a form of Jewish tallit that did not exist after the 1st century that would be further evidence against the radiocarbon-dating of it as medieval. However, even if the Shroud was an ancient Jewish tallit, does not mean it was Jesus’ tallit. Mk 15:46 says that Jesus “bought [Gk. agorasas “buy in a market-place”] some linen cloth” and Mt 27:59 says that “Joseph took the body” and “wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.” But Jesus’ tallit would not have been clean (to put it mildly) having been placed back over his scourged and crowned-with-thorns bleeding body (Mt 27:26-31; Mk 15:15-20).>The sixth chapter explains how the tallit is torn or cut at burial so that the fringes or tassels in each of its four corners are removed. This was done to the Shroud when strips of cloth were torn off its width at both ends taking these tassels with them, and the long strip replaced by the current side strip. As a look at a full-length photo of the Shroud shows, there are no such tears or cuts at “each of its four corners” where tassels would have been torn or cut off. See also “Length Measurements on the Shroud of Turin: Restoration 2002.” And again see above that there is no “long strip replaced by the current side strip.” >The eighth chapter deals with the Greek text of the New Testament showing the choice of words carefully selected by the Evangelists all refer to the same thing, the tallit. Again see previous comment that there is a Gk word, himation (“garment,” “robe,” cloak”) that is mentioned in conjunction with tassels [Gk. kraspedon “a fringe or tassel”] (Mt 9:20; 14:36; Mk 6:56; Lk 8:44).>… Jesus was wearing his tallit during the Passion and stripped of his garments at crucifixion. … This was won at a dice game by Roman soldiers and was purchased from the soldier who won it by Joseph of Arimathea. Again, the Gospels say nothing about Joseph of Arimathea buying any of Jesus’ garments off the Roman soldiers who cast lots for them (Mt 27:35; Mk 15:24; Lk 23:34). And again the Gk. word “bought” agorasas means “buy in a market place” (an agora).>The ninth chapter discusses the manufacture of the Shroud fabric as a mixture of cotton and linen and that this type of linen thread was known in antiquity.The Shroud is not “a mixture of cotton and linen.” It is pure linen with minute traces of cotton attributed by textile expert Prof. Gilbert Raes (1973) to the loom it was woven on having also been used to weave cotton. But in fact there may be no cotton in the Shroud, the traces of cotton found being part of a medieval patch (see “The Raes Corner was an early indicator that something was wrong with the carbon 14 dating“). >The conclusion is the summary of salient points and it sums up the case in identification of the Shroud as an ancient Jewish tallit.Again that the Shroud was intended to be the basis of “an ancient Jewish tallit” (which in the 1st century was basically a bed sheet with tassels – “Tallit: History,” Wikipedia, 11 March 2010) is possible.But that the Shroud is Jesus’ tallit is against all the Biblical evidence. And also, Jesus’ tallit would almost certainly have been made of wool (as most were), given that wool was warmer and more durable that linen in the rough outdoors terrain that Jesus moved and slept in for much of the ~3 years of His public ministry.John’s theory has therefore been falsified for reasons stated above and in previous comments. And again I state that I have nothing personally against John, or his theory, and indeed I personally wish that it was true.

John’s original claim was: “The dimensions of the Shroud do not conform to 8 x 2 cubits of any sort” (my emphasis).But now again he attempts to change the subject to “the dimensions cannot be translated exactly” (my emphasis). I made the points (not in this order) that: 1) the Shroud linen (if it is authentic) “is after all, a cloth measured in a pre-industrial society,” with the clear implication that it is unreasonable to expect it to conform to modern standards of exact measurement; 2) “the length of the Shroud has been reduced by relic-taking,” with the clear implication that no measurement of the length of the Shroud today can be exactly what it originally was; and 3) as to its width, the Shroud in fact does conform to one relevant 1st century measuring unit, the Assyrian King’s cubit of 55 mm, namely 2 cubits x 55 mm = 110 mm, the latter being the most commonly cited width of the Shroud; and the Shroud is only 1 mm wider than 2 Assyrian Royal cubits of 55.6 = 111 mm. I will also add:4) the Shroud is a fabric that has over the centuries been stretched, particularly lengthwise, including at times with weights, and as STURP member Barrie Schwortz pointed out in an online interview, the Shroud changes its dimensions slightly depending on the relative humidity of its environment, so the criterion of an exact measurement of the Shroud, by modern standards of precision, is inappropriate and illusory.

It is a fact, revealed first by x-rays, and available for you and anyone else to see for themselves, that “every thread in the weave of the Shroud is continuous through the seam and matches its corresponding side strip thread in position, thickness, and intensity” (Adler, A.D., 1997, “Concerning the Side Strip on the Shroud of Turin“). And it is a fact that Flury-Lemberg personally examined the Shroud during its 2002 restoration and found that the Shroud’s main body and sidestrip are two separate pieces of linen joined by a seam. It is Flury-Lemberg’s theory that the main body of the Shroud and its sidestrip were cut and then rejoined at the same time from a larger piece of cloth. And it seems to be the only reasonable explanation of those facts, which as far as I am aware all leading sindonologists (including Wilson and Whanger who originally proposed a completely separately woven sidestrip theory) now accept. If your theory depends on the sidestrip being a completely separately woven piece of linen added to the Shroud at a later time, then you would have to explain how two separately woven pieces of linen match so perfectly across “every thread … in position, thickness, and intensity.”>The Greek lexicons you have do not put sindon = tallit for some reason. Thanks for conceding it. The “reason” is that sindon means “linen” not “tallit”!>All you have done is shown that certain Greek lexicons do not have it, which is no proof at all.They are among the leading NT Greek lexicons, including BAGD which you personally recommended to me. That you have not yet cited a NT Greek lexicon which defines sindon as “tallit” (even as a secondary meaning) indicates, given your claim of extensive research over many years into the meaning of these words, that there is no NT Greek lexicon that defines sindon as “tallit.”>… you refer NOW to the dimensions of the Shroud from the Restoration in 2002 something you NEVER knew until I pointed it out to you. The same is true about the theory proposed by Dr. Flury-Lemberg, which you NEVER knew until I pointed it out to you.And I thanked you at the time for your correcting me on these points. But it is not true that I “NEVER” knew them. As I stated later in a previous comment: But Googling on “Turn [sic] Shroud: Past, Present and Future” and “seam” I found a report (which I already had on my computer but had forgotten) on this in the BSTS Newsletter of June 2000 … That is, I actually had previously read that dimensions and side-strip information in the BSTS Newsletter, No. 51, June 2000 and had saved it to my computer but had temporarily forgotten it. Anyway, this is another of your ad hominem fallacies of irrelevance. Although I had read this information previously and saved it to my computer, but had temporarily forgotten it, it is irrelevant to the truth of this matter, whether I personally did or did not know about it before you pointed out to me.>Raes … is the expert who did find cotton inside the threads at the time of spinning NOT weaving. Agreed. But it was only minute traces of cotton that he assumed was due to the Shroud being woven on the same loom (quotes can be supplied), not to the Shroud being intended to be a mixture of linen and cotton. And further research has suggested that the cotton in Raes’ sample, which was from the same contaminated corner of the Shroud as the radiocarbon dating sample was taken, was part of a rewoven patch, and there is no cotton in the Shroud itself.   >All biblical evidence supports my thesis since my thesis is based primarily on the biblical evidence. But you would need to read my book to find that out.Gail has read your book and I was responding to her review. If she got it wrong, then take it up with her. >It is rather curious that a so-called proponent of authentication of the Shroud of Turin is so driven to disprove a viable thesis that proves the Shroud is authentic.I am “driven” to follow the truth wherever it leads. It is of the utmost importance that proponents of the Shroud’s authenticity, test all theories about the Shroud, whether from anti- or pro-authenticity theorists. The Shroud pro-authenticity cause would not be helped but harmed by uncritical acceptance of a false theory about the Shroud, on the basis of that if it were true, the Shroud would have to be authentic. Apart from the ethical problem of knowingly holding a false theory because it is most convenient or effective, anti-authenticity critics would eventually discover the falsehood and the Shroud itself would be discredited, especially if it were discovered that Shroud pro-authenticity theorists knew about the false theory but kept quiet about it. >One is wondering whose side you are really on. You have no need to wonder. I am on the side of Him who said, “I AM the Truth” (Jn 14:6). And one of my guiding Bible texts is, “Test everything. Hold on to the good.” (1Th 5:21).

The head was bent forward, the feet were somewhat drawn up, and the left leg in particular had moved back toward its position on the cross. Especially visible in the three-dimensional image analysis of the Shroud are the retracted thumbs and the `frozen’ posture of the chest and abdomen. As was also noted by Bucklin [Medical Examiner, Los Angeles], the entire body was quite rigid and stiff, occupying some of the positions it did on the cross.”Second, some of the bloodflows are post-mortem (another problem for the forgery theory as the distinction between pre- and post-mortem bloodflow was unknown in the 14th century):“The second evidence of death in the man of the Shroud is the post-mortem blood flow, especially from the chest wound. If the heart had been beating after burial, the blood literally would have been shot out onto the cloth. But the blood oozed out instead. Also, a comparatively small quantity of blood flowed, and there was no swelling around the wound. Finally, the blood from the chest, left wrist, and feet separated into clots and serum and was much thicker and of much deeper color than it would have been prior to death.”Third (my favourite), if Jesus’ chest cavity was pierced with a Roman lance (as the Shroud attests), and if by some miracle he was still alive after it, there would be “a loud sucking sound” coming from the spear wound as he inhaled:“Zugibe [Chief Medical Examiner, Rockland County, New York] also mentioned a third piece of evidence based on his medical experience. If Jesus had been alive after the spear wound, the soldiers and others at the site would have heard a loud sucking sound caused by breath being inhaled past the chest wound. Zugibe related that when answering a distress call after a man had been stabbed in the chest, he heard the loud inhaling of the unconscious man all the way across the room. He saw this phenomenon as `a direct refutation of the theory that Christ was alive after being taken down from the cross.'” But then why let the facts get in the way of a good story!Stephen E.
