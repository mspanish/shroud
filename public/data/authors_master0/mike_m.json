No mention whatsoever to the root of resurrection “Al-Qiyamah” in Arabic (because there is no where on hell It ties in with alchemy)  so, Max to establish the relationship goes all the way to china in alchemy but doesn’t touch the root of “resurrection” to which he claims a relation. Well, I am not convinced. But it’s my fault, I really thought he had a linguistic reference not his own speculations.","date":"April 25, 2014 at 7:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/22/stigmata-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Stigmata and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"mike_m","post":"David you are absolutely right :-) its ridiculous","date":"April 26, 2014 at 7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/22/stigmata-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Stigmata and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"mike_m","post":"Dan,“Let it go, let it goCan’t hold it back anymoreLet it go, Let it goTurn my back and slam the door” (Demi Lovato – Let It Go)","date":"May 3, 2014 at 1:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/22/stigmata-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Stigmata and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"mike_m","post":"I wasn’t talking to you.

The image on the back of the cloth is still debated. A poor photograph of the backside of the shroud is available in the following link (hat tip to Hugh)http://shroud.wikispaces.com/PROPERTIESAs you can see, ( or can’t see) it doesn’t look that there is an image there. G. Fanti believes there is, and has published a paper describing that image. He used filters to decrease background noise and increase contrast, according to him the image on the back is:1- superficial (i.e doubly superficial)2- only for the ventral figure not the dorsal one.3- three dimensional.4- corresponds to the front image location.5-slightly different from the front image (e.g. the nose on the back presents “the same extension of both nostrils, unlike the front side, in which the right nostril is less evident.”I believe the church has in its posession high definition images for the backside that has not been published yet, lets hope they release it sometime in the future.I personally believe the veil of Manoplello to be a painting. There is clearly brush strokes evident around the lips and the eyes. To me, it looks like a work of art. However, I believe the Sudarium of Oveido to be the facecloth that was mentioned in (John 20:7) “and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.” Mark Guscin has done a great Job bringing the sudarium to light.

Even with physical examination, lab tests and X-rays. Symptoms overlap for different pathologies and I have seen people get 3-4 different diagnosis from very smart people for a single problem. Barbet and Zugibe don’t have the Luxury of X-rays and lab tests., not even physical examination. They work from a photograph, so to claim that if two specialist, working from a photograph, differ on a conclusion prove them unworthy is not fair to either of them.

The scourge marks, even though they don’t fluoresce, are still very subtle and not visible in normal light. I was wrong to think they were serum, but hey, the argument still stands. Who would paint something invisible except in UV fluorescence photography? Finding the reverse of an assumption doesn’t affect the argument sometimes. just like when you thought bleached linen lightens with sunlight and it turned out to be the opposite, you admitted you were wrong but then stayed with the same conclusion didn’t you? The same applies here.3- even when they differ on the details, they agree that this is a real human being that was scourged, crucified and dead. How many dead people have you seen? They have seen much more and they are experts in this field, you are not.4-what they agreed on is beyond our scope of practice. When someone dies they call the coroner they don’t call Hugh, nothing personal.5-crucifixions in Mexico.. Hugh, you know better than this. These people are crucified north of 20 times in their life, and counting. This doesn’t compare to what happened to Jesus. This is where I find you jump from square 1 to 10 one way ticket.6-scourging produce much more blood, when was the scourging done? How many times were the wounds bandaged (with clothes) and reopened how do we assume that we know how much blood would be there?7-“bloodflow down the arms looks as if it is realistic but probably isn’t” we have talked about Garlaschelli’s paper in detail before, I am not going to repeat it here.

On the other hand, much of the Bible, in particular the historical books of the old testament, are as accurate historical documents as any that we have from antiquity and are in fact more accurate than many of the Egyptian, Mesopotamian, or Greek histories. These Biblical records can be and are used as are other ancient documents in archeological work. For the most part, historical events described took place and the peoples cited really existed. This is not to say that names of all peoples and places mentioned can be identified today, or that every event as reported in the historical books happened exactly as stated.

Glucogen is needed for ATP production.. i.e. extreme physical stress=no glycogen left= no ATP production= rapid Rigor Mortis.

This is not my speciality and I agree, a pathologist would help by weighing in here, but this is just my 2 cents. As Kelly indicated i believe it is a cumulative effect. One thing comes to mind that may help is with diabetics who are on insulin and suffer a hypoglycaemic coma. The treatment for this in ambulatory setting is a glucagon injection which can be administered by relatives or friends and it works by releasing glucose from glycogen stored in the liver. This is not the case with people who are suffering malnutrition. In that case a glucagon injection cannot be used because there is no glucagon stored in the liver. The bible doesn’t mention Jesus eating since the last supper and he was under extreme physical and emotional stress all night. He walked to gesthemani and  was up all night in prayer (for comparison, all his disciples couldn’t stay up with him because they were too tired)., sweating blood ( which happens under extreme stress) then they had to walk to Annas, then to caiaphas, back to pilate, Then to Herod and finally back to pilate, all this walking at the end of the day, instead of sleeping (I don’t know exactly how long but I am sure from the map it looks like a minimum 1.5 km each trip (just an estimate). He was being beaten and mocked all through this. Then he was scourged severely,  Scourging is enough to reduce a person into a pile of flesh. Mocking & beating  at the praetorium by a roman batallion (480-600 men heavy infantry) then he had to carry the cross to Golgotha. He couldn’t do it without the help of Simon, proving that he was completely consumed by then.

The question of the shroud being authentic or not is a scientific question not a faith question. As long as we get this right, everyone will be happy. They are 2 different issues. I don’t believe in the shroud because I am a christian. And I don’t believe in Jesus because I believe in the shroud. This is why I can understand the position of the Catholic Church (and my Coptic Orthodox Church, as per my priest) in this matter. The question of the authenticity has no bearing in our faith in Jesus. I understand that the shroud can get people who don’t believe in Jesus to think about believing in Jesus. but ultimately they have to lay down their life to Jesus, praying for the Shroud will not save them. this is why there are Christians who don’t believe the shroud to be authentic, and there are Jews/agnostic/atheists who believe the shroud belongs to the historic Jesus. The importance of the shroud to me though is that it gives me the chance in the 21st century to “behold the man”, to see how much Jesus suffered for me. It is also very dear to my heart that Jesus would leave such an imprint, His true likeness, His Photograph if you will, etched on a piece of linen for us to connect with Him.

People can, and do reject and ridicule Jesus, who is the only way out of hell. I only referenced the video because you mentioned NDE’s. These videos are not essential for my belief in hell, but the bible is. There is no mention of any Purgatory like punishment before salvation. We are cleansed by the blood of Jesus and He paid the price in full, once and for all. I don’t believe that Jesus left any room for doubt, I can list a multitude of references clearly indicating the concept of Hell, from parables to straight talk by Jesus. You are right, people would laugh at these videos, but Jesus himself said that even if people came back from the dead no one would believe them.

I have no doubt it was produced by the body ( not from an external source like an earthquake ) it is photochemical or thermochemical in nature because it is very superficial almost produced in a flash speed (as shown by ENEA’s experiments). It was not produced by fluids coming from the body because it would’ve never produced this resolution of an image. it was not produced by vapours because it is very superficial, and again resolution would be a problem. I don’t exclude a natural phenomena but I think it’s highly unlikely. So when left with a supernatural event I think the only thing that a new team of scientists can do is to continue what STRP did. i.e. new carbon dating of the multiple pieces that were clipped off from several locations in 2002. Re-examine the pollen grains from the dust that was vacuumed in 2002, re-examine the chemical composition of the shroud vs the side strip vs the C14 region. Reexamine the blood stains, is it really high in bilirubin, is it really there before the image. it would be to validate STRP work, the things that STRP scientists would’ve done if they took a second chance to examine the shroud, what did they miss and what could’ve been done better.

That doesn’t mean this person is emitting some form of radiation!Yannick, I have to disagree with that description. I think it’s even more ridiculous than the earthquake hypothesis. Some verses in the bible can be difficult to interpret (wheather figurative or literal, e.g “a day” in genesis 1) and their exist a lot of debate over those. Other verses are clearly metaphorical or symbolic in nature (e.g. “The lord is my shepherd”) while others are clearly literal (“Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.”) as you can see in the way those verses were written you can tell that it was a literal description of events. The transfiguration event is clearly literal. You see the disciples were “terrified” and they “fell on their faces” even Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah”When I was a teenager I always got stuck on this verse. I would say its in the bible, it must mean something. I totally missed the rest of the verse “For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified”(Mark 9:6)  this is not how you write a Metaphore, this is how you write an eyewitness account. Peter basically was saying gibberish and its written in the bible because… This is what happened. This is not because they saw Jesus face showing love to the Father.

To me it’s a scientific question and I believe the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of an authentic burial shroud of the historic Jesus. like the agnostic scientist Yves Delage declared “If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, an Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection”I don’t believe that 9/11 was an inside job because:1- there is absolutely no evidence it is an inside job, only speculations.2- there is a lot of evidence that its not. Confession tapes by the leader and team members of the operation. Training courses for flying but not landing or taking off, testimonies from people who interacted with the perpetrators. Money transfers, video tapes, documents recovered from Afghanistan and Pakistan etc.3-it makes sense to be a terrorist operation. Islamic extremists are among the most evil people you will ever run to in this life. Absolutely no regard to life.

Within the community of monks they usually act stupid/mentally retarded or dumb to avoid glorification by other monks. They are extremely humble and wear dirty rags. They are usually discovered by accident ( bright light coming out of their dwellings at night, sounds of people praying together where there is only one person in a room, situations where someone showed up in a place far away from where he lives with no explanation how he got there etc.) these people intentionally avoid detection so I think it’s almost impossible to get evidence for this. They  get the energy from the word of God. The father of Monasticism “Abba Antonious” was a very rich man and he heard the bible read in church, the verse where Jesus told the rich man “if you want to be perfect sell what you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” He took that verse personally and followed the commandment and started Monasticism in the whole world. So the energy is in the word of God, but how many people are willing to follow through?","date":"February 14, 2014 at 2:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/13/what-things-would-not-be-known-until-800-years-into-the-future/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What things would not be known until 800 years into the future?"},{"author":"mike_m","post":"Hi Dave,I don’t believe the writers of the gospels were trying to modify the details to impress anyone.

This is what you expect from an eyewitness account. If the gospels were perfectly matching skeptics would probably be attacking them because they were too perfect, too polished. Imagine if you rush to the hospital because someone told you that your best friend who died 2 days ago was miraculously breathing today. You rush to the ICU and there he was, standing next to his bed, now do you remember what the man who opened the door looked like or who else was in the room or what was written on the sign outside the door. And if you do remember all these things will your wife who came rushing with you remember the same details. What you see in the Gospels is just that, but they do concur on the basic foundations (the Gospel):1- Jesus was dead and buried.2- 3days later the stone was not blocking access to the tomb anymore.3–the tomb was empty.4- Jesus was alive.5- there was men/angels in/near the tomb.Mark’s Gospel is always fast paced..not much attention to details, full of actions and miracles. That’s how he wrote, doesnt mean those details didn’t happen. On the contrast, John always had a thing for details, remember he was the only direct eyewitness to those events.Jesus multiplied five BARLEY loaves (John 6:9)Distance rowed….TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY STADIA,” John 6:19)the ODOUR FILLED the house (John 12:3).The weight of spices brought to Jesus’ tomb as about a HUNDRED pounds (John 19:39).SIX stone jars….filled TO THE BRIM (John 2:9).the number of fish caught ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE….etc.Remember also John wrote much later than the Synoptics, probably motivated by the information he had and felt he has more than what people were circulating to tell.. So that’s why it looks at the Gospels from a totally different angle, complementary rather than contradictory.","date":"February 18, 2014 at 8:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"author":"mike_m","post":"“In that same hour He rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.” (Luke 10:21)","date":"February 18, 2014 at 9:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"author":"mike_m","post":"Hi Max, Arabic is my mother tongue and I have to disagree with that one. alqimyyah means chemistry, alqiamah means the resurrection","date":"February 27, 2014 at 10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"author":"mike_m","post":"Hi Max, you are right, I did mistranscribe, you see Arabic letters are very different from English and it goes from right to left. and I probably missed a Y after the i. the right word for resurrection is Al-QiYamah (القيامة).

I think it’s very significant. The Fact that whoever wrote the acts of Thaddeus didn’t make the connection that this was the burial cloths is irrelevant because he only saw it folded with the face in the middle. There is a lot of art work for the Mandylion that matches that description (a rectangle with a face in the middle).

And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast”I think James has the best explanation for this “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.”We are sinners and dead in our sins, we can only be saved by being born again by accepting, in faith, the free gift of salvation.

He was basically saying “Actions speak lowder than words” irrespective of the motive.However, I believe according to Jesus, the motive is very important, “Beware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven. So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues”…(Matthew 6:1-4) clearly Jesus is condemning people giving to the poor to be recognized by others and not out of love to the poor, which is in agreement with what Paul was saying.Also, according to the dialogue with Nicodemus being born again was imperative for entering the Kingdom of God, no mention of acts of mercy or good deeds. He also clearly said, ” No one comes to the Father except through me” so if someone is doing good deeds but rejects Jesus salvation, he won’t make it to the kingdom of God.I Agree with you that James has the correct approach.

The people who operate those machines (mass spectrometry, HPLC etc.) can tell by looking at the initial curve/slope what the analysis will be like. Jull in one of the interviews said that within 5 minutes they knew that the sample was not 2000 years old, and I believe him, because I’ve been in similar labs before. So it’s not that someone manipulated the numbers during processing the data, because you can’t fool scientists in 3 labs who were looking at the curve as the analysis was going on. The test itself would show to the experienced eye if the sample was old or young. Rather than resorting to conspiracy theories and  branding other believers as Satans (i guess its an honour since Jesus himself was accused with the same thing), there are tons of real, credible pieces of evidence that supports the authenticity and discredits the C14 date.
