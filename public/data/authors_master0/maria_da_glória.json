Shroud of Turin yarn has not uniform color due to chemical bleaching producing image artifacts the so called variegated pattern.In medieval times artisans after weaving the fabric used to bleach it by sunlight so it could have uniform color.Another important aspect,topmost fibers of Shroud of Turin threads have a polysaccharide layer -which by a chemical process of dehydration and oxidation changed color producing the image effect.this polysacccharide layer is just the residue of washing the cloth in a saponaria officinalis solutionThe way the Shroud of Turin was made fits with the method described by roman historian of first century Pliny the Elder in his book Natural History.The 3:1 herringbone twill of the Shroud indicates no doubt an expensive fabric but Joseph of Arimathea was wealthy enough to afford it.Trying to disauthenticate the Shroud of Turin with such a weak claim is ludicrous.best regardsMaria da GlóriaCENTRO PORTUGUÊS DE SINDONOLOGIA","date":"December 29, 2009 at 6:23 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2009/12/burial-shroud-proves-turin-shroud-not.html","title":"Burial shroud proves Turin Shroud not from 1st century C.E.
