There is one tradition which states that, at the moment of His death, Our Lord’s foot slipped and the footrest tilted. A highly symbolic interpretation states that the slanted bar refers to the thief crucified on Our Lord’s right side—the “Wise Thief” who repented—who went to heaven and to the unrepentant thief crucified on Christ’s left side who did not. Another explanation is that the slant is an attempt to depict that the footrest slanted downward, toward the viewer, albeit in a two, rather than three, dimensional form.”#2: “The foot-rest of Christ’s Cross is slanted because it is believed that in the final moments before Jesus gave up His spirit, His flesh spasmed and the foot-rest was kicked out of place. But in this true event there is also symbolism. The foot-rest points up, toward Heaven, on Christ’s right hand-side, and downward, to Hades, on Christ’s left. One of the Orthodox Church’s Friday prayers clearly explains the meaning:  In the midst, between two thieves, was Your Cross found as the balance-beam of righteousness;For while one was led down to hell by the burden of his blaspheming,The other was lightened of his sins unto the knowledge of things divine.O Christ God glory to You”","date":"February 6, 2014 at 3:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/06/touching-on-the-byzantine-legend-that-jesus-had-a-shorter-leg-and-therefore-was-lame/","cat":"art","title":"Touching on the Byzantine legend that Jesus had a shorter leg and therefore was lame"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Louis wrote: “I don’t see why what STURP team scientists discovered about the possibility of painting should be ignored.

Unfortunately the idea of the Shroud being one reason for the belief in Jesus’ resurrection circulating among the first disciples arose in the realm of Shroud studies and the art historian went even further by claiming that it was displayed in the Temple! It only demonstrates absolute ignorance about Jewish customs, particularly during that period, and you can sure that Josephus would have something to say about that and we would know that it was not only James the Just but many others were  thrown down from that building’s high walls.

I don’t know how stable carboxyhaemoglobin is, but at least it’s red.I’m sorry I can’t state that colour becomes “bright red.” May I assume that Goldoni et al. couldn’t state it either, as my words are taken directly from their paper, and quoted by you in the post above this one.Here’s a comment from the previous Brother Hirudo thread I wrote in discussion with anoxie about carboxyhaemoglobin:“The CO:hemoglobin suggestion is from Baima Ballone (2001), The basis behind it is that since CO is a product of hemoglobin breakdown, and CO binds to hemoglobin with 200x the affinity as does oxygen, the CO remains bound to hemoglobin in the bloodstream, and hence the bloodstains. CO associated with hemoglobin maintains a red color-this is one of the indicators of CO poisoning. CO-containing blood can stay red for over a year if teh tube remains covered (see below comment)The spectra data of Adler suggests primarily methemoglobin (deoxygenated hemoglobin) although he does mention that other species may exist-carboxyhemoglobin has a different absorbance than methemoglobin and doesn’t appear to be there to any major extent, although I am by no means very experienced with spectroscopy. Also, in communicating with those who study hemoglobin binding, they estimate that even though CO binding has a much higher affinity than oxygen, such blood would exchange out within a few days at the most when exposed to the atmosphere.Although not mentioned by Bollone, CO binding to the free heme group (separated from the hemoglobin polypeptide) has an affinity 20,000x greater than oxygen-it is unknown by me (or several whom I have contacted) if this is superglued in or given in would exchange as well. I do not know, but believe it is not permanently affixed. There would also be the problem of just how many hemoglobin molecules/heme groups would have to be saturated to result in an overall reddish appearance of the blood relative to oxidized species. Just a thought.Related to this, I had also considered that a functional group on the cloth may interact with the porphyrin ring, a CO group, such as a carbonyl group, which are prevalent in carbohydrates (glycan coating as a result of Saponaria), but the structural biologists tell me the electron imprint would appear much different to the hemoglobin molecule than carbon monoxide. Just another thought.So, you’re right in asking why would there be significant CO associated with hemoglobin-it was just one of the suggestions that was proposed (in 2001) to account for the color, originally by BB.","date":"May 29, 2013 at 3:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Yannick Clément :Important message for Kelly Kearse:  I hope you won’t miss my reply to you: https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/#comment-35257I think you will appreciate this answer from me…Yannick,Didn’t miss it.

Regarding female DNA & haploid:What is often omitted in discussions of “both male & female DNA being found on the Shroud” is that these were not the only gene segments evaluated in these studies.  Four other, non-sex related genes were included: tyrosine hydroxylase, FES, human coagulation factor VIII, & von Willebrand factor.  (Sindon 8: 39-47, 1995).  These additional genes were chosen because they are polymorphic, that is they show variation within the population-not everyone will express the same form of these genes.  This will allow you to tell if the DNA comes from one or multiple subjects.     The DNA analysis of these targets, separate & distinct from those involving sex-related genes, indicated that DNA from multiple individuals was present on the Shroud.  Therefore, no conclusion can be made.Although DNA may be fragmented, certain information may be gained depending on the extent & sites of degradation.  Paper documents fed through a shredder look pretty end-stage, but if one is looking for a particular phrase or keywords, with enough sorting it might be found.  With DNA analysis, the use of multiplex probes within the gene sequence and modern replication & amplification methods can help maximize the chance(s) of success-all depends on the particular gene targets of interest-some may be too far gone, some may not.

The reason I remember that Jesus’ blood was negative is because my mother had AB+, and when Adler stated, AB-,  I immediately thought it was opposite to my mother’s blood, and that’s how I remembered the blood type of Jesus all these years.  Adler stated it was AB negative.In conclusion, I would ask, when, since Adler’s seminar back in the mid-80s, was it determined the blood on the shroud was not AB-?Just wondering!Best,In a personal communication with Baima Bollone, through Emanuela Marinelli, he said the Rh factor (protein) was not able to be examined because it was too degraded.

I only wish to further echo, as Thibault again pointed out, that it is the collective data which must be considered.  In my own opinion, as a general comment, I believe that objectivity can become clouded over to various degrees whenever data relative to the Shroud is presented.  Take the Shroud out of it and consider the same (collective) data in the analysis of a toga or metal blade suspected to be 700-2,000 years old, containing what could possibly be bloodstains-would the conclusion be the same or different?  Would the age and/or condition of the sample be taken into consideration?  And all of the collective data dismissed as invalid or inconclusive?  Surely, of the numerous people doing numerous tests, some of them must have done some of them correctly.  And as has been pointed out in the past, it wasn’t just if blood was present that was evaluated-both sides of the coin were examined-if it’s not blood, collective data considered, then what is it?  This is just a rhetorical question, it is not meant for anyone specifically.To John,I have known Thibault (by correspondence) for several years since I first became interested in the blood aspects of the Shroud.

That is the species under comparison relative to Gilberts’ spectrum.There is no “convenient hypothesized distortion due to age” These are your words, not mine.  Sustain your own opinion, but don’t twist mine by using petty words like “convenient”.  I pointed this out in relation to a collective evaluation of the data, that it’s incorrect to expect a direct comparison with results one would obtain with relatively fresh blood.  This is true no matter what aged object is in question that is being evaluated.  It is irrelevant of the Shroud. Aztec knives, paleolithic stone tools-were those cleaned in between kills?  A one and done or was it a cumulative effect, blood drying upon blood?  I think it’s a tough comparison-too many variables, too many unknowns, too many differences.  BB shows a photo of what may be a red blood cell from the Shroud in several of his books.  It can also be seen on the Shroud iPad app.  I don’t know how many were in the magnification field or how many threads he had to look through to find it.  I would like to see microscopy done in conjunction with a gold-tagged antibody (or something similar) to show RBC specificity.  And for more bloodstains to be evaluated.  If the object in the photo was just a silica particle I would be okay with that.  I’m not wanting to make a conclusion first, then working backwards to find things that support it.  In all science, all experiments, all theories, there are grey areas.  In my experience, when it’s all crystal clear, when everything stinks (all of the data is useless) or is in total, perfect harmony (the data is all perfect, absolutely perfect, nothing is even slightly off), look out: Objectivity has left the building.   BTW, there is a huge difference between the Utzi the iceman and the Shroud.  Red blood cells were taken from tissue of the iceman because there is a body to take it from, preserved in the ice.  The Shroud contains only the image of a body, either real or intentionally fabricated.  I think everyone has to form their own opinion of whether bloodstains are present or not.  I would find it odd that everyone who has tested for this was biased or didn’t know what they were doing, or was inept at evaluating results.  I believe the best conclusion is based on a consideration of the collective data.

In my opinion, it is a big leap to go from analysis of a few fibers to “95 percent of the blood areas on the Shroud have been taken over and continue to diminish with time.”  Certainly the Shroud is not pristine with a history of being stored under aseptic conditions, of course there will be bacteria present, but in my own opinion this is extrapolation/exaggeration.  Again, my own opinion, but the “DNA of God” on the Shroud has yet to be demonstrated that it actually originated from a blood cell, and is not the result of contamination (by humans-not bacteria!).  None of the genes examined in this study are specific in that regard-I would also caution exaggeration here as well, the reported DNA sequences could have originated from blood cells, but there has been no demonstration that blood specific DNA products exist on the cloth.","date":"December 18, 2013 at 7:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/17/a-special-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse-and-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Special Guest Posting by Kelly Kearse and Thibault Heimburger"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"anoxie :Looking for elemental composition of whole blood, according to the conventional digestion method and microwave digestion method, I’ve found the following results :Ca 15mg/L; K 1015mg/L ( Ca/K ratio <<< 0.25 ~  lowest ratio according to Dixon et al. )How do we explain the difference?I am not exactly sure, just my thoughts, would be best to verify elsewhere, but in the blood the potassium levels associated with the cellular fraction are substantially higher (around 100 fold?) than those with the liquid portion.  The method you mentioned for whole blood would disrupt (release) the cellular portion, allowing everything (the total) to be effectively measured.  In a bloodstain, as the blood dries any cells present will dehydrate and die.  In speaking to a forensic scientist about this once, he explained it to me as similar to a flat tire having a slow leak and collapsing. The membrane is still “relatively” intact (i.e. not blown to bits), which allows RBCs to reseal & rehydrate during preparation for microscopy, resuming a somewhat normal morphology.  I do not known if  conventional SEM, as used by Dixon (or others) would necessarily detect potassium that may still remain within dried RBCs in a bloodstain.  This might contribute to the difference between a measurement of whole blood relative to a bloodstain.

A madhouse!”-astronaut Taylor POTA.]Here is a quote from Dr. Alan Adler’s lecture given at the Dept. Anatomy, University of Hong Kong, Shroud Symposia, 1986-this is a good summary of the perspective. “When we examined the blood areas on the Shroud at 30x magnification, it certainly had all of the normal characteristics of a blood stain.  Blood is of course a mixture of chemicals, and what one sees on the Shroud at 30x is certainly a mixture, it shows capillarity ( that is it goes through the whole cloth) and it shows cementation.  It all looks perfectly acceptable for blood except for one thing-it is too red for blood that is supposed to be some 600 to 2000 years old.  everyone knows that blood changes color when exposed to air; it changes to a methemoglobin which gives it a brown color.  So, we need to explain why the centuries-old blood on the Shroud is still so red”","date":"April 6, 2013 at 8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"From comment #9 “there is no coagulation at all – blood sips from any minor scratch) which is an simple and obvious explanation both to leakage from the body and wet staining the cloth.” Forgive, but it’s not that simple & obvious (at least to me-not being medically trained, and being somewhat dense, in general), but I am sincerely interested in your point.  Perhaps a little more patient with your explanation, if possible, I am not that sure what is meant by “no coagulation at all”  This appears to be at odds with the general conclusion that the majority of the bloodstains represents transfer of dried clotted blood.  There’s Also from #9, “My comment on hydroxiproline is in sync with the first one here( in Spanish) – to assume that human body does not have elevated levels after strenous muscle activity ( try to carry a heavy object in scorching sun, uphill and dehydrated and then talk about traces) is to purposefully omit the obvious pathology of the case.”  I did translate escipion’s original comment, I got that one, I was just noting the references referred to detection of hydroxyproline in muscle & lungs, not serum.  From the #9, follow up comment, I take it to mean that you are saying that, of course there would be elevated levels of hydroxyproline in the serum of someone that had undergone the events described in the gospel narratives, i.e. Jesus?  Is that correct or did I misconstrue your meaning?  Also, if the sample were from a bloodstain of a non-tortured individual, would the baseline levels of hydroxyproline in the blood be sufficient to detect by such methods?#11, I will briefly explain, but it might be best to hear from others as well-the point has been raised that the bloodstains look too much like fresh blood, they appear redder than what is typically observed for aged, dried blood that has undergone oxidation.  This was one of the first issues that caused many to suspect they might have been painted on. Finally, I am unclear as to what is meant by “My remarks are caused not only by this article, but the whole bunch of them and ridiculous comments on them.”  What exactly is “the whole bunch?” Are the “ridiculous comments” all of them or just certain ones?

What would be most helpful, for me (and perhaps others), is for you to comment on the specific peaks present in Adler’s spectra, pointing out the identity of which peaks could be confidently identified as particular species, and which peaks are anomalies (atypical).  For the atypical peaks, what could they possibly represent?  Treat it as a road map, start on the left of x-axis and work through the wavelength.  Additionally, it would be helpful, if you are willing, to comment on what your expected  spectral profile would look like-what you would expect the results to be-in centuries old blood.   #124, bile-pigment could not possibly survive for centuries with intermittent exposure to light, being photosensitive-would you expect trace amounts of bilirubin to survive?  None?  With intermittent exposure to light, what would be the expected breakdown products of bilirubin, would any of these appear in the spectrum at all, or completely colorless?  What other peaks of blood products would you expect to be there and where would they be?

I’m just talking about the report that uv treatment can result in the persistence of red color in bloodstains relative to those that are untreated.  I find this interesting, on its own, apart from any connection to the Shroud.  UV treatment of blood is reported to be a (not-well) understood therapy to “boost the immune system”-it may have an effect just because of the succeptibility of bacteria & viruses to such treatment, similar to treating water in a laboratory setting with uv exposure.  Some have wondered about other (deleterious) side-effects where blood is concerned, what else might be affected.  A color change, if true, would indicate that the blood components themselves may have been altered.The uv hypothesis didn’t originate with me-I included it because I try to give fair audience to all suggestions that have been made.  Not to violate the Way of Brother Hirudo, but such constant preaching about what being a “good honest scientist” is all about becomes rather stale.  There have also been suggestions from (more earlier writings) that the color of the bloodstains may vary according to the light source, artificial lighting versus out of doors.  That could be an interesting question to consider, how might the type of light used influence the perception of the bloodstain color-for those that have not observed the Shroud up close, in person, our perception is based on different photographic representations-could this be a variable or is it insignificant?

It has been reported that (fresh) whole blood applied to Saponaria-treated cloth retains a red color, whereas that applied to similar cloth that has not been treated changes from red to brown.  The red color on the Sap-treated cloth has been reported to persist for 25+ years.    In general, even apart from possibles implications related to the Shroud,  any thoughts on the molecular basis for the persistence of the red color with Sap-treatment?I can understand that Sap is hemolytic and permeabilizes RBCs, releasing hemoglobin, but why would such hemoglobin not undergo typical oxidation (as indicated from the typical red -> brown color change).  Could the porphyrin ring be stabilized through an interaction with the (treated) cloth?  Or are the differences between the reported colors both within the range of variation, is it oversimplified to base this on visual appearance alone?2. The side wound-in your view, would the fluid that appears to be mixed with the blood in this bloodstain represent released pleural fluid that has built up in the lungs-or fluid from the piercing of the pericardial sac-or both?  Also, what is the main basis for this being classified as a post-mortem wound from the appearance of the bloodstains alone-is it the blood flow pattern or the fact that just not that much blood flows, indicating that the heart was not pumping at the time the wound was made?  Related to the latter, if the wound had been made pre-mortem, and then much of the blood wiped away after the person had died, and the blood that you see resulting from post-mortem seepage from the wound, would you be able to distinguish this from a post-mortem wound, with no wiping away of blood?3. It has been suggested from viewing the negative images that the man on the Shroud  exhibits an extended chest and a distended abdomen, consistent with respiratory distress, difficulty in breathing-in your view, is this consistent with the appearance from the negatives, and physiologically does this make sense?Thanks again for your time.","date":"April 10, 2013 at 9:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Jesterof,Quick follow up to previous post on Sap-treatment, didn’t mean to imply that the oxygen had to be remaining bound here (just relating that to typical association with color change), hemoglobin could be oxidized, but why the persistence of the red color relative to that which dries on untreated cloth (brown)-can the conformation of the heme be stabilized/affected differentially as a bloodstain dries on certain textile materials as opposed to other surfaces?","date":"April 11, 2013 at 6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"#24 Yannick, I never took your remarks as a personal attack.  It is not my place to comment on whether or not I am a good scientist, to paraphrase Groucho Marx, “I wouldn’t even think of joining a club that would even consider having me as a member”.  I just try to maintain an objective approach and keep my mind open to the ideas of others.  Not directed specifically at you, but it does bother me to see certain scientists “attacked” or “semi-attacked”, I view as more as disrespected, because they are accused of being religiously biased-the irony is, without their efforts it is unclear that the concerted effort to scientifically examine the Shroud would have begun (and continued) in the first place.  But anyway, back to our own discussion, I do value your opinion.  I might suggest that you try not to be so threatened by any mention of the R word.  It’s the Shroud, I think it goes with the territory.  If the science is bogus and strictly made-to-fit, agenda driven, I believe this will be sorted out.  Alternatively, there is the bushwhack method, to head it off before it starts.  A final comment, consideration of an idea should not automatically be viewed as acceptance.  For example, if one believes that the red coloration of the bloodstains is due to some energetic resurrection event, involving some form of let’s say, uv, is it possible that the blood color might exhibit a type of gradient effect, the surfaces of the fibers on the body side of the cloth more red than those on the reverse side of the cloth?  Comparing the bloodstains on one side versus the other side, photo’d during the restoration, they don’t appear that different in terms of tone to me, although a spectrophotometric (mechanical) measurement is more objective (scientific).  One could argue that the energetic effect permeates (saturates) I suppose, but I think it’s reasonable that distance might attenuate the effect.  If bilirubin, Saponaria, CO, etc. one might expect the color to be unchanged on one side versus the other.  Which also raises the point about this being blood attached to a cloth-different sides-different histories , could this itself function as a variable in the coloration?","date":"April 4, 2013 at 6:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"jesterof, Hugh Thank you for your comments on my recent  Q.  a couple of days ago-am now back-This doesn’t have to be a closure on the thread, per se, but just wanted to acknowledge-I very much appreciate your taking the time-","date":"April 12, 2013 at 8:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Jesterof, hang in there, I am responding.Had to eat!

Whanger23, Frederick Zugibe24find at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/docslist.pdfB52) The maintenance of the red bright color of the TS blood with time was observed, but the explanation of why the color is so red is not definitive (Brillante 2002)2. From N. Svensson’s (MD) 2012 article, “Medical and forensic aspects of the Man depicted on the Shroud”, pg 4 “It is well known, that blood darkens from red to black in few days due to oxidation process.  Shroud researchers have long wondered why the TSM blood is still red bearing in mind the TS assumed age of 2000 years”3. Zugibe, chief medical examiner of Rockland County, NY (1969-2003) discusses the color of the blood in his book on pg. 216.  “A question often asked is why are the blood areas that are incarnadine in color like that of fresh blood rather than a reddish-brown color of old blood?”  He then goes on to mention Saponaria, Adler’s hemolysis (bilirubin), and that others have suggested the effect of bacterial action.  Adler was not a pathologist, but a bench scientist, porphyrin specialist, who discusses the red color of blood in many of his writings.  Zugibe and Adler were contemporaries-I have never read where Zugibe challenged that the red color was ordinary, normal-the above would seem the place to mention it.  He is also a co-author (#24) on the above paper.4. I am unable to find mention of Bucklin discussing the color-his analyses may have been restricted to more anatomical details-I stand corrected on that, although others may have heard him discuss the blood coloration-I am relatively new in the Shroud crowd, particularly in regard to when regular symposia where held.5. Pierluigi Baima Bollone is an Italian pathologist who has examined the Shroud in person and was involved in the studies beginning in the late 70s commented that the “stains that surely are bloodstains stand out on the monochrome background of the towel for their carmine color”.  He postulated that the existence of a very high amount of bilirubin in the Shroud’s bloodstains could explain the red bright color of the bloodstains, even if this colour is not directly due to the bilirubin.  He suggested that CO binding to hemoglobin, produced during the breakdown of hemoglobin to bilirubin, may be responsible for the red bright color.6. In a different type of reference, apart from the Shroud crowd, Dr. Bill Bass, co-author of the book “The Inquisitor’s Key” a historical fiction novel involving the Shroud of Turin, writes on the opening pages of Chapter 14, “…the so-called bloodstains.  That would explain why those are bright red”…”Since when is dried blood cherry red?  Every death scene I see, dried blood’s almost black.  Right”.  As mentioned the book is a fictional work, but this is mentioned in interviews to publicize the book as one of the criticisms-Dr Bass is the creator of the world renowned Body Farm and is recognized as an international expert in forensic science and anthropology.7. I know that the red color of the blood was a major obstacle for Barrie Schwortz, the documenting photographer of the STURP team-he often mentions this in interviews, stating that it took around 18 years for him to this issue to be resolved for his own satisfaction-he could probably relate conversations with individuals, including Dr. Bucklin, better than anyone, certainly much more so than me.8. I do not know if the idea was voiced originally by Barbet & Vignon, I did a quick scan through their books, but didn’t see specific mention of reference to an unusual coloring, although I might have overlooked this.A few closing remarks, when I first looked at the bloodstains, to me, they appeared much redder than typical dried blood, just in my own, everyday typical experience-I worked with a lot of mice in the laboratory, and a certain number of rabbits, and even a few rats, but was more interested in what was in the blood, rather than examining the discarded material.  Thank you again for input.  When I first became interested in the question I searched the internet for pictures of old, dried blood, JFK, Lincoln, Mayan artifacts, most anything I could find-most looked brownish to me-I also e-mailed numerous forensic scientists/pathologists asking for any comments they may have-a number did not respond, perhaps they were busy, perhaps it was the Shroud effect (although I never mentioned this was the particular situation it is not difficult to guess with a quick internet search).  On the other hand, I have received a number of helpful replies, particularly in relation to hemoglobin chemistry, (de)oxygenation bilirubin levels in blood, etc., but you are the first to directly address that the coloration of bloodstains may not be that out of the ordinary.  Yannick, if you’re reading this, I haven’t (as of today) written any pastors or priests for their input  :)    I haven’t looked at the bloodstained reference you linked, but I will be interested in doing so.

For hundred years atmosphere surrounding the shroud is almost CO free.Anoxie, The CO:hemoglobin suggestion is from Baima Ballone (2001), The basis behind it is that since CO is a product of hemoglobin breakdown, and CO binds to hemoglobin with 200x the affinity as does oxygen, the CO remains bound to hemoglobin in the bloodstream, and hence the bloodstains.  CO associated with hemoglobin maintains a red color-this is one of the indicators of CO poisoning.  CO-containing blood can stay red for over a year if teh tube remains covered (see below comment)The spectra data of Adler suggests primarily methemoglobin (deoxygenated hemoglobin) although he does mention that other species may exist-carboxyhemoglobin has a different absorbance than methemoglobin and doesn’t appear to be there to any major extent, although I am by no means very experienced with spectroscopy.  Also, in communicating with those who study hemoglobin binding, they estimate that even though CO binding has a much higher affinity than oxygen, such blood would exchange out within a few days at the most when exposed to the atmosphere.Although not mentioned by Bollone, CO binding to the free heme group (separated from the hemoglobin polypeptide) has an affinity 20,000x greater than oxygen-it is unknown by me (or several whom I have contacted) if this is superglued in or given in would exchange as well.  I do not know, but believe it is not permanently affixed.  There would also be the problem of just how many hemoglobin molecules/heme groups would have to be saturated to result in an overall reddish appearance of the blood relative to oxidized species.  Just a thought.   Related to this, I had also considered that a functional group on the cloth may interact with the porphyrin ring, a CO group, such as a carbonyl group, which are prevalent in carbohydrates (glycan coating as a result of Saponaria), but the structural biologists tell me the electron imprint would appear much different to the hemoglobin molecule than carbon monoxide.  Just another thought. So, you’re right in asking why would there be significant CO associated with hemoglobin-it was just one of the suggestions that was proposed (in 2001) to account for the color, originally by BB.","date":"April 4, 2013 at 8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"#37-Thanks, I also tried to contact the author of the 2nd link several months ago, was unable to do so successfully; flashcard 13/27 looks like the typical red to brown change in the color of aged bloodstains; this is mostly what I have run across when googling phrases like blood stains in forensic analysis, but will keep looking.I do appreciate the point abound staining material and how this may influence color.#38-40Am familiar with hyper-barometric treatment; had a friend in grad school that was treated in a chamber for a time-of course we all asked him if he had been under a lot of pressure lately…Regarding the permanent affixation of CO-Hb, several of the hemoglobin structural investigators that I have corresponded with ensure me that CO is label in iron hemes and will be replaced by oxygen if not kept under a partial pressure of CO.  Once bloodstains are exposed to air, CO should readily exchange with the oxygen molecule.  CO may have a higher equilibrium constant, but the CO concentration in air is extremely low.  The superglue comment was more directed at CO binding to free heme relative to a bloodstain, not really CO within the body; those I have corresponded with indicate that free heme tends to aggregate; aggregated material doesn’t produce a red color.  Interestingly, the red color don’t occur only when heme is bound to a protein-if ligands are in place on either side of the iron, which also prevents, aggregation, the red color persists.  This was the idea related to the thought that something may be able to mimic CO binding to the porphyrin ring, with sufficient affinity to result in a red(dish) appearance. #41-mine-going to bed!Thanks again","date":"April 4, 2013 at 10:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"#44I quick reply before heading out of the doorHugh,Yes-I couldn’t agree more.

Therefore these marks must certainly have been added later and deliberately”-this is from McCrone’s book, p. 15from p. 85 of Ian Wilson’s book The Blood and the Shroud, as we have remarked earlier, the very colour of the bloodflows as they appear on the Shroud proper (as distinct from the negative, where they all appear white), raises some very justifiable suspicions.  We all know that if we cut a finger and tie a handkerchief around it, the initial vivid red of the fresh blood will rapidly change to a dull brown, usually within a few hours.  Yet at long ago as the early sixteenth century one Antoine de Lalaing deescribed the Shroud bloodstains as ‘clear as if they had been made today’. Vignon, viewing the Shroud the 1930s, described the colour as mauve carmine”.He goes on to add, “Whatever interpretation one makes of them, I would readily endorse both of these descriptions.  In the course of my own viewing of the Shroud in November 1973, I was present on occasions when the television lights were both on and off.  When the lights were switched off and the room where the Shroud was displayed remained in what may be best described as subdued interior daylight conditions, colour-wise the blood marks appeared much different than the body image.  When they were switched on the bloodstains took on a very distinctive ‘clean’ mauve-carmine color…”The description of the color parallels exactly the phrasing of Vignon, one can interpret that in different ways I suppose, influence or best describes it/agrees.Wherever the idea originated, even if it was the opinion of just one person, would that bias influence/permeate the many who have observed the Shroud in person or studied bloodstained fibers taken from it?

Certainly there are probably many lay people here on the blog who have only seen blood from a finger cut-there have also been the reports of those that have been medically trained that have commented on the red color of the blood on the Shroud- #33.It is understandable, even by lay people, that “bloody sputum, bloody saliva, bloody gastric contents, [bloody urine], blood stains from the initial cut during the start of the operation and the blood stains afterwards  will ALL look differently”, but are all of those types of stains represented on the Shroud, ventral & dorsal?

Are there spectral studies from leech-digests available that would provide an example that such chemistry occurs?  These are reasonable questions.2) The samples utilized by Adler to mimic a traumatic clot exudate were created by mixing drops of whole blood (finger stick) with drops of a commercially available (ca) bilirubin/albumin diagnostic standard.  Dried whole blood, (ca) bilirubin, and (ca) hemoglobin were used as controls. If one accepts that Adler knew what he was doing, which, correct me if I’m wrong, but it sounds as though it’s leaning that way, then what is the purpose for him having to be so creative-resorting to “new chemistry” Is the idea of methemoglobin + bilirubin really that far out?  To completely disregard Adler’s idea, for me it might be more convincing if spectral data of (unrelated) aged samples that contain a high level of bilirubin were produced, which don’t match the reported spectra of Shroud samples.  I am not an expert in the spectral analysis of porphryins, and have limited experience in spectroscopy in general.   For me personally, a basic experiment I would like to see (in Adler’s studies) is spectral analysis of simulated samples where increasing amounts of bilirubin were added.  Also, this is somewhat simplified, but parallel spots of such samples that were allowed to dry onto cloth, and observed a few weeks later to monitor the color.

As you are aware, I believe it is possible for a science professional to check his or her personal beliefs in their back pocket, locked securely, in the analysis of experimental results-the data is the data.I mentioned this in the above only as a personal reflection, at the end.  The major focus is on the objective discussion of the science.Bilirubin and Saponaria are 2 potential explanations that have been put forth to explain the reddish aspect of the blood on the Shroud.  There are others: CO association with hemoglobin, and ultraviolet stimulation to alter the coloration.  Each has their merits, each has their own issues.  No visceral reaction to the mention of ultraviolet-it has been reported that uv stimulation resulted in prolonged appearance of the reddish color, just as it is reported that Saponaria treatment has a similar effect.  Forget any association with theories of image formation, etc. isn’t it an interesting question on its own, what the molecular basis could be for such observations?  Why would hemoglobin, released due to Saponaria treatment, result in the persistence of a reddish color?  What would prevent the hemoglobin from becoming oxidized?  Does uv treatment alter the association/conformation of the heme group with neighboring molecules?  I do not really know at “stage of Shroud science” we’re at-the collection of samples was relatively limited by nature, technology has significantly improved over the past several decades-different people, including scientists, have different ways of looking at things, different angles.  I think there still may be much more to be learned. Thus, I am willing to spend time discussing the science of an idea, even one like the use of leeches in the creation of bloodstains.   For me, it’s creative-it helps to push the scientific discussion beyond simply considering the same viewpoints repeatedly.  The coloration of the bloodstains is an interesting topic on its own-irrespective if one believes it may or may not be related to image formation.

It is hard to imagine that any respected scientist would announce a finding based a single result-repeatibility & reproducibility are cornerstones of the scientific method-this is Lab Bench 101-a single spot test would be most likely referred to as “preliminary evidence suggests”; this doesn’t strike me as a one-off.

A courtroom drama is not necessary.  One can simply read Adler’s own words published in his papers-I provided two quotes from Adler yesterday.  Here is another (different) quote from his book:“Further, in our opinion, the totality of these tests does confirm the blood images areas as blood.  The question as to whether or not the blood is human blood is best left to further immunological testing”These are Adler’s words verbatim. I don’t contradict Adler’s claims, he was appropriately cautious in his conclusions-I have gone to much lengths to support them.  You however, choose to overextend them, largely through confusion about the scientific principles behind such experiments and their inherent limitations, strongly laced with emotion.  Many reagents advertised as “anti-human” will cross-react with related species.  Adler went on the offensive with this and directly tested the cross-reactivity.  The reagents were not strictly anti-human-this is absolutely no surprise, particularly given the reagents that were available at the time of those studies.  Bollone’s experiments never addressed the issue of cross-serology.  In immunology it is imperative-the caveat is there, whether directly examined or not.  Here’s one for you: the relation between MNS and human blood was never realized in the Shroud community, even long after the results were reported by Baima Bollone (in a Shroud journal) and it was known in the serology world that MNS expression was restricted to humans.  The first time this was ever reported, and the connection made to Shroud studies was by yours truly: Dr. (not Mr.) Pandora. Was that okay or should that have been kept under wraps?Being afraid to critically analyze the data, from any and all appropriate scientific disciplines, is like an ostrich with their head buried in the sand.  Very, very deep.  The discipline of immunology seems most appropriate here, as these are immunological tests. Fear of what may or may not be learned about the Shroud from any scientific discipline is characteristic of insecurity.  Skeptics will always have ammo.  You don’t realize this, but you provide a supply line of ammo when you pretend to know what you are talking about (scientifically) and make such bold statements regarding “scientific facts.”  Unless you think you really know what you’re talking about (scientifically, immunologically), and Adler, as well as me, have it wrong?","date":"June 22, 2014 at 7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/20/everyones-own-facts/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Everyone’s Own Facts"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"The scientific tests to determine that bloodstains are of human origin involve immunological and/or DNA analysis.

It is important to be scientifically accurate.  Is this something that has, over time, been assimilated into discussions, similar to “all old blood types as AB”.  Is it the slam dunk some think it is?Providing more ammo, etc., that’s a sign of insecurity.  And consider that not being scientifically accurate or precise when talking about what is and isn’t known can be perceived as ammo as well.  Particularly for those in the scientific mainstream-it doesn’t look good, it weakens the credibility.Here is a quote from Adler’s book that you mentioned:“We were only doing a surface precipitate test; there was no way to quantify it.  So we cannot rule out the possibility that this could be some other type of primate blood.  In sum, our testing showed that the substance composing the bloodstains on the Shroud is a blood-derived material; it is definitely from primate blood, and it is the exudate of a wound.”Here a quote from Case’s book which contains a transcript of the last interview Heller & Adler ever did together: Dr. Adler: “Well you put it on, you tag the antibody with some fluorescent tag so you can see if it sticks to the surface you are putting it on.  See if it lights up.  And that’s not the world’s best immunological test.  We found that a chimp antigen gave almost as strong a test.  So our conclusion was a very simple one.  We were only willing to say it was a primate’s blood.  But we were not willing at that point to declare it was human blood.  Like we tell talk show audiences, if you choose to think that the image you see is that of a chimp or an orangutan, you’re perfectly welcome to believe that.Case: But there hasn’t been more recent testing that is specific for human blood?  Or can that be done, actually?Dr. Adler: Well it could be.  But you’d need more sample. And the ultimate test would be DNA testing.  It hasn’t been done.”   Sound like Adler was 100% willing to say human blood based on such tests?I don’t think so, but maybe it’s still “good enough”I’m am completely without forensic experience or background to judge the accuracy of the bloodflow patterns, etc., so that, together with the image on the cloth remain separate issues for me regarding the species origin of blood.  Also, for me, that is the best way, scientifically speaking, to remain as objective as possible Regarding Baima Bollone’s studies cross-reactivity with the “anti-human” reagents that were used were never addressed.

Such analysis measures absorbance at specific wavelengths of light and generates a graph, or profile, which is compared to those of various (known) blood clot controls.  The Shroud spectrum did not completely match the control spectrum of old blood (which typically turns brown).  Rather, certain peaks on the graph corresponded to another known group of compounds-the high-spin (high-iron) porphyrins: breakdown products of hemoglobin-bilirubin & biverdin.  By creating simulated mixtures of blood exudates with additional bilirubin, Adler was able to create samples whose profiles matched those of the Shroud, hence the suggestion that elevated bilirubin was present.  The spectral techniques that were used are semi-quantitative; they really only demonstrate that a particular compound (peak) is enhanced or decreased relative to a normal profile-the studies were not extended to a more quantitative analysis. Regarding “Adler’s advising the Shroud’s custodians to install extra light protection for the Shroud on the grounds that bilirubin was unstable to light”, this is only one of several factors that was mentioned, together with photochemical damage to the cloth and the images.

The intention was to be objective, not to play dodge ball.  It is my understanding that the primary intent of the spectral analyses by Adler & colleagues was to determine if the samples were, in fact, blood as opposed to paint or pigments.  These data along with numerous other chemical & immunological tests indicated that the samples consisted of real blood.  In the course of these studies, certain regions of the spectral profiles became of interest.  I used the phrase “semi-quantitative” because for the existing data, I don’t know if you can really take it much past that.  Such spectral techniques could be relatively quantitative for fresh whole blood where protein concentration could be normalized to a particular blood volume as in the paper you referenced.-with tape lift samples of dried bloodstains, it might prove more challenging.  It is possible to tell if a certain peak in the profile is increased/ decreased relative to a control (normal) profile, but I believe that generating a hard number in terms of specific amounts of blood proteins present would require further analysis.  I don’t know why the studies weren’t extended and followed up on, but reason suggests that a limited amount of sample to work with would be a contributing factor.  I never knew Alan Adler personally, but my guess is that he was not the type to shy away from a challenge.  If solid quantitative analysis were possible with the samples in hand, I believe he would have mentioned it.A few references for Adler’s published findings, including spectral data are:Applied Optics, 19 (16) 1980.Canadian Society of Forensic Sciences Journal 14 (3), 1981.Archaeological Chemistry: Organic, Inorganic, and Biochemical Analysis, American Chemical Society Symposium Series, 625, Washington DC, 1996.Proceedings of 1998 Dallas Shroud Symposium, Michael Minor, ed.

There are some obvious differences: a fairly well-preserved body vs. a cloth that is thought to have once covered a body, but I think there is some applicability, particularly in regards to the methods and technological advances.  Since the original STURP investigation in 1978, the field of nanotechnology has continued to grow, allowing studies to be conducted with greater sensitivity and much more detail.  For the Iceman, sufficient intact DNA was available from the iceman for full genomic sequencing.  These studies showed he was O-type blood, Rh positive; also, some other interesting characteristics (carrier of lyme disease, lactose intolerant, and had brown eyes).  The images of the preserved red blood cells, and their detail, are quite remarkable.  These were performed on sections taken from punch biopsies of the wound area using atomic force microscopy.  In addition to microscopic data, some Raman spectra studies were shown in the paper, indicating the presence of fibrin.With the Shroud, one is dealing with bloodstains, not an actual wound or biopsy samples, but I think there’s applicability here.  Baima-Bollone described what appeared to be red blood cells on bloodstained fibers of the Shroud using electron microscopy (Sindon Vol. 33 (1984); 9-14; also in the book, Sindon O No, Eds. Torino, IT (1990).  Red blood cells have been reported previously in mummies using microscopy (Science 108, 303-304 (1973), Science 192, 374-375 (1976), and on prehistoric rock tools (Science 220, 1269-1270 (1983), although not with the clarity available in the Iceman studies.In bloodstains, as blood dries red blood cells dehydrate, similar to a tire going flat.  What is most likely being visualized in such samples are aged blood cells that have resealed with each other during the preparation procedure, representing reconstituted cells, not intact red blood cells that have survived over large periods of time.  Because of their distinct biconcave, disc-like shape, red blood cells may be identified microscopically with relative confidence.  The new Iceman studies help to take this to another level.","date":"May 3, 2012 at 5:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/03/identifying-old-blood-one-corpuscle-at-a-time/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Identifying old blood one corpuscle at a time"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Cliff :Tabor may be onto something concrete, but it needs the critical test of time and the critique of his peers.

As far as I am aware, here is what has been reported: Garza-Valdes described (in a book) that portions of both X & Y sequences present on bloodstained threads from the Shroud.Canale and coworkers reported (in a Shroud journal) that they found male DNA with traces of female DNA present on bloodstained threads, with male DNA more abundant; further examination of the samples showed that multiple forms of other, unrelated genes were present, more than could be accounted for by one individual.     That being said, I’ve written before about (what are, in my opinion) over-generalizations about the DNA on the Shroud.  In my judgement, the sex typing of the blood also falls into this category: the data that exists is extremely limited.  In my opinion, a scientific panel or journal would not accept the conclusions based on such results.  The heterogeneity must be addressed.  The reproducibility is an unknown.  The conclusions at this stage are much too preliminary.  “Strangely, showed neither?”  This is at the other end of the extreme.

What does this mean?  It means I have time to write a more proper response.  Charles & daveb, thank you for your comments.  This is somewhat lengthy; you may wish to grab a cup of tea, or something even stronger. First, regarding where the skeletal remains and mummies came from, the title of the 1st article is “ABO typing of ancient skeletons from Israel” (should be one of the first hits on a search engine, may or may not have an accessible link).  Specifically in this study, the skeletal remains were from the Jerusalem and En Gedi region; of 55 skeletons that were examined, 30.91% were A, 14.54% were B, 50.91% were AB, and 3.64% were O.  Similarly, the title of the 2nd article, is “ABO tissue antigens of Egyptian mummies” (should also pop up using a search engine).  Specifically, 14 Egyptian mummies were examined dating from the Roman period. The reclassified Egyptian mummies may involve samples in the 2nd study, that is certainly possible.  This particular study used three different serological methods to evaluate ABO expression in various tissue samples.  Of the 14 mummies studied, only half of them gave concordant typing results (samples taken from different areas such as bone, skin, hair, muscle gave the same result).  Of these 7 that were concordant, 3 were A, 2 were B, 1 was O, and 1 was AB.  The remaining 7 gave mixed results, 5 of the 7 were AB? B?, AB?, A?, or AB?, O?.  True, this reference “is already 23 years old and we have had immense advances in the study of DNA since then!!”, but these particular studies specifically involve serological methods, which evaluate molecules on the surfaces of red blood cells, not DNA (see Figure in previous post).  It is possible that even “dated” articles contain sound science; of course, it is also reasonable that such results be confirmed and extended using more modern methods.  To quote from a recent review article on blood typing of the Shroud (available at shroud.com), “Clearly, serological analysis is most useful when corroborated by additional experimentation, especially molecular (DNA) analysis of blood group genes”.  I am in total agreement with you.  I have by no means done an exhaustive search, but there does appear to be a noticeable paucity in the studies of ABO blood type of ancient remains in more recent years.  As previously mentioned, DNA degradation may preclude confident analysis in certain cases.  If DNA sequencing is a viable option, there are many other regions in the genome (besides ABO) that may prove much more tantalizing and informative to investigators that are interested in hereditary relationships and molecular evolution.  Together, these two may (at least partly) account for the relative small number of studies that have been done with more modern molecular biology (DNA) techniques.Regarding the 2nd part of the article, as I’m sure you are aware there is controversy about when the various blood types first emerged, much of which has been fueled by D’Adamo’s promotion of the blood group diet theory.  To bypass speculation, etc. and cut to the chase, that is specifically why I phrased the e-mail question I sent out to various investigators the way that I did.  I was interested in knowing, point blank, the empirical evidence for the first (earliest) known AB individual(s) in human history. (I did not feel comfortable citing their names attached to particular quotes without specifically asking their permission; I received more responses than listed, but those quoted were entirely representative).  I specifically stuck to molecular (DNA) analysis to complement previous studies that were done by serology.  Given that relatively few (DNA) studies have been done on very ancient samples, many of the responses were heavy on the origin and appearance of ABO genes throughout human (and human-related development).  Please allow me to comment on this a bit further.  In the blood diet theory, the suggestion is that O is the original blood type, then blood type A, then blood type B, followed most recently by AB.  Structurally, this may make some sense, as type O is a core structure to which A and B carbohydrates are added on.  (Individuals contain an A enzyme or a B enzyme, AB individuals contain both, one on each chromosome; those that lack an A or B enzyme are type O).  When you examine the DNA region that encodes such enzymes, the theory begins to crack (significantly).  Studies at the DNA level that look at the specific sequences in this region in humans and human-related primates indicate that the most ancient version of the ABO gene is A (not O).  This is based on DNA sequencing and assignment of relationships among similar species.  The next blood type that appears by human lineage is B, followed by O (estimated by most evolutionary biologists approximately 1.5 million years after the appearance of B).  Type O blood results from a deletion within the A/B region, it makes absolutely no sense at all from a molecular standpoint that O would have come first.  Similarly, from a molecular standpoint of the DNA sequence, A must have preceded B (A and B differ by only a few variations in sequence, only 4 amino acids at the protein level).  Interestingly, recent studies suggest that A may have at one time been lost in the human lineage, then “resurrected” [check the Abstract-their words, not mine!!] by a recombination between B and O less than 300,000 years ago (Kitano, et al., Mol. Bio. Evol., Jan. 27, 2012).   The AB blood type does not occur without first having both A and B types in existence.  B is thought to have arisen from A through mutation and selection.  Those B individuals would be within the A population, surely some of them would have met, and things would have progressed… The selective pressures making AB an advantage/disadvantage (disease susceptibility, etc.) throughout human development, who knows?  There are a lot of unknowns. Intangibles aside, theories involving isolation of A and B populations until 1,000 or so years ago, based on the incorrect order of ABO genes during human development seem a bit of a stretch, to say the least.  Certainly, science seems to indicate that the potential for AB being present much earlier than food diet theories would suggest is more than reasonable.  Thanks again to both of you for your helpful comments.","date":"October 14, 2012 at 8:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/13/just-how-old-is-the-ab-blood-type/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Just how old is the AB blood type?"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"A follow up comment just to clarify my previous comment, which made mention of the word “cousins”.    In the aborementioned documentary, they conclude that because the two individuals didn’t share the same mitochondrial DNA & were in a familial tomb, they must have been man & wife.  The example of a cousin was simply to point out how certain family members could be related and not share the same mitochondrial DNA.  Two complete strangers wouldn’t share the same mitochondrial DNA either, but it doesn’t mean they are married.  According to the reasoning of the documentary, they would/could be.There is zero DNA evidence that the remains found in the box have anything to do with Jesus or any members of his family. Zero.  The samples tested showed that the two individuals did not share the same mother (or grandmother).  Any inferences/conclusions past this regarding true brothers/sisters versus cousins were not intended. Regarding the virgin birth, how this would happen scientifically is an interesting question.  There are numerous scenarios that have been suggested, including some that seem to stretch the imagination: that Jesus was haploid (having half the normal amount of chromosomes + an additional Y chromosome) or that Mary was underwent a type of parthenogenesis (development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg).  Others, as previously posted, suggest a more natural solution. Whether one chooses to believe in a supernatural virgin birth in the case of Jesus, is of course a personal choice.  I myself, have never had a problem believing in a virgin birth.  How a virgin birth might have happened is beyond me-that’s where faith would come in.  If you believe God created the universe and all that’s in it, then, (for me) it’s not so difficult to believe He might have a few other tricks up His sleeve.  If we knew how everything worked, life would be pretty dull.     Finally, in closing, it seems fitting to mention that cloning of a man would, in essence, be a virgin birth: in this case, man creating man.","date":"November 27, 2012 at 12:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/25/must-read-cloning-the-man-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ:  Cloning the man on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Just asking: Are the gospels truly the first time the idea of virgin birth was introduced?

Sperm and egg cells have half of the normal genetic material as other cell types (which is called haploid for half); this way, when they fuse, the developing embryo will be diploid (having 2 copies of DNA, one inherited from the father & one from the mother).  Diploid is the normal situation.  All other cell types in the body (except for sex cells, sperm & egg) are diploid, “di” for two.  The suggestion has been made that Jesus was haploid, having 23 chromosomes (half of the normal number, 46) from an unfertilized egg cell, plus a Y chromosome (for maleness), giving a total of 24.  This would certainly be unique-under normal circumstances, haploid organisms do not develop/survive.  A full set of chromosomes is important for viability.Unlike the X chromosome, which contains thousands of genes, there are only 28 genes on the Y chromosome.  Of the 28, 15 are unique to the Y, 13 have counterparts on the X.  A very small number of males (1 out of ~20,000) are XX, with one of the X chromosomes containing insertion of part of the Y chromosomes.  The Y insertion provides the necessary genes for maleness.  This type of scenario and variations thereof have also been proposed as a possible mechanism for a virgin birth (Tippler). ParthenogenesisThis word actual translates into “virgin birth” .  Parthenogenesis is the development of an organism from an unfertilized egg cell.  Certain species can reproduce this way, including bees, lizards, certain fish, amphibians, hammerhead sharks, and Komodo dragons to name a few.  Essentially, an (unfertilized) egg cell divides into uneven portions, a major portion and 3 smaller ones; one of the smaller portions can fuse with the major cell, creating a diploid embryo, which develops into a viable, normal organism.  This type of reproduction is not typically observed in mammals, but types of parthenogenic pregnancies have been known to occur, although very, very rarely.  in these circumstances, a virgin female may develop a polyembryoma, a type of tumor developing in the ovaries that may contain XY chromosomes (Garza-Valdes describes experience with such a patient in his book).  There are other chromosomal permutations as well that some have tossed out there, for example, a XXY male, known as Kleinfelter’s syndrome, all of which have associated abnormalities.I’ve never quite understood the need for such wild speculating and acrobatic tricks with chromosomes.  I think it might be an attempt to reconcile a belief in the virgin birth with a way that’s scientifically doable as we currently understand it.  In my opinion, it is most reasonable (essential) that Jesus was a physiologically normal, healthy male.  From the limited reports of molecular studies that have been performed on the Shroud, X and Y chromosomal DNA appears to be present, although contamination by exogenous DNA remains somewhat of an open issue.","date":"November 27, 2012 at 7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/25/must-read-cloning-the-man-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ:  Cloning the man on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"A brief comment to Senior110: I think crying “wolf” is a very understandable & appropriate response.

The other extreme is to keep science at arms’ length, to not approach issues of faith, to play it safe, such that their validity is not questioned.

In my opinion, science can never prove the Shroud’s authenticity, it can only disauthenticate it.  In kind, I believe that the totality of the evidence is what must be considered when in forming an opinion about the Shroud.  Science is driven by an innate desire to know and objectivity is the name of the game.  I believe that skepticism is healthy and the amount of wiggle room that’s there will vary individually.  Whether one believes the Shroud is the real deal or a grand fake, anyone interested wants to know/understand how the image got there.In the Heller & Adler experiments, the blood was digested off by proteolytic enzymes, revealing colorless fibers underneath.  I’m not sure exactly how many different samples bloodstained areas were tested.  Treatment of image fibers with proteases had no effect on color.  I don’t know if Rogers ever directly examined the effect of blood on the image.  If a negative result were obtained, it could always be argued that in the case of the Shroud, the incubation time was much longer (weeks? months? etc?).Regarding the whip marks, some of the ultraviolet light studies reveal additional skin abrasions/markings that aren’t as apparent in normal, visible light.

In my opinion, it’s not just a matter of blood being on the Shroud, but it is forensically accurate with characteristics of correct gravity flow, clotting with properties of serum halos at the edges, only visible under uv light.   Also, from an artistic standpoint alone, I think it would be difficult to first create the bloodstains, then construct the image around them.The issue of human versus animal blood is a very interesting one.  This would probably best be addressed in a separate post as there are several important points here.  The blood does appear to be human, although certain of the original studies stretched the interpretation, in my opinion.  Adler & colleagues were always (appropriately) cautious in concluding that their immunological tests only demonstrated that the blood was of primate origin.  The problem is that although a test reagent may be labeled as anti-human (meaning it was made against human albumin or human immunoglobulin, for example), it doesn’t mean that it reacts exclusively with human blood products.  Proteins in other species that are similar will also react.  Chimp albumin differs from human albumin by only 6 out of 580 amino acids.  Unless the antibody is specific for a region involving those 6, it will most likely react react with chimp (and likely other similar species).  In fact, certain antibody subclasses were discovered in chimpanzees using anti-human reagents.  The AB blood typing results help somewhat here, chimps don’t express the B molecule, gorillas show poor reactivity with most ABO reagents, especially the A molecule.  Orangutans & gibbons express ABO similar to humans.  ABO is just one of about 30 different classes of blood group molecules expressed on red blood cells.  Bollone & colleagues examined the MNS group in 1985, primarily I believe for ethnicity correlations of blood type.  These molecules were also examined in the serological studies of King Tut.  Anyway, all primates express M,N molecules, but S expression is restricted to humans.  No S counterpart is present in other species.  The blood on the Shroud is positive for MNS.  In my opinion, the blood typing (AB & MNS characterization) is really the most definite evidence that the blood is of human origin.  Together, the data lead to the conclusion that the blood is human blood.  Potential cross-reactivity is too much of an issue in much of the earlier work to conclusively make the claim that the blood is human, although these are the experiments that are typically believed to support this claim.Certain bloodstains on the Oviedo look similarly red to me, although much of the stains around the face appear to be mixed/diluted with pulmonary fluid, issued from the nose & mouth.  I don’t believe that the bloodstains on the Oviedo cloth have been as extensively characterized chemically as those on the Shroud, but everything that has been reported seems to be consistent.Thanks very much for your questions-very interesting thoughts.

In a communication last year with BB (through Emanuela Marinelli), he reported that the Rh factor wasn’t tested (too degraded to examine).  If truly negative for the Rh factor (genetically) or if the Rh protein was once there, but degraded, the readout would look the same.  Going at this with a molecular approach to see if the gene is present or not (unless DNA degradation precludes it) might help sort this out.

This is a true comparative test.  DNA degradation may preclude such tests, but it may not.  It isn’t necessary that all 20,000-25,000 genes of the entire genome be intact, just segments of of particular genes of interest.  The high copy number of mitochondrial DNA (1,000-10,000 copies/cell) is particularly advantageous in situations where the DNA is in a degraded state.  In addition, the restriction of mitochondrial DNA to maternal inheritance makes it extremely unlikely that two unrelated individuals would show identical mitochondrial DNA.Nuclear DNA, although present in much lower copy number, offers the advantage that it can distinguish if such DNA truly originates from the bloodstains or is from contaminating (touch) DNA.

For anyone that wants to cut to the chase regarding the original question, go to 4.  There are also some related comments & discussion in a previous posting: Cloning the Man on the Shroud of Turin.1. DNA from other organisms versus human DNA: It is not so difficult to sort out human DNA from that of other species.  One can use tailor made probes to target specific gene sequences that are unique to higher organisms/humans.  Regarding the Shroud, Garza-Valdes reported this for three genes: betaglobin (a hemoglobin subunit), amelogenin X, and amelogenin Y; the latter two are located on the X and Y chromosomes, respectively.  2. DNA from specific individuals: As Mario points out, this is much more difficult.  Most genes expressed in humans are the same from one individual to another.  Unless a person has a specific variation (mutation) in the gene, there is no way of discerning whom it came from or if it is actually a mixture of DNA from various individuals.  There are a certain genes within the body that are polymorphic (poly = many and morphic = shape or form), that is, they show significant variation among unrelated individuals.  Any such analysis would have to begin here.     The most polymorphic genes in humans are the class I and class II HLA genes; when a person is typed in organ transplantation for a suitable match, it is HLA expression that is being examined.  There are also noncoding DNA segments (that exist in between genes) which are polymorphic, termed microsatellite regions or short tandem repeat (STR) regions.  For freshly isolated, intact DNA, such regions are routinely used in DNA fingerprinting analysis.  In the case of the Shroud, contamination as well as degradation might preclude an effective (full) analysis, although some information might be obtainable.In addition to nuclear (chromosomal) DNA, mitochondrial DNA could also be evaluated.  Unlike nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother, only individuals with the same mother (or grandmother, great grandmother) would express similar mitochondrial DNA profiles.  This narrows things down somewhat, but the same problem with multiple contributions (contamination) would apply here also.3.DNA from a specific individual (Jesus): The main problem here is there is no DNA profile of Jesus on file to compare any results to.  Ditto with Mary.  Certain markers that are more predominant within the Jewish population could be evaluated, for example, patterns of inheritance of certain HLA markers, but this would by no means approach a slam dunk.  DNA tests are comparison tests.  To even begin to consider the question of kinship or identity (could this be Jesus?), there needs to be an existing DNA profile for comparison: a master of the Master.  In total agreement with Mario regarding the reconstruction of a full genetic profile of an individual from aged bloodstained samples.  Such scenarios are more appropriate for comic books and science fiction novels. 4. The Virgin Birth and Chromosome Number:  Very briefly, normal, healthy individuals contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46.  22 of these pairs are autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the remaining pair (sex chromosomes) is either XX or XY.  In typical human reproduction, half of the genetic material is received from the father, half from the mother.  In normal circumstances, the father determines the sex of the child by either contributing an X or a Y chromosome, to combine with the X chromosome of the mother, creating a female or male, respectively.“If the Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus, he was conceived and born of a virgin apart from union with a man. Presuming only one human genetic code/biological material, what would be expected physical evidence found on the Shroud””Basically, there are two scenarios that have been suggested: Some have proposed variations on the theme that Jesus was haploid, containing half the amount of normal chromosomes from Mary, plus a Y chromosome (or bits of a Y) thrown in: 23 plus a Y.  (see previous post on Cloning the Man on the Shroud of Turin for additional discussion)Under normal circumstances, such an organism would not survive and be arrested early in development.  It is hard to imagine how this would proceed.  Chromosomal expression is tightly regulated; even a slight variation typically results in the failure to survive or developmental abnormalities.  Apart from the scientific red flags, which are flapping heavily here, from a theological standpoint, one might wonder why God would incarnate His Son as a mutant?  I vote tinfoil hat territory on this one.Most logical, in my opinion, is that Jesus was a physiologically normal, healthy male.  For most Christians, this is implied by the faith statements, “fully human and fully divine”, “true God and true man”.  The sticking point for many, particularly in relation to a virgin birth, is where did the Y (or bits of a Y) come from?  “Apart from union with a man” and barring any type of artificial insemination involving a man, it comes down to a miraculous event, that resulted in generation/creation of the complementary genetic material necessary for normal development.  One’s own belief & faith must decide which way they want to go on this one.To sum up, some might suggest the physical evidence would be 23 chromosomes + a Y (or a bit of a Y).  The majority would propose 46, including an X and a Y, derived either through natural or divine means. Realistically, the chances of actually being able to perform a chromosome count, called karyotyping, from the bloodstains on the Shroud is astronomically remote.  In aged bloodstains, such tests are not practical as cells become dehydrated and rupture within hours of drying.  Any DNA remaining hundreds/thousands of years later is expected to be in a fragmented condition.Interesting questions, Andy, that juxtapose theology & science.  Safe to say, in any playbook, that Jesus’ mitochondrial DNA would have originated from Mary.

It is certainly true that examples of ancient samples having AB blood type in the scientific literature may be considered slight.  However, it is equally true that the scientific database of blood typing of ancient samples is, in general, slight.  In my opinion, the polls are still open-less than a few percent of precincts have reported. This is especially relevant given the small frequency of the AB phenotype in the modern population.   Regarding the Shroud, I am always careful to discuss the blood studies as “types as AB using forward typing methods”.  When one donates blood, it is first analyzed by forward typing (which evaluates the ABO molecules on the red blood cells).  Before being transfused into a patient, it is always cross-checked by reverse typing (which evaluates the antibodies against ABO molecules in the serum).  Good science always verifies itself in a similar manner.   With the AB blood type, no anti-ABO antibodies should exist in the serum-a negative result, which is what was found with the Shroud studies.  However, it can always be argued that such antibodies were originally present but were degraded over time, giving the same readout.  So, the cross-check is somewhat short-circuited: it’s a circular argument.  If the Shroud were any other blood type than AB, these results could be distinguished.  As Ray Rogers once said “Nothing is ever easy with the Shroud”.   I, myself, would very much welcome a confirmatory cross-check on the AB blood type, it’s the only way to draw a firm, solid conclusion.  If sufficient DNA within the ABO coding region were intact, this could provide a confirmatory test.  Suppose such tests could be done and the blood on the Shroud was found to be genetically type O, (which has been verified in multiple individuals using modern molecular biology techniques from 5,300 and even 30,000 and 40, 000 years old), would this then be considered as positive evidence that the Shroud might be authentic, or simply dismissed as irrelevant?   The development and inheritance of ABO blood groups throughout human history (and that of related species) is an interesting and complex subject.  Numerous questions exist that remain to be answered, apart from the context of the Shroud.  Given the relative unknowns on the origin and appearance of ABO blood types in humans, it is probably not the best yardstick in terms of possible evidence for non-authenticity.","date":"January 22, 2013 at 10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/08/positive-for-ab-is-not-the-same-as-ab-positive/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Positive for AB is not the same as AB positive"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Here is a link to a recent report in Science News, which was published in Dec 12, 2012:http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/345987/description/Human_blood_types_have_deep_evolutionary_rootsThis describes in relatively general terms the findings of a study  by Laure Seguel and Emma Thompson in Molly Prezeworski’s lab at the University of Chicago that was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

For example, in the experiments by Goldini where samples with increased amounts of bilirubin were treated with uv light, there is the additional variable(s) that the cloth used in this set of studies was treated with aloe, myrrh (& sweat).  Any affect that such compounds may have on the system (positive or negative) is unknown.  One cannot simply dismiss this by saying that because Rogers did not find any evidence for such compounds (aloe & myrrh) on the Shroud, this must be irrelevant.  Is it just bilirubin or bilirubin plus?  Experimentally, one does not know.There is also the report that neutron bombardment followed by subsequent exposure to uv results in the persistence of red coloration, irregardless of amount of additional bilirubin.This is an experimental observation-just as supernatural beliefs should be fastened in the back pocket, so should any preconceived bias against certain investigators or theories-It works both ways-focus on the data at hand.  Neutron bombardment could disrupt association of certain inhibitory substances or facilitate the aggregation of certain proteins, mimicking what’s observed in other systems.  Or it could be totally unrelated.       In the saponin system, there is the reported result that the red color persists.  The molecular basis for this observation remains to be determined.  As jesterof (Mahoney thread, comment # 184) and myself (Mahoney thread, comment #119), have questioned, it is unknown if this effect is unique to saponin or is also observed under other lysis conditions.  This would require further experimentation.  As mentioned in comments #163,169 of the same thread, relative to certain other detergents, saponin is quite efficient at disrupting cell membranes and perhaps increasing aggregation of specific proteins that could be important in such observations.  An additional variable is the method used for saponin extraction-different conditions yield different results.  To effectively evaluate these effects, such conditions would have to be normalized.Together with Adler’s results, this could all be a case of true, true, and unrelated.  Or it could be that there is some cross-talk/application between the results.  It is too early to tell-there is no one size fits all here-more experimentation would be needed, variables would have to be experimentally defined & controlled .  Otherwise, it’s too easy for it to turn into an apples & oranges game.

The question of whether billirubin by itself, or as part ofsome combined chemical reaction being responsible for the reddish colour of the blood found on the Shroud is a daunting one. Recently, and several times actually, Yannick Clement has questioned why the blood found on the Sudarium (proposed back of the head area) does not have the same colouring as the blood found on the Shroud and hense has questioned the authenticity of the Sudarium in doing so. This line of questioning along with a couple of comments made in this post has sparked a thought in my mind; Could it be possible that because the Shroud and Sudarium may have been ‘processed’ differently be the cause for this fact? Maybe the specific way the Shroud linen was processed and it’s specific chemical properties, along with a reaction to the billirubin enhanced-blood could be the reasoning? Therefore explaining the non-reddish blood found on the Sudarium. Thoughts? …Thanks,RonI would agree: comparing the two like that is as straightforward as it may seem-too many (unknown) variables could exist, both before & after the cloth received blood.  The most straightforward test to determine the relationship of the two cloths, if doable, is DNA analysis, especially mitochondrial DNA.  Even though the blood on both cloths appear to be the same blood type, AB,  this is still circumstantial, it doesn’t prove they wrapped the same person.  The only solid conclusion that could be made in such tests is if the blood types were different.  It’s an interesting point to be raised, but in my opinion, I don’t think you can go by just the coloring-the appearance of the blood is not just a function of the blood composition in of itself, but also the physical & chemical properties of the cloth before/after the blood stained it.","date":"June 2, 2013 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/01/the-orphaned-manuscript-and-the-color-of-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"The Orphaned Manuscript and the Color of Blood"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Yannick Clément :It’s not because I don’t have all your diplomas that I’m dumb…  And since I follow closely Adler and Barbet’s conclusions about the bloodstains, I think this comment of you (which is based on another comment of jesterof) can be seen as a critic against these 2 great researchers that are much greater and important than you will probably ever be my friend.

True, reconstituted, resealed cells may be detected microscopically in ancient samples under certain conditions prepared for fixed staining, but it is unclear to what percentage of the total this may represent.

Also, although it may appear that by asking so many questions, I am trying to challenge your viewpoint(s), this is not the case, I ask questions because I am interested.  Respond as time (or patience ☺) permits, this is not designed to be an overwhelming barrage. BTW, a respite is soon forthcoming, at least from me, in a few days I will be away without any internet access for 2-3 days. Some of the posts seem to get bumped around-I will number these comments to help keep them straight and make things easier to follow.1. In the link provided by Louis (Faccini article), when I look at those images, which are a computerized processing of the TS image, they appear very brownish to me, as well, absolutely, though, to be honest, to my untrained eyes, it looks as though the contrast is dialed way up here, more than in some other photographs.  This is one of the problems, I suppose, that how an image is enhanced, contrasted, photograph can influence the perception of color.  I bring this up not to disagree, just wanted to comment that, I too, see the stains in these images as quite brownish.   2A. In the other link provided by Louis (Goldini article), the last part of the paper discusses a model in which the differential appearance of the blood color “observed under special circumstances” (sunlight, without protective glass) is a result of a molecular change in the blood, some type of previous “neutron upset” that facilitates subsequent penetration of UV rays. It’s been proposed by some investigators that the blood was affected during the process that created the image.  Comments/thoughts on this mechanism related to color and/or persistence of bilirubin over long periods of time?This “charging/changing” of the blood by a uv or energetic burst (Resurrection event) so that it now, upon subsequent exposure to uv light, it appears differentially colored than when not viewed under uv,-do you think this “changing” could be explained by the Shroud simply being exposed to the sun throughout its history, including public exhibitions, draped over balconies, etc., similar to the natural effect of leaving a fabric out in the sun for a prolonged period of time?2B. In Jackson’s 1991 paper (“An unconventional hypothesis to explain all image characteristics found on the Shroud image”), he proposes that “it is reasonable to ask if analogous chemical changes [concurrent with image formation] might also have been induced in the blood.” He notes that “the off-elbow bloodstain is brown, whereas the blood flow to which it is connected on the forearm is red, suggesting a possible chemical difference between on-and off-image bloodstains”  The idea is also discussed in the 2006 paper by Fanti (“RGB analysis of the blood color: on-image and out-of image”), where the conclusion is made that “the on image blood color is really different from that of the out-of-image blood”.  Any comments/thoughts here? Do you see a relative difference in this area?  If so, could this be explained by physical, natural effects, different area/background of cloth, etc.?  Does it make sense that the proximity to the body could be an important factor relative to the color perception of the blood?[As an addendum, answer the 2A, 2B series as you are comfortable here.  I do not have an agenda other than engaging in a discussion-this is not an entrapment nor recruitment exercise.  Natural, supernatural, some combo-for me personally, I don’t want to automatically rule anything in or rule anything out-I want to look at the data and try to interpret it as objectively as possible-how science measures the supernatural, I don’t have a clue, don’t think it can, other than if something out of the known, natural laws did happen, there must be a definable, molecular basis left as a result.  If it’s there, it’s there-if it’s not, it’s not.  I am comfortable remaining open to considering all of the above possibilities.  Anyway, enough said, that’s my two cents worth (again) on that, interested here in your comments.3. Here’s a paper written by a physician, Nels Svensson, which I think you might find interesting if you haven’t already seen it. http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/SvenssonWeb.pdfFigures 10-13, Table 1 discusses a bilirubin experiment & blood color.  This was performed by dripping whole blood onto cloth.  The comment is made that in this experiment, the bilirubin is mainly composed of conjugated bilirubin, whereas in Adler’s hypothesis most of the bilirubin would be in the free form. Thoughts on the results?  Also, any affect, influence of differential fluorescent/absorbance of uv with conjugated & unconjugated bilirubin?  Does conjugated bilirubin fluoresce more/less with uv relative to unconjugated bilirubin?  Would this support the idea of uv influence on appearance of the Shroud bloodstain color?  Physiologically, (for the Shroud man) we are dealing primarily/almost exclusively with free bilirubin?  The comment is made in the paper that “it is certainly difficult to find blood samples with high levels of free bilirubin.”  Experimentally, could one examine the idea of  uv -> bilirubin: RED, no uv -> bilirubin: BROWN using a microscopic approach by evaluating blood containing increasing amounts of exogenously added bilirubin using filters to selectively block the uv?  Or a similar microscopic approach (selective filtering on & off) to examine Shroud fibers?4. A comment on the Rogers’ experiment of spotting blood onto untreated versus Saponin-treated cloth in relation to blood color. Saponin-treated samples showing persistence of red color, untreated samples don’t. The bilirubin content of the samples is presumably in the normal range and regardless, the blood samples are the same, simply divided in half.  Why the difference?I have always found these results interesting-even though Saponin is hemolytic, and therefore is going to increase the amount of hemoglobin that’s released relative to the control group, eventually any released hemoglobin will oxidize to a brownish color; and the red blood cells in the control group will dehydrate and rupture and their contents will be released as well, essentially evening things out.Perhaps the influence of the effect that Saponin may have been overly emphasized (at least in my mind), because of the proposal that Saponin has left a thin layer of carbohydrates behind which could be important in image formation.  Image formation is a separate issue. Regarding the blood, maybe there’s nothing that magic about Saponin-treatment at all-any hemolytic detergent, reagent would produce the same effect that was observed by Rogers-What’s important is that the rbc contents are released due to the consequence of holes being formed in the membrane as the cells are ruptured on the hemolytic Saponin-treated cloth.  Everything is spilling out.  Hemoglobin, bilirubin-could hemoglobin, the porphyrin ring be split by detergent action to create biliverdin/bilirubin? For the rbcs in the non-treated cloth, it’s more like a slow leak, eventually the membrane will dry out and collapse onto itself, with relatively minimal damage by comparison.  This is why in preparing samples of old blood for microscopy, rbcs can become rehydrated, resealed and return to what looks like a somewhat preserved, typical morphology.  As the cells on the non-treated cloth dry, it’s like stacking blankets upon one another, most of the contents (hemoglobin, breakdown products) remain “within”, not released. In the case of the Shroud blood, physiologically the rbcs are already being ruptured/breaking down-no need for Saponin-treated cloth to play any role here necessarily-if the cloth was treated, might enhance it over the top, lysing residual intact rbcs.Would be interesting to compare saponin-treated cloth with cloth treated with other hemolytic reagents-either soaked onto the cloth, or rbcs lysed in suspension, then transferred to the cloth-following color with time.

After all, maybe Adler was right after all!I also want to tell people to be very prudent concerning the claims made by people like Fanti and Jackson who, this is evident, wants to use every little thing they can to link the Shroud image with the Resurrection of Christ!  Personally, since both of them are not expert in blood at all and both are members of the supernatural fringe, I don’t have any time to waste in listening their “theories” concerning the blood because I know this is only biased thinking based on the “I think I see syndrom”…You do what you want but personally, I prefer by far to listen to experts in blood like Barbet and Adler.  Both have seen the Shroud in person in Turin (Adler saw it in 1997) and both have conclude instantaneously that the stains could not have been made of anything else than blood, while never seem to have been bothered by the so-called reddish aspect of it.  This speaks very loud to me.  That’s why I think that if the blood is really redder than normal under the sun, this difference must not be thought as being supernatural in any way…Question to conclude my comment:  Don’t you think that if the color of the blood would have been so strange, Adler and Barbet (both experts in blood who saw the Shroud at very close range) would have had some doubts before they conclude that this was surely the real blood of a crucified man?  Don’t you think that they would have been much more prudent in their claim?  The fact is this:  When they saw the Shroud live in Turin, both expert IMMEDIATELY conclude that this could not be anything else than real blood…  Again, this simple fact is very telling for me.  I really don’t think we should start thinking that the blood on the Shroud is so unusual that it must have been submitted to a burst of UV light!  Religiously biased science is truly the worst thing that ever happened to the Shroud of Turin…Note:  The critics contained in this comment only concern guys like Fanti and Jackson who have publicly stated that they believed the Shroud image to have been formed during the Resurrection of Christ…I would disagree with you-I don’t think I omitted that possibility, for example this comment at the end of 2A, “This “charging/changing” of the blood by a uv or energetic burst (Resurrection event) so that it now, upon subsequent exposure to uv light, it appears differentially colored than when not viewed under uv,-do you think this “changing” could be explained by the Shroud simply being exposed to the sun throughout its history, including public exhibitions, draped over balconies, etc., similar to the natural effect of leaving a fabric out in the sun for a prolonged period of time?draping over balconies, etc.”  This sound like a totally natural process to me…I would also modify your statement in that I would consider a high amount of bilirubin in the blood an usual situation-so things are not entirely normal-but of course, with a perfectly natural explanation and physiological basis given the conditions that exist.I simply do not accept the notion that if a scientist believes in the Resurrection, he or she must be disqualified in terms of integrity or honesty or good science practice.  The Shroud could be the product of totally natural events or supernatural events or some combination.  No one knows, including yourself.  Ironically, if not for the efforts of one of those whom you criticize in organizing a research team, guys like you would have a lot more free time and a lot less to talk about.  I did not become interested in the Shroud to try to prove the Resurrection.  I’m not sure how you would.  I don’t know about anyone else.  In my opinion, this constant personal criticism is rude-it dilutes the discussion from being data driven.  It makes me not want to listen to anything you have to say.  Please, enough with this constant hounding and attacking of others personal views, including mine.  It is like listening to someone over & over trying to be converted to a religious sect.","date":"May 27, 2013 at 1:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Typo there-an unusual situation","date":"May 27, 2013 at 1:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"jesterof :As a final remark – I do not think saponin was the cause of hemolysis, but it might have been the additional factor for the “fixing” the hemoglobin – in a chemical reaction with it and therefore impeding the oxidation process.

Adler, himself puzzled over it and with experimentation told me that he could duplicate the “redness” of the blood by assuming that the Man of the Shroud was a victim of blood trauma where the billirubin was some 500 times concentrated.  Dr. Gilbert Lavoie told me that he and Adler were working on this possibility and that Lavoie had, in his refrigerator, a sample of tramatized blood taken from a man who had suffered from a chain gang beating.  To my knowledge, little further was done on this because Adler passed away from a severe brain hemmorage–a tragic loss to us all.  One might ask Dr. Lavoie for input on this matter.But, to another question put to me by the late lawyer, Benjamin Wiech–why does the blood color appear to keep changing?–I responded that it will depend on the lighting that illumines it.  The “true” color is not seen unless the full spectrum of light shines on it.  (Sunlight is the best resource for this–but, of course, we do not wish UV rays to damage the Shroud and so that is usually filtered out).Hi jesterof,1. Was wondering how a bilirubin level 500 times concentrated would compare relative to the levels observed in a patient suffering liver failure or jaundiced newborn?  I realize that these are different scenarios that are apart from trauma & torture leading to death, but just looking for something to understand as a relative comparison.  Also, in terms of laboratory experimentation to create a blood simulacra, are these the levels that are necessary?  Adler remarked in one of his spectra descriptions using finger stick blood samples, that the amount of protein (albumin) they added was too high, so this would be in excess of that.  Any numbers on bilirubin levels for normal versus elevated versus extreme traumatic death?2. Also, your opinion that the color of the blood on the Shroud is not unusual, that it is not redder than expected, based on your experience has been discussed before.  You also reference it in this thread-would like to just touch on that again, if okay.  As quoted above, Adler seemed puzzled by it.I just want to understand your viewpoint, not trying to make you scream or anything. To clarify, do you believe that the color of the blood on the Shroud is not unusual, period, for any dried, aged blood, or that the color of the blood on the Shroud is not unusual for someone that had undergone such experiences of physiological & psychological stress?For those of us that aren’t experienced with observing lots of blood first-hand on a regular basis, an issue that has been commented on before by others is the question of relatively fresh blood versus that which is months, years, many years old-that is, if observation & experience with one necessarily equates with the other.  I don’t view this as a criticism, just an open question.  I also think from the discussion above, there seems to be the idea that perception of the blood color can be highly influenced by the conditions in which one is viewing it, particularly when photographs are used.     Finally, a general comment regarding McCrone and the blood:   A few weeks ago I spoke with Dr. Henry Lee, the forensic examiner in several high profile cases (OJ, Jon Benet Ramsey, Lacy Peterson).  In the conversation, he mentioned that McCrone had contacted him several times about survival of blood proteins (globulins, albumin) and the electrophoretic analysis of aged bloodstains.  Don’t know if this was to learn more regarding the tests that he, himself, was conducting-he found it difficult to solubilize the samples in general-or if he might have had some (private) second thoughts.  I have read McCrone’s book and especially enjoyed reading the correspondence between him and Fr. Rinaldi-I believe some of these are also available at the Holy Shroud Guild website Thanks again for your time","date":"May 26, 2013 at 5:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"jesterof :While discussing the color of blood stains and what can interfere with that I found Alan Adler book where the experiment of evaluating the old blood stains on the lien is described and compared to the Shroud in terms of the waveform absorption( the link below).I have to make a remark, however – while reading this and other materials I developed the impression that everybody is discussing the bloodstain on the Shroud as a bloodstains from the WHOLE blood ( if you cut yourself with a knife the blood coming from the wound will resemble the whole blood the most, but if you fell down and scratch your knee, the bloodyish fluid coming from the surface will not be the whole blood – and those will stain differently) when i reality the majority of stains on the Shroud are not the whole blood at all – and therefore the characteristics of those stains including their color can differ from the expected one from the whole blood.http://books.google.com/books?id=J2jBnDN3VxMC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=spectral+data+of+the+Shroud+blood&source=bl&ots=zenDjCt69-&sig=WmPZiDBpkxQp61QSspVy4ZjVddk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=F3djUc-uOYmi8gTL1oCIBw&ved=0CKoBEOgBMA0#v=onepage&q=spectral%20data%20of%20the%20Shroud%20blood&f=falseJesterof,Thanks very much for your previous answers So, does this mean you are somewhat revising your opinion regarding the red color of the Shroud  bloodstains or am I off base here?

The units used are just the units used, it is an agreed method, the spectrophotometry uses the wavelength absorption and then they have to use some mathematical conversion tables. I am not the mathematician or statistician and those details are beyond my knowledge. I can dig on-line to it, but I just do not see what is the confusion.If we calculate the concentration of the substance it does not matter what we will refer to – a stain or serum of the alive patient. You may calculate it by using the presented method by the dried sample on a paper ( and it will tell you how much of the substance is per volume unit of blood, or serum, since those are commonly agreed values of reference) or by measuring the whole amount in a sample of blood which will be exactly 100 ml – but the latter is just impractical.I believe it is an area of analytical chemistry which I’ve studied back in medical school, but forgive me, I have forgotten it long time ago :-)” A thread that received more blood transferred relative to one that received less will appear to have a higher concentration of that protein per surface area, even though the overall levels in the original blood should be equivalent. ”No it would not. Because they do not calculate ABSOLUTE amount of any substance in that particular point, but adjust it accordingly  to the unit of measurement.For microspottingtechniques: The adjustment is precisely the problem.  if you have no adjustment, nothing to normailize it to, then you can’t accurately quantitate the value. I realize they do not calculate absolute amount, it is adjusted or normalized-that’s where the issue is-how do you calculate unit volume for a thread, tape lift to make the adjustment?  It is like trying to calculate speed by knowing how far someone ran, but not having an accurate measurement/value for time.  Or knowing how much money someone has in their pocket from work, but not knowing how many hours they were there and trying to determine their wage.  For whole blood, serum, or pipetting a known amount of blood as shown in the link, no problem, you can make the adjustment easily.  The figures shown express the amount there per unit volume because they know the amount of volume that was used.  For a sample dried on a thread, or a tape lift, this is a great unknown-you can tell how much is there, but per what unit volume?For spectroscopy, my understanding is that this is semi-quantitative at best-a relative comparison can be made between heights of particular peaks to evaluate their general representation, but without something to compare it to, can you truly quantitate how much is there?","date":"May 26, 2013 at 8:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"jesterof :If you calculate how much does the stain weighs and then how much of that weight is hemoglobin ( as an example) an you get that it is half the weight of the whole stain you mayrefer to it as hemoglobin concentration is 50% of the stain which is also the unit measurement.

Baima Ballone, in reference to an up close visual examination of the blood areas of the cloth, once commented, “We have to bear in mind that under these traces the threads of the cloth appear to be “clean”.  This means they do not display the colouring that characterizes the image of the body, which proves that the imprint of the anatomical parts and of the lesions came about in a moment that was chronologically subsequent to when the traces in question were deposited.”  Image under blood (or not) is an interesting question.

Are we to conclude that the ventral portion of the Shroud is composed of a mixture of younger/older material?  I’ve never viewed the quad mosaic photographs as “meaningless”-the main assertion has been that these anomalies represent differences in chemical composition among areas of the cloth.  This is a very broad, ambiguous umbrella which includes the caveats that a) what these differences are is unknown & b) such differences are present in multiple regions of the cloth.  Where perhaps the tire strays from the road is that much attention, naturally, is drawn to the C-14 corner.  If one took a large piece of linen and spilled water on it (not the bottled stuff), burned candles near it, exposed it to the elements, stretched it, handled it by folding /unfolding it, incubated it in the dark, etc., would the mosaic be uniform?  Or does even a “pristine” swatch of linen show some variation in this type of analysis?  The carbon dating area clearly looks different from the immediate area surrounding it.  Rogers performed chemical & microscopic analysis to expand on this.  There are other areas that also look different from each other, but these have never been examined in detail-obviously the C-14 area was of major interest.  I don’t think one can claim the Shroud was patched in the corner by an older piece of cloth just based on this-if anything it highlights caution in making a correlation where a cause & effect may or may not exist.

The map diagrams in the paper illustrate the regions throughout the world that such signals are primarily associated with.   A previous posting had confused the authors discussion of human DNA (from India) plant DNA.The studies show that DNA from multiple plant species and (not surprisingly) multiple persons are present on the cloth.  With the latter findings, It’s important to emphasize that this is not DNA isolated from bloodstains threads themselves, but from vacuumed surface dusts. When a DNA signal is detected that correlates with a particular geographical location, India, for example, it’s impossible to know from just that data exactly how or when that DNA signal got there. The authors are appropriately cautious & conservative in their conclusions.For example, If someone who lived in the U.S. told you they found fifty euros in their pants pocket, it’s possible they could have traveled to Italy recently and obtained it themselves.  It’s also possible that someone else could have traveled from Italy to the U.S. and given it to them.  Even still, a third party could have received it from someone else and placed it there.  Without other info, one is unable to distinguish between the possibilities-all you can really say is that the fifty euros is there.  Sort of like the bird DNA they found on the Shroud-maybe a bird landed directly on the cloth at some point or perhaps the bird landed on a plant, that eventually came in contact with the cloth.The comment about DNA from flax refers to sequencing (plant) DNA from the Shroud fibers as opposed to the surface dusts.  For this to be particularly meaningful, enough genetic variation would have to exist among flax from different geographical regions-I don’t know if this is the case or not.

Certain gene sequences from the mitochondria of these organisms must overlap sufficiently with that of humans to result in the detection of even faint contaminants.  It is reasonable that mtDNA from cows, rabbits, goats, etc. (other mammals) would be much more closely related to human sequences than those of bird or worms, and would therefore have had an even greater chance of detection (although none was reported).  This is relevant as mitochondrial DNA analysis has been used previously to detect the types of animal glues used as a binder in various artworks: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/47451001_Tracing_the_biological_origin_of_animal_glues_used_in_paintings_through_mitochondrial_DNA_analysishttp://www.ijcs.uaic.ro/public/IJCS-14-33-Eriksen.pdf","date":"October 10, 2015 at 7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"I think the only thing that is certain is that it is at best uncertain.[Include bracketed version for long form].  In the current study, vacuumed dusts were evaluated, not bloodstains, and there is obvious contamination (multiple sources).  To begin to make any specific conclusion about the DNA present in bloodstains, sample(s) would have to be taken directly from there.  Regarding the amount of DNA material, who knows?  Degradation and contamination could preclude any meaningful interpretation, but (only my opinion), you don’t know until you look.  The bloodstains may hold somewhat of an advantage in that samples could be taken from the back of the cloth (even below the surface to minimize visual alteration).  Sampling from multiple sites (CODIS approach) is absolutely key.[Separate from the most recent report, DNA studies have the potential to address additional questions, including confirmation of blood type, blood touch up throughout the years, and if other types of blood (cow, goat, chicken, etc.) might also exist on the cloth, (in addition to primate which was reported).  The only other species for which any data exists is rabbit, which serendipitously fell out of the previous studies years ago (in control samples).  The species question could also be approached serologically, in ways that maximize the sample (using a sequential approach on a single sample).]  It is important to bear in mind that even sampling from bloodstained areas technically does not prove that the DNA signal originated from blood cells.  In the Garza-Valdes studies, bloodstained fibers were reported to be positive for the betaglobin gene (a subunit of hemoglobin).  All one can conclude is that the sample tested positive for betaglobin DNA.  Skin cells also contain the betaglobin gene.  Similarly, skin cells and lymphocytes both contain mtDNA.  [To definitely prove that the DNA signal originated from blood cells, one would need a means to distinguish a signal that was uniquely present in one cell type but not the other.  Lymphocytes are unique among all cell types in the body in that their receptor genes (immunoglobulin, T cell receptor) undergo DNA rearrangement as part of their normal development.  The variability that exist among immune receptors is beyond huge, but there are certain so-called constant regions without such variability (e.g. kappa light chain) adjoining the splice, which could potentially allow rearrangement to be evaluated.  Of course, degradation could be a major obstacle, though much is being done with smaller & smaller amounts of DNA.]I think there are a lot of Shroud questions to focus on, C-14 and DNA are just two of them.  Even apart from DNA studies, there are many basic questions about the Shroud bloodstains that remain unresolved.  The most important question to focus on, above all, is the message which the Shroud represents.  This extends across scientific disciplines (and beyond).  The message will remain, whether the Shroud is authentic or not.","date":"October 13, 2015 at 10:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Good question-yes, I think so, assuming there is sufficiently homology there-certainly the authors would have mentioned it if found.  Not that I think you’re doing this, but the current studies do not readily extrapolate to the bloodstains.  The bloodstains would need to be examined directly.  DNA sequencing has the advantage over immunological testing there in that it shows both the similarities as well as the differences; immunological (antibody) tests just show reactivity or no reactivity.  Only similarities are revealed, making it difficult to distinguish between the two (primate vs. human); although antibodies are now available (2010) that can do this.  On the other hand, immunological testing has the advantage over sequencing in that it specifically denotes a blood cell product; with DNA sequencing, you can’t tell if the signal comes from blood cells or skin cells.  DNA rearrangement of immune receptor genes (specific for lymphocytes, i.e. white blood cells ) would have to be examined, if doable, to specifically claim that a DNA signal was present from blood cells.","date":"October 11, 2015 at 8:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"[The XX male argument] “imposes assumptions about miraculous conception onto science in order to try and prove the assumption.”  Here a person must decide how comfortable they are in believing that God/Jesus truly performed miracles that defy the laws of science or if such miracles are merely literary devices or gross exaggerations.  Certain Christians may choose to accept selected miracles (the loaves & fishes, walking on water), whereas discounting others, such as the virgin birth.  For Catholics, transubstantiation could also be included in the mix, as it is a central tenet of the Roman Catholic faith.  A companion consideration to those above is where one’s own personal belief lies regarding whether our current understanding of science and scientific laws is complete in 2015, soon to be 2016.In the situations described in the article, the de la Chapelle syndrome, there is uneven crossing over between the X and Y chromosome.  For the 1 out of every 100,000 males who are XX, there is still an involvement of (a portion of) a Y chromosome.  True, as Tipler contends, it would not be detected by the standard amelogenin X & Y genetic tests.  But a Y chromosome (or portion thereof) would be involved at some point in his scenario, just not that region that was evaluated (hence, the “negative” result).  If God intervened as some interpret the gospel to read, is it reasonable that God would be limited to just a portion of the Y, including only enough to technically qualify as male?  Why not the entire Y chromosome?  Why would God’s Son be anything other than a perfectly healthy, normal (XY), diploid human being? Regarding the 1995 results by Canale, additional gene sequences from chromosomes other than the X and Y were evaluated.  Several are polymorphic, that is, they show variation in sequence among the population (not everyone expresses the exact same form).  These are important in that they can provide information as to whether contamination of a sample (apart from any results from X or Y regions) may be present.From http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/kearse3.pdf : “In 1995, Canale and coworkers performed DNA analysis of samples taken from both the Turin Shroud (from the soles of the left and right feet) and the Sudarium of Oviedo. Several sequences were examined, including the amelogenin X and Y genes, THO1 (tyrosine hydroxylase), vWA (von Willebrand factor), FES/FPS (tyrosine kinase), and F13A1 (coagulation factor XIII), (16). Two of these regions, THO1 and vWA, are part of the CODIS standard 13 STRs (6,7). The authors reported that contamination between male and female DNA, and all of the other sequences examined was evident (16, 17). It was stated that the presence of male DNA on the Shroud was more noticeable that female DNA, and contamination by persons who touched the cloths was considered as a contributing factor (16,17). Consequently, such results were considered essentially null and void. “","date":"December 8, 2015 at 3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Jesus, the XX Male"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Linus usit.

If blood was added to the Shroud in the medieval era, why is it so degraded that we can only claim, with some certainty, that it is primate blood? I would expect the blood, if it is ‘only’ 600 years old, to still be more useful forensically. Perhaps Dr. Kearse can provide some insight on that question.Hi David,My comments:1. The main issue regarding the primate vs. human issue is not related to the relative age of the blood older: 2,000 yrs. versus relatively newer-600 yrs. blood. Rather, it stems from the fact that the antibodies in use at the time were not capable of distinguishing human blood versus that of closely related non-human primates.  This would have been the case even if freshly drawn samples were evaluated.  Monoclonal antibodies that effectively distinguish human blood from closely related primate blood were only recently developed (2010).  The likelihood of a forger using non-human primate blood versus human blood?  I’ll leave that to others to speculate.  I don’t believe it should conclusively be referred to as “human” without scientific clarification-it stretches the data past where it should go.  Adler was well aware of cross-reactivity and was cautious in his interpretation.  2. It remains to be determined if blood from species other than primate/human might also be present-this is a blind spot in the previous studies.  The one exception is rabbit blood, which serendipitously, due to the experimental design used secondary anti-rabbit antibodies  in the system.3. It’s easy to write it off as not being blood when you’re willing to ignore certain data-how does one explain the immunological detection of blood constituents: hemoglobin, albumin, immunoglobulin?  These are signature proteins for detection of blood components.  Such studies are apart from the chemical & spectroscopic data, but of course, others will simply say all of these tests were botched or misinterpreted.  Every single one of them: botched!  By different investigators, still botched!  4. “The stains don’t look like bloodstains should”  Even many rabid-authenticists would agree.  The premise of any such argument fails to take into account the effect a treated textile might have on bloodstain appearance. This is an important consideration.Anyone who is interested in finding more information on the studies of the bloodstains of the Shroud must be willing to consider all of the data.  It can require some digging.  And the willingness to translate manuscripts/proceedings/book chapters from other languages, such as Italian, even if it requires typing much of this in by hand. And corresponding with someone who is fluent in the language.  But you have to consider all of it.  Chemical studies.  Spectroscopy studies.

This announcement is made under the banner of “The Year of Faith”.  Many are naturally drawn to the Shroud because of the importance that faith plays in their life.  The rational scientist is able to effectively realize that faith and science speak to different types of understanding. Is it necessary to declare the foolishness of all others who don’t agree with a personal viewpoint? The Shroud image may have been formed by a natural process(es) currently defined in a science textbook, that has been sitting on the shelf for years.  If so, the answer is sitting there waiting for someone to connect the dots-maybe.  Maybe there are a lot of unknowns that still remain.  The image may have been formed through the transformation of a dead body into a living one by an unknown process; after all, the resurrection of Christ is a cornerstone of the Christian faith.  Some believe that the Shroud is a testament to this event.  Will science be irreversibly corrupted by considering/exploring this possibility? I don’t think so.  Why be threatened by it? Science can speak very well for itself-if such ideas are total folly, then the data will be also-eventually all interpretations reach a consensus.   The Church as stated in the Catechism, declares that “methodical research in all branches of knowledge, provided it is carried out in a truly scientific manner and does not override moral laws, can never conflict with the faith, because the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God.”  I am a firm believer in the laws of science.  I am not convinced, though, that we have exhaustively delineated all of the scientific principles that may exist. I would suggest considering the possibility that we have only just begun to scratch the surface.   Cell phones and modern aircraft would have been unthinkable several hundred years ago-beyond laughable to most. Perhaps there is more scientific knowledge to come?  Or maybe we’ve peaked in 2013?

Should be some clarification here: human, human, human, etc. Was this truly demonstrated?  Cross-reactivity in immunoglobulin, albumin studies precludes a definitive answer from the data.  Adler was appropriately cautious in his interpretation (at least primate).  This goes beyond that.  Opinions, assumptions have to be screened out.  Relatedly, the above sentence refers to “human hemoglobin” Was the hemoglobin characterized relative to species in these early studies?   Human whole blood serum-again, species characterization-how?  Finally, “DNA from the man’s blood marks”.  Is this a scientifically valid statement?  What specifically demonstrates that the DNA is from the blood marks of the man?

A key step in Shroud science gaining more credibility, respectability is the publication of new, original research in peer-reviewed scientific journals.The best approach a scientist can undertake with his or her particular hypothesis/idea is to try to design experiments to prove themselves wrong; it broadens one’s objectivity to play the devils’s advocate regarding his or her own research.

Not a criticism here, it’s just the nature of the particular experimental design.   This could be done serologically (using antibodies) and there are ways to set it up that help to minimize the amount of sample required.

I remember reading that Dr. Adler said that it was “Primate”, but that Prof. Baima Bollone confirmed it to be human AB blood?”My Comments:1. Human male blood-this is based on the DNA sequencing results reported by Dr. Garza Valdes in his book, the DNA of God. In these studies it cannot be determined if the DNA signal originates from the blood sample or is due to contaminating, exogenous DNA.  Partial sequence of a hemoglobin subunit was also reported (same study)-this doesn’t help, this gene is expressed in other cell types, including skin cells.  Only real scientific conclusion that can be made here is there is human DNA on the Shroud. Is it human male blood? Still unknown (my opinion).   AB group-this is based on the studies of Baima-Bollone, published in a Shroud specialty journal.  Two different methods were presented, forward typing & reverse typing.  Reverse typing is especially problematic in aged samples.  Two complementary tests are really needed for a firm conclusion.  Forward typing results suggest AB, but needs to be confirmed by additional methods (my opinion). Professor Baima Bollone confirmed it to be human AB blood-the antibodies BB used were raised against human proteins, however, such antibodies, especially those in use at the time, are infamous for cross-reacting with the same molecule in other species.  This has to be tested directly for any antibody that is used..  Cross-reactivity was experimentally addressed by Adler, hence the designation “primate.”  This issue was never explored in BB studies (at least not reported).  It is a very safe assumption that such antibodies cross-react with molecules from similar species.  The designation on the label of such antibodies “anti-human” only refers to the particular protein the antibody was made against.  Cross-reactivity has to be directly examined.  It’s very similar to having your own house key and feeling very good about it as you lock the door, but then four people show up and three of them have different keys that also open your front door.  It can be a game changer.  By beating the primate drum, I am not endorsing the idea that a forger rounded up a barrel of monkeys for his or her use.

There are several books by Ricci who diagrams blood flow patterns relative to the Shroud; I remember one section in particular where he illustrated how handling of the feet could influence the overall appearance of the stain. Dr. Baden says its impossible.  Other physicians, pathologists say the bloodstain appearance, pattern its well within reason, nothing abnormal jumps out out them.  What to do there?

The antisera generated in rabbits are polyclonal, the products of many different cells (clones), meaning that multiple specificities will be represented in the sera.  More modern immunological techniques have the advantage of utilizing monoclonal antibodies (products of a single clone), where the specificity is more defined.  This on its own is not really a concern, but together with the fact that an extract was used for immunization (as opposed to a purified protein), it does urge some caution regarding exactly what the reactivity consists of.  I would like to see the specificity more defined.  This particular antisera was not obtained commercially, where the specificity is often more detailed.  The anti-aloe, anti-myrrh results were compared against non-immune serum as a negative control (that’s good), but were not cross-checked against each other in experimental stains (that would have been good).

It’s easy to work backwards and find conditions that render more appealing images, because the end result is the goal. I visited Kevin Moran one summer (who has a VP-8 in his garage) and brought along a few photos to try it out.  I tried to choose those that had prominent contrast, my top pick was the CD booklet/cover of the first Beatles album, Meet the Beatles, featuring black & white head shots.  3-D features were apparent (John was the best, the other three, in my opinion were mediocre-don’t know if they could be identified without knowing who they were), but it wasn’t great-some distortion in each of the four was evident.  The Shroud photos we placed looked identical to those in Heller’s book, collectively more detail was maintained throughout & more 3-D effect was obvious.The caption under the “control” photo of William Ercoline in Heller’s book states regarding “gross distortion of all features and the two-dimensional quality” of other photos, that “the only exception is the Shroud”.  Overhyped?  I suppose it may be a matter of opinion-clearly, you can see 3-D effects of some sort in various artworks (bas-relief, painting) using this technique.  I took it to mean that the degree of detail is what makes it “unique”, not that it is an “absolute”, one of a kind in possessing any aspect of this characteristic.  I think most would agree if it isn’t a “unique” property, it’s certainly an interesting one.  Difficult to imagine an artist, at least a painter, taking this into consideration, or even occurring via coincidence, particularly to such detail-of course, it may have only resulted after the paint had (relatively uniformly) flaked off, true appearance of the original being down the rabbit hole as it were; My own opinion is that it points more strongly to the cloth covering a three dimensional form (whatever one thinks this is).  Using software to convert light/dark flat circles into conical towers is impressive-it certainly isn’t apparent just looking at the flat shape, but I think even a skilled artist working a priori and with hand held equipment would have screwed it up somewhere, at some point-in the face, along the length of the body and some distortion/misalignment would be apparent.","date":"December 14, 2014 at 7:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/12/only-the-shadow-knows/","cat":"3d","title":"Only the Shadow knows"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"HF wrote:“I’m afraid I find Kelly’s last comment ironic. “I think even a skilled artist working a priori and with hand held equipment would have screwed it up somewhere, at some point-in the face, along the length of the body and some distortion/misalignment would be apparent.” To me, he did screw up, he did fail to appreciate a true brightness/distance correlation, and there is considerable distortion and misalignment, both in the face and along the length of the body.”Problem is how do you know what’s considerable-it’s extremely subjective in nature-morever, by any of the proposed authentic mechanism one wishes to believe in (Maillard, energy/light, other) do you really know that “considerable distortion & misalignment” would not exist in any of these cases?

And I would recommend some meditation on Dave Goulet’s comments-your back pocket is not as securely fastened as you would like to believe.  It is quite remarkable being regularly lectured about how science operates by someone, who himself, is not a scientist.  This is compounded by the fact that all too often these viewpoints are projected in what rings of a condescending tone.  But, what does that really matter?  It speaks for itself, eh?  Let’s get back to the business at hand: Regarding the pig experiment, YC:1. Someone argues that there was a nearby factory that was releasing amines into the air those day.  Can you rule that out?2. Someone argues that just soaking a cloth in Saponin & placing it outdoors face down in the sun at that latitude & longitude on those days causes the same coloration as was observed.  Can you rule that out?3. The pig that was used in that particular experiment (pig #245557) was donated to the lab the prior afternoon, having died from overexposure to toxic levels of ammonia-is that a problem?4. A security guard working the midnight shift reveals that he accidently tripped on the carcass sometime around 2:15 am that final morning.  Being startled, he instinctively reached for his high grade flashlight (a Cobra mega-blaster), and admits that he “might have discharged an intense light beam” onto the cloth, but only for an instant.  “I was scared!”, he said, “I didn’t mean to, okay?”Seriously, when this experiment was first made public on the blog, while bemoaning the lack of controls in the edited version; and acknowledging in Barrie’s defense that one never knows what ends up on the cutting room floor, I also applauded the effort for moving forward in the direction of original research.  The pig experiment wasn’t a great one-it’s somewhere on the scale of a science fair type project, give or take-but as others have acknowledged, even to the points of prudence and overzealousness and all points in between, the effort was there.

But not really relevant to my own point.My point is that the resurrection is beyond physical laws, therefore the image was created in ways beyond our understanding of natural laws.So taking my point a step further, this will mean that if the shroud image was created by the resurrection then we will never no how the image was created because we will never be able to rationalise what or how the resurrection occurred.My belief – and it is only a mere belief! – is that Jesus’s body dematerialized, before rematerializing in  spiritual form before the witnesses – and this is the resurrection. Now in the act of dematerializing, an image was formed on the Shroud. According to my belief, we’ll never be able to explain how this occurred. I don’t buy into the ‘resurrecton radiation” theory for example – it’s an example of trying to apply physical laws to a supernatural event.I realize scientists will find this all most unsatisfactory. And I am more than happy for a naturalistic theory to disprove what I’ve outlined above. It wouldn’t affect my faith.I have no problem with any of that, Matthias. My interest is not in debunking Christian belief, or, more hesitantly, with miraculous accounts of how the “real” burial Shroud came into being. My beef is with the scientists of questionable objectivity (I’m not allowed to call them pseudo-scientists) who either claim that conventional science backs up the Shroud’s authenticity, or who attempt to blend science and magic to explain the Resurrection and image-imprinting as a supernatural flash of radiation, and then rush to their excimer lasers, corona discharge generators, medical X-rays etc etc in search of “supporting evidence”.If it’s any comfort (probably not), I too once wavered towards authenticity when reading the Sunday Times Magazine account of Rolfe’s Silent Witness, late 1970s.

After death, when there is no further renewal of the energy supply and when the integrity of cell membranes is lost, cell walls become freely permeable to potassium ions, and the concentration inside and outside cells tends to equilibrate. In consequence, serum potassium concentration rises from about 3.5 mmol l−1 prior to death to 18 mmol l−1 at 1 h, and 25 mmol l−1 at 24 h after death. Concentrations above approximately 8 mmol l−1 in life are commonly fatal, but clearly the existence of lethal concentrations before death cannot be inferred from finding them post mortem.”It appears that if the blood stains are indeed an exudate, there should be about 7 times as much potassium in them as is found in normal blood, not the vanishingly low amount actually found.

I have always found it interesting that potassium (or the lack thereof) in bloodstains, is referred to as a useful, primary diagnostic-I am not a blood “expert” but have been unable to find references to this in other literature on bloodstains, that is not related to the Shroud.  In communicating with those who know about such forensic tests, potassium was not on the radar.  If common sense and built on such solid scientific underpinnings, why isn’t it routinely tested for in evaluation of dried, aged bloodstains-could it be related to the limit of detection or simply that it’s not a reliable indicator?  If it were, it would be routinely used in the laboratory to investigate the identity of what may be blood soaked into a fabric.

Superficially they’re excellent, but, as I have said, once one begins to probe the details, one is left with more and more difficulties that militate against authenticity (although heaven knows, they don’t necessarily support the forgery hypothesis either). For instance, the ranks of even the most determined authenticitists are split between the “washed” and the “unwashed” (referring to the body, of course, not the people!). Setting aside those who think the shroud is a forgery, or who don’t think the blood is blood at all, I believe that few people doubt that the scourging would have left the body drenched with blood, and that the rivulets of blood down the arms, at least, were made while the body hung on the cross. In order to produce those neat little dumbbells, the body would have had to be washed – but then, why not wash off the rivulets down the arms or on the brows? Or the body was not washed, in which case how did those delicate little patterns extrude themselves through the matted blood over the back? Various semi-scientists have tied themselves in knots attempting to account for this phenomenon, more or less unsuccessfully. They are clot retraction patterns, they are serum exudates, they are haemolytic derivatives and all sorts of odd variations, most of which can explain some aspects of the shroud bloodstains, but fail when applied to others.Here’s a simple experiment. Get a teat pipette of red liquid and attempt to replicate (or produce anything at all resembling) the blood belt, by some kind of natural flow. Most so-called observers have assumed that the blood flowed from the sides and pooled in the middle, when this is clearly not the case.

You can add to that the unevenness of the bleaching of the fibres, suggesting an ancient age for the cloth.Then the only question I think worth pursuing is “What is the process whereby the image was formed from a dead body?”, assuming that a naturalistic explanation is available. Dan commented on Maillard plus “something else” mentioning earthquakes. This I take it is a ref to Giovanna De Liso’s 12 years with seismic experiments in Piedmont. Seismic variations in the geo-magnetic and electric fields, the release of radioactive radon gas, and the presence of iron-bearing rocks all seemed to have had some bearing on the matter, whenever she succeeded in obtaining an image. I know of no other natural process that has come anywhere near obtaining the successful images that she achieved, minor as they may seem. The gospel accounts all refer to seismic activity at the time of the crucifixion, and prior to the resurrection. Whatever the evangelists made of the event, I don’t believe it was intended as a mere literary device.I think it unfortunate, that apart from De Liso’s work that there appears to have been very little follow-through on this aspect of the image-forming process, as it may well provide the key to the answer. It may not attract the attention of scientists in seismic quiescent zones, totally unfamiliar with earthquakes. However, within the “ring of fire” they are all too familiar to us as a common enough occurrence. It may be of interest that the release of radon gas in USA apartment buildings has been implicated as a significant non-tobacco cause of cancer, it is that common! However radon is a chemically inert and invisible gas, and so it is generally unnoticed.Is it a possibility then, that similar images might have been formed on the burial cloths of others during this/different seismic events-undetected because no one ever went back & looked and/or the putrifaction process subsequently erased the evidence in time.

These type of statements make great sound bytes, but how about a few specifics?  Presumptive tests for blood still involve detection of hemoglobin, Fe-bound heme.  Advances have been made to increase sensitivity, but the molecular basis for this type of test is the same.

The oxygenated and deoxygenated forms show different spectral properties, to the eye, fresh (oxygenated) blood  appears bright red, dried (deoxygenated) blood appears more brown, blackish.One explanation might be that a coating on the fabric “locks” the hemoglobin into a conformation that mimiics the oxygenated form.

Human blood is full of carbohydrate complexes and it is also full of proteins, amino acids, fats and metabolites of all of  those. It is a milieu of different substances and substrates which all can produce the reaction of caramelization or else. Given the stress the tortured Man of the Shroud was subjected to one can also assume that the level of plain glucose ( and fructose) in His blood was also very high. Plus the levels of hormones and their metabolites etc.The pH, the electrolyte content was also out of the wack and those factors also can contribute to the possibility of different types of reactions.So why are the researchers singling out ONE ( or two-three) substances for their hypothesis? I’ve seen that already in the “blood threads” and it is continuing here as well.I’ll offer a few my own thoughts, but not sure I quite understand all of this.I believe certain substances tend to be singled out because 1) some data exists regarding their presence or absence-as the Shroud data set is relatively limited, so to speak, that is, in the past, not ongoing, these are the results that exist and the ones that tend to be talked about and 2) people tend to discuss what they are most interested in.  Not sure exactly what is meant by “high levels of plain glucose (and fructose) in HIs blood”.  Not that it couldn’t be high, just wondering where this would fit in.  The Maillard reaction, as I’m sure you know, occurs between an amine group and a reducing sugar (carbohydrate).  Relative to the Shroud, the carbohydrates are believed to be present on the cloth, more specifically on the surface originating from starch residue or one of the glycosides (Saponin products).  It sound as though you are suggesting that the carmelization reaction might be taking place within the blood (high glucose, fructose) and then diffusing out to be deposited on the Shroud?  That it is independent of a direct reaction with the carbohydrates on the cloth?Of course there are many amine-containing compounds in the body, but the discussion typically focuses on volatile substances that are existing/produced at/immediately after the time of death.  I don’t think certain ones are intentionally preferentially excluded relative to others-not really sure what is meant by a”possibility of different types of reactions”-are you referring to other than the Maillard reaction here (that could diffuse out and react with the cloth, resulting in conjugated double bonds?), or the Maillard reaction involving amines + reducing sugars in the blood? Are all of the different substances and substrates in the milleu volatile and would diffuse out similar to those that are typically discussed?   Just trying to understand what you mean.","date":"May 24, 2013 at 9:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/22/struggling-with-naturalist-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Struggling with Naturalist Explanations"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"jesterof :Thank you, Kelly.When a person is under the stress the release of epinephrine leads to subsequent breakdown of the glucose storage – the body uses glucose ( a carbohydrate which can be used in the Maillard reaction) as a fuel and upon stress will use everything availale.So just the high amount of glucose in the blood might serve as a substrate for the Maillard reaction, not necessarily lactate, which will be there, as a result of rhabdomyolysis and tissue hypoxia.Why does the discussion center only on volatile substances created after death is my main objection – all substances available should be taken into consideration, not just postmortem volatile onesanoxie :Precisely, in his point 3, Rogers considered gas diffusion AND direct contact. Different reactants must be considered, limited wound patterns illustrate a contact mechanism.The discussion focuses on gas diffusion because the distant mechanism and its resolution is what gives the image its 3D properties.I agree with both of you in that: all substances available should be considered and both contact and diffusion should be considered.  Here’s the part I would like some help with to understand more fully: the mention of glucose (or fructose) in the blood, or participation of other reducing sugars from bodily fluids in the Maillard reaction -> image formation.This is not meant to be a badgering exercise, would earnestly like to know how this would work.  It is believed that the cloth was bleached, treated with starch paste, then washed in Saponaria, and laid out to dry.  Rogers has suggested this combination resulted in a coating of starch & Saponaria residues on the surface.  I am away from the book right now, but if memory serves correctly, there are 4-6 glycosidic products of Saponaria, none of which are amino-containing sugars.  The soaking, etc. of the cloth leaves a fine coating of carbohydrate residues at the surface, a type of Scotch guard, if you will, or we could call it Shroud guard.The residue hypothesis (Scotch/Shroud guard) has always had a certain appeal to me because, in my thinking, it helps provide a means of uniformity throughout the cloth, for the ventral & dorsal image in the Maillard reaction scenario.  jesterof, you mentioned previously that there is no need for Saponaria at all.  Can you help me to understand how this might work-are you suggesting that the carbohydrate contribution of the Maiilard reaction is not coming from any residue left on the cloth, but rather, from blood components that have soaked into the cloth, and that amino groups from bodily compounds (any you wish to consider, the list can be long) are reacting with these?  Any role at all for starch treatment here?  Where do the glucose/fructose (other reducing sugars) from the body fit in?Can you give me some insight about the free glucose/fructose regarding:How would this work for portions of the cloth that are not in contact with the body?Would such soaking in of products be equivalent/relatively uniform throughout the cloth? Controversial, etc., but if the body had been washed, could this still work? How would this apply to the image being restricted to the superficial portion of the cloth?Would appreciate any thoughts/comments.Thanks for your time","date":"May 25, 2013 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/22/struggling-with-naturalist-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Struggling with Naturalist Explanations"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"daveb of wellington nz :YC is entitled to his views that radon is not part of the solution. However there remains a gaseous diffusion problem in a purely chemical explanation. Clearly there has to be some kind of collimation mechanism on the gaseous particles to produce such a reasonably well-defined image. Radon with its alpha particles, and possibly the subsequent gamma radiation from its decay products, may have been part of that mechanism. They would be fairly small quantities and would not necessarily have a strong penetrating effect on the cloth. The answer might well be revealed in due time, possibly sooner than he imagines. Perhaps YC’s main objection to the possible role of radon, is because it did not occur to his hero. The plain fact is that no-one has ever produced a persuasive image experiment by Maillard alone!daveb,I’d also like to hear more about how the radon idea would work.  Can you help me out with this one?

I also believe the Shroud could have been formed by supernatural means, but I don’t think it had to be.  I don’t know one way or the other-I could see it either way.  So I ask a lot of questions. I’d like to learn more about it.  I try to keep the questions relatively focused. I also am willing to consider the possibility that the Shroud could be a fake.  I don’t think it is, but for me the possibility still exists.  I think it’s a small one, but still there.  Dan Porter has expressed the belief I hold to perfectly: Is the Shroud real?  Probably.There is a lot of talk about what good and honest science is, but it is framed in a very defensive manner-as if anyone who raises questions to deepen their understanding or has an alternative opinion must not be honest or must be biased.  This is telling of someone who themself has a very small and relatively limited comfort zone, and therefore must set everyone else straight.  Good and honest science?  Good and honest science does not mandate that all contrary opinions are, of course, foolish.  The good scientific method?  At the heart of the good scientific method is objectivity.  Trying to view & understand the data from as many angles as possible.  Even first year science students recognize the value of the illustration of blind men describing what an elephant is.

If someone believes differently, consider that they may be at least of limited intelligence, it’s possible that you might learn something.  The  continuous need to proselytize one’s viewpoint at the expense of devaluing all other ideas is a sign of insecurity.

Rogers search hard to find traces of this product but he was never able to suceed”  So, if an alternative method was used to evaluate the carbohydrate profile (using labeled probes, for example), and traces of glycosidic residues (Saponaria products) were found, would this be accepted because it fits the results you’d like to see or dismissed because it wasn’t previously found (even by Rogers)?

The point has been previously raised in the blog that the presence of AB blood on the Shroud could possibly be taken as evidence to indicate that it may not be authentic (as AB blood is a relative newcomer according to this theory).  The D’Adamo theory is at direct odds with the conclusion from most DNA sequencing studies which indicate that the most ancient version of the ABO gene is A.  The next blood type that appears by human lineage is B, followed by O. (see previous discussion on the blog)To apply this to the touch up scenario above, the original blood on the Shroud would be type O (as AB wasn’t around yet), and the later applied touch up would be type AB.

If a single individual (AB) was involved and one clings to the controversial notion that O blood may be the most likely as it is the oldest according to certain theories (discussed in previous threads)-such original blood would not be reactive with anti-A and anti-B antibodies in the original forward typing tests, and thus remain undetected.  Follow up studies using monoclonal antibodies developed against the core O-antigen, however, specifically indicated O antigens were not present in the bloodstained fibers of the Shroud that have been examined.  As anti-A and anti-B reactivity was approximately equivalent, this showed both A and B antigens were present with an assigned phenotype of AB.  This conclusion is from using forward typing methods, (some might argue reverse typing results support this, but as a negative result is expected, this argument becomes somewhat circular).  Molecular biology analysis looking at the genotype (DNA), if feasible, would confirm and extend the forward typing results.  If this were a touchup job, then careful scrutiny of bloodstained fibers on the contact versus the reverse side of the cloth might reveal disparities in blood type, barring divine assistance or a very, very good luck of the draw (see opening sentence above).","date":"April 9, 2013 at 10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/09/an-important-distinction-in-catholic-theology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An important distinction in Catholic theology"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh,It would depend on the type(s), but with mixture of A + B, approximately equal amounts from two different individuals, that would look similar to a single individual with AB.

To be classified as O by reverse typing, this would indicate that both anti-A (could be from either an O or a B individual) and anti-B (could be from either an O or an A individual) antibodies would exist in the serum.  Reverse typing in older samples could be pretty iffy-to provide a reaction they would have to remain functional, which is dependent upon conformation, etc.  They could be present but invisible in such a readout-like a rusted out car on the side of the road-it’s there, but doesn’t work.The previous comment about anti-O refers to the fact that in the early going (mid 70s or so), anti-O reagents really weren’t available.  So, classifying that someone were type O (by forward typing) primarily relied on the failure to react with anti-A and anti-B testing reagents.Since the development of monoclonal antibodies, reagents that react directly with the O group have become available.","date":"April 9, 2013 at 1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/09/an-important-distinction-in-catholic-theology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An important distinction in Catholic theology"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"There is an underlying premise that the Shroud has been pored over scientifically, almost to the point of exhaustion.

I have worked intensively on relic cults and I think that the number of people, especially in a Europe where we have grown up with such things, who believe that the Shroud is authentic are very few. The same goes for any other pre-medieval relic although I have a Roman archaeologist friend who confirmed that one of the several Holy Lances is indeed a Roman lance. So ‘saving the masses from a possible delusion’ is not really an issue because very few are deluded ( or not as the case may be) in the first place. The vast majority of those who believe the Shroud is authentic come from other climes.In medieval times, the Shroud was never an important cult (one of the criticisms of it was that John would have mentioned the images on it in his gospel if they had been there on the original), it becomes one when the Savoys take it over and make it such a central theme of their royal prestige. In this sense its heyday was the seventeenth century when it was exhibited to vast crowds almost every year.I like the Shroud as a subject because, despite it not being seen as important in its day, there are lots of issues surrounding the nature of its  weaves, the actual history itself,the iconography of the Shroud and what it might actually have been if not originally a grave cloth. I am just hankering after some proper tests so that I can have more evidence to work from. So my ‘personal’ interest is as a historian who has specialised in relic cults, and sees some unresolved issues here that interest me. So I keep an eye on these debates and contribute when I feel i have something to offer (as in areas where i would like to see further research). Despite the odd snipe at me from some contributors, I congratulate Dan for keeping things as open as they are.Charles, Thanks.  I don’t think you took my general comments as a veiled snipe, but, if even a little doubt may exist, that was not the purpose.  I was just commenting in general.

But anyway, just thought I’d slip that in there, it’s in the book. I know, I know, an open issue, no problem…”This comment of your really surprises me, Dr. Kearse. I could understand others less scientifically or technically qualified making it, but YOU????Where does one start? How does one start?Let’s just say that one would expect blood that was either 700 years old or 2000 years old to be extensively degraded, and not something that could be so easily identified as the kind of blood that is looked at routinely in modern crime forensics. OK, that’s speculative, maybe, but you surely don’t need me to tell you that Adler and Heller were hard pushed to characterize Shroud blood with standard test procedures. Those field kits only test for the first two stages of degradation as I recall, i.e.as far as hemochromes. But degradation was surely far more extensive, given the difficulty  of getting blood stains, real or look-alike,  into solution, requiring hydrazine and other harsh reagents as I recall, Then there was the atypical porphyrin spectrum, which then occasioned what was largely speculation on their part, i.e. biblical narrative-driven speculation  (spectral shifts attributed with trauma-induced bilirubin  (photo-labile) that some might consider would have been photo-oxidized away within in no time at all),. One might reasonably ask why they did not attempt a chromatographic separation and identification, e.g. by pyrolysis spectrometry.Adler was a porphyrin specialist, I grant you, but you must surely agree that the approach and background of a synthetic organic chemist is entirely different to that of a haematologist  dealing with semi-oxidized but relatively intact haems-  check his Google Scholar for evidence of that.  Best stop here, methinks, and wait for immediate reaction/feedback to my astonishment at the line you have taken.The basic chemical identification of blood based on the presence of a heme group is the same in both cases-that’s what I was referring to, nothing more, than the bottom line.  Field kits, hydrazine solubilized (aged), the initial chemical identification of blood in both contexts is heme/Fe.  Immunological tests measure the primary blood components albumin, Ig, although more current tests include glycophorin, which can distinguish species readily.  It think it gets advertised way too much that Heller & Adler were in way over their heads, not even able to troubleshoot at a first year graduate student level.  The book version may be in narrative style, but such results were accepted & published in the scientific literature.  Surely, the reviewers were much more scientifically & technically qualified than me.   Regarding degradation, etc., of course aged blood is expected to be more degraded than fresh blood, but certain components can and do survive-blood has been identified on prehistoric tools, immunoglobulin has been detected in T. Rex digs, similarly ABO antigens in mummy remains.

(Heller and Gove are the more readable and informative.)Clearly whatever happened to the tapes on the disbandment of STURP they do not seem to have been made over to a public institution that could care for them and make them available for scholars to examine. This is a pity as if they have been kept in pristine condition and together, new tests would certainly add new information about the Shroud.I once worked on a US led archaeological dig in Turkey. We were allowed to take materials out of the country for testing on condition that they were returned.I wish the same had happened here but clearly the deal was done otherwise and so we have a fragmented Shroud. No one here seems to mind much. (One of my first jobs when working as a ‘slave’ – I suppose ‘intern’ nowadays, in Rome, in 1966 was packing away gold fibulae from Etruscan tombs and I was taught how vital conservation and labelling was because one would never know who might one day want to examine the finds.) Even if I was granted access to the tapes I don’t have the expertise to do any new tests so I just made the enquiry as a matter of interest.I do hope the wrangling about the radiocarbon dating can stop – we have passed the 25th anniversary. Even if the tests are declared invalid there is not a scrap of evidence from the tests done by the labs to date the Shroud to the first century so why go on about them, Even a patch, that no one who has examined the Shroud close-up ( e.g Flury-Lemberg) can see. might simply have been a sixteenth century repair of a cloth made two hundred years before.The atmospheric palynologist, Dr. A. Orville Dahl, surveying the Frei tapes, pointed out that no less than 32 of the 57 pollens could only be deposited by insects – rather than blowing in on the wind as Frei suggested. Dr. Dahl put it cautiously when came to the conclusion that the pollen was not ‘due to wind-borne deposition but to human activity of some sort.’  I am not one for conspiracy theories but I admire his restraint!Heller’s book remains as one of my favorites, together with William Meachum’s, title notwithstanding, but I understand.  I would also list anything by Fr. Rinaldi.  The Heller book has some good narratives regarding the blood tests; today’s blood tests still evaluate the same thing-the presence of hemoglobin-bound iron.  Blood really hasn’t changed during the past 30, or even 300, years.   DNA evaluation is now included in the current forensic techniques, but blood testing still involves the same one-two approach described in the book, chemical tests for Hb/Fe, followed by immunological tests-no disrespect intended to anyone, but it really doesn’t require a huge degree of technical skill to chemically analyze for the presence of blood, even that in dried bloodstains-field technicians do it all of the time, so do undergraduate forensic students.  The arguments about Heller & Adler being too technically naive to test for the presence blood are ludicrous-hemoglobin is a porphyrin; Adler was a porphyrin specialist, for crying out loud.  But anyway, just thought I’d slip that in there, it’s in the book.

Why not? Because he’s not au fait with the problems of dealing with the biological milieu of proteins, lipids etc, of learning the little tricks that are needed to break attachments between your target molecule and the surrounding gunk, and then persuading that molecule, once free, to partition into an organic layer from which it can then be pipetted off and spotted straight onto a TLC plate and run against authentic standards.My first years in research were spent having to acquire precisely these kinds of techniques, and had I encountered Alan Adler at coffee, shaking his head over his “ancient blood” problem, I’d have wasted no time in suggesting a certain fix, one I learned from the bile acid literature, and had successfully applied to bilirubin, and not just free relatively apolar bilirubin but its more polar conjugates (mono- and di-glucuronides).What one does is exploit the fact that porphyrins and linear tetrapyrroles that originate from haemoglobin all have two propionic acid side chains that make them negatively charged organic anions, or partially anionic, in physiological buffers around about neutral pH. The trick is this. There’s a cationic surfactant called CTAB, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, i.e. hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, which you may have heard of, since it’s used to extract DNA from chloroplasts and other plant material. You add CTAB, and being cationic, it forms a tight association with you anionic porphyrins etc. You then add chloroform, methanol and buffer in the correct proportions to get two immiscible layers, i.e. a standard Folch extraction, and hey presto your CTAB-porphyrin associations from the aqueous to the organic layer. Take off that lower organic layer, maybe evaporate some surplus solvent with a puff of nitrogen, then as I say, run on TLC with a solvent of intermediate polarity, maybe with a dash of acetic acid to help split the CTAB-porphyrin associations. All you need is a uv lamp to detect the porphyrins as they migrate up the silica gel. You can then take them off with one of those gizmos attached to a vacuum line whose name I have forgotten, and when the removed areas of silica gel have dried you tap out the powder, elute off your purified porphyrins etc for analysis by glc-mass spec or whatever.I and Don Ostrow were using this technology in the early 70s to track the fate of bilirubin in the phototherapy of neonatal jaundice. Alan Wotshisname at the Mayo Centre was doing the same thing to track the fate of bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. Why on earth did STURP not take advice and tips from people dealing with biological material. Why did they recruit a synthetic organic chemist who, smart though he was, very smart by all accounts, was simply ill-equipped to deal with biological gunk?I don’t know, I suppose you’d have to ask them, Adler seemed like a pretty good pick to me.  Approaches are different-here at the US at this time of year, some rake their leaves…some mow…some use a blower…some a vacuum.  I suspect there is even someone, somewhere using tongs.  My hunch is that if you, yourself, had performed the tests with any and all of the above mentioned considerations & techniques, and had those results accepted and published in the scientific literature, there would be those that would take issue with the data.

It’s called hydroxyproline (HP), a breakdown product of collagen and elastin in connective tissue. Given there’s a lot of connective tissue in a leech that may have been extruded  along with semi-digested blood (depleted in potassium and with an anomalous porphyrin spectrum) by our Brother Hirudo, looking for a handy look-alike non-clotting substitute for fresh blood, there’s actually quite a few aspects that could be said to fit a ‘wacky’ leech hypothesis.But jump forward to the late 20th century, where an explosives thermochemist recruited to STURP as Chemical Director detects a hydroxyproline peak on his pyrolysis mass spectrum of Shroud “blood” , and what’s his response? Answer: to assume it’s normal to have HP as a major constituent of human blood (where’s the evidence?) and immediately to seize upon it as a handy way of bolstering a flimsy case against the Shroud image being a scorch, claiming that the heat would have driven off HP (despite it being a relatively-involatile high melting solid which he probably detected via its fragmentation pattern rather than improbably volatile molecular ion).But there’s a long, long new posting that has just gone up on this site that has confirmed my long-held suspicions that anything one says about the hallowed Raymond Rogers and his peculiar blind spots in chemistry will be totally ignored, like my recent dismissal of his claims that thymol makes further radiocarbon dating a waste of time (bless!). I even provided an email address for the American Chemical Society, inviting folk here to get a second (and better-informed) opinion on what I consider to be generic eye wash rather than branded mouth wash. Yet all his outrageous claims that thymol would form chemical bonds with the cellulose of linen have been totally ignored, and his phoney chemistry endorsed as if unchallengeable fact. I am clearly wasting my time here.Anyone who claims (like John Klotz) that I am a poodle barking at Great Danes could do a lot worse than consult Google Scholar, and check my credentials against those of Shroudie Land celebs (enter R.N.Rogers, A.D.Adler, J.H.Heller etc and compare with mine – C.S.Berry).Thank you for the putdown, John Klotz. I had never thought of using Google Scholar to check names instead of topics until you made that poodle remark. I see no further point in being modest about my contributions to biomedical science when there are folk like you on the site, attempting to turn Shroudology into a scientific beauty contest, one in which biggest pair of tits (fake as often as not ) make the biggest impression on the panel of self-appointed judges.Ah, yes, hydroxyproline-I believe that’s been discussed before. I was actually hoping for a journal reference or two with an evaluation of blood, pre-ingestion vs. post-ingestion, particularly showing that the atypical spectrum of maybe blood is recreated by vacationing in the gut of a leech.  Is there data of an anomalous spectrum or just an assumption that the profile would be similar?  I’m just asking.  “Wacky” hypothesis?  I thought it was pretty creative, particularly with the anti-coagulation angle-beats keeping a cage full of vampire bats on hand.  But, the blood is only part of the story-if it’s blood or maybe blood, there is an alternative.  It could be something elseIf the blood tests were so botched, what about the tests to include/exclude the possibility that paints,pigments can account for the “bloodstains”?I believe that 2nd question was posed by an eavesdropper in the coffee room (Heller? McCrone?) listening in to your conversation with Adler.  In his book, Heller states that six tests were performed to evaluate the presence of blood, any one of which would be accepted in a court of law.  He adds that together they were irrefutable.  Sounds like a pretty strong statement.  Apart from the book, their work was scrutinized and peer reviewed by other scientists, some of whom may have even made the club on Google scholar.  Many would consider publishing in such peer reviewed journals as a pretty strong statement.  The question came up because if one considers the tests for the presence of blood as inconclusive, what about the other tests that were done for an alternative?  Should these also be categorized as incompetent, incomplete, etc.?  There are two ways to approach the question.  If it’s not blood, or even maybe blood, then can one definitely say that it is anything else or does it fall under the category of RBD, remains to be determined?  Are there enough results from the tests that were performed & published to make a conclusive statement regarding this inclusion/exclusion of paints, pigments as a possibility?

It depends on how the blood was harvested from leech. If it was done in a way that extruded leech tissue and their  immunological markers, then  the latter wouldhave been initially intact,and any subsequent degradation would be no more or less severe than that of the blood cell markers. So if claims can be made that ABO blood group markers can survive centuries, allowing positive tests for AB etc, then surely the same could be said for leech markers.The problem might be in choosing which leech tissue component to serve as marker, purifying it from a modern leech (hoping there are no species-specific problems) and then raising one’s antibody to it. But this is your area of expertise, not mine, being more inclined to think in terms of physical isolation of molecules, as distinct from tactile recognition by your immune sera with their miniaturized tunnel-vision search-and-destroy robots, they of the limited vocabulary (like “found” v “not found”, exterminate, exterminate  etc ;-).So, back to my more comfortable and better-fitting biochemist’s hat, here’s another suggestion. Given the leech secretes an anticoagulant that prevents ingested blood from clotting, then the fibrinogen of the blood should be intact, and may, just conceivably may, hang around at least for a while (assuming it’s not all strained off to the outside like the watery plasma in which case this idea is a non-starter). So one tests for the presence of fibrinogen in Shroud bloodstains. If the pro-authenticity ideas of Adler and those before him are true, i.e. that what we see is not whole blood, but serum exudates from bloodclots, then there should be no fibrinogen worth speaking of, although there might be FDPs, ie. fibrin degradation products for which there are separate tests.Come to think of it, did Adler et al ever test for FDPs as another authenticity-promoting marker for real blood? I don’t recall any mention of those. Would a synthetic organic chemist/porphyrin specialist have known there are standard test kits available (I used them myself to monitor the health status of rats on a lifespan trial of dietary fibre). But that brings us back to the question of horses for courses…  Adler is so often referred to in Shroudology as a “blood expert”. Not true, at least not in terms of published  work.“Unique” leech antigens was the phrase, this is in reference to potential protests that the make up is similar to our own, and since these are blood meals, you couldn’t just use any-expression would have to include the gut.  It’s not really a claim that AB antigens can survive, they do, though I’m not really sure that’s a direct comparison to the putative leech antigens, one would suspect these (leech) would be protein-based, not carbohydrate based such as the ABO system.  I am always careful to discuss the typing results on the Shroud as type AB as determined by forward typing-In my opinion, a conformation using molecular biology techniques would be an important extension/conformation.Regarding Adler being a “blood expert”, it’s been discussed ad nauseum-hemoglobin is a porphyrin, he was a porphryin expert. One can decide on their own.  These were professional scientists at professional institutions, it’s unfair to paint them out as clueless at the controls of a plane in a steep dive.  Heller & Adler weren’t immunology experts, but they were able to set up & carry out a series of controlled antisera experiments, either through their own proficiency (easily believable to me) or with some consultation (happens all of the time in science as you know).  You chime in on a variety of scientific areas (numerous) in various postings, which according to the Google Scholar club, there may not be a sufficient paper trail.  What is one to make of that?  Look objectively at the data, results, or comments, if it’s sound, it’s sound.  One’s knowledge & experience can extend GS, no?But enough of this bantering about blood or maybe blood-as I previously wrote, assume these blood tests, even though reviewed & accepted in journals by other Google Scholars, were so terribly botched that it’s only a maybe at best.

But I will tell you this. If the author reported tests on sticky-tape fibres sampled from a “bloodstain” (that description being provisional and essentially under scrutiny) I would take umbrage at it being described as a coloured serum-coated fibre. I’d say that description was begging the question with its reference to “serum”, implying that previous interpretations of the “bloodstains” as serum exudates of blood clots were unproven hypotheses. Indeed, those previous assumptions were to some extent undermined by the curious absence of potassium in the stained areas, and by anomalous atypical haem spectra that had been explained away with assumptions about bilirubin being present, again with no convincing evidence that the light-sensitive bilirubin was present.Personally this experienced referee would have sent it back for re-writing.

I went through both with a fine tooth comb, and gradually realized there was so much padding and repetition that the two papers could without much difficulty and no loss of essential content be condensed into one that was just over half the length, and less of a burden on both reader and journal.  Later I got a personal letter of appreciation from the journal’s Editor, thanking me for the hard work and the keen eye.

They were very common in the Middle Ages an, in fact, having the blood ofChrist in liquid rather than dried form was often taken as a mark of authenticity. (The true blood of Christ would never solidify- this was the selling point of the monks at Weingarten in Germany who had the blood that had come out of the side of Christ and was still liquid to prove it -one reason perhaps why the Shroud was never in the top class of blood relics.)  Here were have a case, like that of the blood of St. Januarius in Naples, when the blood only liquefies on special occasions but is able to replicate itself  on a contact relic that then becomes a relic in itself. Not unusual but good to add to the story of the Shroud.I deal with the medieval blood cults in Chapter Nineteen of my Holy Bones, Holy Dust, ‘The Wondrous Blood of Christ’.I have not as yet come across any member of the STURP tomb ( here apparently still active in 1986) who knew anything about medieval relic cults so I wonder how they dealt with the matter. Anyone know who was involved?You could contact the monastery directly or do a little digging if you sincerely want to know-who, what, when-I’m no historian, but I did last year- “STURP tomb”, I’ll pass-the objectivity is obvious; besides, why bother, any tests that were done would be considered incompetent, inconclusive, etc.","date":"November 16, 2013 at 6:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/copy-of-the-shroud-of-turin-in-new-jersey/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Copy of the Shroud of Turin in New Jersey"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Charles Freeman :So what do you think,Kelly, about ancient blood, apparently dried, that comes  damp to such an extent that it can be transferred onto another piece of cloth? It is common enough in medieval Europe to read of such things which is why I feel quite at home with it and don’t think of it in scientific terms at all. But the STURP TEAM (raised no doubt from the TOMB of their disbandment of 1981) apparently did think of it as a ‘scientific’ happening. So if the two bloods are the same,what is the mechanism through which the dried blood of the Shroud transferred itself to the nuns’ copy?What do I think?  I believe in science.  I believe in miracles.  For me, it is not a given that science and faith must be in conflict.  I disagree with those who think this is so.  I also disagree with the promotion of any type of relic as authentic & miraculous when the science says otherwise.  Is it possible that some religious relics are fake and overhyped?  Of course it is.  But I don’t think this automatically disqualifies everything.  This is a subject that has to be considered on an individual basis.  God doesn’t need to rely on fakery.  He’s much, much bigger than that.      A tent of Catholicism is transubstantiation.  I am a Catholic (adult convert).  I believe in it.  If I didn’t, I wouldn’t leave the pew.  What is the mechanism?  I don’t know.  But I believe there is one, though you probably won’t find it looking in a science textbook, even the latest edition.  In my opinion, there’s much about science and natural laws that remain to be elucidated, I don’t think we know everything about everything, even in 2013, soon to be 2014.  A fighter jet or iPhone would have seemed miraculous or the devil’s trickery 500 years ago.  Where do we currently sit on the timeline with our scientific knowledge?  99.999% and counting?  I, myself, think it’s naive to think so-man was made in God’s image, true, but prepare to catch an atomic bomb when you try to take Him on in a chess match.Back to the Shroud copy in NJ.  I’ve been there, I’ve seen it.  If the blood on the Shroud is not real blood, then any discussion is pointless.  If the Shroud blood were the true blood of Jesus, the mechanism could be a miraculous one.  Or, then again, with all due respect, it could just be the humidity.  I have no problem either way. For myself, the most important thing about the Shroud is not if the blood is a specific type or if the bilirubin is high or low, or even if the blood is transferred or applied.  Becoming interested in the immunology & cell biology aspects that surround the Shroud has allowed me to consider the images in a more detailed way than I ever did.  Even if it were a marvelous work of man-made art, I would still value its ability to deepen my faith in the sufferings of Christ.  In my life, the Shroud has done that in a different way than anything else ever did.  I’ve seen the Pieta, I’ve seen numerous paintings & frescos, I’ve seen the Passion on the big screen and on DvD.  The Shroud has made it more real for me.  That’s the bottom line.  That appreciation will still be there, even if it were demonstrated to be bogus by the evening’s end.  Science & faith have together given me a wonderful life.  So, what do I think?  I think you should be careful what you ask for; after all, it was in a “tomb” where this all started.","date":"November 16, 2013 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/15/copy-of-the-shroud-of-turin-in-new-jersey/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Copy of the Shroud of Turin in New Jersey"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh Farey :“the fact that it came into physical contact with the Holy Shroud of Turin.

This is how relic cults work – the myths just develop, as it appears that Zugibe developed this one, and their origins can no longer be traced but if people want to believe that they are miracles they will and the story will go on growing.I am glad that Kelly has told us that he believes in the possibility of miracles because that helps understand his approach.Any event for which one can not find a physical explanation  can  potentially be the result of a miracle. So if, as yet, we have no scientific explanation for the images on the Shroud , Kelly can keep open the possibility that they are the result of some miracle.Hard-nosed Brits like myself, living in a country that simply gathered up all relics and burned them in the 1530s, take another approach – we don’t understand ‘x’ but there are lots of things we didn’t understand in the past, we do understand now as a result of scientific developments, so why not the Shroud?This does not mean that relic cults, the way they arise and grow and why some become worldwide phenomena and others disappear is not a fascinating topic- at least fascinating enough for me to have spent many months researching and writing about it. I repeat that I am delighted that the Shroud has been behaving like a good medieval relic should and transferred itself onto a copy that has now achieved veneration in its own right with a storyline that seems to have been boosted further by Fred Zugibe. What will we be saying about the Shroud in fifty years time or will it be one of those cults that simply disappear like so many others in history?Charles, you may be a gifted writer, but even talent falls short of being able to twist another’s words so far.  My words are what they are.  I wrote them, others can read them, as they can yours.  You asked what I thought, I told you.  I don’t need to grasp for straws to claim a miracle if the science doesn’t fit.  I choose to leave both possibilities open.  I choose to be objective.  There is a difference and you know it.    Hard-nosed?  Want to put a honker to the real test?  Try evaluating from an objective viewpoint, without a preconceived foregone conclusion, working backwards, choosing with delight what supports one’s own ideas.

Clearly if one believes in the possibility of miracles then the lack of any scientific support for a first century date is not so important.Ah, but there you are clearly mistaken that it is not so important, at least in my beliefs.  I do not view it that way. The lack of scientific support for a first century date is very, very important.  It is all important.  I don’t think it’s accurate to equate believing in the possibilities of miracles with discarding scientific evidence, it’s not the same thing.Even if the Shroud is authentic, I believe that image formation could have occurred by a completely naturalistic process-it’s a possibility I leave open.  Just as I do regarding a miraculous one, or some combination in between.  For me, miraculous doesn’t operate by default, if a scientific explanation about a process is incomplete, this may simply reflect the fact that the right set of experiments hasn’t been done yet.

If God worked in terms of proof, why not appear in the sky and be done with it.”Thomas was in the inner circle, yet, for him proof was necessary.  For some, tangible evidence is part of the equation-for some it’s not; for others, it might push them closer than they once were…I don’t know why God doesn’t appear in the sky and be done with it. He doesn’t seem to work that way.  I suspect He has His reasons.It is difficult for me to understand how science could prove the authenticity of the Shroud.  I don’t think that it can.  Science can only take you so far, up to a certain point,-after that faith must come in.  Perhaps it’s the word “prove” that is a sticking point-it may mean different things to different people.  In the realm of science, it’s a strong word to use.Religion is about faith, most certainly, but does this implicitly warrant that science must be quarantined in all matters of religion?  The attraction of the Shroud for many is, it goes without saying, its relationship to faith.  For the believer who is also a scientist, investigation into the physical properties of the Shroud is a natural.  For myself, science & faith are an important part of my identity-together, the two have given me a wonderful life.  I believe that the Shroud once wrapped a human body.  It may or may not have been Jesus.  I think it probably was.  Can science prove this?  It’s very difficult for me to see how.  I am a Christian who is also a scientist.  I am a scientist who is also a Christian.  To me, that isn’t contradictory; a conflict between the two isn’t automatic.  More often than not, I usually agree with myself.      It may be a simplified analogy, and this is not intended to trivialize the subject, but in some ways investigation & discussion of the Shroud may be relatively similar to “proving” an autograph is authentic.  Yes, the looping of the “B” and the slanting of the “R” are right where they should be, that’s important…The ink is consistent with the type of fountain pen that would have been used at that time.  Records indicate that someone named “George Herman” signed into the Hotel Diplomat during the supposed month-actually, there is some discrepancy if it is “Herman” or really “Henmab”-apparently the desk clerk spilled coffee on the middle of that page of the register.  Several cigar stubs (at least one of them was well-chewed, although not sufficiently enough for a dental records match) were reportedly found at a nearby train station.  Could this really be a baseball signed by the Babe, himself?  There are multiple findings that are consistent with the ball being genuine.  It makes sense.  Ol’ grandpa really loved that ball…got it from a friend of his…he kept it on the mantle for years, until it rolled off one afternoon and nearly went into the fireplace…Unless you were there, and handed the ball over to Mr. Ruth, and watched him sign it in person, it is difficult to “prove” that the autograph is real, particularly to anyone else-this becomes further compounded with increasing time.  You weigh the evidence, which is not a standard unit for everyone-opinions will certainly vary-the rest you have to take on faith.","date":"February 16, 2013 at 9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/16/imagining-the-shroud-of-turin-again-and-still-by-mathew-n-schmalz/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Imagining the Shroud of Turin AGAIN, and still by Mathew N. Schmalz"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Images of 6- and 9-week old developing fetuses in the scorch/patch regions…embryogenic body organization evident…couldn’t one also argue it looks like a souvenir keychain from Area 51?

Admittedly, I have not read the five sequential articles you mentioned above.  I did read the paper referenced in the blog.  One of the main issues, which I’m sure you can appreciate, is that the objectivity of pattern recognition is at best, controversial.  This is a different technique than reading a number off of a machine or visualizing a radioactive band on a gel at a specific defined mobility in reference to a standard.  Then again, pathologists are trained to critically observe specific details of tissues to decide if they are diseased or healthy.  So, certainly within one’s own perspective.  In reading the (linked) article, there were figures showing embryonic patterns in scorch/patch areas.  If no such fire had occurred, or the cloth had not been folded as such to create a template for the regularity/symmetry of such burn patterns, this would not be an observation.  Is this really a property of the cloth, per se or just a result (“artifact”) of the cloth’s storage history?  If a parallel cloth had been stored under exactly the same conditions, would the same patterns persist or is the suggestion that this is unique to the Shroud?","date":"October 13, 2013 at 10:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-a-peer-reviewed-scientific-journal/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"In a peer-reviewed scientific journal"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Josie L Tyner :It took me awhile to understand what Dr. Diaz was trying to say.

I understand Dr. Diaz did not have direct access to the Shroud, so how could he examine it for residual EMR? The so-called ‘spectral emission line’, presumably, is the result of electromagnetic activity surrounding the Shroud-but under what conditions? and when? And what equipment was used to analyze this? As I understand it, the SOT is now kept in an airtight case filled with Argon and some other gasses, would this affect Dr. Diaz results? I got as much info as I could at the local library and the internet about images being produced in cancerous tissue, came up with nothing.

Kelly is perfectly correct that all sorts of things “might” have an effect, and Mike may be correct in his ideas of what blood “may” do, or “would” do. The great thing about Garlashelli and Borrini is that they can say what, in their admittedly very limited experiments, it actually did do. I don’t think it is necessary to recreate the exact configuration of the rivulets and islets, just how to produce some kind of interlaced or zigzag flow. No amount of simple physics is a good as a demonstration.And as for a forger making it red – adding red paint would probably do, such as madder root dye. This is much more of a problem for people who think it is undoctored real blood, as we have discussed before. See http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/wiltshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8302000/8302446.stm for Lord Nelson’s bloodstained glove, http://gb.pinterest.com/pin/179862578842010008/ for JF Kennedy’s shirt, http://historical.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=6014&lotIdNo=6169 for Abraham Lincoln’s collar, or http://ornamentedbeing.tumblr.com/image/5318393577 for King Charles I’s shirt.Yes, I applaud the effort to actually do something, but I think these types of situations can only go so far, you get rivulets, you don’t-again, I think the variables in trying to recreate this type of thing can be numerous.  Even for a single individual, on a singular arm, the relaxed & flexed positions of a forearm, shoulder could alter the blood flow patters due to the absence or presence of furrows at a particular time that blood dripped downward.The pictures are interesting-I believe the color of the cloth(s),material including the Shroud, is a consideration to be taken into account as to how this may affect our perception of the blood color.If the blood was doctored, wouldn’t the chemical signature of the additive be apparent in the spectroscopic analysis-or perhaps it could lie within certain of the unresolved peaks?In Adler’s protease digestion experiments, would the paint, dye be sensitive, removed together with the blood to evaluate fiber color underneath?","date":"April 3, 2014 at 10:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/03/more-on-the-y-crucifixion-with-pictures/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on the “Y” Crucifixion with Pictures"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh Farey :The official record of Garlaschelli and Borrini’s presentation can be found at: http://www.aafs.org/sites/default/files/AAFS2014Proceedings.pdf. Three references to the “traditional” horizontal position of the arms led me to believe the setting up of a straw man, but I think I was mistaken. Attempts to get blood to flow down an arm were made from three different ‘exit wound’ sites, at angles from “0° (arm parallel to the groud and perpendicular to the body) to 90° (vertical arm).” It was found that blood would only flow down the arm at “greater than 80°” which is, indeed, a good deal more vertical than any “traditional” position.The idea that there were two blood flow angles, as illustrated above, was explored many years ago. The zigzag pattern was created, it was suggested, by blood flowing vertically down the arm and stopping in minor clots along the way, which, when the arm was more horizontal, then changed direction and dripped straight off. This was quite ingenious, and I experimented with it myself twenty years ago, but was wholly unable to produce anything like the pattern we see on the Shroud. The fact that in all this time nobody has reported success suggests that either the experiment has continuously failed, or that the researches of Garlaschelli and Borrini are long overdue.Mike’s suggestion, that the blood would flow along the sloping arm if the flow was slow, or vertically off it if the flow was faster, also needs experimental corroboration.The authors do state that “further analysis will focus on the position of both arms…” so I don’t think the right arm has been wholly ignored. We must look forward to their further results.I would think the amount of variables that might affect the results would be significant-clean skin versus sweaty, grimy skin, musculature, length of the arms, amount of hair on the wrists, forearms, the frequency, duration of movement, etc.  If three people were crucified on exactly the same style of cross for exactly the same amount of time, their bodies taken down and wrapped in a cloth, how overlapping would the blood flow patterns be?  Would there always be rivulets?  In exactly the same pattern.  Handling, transport of the body could also be affect the final result, as well as washing, even done hurriedly, which is debatable. .

Most of the literature where plant material is concerned is to do with cellulose, and with high temperature treatment (with a view to making semi-synthetic fuel oils).So it’s back to first principles in trying to guess what kind of products one might be dealing with where discoloration of linen is concerned, especially if as seems likely it is  hemicelluloses that are the more susceptible to chemical change.If one were to take as one’s model a fairly mainstream, uncontroversial model, it would be the pyrolysis of xylans to furfural (an aldehyde). First the xylan polymer de-polymerises, releasing free xylose sugar. That then loses three molecules of water to form furfural.C5H10O5 → C5H4O2 + 3 H2OBut there’s a problem. Pure furfural is colourless. However, it does yellow quickly on exposure to air (not surprising, given that aldehydes are reactive, and tend to polymerise etc).  So when they speak of carbohydrate dehydration it may in fact be dehydration plus simultaneous aerial oxidation. That would then account for the ability to bleach the product with diimide – by reversing the secondary oxidation – but presumably leaving the initial dehydration step(s) intact.So what are the products of furfural oxidation that are yellow?From a quick literature search:“A problem associated with the use of furfural, however, is its tendency to oxidize in the presence of atmospheric oxygen to form oxidation products such as furoic acid or formyl acrylic acid or formic acid which further, upon heating, forms furfural acidic polymers.”http://www.google.com/patents/US5332842So where does that leave us? It’s possible that diimide reduction will return us to furfural, or a related aldehyde, and given its volatility, it should not be difficult to detect on glc.  But if the yellow product is a polymer, formed with one or more oxidation steps, then it’s possible that while it could be bleached, it would still remain polymeric, and fail to reveal itself on glc.Answer: Approach the task with a completely open mind. Attempt to spot patterns in the data. Or as an Australian boss of mine used to say: “Just suck it and see”.Colin, Thanks very much for your reply.  I think the use of a panel of specific glycosidases might also help to sort out what products may or may not be present.  Regarding this, might be an interesting experiment to treat image samples (real or simulated) with glycosidases to evaluate which carbohydrate(s), linkages the “image”, coloration was sensitive to.","date":"October 12, 2013 at 11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/10/responding-directly-to-colin-berry/","cat":"science","title":"Responding Directly to Colin Berry"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"colinsberry :Enzymatic action? Glycosidases?  I like the idea in principle, Kelly (me being a biochemist by training) to say nothing of fewer losses as by-products of acid hydrolysis.  But would it be feasible in practice? To reduce a complex heteropolymer such as hemicellulose(s) down to its constituent hexose and pentose sugars on a realistic time scale you would presumably need a cleverly-contrived mix of endo- and exoglycosidases, the first to act at particular links within the polymer chains to effect a quick reduction to smaller more manageable fragments, and then the second, working inwards from the new terminals, to release the individual sugars.Sounds a tall order to me, if you don’t mind my saying.Colin,I don’t mind you saying at all, it could be a tall order-was actually referring to using these in combination with the previously mentioned approach, particularly to help define any species that may be resistant to acid hydrolysis or a more end-stage purification-not necessarily chopping away at the entire structure from the beginning.  Labeled sugar nucleotides used in conjunction with glycosyltransferases to identify particular terminal or individual saccharides might also prove helpful-just a thought-[I myself, used the latter technique years ago in my first postdoc in Gerald Hart’s lab who studied nuclear glycosylation, O-GlcNAc.  I also used this in my own lab to look at trimming & readdition of Glc residues on newly synthesized proteins in the ER-I have photos!].  Plant carbohydrates are certainly more involved, but if there’s a linkage there is a glycosyltransferase to make it & a glycosidase to break it; many of these have now been purified & cloned.

In the first one has sialo-and other glycoproteins that are  cell-surface associated and critical for cell-cell recognition, as well as binding water at the cell surface. Sooner of later those cells die and the detritus has to be digested by endogenous lysosomal enzymes, using those glycosidase enzymes.Otherwise the organism would get clogged up with its own cast-offs.It’s an entirely different situation in plant cells walls. Cellulose provides the fibres for mechanical strength, especially in the secondary cell wall, and hemicelluloses provide a ground substance or cement. The difference is that plants do not recycle their dead and dying cell wall components. After lignification they continue to provide support after death. Finally they drop off, and the only type of organism that can then recycle the carbon are the saprophytic fungi with their invasive feeding hyphae. But fibrous strands, or even hemicelluloses within those strands, are a tough substrate, which is why it can take years or decades even for dead wood and other vegetation finally to disappear. So the enzymes for hemicellulose digestion are not indigenous to the plants that made them, but in an entirely different organism, so are unlikely to show the kind of exquiste selectivity that one might desire if seeking to use, say, purified fungal glycosidases to effect an efficient step-by-step dismantling of hemicelluloses (and let’s not  forget that they they have chains that can have hundreds of sugar residues strung together.).I did a year of botany as subsidiary subject at University (if only because the zoology course was oversubscribed!). Did you do any botany, Kelly?No botany here, I was a bit allergic to anything with a chloroplast-I appreciate the difference in chain length & structure, but if there’s a terminal end you might find a key that fits-very well put discussion by the way.  Many of the saccharides that could constitute a suggested impurity layer at the surface would be amenable to analysis by the aforementioned techniques-I’m not saying it’s there or not-that’s where one of the fundamental issues lies, on which sugars, cloth or cloth-bound does the image reside?","date":"October 13, 2013 at 3:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/10/responding-directly-to-colin-berry/","cat":"science","title":"Responding Directly to Colin Berry"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Very understandable, Dan.

Sorry, I would tell anyone who suggests using lab animals for Shroud research: put yourself in the animal’s place to see how it feels.My main reasoning was to use animals already gone by the wayside.  No blood sacrifices.  No different from a pig used in the tv experiment with Barrie last year.  Just at least, in triplicate, please.  And controls, okay?  Apart from actually involving the body of an animal, I believe there is much one could learn about the process from really scouring the literature and talking to the labs that routinely study the physiological mechanisms associated with death.

Here are two studies I was a part of that characterized antibodies used in the evaluation of human ovarian cancer.  The antibodies recognize tumor specific antigens that are important in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0215(20001215)88:6%3C866::AID-IJC5%3E3.0.CO;2-6/fullhttp://iospress.metapress.com/content/dqmj6wakd35yn153/These antibodies were generated in mice.  They simply cannot be made in tissue culture, they require a living system.  There are strict guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals in such research.  I don’t know about the specifics of cosmetic testing.  In my opinion, one has to weigh the relative cost of using animals in scientific and medical research with the overall benefit towards human beings.  Several of the labs I have worked in were attached to or located within a clinical setting.  Many of the patients there were last chance treatments.  I saw their families in the hallways.  I saw the patients themselves sitting outside in the courtyard, and rode together with them on the elevator.  It was very, very easy to put myself in their place and the place of their family members; the thought of the animals, quite frankly, came secondary or even further down the ladder.","date":"February 25, 2014 at 9:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Louis :Kelly, I get your point, yet I see no need for animal sacrifice in Shroud studies.

This is crucial.  With the Shroud, adjacent white (nonbloodstained) fibers serve this function (no antibody reactivity is observed).  One would also need to show that an irrelevant antibody (of similar type directly against something unrelated) does not react with the host material, that the antibody binding is truly specific.  This is also crucial.  In the Shroud studies, certain secondary antibodies were used as well as anti-O antisera to function as controls (no antibody reactivity was observed). Perhaps such tests were done in the previous studies and not mentioned.  Without such controls, it is difficult to make any solid conclusions about the antibody specificity, i.e. blood type. You would see exactly the same results (type AB) if unrelated, nonspecific were occurring.    Regarding the 1999 result that the sample contained human DNA.  This could also be interpreted as the sample was simply touched by a human being at some point.  To verify that the DNA truly originated from blood cells (and not simply skin cells), one would have to evaluate immune receptor gene rearrangement (unique to white blood cells).  The same is true for the DNA reported on the Shroud.  It remains to be determined if such DNA is truly from blood cells or is simply due to contamination.I am not a pathologist or experienced with examination of tissues, but I was always impressed by the cellular structure apparent in the Lanciano 1971 photographs.","date":"September 23, 2013 at 5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/23/the-eucharistic-miracle-of-buenos-aires/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Eucharistic Miracle of Buenos Aires"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"O.K. :Kelly and others.So far I have read Linoli’s examination had been verified multiple times in 1976 and 1981 (on the other sample taken in 1970) and his 1971 conclusions had been confirmed.The scan of original 1971 Linoli’s paper (in Italian) can be found here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/2j2j8qalrmcrlb4/Lanciano+Article+16-45-35.pdf but I am not sure whether this is legitimate (that means legal) copy.I’ve read the original article, but have never seen the data for 1976 & 1981 confirmations-do you have a link?","date":"September 25, 2013 at 3:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/23/the-eucharistic-miracle-of-buenos-aires/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Eucharistic Miracle of Buenos Aires"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"O.K. :The fragment about Linoli’s determination of blood type as AB is very brief, but it refers to methods developed by some A.

Without controls (run in parallel), it is difficult to say.

Scientifically you can’t claim something is true, just because if it wasn’t, it would have been shown to be false by now.  That’s not science.  These types of arguments lean toward an authentic at all costs approach, not an objective search for the truth. Daveb is correct, there is a lot that remains to be systematically evaluated, grey area on either side of the authenticity arguments, grey area on mechanisms of image formation, and so forth.Too often in cases such as these, arguments based on absence of any “proof” otherwise, the data are overextended to what they really show.  For example, you will read widely that the blood is human blood, that it’s been definitively established-but list the data that definitively shows this.  Adler, to his credit, was appropriately cautious in his conclusions.  Also consider that if any non-human blood components, yes, even non-primate, were (also) present, they would be undetected in the previous experimental designs.  Scientifically, you have to be careful about what they data truly show and where there are potential blind spots.Relatedly, it is commonly stated that portions of 3 genes were found in the bloodstains on the Shroud (betaglobin, X, Y), but the rest of the DNA is really too degraded to be useful.  This is a general misunderstanding of the method that was used-those particular 3 genes were selectively targeted & amplified, like pulling selected letters out of a bowl of alphabet soup-it’s not as though that was all that was found after sifting through all of the dregs that remained.Shroud research is still in the early rounds, the first reel.

She seems to have successfully produced 3-D image of a key and a snake. Some have commented that they are the most successful images produced to date; others have commented that they are only of relatively thin objects. Her paper “Shroud-like image formation during seismic activity” by Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010, may be found at http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf and is well worth reading. Note that the PDF is ‘secured’ so I’m unable to copy and paste extracts here.The most successful images were produced in connection with the seismic release of radon gas in the neighbourhood of iron-bearing gneiss rock formations, with electrostatic discharges and infra-sound emission and with variations in the local geomagnetic field. It seems that the lack of any one of these variables resulted in no image.I have been unable to find out very much about this author, and she has not responded to my enquiries in English. I am given to understand that she may work with Prof Giulio Fanti, and has supported his “corona discharge” hypothesis, so some consider she may be suspect. My own view is that the paper should stand on its own merits. Twelve years of dedicated work resulting in the successful production of 3-D images is not to be ignored.Radon-222 is the longest-lived isotope of radon with a half-life of 3.28 days, emitting alpha particles, and is a decay product of radium. It is prepared synthetically for treatment of cancer, as the daughter product is Bismuth-214 which produces penetrating gamma radiation. In an earthquake the quantities would be very small. However Radon-222 has been implicated as the most significant non-tobacco cause of lung cancer in apartment dwellings in USA.I recall that there have been subsequent papers citing De Liso’s work which you may find on the shroud.com site. The collimation hypothesis is something that requires further investigation, and we shall have to wait for any further information which may possibly come to light in due course.

Well that’s nonsense, as has been demonstrated many times on this blog.One more? Stephen Jones again:“Similarly, if the Shroud were [1st century / 14th century], the science of the 20th-21st century should have discovered that by now. So that absence of proof by modern science that the Shroud is [1st century / 14th century], after 35 plus years of intensive scientific study of the Shroud, is positive proof that the Shroud is  [fake / real]!” [Delete at whim.]We end with the most unreasonable, irrational, merely emotional appeal of all, that the Shroud is scientific proof that Christianity is true. This is literally non-sense.1. I think Walsh’s comment about “no middle ground” is in reference to the fact that ultimately the Shroud is authentic or it is not.  This blog has demonstrated that there are many opinions about many things, but that’s all-in a sense the Shroud is independent of what anyone thinks-t’s either real or it’s not-there is no in-between, while opinions may run the spectrum, swayed (or not)by certain emotional or scientific arguments.2. I think “35 plus years of intensive study” is not the best of phrases to accurate describe this.  It’s not as though large groups of scientists are examining and re-examining the cloth in situ daily.  And again, the notion of proof by default is misguided.  Perhaps that experiment just hasn’t been done yet.  Heller & Adler once said (paraphrased), No amount of experiments can “prove” that the Shroud is authentic, but a single experiment could disprove it.  Science is best at telling us what the Shroud isn’t, not at what it is.3. The strongest proofs that Christianity is true are the transformations and fruits in the lives of individuals who have opened their lives to fellowship with Jesus Christ.  JP II said (paraphrasing) that the most important thing about the cloth is that it connects one in a unique way to the sufferings of Christ.

If it is a powerful argument for yourself (unless and until you have a goodreason for thinking you are deluded), it is not an argument based on a logical reasoning, it is not an argument that can convince even an unbeliever. And muslims or hindus can describe the same kind of fruitful transformations.Look at an argument from history. If we use traditional criteria of historical assessment, we can be pretty sure that the Turin shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. But much more that that, the probability that the image is the consequence of the bodily resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth is very high.An extract of the conclusion of my article published this year in the Heythrop Journal: “As judged by our current knowledge, [the Resurrection Hypothesis] is the most likely of the three hypotheses that have come under scrutiny [Garlaschelli Hypothesis and Natural Hypothesis]. Its level of plausibility is high, which is not the case for the other two hypotheses. Its explanatory scope does not constitute a major obstacle, although its explanatory power could be improved. It is less ad hoc than its rivals and offers the possibility of a substantive illumination on related fields of research. This does not mean, however, that the RH is proven to be historical; it is simply the most likely hypothesis when we adopt a Minimal Facts approach to test for the best explanation.”http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/heyj.12014/abstractOf course point 3 isn’t based on logical reasoning, that’s exactly why I think it could convince certain unbelievers (in Christianity or other faiths).  A changed life is a powerful witness, much more so than hearing someone just recite words or certain facts. That’s the main point I was trying to make, along with that the Shroud can be a part of the Christian faith, certainly, but faith is much bigger than just the cloth.  I am certain that those of other faiths can describe similar fruitful transformations, I personally have no problem with that.","date":"December 22, 2013 at 6:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/22/building-a-house-on-argumentum-ad-ignorantiam/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Building A House on .Argumentum ad Ignorantiam"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"The claims that science has proven the Shroud is an imprint of Christ’s Resurrection or that the Shroud must be authentic because if it weren’t, then it should have been demonstrated as such by now, are a gross exaggeration of the limitations and power of scientific investigation.

Any one of those could potentially be a game changer.  Consider the experience in reaching a consensus conclusion to relatively ” straightforward” questions like, is it really blood?  are the arms the correct length?  where exactly, from entrance to exit, were the hand/wrist wounds?

Regarding other studies, the subsequent connection of MNS antigen expression related to non-human primates was unknown at the time the studies were performed by BB’s group, and their  significance unrealized afterwards until relatively recently.  It’s indicative, but it is important to bear in mind that this is only a single, brief report, not published in a typical peer-reviewed scientific journal).

That’s good enough for me. You can still personally think that there is some missing data to collect before claiming the blood is surely human blood, but I don’t need to wait for this, since I got two experts who analyzed real blood samples from the Shroud and, completely independent of each other, came out with the conclusion that it is real human blood. Again, personally, that’s good enough for me and I don’t need more proof.”You can’t make conclusions about the species of origin of blood by merely analyzing the images of blood and serum stains.  Takes immunology or molecular biology techniques.  Adler was appropriately cautious in his conclusions. So was Garza-Valdes regarding his serological studies concerning species of origin.  99% certainty in a blog rant is not.  Try asking other scientists with a background in immunology/serology, get their opinion.  Especially those who are non-Shroud related.  See what they say.  Key word: cross-reactivity.

Similar to the blood types reported for the Shroud and the Sudarium, the Lanciano host is reported as being type AB.  The primary reference for the Lanciano studies is an article by Dr. Lonoli, published in Italian in Quad Sclavo Diagn. 7, n 3, 1971. (A PDF is available on the web).  It is often mentioned that subsequent studies were conducted on the Lanciano sample by the World Health Organization in 1973, although I have been unsuccessful in finding a reference or any details from these studies.  I am also unaware if any follow up studies to extend and confirm the original findings have been performed-if so, would be interested in a reference.In the Lanciano typing experiments, reactivity of the sample with anti-A and anti-B antibodies is described, resulting in a designation of AB.  This situation is somewhat unique, in that unlike the Shroud, there are no “off areas”, which may be used as negative controls.  In the case of the Shroud, unstained fibers adjacent to bloodstains are suitable, built-in controls to include in the design of such experiments.  As reported for the Shroud, when unstained fibers (even those at the bed of the bloodstains) are mixed with anti-A and anti-B antibodies, no reactivity is observed.  This is important as it demonstrates that anti-A and anti-B reactivity is specific for bloodstained fibers and shows that nonspecific binding of antibodies to the cloth does not occur.  Inclusion of positive and negative controls to verify the specificity of binding is an important (essential) component of such serological studies.  Further typing studies performed on Shroud fibers using monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that bloodstained fibers failed to react with anti-O specific reagents, providing a further control for antibody specificity.  This is significant as the O blood group shares the exact same core carbohydrate structure as A and B blood types.  Only the terminal sugar is different between O, A, and B blood types (see previous postings on AB typing).  Such anti-O specific reagents were not available in the past (1971) and could prove useful in the confirmation and extension of the Lanciano typing results-it would be important to demonstrate the specificity of the typing reagents that were used, i.e. does a nonspecific antibody fail to react (negative control), and do the specific antibodies (anti-A, anti-B) demonstrate selective binding (positive control).","date":"March 12, 2013 at 8:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/10/old-video-ancient-secrets-of-the-bible-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Old Video: Ancient Secrets of the Bible – The Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Pardon for the misspelling of Linoli-appreciate the links; am familiar with the content- was hoping for a reference where the data in the follow up studies could actually be viewed, especially regarding the materials & methods-were the 1981 studies ever formally published?","date":"March 13, 2013 at 12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/10/old-video-ancient-secrets-of-the-bible-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Old Video: Ancient Secrets of the Bible – The Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Matthias :HughI’ve never personally been convinced of the authenticity of ALL the bloodstains.

Everyone expresses 2 forms of the Rh gene, called alleles; they inherit one allele from each parent, which in the case of Rh, are positive (+) and negative (-).  The different forms are written in this format: 1st form/2nd form, with a / separating each form (allele).  If you express at least one + allele, you are Rh positive (positive is dominant); to be Rh negative, you have to express 2 negative alleles, (negative is recessive).  For Rh positive, the possibilities are +/+ and +/-.  For Rh negative, the possibilities are only -/-.  If your parents were both Rh positive and you are Rh negative, that means your parents were both +/-.  They each carried the negative allele, but were themselves positive, because positive is dominant.  The alleles segregate (separate) during reproduction & inheritance, so a +/- parent has an equal chance (50:50) of passing on a + or – allele to a child.  For each child that is born, the odds are still 50:50.  The possible offspring of a +/- father and and +/- mother are: +/+ (Rh positive), +/- (Rh positive), or -/- (Rh negative).When a Rh negative mother has a Rh positive child, her immune system will make antibodies to the Rh protein, because to her the Rh is foreign (her body doesn’t have it).  This predominantly becomes an issue during subsequent pregnancies, because the mother’s immune system is now primed to respond against the Rh-the alarm has been sounded.  Typically, Rhogam is prescribed in such cases; Rhogam is a solution of anti-Rh antibodies, they help to clear the Rh from the circulation, so the mother’s immune system doesn’t respond.A person’s blood type stays with them throughout life, the genes remain, which will result in production of new copies of the (same) protein.  Unless a mutational event occurs  or a person receives a bone marrow transplant (in which case new genes are introduced), a change in Rh expression should not occur. In pregnancy/delivery, certain mistypings may take place, perhaps this is the case here, and not a true change.Regarding the Shroud, although the blood type is sometimes reported as AB positive or AB negative, expression of the Rh factor remains unknown-if interested, there are some additional posts on AB and the Rh factor related to the Shroud-can find using search bar at top right.","date":"March 2, 2013 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Quick note: for the phrase “because the mother’s immune system is now primed to respond against the Rh-the alarm has been sounded.”, this is a dash after Rh, not Rh negative :)","date":"March 2, 2013 at 9:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"In this photo, Stenger has a partial beard (goatee), where does that lead us?

I am not certain what is meant by “no evidence”, but when any article is submitted for consideration to be published (in any peer-reviewed journal, for that matter) it is typically reviewed by (at least) three referees.  In the scientific peer-review system, most manuscripts are submitted to reviewers anonymously (authors’ names omitted) to remove as much personal bias as possible.  Authors may also respectfully request that certain individuals not be considered as potential reviewers due to a conflict of interest, a competitor who might intentionally sabotage a manuscript, for instance.  Of course, in high profile studies, such as these, anonymity becomes rather transparent, as may be the case for those who work in very specialized areas, but the system exists to ensure as best as possible, that review and analysis remains objective and unbiased, that the focus is on the scientific merit of the data, irrespective of the author’s identity.  In a similar manner, comments from the reviewers are returned to the author(s) in an anonymous fashion.  Certainly, many may not be exactly familiar with the specifics of submission and publication in a scientific journal, but to say that “there is no evidence that the manuscript in Nature is peer-reviewed” is unwarranted, without substantial documentation to show otherwise.Even for those not familiar with the particular scientific discipline, it is easy to view an author’s credentials/previous publication record, go to PubMed and type in the last name and first initial.       Any reviewer will know this-the intent of anonymity is remove as much influence of bias as possible-similar to the principles of a “blind study”. Approximately 80% of the NIH budget is devoted to funding of extramural (outside) grants.  A major issue that comes up regularly on grant review panels is do they have the support/facilities necessary to carry this out?  Thus, the location and identity becomes important, which is often supplemented with letters from collaborators.  NIH is currently considering switching to an anonymous grant submission format to more effectively ensure unbiased evaluation of scientific proposals.Relatedly, regarding the objective evaluation of scientific data and opinions on “how real science is done”, I would add that the often-heard cries of religious bias tainting various scientific aspects of the Shroud, appear in their own right, substantially biased.  It is certainly possible to for a professional scientist to separate personal beliefs from the evaluation of data/results, to recognize where and when the line should be drawn.Pierre Barbet, who is often quoted as one of the main contributors to Shroud science said, “It is certain that this Body, in its glorious Resurrection, could leave the shroud with the same ease as when it entered the cenacle januis clausis-“when the doors were shut”.  This final difficulty brings us to what is, humanly speaking, more or less a physical impossibility.  Science at this point can do no more than keep silence, for it is outside its domain.”He would add though, in the next sentence “But the man of learning at least has a glimpse that here is a palpable proof of the Resurrection.”  “Barbet was a man of science and medicine-he was also, obviously, a believer in the Resurrection.  He could accept and recognize the domains of each.  That’s where I think the heart of the issue lies.  Many scientists have personal religious beliefs, favorite books, certain types of movies they like to watch, music they like to listen to-the most intelligent favor the Beatles-favorite foods, etc.  It’s part of what makes them human-at the lab bench, data sheets spread across the desk, it is possible to focus on being objective; many of the scientists I have known will often pull in an unsuspecting grad student or colleague, show them a result and ask them “so, tell me what do you see/think?”  I’m not foolish enough to believe it’s always the case, but it is certainly possible to remain objective when it comes to matters of science that involve artifacts of a religious nature.  It makes sense that the interest of the Shroud for many, including physicians or scientists, is because of their belief/faith in the first place.Okay, well that about does it.

I was searching for a cover photo of the Report book on amazon, when I first became aware of the book.  The US version of amazon lists him as an author.  The UK version lists him as an editor.  I am not sure what Google Scholar says.  The title of editor is even more impressive than author as he is clearly recognized as an authority in the area-the publisher recognizes him as having the knowledge & experience to correctly evaluate the writings of multiple authors in the fieldAs to if he published relatively little of importance in that area, others can decide for themselves","date":"December 1, 2013 at 4:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/01/remembering-shroud-blood-scientist-dr-john-h-hellera-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Remembering Shroud Blood Scientist Dr. John H.

The mineral salts should still be there, come what may, barring laundry cycles(which would have at least partly washed away bloodstains, or the appearance thereof, which is not the case). So while not specific markers, one can still insist they should be there. So where’s the potassium gone?Then there’s that collagen problem. Rogers detected a peak for hydroxyproline (HP) in Shroud blood, and used it (questionably in my view) to support an otherwise shaky thermochemical argument re scorching – or absence thereof. But HP should be a minor constituent of blood, except in some clinical situations like excessive bone resorption that cause breakdown of connective tissue collagen and subsequent release of HP into blood. But we’ve seen the crucifixion- trauma-explains-all-anomalies argument deployed – that it too produced raised blood HP levels by connective tissue breakdown. But collagen, animal collagen that is( boiled bones etc)  is such an obvious additive to expect in any “forgery” scenario that a specific marker (HP) for its presence has to be assessed for cons as well as pros. Not to do so is to risk seeming biased and selective with the evidence.I’m still trying to think of the killer marker for ancient blood that everyone else has so far overlooked. I may be gone a while.Killer marker for ancient blood:  Hemoglobin?  Immunoglobulin?  Serum Albumin? ABO antigens?  If potassium or mineral salts are such a definable marker, why aren’t those typically used in the forensic evaluation of (dried) blood? Losing their immunological specificity?  Antibodies used to detect such products are quite capable of recognizing denatured proteins that may have undergone alterations in their conformation or degradation.  Polyclonal antibodies are especially adept at this as they are a mixture of the products of many different B cell clones.  Such recognition is the basis of Western blotting.Besides, I thought this was all due to Brother Hirudo.

If so, one should be able to get it to migrate on electrophoresis gels, or through gel filtration, and show by use of standards that it’s the real McCoy. I’m not aware of such evidence for intact hemoglobin, are you? So a crucial link in the evidence is missing, is it not, while anticipating the rejoinder that I’m simply asking too much of the Redeemer’s blood.OK, so let’s jump to the far end of the scale, where there’s still an intact free porphyrin, a very stable molecule by all accounts, which is what remains after globin and iron have been stripped out. A porphyrin chemist like Adler would have known precisely how to extract the free porphyrin of ancient blood, if suspecting that Hb was at intermediate states of degradation. So what’s the next step? It’s easy, because I’ve done it, or rather encountered free porphyrins on TLC plates. One needs only traces there to detect them by their intense red fluorescence under uv, so all Adler and Heller needed to do was run Shroud porphyrins against known porphyrin standards (of which Adler at least must have had a library of variants).Tell me this, Kelly. Did you ever read of such a simple straightforward experiment  being done – i.e. to isolate the free porphyrins of Shroud blood, and run them against standards (and maybe do a mass-spec fingerprinting on eluted pigment?). I have not (which is not to say the data are not there, but if that’s the case, then why is it not publicized?). What we see instead are uv/visible spectra of pigments which are the bluntest of instruments in tetrapyrrole chemistry (excluding the Soret band of porphyrins) and when an anomalous spectrum is found for Shroud porphyrin, we see Adler immediately rushing to construct exotic hypotheses based on bilirubin and crucifixion trauma, presupposing a narrative that he and his STURP colleagues were supposed to be testing, not assuming, when instead he should have been doing more experiments, like TLC or GLC-mass spec to identify it chemically.That’s just hemoglobin for starters. Am I allowed to go back to calling it haemoglobin now? Let me do that, and  I’ll promise not to mention my leech hypothesis – at least not in the presence of children.  ;-)Colin,I would agree that additional, different experiments would have been helpful to supplement Adler’s analysis.  I have never felt this was due to Adler being out of his realm of expertise, but doing what he was particularly specialized in, and also considering the fact that the amount of sample was relatively limiting.  If given carte blanche with the forceps following their initial studies, I believe that Adler would have extended his work, including looking into a more detailed characterization and identification of the spectral profile.  However, the Soret band to me seems pretty telling.  I, too, would have liked to have seen more-I once posted on this blog, Ten questions I would ask Alan Adler-but I think you have to put in the context of the time-this wasn’t his own laboratory where the generation of samples was under his control.

As I said earlier, I am only repeating what commentators on the site have said about other Shroud researchers (of all persuasions and  among them perfectly honest ‘sceptics’). Need I trawl back among the posts? When you put them together very few people, especially the sceptics, seem to be of upright character if their opponents are to be believed!  That is the impression that one often gets but as I don’t know any of the characters involved in these attacks I am in no position to know whether they are justified or not. I just know that they divert attention from the evidence. I was standing back from that, and deploring it because personality and the ability to produce valid evidence are not the same thing. I have no idea  whether you have been one of the people who have suffered personal abuse or not. I have certainly been by name and actually got an apology for a libellous comment! McCrone, for one, is not around to do the same. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a new microscopic analysis of the Shroud will side with him rather than with his opponents and in that case his character will be irrelevant.We  have to wait and see.Charles, I initially entered this discussion, because some scientific terms you were using caught my eye. The initial comment I chimed in on was one that mentioned genetics.  I asked you three specific questions regarding what you meant by where the Son of God might fit in genetically, not to stir anything up, not to deplore you view-I was simply to wanting to understand what you were referring to.  No answer.  Then the discussion shifted to blood studies, okay, I’m still in-up to a point.  I respect a skeptical discussion-up to a point.  I don’t believe it’s fair to choose the evidence you like, cafeteria style, while refusing to discuss the whole of it.  No matter how cleverly one can write, when the specifics and details are lacking/selectively omitted, it comes across.  If the Shroud is dated to the first century, and the blood is shown to be human blood, that of a male, type AB (or whatever type one wishes),  bilirubin is detected (at whatever levels one personally desires), and even trace amounts of potassium (eureka!  it’s blood!) are detected…well, then what?  Does it scientifically prove that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus?  I say no. I believe there was a decision/mandate set forth on this blog that insinuations about intellectual dishonesty without proof would not be tolerated.  Referring to anyone specifically or generically as being “evil, insincere, deceitful” and a “crooked lot” in my opinion, certainly falls within this category. These are very strong, very specific words.  I don’t believe they should be used lightly.

Even more sophisticated tests such as DNA analysis are not able to date the blood to a particular time period.  If the DNA is degraded/fragmented (as has been reported for the Shroud), this would be consistent with older blood, but by no means conclusive-there are a number of environmental conditions that can cause the same result in more recent samples.  Regarding where the Son of God fits genetically, is this in reference to the presence of a full complement of chromosomes, including a Y, or a more general comment in terms of ancestry (race),  or “fully human, fully divine” DNA vs. human DNA?   Just curious.BTW, In the latest copy of the Science journal, there is an article with a summary from a recent meeting (Paleoamerican Oddyssey, Oct 16-20), describing the recent DNA analysis of the skeleton of a 24,000 year old Siberian boy-this is the oldest complete genome of a modern human sequenced to date.

Several tests that should have shown up blood failed to do so and this was after all a speciality of a forensic laboratory which is more than anything that Heller and Adler could provide. I am happy to stick to my view that the question of whether there is blood is certainly disputed. As I understand it, the absence of potassium is certainly an indicator that this may not be blood. But I am not an expert, the only expert personally known to me read a range of work including a long article by you Kelly and concluded that there was no clear evidence of human blood. So let’s leave it open.On page 12 of Heller’s book it says, “…Jackson called.  He told me that in 1973 some Italian scientists had taken out a “blood”-covered thread, tested it, and could not obtain a positive result.  But, they added, it was not negative…”  What to make of this?  I, myself, don’t know?  Heller went on to say in the following sentence that it was “double-talk”.     Also consider that Baima Bollone, a pathologist, performed blood studies as well, which surely would have contributed some expertise.  Alder was a porphyrin chemist-this speciality would include the identification of hemoglobin.  Most current standard field tests for blood rely on similar chemical analysis as used by Heller & Adler & immunological tests for further confirmation.  In first exploring the blood data, I consulted with numerous other scientists, many of whom I already knew personally, others whom I did not.  These include colleagues in immunology, blood specialists, and forensic scientists, employed at Yale, Johns Hopkins, the NIH.  I wanted to hear multiple, objective opinions, for me, the more the better.   “No clear evidence of human blood”, could the same be concluded for the counterpart, paint or pigment?  Or that there is positive evidence for such?  I think the evidence is positive that the bloodstains contain blood products.  I am somewhat hesitant to state that there is strong evidence that it is human blood.  For me, primate blood, yes, the evidence is substantial, human blood, it could be better.  The immunologist in me bristles a little bit when the phrase “human” blood is tossed around so cavalierly.  If the phrase “human blood” is going to be used so repeatedly as a solid fact, there needs to be solid, scientific evidence for it.  At the lab bench, the physical characteristics of the blood must be considered apart from the image.So, yes, of course, we can agree to disagree.  I welcome discussion with those who have different viewpoints-otherwise it would be pretty boring.

Rogers did just what Kelly Kearse said, i.e. he was willing to challenge his own image formation hypothesis whenever he could and was not affraid, while he was still seeking for the best explanation, to test the image formation proposals of Jackson, Fanti, Rinaudo, Moran, etc., in order to see if some of those ideas could explain, at least partially, the Shroud image. It’s interesting to note that he came out of all these tests completely empty…And isn’t that interesting also to note that we never heard of Fanti, DiLazzaro, Rinaudo, Moran, Jackson, etc. doing the same thing as Rogers (i.e. doing some lab testing to see if Rogers’ hypothesis could have some chances to explain the Shroud image)?

My comment was directed towards working within one’s own system.  I think you misunderstand what this is about.  Showing that another mechanism is wrong does not prove yours is right.  Or that if another one appears to be true that yours is necessarily false.  It is a scientist’s prerogative to work on whatever he or she wants to.  It has nothing to do with professionalism-your statement regarding “clues” is falsely judgemental of those you list.

He was strongly against teaching creationism in the schools and actively lobbied against it. In one case he wrote a rather strong letter to the editor of the Los Alamos Monitor, the city’s local newspaper.R. N. Rogers10 Jan. 1997The Los Alamos MonitorEditor:Sig Hecker is the director of the most famous laboratory in the world, certainly the laboratory that has had the largest effect on humanity’s perception of science since the beginning of recorded history. This is The Laboratory that has shown people that they must take the effects of science seriously. It is also one of the laboratories that could teach the world just what science is and what they can expect from it. I have reason to believe that Sig Hecker is an exceedingly poor choice to represent science.The public largely does not understand exactly what science is, and there appears to he a strong desire not to be compelled to find out either in school or by personal study. A significant fraction of the public has a deep hate for what they think science is. Another fraction feels that its beliefs are threatened. Both groups have launched assaults on science, and the people who love science cannot believe that it is happening. It is! We have seen a very practical result in the State Board of Education that will have long-term effects.Science is not “things.” It is a way of thinking. Classical Scientific Method is simply a method for objectively applying logic to the solution of problems. 1) The problem must be stated in clear terms, and obscure words must be defined clearly. The goal sought must also be stated clearly. 2) Everything known about the problem must be studied, and all references must be acknowledged. There must be no “hidden facts,” and it is not clever to “blind side” the opposition. Carefully planned observations should be made. Different methods of observation should be made when possible, and results must be checked for internal consistency and agreement with reported results. All observations must be taken seriously, until some justifiable and clearly stated reason can be found to eliminate any. 3) A “brainstorming” session, preferably with other workers familiar with the problem, should try to develop as many potential explanations (hypotheses) as possible (Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses), All hypotheses must be clearly stated. And 4), all of the hypotheses must be tested equally against the same, complete list of observations and facts. Testing may often involve making predictions on the basis of the hypotheses and testing the predictions by experiment. The Principle of Parsimony (Occam’s Razor) states that the hypothesis that includes the largest number of facts and observations will be closest to the truth. Hypotheses that do not accept many facts without “special pleading” should be discarded.We are now living in a time when the special pleadings have assumed more importance than the facts. An approach that does not include the components of Scientific Method is not “science.”A well-tested hypothesis, for which no exceptions have been found, is called a “theory.” The word “theory” in science does not connote “speculation.” Creationists misuse the term to confuse the public.I asked Sig Hecker for help in the defense of science. He has, after all, espoused excellence in science” as his fundamental desire for the laboratory. With regard to creationism, his response was the following: “The lab has no official position on creationism. The media have tried, several times to get me to take a stance, and I have refused.”I suppose that a large government-financed scientific organization must be politically correct. It might not be good for the careers of scientific managers to propose an official position on something like science. An individual scientist, however, might be expected to make continual application of classical Scientific Method. He would be expected to keep “truth” as his primary goal. He would be expected to defend his methods under peer review. I believe that Sig’s refusal to make a personal statement on creationism is his scientific position.If the laboratory is managed by creationists who still profess to be scientists, they should be willing to present all of their facts for public scrutiny. If they are not willing to do this, I believe that higher authorities should return the laboratory to scientific management as quickly as legally possible. Persons who value science should insist on it.R. N. RogersHere is another letter. Any questions now about where Rogers stands?R. N. Rogers17 Jan. 1997The Los Alamos MonitorEditor:John Baumgardner’s response to my letter attributes statements to me that I did not make. I was advocating classical scientific method as the best approach to the solution of problems. I did not advocate or even mention atheism. I did not advocate any control over religious expression. Religion is “revealed”: The body of knowledge in science is developed by application of a specific logical process. The two operate in different spheres. Science and atheism are two different things. Trouble comes when a person attempts selectively to accept or deny scientific observations primarily on the basis of religious beliefs. By definition, a “scientist” is a person who uses scientific method. Like Caesar’s wife, a scientist must be above suspicion. The more “renowned” the scientist, the more careful he should be.I was accused of proposing atheism as official policy for the laboratory. I was accused of advocating control over free religious expression. Those are serious accusations. I did neither.The Greeks classified logical fallacies over two thousand years ago, and many fallacies appear in attempts to circumvent honest application of scientific method on any topic. Baumgardner’s accusations against me are a good example of an argument ad hominum, with which you attack a person rather thrums logic (common in politics). Invocation of great theist scientists seems to have as its unstated conclusion that “therefore, creationism is true.” True science should not use hidden premises; however, the type of argument used involves the non sequitur fallacy (argumentative leap). The most common fallacy I see used is “begging the question”: The argument assumes as true what it needs to prove.Hundreds of years of observations and measurements by thousands of scientists have provided the basis for the scientific theory of evolution. Has all of that been a conspiracy? Back to begging the question, can anyone prove that “science has falsified evolution” without first accepting the premise that God created everything, most things, some things, or (fill in the blanks)? In science you state your hypotheses and premises, and I have yet to see all of the creationist premises and/or hypotheses clearly stated.Incidentally, I hated to use the word “theory.” Its use by creationists illustrates another fallacy, the fallacy of equivocation. This involves the deliberate use of the same word or phrase in more than one sense. A scientific theory is more solidly established than a hypothesis. The theory of evolution has seen an amazing process of accretion of facts since it was first proposed, and it has proved to have predictive value.The fallacy of composition has often been used in attempts to disprove evolution. It involves the suggestion of some doubt and the application of that doubt to the attempted destruction of an entire body of knowledge. Each doubt must be critically analyzed, and I do not see that being done. Is it necessary to disprove anything to prove God? Do warped logic and outright lies support God?I admit that I have not read Behe’s book. I have, however, had a son who worked in Melvin Calvin’s laboratory at Berkeley, and I have read many of Calvin’s works. Calvin wrote Chemical Evolution, and he got a Nobel Prize. I have not seen any creationist work of similar stature. Perhaps a corporate philosophy that allows a lack of scientific rigor explains the lack of Nobel Prizes at Los Alamos.I would have to see some scientific analysis of creationists’ claims, made by creationists with rigorous methods, before I organized a symposium with them. I do not enjoy illogical polemics and vague claims. With or without scientific, method, I suggest most strongly that John Baumgardner watch very closely what he says or writes about any scientistR.

RogersDan,Thanks for your effort on this-It was interesting to read Rogers’ viewpoint in detail.I must be honest and apologize-I was actually making a sarcastic comment, that if Rogers’ assigned some value to evolution (I had a pretty good idea what his views were), then his credibility in studying the Shroud must also be questioned, according to the SEJ school of thinking.

I liked that the balance of the interview was shifted towards de Wesselow’s personal belief that the Shroud is real & what convinced him of this, rather than trying to overly sell his views on the (absence of the) Resurrection. Regarding Charlie Rose’s comment about the current pope’s viewpoint being different than his predecessor, I believe that both BXVI & JP2 were convinced that the Shroud is authentic.  BXVI has called the Shroud “An icon written in blood” and JP2 spoke that “The Shroud is an image of God’s love as well as of human sin.  The imprint left by the tortured body of the Crucified One, which attests to the tremendous human capacity for causing pain and death to one’s fellow man, stands as an icon of the suffering of the innocent in every age”  The position of the Catholic Church has always stopped short of declaring the Shroud authentic, but rather states that the Shroud is an object worthy of veneration, that is an object worthy of love & honor.I am about 2/3 of the way through de Wesselow’s book.  No comment on the first portion, but  the middle section dealing with the evidence for the Shroud being authentic is a pretty thorough, well-presented overview.

There is no “failure” to fully disclose here and this is a completely separate issue from whether one considers the science to be lousy or not.  “Failing to fully disclose” is a straw man, it’s in print, it’s a matter of record-it’s not as though someone discovered a hidden file chock full of secrets.

The arguments about the DSS and JTB are anecdotal.  Far too many unknown variables here, only takes one or two to add a potential monkey wrench into such a comparison.  Scientifically, you would have to split the artifacts into at least two, place them in & outside of caves, in & out of the quake zone, and compare after the big one hit.  There’s also the matter of variable distance(s) from radiation source, quake shake, etc. in any type of comparison.

I have rarely found the STURP scientists wrong, but from time to time their evidence is contradictory, and I have wished they could be consulted in order to disentangle the confusion.

However I was never a professional researcher and have never published anything in a science journal. Being a teacher of general science for 40 years has given me an interest in, and a certain experience of, just about every aspect of the subject, and since I took my degree in the old days of the Open University, when it took six years, I could pick and choose any topics I found interesting, including Geology, Oceanography, Physiological Psychology, Evolution, Ecology and various more general ones like Biology, Technology and Organic Chemistry. My final year was spent on biological statistics! I’ve also taught History and have a passion for emphasising primary sources – I think that may be part of my scientific make-up as well.I have, I think, practically all the STURP papers, and, which appears almost unheard of, I’ve read them. There are some surprising errors (Bill Mottern’s X-ray team thought the Holland backing cloth was made of cotton, for example), but on the whole they are a model of scientific diffidence, and clearly say where their conclusions were tentative and where further investigation should be encouraged. There is no doubt that Rogers’s much later surface contamination hypothesis is distinctly at variance with earlier findings, and leads to contradictory conclusions in some cases, that the blood spectra are far from definitive and that the whole cotton business is a muddle, but that’s all part of the fun.And as for the pollen….Obloquy… good word, isn’t it!Hugh,Thanks-enjoyed reading this.","date":"February 17, 2014 at 4:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/16/the-shroud-of-turin-story-brings-up-all-the-usual-issues-about-click-bait-journalism/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Shroud of Turin story brings up all the usual issues about click-bait journalism"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Hugh Farey :Oh I couldn’t agree more. Experts! But actually I don’t refer to a ‘scientific community,’ because I don’t think there is one. I sometimes refer to ‘scientific consensus,’ but even therewe must be careful. “Most scientists think…..” is often a very subjective judgement based on ones own research partners and a quick flick through Google. This is where a forum like this is so important. A senior academic and Editor-in-Chief of a respected journal might well be regarded as an expert, while a middle school science teacher might not. However, if the science teacher can demonstrate the invalidity of the academic’s work, then the tables turn.Real experts, in this context, are essentially compendia of experiences and resources, which they can use to demonstrate the value of their opinion. If they don’t do that, but rely on their authority alone, then their opinion is no more valid than anybody else’s.You’re right that “properly assessed” was rather an imprecise term. “Universally assessed” might have been better. Some will go for the “he’s a famous scientist so he must be right” angle, some for the “he disagrees with me so he must be wrong” angle (both held by several commenters here), and a few who will look more carefully at the data and references. Eventually, I trust, the truth will out.“Properly”, ah yes that was the kicker…Being a famous or a respected scientist carries a certain amount of clout for certain, but if the data sucks, it sucks.  Typically one’s competitors will make sure everyone is aware of this and will come bearing elephant guns.A middle school science teacher demonstrating the invalidity of an academic’s work-sure, it can happen, but I do think you have to be careful that it’s not just slaps on the back from those in your group-there is a significant difference between posting on a blog and putting an idea in the professional arena.  Not a put down-If the science is sound, the truth as you say will out.  A personal question, if you don’t mind me asking-what exactly is your own background, were you ever involved in any type of independent research, before becoming a science head (at a preparatory school, I believe)?  Start to work on a graduate degree at some point?  If so, what area(s) did you work on?  Have you ever published in a science journal on your work?

Recently we have thoroughly examined David Roemer’s ideas, and a little while agohad another look at the significance of the Quad Mosaic photographs. I think that a rather disturbing proportion of accepted wisdom, even accepted scientific wisdom, let alone esoteric speculation, and not just about the Shroud, is based on insufficiently scrutinised research, which only when it is brought out into the light of the internet, can be properly assessed in detail.But in whom does one trust?  “Properly assessed” by whom?  The internet is full of “experts”, loaded with them-Macgyvers in lab coats, “experts” in all scientific disciplines-how often in such cases do you hear someone simply say, “I don’t know”.  I’m sorry, but being able to use scientific vocabulary does not make one a scientist.  There’s more to it than that.  if such comments are perceived as somewhat arrogant-flip the coin over-how does it work on the reverse side-when others decide to “properly assess” a topic, even though their personal experience may be limited to nonexistent?

We experience this earth from birth to death, for a very finite time; consider this relative to God who has always been.  It is beyond apples & oranges.

I’ve read that there is some debate as to whether the clots were wet/gel-like when they first touched the cloth and/or if the clots were disturbed (by washing the body), causing them to be freshly opened, allowing blood to seep out for a more defined imprint.  I believe the window is somewhere within a 2 hour time frame-Lavoie’s work, if I recall correctly.2. I’m not so sure you can go from the imprints of the cloth to a collapse.  I would think there would be some sticking if the cloth was simply removed from the body, and some tearing away or distortion of the wounds.  Their regular outline would suggest something different is involved here, but I don’t really know how far you could take it.3. I haven’t noticed that type of condition on the Sudarium, interesting idea.  With the issuing forth of edema fluid from the mouth & nostrils & also contribution of perspiration, it might dampen the cloth so that not much sticking might occur-difficult to say-interesting thought.Again, I think Svensson & Lavoie (trained physicians) could probably provide a much more educated answer than me.”I think that is a more correct reflection of what I said.

Though I’d like to see some forensics experts support the conclusions mentioned in the post.I would like to add a few comments, though I am not a forensic expert. I do not consider myself a “blood expert” or a “DNA expert”, either.  I do have a working knowledge and professional experience with the methodology and scientific principles.  I have also taught the subjects at the graduate, medical, undergraduate, and high school levels.  I think the word “expert” is way overused.  It implies a certain infallibility that I, myself, am not comfortable with.  That being said, I think I have something to add relevant to the topic that may be beneficial (or not).  If truly interested in the subject, I would recommend independent validation from multiple sources.Interesting that the premise that real blood exists on the Tunic isn’t protested with a similar vigor as that on the Shroud.  Even though AB is the most infrequent blood type in the population and percentage variations exist among certain ethnic groups, having the same blood type is only suggestive evidence, at best.  These results are consistent with the idea that the blood on the two objects could have come from the same individual, but that’s as far as it goes (or that the collagen binder could come from the same animal, if you want to go really far).  Typing tests are most conclusive at ruling out the relationship between two objects (i.e., when both show different blood types), than ruling them in.The most effective test(s) that could be done to determine the relationship between these two objects is DNA analysis (nuclear and/or mitochondrial).  This is the most conclusive set of experiments that would help include or exclude that the blood on the two objects is from the same individual.  Finally, it is often mentioned that the DNA on the Shroud is degraded; true, but it is also relevant that portions of 3 genes were cloned and sequenced: a subunit of hemoglobin, and genes located on X & Y chromosomes.  It’s been concluded from these studies that the blood is that of a human male.  However, it’s not as though portions of these 3 genes might exist and everything else is wasted.  It could be, but there is no reason to think that portions/segments of certain other genes or noncoding sequences might similarly exist.  These 3 particular genes were able to be analyzed because they were targeted with specific probes that allowed them to be selectively amplified and examined.  This is similar to using a large magnet to pull certain needles out of a haystack. Or, if possible, to apply a word search engine to a pile of shredded documents and asking it to find certain key phrases; many other things may be in there, they are just not the object of that particular analysis.Even with a small percentage of the entire genome remaining intact, who knows?  If additional, more sophisticated DNA testing could reveal useful information is an if.  Contamination could be a issue-it might be possible to selectively minimize it.  DNA degradation could be a roadblock for certain nuclear genes, because of its relatively higher abundance, analysis of mitochondrial DNA might prove more useful-this was introduced into the US legal system in 1985.

The distribution of blood types is as follow:0 type -44 %A type -35%B type -16 %AB type -5 %So the odds  that by pure chance, all the relics would have the same blood type (no matter which)  are like 4:73But next step is that we determined on one of these relics blood type as AB (chronologically it was first on Lanciano, but it doesn’t matter).So next question arises: what are the odds that on the 3 other relics the blood type is AB?The answer is obviously:1:8000All the relics have the same blood type and the rarest in the whole human population!I do see the point-scientifically though it is still only suggestive at best.  It does not show it is from the same person.  I am unsure about the results from Lanciano based on the results I’ve seen.  Some, including Zugibe have raised doubts regarding the AB blood type because of contamination by bacteria, fungi, etc.  Such antigens are shared by those organisms-I have addressed this in my previous articles.  When discussing the blood type on the Shroud, I am always careful to say it is type AB as determined by forward typing methods.  In a blood bank, a transfusion is only performed if the blood type can be cross-checked by an alternative complementary method (typically reverse typing).  In the case of AB, particularly with older blood, this is somewhat of a catch-22-see previous articles).  Molecular (genetic) testing can circumvent such issues, provided sufficient DNA is intact at that region to evaluate.I am familar with percentages of frequency of expression, even if the answer was 1:80,000-if 4 items were brought into a courtroom, which were thought to be linked to the same person, and all showed type AB blood, would this prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the same person?

Those are items, which are claimed to contain a blood of a certain person, that is Jesus.And this assertion may be right, or may be wrong.I agree, from the other side, lady luck would have to smile pretty broadly…but, scientifically, it still falls under circumstantial.  I am pretty comfortable accepting the typing results on the Shroud studies because of the inclusion of specific and nonspecific controls, and the use of both polyclonal & monoclonal antibodies, in different studies.  In the Miracle of Lanciano results I have seen, there is only the presentation of reactivity with anti-A and anti-B antiserum, no control data is presented.  Which specific controls to include are not always intuitively obvious to those who don’t work with antibodies on a regular basis.  I remember as a young graduate student getting very excited about isolating several proteins based on their reactivity with specific antibodies.  The label on the tube said the antibody was specific for them, so I had no reason to question it.  When I went back and ran several irrelevant, unrelated antibodies, I saw exactly the same pattern.  So much for specificity in those particular experiments. I have reviewed numerous papers over the years where the controls on specificity were assumed, but not proven.  In immunology, it’s a must.  From the other side, Zugibe might have argued that the presence of AB antigens on all of these relics was really due to contamination by other organisms.  (He mentioned this in his book).  These carbohydrates are not unique to red blood cells but are expressed in other microorganisms.  I don’t think this is the case for the Shroud because adjacent white fibers are non-reactive with anti-A and anti-B.  Shroud fibers have also been examined with anti-O reagents and shown to be negative.  (The O antigens are the branch from which the A and B are assembled-if simple contamination, I would think there might be reactivity here as well).  I don’t know if the typing on the other relics is as thorough.  I would like to see the actual data.  If it were totally air tight, I would still be at the same place: certainly consistent with, but I don’t think you can definitely conclude anything unless the blood types are different.","date":"November 7, 2013 at 6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"O.K. :Kelly Kearse :Thanks-are they are specific details as to which markers and if multiple forms (>2 for each gene) were present?I will send you the scans from Le linceul de Turin et la tunique d’Argenteuil, but unfortuantely not until tomorrow.Great-I appreciate this very much","date":"November 7, 2013 at 6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"O.K. :No, something much more intereesting… ;-)Ask Joe, let he quote that!OK!","date":"November 7, 2013 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/of-similarities-the-tunic-of-argenteuil-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"Of Similarities:  The Tunic of Argenteuil and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"jmarino240 :O.K. had mentioned a passage on pg. 191 concerning the blood.  Here it  is:   Numerous red blood cells were discovered on the cloth, attached to the   fabric’s fibers.  Besides this,traces of urea–a constituent element of   perspiration–were found among the many groups of red blood cells.   According to  Lucotte, this points to a rare condition, known as hematidrosis, in  which  one sweats blood. The source of this condition is an extreme level of   stress, which causes the organism to go into histaminic shock.

The FBI in the US utilizes a panel of 13 of these markers (plus the amelogenin genes for X & Y chromosomes) as part of their standard DNA analysis.  It would be interesting to see sampling from several sites (on the Tunic) and compare the profile-this would speak to the heterogeneity that may or may not be present.

We sent blood flecks to the laboratory devoted to the study of ancient blood at the State University of New York. None of these claims could be confirmed. […] It is almost certain that the blood spots are blood, but no definitive statements can be made about its nature or provenience, i.e., whether it is male and from the Near East.and further about aloe and myrrh: Biblical accounts suggested several types of compounds that might have appeared on the cloth (e.g., aloes, myrrh, sebaceous secretions, etc.). We planned and executed chemical analytical methods that could detect them in 1978. Those methods were extremely sensitive, but they did not detect squalene or myrrh. These results could have been confirmed by additional tests on the Shroud, but the “restoration” has totally changed the Shroud’s surface.May I ask: was Rogers even aware about Baima-Bollone’s existence?And what about insinuations in the style of: A suspicious person might wonder whether the “restoration” was rushed through to prevent ethical work on confirming both chemical and pollen observations.

Regarding the multiple use of the word “claim”, I don’t pretend to speak for anyone else, but this may refer to the fact that neither the typing studies nor any DNA results (as far as I am aware) have ever been published in a formal, peer-reviewed journal.  This is a difference between much of STURP’s findings and those in discussion.  One could argue that STURP’s findings were more mainstream in the scientific community.  I don’t personally believe this automatically devalues the results of anyone else (non-STURP or otherwise), but consider this from the view of bench top scientists in the non-Shroud world, outside looking in.

So we have good circumstantial evidence of an original gesso. A further close-up examination is needed.”“Large quantities of calcium carbonate” Is there a value given for what large is concerning the calcium carbonate in STURP’s their analysis, exactly which reference(s) contain this? In the 1980 paper by Morris, Schwalbe, and London, in X-ray spectrometry, measurements for calcium, iron, and strontium are shown.  They comment “both calcium and strontium are relatively common elements.  For instance we might expect considerable quantities of airborne CaCO3 [calcium carbonate] from the rich marble and limestone regions of northern Italy…Although other explanations are possible, the uniform calcium and strontium distributions might be explained simply as dust accumulations.” Are they other references from STURP that specifically designate large (any) values of calcium carbonate or is this restricted to calcium?Are the STURP findings/conclusions specifically linked to calcium carbonate or just calcium?(see below)In Adler’s “orphaned manuscript”, Chemical and physical aspects of the Sindonic images, published in 2000, it says “All the types of Shroud fibers gave positive tests for only two elements, calcium and iron.  However, these elements do not derive from the presence of iron oxides or calcium carbonates in the fibers…”Relatedly, In Heller and Adler’s 1981 paper, in Canadian Society of Forensics Science Journal, in discussing the process of converting flax to linen, retting, it says, “During this process the natural ion exchange properties of cellulose operate and two ions found commonly in natural waters that most strongly bind in this way are Ca and Fe, with the former being more strongly bound, as reflected in the relative concentrations seen in the X-ray and present studies.”  Ions reflect free calcium (Ca2+) which could be totally unrelated to the presence of calcium carbonate.  In their studies, similar elevated levels of Fe and Ca were reported for older (Spanish, Coptic, and Pharaonic) linens as wellIf the high calcium levels are due to gesso, why is the accompanying protein signal lacking?A valid theory cannot simply discard what does not conveniently agree.

Cellulose is not an ion-exchanger, having no electrically-charged groups. Its use as a chromatography solid support depends on physical adsorption, not ion exchange. As put to Charles late last year (no reply!) the association between linen and calcium probably depends mainly on the pectin content (negative uronic acid-derived anions) and that is weakened as a result of retting, given the latter results in extensive microbial digestion of the middle lamellar pectins.Charles is simply not entitled to equate calcium with calcium carbonate unless he can supply HARD evidence to back up that view.

It says, “Low was also supportive of the credibility of Alan Adler’s explanation for the “too red” blood.  He himself had come across 300,000-year-old blood of a similarly vivid colour, it always being the circumstances of the deceased’s death, rather than anything to do with the sample’s age, that is responsible for this.”  Also on pg. 235, “Quite aside from Dr. Alan Adler’s argument, we have heard ancient blood specialist Dr. Thomas Loy confirm that blood many thousands of years old can remain bright red in certain cases of traumatic death” I tried to contact Dr. Loy several years ago to follow up on this and learned that he was deceased.  David Mo mentions outdated scientific methods (hence we shouldn’t believe any such results in the “modern age”, some thirty years later).  Exactly which specific scientific methods are no longer warranted/useful?The blood color question is an interesting one.  As you know, various explanations have been put forth: bilirubin, CO, saponaria, paint, etc.  Totally my own opinion, but I don’t believe the answer lies (solely) in any of the above.  Regarding bilirubin, it’s quite unstable-I would like to see more evidence for this, particularly quantitative-in the Adler studies it is essentially qualitative.  I am similarly uncertain about saponaria-fine if its hemolytic, but once the cells are lysed, what prevents the hemoglobin from oxidizing to a brownish/blackish color over time?  Is there any evidence that the Shroud contains a saponaria coating?  The carbon monoxide hypothesis, originally proposed by Baima Bollone is problematic in that it is expected CO would exchange out with oxygen over time.  The spectral data from the Shroud studies is not in agreement with the CO-bound form of hemoglobin.  For anyone seriously interested in the question of blood color and the Shroud, I would recommend looking at the 2014 article by van der Hoeven-it offers an alternative consideration from the cloth side of things-it’s not for the faint of heart, over 200 pages, several inches thick.  I’ve read it through once, but want to go back through and reread it more carefully.  The paper contains some original experimentation, which is thoroughly explained.  In my opinion, when the blood problem is considered, the possibility that more than one factor could be at play has to be taken into account.Regarding other additional experimentation for some of things you mentioned , Goldini reported that normal blood (with non-elevated bilirubin levels) turned red following exposure to uv light.  How long this remains (over time) is unclear.  I, myself, have experimented with saponaria-treated cloth (modern linen), extracted under various conditions-I found no difference between saponaria and untreated cloth.","date":"January 12, 2015 at 3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"Louis wrote:“Kelly Very many thanks for taking the trouble to provide such a detailed explanation.

The decay of the images is symbolised by the contrast between the enormous crowds able to see the images in the seventeenth century and the close-up viewing needed today. As you may know one of my points is that we should be asking what the images were when the Shroud was originally created, not what they are now – this is the biggest wild goose chase of them all. We need to shift the whole focus of Shroud research and work on the depictions and descriptions from earlier times as one would normally with any artefact of this nature. (Why is the Shroud outside the normal approach to ancient objects?) Part of the circumstantial evidence is the examination of the Heller -Adler papers by a professor of physiology who is not convinced by them and thinks that some of the findings are compatible with animal proteins ( this was his unprompted suggestion) and this would provide some evidence for a typical gesso mix. The professor has offered to pass everything on to a top haematologist but I have not taken this up. I will if there continues to be a challenge. As my posting on the Zittau veil showed there were many different ways of sizing (sealing) a linen cloth but the way in which the images are on the outer fibrils only are compatible with such a sizing and there are lots of other examples, now tested, that could be examined as a comparison with the Shroud. Calcium carbonate or sulphate is an ingredient of such sizing to this very day. So we need to broaden out research by looking at comparative examples- it irks me when people say that the Shroud is unique and then i discover that they have never studied anything about medieval painted linens (as STURP openly admitted they had not!!). The Shroud may or may not be a medieval painted linen but it has many features that suggest that it is one whose images have decayed and to dismiss these out of hand is not serious scholarship. It is the most likely hypothesis for the images and it remains number one until someone provides something better- so it is over to those who can provide a coherent alternative.”“A mass of circumstantial evidence”  Sure you have.  What you have failed to provide, though, is support for your multiple statements that “large amounts of calcium carbonate were found by STURP” .  This is an important point..  You are making a key claim that is not valid.  Moreover, a reference from the same group (STURP) directly states the calcium signal is not from calcium carbonate.  Control older linens used by the STURP investigators (Spanish, Coptic, and Pharonic), also showed high levels of calcium.  Were these gessoed as well?I think STURP considered that the Shroud may be a painting much more than you let on.  But that’s neither here nor there. It’s not my job to convince you of any of this.“If there continues to be a challenge”  [regarding the blood].  I would ask as many people as I could. I do.  Some I know, some I don’t. I’ve e-mailed/called on the phone/talked in person to numerous scientists/clinical specialists to get their professional opinion.  Some say yes.  Some say no.  Some say maybe.  Consider asking chemists, biochemists, immunologists, cell biologists, molecular biologists, forensic scientists, and medical doctors.  Include the other studies as well (esp. Baima Bollone), it’s part of the story, though it’s up to you.A lot of the blood characteristics/science interest me apart from the Shroud-I ask as many people as I can about lot of things, for example how old is the AB blood type? This is a very interesting question, irrespective of anything to do with the Shroud.I like to ask.  I like to learn. Some professional scientists/medical personnel have stated in the past they believe it’s reasonable that real blood exists on the Shroud.  Others say it isn’t.  There you go.

Many such tests can be done more rapidly, more sensitively, but think about it: if these were detected using even such crude techniques, what would even more modern analysis show?

If so, it was unintentional-It may be just a matter of disciplines-biochemistry:immunologyMy perspective (then and now) is one has to consider everything.  It’s all important.  I don’t believe one necessarily trumps the other.  But one has to consider the collective results.  I would be shocked if every box on the blood question could be perfectly checked, all black & white, no grey areas.This might raise the most suspicion for me-it’s old no matter which way you cut it, 700-2,000 years.  Degradation can be an issue, certainly.  But components, for example immunoglobulin, ABO have been reported to survive over time, or at least fragments of them, enough to detect them using immunological methods-If the result is negative, you don’t know, could be degradation or could never have been there to begin with.  If on the other hand, the result is positive and the controls are sound, how does one explain the results?  For me, this takes it past just paint, it takes it to at least primate.Yes, mineral salts are (also) important.  I believe that if one considers the collective results on elemental analysis (STURP, Baima Bollone) as previously written with Thibault, the findings here are reasonable, potassium is not so much an issue. In the previous context, if a misunderstanding was there, it was the point that K+ alone cannot be looked at apart from the whole.  (Nor can it be ignored, either, but I believe-as written with TH-data show that the potassium isn’t lacking).  Whole blood, serum exudates, etc. In STL, I made the point that the most conservative (objective) scientific conclusion is that blood components are present.  I distinguished this from the conclusion that blood is present.  This is especially relevant to the issues of whole blood vs. serum exudate that you mention.  Yes, certainly a medieval forger would not have been aware of the mineral composition.  I think the same goes for addition of serum rings and presence of other blood constituents.  Perhaps a forger could have used real blood in his creation-I think it would be difficult-and would at minimum require the involvement of a body at some point as a template.

For me, this was a huge help in appreciating the congruence between bloodstain patterns, especially the neck region on the dorsal image of the Shroud-I had always found it somewhat difficult to compare specific areas in photographs between the two.  I am unsure if this has ever been computer simulated to overlay/morph between them, but I found this type of approach extremely helpful.Blood typing comparison is an exclusion type test; the only definitive conclusion that can be made from such studies is if distinct blood types exist, indicating that the cloths could not have wrapped the same person.  In the case of the Shroud and Sudarium, with the same blood type, AB, such results are consistent with the idea that the cloths may have at one time covered the same individual, but they are by no means conclusive.  The overlap in bloodstains helps to provide additional evidence of a shared relationship.  If feasible, it would be interesting to evaluate mitochondrial DNA isolated from the bloodstains on both cloths (unlike chromosomal DNA, which is inherited from both parents, mitochondrial DNA is received only from the mother; mitochondrial DNA is typically less fragmented than nuclear DNA and more copies per cell exist).

Has it been considered that folding, rolling of the cloth at some point in time, may have affected how this is perceived, i.e. that a grain may have been pressed more into the fiber (dried bloodstain) than when it originally landed? 2. Another (main) point is: The pollen is adhered to the blood, so they arrived on the cloth at the same time.  Okay, when was this? That is, scientifically speaking, what data is there that speaks to when the blood arrived on this particular cloth? It would be important that these (and other) studies reach the point that the results could be formally summarized and submitted to a major scientific journal.

When others ask questions about a particular scientist’s ideas, it may sometimes be perceived as challenging (threatening), but it need not be.  It’s about trying to sort out what is real and what is not.  There is circumstantial evidence to possibly link the two cloths in association with each other.  What would it really take?

I have broken it up into several parts.My comments: 1. I would agree there is both contaminating & degraded DNA on the Shroud.  I also agree that both issues could be challenging.  In my original reply to OK I said “The most definitive call would be comparative DNA analysis, if doable…”.  When asked in a hypothetical situation, which is more telling, the fact that two people both have a beard & a mustache and/or even share the same blood type versus a comparative DNA analysis between the two, to me, there is no contest.  In the previous context, considering that all four Beatles at one time had beards & mustaches, the strongest piece of scientific evidence on the “amazing list of circumstances” was the same blood type.  Even with shared blood type, albeit one that is the least represented in the population (~5% currently), this can only take you so far, you are still unable to reach a solid, scientific conclusion that the same individual is involved.  In my view, DNA analysis, would be the most definitive way to begin to extend this beyond circumstantial.  Numerous artifacts could share the same the same blood type (AB) and still be unrelated.  It would be much more difficult to understand how two unrelated artifacts would share the same DNA profile (see below comments).  2. All of the above, of course, hinges on your main point, “how do you propose to separate all the DNA”?  It could be a very challenging issue.  Perhaps one advantage the bloodstains may have is that samples could be taken from beneath the surface, or even from the reverse side (beneath the surface), to help minimize contamination (as well as disturb the appearance of the cloth).  Samples would have to be taken from multiple bloodstains for any type of meaningful comparison.  The latter is a minimum for trying to determine if any consensus profile sequences could be achieved.  Maybe it could be done, maybe it couldn’t.   Degradation could be very challenging-it would be important to consider both mitochondrial & nuclear DNA analysis.  The sensitivity and capabilities of molecular biology techniques has significantly advanced within the past two decades-DNA analysis (on either artifact) could potentially extend the current information in a way that other methods/techniques cannot.Maybe it could be done, maybe it couldn’t-there are certainly no guarantees. Such methods also offer the potential to confirm the AB blood type , to look at if certain bloodstains were touched up throughout the years (heterogenous), and if blood from other species (in addition to primate/human) is present on either cloth, among other things. For more details, if interested see: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/kearse3.pdf3. Contamination is a major consideration.  I raised this issue several years ago to temper the oft-promoted selling point for authenticity that “Human DNA has been found on the Shroud”.  (DNA from a human male, no less).  This is related to another major challenge that exists: to demonstrate that there is DNA on the Shroud that originates from bloodstains, as opposed to contaminating skin cells.   I have written about this previously.For more details, if interested see: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/kearse2.pdfIn my opinion, one has to at least consider bringing more modern technology into the discussion, even if it is hypothetical.  If you don’t look, you don’t know.  Even knowing (from empirical data) that degradation and/or contamination is too vast a limitation, is in my mind, progress.  There are only so many times you can retread a tire and repeat the same points from previous studies, again & again (& again).4. Finally, bear in mind, with any of this, I am not a DNA expert.  I don’t consider myself an expert on anything.  Like most scientists active in any aspect of cell biology in the 80s and beyond, I have had some experience working with DNA.  It is not that uncommon-I collaborated with others (molecular biologists) for the heavy lifting.  The oldest artifact I ever worked on were cells that had been growing for three weeks in my incubator.  I continue to read scientific journals weekly, stay in touch with various colleagues, and follow certain lines of interest.  These are simply my thoughts.I trust that God knows what He’s doing with either of these cloths.  Perhaps studies will continue at some point in the future.  Perhaps they won’t.  As a scientist who happens to be a Christian, and a Christian who happens to be a scientist, the subject is a unique & intriguing mix.  I’m okay either way it goes.  If the Shroud were ever conclusively determined to be non-authentic, I would find it ironic that the hand of a forger could be the instrument to summon so much attention to the message of Christ’s redemption for mankind.  To me, that’s the most important thing about the cloth, no matter where one stands on authenticity.","date":"February 19, 2015 at 9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"},{"author":"kelly_kearse","post":"OK,Sorry, bud, sticking to my guns.

It is also important, however, to consider each artifact independently to provide the most objective approach when investigating the properties ascribed to each.  This is a key point.   If an underlying assumption of any investigation is that the two cloths must be related, subjectivity & bias has already crept in.In your previous interrogation, I was asked Yes or No if I thought the cloths belonged to the same person.  My answer is: It’s  possible.  I had the opportunity to visit with Dr. Whanger in his home several years ago and he very patiently demonstrated to me the overlay system featuring the two cloths.  This allowed me to better appreciate the congruence of some of the bloodstains in various regionsYou stated that both the Shroud & Sudarium both belonged to crucified men.  On the Shroud, the crucifixion wounds are obvious in the wrist & feet.  The Sudarium is a head cloth.

The results were published, in Italian, in the very obscure Italian journal devoted to the study of the Turin Shroud. Furthermore, only the raw data were published. That is, the Genoa team published black-and-white Xerox copies of the computer output of the DNA analyzer. This is never, never done. Always, the data are presented in a neat table or figure, and they are accompanied by a discussion of their significance. The Genoa team made no effort to interpret their data.But I was able to interpret the data at once. They are the expected signature of the DNA of a male born in a Virgin Birth! … The Turin Shroud data show 107 (106+1) but not trace of a 112 base pair gene. The Oviedo Cloth data show 105 (106-1) but no trace of a 112 base pair. The X chromosome is present, but there is no evidence of a Y chromosome. This is the expected signature of … virgin birth, the XX male generated by an SRY inserted into an X chromosome. It is not what would be expected of a standard male.Other explanations are possible. The DNA analyzed could be entirely contamination from people who later touched the Shroud and the Cloth. But we have witnesses that men touched the two samples also, and it seems incredible that no trace of male contamination would be seen…. Another possibility is that the Turin Shroud and the Oviedo Cloth are fakes and that the fakes used real blood from males they knew were born of virgins. This possibility, in my opinion, has zero probability.”You asked, Would his interpretation of the DNA be correct?My comments: 1. The basis for the standard chromosomal sex determination is evaluation of the amelogenin gene, which is present on both X & Y chromosomes.  In the X, a 106 base pair version exists, in the Y, a 112 base pair version is found.  This difference in length is the basis for sex determination: in typical females (XX) only the 106 signal is seen; in males (XY), both 106 and 112 versions are detected.2. Tipler proposes that Jesus was XX, with portions of genes from a Y chromosome inserted into the X.  Specifically, the SRY gene (unrelated to amelogenin), which stands for Sex determining Region gene on the Y chromosome, plus he suggests a few other Y specific genes may have been inserted as well.  3. The findings which Tipler is referencing report only a 106 signal, although the same group (Canale) would also state they found “male DNA with traces of female DNA after tests of two threads of the cloth” p 250 in “Enigma of the Shroud” by Petrosillo & Marinelli (1996), ref 7, CHI no 30, August 4, 1995, p 94-97.  So, there is contradiction even there.  As previously noted above, the same group evaluated additional genes that revealed contamination.Be that as it may, just based on the fact of Tipler’s eyeing of raw data with only a 106 signal, to even come remotely close to supporting his idea, insertion of the SRY gene (or other Y specific genes) would need to be evaluated.  This was not done-is entirely speculation, hypothetical4. The only thing I agree with about his interpretation is that normally such results would be published in a major scientific journal.","date":"February 21, 2015 at 1:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"}]}
