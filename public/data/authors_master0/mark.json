What a great read. in October of 2007 I had an emergency surgery and almost died. Now, no NDE but, about one month after the operation I went thru a time of being full of appreciation for the healing hand of our Lord and for the power of prayer. This feeling was so full of goodness, I know the prayers of family and friends were answered. As so many of you have testified, our Lord Jesus Christ will someday return to save us all. America needs to open their eyes and ears to these testimonies. Jesus is calling out to us all. I pray for us to hear his calling voice. Amen to the holy name of Jesus. His name alone can heal and give comfort.

You do a great service by staying skeptical until good evidence comes in. Keep it up.By the way do you know if there is a website with free high resolution images of the shroud?
