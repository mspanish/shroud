{"art":[{"author":"irina","post":"If you truly are of a scientific view on all things i recommend you read the book “The Source Field Investigations” by David Wilcock. In that book there are hundreds of scientifical discoveries on the so called “fringe science” (not mainstream, officially acknowledged or encouraged science), discoveries that will shed light on all that you think you know, that will convince you in the existence of God, of Love, spirituality as the basis of our existence. And if you ponder on many (or all) the things presented there you will feel and know that God is always with you; you are never alone and you will understand what truly matters in life. That book is hidden under a veil of silence in Europe and especially in my country.","date":"March 6, 2012 at 9:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
