{"art":[{"author":"fisherman_al","post":"John 21Breakfast by the Sea 4 But when the morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Then Jesus said to them, “Children, have you any food?”   They answered Him, “No.”    6 And He said to them, “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast, and now they were not able to draw it in because of the multitude of fish.   7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and plunged into the sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish. 9 Then, as soon as they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.”   11 Simon Peter went up and dragged the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken. 12 Jesus said to them, “Come and eat breakfast.” Yet none of the disciples dared ask Him, “Who are You?”—knowing that it was the Lord. 13 Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.14 This is now the third time Jesus showed Himself to His disciples after He was raised from the dead.Dear Brothers and Sisters,Jesus comes to you at the most opportune times. The fishermen in John 21 were most likely about to give up, it was their livelyhood to fish , a very tough but rewarding life. They were most likely up before dawn, set the sails and went out to the sea to catch fish so that they could sell them and feed their families. Jesus had already been crucified and the disciples were back out fishing for fish……On this fine morning they were not catching anything and most likely at the point of giving up….Have you ever been in the position that you were about to give up, feeling that you were on the wrong side….or most likely on the good side and not seeing the fruits of your labor? Either at work or in your personal life? Giving up may be the easy route to go, but remember that Jesus is always there for you, listen to Him and he will guide you through…Well, Jesus instructed the Disciples, they listened.He instructs you, He is always there for you,you just have to listen…Jesus was there for the Disciples, instructed them because He know’s best, He knows where the Fish are…He is the best Fishfinder….He knows what is right for you, He knows you, so listen to Him so that you end up on the Right Side Of A Good Thing.Your Brother in Christ,Fisherman Al","date":"January 8, 2012 at 12:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
