{"forensic":[{"author":"william_lakeman","post":"It’s amazing how much time people will spend analyzing a Medieval fraud. The Shroud of Turin is an obvious fake and you can tell just by looking at it. The head is abnormally small and one of the arms is abnormally short. The figure is also significantly taller than the general population of Jerusalem during that time period. If you saw this guy coming down the street you’d see these things immediately and wonder why this guy was so deformed.And then there’s the fact that an actual burial shroud was found in Jerusalem in the late nineties – did everyone here miss that? Completely different weave and composition.So you got nothing – it showed up in the 1400s and was carbon dated to the 1400s. People were gullible back then and apparently… they still are.","date":"February 12, 2014 at 4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/not-true-the-shroud-of-turin-and-flagrum-proportions-and-measurements-are-identical/","cat":"flagrum","title":"Not True: The Shroud of Turin and Flagrum Proportions and Measurements Are Identical"}]}
