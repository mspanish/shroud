The lack of evidence in creating / transporting such a forgery as you have described should be addressed by Shroud skeptics if skeptics are going to attack and exploit much smaller holes in evidence provided by Shroud supporters.Again, I appreciate your work.

If a Medieval artist was responsible, where are the numerous trials, errors, communications like those that you and many others have done?  Instead there is absolutely nothing, no statues, no writings, no documented trials, hypotheses, nothing.  Was the Medieval artist  so brilliant as to:1.  Devise a way to cover up every last one of his tracks (trials, etc.) save one ‘admission’2.  Complete a perfect anatomy artwork that is unique to its time3.  Create an artwork that uniquely shows up as 3d in VP-8, which he knew nothing about4.  Remember to put Palestinian pollens in it5.  Fool and confound modern scientists for 35 years6.  Fool multiple forensic pathologists into believing it is a real body7.  Create an artwork that shows up better in negative photography than natural light8.  Put it on an authentic linen from the Middle East9.  Do this all by himself, from France.10.  Put the blood / paint on before making the image11.  And again, do all of the above without leaving a single shred of evidenceIf someone 700 years from now looks back at this time, they will find an incredible amount of evidence of skeptics attempting to replicate the Shroud of Turin.  Where is the evidence from the person attempting to make the original?","date":"April 3, 2016 at 7:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/contact-prints-from-a-3d-figure-will-always-be-wider-and-suffer-from-wrap-around-distortion-true-or-false/","cat":"contact_imprint","title":"Contact prints from a 3D figure will always be wider and suffer from wrap-around distortion.
