{"art":[{"author":"rosalie","post":"I put off reading Heaven is For Real but was drawn to reading it while on R&R in Florida. I flipped through the pictures, stopped at this one, went on to read. But felt compiled to return to this picture, did and then went back to reading. The third time I was drawn back to this picture I stayed there and found myself saying aloud, “I have seen Him.” I was a victim of incest. As soon as I immediately spoke that sentence aloud, it flashed in my mind that it was HIM who sat on the bed and held me while I cried. I don’t really care if anyone believes me because I know it happened and HE looked exactly like this when HE held me. This proves He is with us always, through good and bad. Thanks for listening and for me seeing this picture is the truth as I know it and no one can change my mind.","date":"August 25, 2011 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
