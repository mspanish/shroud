He has always done many miracles also. One of the miracles is using these comments today I have seen on this site to encourage me when I needed it most. I have been through so many things- and one of the problems was listening to Religious Leaders who tell us to put up with things we don’t need to put up with- but I will say this… even in the midst of the trials… My Heavenly Father through Jesus has never ever let me down when I need comfort and peace as long as I tell Him my sorrows and read His Word- He comforts me… so I urged those who doubt to simply talk to Him. He will reveal Himself to you.","date":"October 17, 2011 at 2:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"resources":[{"author":"suzanne","post":"Faith???
