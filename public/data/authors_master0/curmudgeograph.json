E.g., the reason that radical Darwinists propose random mutation and natural selection is it seems to them more concept-economical than say love or God being behind it all.

Randomness is legitimate grist for the mill.  We can talk about the pseudo-randomness that computers can give us, we can talk about not being able to account for the factors determining the roll of the dice, we can talk Schrodinger, we can talk Darwin, and we can talk spinning off universes wherein maybe we get back to the dice.  Where not locked into one of the above, or other categories, I think the man-on-the-street’s concept works for me.  Now you’ve got me interested in Benford & Zipf.  But first I gotta pick up all the branches the wind blew down this week.  “… after enlightenment, chop wood and carry water.”Thanks for reading.  I’ll check out your writings.","date":"September 8, 2012 at 2:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/08/a-curmudgeon-what-if-another-god-next-to-him-is-doing-a-different-simulation/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Curmudgeon: What if another God next to him is doing a different simulation?"}]}
