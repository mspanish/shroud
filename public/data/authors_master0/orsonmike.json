{"misc":[{"author":"orsonmike","post":"To Yannick – while you mention that the Shroud reveals the human nature of Jesus, it is EQUALLY true that it does reveal the historical TRUTH of His Resurrection as well –  and thus His DIVINE nature. Case in point – at the exact moment of the resurrection, a VAST outpouring of X-rays and gamma rays occured leaving behind an imprint for the doubting Thomases of the modern world. The exact nature of this imprint has been studied deeply by experts and they have opined that NO such technology existed in history at that time to confer a “negative”  (as colour-INVERTED in photography)  image on the Shroud. The process is x-ray lithography or laser lithography and most important it is a 3-D Rendition which is IMPOSSIBLE to forge considering the argument of skeptics that it was a forgery! Much marterial pointing out to this FACTUM is readily accessible on the Internet for those who need  to validate these statements. In TRUTH, God does NOT need us – rather WE need GOD! The funny part is skeptics and athiests readily believe in NDE’s and other Lazarus-like experiences. However, we theorize and rationalize when it comes to Jesus and His Resurrection.","date":"June 7, 2013 at 9:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/16/a-winning-shroud-of-turin-expository-speech/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Winning Shroud of Turin Expository Speech"}]}
