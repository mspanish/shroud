{"art":[{"author":"julie","post":"I was raised by my Grandmother whose greatest gift to me is the faith in a loving and merciful God, who is perfect. I have never seen Jesus and rarely felt His presence, but I know He is here all the time. My aunt died at 91 in 2006. She raised me with my grandmother. I know she believed in God and I know she was also afraid to die. She also knew that I have the same faith in God that her mother, my grandmother had. When her body was ready to stop and her soul was ready to go to heaven she opened her eyes and looked at me. I said “Don’t be afraid, hold my hand and close your eyes. I am going to put your hand in the hand of Jesus. He will take you to His Father in heaven.” I did not not make this up, the words came out of my mouth completely unrehearsed. While I said them their was a hand on each of my shoulders. This is real. I never saw Jesus, but He stood behind me and took her hand as she passed from this life to the next. This is the holiest place I have ever been: in the Hospice room, with my Aunt Betty, Jesus, and my faith. I haven’t heard from Him since in this way, but I know there is a God and there is definitely a risen Christ. I am not crazy either.","date":"April 7, 2012 at 2:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"julie","post":"Hello.   Over the last 10 years I have been in the field of healing arts.  I have experienced the healing power of Christ working in and through people’s lives, not to mention the feelings and experiences I have with Yeshua.  I feel that he is real and very authentic. As you can see from the postings, a lot happens to people.  You can grow bitter and full of grief, shame, guilt, etc. and this feels like a seperation from God.  God doesn’t ever throw us out, we choose to walk out.  Many times I have questioned why things happen to people.  I feel most of it is getting us to feel so uncomfortable in what ever we are in that we will eventually choose a different way.  We move from those obstacles that are keeping us trapped.  We grow out of the muck and mire.   We uncover ourselves and may not acknowledge that God is right there helping us shovel off the composte pile of traumas, pain and societal conditioning.  It is a continual process of allowing love to reighn over fear.   After the storms clear and you can see forever…you can see the true self within, knowing that was an experience of growth.  It’s over…these dark things too pass away.  Christ’s light then shines into and through your vessel.  This human body that allows our spirit to have a physical experience.  Thank you for your sharing of these heart-felt reinactments of your past moments in time.  It is wonderful to hear the faith and truth in each one.  I show the youtube video Akaine made when she was 10 to clients.  Her innocent and loving ways always brighten their spirit and they know that God is very real.  Sometimes we need reminders.  She truly has been given many talent gifts to express God’s everlasting and unconditional love.There has been so much contraversy over the Shoud of Turin and no one has come to any conclusions that we all can agree on at this time.   It is often dilluted into something less by people’s belief systems.  Confusion has been a social engineering staple in spinning things until no one really knows what to believe.  Christ’s dedicated shroud is etched into everyone’s heart through his sacrifice of love.  We can integrate that love into our daily lives or we can leave it there untapped as if it is fraudulant.  Either way I feel it is there for each of us.    I like your comment earlier poster:  “It’s an appetizer for what is to come.”  Have a beautiful life in love and light.","date":"June 1, 2012 at 11:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"julie","post":"i just finished the book heaven is for real, i loved it, i have always believed myself to be christian but fell i may have been wrong. one of the things colton drives his parents nuts with is “jesus loves the childern”, i want to do more for the childern in my commuity but dont know what, i must not be listeningi am beyond happy to hear i will see my parents again when i go to heaven as they are both really sick and it clams me to know i will see them again","date":"July 4, 2011 at 3:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/24/more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
