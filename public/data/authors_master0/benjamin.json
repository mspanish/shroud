{"history":[{"author":"benjamin","post":"I noticed something while watching this program and was wondering why it wasn’t touched upon in the special. There are other faces that can only be seen in the negatives. Even then, it takes a keen eye to spot. I’m not talking about the second face on the back of the shroud that has already been explained. This is totally different. It depicts a totally different angle, as if capturing the “spirit” if you will, exiting the body. I have a similar picture taken at a park of someone and it showed 3 images of the same person at different angles, only because the camera moved. I found this EXACT type of image in the negative of the shroud. The image of the face would have to had been traveling in order to create this anomoly. This is no joke, hoax, nor prank. Please contact me.","date":"March 31, 2010 at 2:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/30/abc-good-morning-america-on-tonights-history-channel-shroud-of-turin-special-2/","cat":"history","title":"First Reaction: History Channel’s Shroud of Turin: The Real Face of Jesus"}]}
