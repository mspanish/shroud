{"misc":[{"author":"brandon","post":"I admit I dont know what to believe. I saw a history channel show about the shroud and the team doing the 3-D image of who they claim to be Jesus. I was looking at the pictures on the internet to see the location of the blood stains. I was sent to a christian school, college, etc. and have had some limited medical training. I have for years thought “christians” were so stupid. I always thought everyone thought it was possible for a human body to be nailed to a cross through the palms of the hands. This would never work because the weight of the person would tear the nail or spike through the hand, there is not enough tissue to support the his weight. What I see in the shroud is that the spikes were more likely put through the wrist where the weight of the body could be supported by Radius and Ulnar and kept attached by the ligaments and tendons in the wrist and hand. All the pictures ie: the crucifix at the catholic churches always show the nails in the palms. My wife is catholic and I admit I always get a good laugh when I am forced to attend something at her church. Anyway, I see that the location of the blood stain is close to the wrist so if it were real I think this would be a correct placement, not the palm.  Just my opinion.","date":"January 25, 2011 at 8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/11/23/late-breaking-website-news/","cat":"2010","title":"Late Breaking Website News!"}],"opinion":[{"author":"brandon","post":"Thanks for pointing out those mistakes.
