It’s true ! Your really there ! You really care”.I never heard of St. Paul’s experience on his Way to Damascus before this…But after wards discovered how similar the experience of a great light from above was.The question for me is not whether heaven is real or is there a God anymore…the question is now about accountability before God…and is there more that I can do to share this and later experiences of God’s love.I believe there is…maybe a book…God knows.Please pray about that for me.Thank you and God bless.","date":"December 14, 2011 at 2:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"john_macgillivray","post":"I briefly met this artist while staying at a Russian Orthodox commune.He was greatly influenced by baroness Catherine de Hueck Dorothy who left Russia with her family when a little girl and who was the founder of Madonna House apostolate in Ontairio.She was the one that was responsible for William Kurelek’s return to his faith.","date":"January 28, 2012 at 12:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/26/the-christ-of-the-shroud-of-turin-and-other-reminders/","cat":"art","title":"The Christ of the Shroud of Turin and other reminders"}],"events":[{"author":"john_macgillivray","post":"95 % confident ?

The whole experience couldn’t have lasted more than five to several seconds…but I then fell back onto my pillow as the door opened to my room and a nurse entered.She didn’t know what had just happened…and I have never forgotten.I afterwards had fellowship with every denomination you can think of in my town and other parts of the country.A Russian Orthodox commune and Trappist monastery being the last two places I spent some time until I settled into the faith I was raised in.I’ve witnessed to my faith countless times but rarely shared this particular event regarding my “road to Damascus” experience which entailed a similar light to that of St. Paul.So now I feel I am ready to share this “miraculous” experience and to tell it like it is…I didn’t know how to share it before and was mostly always afraid that no one would believe it.But I will leave that up to whoever hears it and to God.I have no fear of what others will think about this anymore because I know that I will need to give an account to God Himself and it’s what He thinks that really matters.Why it took 40 years to prepare me to speak out about this I do not know…I can only quote something from scripture which may explain it some.”Silver is for the smelter,gold is for the furnace,but the purification of the heart by fire is of God.God bless…as a final comment I want to say…. that I have an absolute certainty or conviction that the Shroud of Turin is undoubtedly the true burial cloth of Christ.I believe that it was a burst of light during his “predicted” resurrection which left the image on the cloth.It was left to us as both a testament and legacy for future generations.","date":"February 18, 2012 at 12:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/17/so-swings-and-roundabouts-darn-dawkins-didnt-ask-about-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"So, swings and roundabouts: Darn, Dawkins didn’t ask about the shroud."},{"author":"john_macgillivray","post":"To me it makes “perfect” sense that God would allow at  least a miraculous image behind for future hundreds of millions to see.For those generations to come after him and not have the good fortune to hear His Son speak or witness His countless miracles which were performed on a daily basis.The preservation and survival of this sacred relic is a miracle in itself.And the fact that it now exist for millions to witness and study today convinces me that it was from all time…intended that way.","date":"March 2, 2012 at 10:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/02/that-was-me-once-upon-a-time-i-was-sure-the-shroud-of-turin-was-fake/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"That was me once upon a time.
