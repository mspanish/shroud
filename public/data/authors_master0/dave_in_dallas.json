{"dating":[{"author":"dave_in_dallas","post":"for years I wondered why they carbon-dated the corner of the fabric.  Any IDIOT would know that part had been handled, greased up, rubbed on, sweated into and otherwise contaminated for centuries.And what about the spores?  Aren’t there microscopic plant spores in the fabric that are only found in the mediterranean coastal region of Palestine?  Isn’t there evidence the cloth comes from that area?Some scientist really needs to explain the image.  Is it a result of temperature over a short time?  A flash?  Some kind of radiation?  Is it seeping chemicals from a body?  If so, why is the image so THIN on the cloth?  And how would medieval types know the design of the Roman flail?  or that we would later know how to prove human blood through analysis, so they needed to use real blood for the ‘fake’ stains?it’s all SO hard to rationalize UNLESS you’re so psychologically wedded to it NOT being real that you just ignore all the unlikelihoods.","date":"June 1, 2010 at 7:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/25/shroud-of-turin-ohio-state-university-lecture-on-carbon-dating-problem/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Shroud of Turin Ohio State University Lecture on Carbon Dating Problem"}]}
