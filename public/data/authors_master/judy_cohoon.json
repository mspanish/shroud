While the Bible was written many years ago, I did believe it, BUT having read this little one’s account, someone who had no prior knowledge, so you knew it wasn’t dreams, you know without a doubt that even the Bible is for real.  Nothing has touched me like this book did.  I cannot talk nor describe the book to anyone without gettting chills.  I read the book 3 times and have listened to it once.  I just can’t get enough.  I have recommended and gotten the book for so many people and it has touched them all.\nColton and his dad are truly God’s angels for sharing this with us.\n\n","date":"July 24, 2011 at 2:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"judy_cohoon","post":"I have read the book 3 times and he never said God had wings.  He did say God was really big and that He loved us all so very much.  I would read the book, I found nothing wrong in any of his memories of heaven.  I believe every word of it and it is deepend my belief in God, Jesus and Heaven.  This was God’s plan for Colton’s dad to write this book.  Much easier to believe a 3 year old’s account of heaven before he had had a chance to form him own opinions, than it was for me to belief an adult’s account after they have developed or formed their own concepts and knew what the bible promises.\n\n","date":"August 29, 2011 at 11:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"judy_cohoon","post":"I read “Heaven is for Real” twice and can’t wait to read it again.  I just can’t get enough of it.  It is powerful, amazing and I now have a clear picture of what heaven is like.  While the Bible tells us all this, it took seeing heaven through a four year olds eye, that I truly beleive and so many questions were answered.  I highly recommend this book for nonbelievers and believers.  And the story of the pictures of Jesus that the little boy was shown and they never were just right, either the eyes or the hair wasn’t the Jesus he saw, but once he saw this picture painted by the little girl who also visited heaven, Prince of Peace, he said “yes, that is him”.  The four year old convinced this 68 year old and truly made a believer (with no doubts, or questions).  Read the book.\n\n","date":"May 29, 2011 at 5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
