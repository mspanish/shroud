All the characters (cherubs included) seem to observe the side which is not being displayed. You could however point to creases in the weave and barely discernible intensity differences in certain areas in the upper part of the shroud as proof of the seam of the shroud running along the top. This was actually my initial impression. But in the end I think this is an example of pareidolia for what we both want to see. Stronger arguments for explaining away the faintness would be required.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/01/picture-for-today-2/","cat":"art","title":"Picture for Today"},{"author":"henrik","post":"Yes the backing cloth was there in 1650 so the artist probably didn´t know what the reversed side looked like.

But one could not efface nor remove these imprints and marks of our sweet Lord.”\nIt also reminds me of an experiment by Mario Moroni and Remi van Haelst where modern linen (relatively high amount of C14) was boiled in mineral oil (relatively low amount of C14). Samples of treated and no treated linen were then radiocarbon dated by Toronto and Oxford who noticed a 36% decrease in C14 for the treated piece. \nThe paper can be found here: https://www.shroud.com/vanhelst.htm\nSo what about the opposite conditions of old linen and modern oil based on vegetable or animal (fat)? I made some rough calculations based on the assumption that the exchange of carbon atoms between linen and oil affected 36% of the linen carbon atoms and estimated the new age to be around 2000 years taking into account the exponential decrease from 1500.\nIt seems reasonable anyway to have a radiocarbon estimation of age closer to the moment of contamination as Mark Guscin reported the expert telling in the quote from OK.\nStrange that no one has investigated this alternative further!\n\n","date":"April 20, 2014 at 12:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/ray-schneider-why-is-the-carbon-dating-wrong-i-dont-know-that-it-is-wrong-i-am-quite-certain/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Ray Schneider: Why is the carbon dating wrong?

I think you have argued quite convincingly why we should treat Antoine de Lalaing’s claim with extra caution and will only grant boiling in oil a small chance of being true. \nWhat I had in mind was the shroud suspended at its center on a wooden plank with its both ends submerged in the vessel for testing the effects on the lower part of the frontal foot region. But of course I have no evidence to back it up with. I don’t consider Pam Moons argument for this part being cut away based on the Lier copy very strong for example. Later copies shows the same trend of a longer shroud. And the distances poker holes – edge is roughly the same for both ends of the cloth.\nHowever, whatever the reasons might be, the radiocarbondated area seems to be quite contaminated with later added substances. It’s the combination of contamination and heat (1532 fire) that concerns me the most. And the only studie I have come across which take both into account is the Moroni – van Haelst paper mentioned above.
