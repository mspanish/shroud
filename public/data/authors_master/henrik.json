All the characters (cherubs included) seem to observe the side which is not being displayed. You could however point to creases in the weave and barely discernible intensity differences in certain areas in the upper part of the shroud as proof of the seam of the shroud running along the top. This was actually my initial impression. But in the end I think this is an example of pareidolia for what we both want to see. Stronger arguments for explaining away the faintness would be required.","date":"February 2, 2015 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/01/picture-for-today-2/","cat":"art","title":"Picture for Today"},{"author":"henrik","post":"Yes the backing cloth was there in 1650 so the artist probably didn´t know what the reversed side looked like.

Perhaps the common features within the tradition can be explained on the basis of mutual inspiration? This was simply the version of the Shroud that belonged to the common mindset during a couple of centuries in the same way as the negative contrast enhanced versions of the SOT, that show up on google, is how people imagine the shroud nowadays.

Maybe they interpreted the visible elbows as proof of an image formation taking place during the initial phase while the body where carried down from the cross or to the tomb – I don´t think that´s a very strong point in itself – without asserting that the elbows don’t fit into your historical reconstruction or your school of image mechanisms.","date":"January 22, 2015 at 9:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/you-cannot-fold-and-unfold-a-painting-and-more/","cat":"art","title":"You cannot fold and unfold a painting (and more)"}],"blood":[{"author":"henrik","post":"John Jackson tries to explain the same kind of artifact at the neck region about 7 min into this clip:I think his configuration of the shroud is equally possible as Colin’s (but I side with Berry when it comes to close contact vs radiation).","date":"July 14, 2014 at 5:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/13/why-doesnt-the-blood-create-an-image/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Why Doesn’t the Blood Create an Image?"}],"dating":[{"author":"henrik","post":"Isn’t the overlapping watermark a greater problem for the reweave hypothesis than Jackson´s banding structures?","date":"March 8, 2015 at 8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"author":"henrik","post":"From OK’s quote above:” …as oil is not cleaned by the laboratory processes used before carbon dating and if oil is present on a sample, the date produced by carbon dating is in fact the date of contamination.”Very interesting given the historical hints that the shroud may have been boiled in oil some time before 1500, Antoine de Lalaing:“To prove if it was the true Shroud, it was boiled in oil, tossed in fire, laundered different and numerous times. But one could not efface nor remove these imprints and marks of our sweet Lord.”It also reminds me of an experiment by Mario Moroni and Remi van Haelst where modern linen (relatively high amount of C14) was boiled in mineral oil (relatively low amount of C14). Samples of treated and no treated linen were then radiocarbon dated by Toronto and Oxford who noticed a 36% decrease in C14 for the treated piece. The paper can be found here: https://www.shroud.com/vanhelst.htmSo what about the opposite conditions of old linen and modern oil based on vegetable or animal (fat)? I made some rough calculations based on the assumption that the exchange of carbon atoms between linen and oil affected 36% of the linen carbon atoms and estimated the new age to be around 2000 years taking into account the exponential decrease from 1500.It seems reasonable anyway to have a radiocarbon estimation of age closer to the moment of contamination as Mark Guscin reported the expert telling in the quote from OK.Strange that no one has investigated this alternative further!","date":"April 20, 2014 at 12:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/ray-schneider-why-is-the-carbon-dating-wrong-i-dont-know-that-it-is-wrong-i-am-quite-certain/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Ray Schneider: Why is the carbon dating wrong?

I think you have argued quite convincingly why we should treat Antoine de Lalaing’s claim with extra caution and will only grant boiling in oil a small chance of being true. What I had in mind was the shroud suspended at its center on a wooden plank with its both ends submerged in the vessel for testing the effects on the lower part of the frontal foot region. But of course I have no evidence to back it up with. I don’t consider Pam Moons argument for this part being cut away based on the Lier copy very strong for example. Later copies shows the same trend of a longer shroud. And the distances poker holes – edge is roughly the same for both ends of the cloth.However, whatever the reasons might be, the radiocarbondated area seems to be quite contaminated with later added substances. It’s the combination of contamination and heat (1532 fire) that concerns me the most. And the only studie I have come across which take both into account is the Moroni – van Haelst paper mentioned above. Sadly they do not seem to have taken the cleaning procedure beyond the standard acid-base-acid technique to include the more sophisticated cleaning procedures mentioned in Hugh’s two interesting links.","date":"April 26, 2014 at 9:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/10/ray-schneider-why-is-the-carbon-dating-wrong-i-dont-know-that-it-is-wrong-i-am-quite-certain/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Ray Schneider: Why is the carbon dating wrong?
