{"art":[{"id":"comment-6503","author":"esther","post":"A six year old with what seems like the entire world’s hurt pressing in his eyes screams at the top of his lungs to a classmate, “You suck, you stupid asshole!” I am weary. It is 2 days before winter break, and all I wish to do is finish the pile of assessments before me. Assessments that must be done one to one with each child, assessments the outcomes of which will soon determine my salary, assessments which completely dishonor/undermine the tireless work the children and I trudge through daily. I drag myself towards him and a chair slams to the floor. The other children barely look up from their work this has become such a common occurrence. I reach Joshua and pick him up. He continues to kick and scream nailing my shins several times, but does not fight hard enough to give the impression of really wanting to be let go. In seconds, he is sobbing from deep within his being. I sit down and rest his head on my lap and whisper a prayer in his ear ending with the song, remember little one, Joshua fought the battle of Jericho, Jericho, Jericho. I then look up then to see if the other children are still working and catch Evelyn’s deep, sad, and knowing eyes, in hers I see wisdom, too much wisdom for yet another six year old. She only a week ago came to me brimming with tears. We had to hide in the bathroom last night. My Dad was hurting my Mom. She has to stay in the hospital now. I work up a smile for Evelyn, and she nods smiling herself and goes back to helping little Sandra learn English. Jesus really loves the children, but I am terrified that I cannot keep on loving them as he does….","date":"2012-01-03","mins":"1:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
