{"blood":[{"author":"jean_l_genibrel","post":"Why is everyone trying to prove that it is Jesus on the cloth? Thus far no one has been able to do so. How about trying to find whose likeness truly is on the cloth? \nThe Shroud is real. It is not a fake. The proof is that it can be seen and it has been seen by millions. The question is whose image is imprinted on the cloth?. Does it necessarily need to be Jesus because he is the most acclaimed person to have been crucified? MAny other people were tortured and crucified.  Who else has been crucified? Who else was tortured and crucified and dressed with a crown of thorns? We know the approximate time period the cloth was made (1310-1340 and from where it emanates (Palestine). How could such a cloth have survived 2000 years?\nSome answers: First the cloth is probably not 2000 years old. It is probably more like 700 years old. The Templars were also known as heretics like Jesus was. They had brought back numerous objects and artifacts from Palestine including cloth and clothing. Many of them were burned at the stake. The most renowned was Jacques de Molay the leader of the Templars. He too was tortured in the same fashion Jesus was and he was crucified. This took place in France where the Shroud was first discovered not long after the death of de Molay. The markings on the cloth were made by blood, sweat and acids the body produces when it is in extreme agony.\nPS: Even the Catholic religion does not claim the Shroud to be “an original” as in the true image of Jesus.\n\n","date":"December 25, 2012 at 5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper"}],"events":[{"author":"jean_l_genibrel","post":"Has anyone attempted to determine who is on the cloth rather than trying to prove that it is Jesus because the image looks like Jesus after the crucifixion?\n\n","date":"January 25, 2013 at 11:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/25/eric-j-jumper-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Eric J.
