I have an icon of the (same) image painted on wood that I purchased many years ago at the St. Catherine’s monastery in Sinai — after seeing the 6th century original on the wall. Sitting at my desk here in Paris, I just printed out your rendition and have now placed it immediately below my painted icon on wood. No doubt in my mind; both images taken from the Shroud — one by an artist of the day, the other by you ( I surmise) with the help of the Dynamic Auto Painter program.","date":"February 24, 2013 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/24/impression-for-a-sunday/","cat":"art","title":"Impression for a Sunday"},{"author":"judy","post":"Maybe “The First” is Adam and Eve, the first couple?","date":"March 16, 2012 at 10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"resources":[{"author":"judy","post":"go to KTO!!!","date":"March 30, 2013 at 12:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/29/now-available-video-from-abc-news-good-morning-america/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Now Available:  Video from ABC News Good Morning America"}]}
