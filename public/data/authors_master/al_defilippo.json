{"opinion":[{"author":"al_defilippo","post":"Thank you, Fr. Paul, for the post. For more on Charles Wesley, please visit the website for the book series, The Asbury Triptych Series. The trilogy based on the life of Francis Asbury opens with the book, Black Country. Black Country details the religious climate experienced by Francis Asbury in mid to late 18th-century England. The book also brings to light the many influences on this young man who eventually leaves for the American colonies in 1771. Again, thank you for the post. The evidence of changed lives, myself included, is the evidence of Christ.\n\n","date":"July 25, 2015 at 10:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/24/so-long-as-there-are-questions/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"So Long As There AreÂ Questions"}]}
