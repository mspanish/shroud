The book traces how the Convenae used their marble to help create their identity, invisible before Pompey but amongst the richest and most distinctive in Gaul by the second century A.D.\n>Drawing on his own excavations at Saint-Bertrand and the extensive earlier and recent work there, Simon Esmonde Cleary combines a clear description of the buildings and monuments of Lugdunum and of its countryside with a discussion of what they can tell us about the impact of Rome on this remote corner of its empire.\n>This book will be extremely valuable to ancient historians, classicists and students of Roman archaeology, and contains a guide to the visible Roman remains of the area…\n— — —\nHere another paper:\nA.S.Esmonde Cleary & J.Wood:\nLe rempart de la “ville haute”, in R.Sablayrolles ed.: Lugdunum des Convènes (Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges/Valcabrère, Haute Garonne): acquis récents de la recherche (1992-2002), Aquitania XVIII (2002), 65-74 \nLink:\nhttp://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/caha/esmonde-cleary-simon.aspx\n\n","date":"March 24, 2015 at 8:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/21/tabor-a-distinctive-1st-century-weave/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Tabor: A Distinctive 1st Century Weave"}],"art":[{"author":"piero","post":"I apologize if I am now a bit ‘off topic …\n However, there are two issues that I do not seem to have been explored:\n1) DNA and Jewish Tombs in Jerusalem and near Giv’at ha-Mivtar…\n2) The tomb of Josef  (= Joseph, the foster father of Jesus).\n>An ancient tradition states that the tomb of St. Joseph, now empty, is in the Valley of Josaphat.

I asked Charles Parker—a latent-fingerprint examiner with more than thirty years of experience in the field, who has helped to establish guidelines for fingerprint examiners in the United States—to review the chapter. He said that most of the arrows don’t point to actual overlapping characteristics, just random details, and that, judging from the images presented, the partial fingerprint on “La Bella Principessa” is too poorly detailed for an identification to be made. “No other examiner I know would sign off on it,” he said. “I couldn’t even get it past the door.” Wertheim agreed with this assessment, and suggested that Biro’s approach was the equivalent of trying to identify a man based on seeing his ear poking out from behind a bush for a fraction of a second.\n>“The fingerprint community can get quite dogmatic,” Biro told me in another conversation. “They don’t like people who rock the boat, and I could be seen as a loose cannon to some, because I’m questioning a lot of things.”\nSource :\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/07/12/100712fa_fact_grann\n— —\nand from another source :\n>The attribution to Leonardo DaVinci, based on  the multispectral scanning of  the Research Laboratory Lumiere-Technology, was confirmed in 2009 by six Art historians, Nicholas Turner, Carlo Pedretti, Alessandro Vezzosi, Mina Gregori, CristinaGeddo and Martin Kemp.\n>The main opposition came from the experts in New York and from some observers who had missed this attribution when the work was in the hands of Christie’s and the Gallery Ganz, against the background of lawsuit at the Court of New York brought against Christie’s by Jeanne Marchig, the previous owner who had consigned the drawing to the auction house for sale.\n>Through the knowledge of the original colours of the restored work, Martin Kemp and Pascal Cotte had tentatively identified the portrait as that of Bianca, the illegitimate daughter of Duke Ludovico Sforza, who was legitimized in 1496 and married to Galeazzo Sanseverino, Commander of the armies of the Duke. She died tragically a few months after her marriage. \nLink :\nhttp://www.lumiere-technology.com/discoveries2.html\n— —\nBut … there are other stories around Bianca Sforza :\nAccording to Italian art historian Carla Glori, the face of the enigmatic “Mona Lisa” (also known as “La Gioconda”), painted by the great Renaissance master Leonardo Da Vinci, and the replica, the “Prado Mona Lisa” is the face of Bianca Giovanna Sforza. However, that claim does not convince those who have sustained for many years the belief that it is a portrait of Mona Lisa or Lisa Gherardini.\n>Based on research by Glori, Bianca Sforza was the wife of Galeazzo Sanseverino and the legitimate daughter of Ludovico il Moro and Bernadina de Corradis, who lived in Bobbio, in northern Italy. The writer claims the portrait was painted from the Malaspina dal Verme Castle, Bobbio, from where there is an observable bridge, the Ponte Vecchio Bobbio (Old Bridge of Bobbio), visible over the sitter’s left shoulder.  …  …\nInstead\n>Retired Oxford professor Martin Kemp, however, said the bridge in the portrait of Lisa del Giocondo and the historic Bobbio bridge do not seem very similar.\n>“There have been many attempts to identify the landscape as a specific location and I do not find the resemblance to the Bobbio bridge all that close,” Kemp said, according to The Daily Mail.\nSource :\nhttp://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/arts-entertainment/the-two-faces-of-leonardo-da-vincis-mona-lisa-192868.html\n— —-\nHere the last story : an italian book …\nEnigma Leonardo: decifrazioni e scoperte vol.1\nLa Gioconda.

Garza-Valdes was right, that he (Adler) had checked his fibers and found the bioplastic coating on them … Instead in the article published in 1999 the famous american chemist (Adler = 1931* – 2000 +) denied the prodigious amount of bacterial metabolism and wrote something about the claims of pervasive amount of polyester that was not seen in the whole cloth infrared spectral studies, nor in the microFTIR studies, nor in the enzymatic studies …\n— —\nIn 1998 I underlined the possibility to use the SPMs as useful tools to detect the truth.\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is extensively being used for characterizing thin film surfaces and then I am curious to see what are the results from the controls on thin layers on linen fibrils (=  in order to improve the knowledges [see : the question about the cellulosic DP], to detect the contamination [= bacterial and fungal attacks] and also try to understand the level of contamination and the BIF…)\nand\ncontrols on red blood cells …\nFor example : the nanomechanical characteristics of the membrane cytoskeleton of human erythrocytes were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM).\nReference (only as an example) : the study\n“Atomic force microscopic observation of surface-supported human erythrocytes” \nHere an excerpt from the abstract\n>The self-assembly, fine structure, cell diameter, thickness, and reticulate cytoskeleton of erythrocytes on the mica surface were investigated. The adhesive forces that correspond to the membrane elasticity of various parts of the erythrocyte membrane surface were measured directly by AFM to be 0.64±0.14 nN for cell indentation, 4.2±0.7 nN for cell hump, and 11.5 nN for side waist, respectively.

The in vivo\nphotoproducts were identified by chromatographic comparison with authentic synthetic standards using two complementary methods.\n>Bilirubin photooxidation products were not detected in\nurine from jaundiced infants not receiving phototherapy. The\nspecific photoproducts identified in the urine include propentdyopents, hematinic acid imide and its hydrolysis product (3-carboxy-2-methyl-2-hexenedioic acid), and the hydrolysis product (2-vinyl-3-methyl-maleic acid) of methylvinylmaleimide.\n>Their total urinary concentrations were low (0.2-0.9 mg/dl) during phototherapy. These observations show that photooxidation of bilirubin clearly does occur during phototherapy. They are consistent with the view that, although photooxidation is not the major photochemical event associated with phototherapy, it can and clearly does occur concurrently with photoisomerization.\nLink:\nhttp://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v18/n8/pdf/pr19842055a.pdf?origin=publication_detail\n— — —\nAnother question:\nIs it possible associate hematohydrosis with a variation of bilirubin?\nUnfortunately I have not found the answer for that, instead I have read (other) few medical lines about bilirubin taken from:\n“Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia”\nAuthor: Richard A Weisiger, MD, PhD;\nChief Editor: BS Anand, MD\n>Because bilirubin is highly insoluble in water, it must be converted into a soluble conjugate before elimination from the body. In the liver, uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronyl transferase converts bilirubin to a mixture of monoglucuronides and diglucuronides, referred to as conjugated bilirubin, which is then secreted into the bile by an ATP-dependent transporter. This process is highly efficient under normal conditions, so plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentrations remain low. \n>A large number of disease states lead to bilirubin accumulation in plasma. Diseases that increase the rate of bilirubin formation, such as hemolysis, or diseases that reduce the rate of bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome, produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. \nLink:\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178757-overview\n— — —\nIf we want to follow Max Patrick Hamon and\nhis particular idea connected with “ancient Judean ritual in the shape of fumigation/burning aromatic woods/spices (= 2 Chronicles 16:14 – 21:19 Targum)” then the last problem to solve can be the following:\n– “What is the changing of the color of a blood stain after fumigation?”\nI have not yet found an answer about that question…\n\n","date":"February 3, 2015 at 9:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?"},{"author":"piero","post":"I was a bit defocused because I have reread the entire past discussion (on bilirubin):\n“Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo”\nApril 4, 2013\n— —\nI beg your pardon…\n\n","date":"February 3, 2015 at 9:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?"}],"dating":[{"author":"piero","post":"I hope not to be misunderstood.\nI do not believe that there are strange secret messages based on cotton …\nWhat interested me emphasize is the solution to the problem inherent to the study of the frequency with which Cotton appears in blend Linen/Cotton.\nLinen is the strongest of all the vegetable fibers, perhaps\nwith 2 to 3 times the strength of Cotton and\nit contains lignin.

Van Haelst did proposed\nthe temperature of 180 °C.\nLater Mario Moroni made about the same experiments.\nHe measured ~180 °C for the place were the samples were taken.\nAnd (of course) this is in contradiction with the 25 °C proposed by Rogers.\nFollowing Rogers, the low thermal conductivity of linen excluded\nsuch a high temperature.\nBut Ray Rogers was unaware of the experiments of Moroni…\nand then this researcher (Rogers) did not continued further in thermochemical-textile research because he died in 2005 … \nDo you know other details?\nUnder the address :\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/page/5/\nthere was a long commentary …\nBut without mentioning the question of Vanillin in old books…\nSee for example:\nThat “Old Book Smell” Is a Mix of Grass and Vanilla\nSmell is chemistry, and the chemistry of old books gives your cherished tomes their scent\nby\nColin Schultz        = smithsonian.com  (June 18, 2013)\nLink:\nhttp://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/that-old-book-smell-is-a-mix-of-grass-and-vanilla-710038/?no-ist\n>Smell is chemistry, and the chemistry of old books gives your cherished tomes their scent. As a book ages, the chemical compounds used—the glue, the paper, the ink–begin to break down. And, as they do, they release volatile compounds—the source of the smell.\n>A common smell of old books, says the International League for Antiquarian Booksellers, is a hint of vanilla: “Lignin, which is present in all wood-based paper, is closely related to vanillin. >As it breaks down, the lignin grants old books that faint vanilla scent.” … etc. … etc. …\nHere other links:\nhttp://www.compoundchem.com/2014/06/01/newoldbooksmell/\n>…A study in 2009 looked into the smell of old books, finding that the complex scent was a mix of “hundreds of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released into the air from the paper,” says the Telegraph. …\nhttp://thescienceoffiction.net/tag/the-wonder-of-books/\n>… In total, there are hundreds of VOCs that can contribute to the overall scent of the book in question. However, there are several chemicals that can be both named and attributed to certain fragrances. One you might recognize is vanillin — the same chemical found in artificial vanilla. As you can guess, this contributes to the “hint of vanilla” mentioned by Strlič. A less familiar name (unless you took organic chemistry, or enjoy looking up chemical compounds) is 2-ethyl hexanol. This chemical offers a gentle floral scent. \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_14_dating_of_the_Shroud_of_Turin\n>…(Rogers) stated that: “The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300- and 3000-years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years”.[ = Raymond N. Rogers, 2004, Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin, TCA paper]\n>Rogers concluded from this that the Shroud is much older than the earlier purported estimates…\nhttps://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/page/5/\n>… However, there is another pitfall lurking here if Rogers thought that vanillin was a volatile material, going by the aroma from old wood.  That could conceal a major source of error if his sleeping partner, Dr. S.T.Kosiewicz of the title, was not aware of it. … etc. … etc. …\n>… while the nose can readily detect vanillin at exceedingly low concentrations in air, it’s in fact a white solid with a quite high melting point (82 degrees C).  So when Kosiewicz measured remaining “vanillin” (read coniferaldehyde) at 70 degrees C, he would have been measuring some of the vanillin end product that had failed to vaporise, still being a solid with low surface area.  But when he raised the temperature to 100 degrees, the vanillin would then be liquid, with a larger surface area, larger vapour pressure, and been able to escape more easily causing less interference in the measurement of remaining “lignin”. You see, the exponential nature of the reaction rate means that any small errors at the higher temperatures is likely to translate into major errors in estimating the tiny rates of decay under normal environmental temperature.\n>There’s an “if” here, namely  that Kosiewicz was measuring lignin by disappearance, using the Wiesner test, rather than some more specific test. But we are not told how he did his chemistry. Thus the title (and chief complaint) of this posting.

Chemometric regression modeling as well as classification studies were conducted on spectral data obtained with chili peppers and fabrics samples. Multivariate regression models known as partial least squares (PLS-1) were developed from the spectral data of alcoholic extracts of Habanero peppers. The developed regression models were used to predict the total capsaicinoids concentration of a set of unknown samples. The ability of the regression models to correctly predict the total capsaicinoids concentration of unknown samples was evaluated in terms of the root mean square error or prediction (RMSEP). The prediction ability of the models produced was found to be robust and stable over time and in the face of instrumental modifications. A near-infrared spectral database was developed from over 800 textile samples. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the diffuse near-infrared reflectance spectra from these commercially available textiles. The PCA models were combined together into a soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) in order to classify the samples according to fiber type. The samples in the study had no pretreatments. The discriminating power of these models was tested by creating validation sets within a given fiber type as well as attempting to classify samples into a category that they do not belong to. The apparent sub-class groupings within the same fiber class were investigated as to whether or not they were caused by chemical processing residues, multipurpose finishes, or dyes\n— — —\nI hope in other kind of analyses (see, for example, the investigations using the Chemical Force Microscopy)  in order to clarify the question …\nSo …\nWhat is your answer about the CFM way in comparison with the other ways ?\n\n","date":"January 23, 2014 at 9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/22/comment-promoted-are-the-quad-mosaics-meaningless/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted: Are the Quad Mosaics Meaningless?"},{"author":"piero","post":"I don’t agree about the enthusiasm around a new round of carbon dating.\n(B.T.W. : … from where we can take the linen sample ?

The deformation of such fibres induces a shift in the 1095 cm−1 Raman band, corresponding to the ring structure of the particular polymorph, which can be calibrated against strain. It is shown that this band shift can be used to monitor the deformation micromechanics of fibrous networks (cotton paper) and the composite micromechanics of single natural cellulose fibre unidirectional composites. The shear lag approach of Cox [Br. J. Appl. Phys. 3 (1952) 72] is investigated for the fibrous network and composite materials. For the network it is demonstrated that this theory does not apply since bonding across the end modifies the stress transfer by ‘shear-lag’. For the natural fibre composites it is thought that bonding occurs across the ends, also modifying this effect, but other possibilities are discussed in detail.\n— —\nAs you have read this work is far from the explanations about the mechanical\ntests by Giulio Fanti (who controlled the Modulus of Young  in direct and\nreverse cycle, loss factor and loss factor in reverse cycle, etc.), but\nyou can also think at possible other ways to investigate\nthe material (… and, if it is possible, in a nondestructive manner !).\nFor instance …\nin the previous messages (on this blog) I indicate the AFM\nthree point-bending tests.\nThen you can read (and see) what is illustrated under :\nhttp://www.tappi.org/content/events/08nano/papers/08nan22.pdf\nThe title of the presentation is the following :\nYoung’s Modulus of Cellulose Fibrils measured using Atomic Force Microscopy\nby\nSiqun Wang and Qingzheng Cheng,\nUniv. of Tennessee (2008)\n— —\nDo you know the bending deflections (and Structural Mechanics) ?\nWhat is the result from the measurement of\nthe elastic modulus (following that method) ?\n— —\nWhat is your opinion ?\nObserve the fibril lay on wafer and the fibril on groove …\nWhere is the best way to work ?\nPerhaps you can try (by yourself) using the extra-fine linen found\nin one of the pharaoh tombs !\nSome sources say that fine and even transparent linen apparels\nwere worn by Egyptian queens and it was revealed that the fine yarn\nwas obtained by enzymatic treatment of saliva (… in the human mouth !).\nI hope in your interesting observations …\n\n","date":"March 29, 2013 at 12:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/27/giulio-fanti-the-image-of-a-man-who-lived-between-280-bc-and-220-ad/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Giulio Fanti: The Image of a Man Who Lived Between 280 BC and 220 AD"},{"author":"piero","post":"First of all\nYou must read in the book (by Fanti and Gaeta) the interesting Chapter 3 :\n“Le datazioni alternative”\n= “The  alternative dating”\nThe three methods :\n– FTIR/ATR,\n– Raman,\n– mechanical dating\nare all well explained (for the public).\nThen, in my opinion, you can learn something of interest (for your studies\nabout the Holy Shroud of Turin) if you buy that new book.\nThere are also some words about the controls for an\ninteresting sample coming from Masada (radiocarbon dated) …\nthat sample was contaminated with CaCO3 (and then it was washed) …\nWell.\nUnder the optical controls numerous parameters of this sample\nseemed to be similar those of the samples taken from the Holy Shroud.\nBut the heat exposure for the samples of the Shroud … … ….\n                                      Please, read that book !\nI cannot copy for you (but see also [in this book] the copyright about\nthe statistical works by E.

Abundant information was gained over the years with these techniques, so that the evaporation of macroscopic drops of simple liquids from inert surfaces is nowadays well understood. The same techniques are, however, not applicable to microscopic drops. Furthermore they do not directly provide a measure of the interfacial stresses arising at the contact area between liquid and solid, which are known to play a key role in the evaporation kinetics of small drops.\n>Here I show how the use of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers as sensitive stress, mass, and temperature sensors can be employed to monitor the evaporation of microdrops of water. Starting drop diameters are always below 100 μm. The foremost interest lies in exploring the last stages of the evaporation process\nSee also :\nAtomic Force Microscope Cantilevers Used as Sensors for Monitoring Microdrop Evaporation\nElmar Bonaccurso, Dmytro S.

Similar techniques are, however, hardly applicable to microscopic drops. Moreover, they do not provide a measure of the interfacial stresses arising at the contact area between liquid and solid.\n>Here we demonstrate the use of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers as sensitive stress, mass, and temperature sensors for monitoring the evaporation of microdrops of water from solid surfaces.\n>Starting from considerations on drops in equilibrium, we will further discuss evaporating drops and details of the experimental technique. We will show how the evaporation of water microdrops on a hydrophobic surface differs from the evaporation on a hydrophilic surface, and how this difference becomes more pronounced towards the end of evaporation.\n>We further show that one-side metal-coated cantilevers, acting as bimetals, allow measuring the average temperature of an evaporating microdrop.\n>Finally, we will discuss two further applications of microdrops evaporating on cantilevers, namely testing the local cleanliness of cantilevers’ surfaces and calibrating cantilevers’ spring constants\n— — —\nPerhaps there is the possibility to do the controls about solutions of\nSaponaria officinalis (and then, see also : the behavior of Saponaria\non linen fibrils = concentration-evaporation phenomena, etc.) and/or starch\n(hot) solutions … or water …\nwith dissolved radioactive salts (… !?!?!?).\nSo … the possible next contamination from ukrainian nuclear reactors,\nduring the turmoils, is not an unsolved problem …\n… because under :\nhttp://www.ivanhoe.com/science/story/2011/08/896a.html\nWe can read :\n>… The earthquake in Japan raised an even bigger\nissue– radioactivity.

In this work, surface-enhanced\nRaman spectroscopy (SERS) was applied to\nthe analysis of textile fibers dyed with madder\nfrom two different botanical species, Oldenlandia\numbellata L. and Rubia tinctorum L.\n>The resulting SERS spectra were interpreted\nin light of the actual composition of the madder\ndyes as determined by high-performance liquid\nchromatography. Interestingly, the SERS spectra\nwere found to exhibit very distinctive spectral\nfeatures depending on the different anthraquinone\nderivatives present in the dyes. In particular, the\nSERS spectrum of O. umbellata L. was found to\nmatch the spectrum of alizarin, while the SERS\nspectrum of R. tinctorum L. was surprisingly\ndominated by signals due to the less studied\nanthraquinone compound pseudopurpurin.\n>With this study, we demonstrate that SERS spectra\nmay offer valuable information regarding the major\ncoloring constituents present in different madder species.\n>Moreover, our work shows that not only can SERS\nbe used successfully to differentiate among closely\nrelated anthraquinone derivatives, but also that\nthis technique is particularly suitable for the detection\nof pseudopurpurin, leading to the identification of\nthis compound in a number of works of art. \nCopyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n— —\nI want to add that I don’t believe\nthis interesting (but possible misleading …or mad?!?)\n“problem about investigation on madder”\n(this also in reference to “the madder-dyed\nShroud” by Adrie van Hoeven and to the\nprevious words by Louis:\n“…There is mention of the Harappan (Indus Valley\nCivilisation) custom of dyeing cloth and there\nseems to be evidence of dyeing with red madder…”)\nas the “main solving key” for Turin Shroud Enigma…\n\n","date":"October 8, 2015 at 9:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"piero","post":"Useful details for eventual absent minded readers\n(…or only a little bit distracted):\n100 mm squared divided by 0.42 mm squared =\n238.095\nand\n238.095 multiplied by 10 = 2380.95\n(presumed pollen grains)\nthat, rounded, are:\n2380 pollen per square centimeters!!!\n\n","date":"October 6, 2015 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/06/breaking-news-sources-of-dna-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science","title":"Breaking News:  Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"piero","post":"I hope you will forgive me for my previous work\non this topic “Sources of DNA on the Shroud of Turin”\nsince they were quite out of focus …\nAt the end of the Abstract (of “Uncovering the\nsources of DNA found on the Turin Shroud”),\npublished online (October 5, 2015), we can read:\n“… Furthermore the results raise the possibility of\nan Indian manufacture of the linen cloth.”\nInstead the book (At least, in the Italian edition\nthat I bought in date: March 8, 2014… Then,\nsee the Chapter 8: “Novità e futuri sviluppi” =\n“Novelties and future developments” …)\nof Prof. Eng.

Theaim of this paper is to attempt to combine physical and metaphysical intensity states forconsciousness. It is shown that widening of parapsychology to the solution of quantumconsciousness can be important in the explanation of paranormal phenomena. I have appliedequations in quantum mechanics to quantum consciousness. These equations can have twosolutions, one of which describes waves, energy and matter propagating from the past to thefuture and the other describes waves, energy and matter propagating from the future to the past. Working on the mathematical properties of the advanced solutions, mathematician LuigiFantappiè discovered in 1941 that they coincide with the qualities of living systems what theyare concentration of energy, differentiation, structures and order, thus arriving at the conclusionthat life, more than being effected by causes placed in the past, is attracted by causes placed inthe future. Therefore, the parameters of the autonomic nervous system, which supports vitalprocesses, should show anticipated reactions to future stimuli\nSee also in Wikipedia:\n>…  … This more developed version of their ideas was also widely attacked, and notably by the physicist Max Tegmark, who calculated that quantum states in microtubules would survive for only 10−13 seconds, too brief to be of any significance for neural processes.[6] Hameroff and the physicists Scott Hagan and Jack Tuszynski replied to Tegmark arguing that microtubules could be shielded against the environment of the brain.

It supports and ensures research collaboration between them by launching and managing different types of project calls. Within the EMRP Call 2012 “Metrology for Industry”, the joint research project (JRP) entitled “Multidimensional Reflectometry for Industry” (xD-Reflect) was submitted by a consortium of 8 National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and 2 universities and was subsequently funded. The general objective of xD-Reflect is to meet the demands from industry to describe the overall macroscopic appearance of modern surfaces by developing and improving methods for optical measurements which correlate with the visual sensation being evoked. In particular, the project deals with the “Goniochromatism”, “Gloss” and “Fluorescence” properties of dedicated artifacts, which will be investigated in three main work packages (WP). Two additional transversal WP reinforce the structure: “Modelling and Data Analysis” with the objective to give an irreducible set of calibration schemes and handling methods and “Visual Perception”, which will produce perception scales for the different visual attributes. Multidimensional reflectometry involves the enhancement of spectral and spatial resolution of reference gonioreflectometers for BRDF measurements using modern detectors, conoscopic optical designs, CCD cameras, line scan cameras, and modern light sources in order to describe new effects like sparkle and graininess/coarseness.\nMore information and updated news concerning the project can be found on the xD-Reflect website http://www.xdreflect.eu/ .\n— —\nSome explanation about the word “Goniochromatism”:\n= The phenomenon where the color of a material changes as the angle of illumination and/or viewing is changed.

When an interference pigment is coated on a white surface, he reflection color is seen in the highlight and the transmission color in the background. The variations in color with the angle of incidence and the angle of observations is referred to as goniochromatism. Hence the color one sees when looking at a goniochromatic layer varies with changes in angular position relative to this layer. … … …\n— —\nThen see also my past message\nsent in December 20, 2013 at 10:50 am \n>… … I have known the luster of linen fibrils.\nAl Adler pointed the finger on presumed “bioplastic coating”\n(“… he seems to be unaware that all linen looks like this.

Dokukin and Igor Sokolov \nAbstract\n>The modulus of elasticity of soft materials on the nanoscale is of interest when studying thin films, nanocomposites, and biomaterials. Two novel modes of atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been introduced recently: HarmoniX and PeakForce QNM. Both modes produce distribution maps of the elastic modulus over the sample surface. Here we investigate the question of how quantitative these maps are when studying soft materials. Three different polymers with a macroscopic Young’s modulus of 0.6–0.7 GPa (polyurethanes) and 2.7 GPa (polystyrene) are analyzed using these new modes. The moduli obtained are compared to the data measured with the other commonly used techniques, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), regular AFM, and nanoindenter. We show that the elastic modulus is overestimated in both the HarmoniX and PeakForce QNM modes when using regular sharp probes because of excessively overstressed material in the samples. We further demonstrate that both AFM modes can work in the linear stress–strain regime when using a relatively dull indentation probe (starting from ∼210 nm). The analysis of the elasticity models to be used shows that the JKR model should be used for the samples considered here instead of the DMT model, which is currently implemented in HarmoniX and PeakForce QNM modes. Using the JKR model and∼240 nm AFM probe in the PeakForce QNM mode, we demonstrate that a quantitative mapping of the elastic modulus of polymeric materials is possible. A spatial resolution of ∼50 nm and a minimum 2 to 3 nm indentation depth are achieved.\nLink:\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la302706b\nAs you already know, the measurements on the modulus of elasticity\n(= Young’s modulus) are useful for determining the probable\nage (= probable epoch) of the material…\n— — —\nIf we have to go beyond the known informations on\n“Compatibility between Shroud of Oviedo and the Holy Shroud”,\nthen we must use the right tools (= AFM techniques, IMO) and compare\nboth linen materials (using the adequate AFM apparels\n[= microscopes that permit other controls, for example:\nAFM-Raman analyses, etc. …]).\nHave you understood what is the situation ?\nThen …\nNow I hope in your interesting replies!\n— —\nHere antoher reference:\nAtomic Force Microscopy Techniques for Nanomechanical Characterization: A Polymeric Case Study\nby\nMelania Reggente, Marco Rossi, Livia Angeloni, Emanuela Tamburri, Massimiliano Lucci, Ivan Davoli, Maria Letizia Terranova, Daniele Passeri\nAbstract\n>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a versatile tool to perform mechanical characterization of surface samples at the nanoscale. In this work, we review two of such methods, namely contact resonance AFM (CR-AFM) and torsional harmonics AFM (TH-AFM). First, such techniques are illustrated and their applicability on materials with elastic moduli in different ranges are discussed, together with their main advantages and limitations. Then, a case study is presented in which we report the mechanical characterization using both CR-AFM and TH-AFM of polyaniline and polyaniniline doped with nanodiamond particles tablets prepared by a pressing process. We determined the indentation modulus values of their surfaces, which were found in fairly good agreement, thus demonstrating the accuracy of the techniques. Finally, the determined surface elastic moduli have been compared with the bulk ones measured through standard indentation testing.\nIn any case: polyaniline and polyaniniline are not cellulosic chains on linen fibrils!…\n\n","date":"May 7, 2015 at 8:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/06/cis-conference-program/","cat":"conference","title":"CIS Conference Program"},{"author":"piero","post":"Errata corrige:\n>only particular (and interesting) questions \ninstead of:\nonly a particular (and interesting) questions\n\n","date":"May 6, 2015 at 10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/06/cis-conference-program/","cat":"conference","title":"CIS Conference Program"},{"author":"piero","post":"Here a strange question (and you can try to answer):\nWhat has to do with the Shroud (and our friend\nJohn Klotz!) the recent (and further) evidence for\nthe existence of pentaquarks?\nLarge Hadron Collider discovers new pentaquark particle.\n>Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider have announced\nthe discovery of a new particle called the pentaquark.\n>It was first predicted to exist in the 1960s but, much\nlike the Higgs boson particle before it, the pentaquark\neluded science for decades until its detection at the LHC.\n>The discovery, which amounts to a new form of matter,\nwas made by the Hadron Collider’s LHCb experiment. …\nLink:\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-33517492\nHere an old evidence:\n>July 21, 2003–At the Conference on the Intersections of\nParticle and Nuclear Physics held May 2003 in New York City,\nresearcher Stepan Stepanyan from the DOE Office of\nScience’s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility\nrevealed the most convincing evidence yet of a subatomic\nparticle consisting of five quarks.\n>He was representing his CLAS (CEBAF Large Acceptance\nSpectrometer) collaboration, a multi-national group of\nresearchers, as he presented Jefferson Lab research\nsupporting the existence of the “pentaquark.”\nCEBAF–Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility–is an\nOffice of Science national user facility managed and\noperated by Jefferson Laboratory. … …\nLink:\nhttp://www.eurekalert.org/features/doe/2003-07/djna-pne080103.php\n— —\nWas the Corpse transformed in “new form of matter”?\nI don’t believe in that strange idea, but I would\nto deepen around the question of the …”new form of matter”…\nand the “Sign of the Shroud”…\n\n","date":"July 14, 2015 at 11:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/14/does-it-matter-if-the-shroud-is-a-fake/","cat":"presentation","title":"Does it Matter if the Shroud is a Fake?"},{"author":"piero","post":"You wrote: “I tend to see the resurrected body as\nmade up of an entirely different as yet unknown kind\nof matter, existing in a different universe, of which\nour own universe may be a subset. …”\nIt’s an interesting idea.\nBut a bit heretic, IMO…\nAn “unknown kind of matter” seems to be too limited\n(with respect to the infinite power of God…) about the\nfinal transformation for the Corpse/Body.\nAlso the resurrection in “another universe” (“multiverse”?)\nseem to be a sort of mocking result… because this new universe\ncan be uncomprehensible for us.

While the exine\nis composed of sporopollenin, a complex and highly resistant\nbiopolymer containing fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics\nand carotenoids, the intine is largely composed of pectin and cellulose. …\n— —\nNow the problem :\nHow can change over the centuries the material of pollen?\n— —\nA previous Boi’s report (Valencia 2012) clearly highlights that the pollen\nis proof that the shroud, which is kept in Turin, was a winding-sheet and was used according to rituals common in the Middle East over a thousand years ago.\nB.T.W. : Under the address :\nhttp://extension.uned.es/actividad/7018\nI have found another work by Marzia Boi (Universitat de les Illes Balears),\nhere the title : “Sábana Santa de Turín y Sudario de Oviedo: pruebas científicas\ndel crimen de Jesús de Nazaret”.\nSo …\nIf Max Frei made no attempt to distinguish between anemophilous and\nentomophilous pollen material, meanwhile, forensic science has progressed.\nIn my previous intervention I remembered that is important to record the nature of pollen grains, the we were not able to deepen the question…\nIf the pollen grains are powdery, dust like, this is an indication about wind pollination.\nUsually pollen grains are sticky in insect pollinated flowers.\nSo we have to control what are the levels of viscoelasticity and adhesion …\nI have several doubts about the precision of that control,\nafter the centuries and aging…\nIn my opinion that work is not a nonsensical control and\nI am still curious about that unsolved question.\n4 – In my opinion Giulio Fanti author of the intervention :\nOptical features of flax fibers coming from the Turin Shroud\nwas able to do something using PLM (= Polarized Light Microscopy)\nand not with SPM …\nBut I am still curious to follow what are the interesting observations.\nFor now we can imagine something.\nFor example:\nit is possible to show something about the ancient treatment\n= the beaten linen fibrils observed in optical field (PLM) …\nor :\nWas he able to measure the Viscoelastic Properties\nthrough “calibrated optical observations” ?\nNow remains a curiosity for what we still need to know…\n5 – At the end there are the studies about the strange EQLs\nand Earthquakes …\n= Sky Darkening during Strong Earthquakes as Hypothesis of\nEarth’s Crust Emission in Holy Shroud Image Study.\nSee, for example, what wrote Fidani :\n>A seven-month collection of testimonials about the 6 April 2009 earthquake in Aquila, Abruzzo region, Italy, was compiled into a catalogue of non-seismic phenomena.

Alejandro Pezet was saying Holy Mass at a Catholic church in the commercial center of Buenos Aires. As he was finishing distributing Holy Communion, a woman came up to tell him that she had found a discarded host on a candleholder at the back of the church. On going to the spot indicated, Fr. Alejandro saw the defiled Host. Since he was unable to consume it, he placed it in a container of water and put it away in the tabernacle of the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament.\nOn Monday, August 26, upon opening the tabernacle, he saw to his amazement that the Host had turned into a bloody substance. He informed Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, who gave instructions that the Host be professionally photographed. The photos were taken on September 6. They clearly show that the Host, which had become a fragment of bloodied flesh, had grown significantly in size. For several years the Host remained in the tabernacle, the whole affair being kept a strict secret. Since the Host suffered no visible decomposition, Cardinal Bergoglio decided to have it scientifically analyzed.\n>On October 5, 1999, in the presence of the Cardinal’s representatives, Dr. Castanon took a sample of the bloody fragment and sent it to New York for analysis. Since he did not wish to prejudice the study, he purposely did not inform the team of scientists of its provenance. One of these scientists was Dr. Frederic Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], the well-known cardiologist and forensic pathologist. He determined that the analyzed substance was real flesh and blood containing human DNA. … …\n>… ..Two Australians, journalist Mike Willesee and lawyer Ron Tesoriero, witnessed these tests. Knowing where sample had come from, they were dumbfounded by Dr. Zugiba’s testimony. Mike Willesee asked the scientist how long the white blood cells would have remained alive if they had come from a piece of human tissue, which had been kept in water. They would have ceased to exist in a matter of minutes, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied. The journalist then told the doctor that the source of the sample had first been kept in ordinary water for a month and then for another three years in a container of distilled water; only then had the sample been taken for analysis. Dr. Zugiba’s was at a loss to account for this fact. There was no way of explaining it scientifically, he stated. Only then did Mike Willesee inform Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!] that the analyzed sample came from a consecrated Host (white, unleavened bread) that had mysteriously turned into bloody human flesh. Amazed by this information, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied, “How and why a consecrated Host would change its character and become living human flesh and blood will remain an inexplicable mystery to science—a mystery totally beyond her competence.”\nDr. F. Zugibe was a well known sindonologist…\nLink:\nhttp://www.loamagazine.org/nr/the_main_topic/eucharistic_miracle_in_buenos.html\n>a journalist reported that miracles had been more than one.

Rogers and Anna Arnoldi\n>… Postmortem body temperatures can reach 41ºC (Irvine, 2001), and steep temperature gradients would exist across the cloth as a result of the low thermal diffusivity of linen and theangular dependence of radiant heat flow from a nonmetallic surface (Gubareff et al, 1960).\nThen they concluded that temperature gradients will have a large effect\non Maillard reaction rates and these combination of factors could produce\na distribution of reaction products with the appearance of the image.\nI have pointed out (but a bit in a bad way. Sorry…) the question of urea.\nIn short, I wanted to underline that the cadaveric amines\n(= putrescine and cadaverine, etc.) are the main candidates\n(if I am right in my readings) for the famous Maillard reaction\nindicated by Rogers and Arnoldi (and then we have to see what is\nthe possible role for urea).\nLink:\nin https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers7.pdf.\n>Ever since the French chemist Louis-Camille Maillard studied the metabolism of urea and kidney illnesses and published his thesis on the actions of glycerin and sugar on amino acids in 1913, the Maillard reaction has been a hot research topic. A review on browning reactions in dehydrated foods, which appeared in the first volume of Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, remains the most-cited paper in that journal’s history. \nLink:\nhttp://blog.khymos.org/2012/06/04/maximizing-food-flavor-by-speeding-up-the-maillard-reaction/\nHere what wrote Thibault Heimburger:\n>…Much has been made of ammonia being produced from sweat by hydrolysis of urea (H2NCONH2).\n>CO2 (and some carbamates) is the other final product. I have not been able to find any sweat analysesthat showed urea as a major component. In any case, the reaction would be over in a few hours.Ammonia would leave a fog of color on the cloth, because it diffuses quite rapidly.\n>The image was notprimarily formed by ammonia. The fog around the nose and mouth looks to me like some ammonia was involved (“I think I see”).\n— — —\nI believe you have to read the document:\nby Ray Schneider\nhttp://www.shrouduniversity.com/Handouts/LLI-Shroud-Pt4-Skeptics&Image.pdf\nHere what is explained in the document\n(at p 59 of 65) by Ray Schneider:\n“Coronal Discharge”\nProfessor Giulio Fanti believes that coronal discharge\ncould explain the shroud image.\n– Giulio has done a lot of good science\n– Coronal Discharge requires very high voltages\n-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-\nAnd, at the end, some words about the strange theories…\nSee for example:\n\nHere the words by Prof. Gonella during Villa Gualino’s Meeting (in 2000):\n“…As for the neutron bombardment, skipping any comment on the weird idea of a nuclear physics of Resurrection, as a nuclear physicist I can assure you that the exposure of cellulose to a fast neutron fluence big enough to cause the required enrichment in 14C would play such a havoc with the hydrogen atoms to cause chemical changes visible to the naked eye (and this too can be easily checked). …”\nHere the words by Prof. Luigi Gonella\n(title = “Discussant’s contribution”)\nduring the famous Meeting in Villa Gualino, Turin (in 2000):\n“…As for the neutron bombardment, skipping any comment on the weird idea of a nuclear physics of Resurrection, as a nuclear physicist I can assure you that the exposure of cellulose to a fast neutron fluence big enough to cause the required enrichment in 14C would play such a havoc with the hydrogen atoms to cause chemical changes visible to the naked eye (and this too can be easily checked). …”\nSo…\nIt’s easily understandable that my old idea (written by myself in my intervention paper for Dallas 2005) to use the AFM controls and the SSNTD witnesses during adequate experimental simulations perhaps should have had also this reference (… thinkable as an authoritative reference) in the paper (a simple thing that I didn’t do, if I well remember…)… otherwise that idea was judged a simple and useless joke (and now I write this with reference what wrote Prof. Gonella).\nUnfortunately we have seen some recent interesting or strange papers (an example: Jeffrey Skurka…) where this argument  (= AFM sperimental controls on irradiated samples with SSNTD as material witnesses regarding nuclear radiations) do not appear.\nIn any case, the Cellulose itself is a good detector (for exactness : a cellulose derivative = Cellulose nitrate).\n\n","date":"March 27, 2015 at 10:49

are present on the surface of the linen fibers of the cloth) and then give the Maillard products.\nThe possession of a dipole moment permits direct interaction with electric fields or interaction with

It was found that while the track and damage openings could be similar in size and shape, the depths for the damages were consistently smaller.

(B.T.W.: Do you know these granules ?)\nIn any case my name is not connected with Fanti, Botella, Di Lazzaro,\nHeimburger and Svensson. Yes, the study “Microscopic and Macroscopic Characteristics of the Shroud of Turin Image Superficiality” was an interesting attempt,\nbut that work was not careful (speaking from the point of view of Textile Chemistry and Applied Microscopy …). So, I remained aloof from that “inconsistent work” (Sorry…\nHere no offence or personal affront !) claiming something without the required proofs (because they don’t used the advanced Microscopies = AFM, CFM …).\nHave you read the book : “Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood”\n(2001) by Oliver Sacks ?\nIt is an autobiographical account of his early life in a family where curiosity and inquisitiveness were encouraged.\nReading a page of  this book we found the interesting comment about\nthe discovery of the vision for the true atoms with\nthe (Tungsten) tip of an Atomic Force Microscopy.\nWell…\nWhy I have cited Oliver Sacks ?\nIn 1998 I wrote about AFM (as a method to control the truth about the samples from the Shroud, see also : the 14C tests of 1988)\nwithout the support of true controls, a forewarning with a vague image from the University of Pisa.\nInstead Ray Rogers indicated another kind of approach : ESCA (= Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis), in the paper “An Alternate Hypothesis for the Image Color”.\nBut he pretty convincingly established the fact of a thin layer of starch impurities on the surface of the fibers.\nSo… We have to show that presence (of starch) using the modern tools and\nthat (perhaps) was not well appreciated by Fanti & other researchers.\nTheses guys (with all due respect to their academic qualifications)\npointed the finger mainly toward the primary cell wall…\nPerhaps they are not familiar with the different properties of\nthe different fractions of starch.\nSo… What is your opinion ?\nWhen tested with iodine, normal soluble starch turns blue.\nStarch that is soluble only in hot water turns red.\nDo you agree on that information ?\nFor example:\nI have read that erythrodextrin can be distinguished from\nother carbohydrates by its red color reaction with iodine.\nAnd I have found another information:\n>Starch is converted to erythro-dextrin and dextrose by\nboiling with dilute mineral acids.\nIf the boiling is prolonged the erythro-dextrin is converted to dextrose…\nSource:\nhttp://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/Exercises_in_Practical_Physiological_Chemistry_1000245717/45\n[Exercises in Practical Physiological Chemistry by Sydney William Cole, 1927]\nThere are three kinds of dextrins :\namylo-, erythro- and achro-;\nthe amylo- and erythro-dextrins giving a red or brownish colour\nwith iodine solution, the achro-dextrin being unaffected by this reagent.\nFrom Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrin )\nwe know that :\n>Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight  carbohydrates\nproduced by the hydrolysis of starch …\nIn any case Rogers indicated us that higher-molecular-weight,\nhot-water-soluble starch is the last to wash out of a cloth\nand the reaction with iodine produces a red color…\nWhere are the colored photomicrograph of red fibers ?\nHave you seen the interesting images ?\nHave you found the useful chemical proofs?\nAre you able to send us inherent pictures ?\nIn your study there are no images…\nWhy ?\nI believe that Colin Berry is able to show us the red fibers…\nAm I wrong in my idea ?\nHow to estimate the exact composition of thin layers on linen fibrils ?\nIs it possible to control the famous “ghosts” using non-destructive analyses ?\n— —\nNow I want to speak about my doubts about the quantity\n(and distribution) of cadaveric gases involved into\nthe scenario proposed by Arnoldi and Rogers …\nIMO Rogers was an able thermochemist but (although he\nclaimed the Maillard reaction as solution for\nthe problem) he was not able to solve the Enigma\nwith a incontrovertible and credible experiment\n(B.T.W. : DETA is not a natural amine !).\n— —\nYesterday I have read the acronym DC-STE\n(DC= Direct Contact, STE = Sorptive Tape Extraction ).\nIf you try with Google using that acronym probably you will find few or nothing…\nBut there is a method based on direct contact sorptive tape extraction followed by on-line thermal desorption gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (DC-STE–GC–MS) to detect and quantify a group of suspected volatile allergens …\nSo, the exact acronym is not DC-STE, but DC-STE–GC–MS…\nWhere are the useful works?\nI have read something, but they were far from the resolution of the Shroud …\n— — —\nPutrescine and Cadaverine.\nRelated compounds that are both produced\nby the breakdown of amino acids in living\nand dead organisms.\nThe two compounds are largely responsible\nfor the foul odor of putrefying flesh.\nBut …\nWhere are the measurements (= measurements about\nthe exact amount of cadaveric emissions from the corpses) ?\nUntil

An application for which it has received growing interest is in the analysis of paint cross-sections. However, FTIR microscope configurations, objectives’ geometries and low spatial resolutions, and issues of sample preparation have often hampered the characterization of individual layers or features in cross-sections. With the use of case studies, it is demonstrated here that an ATR-FTIR microscope featuring a crystal of optimized geometry and a viewing capability feature allows characterization of individual layers, or areas within layers, of 10 μm thickness or less in single measurements. Of particular value is a remote aperturing feature which allows the analysis of selected areas within the contact footprint of the ATR crystal. Since the technique is non-destructive, the same area can be analyzed by complementary microscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was also used in some cases to corroborate the spectroscopic data. The analyses presented provided data which were important in informing art historical interpretation and conservation of the artworks examined\nLink:\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00216-008-2064-2#\n2- ATR-FTIR imaging for the analysis of organic materials in paint cross sections: case studies on paint samples from the National Gallery, London\nMarika Spring, Camilla Ricci, David A.

The first case furnished the following value = 1”, 98 + 0”,30 and the second indicated 1”,61+0”,30.\nBut in 1923 William Wallace Campbell and Robert Julius Trurmper , published an article where the prevision of General Relativity (by Einstein) about stellar light deflection due to the mass of Sun were compared with a group of measurements taken during a total eclipse of Sun that happened in September 21, 1922.\nThe theretical value foreseen by General Relativity was 1″,745, instead the experimental mean value found was equal to 1″,72 +/- 0″,11. Then the comparison turned to be a strong confirmation for the theorical value.\nHere few other lines (History of Science): early calculations done by EInstein in 1911 indicated a deflection value of 0″,87 (in 1911, Einstein wrote: “A ray of light going past the Sun would accordingly undergo deflexion to an amount of 4×10-6 = 0.83 seconds of arc.”), then a value near identical of that indicated in 1801 by Johann Georg von Soldner (1776-1833), a scientist who remained in the field of the Newton’s theory and also hypothesized that light was an heavy body subject to the diffusion from the solar mass.\nBut in 1915 the newtonian idea was replaced by arguments based on space’s curvature and the estimation flowed into a value twice (= 1″,74) with respect the previous data .\nUnfortunately in 1914 and in 1916 there was the war period and in 1918 an attempt achieved by american researchers did not produced a sufficient amount of data … \nThat is: at the end we must remember the famous phrase… “Carthago delenda est” !…\nLink:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity\nPlease, read the similar words under the paragraph: “Deflection of light by the Sun”:\n>… The first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere. The observations were performed in May 1919 by Arthur Eddington and his collaborators during a total solar eclipse,[12] so that the stars near the Sun could be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil and in São Tomé and Príncipe on the west coast of Africa.[13] The result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers. It made Einstein and his theory of general relativity world-famous. When asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by Eddington and Dyson in 1919, Einstein famously made the quip: “Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway.” . …\n… and then now my hands are almost burning for impatience!\nBut I have found another link:\nhttp://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/eclipse/index.html\nWhere we can read the following words:\n>In “Weird but True” Jamal Munshi reports: “Dr. F. Schmeidler of the Munich University Observatory has published a paper titled “The Einstein Shift An Unsettled Problem,” and a plot of shifts for 92 stars for the 1922 eclipse shows shifts going in all directions, many of them going the wrong way by as large a deflection as those shifted in the predicted direction! Further examination of the 1919 and 1922 data originally interpreted as confirming relativity, tended to favor a larger shift, the results depended very strongly on the manner for reducing the measurements and the effect of omitting individual stars.\n>So now we find that the legend of Albert Einstein as the world’s greatest scientist was based on the Mathematical Magic of Trimming and Cooking of the eclipse data to present the illusion that Einstein’s general relativity theory was correct in order to prevent Cambridge University from being disgraced because one of its distinguished members [Eddington] was close to being declared a “conscientious objector”.  … …\nSo we should conclude that a certain amount of tricks seems to be necessary to work with succeed in the field of Science…\nand the claim of that webpage is that they\n(= P. Marmet and C. Couture, Physics Department, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada) have shown “that no one can seriously claim that light is really deflected by the Sun.” !!!\nReally ???\nand I have found another webpage, by V.N.

This technique was successfully employed to determine the hydrated thickness of a series of crosslinked tetraglyme coatings on ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene substrates intended to reduce wear of acetabular cups in total hip replacements. The hydrated coatings ranged from 30 to 200 nm thick and were accurately measured despite the relatively high root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the substrates, 20-35 nm (peak-to-peak roughness 55-100 nm). The calibrated ATR-FTIR technique is a promising new method for measuring the thickness of many other polymer-on-polymer and hydrated coatings.\nSo…\nIt should also be a curious method to work considering the fact\nthat (in absolute) AFM (= atomic force microscopy) controls\nhave more resolution than ATR-FTIR controls…\n— —\nThe reader from Palo Alto wrote:\n>You and your blog mates are being unfair to Dr. Colin Berry.\n>As I see it he is the real successor to Raymond Rogers.\nDr. Raymond Rogers claimed to be able to work using the petrographic\nmicroscope (…then, unless Steven D.

However, that changed on September 9, 1915, when the famous scientist Nikola Tesla published an article entitled The Wonder World to be Created by Electricity. In it, he made the following astounding claim:\n…Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely and minutely arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high tension discharge…\nThe term condenser is an older word for what we now know as a capacitor, or an electrical machine capable of storing energy. Tesla thought that the Ark generated static electricity by causing air to rub against curtains. This created static electricity which was then stored inside the Ark, turning the box into a giant Leyden Jar.\nSource:\nhttp://www.guerrillaexplorer.com/strange-science/ark-of-the-covenant-lost-technology/\n2)\n>… after his escape from Egypt, Moses ordered the construction of the Ark of the Covenant to house the tablets of stone on which were written the original “Ten Commandments”. Its construction is described in great detail in the book of Exodus and according to the Bible and Jewish legend it was endowed with miraculous powers including emitting sparks and fire and striking dead Aaron’s sons and others who touched it. It was basically a wooden box of acacia wood lined with gold and also overlaid on the outside with gold. The lid was decorated with two “cherubim” with outstretched wings. In 1915 Nikola Tesla, in an essay entitled “The Fairy Tale of Electricity” promoting the appreciation of electrical developments, proposed what seemed a plausible explanation for some of the magical powers of the Ark. He claimed that the gold sheaths separated by the dry acacia wood effectively formed a large capacitor on which a static electrical charge could be built up by friction from the curtains around the Ark and this accounted for the sparks and the electrocution of Aaron’s sons.\n>Recent calculations have shown however that the capacitance of the box would be in the order of 200 pico farads and such a capacitor would need to be charged to 100,000 volts to store even 1 joule of electrical energy, not nearly enough to cause electrocution. It seems Tesla’s explanation was appropriately named.\nSource: http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm\nSo…\nWas the Ark of the Covenant a mysterious biblical piece of ancient technology ?\nWhat was the level of electrical knowledge in ancient times?\nNow we can read something about ancient technology :\nnew technology to explore the ancient Greek Antikythera wreck in the Agean Sea, using an exosuit developed by Nuytco Research.\nThere is the amazing technology of the EXOSUIT atmospheric diving system (ADS)\n[links : http://nuytco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Exosuit-Specifications.pdf\nor :   http://nuytco.com/media/in-the-news/\nor   http://phys.org/news/2014-06-exosuit-explore-ancient-antikythera.html ]\nand then I hope that they are able to find other interesting proofs because:\n>The team has scheduled a test run of the suit this summer at a site called the Canyons off the coast of Rhode Island.

Hildebrand (who laid the foundation for solubility theory in his classic work on the solubility of nonelectrolytes in 1916) proposed the square root of the cohesive energy density as a numerical value indicating the solvency behavior of a specific solvent.\nlink:\nhttp://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/burke/solpar/solpar2.html\nThen Hildebrand solubility parameter for a pure liquid substance is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density.\nHere I presume you know the heat of vaporization,\nV(index m) = the molar volume, RT (from the Ideal Gas law\n[Liter atm / mole K] * K = [L atm / mol] )\nand the energy of vaporization….\nThe partial pressures of all of the components in a mixture of real gases depend\non the types of molecules and the temperature. At constant temperature,\nthe internal energy of a mixture remains constant; however,\nthe partial pressures of the components depend on their “fugacity.”\nIn any case we can expect that the chemical researchers are able to work using the IGC …\nUnfortunately Rogers passed away in 2005.\nI can recommand you to read a polish paper (in english) published in 2008:\n“Inverse gas chromatography as a source of physiochemical data”\n(read, at the end of this message, the bibliographic reference)\nbecause IGC could be called a milestone in testing properties\nof liquid and solid materials.\nTypical units are hildebrand :\n1 hildebrand = (1 cal )^1/2 (1 cm)^-3/2 = 0.48888 (Mega Pascal)^1/2 \nThe conventional units for the solubility parameter are (calories per cm3)^1/2, or: (cal)^1/2 (cm)^−3/2.\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildebrand_solubility_parameter\nSee also :\nHildebrand’s delta.\nHildebrand solubility parameter is also known as three-dimensional solubility parameters or HSP because Hansen proposed an extension of the Hildebrand parameter\nin order to estimate relative miscibility of polar and hydrogen bonding systems.\nThere is a formula to calculate the distance (Ra) between Hansen parameters in Hansen space.\nCombining this with the interaction radius gives the relative energy difference (RED) of the system (the ratio Ra/R0, where R0 is a value called interaction radius that is given to the substance being dissolved).\nHistorically Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) have been used in industries such as paints and coatings where understanding and controlling solvent/polymer interactions was vital. Over the years their use has been extended widely… \nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansen_solubility_parameter\nFor molecules whose heats of vaporization can be measured (… or calculated) one can determine the value of delta.\nThere are three delta components (Hansen evaluation system):\n– dispersion\n– electrostatic\n– hydrogen bonding \nDo you know HSP (= Hansen Solubility Parameters) for myrrhoaloetic oils ?\nPerhaps you can try to do some easily experiments using methane or propane gas\nin your cooling room (both are explosive gases when mixed with air: warning, take care!!!).\n— —\nI have read that:\nthe retention volume is calculated from the retention time\nand the partial pressure from the peak/step height.\nSince the retention volume represents the first derivation of the adsorbed amount,\nintegration gives the isotherm.\nPerhaps other bloggers can contribute\ndeveloping this argument…\n— —\nAs previously wrote I don’t believe in oil’s presence.\nYears ago I have read something about an\n“Unguentum Apostolorum”.\nAn oily, viscous substance, indicated by Norma Weller (now a deceased researcher),\nwho also wrote something about an archaeological expert in ancient forms of burial and embalming…\nIGC can be employed to explore changes in surface energy\n(see, for example : Corona Discharge treatments, etc. …)\nIGC became very popular method for the measurement\nof physico-chemical properties of solid materials.\nTherefore Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC), at infinite dilution, can be used\nto determine thermodynamic parameters of adsorption, such as free energy, enthalpy\nand entropy, as well as the dispersion component of surface free energy,\nand the interaction parameter.\nThen Inverse Gas Chromatography can be an useful tool to use\nin the case of experiments about thymol treatments (see: the inherent old claims)…\nI am curious to see what happens with natural linen samples, natural treated linen\nand modern/commercial linen samples. Perhaps they should show a smaller surface energy\ndue to the additional treating ingredients and processing methods…\nIn any case, I hope in your interesting answers…\n—————————— \nBibliographic references :\n– D.R.

Lineros\nApril 14, 2015\narxiv:1504.03261\nunder the address:\nhttps://www.dmhunters.org/?p=12252\n>Recently Blum, Katz and Waxman have claimed that the flux of high energy cosmic ray (CR) positrons near Earth that has been measured with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) aboard the International Space Station can be produced in the collisions of Galactic CR protons and nuclei with the ambient matter in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM).Their claim was based on an alleged “robust upper limit to the positron flux” which neglected the energy loss of e+’s in the ISM. Inclusion of this energy loss, however, yields a much smaller upper limit, which excludes secondary production in the ISM by the Galactic cosmic rays as the main origin of the CR e^+ flux above 10 GeV.\n— — —\nThe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a state-of-the-art particle physics detector designed to operate as an external module on the International Space Station. It will use the unique environment of space to study the universe and its origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter while performing precision measurements of cosmic rays composition and flux. The AMS-02 observations will help answer fundamental questions, such as “What makes up the universe’s invisible mass?” or “What happened to the primordial antimatter?”\n— —\nThen AMS and AFM are the two different ways to know this World…\nB.T.W., here what I have found in a new health field:\n>Nanodentistry is an emerging field with significant potential to yield new generation of technologically advanced clinical tools and devices for oral healthcare. Nanoscale topology and quantitative biomechanical or biophysical analysis of dental surfaces are of significant interest. In particular, using Atomic force microscopy techniques—diseases such as dental caries, tooth hypersensitivity, and oral cancer can be quantified based on morphological, biophysical and biochemical nanoscale properties of tooth surface itself and dental materials or oral fluids such as saliva. An outlook on future “nanodentistry” developments such as saliva exosomes based diagnostics, designing biocompatible, antimicrobial dental implants and personalized dental healthcare is presented…\nDon’t you want to think to improve the health?\nSee also Dr. Childérick Severac of ITAV, Toulouse, with his AFM system…\nunder the address:\nhttp://newsletter.jpk.com/2015/6gd1/row/nw-toulouse.htm?redir=no\n>…In the collaborative research efforts, AFM is being used to probe the mechanical properties of various cells, e.g. cancer cells, to study their invasiveness. …\n— — —\nNow I want to leave alone for a moment the technique\nand then I jump on the question of studies on Early Christianity:\nIn my opinion there are many points of the events of 2000 years ago that are a little unclear.\nFor example: Our Lord Jesus Christ had a foster father: St. Joseph. However: where is the tomb of St. Joseph? Recently I read a short service on the ancient cult of St. Joseph in Palestine. Along with the article was a picture of the so-called Tomb of the Right or of St. Joseph (which exists at the convent of the Sisters of Nazareth), the text was also quoted an ancient document called Judeo-Christian “Historia Josepi”.\nAccording to this ancient report the death and glorification of St. Joseph took place right in the place where according to tradition Jesus revealed his “secret doctrine”, ie on Mount Olivet …\nThe Dominican Milan IsidoroIsolano inserted the History of St. Joseph in his “Summa de donis St. Joseph”, printed in Pavia, in 1522. And in that work the story of Joseph’s life is attributed to Jesus himself, who would confided to the disciples on the Mount of Olives.\nIsidoroIsolano, who wrote the Summa of the gifts of St. Joseph, said that there will come a time when you will discover riches enclosed in St. Joseph.\nThe Gospel of St. Matthew informs us that the death of Christ, “the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints who had died, resurrected. Coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many “… So: St. Joseph was among them?\nAnother question: the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother of Jesus, is seen by some as the dying and then resurrected and went to heaven. Others (here I refer to one of the many responses given by Our Lady in Medjugorje) seem to deny that Mary is dead!\nThen: the Blessed Virgin Mary was dead or simply “asleep”?\nSome theologians, although the precise address expressed years ago by Pope Wojtyla, seems still debating the issue …\n— — —\nAfter these notes, however, I would not be passed to a heretic …\nSt. Joseph by the unanimous opinion of the theologians and the teaching of Blessed Pius IX (Decree Quemadmodum Deus, December 8, 1870), Leo XIII (enciclicaQuamquam pluries, August 15, 1889) and Pius XI (speech of 21 April 1926) exceeds dignity in any other saint of the Old and New Testament Baptist (though John the Baptist died a martyr, shedding his blood, and therefore there is no comparison) and Apostles included. Make faith the true marriage of St. Joseph with the Blessed Virgin Mary, the high paternity exercised against Jesus Christ, the extraordinary mission leader and guardian of the Holy Family, unsurpassed participation and knowledge of the divine plan of salvation\nI don’t put myself against the Truth of the Faith, but I see that some mysteries still seem to remain unresolved. Should we add mystery to the Mysteries? I do not think this is the right way to go toward the Truth.\n— — —\nBibliography:\nSumma de donis sancti Joseph. – “Titre” : En, lector ingenue, novum opus… Summa, in quatuor secta partes, de donis sancti Joseph, sponsi beatissimae Virginis Mariae ac patris putativi Christi Jesu… [aedita a fratre Isidoro de Isolanis.] – “Au fol. 101” : Papiaeque impressa, apud Jacob Paucidrapium, M.D.XXII., tertio cal. septembr___\nLink:\nhttps://books.google.it/books?id=ME7eXwAACAAJ&dq=inauthor:%22Isidoro+Isolano+(O.+P.,+Le+P.)%22&hl=it&sa=X&ei=2wsxVZPfLIORsAGOz4HIDA&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBg\n— —\nSorry.\nNow I think there is enough meat on the grill for all …\nand maybe there’s too much meat charred and\nso you have to look about your health (despite\nthe hopes arising by the use of AFM measurements\non cancer cells)!\n\n","date":"April 17, 2015 at 9:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/16/rogers-impurity-layer-and-di-lazzaros-experiments/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Rogers’ Impurity Layer and Di Lazzaro’s Experiments"},{"author":"piero","post":"In any case (if we want to promote the idea to search money to do new analyses)\nI think we can try to invent\n(at least) a curious promotional item:\nthe “Shroud-Watch”, where lancets that run over the Image\nare similar to two AFM tips …\nBut this thing is not so much curious and it seems a little bit vulgar.\n\n","date":"April 17, 2015 at 10:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/16/rogers-impurity-layer-and-di-lazzaros-experiments/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Rogers’ Impurity Layer and Di Lazzaro’s Experiments"},{"author":"piero","post":"Sorry…\nThe right word to write was “cantilevers” and not “tips”!\n— —\nIf we have some time at disposal we can also try to think to the possibility to build a MEMS device, a sort of “MEMS watch”, where a micro-nanomanipulator is used to deform a linen fibrils (a sort of “cantilever”) for flexural controls in AFM tests… in order to know what is the probable epoch of the ancient textile material.\n\n","date":"April 18, 2015 at 8:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/16/rogers-impurity-layer-and-di-lazzaros-experiments/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Rogers’ Impurity Layer and Di Lazzaro’s Experiments"},{"author":"piero","post":"If I am not mistaken, Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro had performed his calculations about the speed of the alleged phenomenon (and those calculations are rightly based on the speed of light in air and inside the linen fiber), namely: the glorious Resurrection Jesus from the dead!\nBut now I do not remember well (ie: exactly) what was the result he had obtained, however (if I’m not mistaken) Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro argued that the phenomenon Resurrection (seen in its concrete manifestation, in textile fibers) has had a speed that is connected to that of the Light … and up here we can also agree and try to deepen ourselves the problem (which is related to the formation of the surface layer on linen fibrils, the same layer that after aging turns into the “ghost”, a material that can fall … and of which I have spoken in an other message [linked to the strange “gopic hand test” = a vibrational test] that you can easily read).\nAlthough these speculations are a bit strange in the eyes of the profane (see,\nfor example, the harsh criticism of the “sins” made by “Shroudology” that is\npresent in the now famous book Nicolotti, published in Italy by Einaudi),\nI think that might be interesting.\nTo improve the calculations we should also keep in mind the speed of reaction\nto the light (of the excimer laser) of the material present at the surface\ncharacteristics of the fibrils.

The mineralogy of the Site 1256 carbonate veins is therefore determined from their Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios, which reveal two distinct groups (Fig. F1; Table T1). The compact calcite structure can incorporate the small Mg cation, whereas aragonite has a larger cation site and favors accommodation of the larger Sr cation (Deer et al., 1992). Samples with Sr/Ca ratios less than ~0.2 mmol/mol are classified as calcite, and those with Mg/Ca ratios of less than ~2.5 mmol/mol are classified as aragonite (Table T1; Fig. F1). The remaining samples, with intermediate compositions (Sr/Ca >0.2 mmol/mol and Mg/Ca >2.5 mmol/mol), are interpreted to be aragonite-calcite mixtures, which were homogenized during hand-picking. \n>Fe and Mn are similar in diameter to Mg and are therefore also preferentially incorporated into calcite, with Fe/Ca ranging from ~3 to ~35 mmol/mol and Mn/Ca ratios up to ~80 mmol/mol (Fig. F1). The aragonite veins have lower Fe/Ca ratios (The carbonate veins have 87Sr/86Sr ratios ranging from ~0.70804 to 0.70872. The majority of the aragonite veins have Sr isotopic compositions between ~0.7087 and ~0.7086, whereas the calcite veins precipitated from fluids with 87Sr/86Sr ranging from ~0.7086 to ~0.7080. The strontium isotopic composition of the oceans ~15 m.y. ago was ~0.70875 (Hodell et al., 1991), and it has increased progressively since then. All the carbonate veins precipitated from fluids with 87Sr/86Sr ratios lower than the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio has been since the eruption of the host basalt. The veins therefore all contain a discernible component of basalt-derived Sr (87Sr/86Sr ~0.7027).

A first isobar suppression is gained right in the ion source, if these do not form any negative ions (e.g. no formation of Mg- when analysing Al).\n>Selected ions with the correct energy, mass and charge are  injected into the 6 MV accelerator and accelerated to the positively charged high-voltage terminal. Negative ions are passing an area filled with argon gas, thus, loosing electrons from the outer shell. Thereby, all existing molecules are destroyed.

The Greek historian Polybius wrote of Roman funeral rites, so singular to the Hellenic eye, in which the death masks, carefully preserved for generations, would be paraded by descendants in the funeral procession. It was perilously close to ancestor worship and fraught with political meaning for in honoring a lineage of virtuous public service, the funeral procession served to remind Romans of an inheritance that made one fit to govern. It is significant that the masks preserved how a person really looked rather than how he wished to be seen.

Maroni et al. report 70−100 μg formaldehyde in the undiluted mainstream smoke of nonfilter cigarettes and 0.2 mg per cigarette in sidestream smoke.

All together, believers and not.\nSo… I do not rule entirely out the C14 (ie: control tests of a new type,\nrequiring very little material), but first I want to exactly see\nwhat we get from the non-destructive microscopic controls…\nIn any case the Carbon-14 dating should be repeated\nwith new instruments (and we can obtain more exact results)\nand done very carefully…\n— —\nHere what I have found today surfing the Web:\nQuestion:\n>How much radiation is emitted from a human being? \nAnswer:\n>All of us have a number of naturally occurring radionuclides within our bodies. The major one that produces penetrating gamma radiation that can escape from the body is a radioactive isotope of potassium, called potassium-40. This radionuclide has been around since the birth of the earth and is present as a tiny fraction of all the potassium in nature.\n>Potassium-40 (40K) is the primary source of radiation from the human body for two reasons. First, the 40K concentration in the body is fairly high. Potassium is ingested in many foods that we eat and is a critically important element for proper functioning of the human body; it is present in pretty much all the tissues of the body. The amount of the radioactive isotope 40K in a 70-kg person is about 5,000 Bq, which represents 5,000 atoms undergoing radioactive decay each second. \n>Second, 40K emits gamma rays in a little over 10 percent of its decays and most of these gamma rays escape the body. A gamma ray is emitted in about one out of every 10 disintegrations of 40K, implying that about 500 gamma rays are produced each second. These will be moving in all directions, some will be attenuated in the body, and the dose rate from these gamma rays outside of the individual’s body will represent a very small fraction of the normal background dose rate from all natural sources outside the body. \n>If a person is above average in weight, the dose rate outside of this person’s body will expectedly be higher than the dose outside the body of a lower-weight individual. In both cases, however, the dose rate will be extremely small compared to the normal background dose rate. The heavier person will receive a greater internal dose because the decay of the 40K produces other low-penetrating radiation (beta radiation) that deposits its energy within the body. However, the dose to the heavier individual will not be significantly different from that to the lower-weight individual because the energy deposited per unit body mass is the dose-determining factor, and this will be about the same for both individuals.\n>There are many other radionuclides in the human body, but these either are present at lower levels than 40K (for example, 238U, 232Th, and their decay products) or they do not emit gamma rays that can escape the body (for example, 14C and 87Rb). Radon (and its decay products) is not a significant source of radiation from humans because it is present at very low levels in the body. \n>There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. …\nLink:\nhttp://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/faqradbods.html\n— — —\nSo, our body (with the normal levels of radiation)\ncan not produce an Image like that of the Shroud\nThen …\nDo you think at “enhanced radioactive emissions” as\n“possible solution” of the problem?\nBut… where is the certified evidence for this particular hypothesis?\nIn any case we need the adequate analyses and\nI have (previously) indicated (in a rough manner… Sorry)\nwhat we can do.\nI repeat: I prefer to use the AFM techniques in order to properly\ninvestigate linen fibrils involved in B.I.F.

Perfumes, oils, and other fragrances played a key role in the process of mummifying a body for burial, as well as denoting what status the person held in life. Scientists have learned so much about the people of the past from studying mummified human remains, and much of the credit goes directly to the oils and perfumes that still reside within the bodies.\nScented oils were used as early as 10,000 BCE to help combat body odor and to soften the skin. Some of the most common scents used by the Egyptians were thyme, lavender, peppermint, cedar, rose, almond oil, and aloe. While providing a definitive use in life, these scents also had a purpose in death – namely, the process of Egyptian mummification. The famous method of embalming was developed around 2600 BCE (it does not appear that embalming was practiced by the Hebrews).\nThe Jews did not have that kind of embalming and there was a different kind of treatment for the deceased…\n— — —\nHere a title :\nMedicinal and Aromatic Plants of the Middle-EastSeries: Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World, Vol. 2 \nYaniv, Zohara, Dudai, Nativ (Eds.)\n2014, X, 337 p. 81 illus., 39 illus. in color\nPlants have been known and cultivated for their therapeutic properties in the Middle-East throughout recorded history and most likely – beyond that.

Also I think that a “disembodiment of God” is a strange theological concept and I do not think anyone has ever deepened. Anyway I’ll try to read up about another time …\n— — —\nNow I can not immediately put to argue that, in this step, can not be originated trace extremely significant (ie: the effects of nuclear radiation … and many other gadgets you want to bring up …), but my mind can understand very well that if there is a test observable (ascertainable by anyone with the will to investigate, of course …) of something that is not belonging to the ordinary “natural course of events”, then varies the normal condition of man’s freedom before the Mystery of God …\nIn short, free will it can be “crippled” in the sense that in front of “incontrovertible material evidence” of the Resurrection of Jesus (… And this, in a nutshell, what this means? The likely elimination of a Mystery of Faith! That is a fact not permitted by the normal Christian doctrine …) we would not be free (in our belief) but conditioned by a test material … and therefore the merit of our faith would be much diminished, or perhaps (even) voided (… and, among other things, about what I keep doubts) …\nSo that account (consequential) can be drawn?\nI take it you do not find what they say Antonacci and Linder (= evidence of nuclear radiation, isotopic significant changes, etc.) …and others (Siefker) …\n“Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?”  = 1 Corinthians 15:12 \nYou may get to deduct that existed the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ (from the testimony of the disciples, the Eucharistic miracles, etc., Etc.),  but give the proof of this on the basis of material effects even currently observable (= altered by nuclear radiation, etc.).\nI think both act contrary to common sense …\nThe Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ was and is only made in the hearts of the disciples, in the conversion … What Hope to save us we could have if we did not have more merits resulting from the Faith?\nIn conclusion:\nScience can not explain a mystery of faith.\nScience is the result of a human construction (and it is coming from the origins sometimes obscure or even mysterious connections = see f.e. the life of Newton […and what seems to us to be able to classify as his biblical and alchemical rantings. B.T.W. : Isaac Newton wrote fellow alchemist Robert Boyle a letter urging him to keep “high silence” in publicly discussing the principles of alchemy…]) during centuries … and sometimes fallible … really it is not infallible …\nIf science comes to really explain a mystery of Faith, then it seems to me possible to infer that the Mystery, in a certain sense, is no longer a mystery, it has become something demonstrated that one can not subtract, and, consequentially, the degree of freedom of man facing a Mystery revealed it is involved …\n— * — * —\nI’d be really curious (and at the same time, almost very intimidated …) if the predictions of Lindner (= radiocarbon dates move into the future!) come true (established after the appropriate controls) …\nIn fact: what sense could have that “radiocarbon date in the future,” seen as “proof of the Resurrection”?\nIn that case we would have still kept our freedom?\nNo doubt it would be a major stumbling block … and perhaps the only logical explanation that would be immediately indicated would be the objection that these radiocarbon results in the future would result from netron irradiation of the Cloth, presumably in modern times …\nStrange stories …\nPerhaps it is better to work in our field more restricted. So the strange matter about emanations of neutrons arising from piezonuclear reaction would not be even a story to be discarded altogether.

Due to the high linear energy transfer value, sensors designed to detect such radiation require placement in close proximity to the radiation source. Here we report the morphological changes and optical responses of artificially designed DNA thin films in response to exposure to alpha radiation as observed by an atomic force microscope, a Raman and a reflectance spectroscopes. In addition, we discuss the feasibility of a DNA thin film as a radiation sensing material. The effect of alpha radiation exposure on the DNA thin film was evaluated as a function of distance from an 241Am source and exposure time. Significant reflected intensity changes of the exposed DNA thin film suggest that a thin film made of biomolecules can be one of promising candidates for the development of online radiation sensors.\n— —\nThe unexpected nuclear accidents = See also: The Fukushima nuclear accident on March 2011, etc. …\nThe radiation effect on thin films was also studied using Raman\nspectroscopic analysis to determine the influence of exposure time\nand the distance of the film from the radiation source.\nThen, please, observe the comparative Raman spectra\nwithout and with radiation exposure…\nThe radiation source (in that work) 241Am, emits alpha particles.\nAnd alpha particles, consisting of helium nuclei, are emitted\nby various isotopes of actinides including Th, U, Np, Pu, Am and Cm. …\nSo it remains to see the composition of the stones of the walls\nwhere the Holy Shroud was guarded.\nFor example: I would start examining some site of Turin ….\nWhat do you think of this “obvious idea”?\nLink:\nhttp://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130624/srep02062/full/srep02062.html\n\n","date":"January 20, 2015 at 12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/19/jeffrey-skurka-on-buffalo-catholic-radio-station/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jeffrey Skurka on Buffalo Catholic Radio Station"},{"author":"piero","post":"Here I want to consider another time the following questionable statement\n(taken from the words by Siefker) :\n>The body image would lose its optical properties, a result of alignment being lost\nover time possibly just by moving the cloth through earth’s magnetic field\nsuch as when the cloth is being transported.\n(“The Enigma of the Apparent Age of the Shroud of Turin … etc. …”, slide 67 of 112)\nbecause, in my opinion, this is a too vague hypothesis …\nWhere is the true proof on linen fibrils ?\nWhere are inherent experiments or useful references ?\nYesterday I didn’t consider the questions:\nWhat were the exact conditions during the transport of the relic to/from Montevergine (Avellino)?\nWho was the responsible about the (possible) photographic controls?

Such forces are potentially damaging, particularly to thin or delicate samples. Recently, researchers have demonstrated a solution to this dilemma. The new method enables AFM measurements of elastic modulus with forces less than 20 nN, roughly 10 times the force needed to break a single atomic bond.\n— —\nJason P Killgore and Donna C Hurley 2012 Nanotechnology 23 055702 doi:10.1088/0957-4484/23/5/055702\nLow-force AFM nanomechanics with higher-eigenmode contact resonance spectroscopy \nlink :\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/0957-4484/23/5/055702/\n>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods for quantitative measurements of elastic modulus on stiff (>10 GPa) materials typically require tip–sample contact forces in the range from hundreds of nanonewtons to a few micronewtons. Such large forces can cause sample damage and preclude direct measurement of ultrathin films or nanofeatures. Here, we present a contact resonance spectroscopy AFM technique that utilizes a cantilever’s higher flexural eigenmodes to enable modulus measurements with contact forces as low as 10 nN, even on stiff materials. Analysis with a simple analytical beam model of spectra for a compliant cantilever’s fourth and fifth flexural eigenmodes in contact yielded good agreement with bulk measurements of modulus on glass samples in the 50–75 GPa range. In contrast, corresponding analysis of the conventionally used first and second eigenmode spectra gave poor agreement under the experimental conditions. We used finite element analysis to understand the dynamic contact response of a cantilever with a physically realistic geometry. Compared to lower eigenmodes, the results from higher modes are less affected by model parameters such as lateral stiffness that are either unknown or not considered in the analytical model. Overall, the technique enables local mechanical characterization of materials previously inaccessible to AFM-based nanomechanics methods.\n—————————————————-\nThere are two systems :\nflexural tests and indentation tests…\nFor this second system, see the nanoindentation :\n>Nanoindentation is a variety of indentation hardness tests applied to small volumes. Indentation is perhaps the most commonly applied means of testing the mechanical properties of materials. The nanoindentation technique was developed in the mid-1970s to measure the hardness of small volumes of material…\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoindentation\n— —\nHere a vague reference (not in the field of textiles) :\nCalculation of Young’s modulus value by means of AFM.\nRoa JJ, Oncins G, Diaz J, Sanz F, Segarra M.\nRecent Pat Nanotechnol. 2011 Jan;5(1):27-36.\nAbstract\n>In the last years, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has become a powerful tool not only to study the surface morphology but also the nanomechanics of all kind of samples.

The patents concerning picoindentation measurements are discussed in the text and special attention is paid to measurements performed on hard materials as ceramics, as they have not been as thoroughly reviewed in the literature as in the case of soft matter.

Sorry!):\n>September 1939: six days after the German invasion of Poland, the sacred cloth according to the Christians has wrapped the body of Christ in the Sepulchre left Turin for the first time in almost four centuries. Destination, dark abbey avellinese: Montevergine. Officially, it was necessary to protect the only relic from the bombing, but the real fear was that he could throw another cross over its shadow: the Nazi swastika …\n>Among the documents consulted showed a singular fact: Cardinal Fossati, Archbishop of Turin, had not even been informed of the start of the Holy Shroud in Turin on 7 September 1939. One possible reason may have been the need for the Cardinal, not knowing this, he could not talk even under torture. He would go to Montevergine, after the war, to bring the Holy Shroud in Turin after obtaining the consent of King Umberto II, now in exile for a few months: a consensus being essential property of the House of Savoy, the Shroud. In a letter dated June 10, 1946, just three days before departure for exile, Umberto II wrote to Cardinal Fossati: “The current events lead me today to tell Your Eminence that – while it is my understanding that the precious relic remains sacred and inalienable heritage of my house – do right now my full consent to that returns to its pristine placement in Turin, in the chapel which bears the name. ”\n>In an exchange of ideas with the researcher and historian Lucan, Dr. Paul Tritto, revealed an interesting argument about a book by Giorgio Galli entitled “Hitler and magical Nazism.”\n[Here my note = …B.T.W.: I have bought that book several years ago…]\n>Tritto writes: “In the book of Galli you will find something on the relationship between the Nazis and the esoteric. Upon reading I thought credible reconstructions of Galli. Even today, I think largely valid, but Galli ends, perhaps unwittingly, to draw a picture which comes from outside the usual Hitler schizophrenic. Instead, I believe that Hitler had a vision too shiny to be conceived by the mind of a deranged. Sure, it was totally out of the normal. But I would not speak of schizophrenia; perhaps his was a diabolical design or even the result of a personality “possessed”. Perhaps it is a case of demonic possession. I do not think, therefore, that Hitler wanted to take possession of the Shroud for esoteric rites. In my opinion the Shroud had to represent for him the symbol of something, then had a meaning more realistic. I also cite another book “Conversations with Hitler” Hermann Rauschning. In a chapter called “the Antichrist” the author refers to private conversations in which Hitler had explicitly expressed the intention “of radically eradicate Christianity in Germany with all its roots and its branches.” But it is not a simple hostility to support this diabolical plan, there is rather the intention of usurping the place of the Catholic Church in its mission to redeem humanity. Rauschning reports that Hitler once said: “I want to reveal a secret. Foundations with an Order. “The goal, says Rauschning, was to transform the SS into a kind of caste of priests secrets. The same author also reports that one day a woman in his entourage gave Hitler a strange suggestion that seems to have influenced him; she advised him to follow the path of “white magic” and be wary instead from “black magic”. The most powerful talisman of white magic is considered quite the Holy Shroud. Perhaps it was this – concludes Paul Tritto – the path that led Hitler to design of possession. ”\n— — —\nBut luckily in Germany not everyone thought like Hitler!\nUnfortunately\n>On 19 January 1944 Moltke was arrested and the Kreisau Circle fell into disarray. The focus of some circle members had been turning towards an active political coup, and some participated in the failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler by Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg on July 20, 1944. After the failure of this plot, many members of the Circle were arrested and were executed.\nLibnk:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreisau_Circle\nSo I wonder how a highly efficient information network could not know\nanything about the fate of the Shroud. … Do they thought that this relic\nwas transferred to Monte Cassino?\nIn each case the systems of intelligence (= Monarchy and Vatican) had been effective in hiding the information to the German Nazis …\nMaybe you can make a comparison with a “parallel case”,\nnamely that of “The Library of the Jewish Community of Rome” …\nToday there is an article in an italian newspaper (“Corriere della Sera”)\nabout that “Library of the Jewish Community of Rome”,\nthis article is titled:\n“Roman Jews (and the police) chasing the stolen library.”\n>In 1943 the Nazi raid to document the “lost civilization”.\n>Lost track of 7000 volumes.

It was previously thought that the surface tension of tears was due to dissolved mucin, but it has recently been shown that very little mucin is present. The surface tensions of solutions of commercial mucin, lysozyme, lactoferrin or secretory IgA are all higher than that of tears. The influence of tear lipocalin and lipids remained to be tested. Methods. Surface tension was determined by a micro-method on pooled. intact stimulated human tears, and following extraction with lipid solvents. The extracted material was also added back, as was a variety of lipid standards (phospholipids, glycolipids, sterols, etc.). TLC and GLC were used in partial identification of the extract. Another lipocalin, bovine ß-lactoglobulin, was also tested alone and mixed with tear lipids, model lipids, or model tear proteins. Results. Intact tears had a surface tension of 42-46 mN/m, but after lipid extraction this rose to 53-55.5 mN/m. Addition of lipids to the delipidised tear fluid gave a range of tensions from 42 to 49 mN/m, with the greatest effects shown by phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin), but full recovery was only achieved by using the extracted lipid material. … … etc. … …\nLink: http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1076/ceyr.19.1.4.5341\n— —\nSo…\nI hope to read no irreverent comments on these easy\nsuggestions of “AFM research on linens sprayed on by tears”.\nI personally, I have doubts about the level of absorption of tears\nby the linen (it’s a question of the surface tension for both:\nlinen and  tears)…\nWhat is your opinion ?\n\n","date":"May 4, 2015 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/03/three-millions-page-views/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Three Millions Page Views"},{"author":"piero","post":"Here another very “very particular” question connected to the tears\nand to the Purkinje images, that are reflections of objects\nfrom the structure of the eye…\n>…They are also known as Purkinje reflexes and\nas Purkinje-Sanson images…\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_images\nHere the question:\nWhat is the effect of tears on Purkinje images?\nI refer to the presumed “Purkinje images” present\non the famous tilma of Guadalupe…\nLink:","date":"May 4, 2015 at 8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/03/three-millions-page-views/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Three Millions Page Views"},{"author":"piero","post":"I beg your pardon for eventual translation error that occurred,\nin any case the old italian article wrote:\n>With SEM, the scanning electron microscope which identified the image by mapping the chemical paper fibers were examined points of slobber/blur/smudge: “We realized that there are salts of potassium and chlorine of their tears, but at the same time that the paper was processed with chlorine” did say the biologist.\n>For more information, you should, however, take the material and analyze the DNA, but this goes against the principles of restoration: “For ethical choice, we can not do destructive analysis.

PLSR and PCR are both methods to model a response variable when there are a large number of predictor variables, and those predictors are highly correlated or even collinear. Both methods construct new predictor variables, known as components, as linear combinations of the original predictor variables, but they construct those components in different ways. PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all. On the other hand, PLSR does take the response variable into account, and therefore often leads to models that are able to fit the response variable with fewer components. Whether or not that ultimately translates into a more parsimonious model, in terms of its practical use, depends on the context.\n— —-\n>… These data are described in Kalivas, John H., “Two Data Sets of Near Infrared Spectra,” Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, v.37 (1997) pp.255-259.\nLink:\nhttp://it.mathworks.com/help/stats/examples/partial-least-squares-regression-and-principal-components-regression.html\n—- —\nThe Collinearity Problem in Linear Regression.

By varying the upper bound of correlation coefficient between absorbance and analyte’s content, the CCO-PLS method achieved multi-band selection. Two PLS-based methods, which used a waveband having positive peaks of the first loading vector (FLV) and a combination of positive peaks of the correlation coefficient spectrum, were also conducted for comparison. Based on the leave-one-out cross-validation for CCO-PLS, appropriate waveband combinations for ALB and GLB were selected, the root-mean-square errors of prediction for validation samples were 1.36 and 1.35 (g L−1) for ALB and GLB, respectively, which were better than the two comparison methods. The CCO-PLS method provided a new approach for multi-band selection to achieve high analytical accuracy for molecular absorption bands that were composed of several spaced wavebands.\n— — —\nDear “daveb of wellington nz”,\nperhaps our friend Colin knows the article:\n“PLS regression methods”\nby\nAgnar Höskuldsson.\nIt’s an article first published online: 30 Mar 2005.\nOriginal article in “Journal of Chemometrics”,\nVolume 2, Issue 3, pages 211–228, June 1988\nAbstract\n>In this paper we develop the mathematical and statistical structure of PLS regression.

Any such hesitations, however, form no part of the Pope’s thinking.\n>Laudato Si’ appears closely to reflect the influence of the environmentalist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a pillar of the UN’s tendentiously political Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), who has been described in the New York Times as “a scientist known for his aggressive stance on climate policy” and who the Pope recently appointed to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, despite his other beliefs (he is hardly a Catholic thinker).\n>As the Vatican correspondent Edward Pentin comments: “Critics have warned that by falling in with proponents of climate change science, the Pope risks getting too close to other key supporters of the theory who support population control and abortion.”\n>Schellnhuber, perhaps not surprisingly given his current prominence as a papal adviser, claims not to be in favour of population control, but that is of course ridiculous, and even in the recent interview with Pentin in which he is taken to be repudiating the idea of limiting the world’s population, he can’t hide his real underlying assumptions. \n>Here he is: “If you want to reduce human population, there are wonderful means: Improve the education of girls and young women. Then the demographic transition will be a little bit faster… So I subscribe to a good education, and that’s the only way of population strategy I would support.”\nIn other words, teach the girls about artificial birth control. “If you want to reduce human population”, he says. Well, there’s no if about it: the fact is that he clearly does want to reduce the human population. That’s population control. It is nonsense for him to deny he’s not in favour of it. Does he think we are all fools? \n>Parts of the encyclical are crude in the extreme. “A number of scientific studies indicate,” says Pope Francis, though without specifying which, “that most [that’s right, he says ‘most’] global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly [I repeat “mainly”] as a result of human activity.”\nActually, only about five per cent of present atmospheric carbon dioxide is derived from the use of fossil fuels; that is, just 19 parts of CO2 per million parts of atmosphere. Most CO2 is a natural part of the atmosphere. It is not pollution: indeed, human life is largely dependent on it since without CO2 there could be no growth of any kind of vegetable matter: no CO2, no trees. No trees, no oxygen. And yet Francis writes that “Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain”: It’s a dubious theory put forward by some: but it is far from having been proved.\n>The danger of getting too closely involved in the politics of climate change is that they destructively divert our attention, (and that “our” includes the Pope himself), from a political imperative one would have thought much closer to the heart of what Francis, and with him the Church, really cares about.

In particular, parameters such as the high photon flux, the small source size and the low divergence attained at the synchrotron make it a very efficient source for a range of advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques, adapted to the heterogeneity and great complexity of the materials under study. The continuous tunability of the source — its very extended energy distribution over wide energy domains (meV to keV) with a high intensity — is an essential parameter for techniques based on a very fine tuning of the probing energy to reach high chemical sensitivity such as XANES, EXAFS, STXM, UV/VIS spectrometry, etc. The small source size attained (a few micrometres) at least in the vertical plane leads to spatial coherence of the photon beams, giving rise in turn to a series of imaging methods already crucial to the field. This review of the existing literature shows that microfocused hard X-ray spectroscopy (absorption, fluorescence, diffraction), full-field X-ray tomography and infrared spectroscopy are the leading synchrotron techniques in the field, and presents illustrative examples of the study of ancient and historical materials for the various methods. Fast developing analytical modalities in scanning spectroscopy (STXM, macro-XRF scanning) and novel analytical strategies regarding optics, detectors and other instrumental developments are expected to provide major contributions in the years to come. Other energy domains are increasingly being used or considered such as far-infrared and ultraviolet/visible for spectroscopy and imaging. We discuss the main instrumental developments and perspectives, and their impact for the science being made on ancient materials using synchrotron techniques.\n\n","date":"February 20, 2014 at 10:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"author":"piero","post":"Thank you for your answers !\nIn the past I have read something on odd-ratio and bookmaker rule …\nSorry…\nAs you have seen I get lost writing something (… of superabundant ?) on laminographic controls (this kind of analyses can be useful in parchement study.

From 1921 to 1945 he was the director of the Norman Bridges Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena; he was also the chairman of the executive committee of the Cal Tech.

Did blood actually come from the Lord’s skin, or is the language merely a figure of speech emphasizing the Savior’s agony? The only New Testament writer to mention this phenomenon is Luke, a physician (Col. 4:14).\nHere I should write a few lines on the ancient medical knowledge and the visual examination of the Shroud …\nI believe that the Shroud has nothing to do with Madame Blavatsky, but … See also the possible (or impossible) connections:\nShroud-Antioch-theory by Markwardt-St Luke and the Shroud…\nThe idea of Messiah can also be found in Buddhism, where the bodhisattva Maitreya plays a similar function as a Messiah… It is said that Maitreya’s coming will occur after the teachings of the current Buddha Gautama, the Dharma, are no longer taught and are completely forgotten…\nNow I apologize for the possible (great) confusion (!) occurred with the use of a series of mental associations (perhaps not always entirely consistent) … \nBut yesterday I have spent some time rereading a book by prof. P.L. Baima Bollone:\n“L’ identità di Gesù. La vera storia di Gesù Bambino” (= The identity of Jesus. The true story of the Child Jesus.).\nThis book breaks away from misconceptions  (and in that book there are also reported interesting theosophical and anthroposophic  tracks) and try to trace the identity of Jesus and the events of his birth on the basis of biological and natural that can be seen in the sources. \nTheosophy teaches the unity of man and the equality of all races, creeds, color and sex. Blavatsky believed in the world religions, and the coming of the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, the Ajita Bodhisattva, “that would return to teach the pure Dharma, at a time of darkness on the earth, when the Dharma will have been forgotten.” ( Wikipedia)\nSo…  Blavatsky believed the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, is linked to the Return of Jesus and the other ascendant masters. Blavatsky talked of a so-called Christ Principle, which in her view corresponds to the spiritual essence of every human being.\nMaitreya is a bodhisattva who in the Buddhist tradition is to appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor of the historic Śākyamuni Buddha. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya references a time when the Dharma will seem to be forgotten on Jambudvipa. … \nIn his eulogy to Isaac Newton written in 1927, the bicentenary of the great man’s death, Einstein called him a “shining spirit”.

ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ, variant form Abrasax, ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ) was a word of mystic meaning in the system of the Gnostic Basilides, being there applied to the “Great Archon” (Gk., megas archōn), the princeps of the 365 spheres (Gk., ouranoi).[1] The seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the seven classic planets—Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn …\n>The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung wrote a short Gnostic treatise in 1916 called The Seven Sermons to the Dead, which called Abraxas a god higher than the Christian God and devil that combines all opposites into one being. (= “There is a God about whom you know nothing, because men have forgotten him. We call him by his name: Abraxas. He is less definite than God or Devil…”)\n>The magic word “Ablanathanalba,” which reads in Greek the same backward as forward, also occurs in the Abrasax-stones as well as in the magic papyri. This word is usually conceded to be derived from the Hebrew (Aramaic), meaning “Thou art our father” (אב לן את), and also occurs in connection with Abrasax…\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraxas\n— — —\nIn short, what I mean is that believers in God can not stay too anchored to a given cosmology … that maybe it can also be false.\nIn this Scientific American interview with physicist George F.R. Ellis, he discusses Lawrence Krauss’ belief that physics has explained “why there is something rather than nothing.” Krauss’ metaphysical claim is, of course, much loved by New Atheists who believe that science has explained pretty much everything.

Three proteins have been purified by immunohistological methods and located to specific regions of the byssus. A collagenous protein with subunit molecular weights of 53,000, 55,000 and 65,000 is found in the matrix of the elastic thread region. Its 73,000-MW precursor was extracted from foot glands in the area proximal to the animal body and was identified by immune cross-reactivity. A cystine-rich, acidic protein was found in all regions of the byssus associated with a third protein, the polyphenolic protein. The L-dopa-containing polyphenolic protein appears in the cortex of the entire thread and adhesive plaque and at the substrate-plaque interface. Antiserum to this protein stains spherical vesicles in the phenol gland of the foot. Using immuno-electrophoretic methods, the polyphenolic protein and the cystine-rich protein were shown to form high molecular weight aggregates with aging of the byssus.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2014 at 6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/02/manoppello-shroud-and-durer-a-short-presentation-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Manoppello, Shroud and Durer:  A Short Presentation by O.K."},{"author":"piero","post":"Continuation of the notes:\n>Le linceul arrive à Montfort par la famille de Vergy propriétaire du château de Montfort au XVe siècle.\n>Cette famille serait entrée en possession de cette relique grâce à Othon de la Roche, croisé bourguignon de la quatrième croisade, qui l’aurait pris pendant le sac de Constantinople en 1204.

It was found that the microwaves of centimetre-wavelengths and their harmonics can produce an accelerated rotation of the water dipole-molecules, and this effect can have as a result the dehydration process – the ‘driving out’ of water dipole-molecules from the smallest cavities and projecting them in the open air. This is exactly the process of electromagnetic dehydration.”4 Similarly, dehydrated cellulose of the Shroud fibrils is the cause of the image according to STURP, not paint, pigments, or other substances5.\n>Although not fully understood or accepted by mainstream science, some physicists do believe that the pyramid is, not only an accumulator of energies, but also a modifier of these same energies. It is recognized that any object in which energy vibrates is capable of acting as a resonating cavity. It is further speculated that this energy would affect the molecules, or crystals, of any object in the path of the beam of focused energy.

The genome was extracted from the toe bone of a Neanderthal from over 50,000 years ago, found in a Siberian cave.\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_genome_project\n— — —\nHere another link (2010) about Svante Paabo:\nhttp://www.eva.mpg.de/neandertal/press/presskit-neandertal/pdf/PR_MPI_Neandertal_EN.pdf\n\n","date":"February 24, 2015 at 9:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/bruno-barberis-interview-the-only-serious-and-honest-behavior/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Bruno Barberis Interview: ‘The only serious and honest behavior’"},{"author":"piero","post":"In 1998 I wanted to draw attention to the new advanced microscopy techniques (see also their use in explorations performed by space probes …).\nI have found the following title:\n“Structure by Feel”\n> … …Applying the sensitive touch of atomic force microscopy to DNA, cells, and proteins…\n>One major benefit of AFM is that destructive agents like fluorescent proteins need not be applied.

Here is the simple explanation for the annoying repetition of similar messages.\nMaybe there were line problems or other causes.\nI hope that this never happens again.\n— — —\nHere what I have found surfing the Web today:\n>1. – Where were the Jerusalem samples taken?\nDr. Nitowsky (Sr. Damian of the Cross) sampled in Israel, nine sites which included:\n1. Emmaus; 2. Jericho, at Herod’s palace; 3. Qumran ; 4. Beth Shan ; 5 Sepphoris; 6 and 7 Beth She’arim; 8 Jerusalem; 9. Mt Carmel”. The Jerusalem samples are further identified as in the École Biblique tomb complex and more particularly from the bench of the tomb.”\n>2. … … omitted … …\n>3. – How was the Aragonite identified from Jerusalem?\n>Kohlbeck analysed with the microscope thin sections of the Jerusalem tomb and he concluded was Aragonite. The strongest way to distinguish Aragonite from Calcite is the X-ray diffraction to determine the crystalline structure. However, this test was never mentioned. But Kohlbeck should be able to recognize through the microscope the aragonite versus the common calcite. Nevertheless, this is not the key question because actually, Aragonite is very spread and very common. It should be easy to find Aragonite in the Jerusalem rock and in the Shroud too and its presence in the Shroud cannot be taken as a clue of its stay in Jerusalem. Only specific traces (iron and strontium) could give an indicative fingerprint. Kohlbeck applied the X-Ray fluorescence method to detect traces of iron and strontium and being not able to find lead.\nIt is the further analysis conducted by Dr. Riccardo Levi-Setti through his high-resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy that provided the true “little DNA” or “finger print” to be compared with the samples of the Shroud (fibers).\nlink:\nhttp://www.holyshroudguild.org/cesar2.html\n— — —\nSIMS\n link:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_ion_mass_spectrometry\n— — —\n>Ion microprobes, also known as secondary ion mass spectrometers (SIMS), use a finely focused ion beam to probe a selected sample domain.  A small percentage of the material sputtered from the polished surface of the sample is ionized, and these ions are accelerated into a mass spectrometer where they are separated according to their mass-over-charge ratio.  An important characteristic of SIMS is its high sensitivity compared to other microbeam sampling techniques: the ability to count individual ions results in detection limits in the parts-per-billion range for many elements.  Also the fact that ions derived from the sample are separated by their mass-over-charge ratio allows isotopic analyses to be performed on test portion masses that can be as small as 200 picograms. \nLink:\nhttp://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/research/organizational-units/departments/department-4/inorganic-and-isotope-geochemistry/infrastructure/secondary-ion-mass-spectrometry-sims/\nDo you know the dimensions and volumes of the craters produced\nduring secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis ?\n— — —\nSuper-SIMS (SIMS = Secondary ion mass spectrometry) – also called Accelerator-SIMS or Trace Element AMS (TREAMS)  – is an ultrasensitive analytical method for the determination of stable elements and isotopes.\nDue to the acceleration of the extracted sample ions to MeV-energies and their charge reversal from negative to positive ions, Super-SIMS can reach about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower detection limits  (up to 10-12 or ppt, highly depending on analyte and matrix) as conventional SIMS. …\nLink:\nhttp://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=2809\n\n","date":"September 30, 2014 at 8:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/28/searching-stephen-jones-quotation-archives/","cat":"quotations","title":"Searching Stephen Jones’ Quotation Archives"},{"author":"piero","post":"I think we, before investigating on many (interesting)\nmiracles … and other phenomena .. we should improve\nknowledges that can be useful for our research\nabout the Shroud.\nFor example, here a case…\nI have read that:\n>MALDI-IMS involves the visualization of\nthe spatial distribution of proteins, peptides, lipids,\nand other small molecules within thin slices of tissue,\nsuch as animal or plant.\nSo… the question to pose is the following:\nIs it possible to work on linen fibrils with MALDI-IMS\n(Link:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALDI_imaging )\nin order to detect (in an exact manner) the molecules\nand the degree of polymerization of cellulose and lignin?\nIn my idea the answer is: not.\nWhat is your opinion?\nHow to deepen the analyses on that “textile mystery”?\n\n","date":"September 10, 2015 at 12:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/07/a-massive-effort-called-sturp/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"A Massive Effort Called STURP"},{"author":"piero","post":"So …\nWe have to check what was the right age about three different epochs :\n1a- 16th century (Duchess Margaret of Austria)\n1b- 1694 Sebastian Valfré\n2- 1864/68 Princess Clothild\nIs it possible to believe in a simple solution for that (little) enigma ?\nThe answer (IMO) is :\nYes for 1 and 2, because (using the adequate advanced tools\n[= with nanomechanical or/and nanochemistry controls]) we can try to test\nthese samples.\nInstead there is too little difference about 1a and 1b…\n— —\nIn any case I am curious about the results\nfrom the control on that “probable”  (= are most likely).\n“micro-reconstructions by princess Clothilde of\nSavoy-Bonaparte in 1863/8” …\n— —\nB.T.W. :\nWho was the “Master of upholstery in Royal court” ?\n(Reference : the same message by Max P.Hamon, dated\nAug 8, 20014 at 10:29)\n\n","date":"August 9, 2014 at 9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"}],"resources":[{"author":"piero","post":"I have read the five pages by Rainer Riesner,\nbut without the help of notes (the footnotes), this text appears a bit lacking and all the problem inherent to the family of Jesus seems to be inconclusive …\n— —\nUnfortunately I have not read the book by Riesner :\nJesus, Qumran and the Vatican Paperback – International Edition, May 1, 2012\nand so I could not properly appreciate the possible connection between “Christianity in Eastern Syria and Jewish-Christians in Palestine, influenced by Essenism” (…are these ideas only mere claims?…).\n… Also … I remember that Antonio Lombatti was strictly contrary to the authenticity of the “Legend of Abgar”.\n— — —\nOn the other hand you can try to find something of useful in the paper titled:\n“Judas, Thaddeus, Addai: possible connections with the vicissitudes of the Edessean and Constantinopolitan Mandylion and any research perspectives”\nby\nAndrea Di Genua, Emanuela Marinelli, Ivan Polverari and Domenico Repice\n(Bari, 4-5 September, 2015)\nLink:\nhttp://www.sindone.info/BARI2.PDF\nBut I think you should also read the paper by Scavone…\nLink:\nhttp://www.shroud.it/SCAVONE1.PDF\n— — — —\nAt this point, see also the recent paper by A.

Slowly the content of the letter written by Jesus, together with its apotropaic function for the city, were transferred, as from the fifth century, onto an image that is not part of the earliest versions of the story.\n>In the sixth century, the image itself, which was originally a colored picture of the face of Jesus, was transformed, especially in the Byzantine environment, into a miraculous imprint of Jesus’ face left on a cloth, but not everyone was aware of this evolution.\n[Then, here my short note: See also the Holy Face of Manoppello!…]\n>Several exemplars of the image – per- haps slightly individualized in the features shown – began to compete with one another for preeminence, and countless reproductions of each were pro- duced, all sharing some key elements: the presence of the towel that showed only the face of a living Jesus.\n>The legends that relate the transformation of the painting into an acheiropoieton are comparable, although they differ in some details.

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are one group of nanoparticles that have high potential economic value but present substantial challenges to the development of the measurement science. Even the largest trees owe their strength to this newly appreciated class of nanomaterials. Cellulose is the world’s most abundant natural, renewable, biodegradable polymer. Cellulose occurs as whisker-like microfibrils that are biosynthesized and deposited in plant material in a continuous fashion. The nanocrystals are isolated by hydrolyzing away the amorphous segments leaving the acid resistant crystalline fragments. Therefore, the basic raw material for new nanomaterial products already abounds in nature and is available to be utilized in an array of future materials. However, commercialization requires the development of efficient manufacturing processes and nanometrology to monitor quality. This paper discusses some of the instrumentation, metrology and standards issues associated with the ramping up for production and use of CNCs.\nLink:\nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/0957-0233/22/2/024005\n— — — — — — — — — —\nHere other references… \n– about the Transverse Modulus:\nTransverse Elasticity of Cellulose\nNanocrystals Via Atomic Force Microscopy\nby\nRyan Wagner, Arvind Raman, and Robert Moon\n– bout cell walls:\nMicromechanics of Cell Walls\nby\nIngo Burgert and John W.C.

Gibson\nDOI: 10.1098/rsif.2012.0341Published 7 November 2012\nAbstract\nThe cell walls in plants are made up of just four basic building blocks: cellulose (the main structural fibre of the plant kingdom) hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. Although the microstructure of plant cell walls varies in different types of plants, broadly speaking, cellulose fibres reinforce a matrix of hemicellulose and either pectin or lignin. The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb-like cells of wood to the closed-cell, liquid-filled foam-like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young’s modulus varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to 30 GPa in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0.3 MPa in parenchyma to over 300 MPa in dense palm. The moduli and compressive strength of plant materials span this entire range. This study reviews the composition and microstructure of the cell wall as well as the cellular structure in three plant materials (wood, parenchyma and arborescent palm stems) to explain the wide range in mechanical properties in plants as well as their remarkable mechanical efficiency.\nLink:\nhttp://royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/76/2749\n… and there would still be many more studies to read!!!\n\n","date":"October 24, 2014 at 10:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/430-wikipedia-articles-mention-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","title":"430 Wikipedia Articles Mention the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"piero","post":"Analyses on linen fibrils treated with iron oxides,\nmake use of instrumental color matching is an important step …\n>Colour analysis of blends containing iron oxide can be conducted through use of a\ncolorimeter, which measures that reflectance pattern of electromagnetic radiation emanating\nfrom the powder sample using a particular light source …\n>The colour values of iron oxide pigment have been observed to be sensitive to relative\nhumidity (during mixing) and post-mixing storage conditions (relative humidity, temperature)\nand time. …\nSource:\nAnalysis of dry Powder Mixing Processes  using a FINE COHESIVE PIGMENT\nDavid Barling, Assoc.

Because of this, scientists believe that one of the major functions of pollenkitt is to help the pollen stick to the bugs.\n>Honey bees have special body parts where they pack pollen to be carried back to the hive. The parts—one on each hind leg—are called corbiculae or “pollen baskets.” The corbiculae are covered with hairs which help to hold the pollen in place, but very sticky pollen can form large clumps—something that makes provisioning even easier.\n>The pollen from many wind pollinated plants, such as grass, is much drier and not nearly so sticky. This pollen has to be carried in smaller clumps and so the bees have to make more trips to collect an equal amount, which wastes both time and energy. … …\n>Plants that are insect pollinated not only have sticky pollen, they have lots of pollen. This provides the win-win relationship that defines plant-pollinator mutualisms. … ..\n>Researchers have suggested many other reasons for pollenkitt and, in truth, it probably has multiple functions. It may keep the pollen from blowing away or drying out, or it may protect the pollen from ultra-violet radiation and certain pathogens.\n— —\nI hope in your comments …\n\n","date":"August 1, 2014 at 12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/28/a-new-paper-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A New Paper by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"piero","post":"The religious idea of resurrection was already known in ancient Egypt.\nOsiris was the Resurrected Savior-God of life and of death.\n>…Osiris was the hope of everyman.

Giuseppe Ghiberti and his life in Turin, but the haughty approach\nby Louis about the biblical studies by Ghiberti and the attempt to dialogue\nwith another religion during a meeting is a bit strange …or worrying….\nHere I want to add few lines:\nalthough I understand the critical situation (and the urgent need to dialogue to prevent extremist acts from both followers),\nit’s hard to believe that Muslims [apart the strange heretic sect Ahmadhija, well known for particular ideas and\nstrange interests about Jesus, the Rozabal, etc.] and Christians find common ground on the Shroud.\nHere another question (apparently far from the subject treated here):\nLudvik Leibler is a French physicist who has developed a revolutionary new technique\nabout the use of a nanoparticle solution made from polymers to connect human tissue.\nHe has been awarded with Descartes-Huygens Prize (a prize set up by the French and Dutch\ngovernments in 1995). In the past he won an ACS Award in Polymer Chemistry for his pioneering work\non the self-assembly of polymer systems.\nIf we wiil be able to show the true epoch of the Ancient Linen (without to destroy the Holy Shroud!),\nbut I don’t believe we will be in the list for these future Awards if we are not able to do something instead to\ndiscuss about the Koran.\nThis question seems to be very important and all the scientists\n(independently from their religious ideas. See also the example of Pontifical Academia…)\ncan collaborate in order to discover the truth. So, the words by Msgr. Ghiberti should be an interesting point  to start toward this direction.\nBut, knowing something about the ideas of Pallavicini (who seemed to be rigorous about Tradition, etc.),\nI have some doubt… because I believe thee approach by Co.re.is (Islamic religious community) to the Christian world\nand Tradition is a knotty problem.\nI like the idea nevertheless, then I hope in that possible inter-religious (and also scientific, if possible…) dialogue…\nThere is a German book that can be indicated as an exemple of  what some layman can read about the Shroud:\nDas Jesu Komplott, by Holger Kersten and Elmar Gruber\n( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Kersten ) and then a particular Islamic Tradition  (connected with these ideas) can be understood [= the first book by Holger Kersten: “Jesus Lived in India” promotes the claims both of Nicolas Notovich (1894) regarding the unknown years of Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30 in India, also Ahmadiyya founder Ghulam Ahmad’s claims regarding the years aged 33 to age 120 in India, and the burial of Jesus at the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar]. But I don’t believe that Pallavicini is in this field of Islamic Tradition, then a more refined Knowledge (avoiding blasphemies!) is required\nto discuss a Mystery of Faith, this is an useful way for both religious fields.\nPerhaps there are several studies connected :\n– Gnostics\n– Liber Schale Machometi (= “Halmahereig”, translated by Abraham Alfaquim)\n– question of “Ascended Masters”\nand inherent Traditions,\nstarting from \n– the ancient Pharaohs,\nFor example:\n>Amenhotep III is believed to have begun his rule at about the age of nine. It is likely that a relative acted as regent for him until he came of age. As an Egyptian Pharaoh, Amenhotep III, and his wife Tiye are known as the founders of monotheism in Egypt, a practice continued and expanded by one of Amenhotep’s sons, Akhenaten, an incarnation of an ascended master … (Warning!!!

Partly based on their scholarship, Guénon in 1925 published The Esoterism of Dante. From the theses of Rosetti and Aroux, Guénon retains only those elements that prove the existence of such hidden meanings; but he also makes clear that esoterism is not ‘heresy’ and that a doctrine reserved for an elite can be superimposed on the teaching given the faithful without standing in opposition to it. …\n— —- —\nHowever I think it is a little disconcerting that, in the city of the shroud and the famous Eucharistic Miracle (1453), we have to be reduced to humiliate our pride\ngoing to the house of the Muslims …\n>The event which led to the construction of the church occurred on 6 June 1453 during the war between Louis of Savoy and France.

A foil of CR-39 etched electrochemically results in a simple and sensitive neutron dosimeter with a response proportional to the dose over the entire energy range of interest.\n — —\nHere the explanation about CR-39, or allyl diglycol carbonate (ADC):\n>It is a plastic polymer commonly used in the manufacture of eyeglass lenses…\n>… An alternative use includes a purified version that is used to measure neutron radiation, a type of ionizing radiation, in neutron dosimetry. …\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR-39\n— — —\nCarpinteri claimed the fission for Iron atoms,\nbut I have never seen the use of SSNTD in the inherent experiments.\nCarpinteri believed in normal EDS (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy)\ncontrols…\nSee also:\nEnergy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis on rock samples\nsubjected to piezonuclear tests.\nby A.

For each sample, different measurements of the same crystalline phases (phengite and biotite) were performed in order to get averaged information of the chemical composition and to detect possible piezonuclear transmutations from iron to lighter elements. The results of EDS analyses show that, in the fracture surface samples, a considerable reduction in the iron content (~25%) seems to be counterbalanced by an increase in Al, Si, and Mg concentrations.\nReading what is able to do EDS we can turn perplexed\nabout what really happened in the experiments by Carpinteri :\n>Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, EDX, or XEDS), sometimes called energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) or energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDXMA), is an analytical technique used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample. It relies on an interaction of some source of X-ray excitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are due in large part to the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure allowing unique set of peaks on its X-ray emission spectrum. …\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-dispersive_X-ray_spectroscopy\n— —\nSo…\nWhat happened?

Carpinteri and his\nparticular piezonuclear claims) that now seems in doubt weight …\nunless extraterrestrial beings have really suggested to De Liso\n the right way in order to go towards the Truth …\nIn the past De Liso was defined by Garlaschelli\n(link: http://www.uaar.it/news/2014/02/17/sindone-terremoti-intervento-luigi-garlaschelli/\nas “soprano, painter, former sighting of aliens, now become\nexperimental sindonologist…”\n(Italian words = “soprano, pittrice, ex-avvistatrice di alieni, ora diventata\nsindonologa sperimentale”…).\nNow I want to clarify that I do not want to judge a researcher\n(Giovanna De Liso) for her claims about UFOs, abductions, etc.\nUnfortunately I had only exchanged few words with her in 2002\n(near Paris).  I have only taken note of what was written by\nprof. Luigi Garlaschelli (and then echoed by Nicolotti)…\nWas (an is) our humanity driven by extraterrestrial beings?\nMaybe it was better to believe the good angels,\nthem there were not deceiving.\nHowever I think it would be better not come to confusion between extraterrestrials and angels (= pure spirits) … these are special topics.\nWhat drove Carpinteri to pursue a nuclear physics research deemed\nimpossible by the rest of the scientific community in no time losing\nthe authority conquered in a good career?\nThe piezonuclear question seemed to be very controversial\nalso because De Liso said (in an italian webpage),\nin a letter published in November 15, 2012 :\n “… we have seen neutron detectors, which marked the presence\nof neutrons at the time of rupture of gneiss …\nLink:\nhttp://oggiscienza.it/2012/10/25/istituto-nazionale-di-ricerca-in-misterologia/\n… and I have read on the Web that Giovanna de Liso\nwas also named as an expert in ufology and collaborator\nof CUN (a Italian National “UFO Center”).\n-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-\nIn any case the Luserna Stone (Pietra di Luserna)\n>is a leucogranitic orthogneiss, characterized by a micro-Augen texture, with a marked foliation that is mostly associated to a visible lineation: it geologically pertains to the Dora-Maira Massif, and outcrops in a quite large area (approximately 50 km2) of the Cottian Alps, on the border between the Turin and Cuneo provinces (Piemonte, Italy)…\nLink:\nhttp://www.researchgate.net/publication/259080763_Quantitative_phase_analysis_(QPA)_of_the_Luserna_Stone\nBTW:\nI remember that years ago I have read a study about:\n“Fine atomic image of mica cleavage planes obtaiend with an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a novel procedure for image processing”\nAbstract:\n>Potassium layers and basal oxygen layers in muscovite and biotite cleavage planes were clearly discerned by an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a novel procedure for image processing. Unit cell sizes of muscovite and biotite determined by this procedure were in good accordance with those determined by X-ray structural analysis. Expected differences in the structures of muscovite and biotite, that is, the atomic arrangement of oxygen in the tetrahedral sheet, were clearly demonstrated from the processed images. \nNow I doubt that this technique may serve to then be able to gain more control over what is left after the fracturing process…\nPerhaps one can try to do some new controls on biotite cleavage planes\nin order to better investigate the negative problems already seen with EDS.\n-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-\nHere another question about the use of microscopy…\nbut about Charles Freeman and\nnot regarding De Liso or Carpinteri:\nI think Charles should consider the following fact: Prof. P.

As evoked by the Greek root of the word, they are caused by pressure waves, in both liquids and solids. The salient results, which have already appeared in authoritative international journals of experimental physics or mechanics, provide direct and indirect evidence of the occurrence of piezonuclear reactions. Indirect evidence includes the neutron emissions that have been detected in a regular and reproducible fashion using different types of detector. Direct evidence of piezonuclear reactions was obtained through a brand-new spectroscopic technique,\nEDS, which, by comparing a statistically significant number of spots lying on the outer surface or the fracture faces of the granite specimen, and aiming directly on the only two iron ores present – Phengite and Biotite – was able to ascertain that iron, on average, was locally reduced by 25% and was replaced with atoms of aluminium (atomic number =13, half that of iron), silicon (atomic number =14) and magnesium (atomic number =12). Thus, the split was symmetrical in the case of aluminium, asymmetrical in the other instances.\nIf these reactions can take place in a laboratory, where pressure and temperature conditions are much lower and, especially, the masses at play are much smaller than those found in the deep layers of the earth’s crust, they are bound to take place on a much larger scale within the latter, triggered by fracturing and crushing phenomena of seismic and tectonic origin. On the other hand, neutron fluxes up to a thousand times the natural background level may be detected before and during earthquakes, including medium magnitude ones. … … etc. … … etc.\nLink:\nhttp://www.jacques-benveniste.org/coherence_15_ottobre_2013_Roma-CIRPS.pdf\n— — —\nHugh,\nI want to emphasize that I am not a fan of science fiction or pseudoscience,\nI just want to see what’s true around the world …\nIf someone tells me that there are “chemical proofs” that confirm the piezonuclear transformation of biotite and phengite, then I can believe what he says.\nInstead if I was duped by false chemical tests, then this is another question …\nThese are the terms of the problem, IMO.\n— —\nThen we have to read  the following paper:\n“Comments on ‘Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s Crust’ by A.

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a promising technique for the detection of these materials, yet concerns over the sensitivity of SERS spectra of dyes to chemical and instrumental variables (such as pH, choice of SERS substrates and/or aggregants, and excitation wavelength) have prevented its widespread use in analytical applications. Over the last few years, the development of several microanalytical approaches has considerably increased the chances of success in the identification of minute amounts of dyes by SERS. However, the need for searchable databases is still largely to be fulfilled. In this work, we have assembled the core of a comprehensive library which contains 100 Raman and SERS reference spectra of natural and synthetic organic colorants. Experiments to classify 20 query SERS spectra of dyes from a variety of museum objects were conducted using principal component analysis (PCA) and the correlation coefficient (CC) algorithm. … etc. … etc. …\nAnal.

As I first asked on this blog [message dated September 8, 2015] we can read a comment connected to the interesting (and, perhaps, controversial…) book by William Meacham …\nHere what I wrote [September 8, 2015]:\n>Anyway, we can also try to consider what Prof. William Meacham wrote in the book: “The Rape of the Turin Shroud:\nHow Christianity’s most precious relic was wrongly condemned, and violated” (= That book describes the two major fiascos to have afflicted the Turin Shroud in recent years: the C-14 dating of 1988 and the so-called “restoration” of 2002…)…\nWe can remember that previously unpublished photographs of the Shroud, taken by STURP using Quad-Mosaic Photography (state-of-the-art NASA technology) at the time, were published in the scientific journal “Chemistry Today” by Marino and Benford in 2008 in a paper entitled “Discrepancies in the Radiocarbon Dating Area of the Turin Shroud”\nand\nthe fact that these “unpublished photographs of the Shroud” showed “anomalies in the radiocarbon sample area”…\n(see, for example, the paper by Mark Oxley under the address: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf and the paper by Barrie Schwortz: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf.).\nBut the issue turned as another controversial proof…\nThen I think we have to solve an interesting “Four-corner and center (of the Shroud) [UV Photographs]” problem!\nWell.  How to exit from that conundrum?\nNow I ask:\n1- Is it possible to photograph the sample from the so-called “reserve” using ultraviolet fluorescence photography?\n2- Is it possible to photograph (another time) the Shroud using ultraviolet fluorescence photography?\n3- Is it possible  to photograph the Shroud sample of Arizona using ultraviolet fluorescence photography?\nIs too difficult to obtain the permission to do all these simple works?\nIn that case we still can think to start trying the checks after a positive answer only to the questions number 1 and 3… (and also this work it’s obviously feasible only with inherent permissions).\nBut (probably) we still require another check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud (as main reference) because the controls, without the adequate reference (= the check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud), seems to be a bit inconclusive … or …Would we retain the old UV data (from the main body of the Shroud) as useful reference?\nIn any case if Prof. Jull (of the University of Arizona) want be gentle with us and provide us the useful UV photograph for Arizona sample, that fact will be an interesting “great progress”.\nBut this is not a great progress.\nSo…\nI think we can try to reflect how to write a Plan to submit to the attention of Prof. Jull.\nAnother thing:  don’t like mass spectrometry and I prefer non destructive analyses…\nIs that preliminar work on that Arizona sample too difficult? Only “SPMs-utopia”?\n— — —\n… And, at the end, I want to remember that there exist Alternative Methods for Dating the Shroud… that\n(probably) can break all the vain claims.\n\n","date":"September 10, 2015 at 9:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/09/significant-response-to-the-preview-of-the-thermochimica-acta-editorial/","cat":"article","title":"Significant Response to the Preview of the Thermochimica Acta Editorial"},{"author":"piero","post":"Colin,\nThanks for the link:\nhttp://www.andertoons.com/easter/cartoon/6573/put-them-in-one-basket-on-purpose-like-to-live-dangerously\n— —\nYou wrote:\n“It’s unwise to invest all one’s hopes and dreams into any one single approach that if as yet untried and untested may not deliver the desired answer”\nYes.\nBut …\nAs you have seen AFM was not the unique technique involved…\n\n","date":"February 13, 2015 at 11:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’"},{"author":"piero","post":"I have just read the following strange words:\n>… two crude pamphlets produced in 1992 – 1993 by one Carlos Evaristo, an obscure young man from Portugal who claims to have interviewed Sister Lucy on two different occasions in her cloistered convent.\n>According to Evaristo, during these two “interviews” Sister Lucy essentially retracted everything she had said about the Message of Fatima during the previous 75 years. …\n>… …Evaristo has published the interviews in the form of two pamphlets, entitled Two Hours with Sister Lucy and It All Started with Two Hours with Sister Lucy.

The research includes three new tests, two chemical ones and one mechanical one. The first two were carried out with an FT-IR system, so using infra-red light, and the other using Raman spectroscopy. The third was a multi-parametric mechanical test based on five different mechanical parameters linked to the voltage of the wire. The machine used to examine the Shroud’s fibres and test traction, allowed researchers to examine tiny fibres alongside about twenty samples of cloth dated between 3000 BC and 2000 AD.\nThe new tests carried out in the University of Padua labs were carried out by a number of university professors from various Italian universities and agree that the Shroud dates back to the period when Jesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem. Final results show that the Shroud fibres examined produced the following dates, all of which are 95% certain and centuries away from the medieval dating obtained with Carbon-14 testing in 1988: the dates given to the Shroud after FT-IR testing, is 300 BC ±400, 200 BC ±500 after Raman testing and 400 AD ±400 after multi-parametric mechanical testing. The average of all three dates is 33 BC  ±250 years. The book’s authors observed that the uncertainty of this date is less than the single uncertainties and the date is compatible with the historic date of Jesus’ death on the cross, which historians claim occurred in 30 AD.\nThe tests were carried out using tiny fibres of material extracted from the Shroud by micro-analyst Giovanni Riggi di Numana who passed away in 2008 but had participated in the1988 research project and gave the material to Fanti through the cultural institute Fondazione 3M.\nSource : http://frbkirk.wordpress.com/\n\n","date":"March 27, 2013 at 10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/26/new-italian-book-the-mystery-of-the-shroud-by-giulio-fanti-and-saverio-gaeta/","cat":"books","title":"New Italian Book: The Mystery of the Shroud by Giulio Fanti and Saverio Gaeta"},{"author":"piero","post":"I indicated the DHM (= Digital Holography Microscope) in order to investigate\nthe pollen.

The IMS was designed and built by the authors and the DMA instrument was produced by TA Instrument Co (USA). Because different methods are applied for determination of the dynamic Young’s modulus it was necessary to perform a comparison analysis of the results received from the IMS and DMA, which are currently the most frequently used testers. This analysis shows that an IMS can be used when a DMA cannot be applied. The parameter set comprising the dynamic Young’s modulus for longitudinal vibrations can find application in material engineering in industry. The DMA method does not require the application of mathematical formulas to determine Young’s modulus but requires calibration as apposed to IMS. Measurements of the elasticity modulus were carried out under automatically stabilised climatic conditions. The compliance of the results obtained allows us to evaluate positively the performance of the Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer. Comparison of the results makes it possible to determine the measuring possibilities of the DMA and IMS and show the advantages of IMS over DMA.\n — —\nWhat is your opinion ?\nProbably we can work (with a particular device)\nusing a single linen fibril …\n— —\nDo you know Structural Mechanics ?\nThere is the three-point bending test with an AFM apparel that is an interesting way to use.\nIn my opinion this is the way to know the answer\nfrom the linen fibrils.\n— —\nI hope in your reply …\n\n","date":"March 26, 2013 at 9:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/26/new-italian-book-the-mystery-of-the-shroud-by-giulio-fanti-and-saverio-gaeta/","cat":"books","title":"New Italian Book: The Mystery of the Shroud by Giulio Fanti and Saverio Gaeta"},{"author":"piero","post":"I have a doubt about the possible transformation\n(during the Resurrection) of the water trapped\ninto the cellulosic chains …  !!!\nSorry…\nI hope to read (once more) something on that book.\n\n","date":"December 13, 2013 at 1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/please-only-discuss-michael-judes-book-and-claims-here/","cat":"books","title":"Please Only Discuss Michael Jude’s Book and Claims Here"},{"author":"piero","post":"Personally I have found very interesting the solution against\nthe old carbon dating for the Shroud (the results of 1988,\ncoming from  the 14C test) = the numismatic dating of the Shroud!\nNo one had ever written in such detail on the question of\nprobability calculus based on careful observations of\nByzantine coins, etc. and then I think this is certainly\na great merit of Professor Giulio Fanti …\nSo, our friend Charles Freeman has to work in order to show\nwhere is the error … because this numismatic dating is also\nagainst the strange ideas shown by Charles Freeman.\nI have also found a bit strange that Dr. John Jackson (…or Dr. Whanger …)\nhas never published something of strictly similar about\nthe interesting numismatic dating of the Shroud.\nAttention, please: here I was not talking about the controversial\nissue of the alleged coins on the eyes of the Man of the Shroud,\ninstead I was talking of facial features found in Byzantine coins\nand inherent numismatic dating (for the Shroud of Turin)…\n\n","date":"July 1, 2015 at 11:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/01/quoting-john-jackson-chapter-21-verses-24-and-25/","cat":"books","title":"Quoting John Jackson Chapter 21 Verses 24 and 25"},{"author":"piero","post":"Bleaching with sodium hypochlorite \nThe high reactivity of this bleaching agent imposes softer operative conditions than hydrogen peroxide (pH 9 – 11 and temperatures not above 30 ºC).

The introduction of the confocal design in most Raman spectrometers represents the latest advance in the field of instruments for Raman spectroscopy. It is the basis of new applications in the field of Raman microprobing and improvements in Raman imaging techniques. The basic principle of confocal microscopy is reviewed and its extension to Raman spectroscopy is discussed in terms of improved depth resolution which results in better background discrimination. A new concept of Raman imaging is also presented which benefits from the confocal system and overcomes most of the limitations of direct imaging techniques. A dual fibre-optic remote analysis scheme is described which has been developed to optimize the collection of the scattered light while minimizing the interference from the optical fibres. .\n— — — *** — —\nB.T.W. :\nDo you know the Polarized Raman Microspectroscopy?\n\n","date":"August 25, 2014 at 10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"author":"piero","post":"Try to consider:\nRaman-AFM and nano-Raman (TERS)…\nSee under the address:\nhttp://www.horiba.com/us/en/scientific/products/raman-spectroscopy/raman-afm-and-nano-raman/configuration/\nConfigurations for Raman-AFM and TERS imaging …\n\n","date":"August 26, 2014 at 5:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"author":"piero","post":"I want to clarify:\nObviously ATR-FTIR is not a scanning probe microscopy…\n— —\nIf you want to improve the knowledges there is the following link:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrational_analysis_with_scanning_probe_microscopy\n>… …In 2007, AFM was combined with infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) spectroscopy to study the dissolution process of urea in a cyclohexane/butanol solution with a high spatial resolution. \nand there is the following way:\n> AFM/FTIR setup\n>Spatial resolution\n>The spatial resolution of an AFM/FTIR instrument is related to the contact area between the probe and sample\nBut, typically, an AFM/FTIR has a resolution of “only” 50–400 nm, for example, 100 nm…\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 8:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/03/nine-selected-and-revised-papers-from-the-bari-conference/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Nine Selected and Revised Papers from the Bari Conference"},{"author":"piero","post":"All very interesting.\nBut no one has used advanced microscopy,\nscanning probe microscopies (SPMs) …\n(apart the “Opto-chemical analysis” with ATR-FTIR, then see the paper by Fanti:\n“Optical features of flax fibers coming from the Turin Shroud”,  link:\nhttp://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2015/02/shsconf_atsi2014_00004.pdf )\nPLM (Polarized Light Microscopy) and IR Raman analysis (see the same paper by prof.

We show that, using this device, the evanescent field, obtained by total internal reflection conditions in a prism, can be visualized by approaching the surface with the scanning tip. Fur-thermore, we were able to obtain simultaneous AFM and SNOM images of a standard test grating in air and in liquid.\n>The lateral resolution in AFM and SNOM mode was estimated to be 45 and 160 nm, respectively.\n>This new probe overcomes a number of limitations that commercial probes have, while yielding the same resolution. © 2014 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (060.2310) \nFiber optics; (180.4243) Near-field microscopy; (180.5810) Scanning microscopy; (060.2370) Fiber optics sensors. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) instruments are widely recognized as valuable tools for characterizing physical, chemical, electrical, electrochemical, and optical properties of materials at the nanometer scale.\n>Atomic force microscopy (AFM), for example, is routinely used to map the surface topography with a resolu-tion well beyond the optical limit, both in gaseous and liquid environments\n>By replacing the standard AFM cantilever with a tipped glass fiber, one can then equip the instrument with scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) capabilities. The latter can provide information on the optical field emerging from the sur-face of the sample with a lateral resolution of a few tens of nanometers.\n>The combination of AFM and SNOM has found applications in many fields, including cell biology and single molecule experiments.\n>Unfortunately, current AFM – SNOM probes come with some limitations. In the most widely used setups, the scanning fiber is glued to one of the two prongs of a piezoelectric tuning fork that cannot be immersed in conductive liquids\n>To obtain an image of a solid sur-face in a liquid environment, one thus needs to ensure the tuning fork is kept out of the immersion bath\n> In this configuration, the meniscus of the liquid on the fiber may influence the performance of the probe. Furthermore, tuning forks cannot be used in contact with the sample, hampering any possibility to perform contact mode scan-ning. This restriction can be overcome by replacing the probe with a tipped fiber bent in the form of a cantilever.\n>The position of the cantilever can then be monitored via an optical triangulation readout\n>Alternatively, a standard silicon AFM cantilever can be modified for near-field imaging by making a small hole at the tip apex\n>These configurations also facilitate experiments in liquids, but add the nuisance of the alignment procedure of the readout, which becomes even more tedious when the probe is immersed in a fluid.\n>In an earlier attempt to solve these technical issues, in 2001, Minh et al. presented a probe that could detect the SNOM signal via a hollow micromachined cantilever glued on top of an optical fiber\n>In 2011, we proposed to skip the gluing step by directly carving the cantilever out of the cleaved end of the fiber, which also adds the possibility to measure the cantilever deflection using fiber interferometry.

S.\nAccording to Benedict XVI, the dehellenization of Christianity has had three waves throughout history.\nIn one of these (the second), Harnack was pushing for the simply return to the man Jesus and to his simple message, underneath the accretions of theology and, indeed, of hellenization:\nand thus\nit would be this simple message which would constitute, according to Harnack, the culmination of the religious development of humanity…\n— —\nAdolf von Harnack,  in full Adolf Karl Gustav von Harnack\n(born May 7, 1851, Dorpat, Estonia, Russian Empire [now Tartus, Estonia]—died June 10, 1930, Berlin, Germany). \n>… Harnack’s most famous work, Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (1886–89; The History of Dogma), is a monument of liberal Christian historiography.\n>In this work, Harnack traced the origin and development of Christian dogma, which he understood to be the authoritative system of Christian doctrine that had formed by the 4th century AD.\n>His thesis was that Christian dogma in its conception and development is a work of the Hellenistic Greek spirit based on the Gospel of Jesus in the New Testament.\n>According to Harnack, the process begun at the Protestant Reformation—the overcoming of dogma by a recovery of the essence of the Gospel—should be completed, and the historical-critical approach would achieve this. Harnack defended this position in his most popular book, Das Wesen des Christentums (1900; What Is Christianity?), which was the transcript of a course of lectures he had delivered at the University of Berlin.\n>Harnack’s other major works are Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur bis Eusebius (1893–1904; The History of Ancient Christian Literature) and Die Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten (1902; The Mission and Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries). He was the chief editor of a critical edition of The Greek-Christian Authors of the First Three Centuries (1891– ).\n>He also published numerous monographs on the New Testament and on the doctrines and institutions of the ancient church.\n>In all these works, Harnack tried to show how the Gospel of Jesus, which in his view has nothing in common with authoritarian ecclesiastical statutes and doctrines, became embodied in the doctrines of the church. He also expressed the conviction that, if Christianity is to retain its power in the modern world, it must be freed from any connection with the dogmas of God and Christ with which it became identified to survive in the Hellenistic world. …\nLink:\nhttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/255617/Adolf-von-Harnack\nInstead regarding Schnackenburg\nI have found an italian article by Nobile Marco,\n“Recensione: Rudolf Schnackenburg, La persona di Gesù Cristo nei quattro vangeli”, published in Antonianum, 71/2 (1996) p. 357 .\nLink: http://www.antonianum.eu/2/rivista_bibliografiaViewnota.php?id=2070\nHere an excerpt (rough translation):\n>This monograph on the person of Jesus is neither a research on the historical Jesus, how he wanted the Leben-Jesuforschung of some decades ago, neither wants to take up the question about the relationship between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith of the primitive community Kerygmatic . S. performs an act brave and sensible, which implies that the problem around the type of relationship between the Jesus of history and faith, is a false problem. When searching for the historical identity of Jesus Christ, you have access to only the gospels. Now, these are undoubtedly the projection of a truly historical entity and identity, however incontrovertible that basis is available only in the mediation offered by the long and complex tradition of primitive communities and, ultimately, its crystallization editorial work of the evangelists. When, then, we want to answer the question “Who was Jesus Christ?”, We as the only source of the four gospels, which make theologically significant historical event that occurred two thousand years ago with the appearance of the Rabbi of Nazareth, who, no reaction hermeneutics of the early church, it would be a historical phenomenon among others.

The dynamic response of the tip includes the complex tip–surface interactions due to the surface properties. We found that conventional tapping mode had a limitation in the accurate set-point control on soft and high adhesion surfaces. This study employed the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based AFM microcantilever characterization method to estimate the surface property with more reliable control. The POD extracted the dominant empirical modes of the AFM microcantilever during tapping and scanning on the surface. Also the corresponding eigenvalues represented the significance of the empirical modes and the characteristic features of the nanoscale surface property. This experimental approach can offer a new insight on the novel application of nanoscale surface property estimation in dynamic AFM applications.  … …\n\n","date":"January 13, 2015 at 12:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"author":"piero","post":"I believe that … it would have been interesting if Fanti had contralateral parallel fibrils also from Sudarium of Oviedo …\n\n","date":"January 14, 2015 at 6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"author":"piero","post":"I must warn our readers that what had appeared a few hours ago was near wrong …  (=  contralateral parallel fibrils = !!!?!?!?!)\nIn fact I  was in a hurry and I wrote quickly.\nSo what I wanted to say is that it would be interesting if Eng.

Kazarian\nAbstract:\n>The potential of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) imaging for the characterisation of the chemical components of paint cross sections from old master paintings was investigated. Three cross sections were chosen to cover a variety of the analytical problems encountered in samples from paintings. The binding medium and degradation products in a green paint sample from a fifteenth-century Florentine painting were imaged, as well as a thin layer within a cross-section from a fifteenth-century German painting, and multiple thin surface coatings on a painting of the 1760s by Peter Romney. The application of chemometric methods for further analysis of the large data set generated for each sample was also explored. The study demonstrated the advantages of ATR-FTIR imaging, which allowed images to be obtained with high spatial resolution (ca. 3–4 μm) without the need to microtome the sample. The gain in sensitivity in detecting trace materials and the information derived from the location of these compounds in the sample was especially valuable, improving interpretation of the FTIR analysis and extending knowledge of the sample composition beyond that obtainable with other analytical techniques.\nLink:\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-008-2092-y\n— — —\nHere another study (not on linen, but about the paper!):\nAncient and modern paper characterization by FTIR and Micro-Raman spectroscopy\nVito Librando, Zelica Minniti, Salvatore Lorusso\nConservation Science in Cultural Heritage\n(Quaderni di Scienza della Conservazione) \nLink:\nhttp://conservation-science.unibo.it/article/view/2700\nhttp://link.springer\n— — —\nHere the other way:\n“AFM CFM chemometric methods”\n= CFM consists of measuring the interaction forces between a modified “functionalized” tip and a surface by using atomic force microscopy (AFM).\n— —\n>CFM has been primarily developed by Charles Lieber at Harvard University in 1994.\nLink:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_force_microscopy\n— —\n>CFM measures the chemical interactions between functionalized tips and sample to determine the chemical nature of surfaces and facilitate studies of chemical bonding enthalpy and surface energy.

Normally, glyoxylate is converted to the amino acid glycine or to a compound called glycolate through the action of two enzymes, alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, respectively. Mutations in the AGXT or GRHPR gene cause a shortage of these enzymes, which prevents the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine or glycolate. As levels of glyoxylate build up, it is converted to oxalate. Oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate deposits, which can damage the kidneys and other organs.\nLink:\nhttp://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/primary-hyperoxaluria\nSo we should investigate the genetic issue.

We investigate whether the recognition of facial composites, or pictures of criminal faces, could be similarly enhanced. In this study, participants first estimated the degree of caricature necessary to make composites most identifiable. Contrary to expectation, an anticaricature was found to be best, presumably as this tended to reduce the appearance of errors. In support of this explanation, more positive caricature estimates were assigned to morphed composites: representations that tend to contain less overall error. In addition, anticaricaturing reduced identification for morphed composites but enhanced identification for individual composites. Although such improvements were too small to be of value to law enforcement, a sizeable naming benefit was observed when presenting a range of caricature states, which appeared to capitalize on individual differences in the internal representation of familiar faces.\n— — —\nHere a question:\nIs the caricature a key to understand the strange Manoppello’s Veil?\n— — —\nHere (obviously) I have kept aside the controversial issue of the two\nancient Roman coins (… that with the Sudarium of Oviedo have nothing to do !!!).\n\n","date":"February 12, 2015 at 8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"},{"author":"piero","post":"In principle I am opposed to dating\nwith the C14 because this is a destructive method.\nWe should be careful in the analysis of the two relics.\nHere’s an example: what do we know\nusing the method of C14 about the differences\n(if they really exist) between the blood\non the Shroud and that of the Sudarium of Oviedo?\nLink:\nhttp://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=61556\nHere I wanted to link the words about\nbloodstains with the last interesting work\nby\nAdrie A.

An analysis of the imprint of the sole of the right foot shows two nails were driven into it: one between the second and third metatarsal and another at heel level which other academics had not spotted clearly. …\nLink:\nhttp://www.lastampa.it/2014/05/07/vaticaninsider/eng/world-news/new-study-shows-man-of-the-shroud-had-dislocated-arms-dsfGr2euXrvlxBASsEwi1M/pagina.html\n\n","date":"December 3, 2015 at 11:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"author":"piero","post":"I don’t understand the reason for continue the omission about the link:\nhttps://dailyem.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/not-just-an-footankle-sprain-lisfranc-injurie\nI do not want a repetition for the image!\n\n","date":"December 3, 2015 at 11:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"author":"piero","post":"Do you know Infrared & Raman Users Group?\n>IRUG is a community that encourages\nthe sharing of high quality comparative\nreference spectral data….\nLink:\nhttp://www.irug.org/\nThen, see also the\n“Proceedings of the Sixth Infrared\nand Raman Users Group\nConference (IRUG6)”\n[organized by Istituto di Fisica Applicata\n“Nello Carrara” IFAC – CNR]\nFlorence, Italy\nMarch 29 – April 1, 12004\nSERS and madder:\n>M.
