It suffered more when some supposed filamentous bacteria pointed out by Garza Valdez were reclassified as ultimate threads from the linen fibrils, and more still when it was realised that bacteria and fungi are heterotrophic and, since all their carbon would be derived from what they ate (the shroud), the radiocarbon date would not be affected by them anyway. However it is not impossible that some bacterial contamination of the shroud may have affected its chemical composition. I have know the untenable Dr.Garza Valdes’s arguments about the Shroud radiocarbon dating (also) because in March 2004 I have bought “The Orphaned Manuscript” by Alan Adler (Dorothy Crispino editor, first edition : 2002) and then I know what you wrote about the question.

Then, I would suggest, as possible “detection system”, the use of Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) for thin film analysis (see also: thin layers on linen fibrils…). In other words, in my opinion, a set of ATR FTIR controls can show us something of interest… And, if you want to be more exact in your controls, then you can try to do something using SP Ms techniques. In any case I believe we can easily show what are the true effects of Neutron Radiation on Linen… We alrerady know that Dr. Ray Rogers wrote: “…Direct comparison between image and non image parts of the shroud show exactly the same amounts and types of radiation damage in the two types of areas … >…This suggests that the image was not produced by any mechanism that involved heat, light, or ionizing radiation… Link: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers8.pdf We have also to remember what Gonella said (Symposium of Villa Gualino, Turin) about particular claims on radiations… In any case we can test the linen materials submitted to the neutron irradiations and we can measure the different mechanical effects with comparisons (see also: AFM three point bending tests, etc.). Esteemed Robert Rucker, What is your answer ? As you have previously read I think it’s possible to work in this textile field with useful comparisons.

In the past I received a sample (linen) treated with myrrh and aloe. But I have not controlled in a careful manner this sample … I simply remember the stiffeness of that sample in comparison with “nornal linen” (here I refer to linen samples by Piero Vercelli). So … Starching and wrinkling experiments (and observations on shrivelled aspect of linen) are the works necessary in order to understand the issue in a more exact manner (with comparisons). There is also a question connected with starched linen that I never read in papers. Here the terms of the problem : the bloodstains, the different level of starching and the colorimetric evaluations based on differences of color (= delta E)… and see also : the experiments about the shape of bloodstains as connected to the level of starching (here the question written in other words : banding phenomenon and intensity of bloodstains). As you can easily see these are works (of precision) and no person want to work on less important things … All the people (included myself) want to easily reach fame and clamour ! Instead little works are discarded as useless … Now, let me ask to you : Where is the other (ancient) example for starch put on warp threads to protect them during the weaving ?

Summary >Bilirubin I Xa photooxidation products were detected by high performance liquid chromatography in the urine of neonates undergoing phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia. The in vivo photoproducts were identified by chromatographic comparison with authentic synthetic standards using two complementary methods. >Bilirubin photooxidation products were not detected in urine from jaundiced infants not receiving phototherapy. The specific photoproducts identified in the urine include propentdyopents, hematinic acid imide and its hydrolysis product (3 carboxy 2 methyl 2 hexenedioic acid), and the hydrolysis product (2 vinyl 3 methyl maleic acid) of methylvinylmaleimide. >Their total urinary concentrations were low (0.2 0.9 mg/dl) during phototherapy. These observations show that photooxidation of bilirubin clearly does occur during phototherapy. They are consistent with the view that, although photooxidation is not the major photochemical event associated with phototherapy, it can and clearly does occur concurrently with photoisomerization.

In the liver, uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucuronyl transferase converts bilirubin to a mixture of monoglucuronides and diglucuronides, referred to as conjugated bilirubin, which is then secreted into the bile by an ATP dependent transporter. This process is highly efficient under normal conditions, so plasma unconjugated bilirubin concentrations remain low. >A large number of disease states lead to bilirubin accumulation in plasma. Diseases that increase the rate of bilirubin formation, such as hemolysis, or diseases that reduce the rate of bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome, produce unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Second remark: The CFM (= Chemical Force Microscopy) can be the non destructive solution for identification problems about the compounds deriving from bilirubin degradation.

Hematoidin is formed intracellularly, presumably within reticuloendothelial cells, but is often found extracellularly after 5 7 days in foci of previous hemorrhage.

First of all: the word “terpene” is located at the end of second line (and not “at the end of third line”, as I wrongly wrote) Second correction: >I believed that flax wax was a difficult thing to discover… Instead of: >I believed that flax wax was a difficult to discover… … And as rightly pointed the finger Hugh (in his first message), in the second part of my message I felt into the pitfall: “opportunities for further research” … Instead of discuss the Vanillin test by Roger (= Vanillin loss from Lignin), the Blue Quad Mosaic, the Kodak Panchromatic Separation Film 2238 [and inherent Spectral Sensitivity (at 370 480 nm = positive values.

Problematic materials can be accurately characterized, and correlations can be drawn between changes in ordering at the molecular level. — Vanillin test (or Wiesner test). — I had some doubt about the “Vanillin test” because fungal attacks destroy Lignin, etc. And then the method has the limits if applied to the entire cloth. Here my past opinion: the main way was still the use of AFM, CFM, SNOM = the non destructive controls. — — — The old idea of the NMR, by Giulio Fanti and Ulf Winler was not showed in a clear manner. Have you read the paper by Joseph Virlet (Villa Gualino. 2000) ? He wrote speaking about the intervention by Fanti and Winkler : >This paper, whose intention is laudable, cannot be used as a reference paper. — — — Another thing: I don’t know which kind of lignin biotransformation or what substantial demethoxylation and dehydroxylation of lignin will be possible to see under : natrococcus, natronobacterium, nocardiopsys and synechocystis, etc. (as it was the situation of the TS, for centuries). These microbeings are found by prof. Garza Valdes and Stephen Mattingly… Here another bibliographic reference : Kirk, T.K., Farrell, R.L., (1987). «Enzymatic “combustion” : the microbial degradation of lignin». Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 41: 465 505. Have you read this work ? ——————————————— I remember that Berger wrote : >Rien ne prouve, en effet, que plusieurs espèces chimiques n´interviennent pas dans le processus de dégradation de la lignine, bien au contraire (cf. Test de Wiesner). I believe as interesting remark that I also have read some papers on Wiesner test. Have you tried to understand the matter ? I believed in myself (the simple idea to control the linen fibrils with the SPM microscopy, to develop in a good manner with the pertinent experiments) and I saw too chaos in these “lateral” interesting researches. In my opinion Berger exhibited a partial chemical knowledge when he wrote : >il s’agit bien la d’une méthode totalement nouvelle. >L’auteur ne cite aucune référence antérieure et aucun laboratoire de datation au monde ne propose une telle méthode. Because he don’t know the (possible) use of the Vanillin test in analyses about old books… ————— Have you the entire paper quoted by Berger ? Here the title : O 4 Linked coniferyl and sinapyl aldehydes in lignifying cell walls are the main targets of the Wiesner (phloroglucinol H Cl) reaction. By Pomar F, Merino F, Barcelo AR. (Department of Plant Biology, University of La Coruna, La Coruna). The nature and specificity of the Wiesner test (phloroglucinol H Cl reagent) for the aromatic aldehyde fraction contained in lignins was studied. Phloroglucinol reacted in ethanol hydrochloric acid with coniferyl aldehyde, sinapyl aldehyde, vanillin, and syringaldehyde to yield either pink pigments (in the case of hydroxycinnamyl aldehydes) or red brown pigments (in the case of hydroxybenzaldehydes)… Here an old remark that I have found in my own archive = “Till now I have no exact colorimetric data to do a comparison !” — — I remember to know that Van Haelst together with Dr. M. Cl. Van Oosterwijck did claimed they did some experiments and (if I am right in my memory) R. Van Haelst did proposed the temperature of 180 °C. Later Mario Moroni made about the same experiments. He measured ~180 °C for the place were the samples were taken. And (of course) this is in contradiction with the 25 °C proposed by Rogers. Following Rogers, the low thermal conductivity of linen excluded such a high temperature. But Ray Rogers was unaware of the experiments of Moroni… and then this researcher (Rogers) did not continued further in thermochemical textile research because he died in 2005 … Do you know other details? Under the address : https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/page/5/ there was a long commentary … But without mentioning the question of Vanillin in old books… See for example: That “Old Book Smell” Is a Mix of Grass and Vanilla Smell is chemistry, and the chemistry of old books gives your cherished tomes their scent by Colin Schultz = smithsonian.com (June 18, 2013) Link: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart news/that old book smell is a mix of grass and vanilla 710038/?no ist >Smell is chemistry, and the chemistry of old books gives your cherished tomes their scent. As a book ages, the chemical compounds used—the glue, the paper, the ink–begin to break down. And, as they do, they release volatile compounds—the source of the smell. >A common smell of old books, says the International League for Antiquarian Booksellers, is a hint of vanilla: “Lignin, which is present in all wood based paper, is closely related to vanillin. >As it breaks down, the lignin grants old books that faint vanilla scent.” … etc. … etc. … Here other links: http://www.compoundchem.com/2014/06/01/newoldbooksmell/ >…A study in 2009 looked into the smell of old books, finding that the complex scent was a mix of “hundreds of so called volatile organic compounds (VO Cs) released into the air from the paper,” says the Telegraph. … http://thescienceoffiction.net/tag/the wonder of books/ >… In total, there are hundreds of VO Cs that can contribute to the overall scent of the book in question. However, there are several chemicals that can be both named and attributed to certain fragrances. One you might recognize is vanillin — the same chemical found in artificial vanilla. As you can guess, this contributes to the “hint of vanilla” mentioned by Strlič. A less familiar name (unless you took organic chemistry, or enjoy looking up chemical compounds) is 2 ethyl hexanol. This chemical offers a gentle floral scent. Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin >…(Rogers) stated that: “The fact that vanillin cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of vanillin loss suggest the shroud is between 1300 and 3000 years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years”.[ = Raymond N. Rogers, 2004, Studies on the radiocarbon sample from the shroud of turin, TCA paper] >Rogers concluded from this that the Shroud is much older than the earlier purported estimates… https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/page/5/ >… However, there is another pitfall lurking here if Rogers thought that vanillin was a volatile material, going by the aroma from old wood. That could conceal a major source of error if his sleeping partner, Dr. S.T.Kosiewicz of the title, was not aware of it. … etc. … etc. … >… while the nose can readily detect vanillin at exceedingly low concentrations in air, it’s in fact a white solid with a quite high melting point (82 degrees C). So when Kosiewicz measured remaining “vanillin” (read coniferaldehyde) at 70 degrees C, he would have been measuring some of the vanillin end product that had failed to vaporise, still being a solid with low surface area. But when he raised the temperature to 100 degrees, the vanillin would then be liquid, with a larger surface area, larger vapour pressure, and been able to escape more easily causing less interference in the measurement of remaining “lignin”. You see, the exponential nature of the reaction rate means that any small errors at the higher temperatures is likely to translate into major errors in estimating the tiny rates of decay under normal environmental temperature. >There’s an “if” here, namely that Kosiewicz was measuring lignin by disappearance, using the Wiesner test, rather than some more specific test. But we are not told how he did his chemistry. Thus the title (and chief complaint) of this posting. Since when has it been accepted practice to sub contract vital research to one’s chums, possibly/probably unqualified in the topic of interest, whose data is withheld from publication? So… I do not believe in this type of analysis, however, I also thought of SNOM controls for Wiesner test … See also my post: December 31, 2013 at 9:56 am (Argument to debate = Revisiting Giulio Fanti’s Dating Methods) link: https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/07/revisiting fantis dating methods/ >Vanillin test (= Wiesner test) in itself is not the true solution … The new nondestructive dating technique (that I indicated in 1998) is based on SP Ms (= Scanning Probe Microscopies = AFM, CFM and SNOM ) … — — What is your opinion ? * * * * * * * * Now I wonder to what extent it would be reliable the control of Vanillin (= Wiesner test) after the material of the cloth was sumitted to an indirect treatment (= the one who released thymol)….","date":"2015-03-10","mins":"8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"},{"id":"comment-193127","author":"piero","post":"MPH, You was scathing about Hugh (and the Cotton/Linen fact)… But you have forgotten the past criticism by G. M. Rinaldi regarding the exact statistical question (and a different point of view with respect that of Eng. Brunati, a deceased italian researcher, who [years ago] indicated the same number, your clamorous 1,04% )… Obviously this don’t change the fact that we are dealing with a number below 5%. In other words : the tests must be repeated … with other samples, taking other material from the Shroud. Perhaps, proceeding in this manner we can easily destroy the entire sheet of Turin (!!!) due to the fact that we are often persisted in long discussions about a glass of water or similar things… and therefore the time to be able to plan the work is lost. In order to avoid (to prevent) this nefarious (heinous) perspective we can try to do some interesting non destructive analyses as underlined by prof. Barberis, the director of CIS in Turin… But I am preaching that way since 1998, unfortunately my simple claims […and not “mantra”, as wrote Louis several days ago. See also the “mantra intoning” concept by Colin Berry, January 20, 2015] about the use of SPM [= AFM, CFM and SNOM] are often disregarded. In the paper: “Perspectives for the Future Study of the Shroud”, Valencia 2012, Barberis indicated [at p. 2] the use of AFM, yes… But, in my opinion, this SPM technique is not a “new technology” as he wrote because (since years) there are several papers at disposal [and often you can read what I write taking some (right or wrong) examples from the Web…]. I also understand that several years ago AFM controls on linen (with SSNDT as witnesses) were not famous (Dallas, 2005) probbly because I was not an engineer and I had not a Nano Lab at disposal … Instead after 14 years (= 2012) there was a very little revival for AFM. Strangely prof. Barberis disregarded the useful ATR FTIR, remind the paper by P. Garside [a Research Fellow in Conservation Science, Textile Conservation Centre, Univ. Of Southampton, UK. B.T.W: He also quoted two FTIR papers by J. M. Cardamone (a researcher known to the “Shroudies”), read the Bibliography of the paper related to the Historic Artifacts published in 2001… Not the Perkin Elmer paper, 2011] about a particular version of that technique. Instead he sketched a particular perspective about the “poker holes”. He indicated the following techniques : UV Vis, IR, Raman, TOF SIMS … as useful methodologies to verify the hypothesis that the origin of that famous “L” is not due to combustion, disregarding the AFM and CFM (= Chemical Force Microscopy). And I say these words taking apart the fact that, after the restoring of the year 2002, the inherent area changed (= it became a big hole instead of a little one) if I am right in my remark… After having indicated the idea of these controls on the reminds of the past “L” (= what was the area near the “poker holes”), he suggested the use of mass spectrometry on water marks in order to compare the results with other sites without waterstains. I presume he wanted to indicate the TOF SIMS controls that (unfortunately) aren’t “non destructive controls”… In any case : do you remember the strange question of gamma irradiated samples (that I indicated few days ago) and the interesting changes in water adsorption? Well… this case is near similar our problem (to solve without destructions) … See also: the possible exact interpretation about the inherent “chromatographies” on linen! The AFM techniques can also be useful in the case of the tests “on the Holland cloth and on the patches removed in 2002”. But Barberis indicated only (and vaguely) “spectroscopic tests”… So … What was the meaning of this particular “smoke on our eyes” of the year 2012? How is possible to show a very good project of SPM (Scanning Probe Microscopy) line system on linen without any previous true help from the Laboratories? … — — — — — We have seen the past photographies about the Arizona’s sample = Report on the STERA, Inc. – University of Arizona Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory Macro Photography – 30 August 2012 link: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/arizona.pdf and the observations by Pam Moon and Donna Campbell (“The black thread”) link: http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud of Turin exhibition/Three threads files/Arizona%20for%20website.pdf But all these things are insufficient to emit a verdict. So, in my opinion, we have to test this sample under SPM analyses. Is it possible to contact Dr. Timothy Jull in order to obtain that control or few (very little) linen samples to submit to the SPM tests? If the photographies about the Arizona’s sample were non destructive controls, then the same can happen with tests under AFM techniques… But the advanced analyses on the sample of Arizona may not be sufficient to establish the truth regarding the whole cloth of the Shroud! So we have to do the comparisons with the other linen samples already taken from the Holy Shroud of Turin. … And this is the final sentence of my “analytical sermon”.

Although I had some doubt, the question of Cotton presence into the fibres of linen samples taken from the Shroud is not trivial. In other words : we have to show what kind of blend was produced and then we have not only to find the exact percentage of Cotton versus Linen that was produced but the geometrical distribution of Cotton (along the threads). And this doesn’t seem a very difficult problem to solve. Do you agree with me? A more difficult question to solve is the true identification for the origin (of that presence or subsequent contamination). When can we read only some rough words about “actual threads ” and “cotton fibres twisted among them, in varying proportion” we cannot solve our problem because we don’t know if the distribution was at random or periodical… So… What we require it’s an useful and careful drawing or particular photographs (or both) that can describe the difference Cotton versus Linen (and/or viceversa) and their exact positions, one with respect to other (and the first idea that came into my mind was the use of PLM… But this work has to be obtained from adequate samples, not mechanically damaged, etc.). Probably, using that description, we can draw interesting conclusions from: drawings, photographs or maps. Was Raes able to do that? Here my rough opinion: I don’t believe. I am curious to read your answers about the idea to investigate the issue with an adequate research tool. At the end of this message you can read a very short bibliography and after the inherent readings you can draw your own conclusion about the possibility to identificate the textile materials (Linen and Cotton) in blends.

Where is the “Multivariate analysis of spectroscopic data” ? Sorry. I wrote that because I have read the Abstract of the study : “Application of chemometric analysis to UV visible and diffuse near infrared reflectance spectra.” by Christopher Brent Davis Abstract : >Multivariate analysis of spectroscopic data has become more common place in analytical investigations due to several factors, including diode array spectrometers, computer assisted data acquisition systems, and chemometric modeling software. Chemometric regression modeling as well as classification studies were conducted on spectral data obtained with chili peppers and fabrics samples. Multivariate regression models known as partial least squares (PLS 1) were developed from the spectral data of alcoholic extracts of Habanero peppers. The developed regression models were used to predict the total capsaicinoids concentration of a set of unknown samples. The ability of the regression models to correctly predict the total capsaicinoids concentration of unknown samples was evaluated in terms of the root mean square error or prediction (RMSEP). The prediction ability of the models produced was found to be robust and stable over time and in the face of instrumental modifications. A near infrared spectral database was developed from over 800 textile samples. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the diffuse near infrared reflectance spectra from these commercially available textiles. The PCA models were combined together into a soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) in order to classify the samples according to fiber type. The samples in the study had no pretreatments. The discriminating power of these models was tested by creating validation sets within a given fiber type as well as attempting to classify samples into a category that they do not belong to. The apparent sub class groupings within the same fiber class were investigated as to whether or not they were caused by chemical processing residues, multipurpose finishes, or dyes — — — I hope in other kind of analyses (see, for example, the investigations using the Chemical Force Microscopy) in order to clarify the question … So … What is your answer about the CFM way in comparison with the other ways ?.","date":"2014-01-23","mins":"9:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/22/comment-promoted-are-the-quad-mosaics-meaningless/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted: Are the Quad Mosaics Meaningless?"},{"id":"comment-74392","author":"piero","post":"The first questions to discuss after the proper SPM analyses seems to be the comparison with the exact detection of contaminations and then there is to take into account the question of fungal and bacterial contamination … See, for example, the recent papers by Pam Moon … — — — But, “to begin at the beginning” : … my intervention (in 1998) was temporarily inserted in the field of “Conservation” (because I indicated the ancient plies as interesting areas to control).

The shear lag approach of Cox [Br. J. Appl. Phys. 3 (1952) 72] is investigated for the fibrous network and composite materials.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a non destructive and versatile technique for quantifying 3 D surfaces. The response of measurement quality to variations in CLSM hardware settings and specimen properties has been investigated. >Through these investigations, certain criteria have been developed to select the optimal CLSM settings to minimize image noise, maximize contrast and resolution for reliable and accurate 3 D surface measurements. The surface measurement results were then compared with those obtained from the stylus instrument, phase shifting interferometer (PSI) and the coherence scanning interferometer (CSI). With the optimal hardware settings, CLS Ms proved to be an appropriate instrument for measuring moderately rough to rough surfaces regardless of surface reflectivity or surface finish. >It exhibits versatility for measuring surfaces of complex geometry, which is needed in the engineering field.

The same techniques are, however, not applicable to microscopic drops. Furthermore they do not directly provide a measure of the interfacial stresses arising at the contact area between liquid and solid, which are known to play a key role in the evaporation kinetics of small drops. >Here I show how the use of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers as sensitive stress, mass, and temperature sensors can be employed to monitor the evaporation of microdrops of water.

In this work, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was applied to the analysis of textile fibers dyed with madder from two different botanical species, Oldenlandia umbellata L. And Rubia tinctorum L. >The resulting SERS spectra were interpreted in light of the actual composition of the madder dyes as determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Interestingly, the SERS spectra were found to exhibit very distinctive spectral features depending on the different anthraquinone derivatives present in the dyes. In particular, the SERS spectrum of O. Umbellata L. Was found to match the spectrum of alizarin, while the SERS spectrum of R. Tinctorum L. Was surprisingly dominated by signals due to the less studied anthraquinone compound pseudopurpurin. >With this study, we demonstrate that SERS spectra may offer valuable information regarding the major coloring constituents present in different madder species. >Moreover, our work shows that not only can SERS be used successfully to differentiate among closely related anthraquinone derivatives, but also that this technique is particularly suitable for the detection of pseudopurpurin, leading to the identification of this compound in a number of works of art.

And this is …. An unsolved problem of Archaeological Chemistry : the Shroud/tablecloth hypothesis (formulated by R. And J. Jackson) and inherent lack of chemical evaluations using adequate scientific tools… Yesterday I have reread an old paper by Rebecca and John Jackson : “The Jewish and Early Christian History of the Turin Shroud”. They proposed that the Shroud of Turin, besides being the possible burial cloth of Christ, also served as the tablecloth for the Lord’s Supper. The double usage for the Turin cloth unified two very different liturgical traditions associated with the Mass… : the altar/sacrifical tradition and the Lord’s Supper/meal tradition. They presented a possible evidence found directly on the Shroud itself for the tablecloth hypothesis… Cheroset is eaten using green herbs, then dipping stains might fall onto thr linen and then they also indicated the Gospel (John 13:26), because “dipping is mentioned in the Gospel” (when Jesus offers a little slice of bread, dipped into the wine, to Judas). They discovered drip patterns, adjacent to the legs of the frontal image. Considering the final drip spot at the end of a central linear pattern found at the midpoint of the Shroud, they saw that this drip spot happened to fall within the thermal discoloration zone of the 1532 fire. Also they saw that part of this spot was charred black (obviously by the 1532 fire). Now the problem to solve [after the restore operation (year 2002), etc., etc.] is connected with the pattern of drips found on the Shroud : Is it possible to know (using Raman controls, CFM, etc.) the truth about the origin for these stains ? Are we sure that these drip patterns went into the Shroud before the body and blood images ? Where are our conjectures about useful advanced controls ? Are these controls an useless waste of time or not ? ———————————————————————— In their work the Jacksons indicated that: – Cheroset was a mixture of red wine, nuts and apples. – Cheroset in Passover liturgy symbolizes the nortar that the Israelite slaves used in the construction of bricks for the Pharaoh’s building projects, – Cheroset is a vital element in the Passover “Seder” Liturgy and cannot be deleted or even replacet with another food item [Abarbanel Haggadah, Mesorah Publishers, p. 121) ———————————————————————— Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charoset >Charoset, haroset, or charoses (Hebrew: חֲרֽוֹסֶת [ḥărōset]) is a sweet, dark colored paste made of fruits and nuts eaten at the Passover Seder.

Correlations between the Judaic sources and the Holy Shroud of Turin (Tuesday, August 29, 2000) Link: https://www.shroud.com/orvieto.htm Second: The least squares fitting algorithm is the most commonly used algorithm in Raman spectroscopy.

There is an analogy with “our problem” : the scholarly ambiguities of Descartes illustrate how high the difficulties were : a propagation of light “within an instant” : a very short moment? or an instantaneous phenomenon? In the “Dioptrique” Descartes seems to conclude in favour of an instantaneous propagation (a duration that would be independent of the distance)… … But in a letter to Mersenne he wrote: “I declare contradictory that an infinite velocity may occur in Nature” Source : Costabel, 1978: “La propagation de la lumière sans trasport de matière de Descartes à Huygens”, in Roemer et la vitesse de la Lumière, Paris, Vrin. Creativity and Technology in Experimentation. I understand that an event open to the public in Rome (next workshop at La Sapienza University) is not an Analytical Laboratory and also direct confrontations of scholars having different views is not a Lab team work… Cellulose is synthesized in plant at the cell membrane by an ordered synthase complex by polymerization of glucose residues using beta glycosidic bonds. Nanometer thick crystalline microfibrils have high tensile strength and make up the fundamental structural unit in plant cell walls. There is also a matrix of other polysaccharides that cross link the microfibrils using hydrogen bonding. Then see also the question of “Hydrogen bonding plane”. If I am right Hydrogen bonding play a role in linen material as : – Intramolecular Hydrogen bonding – Intrasheet Hydrogen bonding – Intersheet .Hydrogen bonding. High resolution microscopy provided evidence for the presence of single crystal microfibrils. The nano crystalline cellulose (NCC or CNC) usage as reinforcement in biodegradable polymeric systems is a relatively new field in Nanotechnology … The type of nano crystals obtained from wood have similar properties to carbon nanotubes (CNT) such as stiffness and tensile strength. Their dimension is 2 5 nm x 150 300 nm … The axial modulus of crystalline cellulose is near 150 G Pa which is greater than Kevlar (130 G Pa). Using AFM techniques on linen fibrils we can detect something about structural features and morphology of ancient fibrils is different with respect modern fibrils. AFM force–displacement curves can be obtained by applying a vertical force in direction of CNC diameter (transverse direction). The mechanical properties of CNC (and, for example, mica) are known to be anisotropic. But here I never wrote something about transverse elastic modulus (= differences) or readily accessible surface of strain distorted tilt and twist regions… If the linen fibrils treated with alpha particles are more brittle, then the results obtained from three point (=3 P) bending tests (… or from AFM nanomechanical mapping) will be different with respect the untreated linen material. We can easily measure these differences using the 3 P bending test (or with AFM nanomechanical mapping) Also AFM 3 P bending tests on fibrils can solve in part our burning thirst of knowledge.

It supports and ensures research collaboration between them by launching and managing different types of project calls. Within the EMRP Call 2012 “Metrology for Industry”, the joint research project (JRP) entitled “Multidimensional Reflectometry for Industry” (x D Reflect) was submitted by a consortium of 8 National Metrology Institutes (NM Is) and 2 universities and was subsequently funded. The general objective of x D Reflect is to meet the demands from industry to describe the overall macroscopic appearance of modern surfaces by developing and improving methods for optical measurements which correlate with the visual sensation being evoked. In particular, the project deals with the “Goniochromatism”, “Gloss” and “Fluorescence” properties of dedicated artifacts, which will be investigated in three main work packages (WP). Two additional transversal WP reinforce the structure: “Modelling and Data Analysis” with the objective to give an irreducible set of calibration schemes and handling methods and “Visual Perception”, which will produce perception scales for the different visual attributes. Multidimensional reflectometry involves the enhancement of spectral and spatial resolution of reference gonioreflectometers for BRDF measurements using modern detectors, conoscopic optical designs, CCD cameras, line scan cameras, and modern light sources in order to describe new effects like sparkle and graininess/coarseness.

When an interference pigment is coated on a white surface, he reflection color is seen in the highlight and the transmission color in the background.

Here an example of AFM controls: Quantitative Mapping of the Elastic Modulus of Soft Materials with Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM AFM Modes by Maxim E. Dokukin and Igor Sokolov Abstract >The modulus of elasticity of soft materials on the nanoscale is of interest when studying thin films, nanocomposites, and biomaterials. Two novel modes of atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been introduced recently: Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM. Both modes produce distribution maps of the elastic modulus over the sample surface. Here we investigate the question of how quantitative these maps are when studying soft materials. Three different polymers with a macroscopic Young’s modulus of 0.6–0.7 G Pa (polyurethanes) and 2.7 G Pa (polystyrene) are analyzed using these new modes. The moduli obtained are compared to the data measured with the other commonly used techniques, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), regular AFM, and nanoindenter. We show that the elastic modulus is overestimated in both the Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM modes when using regular sharp probes because of excessively overstressed material in the samples. We further demonstrate that both AFM modes can work in the linear stress–strain regime when using a relatively dull indentation probe (starting from ∼210 nm). The analysis of the elasticity models to be used shows that the JKR model should be used for the samples considered here instead of the DMT model, which is currently implemented in Harmoni X and Peak Force QNM modes. Using the JKR model and∼240 nm AFM probe in the Peak Force QNM mode, we demonstrate that a quantitative mapping of the elastic modulus of polymeric materials is possible. A spatial resolution of ∼50 nm and a minimum 2 to 3 nm indentation depth are achieved.

Then, a case study is presented in which we report the mechanical characterization using both CR AFM and TH AFM of polyaniline and polyaniniline doped with nanodiamond particles tablets prepared by a pressing process. We determined the indentation modulus values of their surfaces, which were found in fairly good agreement, thus demonstrating the accuracy of the techniques.

Under : http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/twell/lab/pollenis/wall I have found an interesting explanation : >In addition to the purely mechanical function of the exine in protecting the reproductive cells from environmental injury, exine sculpturing plays an important role in attachment to insect pollinators and adhesion to the stigmatic surfaces; while wind pollinated species including many grasses and tree species often lack elaborate structure and appear smooth. … … And what is the difference about exine and intine ? >Beneath the exine, which is defined by the presence of one or two basal nexine layers, a second major wall layer surrounds the pollen grain protoplasm termed the intine. While the exine is composed of sporopollenin, a complex and highly resistant biopolymer containing fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, phenolics and carotenoids, the intine is largely composed of pectin and cellulose. … — — Now the problem : How can change over the centuries the material of pollen? — — A previous Boi’s report (Valencia 2012) clearly highlights that the pollen is proof that the shroud, which is kept in Turin, was a winding sheet and was used according to rituals common in the Middle East over a thousand years ago. B.T.W. : Under the address : http://extension.uned.es/actividad/7018 I have found another work by Marzia Boi (Universitat de les Illes Balears), here the title : “Sábana Santa de Turín y Sudario de Oviedo: pruebas científicas del crimen de Jesús de Nazaret”. So … If Max Frei made no attempt to distinguish between anemophilous and entomophilous pollen material, meanwhile, forensic science has progressed. In my previous intervention I remembered that is important to record the nature of pollen grains, the we were not able to deepen the question… If the pollen grains are powdery, dust like, this is an indication about wind pollination. Usually pollen grains are sticky in insect pollinated flowers. So we have to control what are the levels of viscoelasticity and adhesion … I have several doubts about the precision of that control, after the centuries and aging… In my opinion that work is not a nonsensical control and I am still curious about that unsolved question. 4 – In my opinion Giulio Fanti author of the intervention : Optical features of flax fibers coming from the Turin Shroud was able to do something using PLM (= Polarized Light Microscopy) and not with SPM … But I am still curious to follow what are the interesting observations. For now we can imagine something. For example: it is possible to show something about the ancient treatment = the beaten linen fibrils observed in optical field (PLM) … or : Was he able to measure the Viscoelastic Properties through “calibrated optical observations” ? Now remains a curiosity for what we still need to know… 5 – At the end there are the studies about the strange EQ Ls and Earthquakes … = Sky Darkening during Strong Earthquakes as Hypothesis of Earth’s Crust Emission in Holy Shroud Image Study. See, for example, what wrote Fidani : >A seven month collection of testimonials about the 6 April 2009 earthquake in Aquila, Abruzzo region, Italy, was compiled into a catalogue of non seismic phenomena.

Non seismic phenomena are characterized by unusual sounds and light emissions as well as degassing of vast areas near the epicentre with chemical alterations of shallow geosphere (aquifers, soils) and the troposphere.

Also the resurrection in “another universe” (“multiverse”?) seem to be a sort of mocking result… because this new universe can be uncomprehensible for us. This seems to be near a sort of “recycled buddhism” = a rebirth, not in this poor world, but in another universe that can be a bit unknown (So … Is that “universe” the Purgatory? Was the Manoppelo’s Face the message from the journey through the Purgatory? Jesus saved the souls of the Purgatory and this Face is the result of our perception … but we are not yet able to understand the true meaning?). Probably it is better what the Christian Tradition taught, with three different cases : Paradise, Purgatory and Hell… In my opinion we cannot try to compute, microscopically or macroscopically, the power of God Father when He (…with and through the Holy Spirit) resurrected from the death His Son… This is a religious question and (IMO) atoms, nuclear particles, quarks or strings are far from that problem… In any case I am curious to see what kind of results will be obtained from true advanced controls… We can also discuss whether the body has passed through a phase of dematerialization perhaps involving the formation of antimatter or new states of matter, the non ordinary states (with very short life span). But the question for the moment is only completely theoretical. In principle I am opposed to this idea of dematerialization with transient phases. But I can not exclude it, in fact, we have not yet at hand concrete results derived from advanced controls (with SPM, etc.) of those colored thin layers which then form the Body Image on the Shroud. — *** — *** — Penta Quark: particle consisting of five quarks.

Ratcliffe >As part of a Ministry funded inter university Research Project, this workshop was organised to gather together experimentalists and theoreticians engaged in investigating the nature of transverse spin in hadronic physics, with the intent of favouring the exchange of up to date theoretical and experimental ideas and news on the subject. Over 70 physicists took part and very nearly all the major experiments involved in transverse spin studies were officially represented, as too were the main theory groups working in the field. New results and new analyses sparked many interesting and lively discussions. See also: The hexaquark flavoured anti K N N state computed microscopically with a clusterized octoquark. P. Bicudo (Submitted on 13 Apr 2008) The possible production processes of the anti K NN are explored. We derive microscopically, with the RGM, the microscopic derivation of the K N and anti K N interactions. We discuss the binding or not binding of the different anti K N and anti K NN systems. When binding occurs, the respective decay widths are also discussed.

As he was finishing distributing Holy Communion, a woman came up to tell him that she had found a discarded host on a candleholder at the back of the church. On going to the spot indicated, Fr. Alejandro saw the defiled Host. Since he was unable to consume it, he placed it in a container of water and put it away in the tabernacle of the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament. On Monday, August 26, upon opening the tabernacle, he saw to his amazement that the Host had turned into a bloody substance. He informed Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, who gave instructions that the Host be professionally photographed. The photos were taken on September 6. They clearly show that the Host, which had become a fragment of bloodied flesh, had grown significantly in size. For several years the Host remained in the tabernacle, the whole affair being kept a strict secret. Since the Host suffered no visible decomposition, Cardinal Bergoglio decided to have it scientifically analyzed. >On October 5, 1999, in the presence of the Cardinal’s representatives, Dr. Castanon took a sample of the bloody fragment and sent it to New York for analysis. Since he did not wish to prejudice the study, he purposely did not inform the team of scientists of its provenance. One of these scientists was Dr. Frederic Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], the well known cardiologist and forensic pathologist. He determined that the analyzed substance was real flesh and blood containing human DNA. … … >… ..Two Australians, journalist Mike Willesee and lawyer Ron Tesoriero, witnessed these tests. Knowing where sample had come from, they were dumbfounded by Dr. Zugiba’s testimony. Mike Willesee asked the scientist how long the white blood cells would have remained alive if they had come from a piece of human tissue, which had been kept in water. They would have ceased to exist in a matter of minutes, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied. The journalist then told the doctor that the source of the sample had first been kept in ordinary water for a month and then for another three years in a container of distilled water; only then had the sample been taken for analysis. Dr. Zugiba’s was at a loss to account for this fact. There was no way of explaining it scientifically, he stated. Only then did Mike Willesee inform Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!] that the analyzed sample came from a consecrated Host (white, unleavened bread) that had mysteriously turned into bloody human flesh. Amazed by this information, Dr. Zugiba [instead of Dr. F. Zugibe!], replied, “How and why a consecrated Host would change its character and become living human flesh and blood will remain an inexplicable mystery to science—a mystery totally beyond her competence.” Dr. F. Zugibe was a well known sindonologist… Link: http://www.loamagazine.org/nr/the main topic/eucharistic miracle in buenos.html >a journalist reported that miracles had been more than one. The first “signs” occurred “in May 1992, the same month and year that Bergoglio was appointed auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires”, then “24 July 1994 while the minister of the Eucharist took the cup contained in the Tabernacle he noticed that a drop of blood was flowing on the inner wall of the same Tabernacle “and the last, that of 1996 described by Fr. M. Piotrowski, had not happened on August 18 (as erroneously reported) but on the 15th, the Feast of the Assumption Mary into heaven. >After the article by Antonio Socci, a journalist Maurizio Blondet, who had already reported in an article published on the website Effedieffe, he came up with the idea of ​​going personally to Buenos Aires to investigate the events in person and riportarali in a subsequent publication. >Exactly one year later, in March 2014, Blondet went actually in Argentina accompanied by two people, one of which, for the strange coincidences of the case, it is a friend, then a direct witness of what they learned during the ten day stay in Buenos Aires… Source (with rough translation): http://www.circolo latorre.com/home.jsp?idrub=35746 — — — — Other links: http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/mir/english pdf/Turin1.pdf‎ http://www.therealpresence.org/eucharst/mir/english pdf/Turin2.pdf‎ http://www.lamadredellachiesa.it/una clamorosa e sconosciuta serie di miracoli eucaristici a buenos aires con bergoglio vescovo di antonio socci/ — — — Now Pope Francis does not go to Medjugorje … Why?

Rogers and Anna Arnoldi >… Postmortem body temperatures can reach 41ºC (Irvine, 2001), and steep temperature gradients would exist across the cloth as a result of the low thermal diffusivity of linen and theangular dependence of radiant heat flow from a nonmetallic surface (Gubareff et al, 1960). Then they concluded that temperature gradients will have a large effect on Maillard reaction rates and these combination of factors could produce a distribution of reaction products with the appearance of the image. I have pointed out (but a bit in a bad way. Sorry…) the question of urea. In short, I wanted to underline that the cadaveric amines (= putrescine and cadaverine, etc.) are the main candidates (if I am right in my readings) for the famous Maillard reaction indicated by Rogers and Arnoldi (and then we have to see what is the possible role for urea). Link: in https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers7.pdf. >Ever since the French chemist Louis Camille Maillard studied the metabolism of urea and kidney illnesses and published his thesis on the actions of glycerin and sugar on amino acids in 1913, the Maillard reaction has been a hot research topic. A review on browning reactions in dehydrated foods, which appeared in the first volume of Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, remains the most cited paper in that journal’s history. Link: http://blog.khymos.org/2012/06/04/maximizing food flavor by speeding up the maillard reaction/ Here what wrote Thibault Heimburger: >…Much has been made of ammonia being produced from sweat by hydrolysis of urea (H2 NCONH2). >CO2 (and some carbamates) is the other final product. I have not been able to find any sweat analysesthat showed urea as a major component. In any case, the reaction would be over in a few hours.Ammonia would leave a fog of color on the cloth, because it diffuses quite rapidly. >The image was notprimarily formed by ammonia. The fog around the nose and mouth looks to me like some ammonia was involved (“I think I see”). — — — I believe you have to read the document: by Ray Schneider http://www.shrouduniversity.com/Handouts/LLI Shroud Pt4 Skeptics&Image.pdf Here what is explained in the document (at p 59 of 65) by Ray Schneider: “Coronal Discharge” Professor Giulio Fanti believes that coronal discharge could explain the shroud image. – Giulio has done a lot of good science – Coronal Discharge requires very high voltages * * * * * * * * * * * * * And, at the end, some words about the strange theories… See for example: Here the words by Prof. Gonella during Villa Gualino’s Meeting (in 2000): “…As for the neutron bombardment, skipping any comment on the weird idea of a nuclear physics of Resurrection, as a nuclear physicist I can assure you that the exposure of cellulose to a fast neutron fluence big enough to cause the required enrichment in 14 C would play such a havoc with the hydrogen atoms to cause chemical changes visible to the naked eye (and this too can be easily checked). …” Here the words by Prof. Luigi Gonella (title = “Discussant’s contribution”) during the famous Meeting in Villa Gualino, Turin (in 2000): “…As for the neutron bombardment, skipping any comment on the weird idea of a nuclear physics of Resurrection, as a nuclear physicist I can assure you that the exposure of cellulose to a fast neutron fluence big enough to cause the required enrichment in 14 C would play such a havoc with the hydrogen atoms to cause chemical changes visible to the naked eye (and this too can be easily checked). …” So… It’s easily understandable that my old idea (written by myself in my intervention paper for Dallas 2005) to use the AFM controls and the SSNTD witnesses during adequate experimental simulations perhaps should have had also this reference (… thinkable as an authoritative reference) in the paper (a simple thing that I didn’t do, if I well remember…)… otherwise that idea was judged a simple and useless joke (and now I write this with reference what wrote Prof. Gonella). Unfortunately we have seen some recent interesting or strange papers (an example: Jeffrey Skurka…) where this argument (= AFM sperimental controls on irradiated samples with SSNTD as material witnesses regarding nuclear radiations) do not appear.

Aufl. 1892). Athenais war die geistvolle Tochter des heidnischen Philosophen Leontius, trat zum Christentum über, wurde als Gemahlin Theodosius’ II. Kaiserin Eudokia (421 – 441 oder 444) und endete, seit 450 Witwe, ihr Leben ca. 460 zu Jerusalem im Exil. Ihre Geschichte interessierte G.

Athenaïs was the spirited daughter of the pagan philosopher Leontius, converted to Christianity, was as the wife of Theodosius II, Empress Eudocia (421 441 or 444) and ended, since 450 widow, lives about 460 to Jerusalem in exile. — — Here another (vague) reference : Jannic Durand et Bernard Flusin, éd., Byzance et les reliques du Christ.

Do you agree ? >… But, until now we have not yet seen an interesting AFM movie on linen fibrils (and their behavior under load) … Unfortunately, after sixteen years (starting from 1998), no serious study (with the use of the controls AFM) appears. Why ? After 16 years no AFM serious study on cellulosic chains and elastic modulus (obtained by indentation or/and 3 P bending test) ! Why ?

If you try to read something surfing the Web, perhaps you find the following words in a question : >”It is difficult to get Young’s modulus with the Nano Scope AFM nanoindenting technique. The modulus depends on the slope of the unloading curve of the indent and the indent force curves generated with this technique are not true sample deformation, but instead the sum of cantilever deflection and sample deformation, which is typically difficult to decouple” Here the answer : >The difficulty was caused by the lack of analysis software, not any problem with the data acquisition (although you will need an accurate deflection sensitivity calibration …) Link : http://nanoscaleworld.bruker axs.com/nanoscaleworld/forums/p/1063/2831.aspx Try also under: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoindentation See : Figure 1.

Both instruments belong to a family of microscopes broadly known as Scanning Probe Microscopes (SPM). The primary use of AFM is to quantitatively determine surface morphology at the nano scale … The sharpness of the tip is the key determinant in the resolution of AFM imaging. In addition to its imaging functions, AFM is also able to quantitatively measure the attractive and repulsive forces that exist between the sample and probe, as the cantilever is brought into contact with and then pulled away from the sample surface. — — — Here an interesting reference (= BIF analyses ! …) : Gibson, C.T., Watson, G.S., Mapledoram, L.D., Kondo, H. & Myhra, S.

Where are the useful inherent evaluations? The color strength of the dyed fabrics can be measured by using a spectrophotometer for D65 illuminant and an observer located at 10º… (Link: http://www.ihara us.com/theory.php?page=4 ) In order to evaluate the wettability of the polyamide woven fabrics, a water drop test can be applied by measuring the time for its complete absorption into the material. If you want to treat the surface of the polyamide samples with plasma (and you have to perform this operation before to do the dyeing process!), then you can see that there is a significant change due to chemical etching, which tends to create oxidized species on the surface of the polyamide fibers. Then the polyamide fiber changes the nature from hydrophobic to hydrophilic which is key point for the adsorption of aqueous dye solutions. But I do not believe this was the phenomenon involved for the Imprint generation, what happened in Jospice Hospital is (probably) another thing… The increase in roughness (for plasma treated samples) can be better understood when AFM images are compared with the polyamide material treated (with “cold dyeing” process) without plasma discharge. We can also proceed toward the Identification of Coloring Compounds. In my opinion there are three main ways to work, thus in order to observe: Chemical structures from spectroscopic analyses Chemical structures of the samples controlled using AFM techniques. Chemical structures of the extracted dye. But this way should be avoided… The morphological and topographical characteristics of the polyamide surface before and after dyeing treatment can be investigated with multimode SPM microscope controls. — — … And, for the moment, I think this should be enough to trigger your response… — — Regards, Piero.","date":"2014-12-19","mins":"10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/18/new-paper-by-pam-moon/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"New Paper by Pam Moon"},{"id":"comment-162602","author":"piero","post":"Sorry Colin, now I take a little ‘space for me and my speeches … I think you could show us something interesting with a simple experiment… I’m going a bit ‘off topic, but I think I will be understood by Colin, the investigator … — — First of all: Thanks to Mario Latendresse we got an explanation about the paper by Fazio and others … Three or four months : there was a good period to work. Now I ask : How is possible to further simplify the question? Here a rough attempt. First of all we have to sketch an analysis in order to define the presumed “Stochastic + deterministic process”. So … We can try to consider two main aspects of the presumed process: 1) random walk of cadaveric emissions = stochastic process or not ? 2) constrained arrival on sheet of cadaveric emission by IR and subsequent chemical attraction by reactive sugars = deterministc process or not ? Is it possible to simplify the problem in this manner in order to study the probabilistic model ? What is the probability level of reaction for cadaveric emissions on linen sheet ? This is a key point. What do you expect to see on linen if the level of cadaveric emissions is low ? — — In any case we need a very simple experiment in order to answer the question : How is the gradient on linen ? In the past, discussing the issue, I indicated a very simple experiment in order to simulate (with a model) the presumed action of cadaveric gases on linen. We have to start with a linen treated with Lead Acetate (White) submitted to H2 S (gas) in order to obtain the Pb S (Black). I have not a Lab at disposal… I think that Colin Berry (a chemical scientist) is able to do that easy work, an experiment that seems to be useful to show the mechanism of a reactive gas on a treated textile. — — At the end I want to remember that we have to examine the problem in a careful manner, step by step. I don’t endorse the cadaveric gas theory, simply I want too see what happens on similsindonic linen. Was Allan Mills able to do that ? I saw what appeared in the book by Knight and Lomas and, frankly, that image is too far from the Shroud! — — Here an example for the IR action on cadaveric emissions (rough simulation): if we are not able to show what happens with a plastic dolly (filled with hot water) coated with an adequate thickness of wet (= sweat + cadaveric amines) skin and covered with linen sheet, then we have to try with another object or another system. I have several doubts about the resolution of inherent images. Probably this problem requires a long work of calibrations… ———————————————————— Mills indicated that : there is no sign of an organic coating on the Shroud. Where is the source for that claim? Where are the inherent analyses? I believe that Mills based its opinion on spectroscopic controls. No direct advanced microscopic controls… (= SPM controls). Mills proposed >the short lived radical “singlet oxygen” as the active species initiating a latent image on the linen thread.

Preliminar remarks about materials used in the research by Lind and Antonacci. I want to tell a textile story about that research. … Reading the small Table on “Relevant Physical Characteristics of Linens used…” we can see what is the difference with respect what is the Shroud. At p. 33 of the book “La Sindone nella sua struttura tessile” (= “Shroud and its own textile structure”) by Piero Vercelli we can read [inherent data are expressed as “number of threads/cm”] : warp weft 38.6 25.7 = Raes 37.6/38 25.8 = Vial 36 24 = Vercelli 37.5 25 = Vercelli Instead in the paper by Lind and Antonacci : 13 15 = German linen 22 18 = French linen 38.6 26 = Shroud Another very interesting fact is connected with the chemical nature of linen threads used. We can read that “French linen ” was a “bleached material”, but we don’t know what was the exact method used during bleaching… For instance, I remember that P. Vercelli indicated me the use of Chlorite during modern bleaching. Probably this treatment can change the level of capillarity of linen fibrils… In any case they had to be more exact working with experiments. Then I suggest to write the exact treatment (= bleaching, in that case) conditions in order to know more on materials used during experiments… At least we have to do a contact angle experiment in order to know something about the behaviour of linen used (= water and blood absorption). In other words : they were incorrect (and I say that only from a textile point of view and not as silly and insulting remark!) in their experiment. Capillarity, warp and weft threads. In the same book (published in Italy by Effatà, in 2010) P. Vercelli wrote something about the observation about the reddish color that was more deep/intense on the points that evidences wefts which (having less torsion than warp) absorbed in a better manner liquids (fluids) that being in the furrow of drawing (and then protected) have been conserved. Vercelli added that publication of scanning for the reverse side of the Shroud confirmed these hypotheses because wefts are evenly stained and coloration appears more evenly than what results on front side. But here I cannot write more, violating copyrights … Sorry. — — If you want to read sometning about “Wet processing engineering”, here the link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet processing engineering = only few lines about the fact that bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities … …and it is certainly not in this way that you can study in depth!

Above TC then the susceptibility varies according to the Curie Weiss law. … Link: http://www.gitam.edu/eresource/Engg Phys/semester 2/magnetic/types.htm.","date":"2016-01-21","mins":"4:31 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/01/21/more-original-cutting-edge-stuff-from-hugh-farey-appears-in-his-latest-bsts-newsletter-no-82-december-2015/","cat":"1532_chambery_fire","title":"More original, cutting edge stuff from Hugh Farey appears in his latest BSTS Newsletter No.82 (December 2015)"},{"id":"comment-144551","author":"piero","post":"It occurred to me that you have not considered Phil Dayvault.

Investigating the linen fibrils (and the cellulosic chains) under the SP Ms we can try to detect the cellulosic DP (as I underlined in Turin in 1998) and then the hope to find the true epoch has an answer. Unfortunately I have not the help about the good SP Ms investigations (= AFM, CFM, SNOM). But I hope to see the truth in the future. — 2) the Biological traces. In Italy the case of the remains of the famous painter Caravaggio (= DNA) was solved. But the death of Michelangelo Merisi happened in 1610. In the case of the Shroud the Ancient DNA seems to be more difficult to detect and control (and see also : the level of degradation about the DNA and the past claims by Garza Valdes). — — — Frankly I am not able to solve the other too difficult questions about the BIF (= Body Image Formation). See for example the three faces of the BIF : 1) Was the Corpse of Jesus vanished through the nanoholes ? Was the Shroud a result of the emission of the Vacuum Energy ? See also : the claims by Eng. G. Fanti and Dr. P. Di Lazzaro about the excimer lasers and the VUV. 2) Was the Image obtained applying the Ark of the Covenant (a great mystery of the Bible as energy source) to the Corpse ? See the idea of the Corona Discharge by Scheuermann, Fanti (who believe in the internal origin = from the corpse and not from an external field) and others.

ABSTRACT Positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) is a novel method that provides molecular level information about complex macromolecular structure in a manner different from, but complementary to, conventional physical and chemical methodology. This paper presents a perspective of PAS in polymeric systems covering 12 aspects: historical, spacial, spherical quantum model, anisotropic structure, voids, positronium chemistry, time, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and data analysis, variable monoenergetic slow positron beam techniques and depth profiling, elemental analysis, multidimensional instrumentation advances in PAS, and free volume and free volume theories.

Amen (and then: see also the lack of exact informations about the Raman analyses of the year 2002!!!). — — — I had simply seen there was a strange debate that was not able to solve the problem, then I indicated the AFM techniques as useful tools to try to solve the problem. Unfortunately, I see that you can not even follow me (or try to debate in a more decent manner, ie: not having to use the silly cartoons that do not reflect the truth) in my old idea of trying to identify a possible era [who can identify the age of the textile material] using chemical and physical analyses. Instead you invoke the result of a C14 1988 dating which has been questioned by many … By the way: we have never had the raw data obtained in 1988 !!! After this fact we have seen that has been developed by some “seekers of truth” the interesting conjecture about the likely “gradient of time” (see, for example, what has been written by researchers fiercely anchored in search of a possible satisfactory explanation about that “quiz”, even in the absence of special exact data [ie raw data that we lack] these researchers are: Ballabio, Fanti and others …), etc. Apart the presence of cotton, etc. In my opinion there is not yet a true proof (= an incontrovertible result) about a “corner of darning” as the solution of “the strange 14 C result”. We still have to work (to work hard with nondestructive analyses) a lot in order to show the truth.

In this study, the potential relationships between the microstructure and the surface properties of different cotton fibers are analyzed. This method is based on the analysis of adsorption of gaseous probes on solid surfaces. By measuring the retention time of probes into a column containing the fibers, thermodynamic surface characteristics of these fibers, in particular the dispersive component of their surface energy, and their surface morphological aspects, are determined.

I thought wrong, in a moment of memory loss … I didn’t remembered and the I merged two different kind of products: graphite and carbon fibres in one …that doesn’t exist… In any case graphite is the final stage of the carbonization process. Graphite may be considered the highest grade of coal, just above anthracite and alternatively called meta anthracite, although it is not normally used as fuel because it is difficult to ignite. Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite Instead there are three different organic precursor materials used to produce carbon fibers : rayon, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and pitch… I continue to be skeptic about the “quality of black charcoal”. You claim there are ordered layers (= microcristalline graphite) after “deep schorching of linen”. Here instead I doubt that linen fibrils can turn into ordered graphitic structures (= network solid) because I remember that carbon fibres, etc. Were mainly obtained from acrylic materials (= PAN), etc. … Natural linens are not a pure chemical material like acrylic fibers and contain different quantities of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignins. Who is right? Perhaps the truth can be shown only controlling the results obtained from adequate experiments on linen fibrils (building an interesting “degradation scale” and testing inherent materials under SEM and AFM). For example: we can try to control what was previously done by Dr. Mario Cappi (Turin, 1998) and others. Is that useless? It depends on what was the nature of linen samples (= natural linen without bleaching products or not, etc.). — — — Here a bitter note regarding your interesting furfural polymers: yesterday I was not lucky in my search with Google… and today I have to cut wood (to burn) for myself… — — Using SPM controls we can detect interesting signature of aging. See also: – Morphology – Polymer decomposition by slow oxidation – Cellulosic degree of depolimerization. Eng. Fanti and Dr. Malfi were able to do tensile measurements for monitoring of mechanical properties. Young’s modulus was obtained by destructive mechanical testing method. But we should avoid to destroy linen samples (coming from the Shroud) and also we have to distinguish 1532 fire damage and heating effects with respect signature of aging (and that can be obtained choosing adequate areas with a preliminar mapping). … Another question : apparently there are no experiments or works on dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) for determining the modulus over a wide temperature range. That problem can be solved using (for inherent tests) materials utilised during the building of the “scale of degradation”… — — — Here three lines for Mario: I don’t believe in strange nuclear irradiations of linen fibrils (taking apart natural radiation background !). But… How to exactly measure crosslinking and scission effects due to (presumed) radiation damage, without AFM techniques? Perhaps we can add some control on material coming from exposure to excilamps… I hope that you will want to forgive me for this idea of control that is quite particular … — — — — Excilamps are the sources of incoherent UV and VUV radiation based on the non equilibrium radiation of exciplex or excimer molecules. Here another more detailed explanation: >Excilamps are a kind of gas discharge lamps radiating in UV or VUV spectral region due to the decomposition of excimer molecules (excited dimer – excimer, in the case of a molecule consisting of equal atoms, Ar2* for example) or exciplex molecules (excited complex – exciplex, in the case of a hetero nuclear molecule, Xe Cl* for example).

That material was very far from the modern values for their strength and modulus of elasticity (near 300 M Pa and 600 G Pa, respectively)… Max Fremery and Johann Urban developed a method to produce carbon fibers for use in light bulbs in 1897. But, if I am right, modern production of carbon fibres started in 1959 at the Union Carbide Company. In any case I have also read that: >English chemist/physicist Joseph Swan experimented with a carbon filament incandescent light all the way back in 1860, and by 1878 had developed a better design which he patented in Britain. >On the other side of the Atlantic, Thomas Edison developed a successful carbon filament bulb, receiving a patent for it (#223898) in January 1880, before Lewis Latimer did any work in electric lighting… … And at Innventia, research activities have shown that it is possible to produce carbon fibres from lignin, which is a by product in a kraft pulp mill. The lignin is extracted from black liquor using a patented biorefinery concept called Ligno Boost. With this process we can obtain a lignin that is so pure that it can be used for manufacturing carbon fibre.

Although the particular questions connected with Textile Chemistry are not yet well explained (*) in your paper, however I agree with you about the importance of the studies by Rogers. *) See f.e. : – Rogers indicated the question of “erythrostarch” (= starch that turns red). – Pectin is a substance composed by pectic acid, that is (mainly) galacturonic acid, partly or completely esterified with methyl alcohol – etc. — — STARCH. The presumed fact that “no references to the use of starch in antiquity have been found” (paper by Fanti, Heimburger and others) seems to be a bit strange and incredible … Mc Crone actually observed wheat starch granules. Yes, he was able to work and, in that case, I believe him. He studied starch granules, and he reported the inherent properties in his Particle Atlas. (B.T.W.: Do you know these granules ?) In any case my name is not connected with Fanti, Botella, Di Lazzaro, Heimburger and Svensson. Yes, the study “Microscopic and Macroscopic Characteristics of the Shroud of Turin Image Superficiality” was an interesting attempt, but that work was not careful (speaking from the point of view of Textile Chemistry and Applied Microscopy …). So, I remained aloof from that “inconsistent work” (Sorry… Here no offence or personal affront !) claiming something without the required proofs (because they don’t used the advanced Microscopies = AFM, CFM …). Have you read the book : “Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood” (2001) by Oliver Sacks ? It is an autobiographical account of his early life in a family where curiosity and inquisitiveness were encouraged. Reading a page of this book we found the interesting comment about the discovery of the vision for the true atoms with the (Tungsten) tip of an Atomic Force Microscopy. Well… Why I have cited Oliver Sacks ? In 1998 I wrote about AFM (as a method to control the truth about the samples from the Shroud, see also : the 14 C tests of 1988) without the support of true controls, a forewarning with a vague image from the University of Pisa. Instead Ray Rogers indicated another kind of approach : ESCA (= Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis), in the paper “An Alternate Hypothesis for the Image Color”. But he pretty convincingly established the fact of a thin layer of starch impurities on the surface of the fibers. So… We have to show that presence (of starch) using the modern tools and that (perhaps) was not well appreciated by Fanti & other researchers. Theses guys (with all due respect to their academic qualifications) pointed the finger mainly toward the primary cell wall… Perhaps they are not familiar with the different properties of the different fractions of starch. So… What is your opinion ? When tested with iodine, normal soluble starch turns blue. Starch that is soluble only in hot water turns red. Do you agree on that information ? For example: I have read that erythrodextrin can be distinguished from other carbohydrates by its red color reaction with iodine. And I have found another information: >Starch is converted to erythro dextrin and dextrose by boiling with dilute mineral acids. If the boiling is prolonged the erythro dextrin is converted to dextrose… Source: http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook text/Exercises in Practical Physiological Chemistry 1000245717/45 [Exercises in Practical Physiological Chemistry by Sydney William Cole, 1927] There are three kinds of dextrins : amylo , erythro and achro ; the amylo and erythro dextrins giving a red or brownish colour with iodine solution, the achro dextrin being unaffected by this reagent. From Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextrin ) we know that : >Dextrins are a group of low molecular weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch … In any case Rogers indicated us that higher molecular weight, hot water soluble starch is the last to wash out of a cloth and the reaction with iodine produces a red color… Where are the colored photomicrograph of red fibers ? Have you seen the interesting images ? Have you found the useful chemical proofs? Are you able to send us inherent pictures ? In your study there are no images… Why ? I believe that Colin Berry is able to show us the red fibers… Am I wrong in my idea ? How to estimate the exact composition of thin layers on linen fibrils ? Is it possible to control the famous “ghosts” using non destructive analyses ? — — Now I want to speak about my doubts about the quantity (and distribution) of cadaveric gases involved into the scenario proposed by Arnoldi and Rogers … IMO Rogers was an able thermochemist but (although he claimed the Maillard reaction as solution for the problem) he was not able to solve the Enigma with a incontrovertible and credible experiment (B.T.W. : DETA is not a natural amine !). — — Yesterday I have read the acronym DC STE (DC= Direct Contact, STE = Sorptive Tape Extraction ). If you try with Google using that acronym probably you will find few or nothing… But there is a method based on direct contact sorptive tape extraction followed by on line thermal desorption gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (DC STE–GC–MS) to detect and quantify a group of suspected volatile allergens … So, the exact acronym is not DC STE, but DC STE–GC–MS… Where are the useful works? I have read something, but they were far from the resolution of the Shroud … — — — Putrescine and Cadaverine. Related compounds that are both produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms. The two compounds are largely responsible for the foul odor of putrefying flesh.

Here two points from where […] I started for my previous message : 1) the word “erythrostarch” was indicated by Dr. Ray Rogers in a private communication (it’s the high molecular weight compound and I had some doubts about that erythrostarch)… I was acquainted with a story about erythrostarch as a fraction of crude starch that has a range of molecular weights such that iodine causes it to give a red color… 2) erythrodextrins solutions (substances with low molecular weight), that clearly turned red with iodine .. So … What is erythrostarch ? Where is the truth ? B.T.W. : Now I am inclined toward the second choice… (erythrodextrins generated from starch hydrolization) …and you ? In any case I remember that (ten years ago : in 2004 !) I tried to indicate a possible way to solve the problem of “erythrostarch” pointing the finger toward a study : “Fingerprinting polysaccharides with single molecule atomic force microscopy” by Marszalek, Hongbin and Fernandez (in my opinion that rough approach [to develop with adequate experiments] seemed to be useful).

I believe you have to show us the results obtained from the controls on painted linens (…with ageing treatement and not). Here some example: 1 – “Progress in the application of ATR FTIR microscopy to the study of multi layered cross sections from works of art” by Adriana Rizzo Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry September 2008, Volume 392, Issue 1 2, pp 47 55 Date: 18 Apr 2008 Abstract >As a non invasive or micro invasive technique attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (ATR FTIR) microscopy is a valuable tool for the analysis of materials in works of art. An application for which it has received growing interest is in the analysis of paint cross sections. However, FTIR microscope configurations, objectives’ geometries and low spatial resolutions, and issues of sample preparation have often hampered the characterization of individual layers or features in cross sections. With the use of case studies, it is demonstrated here that an ATR FTIR microscope featuring a crystal of optimized geometry and a viewing capability feature allows characterization of individual layers, or areas within layers, of 10 μm thickness or less in single measurements. Of particular value is a remote aperturing feature which allows the analysis of selected areas within the contact footprint of the ATR crystal. Since the technique is non destructive, the same area can be analyzed by complementary microscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy. Pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry was also used in some cases to corroborate the spectroscopic data. The analyses presented provided data which were important in informing art historical interpretation and conservation of the artworks examined Link: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2 Fs00216 008 2064 2# 2 ATR FTIR imaging for the analysis of organic materials in paint cross sections: case studies on paint samples from the National Gallery, London Marika Spring, Camilla Ricci, David A.

Here I want to turn for a moment in a boring guy… because I have seen that ATR FTR analyses don’t seem to affect much. Then … there is a famous example about the “scientific prevision” that can be useful to remember… Reminder: The data for light deflection observed during the eclipse (of the Sun) of 1919 were coming from two groups of measurements: one at Sobral (Brasil) and the other in the Prince’s Island. The first case furnished the following value = 1”, 98 + 0”,30 and the second indicated 1”,61+0”,30. But in 1923 William Wallace Campbell and Robert Julius Trurmper , published an article where the prevision of General Relativity (by Einstein) about stellar light deflection due to the mass of Sun were compared with a group of measurements taken during a total eclipse of Sun that happened in September 21, 1922. The theretical value foreseen by General Relativity was 1″,745, instead the experimental mean value found was equal to 1″,72 +/ 0″,11. Then the comparison turned to be a strong confirmation for the theorical value. Here few other lines (History of Science): early calculations done by E Instein in 1911 indicated a deflection value of 0″,87 (in 1911, Einstein wrote: “A ray of light going past the Sun would accordingly undergo deflexion to an amount of 4×10 6 = 0.83 seconds of arc.”), then a value near identical of that indicated in 1801 by Johann Georg von Soldner (1776 1833), a scientist who remained in the field of the Newton’s theory and also hypothesized that light was an heavy body subject to the diffusion from the solar mass. But in 1915 the newtonian idea was replaced by arguments based on space’s curvature and the estimation flowed into a value twice (= 1″,74) with respect the previous data. Unfortunately in 1914 and in 1916 there was the war period and in 1918 an attempt achieved by american researchers did not produced a sufficient amount of data … That is: at the end we must remember the famous phrase… “Carthago delenda est” !… Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests of general relativity Please, read the similar words under the paragraph: “Deflection of light by the Sun”: >… The first observation of light deflection was performed by noting the change in position of stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere. The observations were performed in May 1919 by Arthur Eddington and his collaborators during a total solar eclipse,[12] so that the stars near the Sun could be observed. Observations were made simultaneously in the cities of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil and in São Tomé and Príncipe on the west coast of Africa.[13] The result was considered spectacular news and made the front page of most major newspapers. It made Einstein and his theory of general relativity world famous. When asked by his assistant what his reaction would have been if general relativity had not been confirmed by Eddington and Dyson in 1919, Einstein famously made the quip: “Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway.”. … … and then now my hands are almost burning for impatience! But I have found another link: http://www.newtonphysics.on.ca/eclipse/index.html Where we can read the following words: >In “Weird but True” Jamal Munshi reports: “Dr. F. Schmeidler of the Munich University Observatory has published a paper titled “The Einstein Shift An Unsettled Problem,” and a plot of shifts for 92 stars for the 1922 eclipse shows shifts going in all directions, many of them going the wrong way by as large a deflection as those shifted in the predicted direction! Further examination of the 1919 and 1922 data originally interpreted as confirming relativity, tended to favor a larger shift, the results depended very strongly on the manner for reducing the measurements and the effect of omitting individual stars. >So now we find that the legend of Albert Einstein as the world’s greatest scientist was based on the Mathematical Magic of Trimming and Cooking of the eclipse data to present the illusion that Einstein’s general relativity theory was correct in order to prevent Cambridge University from being disgraced because one of its distinguished members [Eddington] was close to being declared a “conscientious objector”. … … So we should conclude that a certain amount of tricks seems to be necessary to work with succeed in the field of Science… and the claim of that webpage is that they (= P. Marmet and C. Couture, Physics Department, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada) have shown “that no one can seriously claim that light is really deflected by the Sun.” !!! Really ??? and I have found another webpage, by V.N. Strel’tsov [Dubna, Russia] ( Link: http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/articles/3 5/Strel light.htm ), that reinforce these strange claims … Here the last words : >… a gravitational field does not influence on a light ray.

So using the AFM techniques we can also better identify the composition of colored thin layers. As regards the famous problem of the lack of depth (= z direction) with AFM analyses, I think this fact can be overcome using samples cut almost at the nanometer level… As you already know, Dr. Ray Rogers did underline this “z direction” problem [several years ago] in a message (addressed to myself). I was not quite prepared for that problem because, more than anything else, I had thought the general way of accurate measurement of the cellulose chains.

In any case cell walls are composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and pectin. So, firstly, we can try to hypothesize that Ar F VUV laser (= yellowish coloration) acts mainly on PCW and, after, we have to test this hypothesis (and then we can work with controls based on AFM techniques). Am I wrong in my idea? The Ar F laser (λ = 0.193 μm, 0.08 J per pulse, 12 ns) emits radiation in the VUV spectral region with smaller energy and shorter pulse duration than Xe Cl lasers. Observe the Figure n. 7 of the paper by DI Lazzaro, Murra and Santoni (link: http://www.frascati.enea.it/fis/lac/excimer/sindone/2012 16 ENEA.pdf). = “Microscope image of a single linen fiber colored after Ar F laser irradiation.” “The mechanical damage in the central part shows small pieces of colored primary cell wall on a colorless inner part of the fiber” (the average diameter of the fiber is 20 μm). Instead the Figure 9a shows a linen fabric after Ar F laser irradiation when it is illuminated with a UV lamp. >The area irradiated by the laser emits a much smaller blue fluorescence with respect to the linen fabric … If linen samples treated with Xe Cl laser (= brownish color) cannot be investigated in a careful manner with AFM techniques, then we should apply an “ultramicrotomy treatment” to the samples in order to know something of useful. But this kind of treatment (a destructive manipulation) seems to me a little bad choice… Regarding the thermal changes the authors stated that: >the linen region irradiated by the UV Xe Cl laser was heated up to 33 °C, while the linen irradiated by the VUV Ar F laser up to 25 °C. We can also try to consider – Figure 13a. Left: photo of the linen during Xe Cl laser irradiation. – Figure 13b. Left: photo of the linen during Ar F laser irradiation. And their text indicated also the same picture seen in infrared light. But I have some doubt regarding the exact temperature on lignin areas into the linen fibrils… Here what Cardamone underlined about Lignin: >…it exhibits plasticity and viscous flow. >As a thermoplastic resin, lignin congeals upon cooling, leaving hard, globular, dark deposits. We have not at disposal microscopical images (taken at high magnification) in order to verify the morphology in order to identify the possible presence of “hard, globular, dark deposits” (indicated by Cardamone).

This technique was successfully employed to determine the hydrated thickness of a series of crosslinked tetraglyme coatings on ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene substrates intended to reduce wear of acetabular cups in total hip replacements. The hydrated coatings ranged from 30 to 200 nm thick and were accurately measured despite the relatively high root mean square (RMS) roughness of the substrates, 20 35 nm (peak to peak roughness 55 100 nm).

But there are several other unsolved questions. How to solve the problems ? You cannot work only on old basis (the findings of the STRP, etc.). We have to discover something about the linen fibrils (= the probable original epoch) and the thin layers on linen fibrils (= the probable BIF). How to discover the useful data ? In 1998 (in Turin) my answer was : using the new way : the SPM (= Scanning Probe Microscopy). After 14 years I have seen very few works (near nothing) that followed this way. You underlined that your background/curriculum is not in the scientific field, so (probably) it is useless to discuss in a deep manner the issues … For example : You wrote that Raman analyses are very important, but you don’t explained us the reasons for that importance. — — You suggest that I have to contact the Prof. Fanti, who should be able to give some guidelines. But you forget that Fanti, in 1998, indicated the NMR (and not the Raman analyses). So I was the first to suggest the SPM (in the same year 1998) and the next work by Fanti (probably) will be in that field. I add : the Raman analyses (used also in Forensic Science) cannot explain all the things. It will be useful to work also with other systems. In the past I required to Prof. Fanti some linen samples (adequately treated with the Corona Discharge) to submit to the AFM controls (in order to show the comparisons with the other treatments), but he refused because (first of all) he wanted to read the Plan or the Project prior to send the samples … But I am not a worker of a public or private corporation and I have not the adequate supports or a great amount of money to spend.

However, that changed on September 9, 1915, when the famous scientist Nikola Tesla published an article entitled The Wonder World to be Created by Electricity. In it, he made the following astounding claim: …Moses was undoubtedly a practical and skillful electrician far in advance of his time. The Bible describes precisely and minutely arrangements constituting a machine in which electricity was generated by friction of air against silk curtains and stored in a box constructed like a condenser. It is very plausible to assume that the sons of Aaron were killed by a high tension discharge… The term condenser is an older word for what we now know as a capacitor, or an electrical machine capable of storing energy. Tesla thought that the Ark generated static electricity by causing air to rub against curtains. This created static electricity which was then stored inside the Ark, turning the box into a giant Leyden Jar. Source: http://www.guerrillaexplorer.com/strange science/ark of the covenant lost technology/ 2) >… after his escape from Egypt, Moses ordered the construction of the Ark of the Covenant to house the tablets of stone on which were written the original “Ten Commandments”. Its construction is described in great detail in the book of Exodus and according to the Bible and Jewish legend it was endowed with miraculous powers including emitting sparks and fire and striking dead Aaron’s sons and others who touched it. It was basically a wooden box of acacia wood lined with gold and also overlaid on the outside with gold. The lid was decorated with two “cherubim” with outstretched wings. In 1915 Nikola Tesla, in an essay entitled “The Fairy Tale of Electricity” promoting the appreciation of electrical developments, proposed what seemed a plausible explanation for some of the magical powers of the Ark. He claimed that the gold sheaths separated by the dry acacia wood effectively formed a large capacitor on which a static electrical charge could be built up by friction from the curtains around the Ark and this accounted for the sparks and the electrocution of Aaron’s sons. >Recent calculations have shown however that the capacitance of the box would be in the order of 200 pico farads and such a capacitor would need to be charged to 100,000 volts to store even 1 joule of electrical energy, not nearly enough to cause electrocution. It seems Tesla’s explanation was appropriately named. Source: http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm So… Was the Ark of the Covenant a mysterious biblical piece of ancient technology ?

Link: http://www.cambridge.org/co/academic/subjects/archaeology/archaeological theory and methods/archaeological theory who sets agenda It’s an old book published in July 1993… and this volume consists of 11 papers, plus introduction, which directly and indirectly critically review and discuss the theoretical debates centred around the development of post processual archaeology. The authors come from a variety of positions on post processual theory, ranging from the guardedly supportive, the ambivalent, the constructively critical, to the hostile. Many of the papers were written for a session in the 1988 Theoretical Archaeological Group (TAG) conference at Sheffield University, England. … >The subtitle of this book immediately raises the issues of power and politics in archaeology: how are archaeological agendas set and by whom? >What are the hegemonic processes and structures that ensure certain discourses are privileged? >Given the criticisms that have been levelled at archaeology for more than a decade by indigenous people, feminists, and the post processualists themselves, such issues are fundamental in current theoretical debate. >Unfortunately the politics of archaeological theory building is hardly discussed, and little sense of any analysis of who sets and defines the debates emerges from the volume. In part, this is due to the nature of theoretical debate in archaeology. … Link: http://www.australianarchaeologicalassociation.com.au/journal/review of archaeological theory who sets the agenda edited by norman yoffee and andrew sherratt/ At the end of my long message there are the following questions to answer: What kind of relationship do you think exists between your own various attempts, the careful archaeological analysis of the Shroud and the various kinds of cultural conditioning which influence the honest research? What are the exact archaeological implications deriving from your hypotheses? — — — In any case it seems to me really a strange coincidence that a technology (= your interesting “flour imprint technology”…) that enabled to create the Shroud (see also the use of the presumed “wooden framework”) has never been used another time … Then this is a suspicious uniqueness.

In IGC, a column filled with the solid sample to be investigated and a single gas (probe molecule) is injected. The aim of this characterisation technique is to determine the thermodynamic surface properties and surface morphological aspect of linen or/and cotton fibres. The surface characterisation by Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC) has been recommended by several papers. I have read that IGC method is the better method to determine the energetic properties of fibers than wetting technique … When you want to properly speak about the surface of that Ancient Linen, then you can try to do something using IGC, because testing the hypothesis of “natural production by stochastic process” you require (at least) some basic data … The basic tools for IGC are inexpensive, widely available and well suited for routine laboratory applications. Then the application of inverse gas chromatography seems to be easy, cheap and quick! Physiochemical data. You can consider dispersive component of surface energy and specific free energy in different experimental conditions. In 1936 Joel H. Hildebrand (who laid the foundation for solubility theory in his classic work on the solubility of nonelectrolytes in 1916) proposed the square root of the cohesive energy density as a numerical value indicating the solvency behavior of a specific solvent. Link: http://cool.conservation us.org/byauth/burke/solpar/solpar2.html Then Hildebrand solubility parameter for a pure liquid substance is defined as the square root of the cohesive energy density. Here I presume you know the heat of vaporization, V(index m) = the molar volume, RT (from the Ideal Gas law [Liter atm / mole K] * K = [L atm / mol] ) and the energy of vaporization…. The partial pressures of all of the components in a mixture of real gases depend on the types of molecules and the temperature. At constant temperature, the internal energy of a mixture remains constant; however, the partial pressures of the components depend on their “fugacity.” In any case we can expect that the chemical researchers are able to work using the IGC … Unfortunately Rogers passed away in 2005. I can recommand you to read a polish paper (in english) published in 2008: “Inverse gas chromatography as a source of physiochemical data” (read, at the end of this message, the bibliographic reference) because IGC could be called a milestone in testing properties of liquid and solid materials. Typical units are hildebrand : 1 hildebrand = (1 cal )^1/2 (1 cm)^ 3/2 = 0.48888 (Mega Pascal)^1/2 The conventional units for the solubility parameter are (calories per cm3)^1/2, or: (cal)^1/2 (cm)^−3/2. Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildebrand solubility parameter See also : Hildebrand’s delta. Hildebrand solubility parameter is also known as three dimensional solubility parameters or HSP because Hansen proposed an extension of the Hildebrand parameter in order to estimate relative miscibility of polar and hydrogen bonding systems. There is a formula to calculate the distance (Ra) between Hansen parameters in Hansen space. Combining this with the interaction radius gives the relative energy difference (RED) of the system (the ratio Ra/R0, where R0 is a value called interaction radius that is given to the substance being dissolved). Historically Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) have been used in industries such as paints and coatings where understanding and controlling solvent/polymer interactions was vital. Over the years their use has been extended widely… Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansen solubility parameter For molecules whose heats of vaporization can be measured (… or calculated) one can determine the value of delta. There are three delta components (Hansen evaluation system): – dispersion – electrostatic – hydrogen bonding Do you know HSP (= Hansen Solubility Parameters) for myrrhoaloetic oils ? Perhaps you can try to do some easily experiments using methane or propane gas in your cooling room (both are explosive gases when mixed with air: warning, take care!!!). — — I have read that: the retention volume is calculated from the retention time and the partial pressure from the peak/step height. Since the retention volume represents the first derivation of the adsorbed amount, integration gives the isotherm.

An oily, viscous substance, indicated by Norma Weller (now a deceased researcher), who also wrote something about an archaeological expert in ancient forms of burial and embalming… IGC can be employed to explore changes in surface energy (see, for example : Corona Discharge treatments, etc. …) IGC became very popular method for the measurement of physico chemical properties of solid materials. Therefore Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC), at infinite dilution, can be used to determine thermodynamic parameters of adsorption, such as free energy, enthalpy and entropy, as well as the dispersion component of surface free energy, and the interaction parameter. Then Inverse Gas Chromatography can be an useful tool to use in the case of experiments about thymol treatments (see: the inherent old claims)… I am curious to see what happens with natural linen samples, natural treated linen and modern/commercial linen samples. Perhaps they should show a smaller surface energy due to the additional treating ingredients and processing methods… In any case, I hope in your interesting answers… —————————— Bibliographic references : – D.R.

I think that our Physics has some way to go before to speak about certain ideas of dimensional change with simultaneous transport in other dimensions… I hope that the required improvement of useful physical knowledges will be obtained with the same speed of that which come from the progress deriving from the use of an instrument: Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). In other words, see the study: “Comment on AMS02 results support the secondary origin of cosmic ray positrons” by Roberto A. Lineros April 14, 2015 arxiv:1504.03261 under the address: https://www.dmhunters.org/?p=12252 >Recently Blum, Katz and Waxman have claimed that the flux of high energy cosmic ray (CR) positrons near Earth that has been measured with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) aboard the International Space Station can be produced in the collisions of Galactic CR protons and nuclei with the ambient matter in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM).Their claim was based on an alleged “robust upper limit to the positron flux” which neglected the energy loss of e+’s in the ISM. Inclusion of this energy loss, however, yields a much smaller upper limit, which excludes secondary production in the ISM by the Galactic cosmic rays as the main origin of the CR e^+ flux above 10 Ge V. — — — The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS 02) is a state of the art particle physics detector designed to operate as an external module on the International Space Station. It will use the unique environment of space to study the universe and its origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter while performing precision measurements of cosmic rays composition and flux. The AMS 02 observations will help answer fundamental questions, such as “What makes up the universe’s invisible mass?” or “What happened to the primordial antimatter?” — — Then AMS and AFM are the two different ways to know this World… B.T.W., here what I have found in a new health field: >Nanodentistry is an emerging field with significant potential to yield new generation of technologically advanced clinical tools and devices for oral healthcare. Nanoscale topology and quantitative biomechanical or biophysical analysis of dental surfaces are of significant interest. In particular, using Atomic force microscopy techniques—diseases such as dental caries, tooth hypersensitivity, and oral cancer can be quantified based on morphological, biophysical and biochemical nanoscale properties of tooth surface itself and dental materials or oral fluids such as saliva. An outlook on future “nanodentistry” developments such as saliva exosomes based diagnostics, designing biocompatible, antimicrobial dental implants and personalized dental healthcare is presented… Don’t you want to think to improve the health?

For example: Our Lord Jesus Christ had a foster father: St. Joseph. However: where is the tomb of St. Joseph? Recently I read a short service on the ancient cult of St. Joseph in Palestine. Along with the article was a picture of the so called Tomb of the Right or of St. Joseph (which exists at the convent of the Sisters of Nazareth), the text was also quoted an ancient document called Judeo Christian “Historia Josepi”. According to this ancient report the death and glorification of St. Joseph took place right in the place where according to tradition Jesus revealed his “secret doctrine”, ie on Mount Olivet … The Dominican Milan Isidoro Isolano inserted the History of St. Joseph in his “Summa de donis St. Joseph”, printed in Pavia, in 1522. And in that work the story of Joseph’s life is attributed to Jesus himself, who would confided to the disciples on the Mount of Olives. Isidoro Isolano, who wrote the Summa of the gifts of St. Joseph, said that there will come a time when you will discover riches enclosed in St. Joseph. The Gospel of St. Matthew informs us that the death of Christ, “the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints who had died, resurrected. Coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many “… So: St. Joseph was among them? Another question: the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother of Jesus, is seen by some as the dying and then resurrected and went to heaven. Others (here I refer to one of the many responses given by Our Lady in Medjugorje) seem to deny that Mary is dead! Then: the Blessed Virgin Mary was dead or simply “asleep”? Some theologians, although the precise address expressed years ago by Pope Wojtyla, seems still debating the issue … — — — After these notes, however, I would not be passed to a heretic … St. Joseph by the unanimous opinion of the theologians and the teaching of Blessed Pius IX (Decree Quemadmodum Deus, December 8, 1870), Leo XIII (enciclica Quamquam pluries, August 15, 1889) and Pius XI (speech of 21 April 1926) exceeds dignity in any other saint of the Old and New Testament Baptist (though John the Baptist died a martyr, shedding his blood, and therefore there is no comparison) and Apostles included. Make faith the true marriage of St. Joseph with the Blessed Virgin Mary, the high paternity exercised against Jesus Christ, the extraordinary mission leader and guardian of the Holy Family, unsurpassed participation and knowledge of the divine plan of salvation I don’t put myself against the Truth of the Faith, but I see that some mysteries still seem to remain unresolved. Should we add mystery to the Mysteries? I do not think this is the right way to go toward the Truth. — — — Bibliography: Summa de donis sancti Joseph. – “Titre” : En, lector ingenue, novum opus… Summa, in quatuor secta partes, de donis sancti Joseph, sponsi beatissimae Virginis Mariae ac patris putativi Christi Jesu… [aedita a fratre Isidoro de Isolanis.] – “Au fol. 101” : Papiaeque impressa, apud Jacob Paucidrapium, M.D.XXII., tertio cal.

Although these speculations are a bit strange in the eyes of the profane (see, for example, the harsh criticism of the “sins” made by “Shroudology” that is present in the now famous book Nicolotti, published in Italy by Einaudi), I think that might be interesting. To improve the calculations we should also keep in mind the speed of reaction to the light (of the excimer laser) of the material present at the surface characteristics of the fibrils. That is, we can not say that the chemical reaction is instantaneous because it requires a certain amount of time (little, IMO. In any case there is a proportionality with respect the power. And then see the exact energy threshold to overcome…). The same Dr.Paolo Di Lazzaro has highlighted the question of the latent image (ie: the imprint, produced with a certain wavelength, may develop after a certain period of exposure to air …), so that the B.I.F. Problem seems to be even more complex. So you have to identify the points on which to pin power.

Where are the high resolution images ? Where are the AFM controls on these crystals ? How is possible that aragonite crystals are adherent on linen (and visible at naked eye) after 2000 years ? What are the result of experiments on adhesion (included AFM experiments) ? What was the exact amount of visible crystals before the vacuuming operation ? What was the exact amount of visible crystals after the ostensions ? Where are the inherent proofs ? There is another question that we have already considered. The hypothesis of Ca O turned in Ca Co3 and then one can affirm that a slow precipitate of carbonate, at low temperature (evaporation) around an organic fibre (cellulose) in presence of salt (sweat) must take the orthorhombic form (aragonite).

The pathway to consider is the following: Ca O —> Ca(OH)2 —> Ca CO3 —> Ca CO3 precipitate —> aragonite Sorry. The previous scheme is a bit rough… Is it true that aragonite was only found on the sole of the feet and perhaps on nose and knees, but it was not detected elsewhere? My opinion about the right answer was the following : the useful answer cannot be reached using microanalysis with electronic microprobe (EMP) or microanalysis with laser ablation microprobe (LAM ICP MS) [= micro destructive control]… Instead I believed in AFM and AFM Raman controls, because laser ablation microprobe (LAM ICP MS) is destructive and AFM not… — — — I have read that : >Isotopic compositions of geological material are a kind of ‘DNA’ that has been widely used in geochemistry to identify various sources of rocks and processes that have shaped our Earth. … >During the past few decades, in situ LA (MC) ICP MS techniques have developed rapidly, and have been widely applied in geochemistry, including measurements of trace elements … But I don’t believe in that way.

The mineralogy of the Site 1256 carbonate veins is therefore determined from their Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios, which reveal two distinct groups (Fig. F1; Table T1). The compact calcite structure can incorporate the small Mg cation, whereas aragonite has a larger cation site and favors accommodation of the larger Sr cation (Deer et al., 1992). Samples with Sr/Ca ratios less than ~0.2 mmol/mol are classified as calcite, and those with Mg/Ca ratios of less than ~2.5 mmol/mol are classified as aragonite (Table T1; Fig. F1). The remaining samples, with intermediate compositions (Sr/Ca >0.2 mmol/mol and Mg/Ca >2.5 mmol/mol), are interpreted to be aragonite calcite mixtures, which were homogenized during hand picking. >Fe and Mn are similar in diameter to Mg and are therefore also preferentially incorporated into calcite, with Fe/Ca ranging from ~3 to ~35 mmol/mol and Mn/Ca ratios up to ~80 mmol/mol (Fig. F1). The aragonite veins have lower Fe/Ca ratios (The carbonate veins have 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios ranging from ~0.70804 to 0.70872. The majority of the aragonite veins have Sr isotopic compositions between ~0.7087 and ~0.7086, whereas the calcite veins precipitated from fluids with 87 Sr/86 Sr ranging from ~0.7086 to ~0.7080. The strontium isotopic composition of the oceans ~15 m.y. Ago was ~0.70875 (Hodell et al., 1991), and it has increased progressively since then. All the carbonate veins precipitated from fluids with 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios lower than the seawater 87 Sr/86 Sr ratio has been since the eruption of the host basalt.

I try to limit the amount of confusions in topic that we have covered before … Yesterday I have pointed the finger toward the cold pad batch dyeing process because this is the simplest model to use during our tough will (as truth seekers) of exact investigations in the laboratory for researching body transfer phenomena… For example : first of all we can try to do something of useful working with our feet on polyamidic soles or polyamide polyurethane covered soles … (But we are still free men and we are not working in a sort of laogai… So, we must try to do other works!). Louis, you wrote: >Part of the head can be seen on the imprint ?????? So, I turned a bit confused and I wrote “to chose” instead of “to choose” … Not, on that Mattress Imprint there is no head or “part of the head”. Instead there are the imprints of : – the shoulders – the beginning of a leg – an arm – an hand. The hand show a good resolution, the same for the buttocks, but there is not a similar resolution for the elbow or for the other bodily parts. So, if you claim the presence of the head, then you are in contadiction with the image that yourself showed us in your paper : “Can the Jospice Mattress Imprint be compared to the Image on the Shroud?” Another interesting question: I don’t know if you are right with your definition : polypropylene mattress because Dr. Fred Zugibe wrote something about a polyamidic material, covered with polyurethane … B.T.W. : Why you have not taken into account (in that your old paper) what wrote Dr. Fred Z ? It’s common opinion opinion that Shroud image is not truly similar to the Jospice Mattress Imprint. As you can read Dr. Zugibe (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/mattress.pdf) indicated interesting the features: >Fiber Composition = Nylon 6 (polyurethane coat) >Nature of Image = Bilirubin Pigments???? >The manufacturers indicated that the nylon was nylon 6 and that the outside coating was polyurethane. In any case: Polyamide is not polypropylene and polyurethane is not polypropylene. So, before to start with Metaphysical Travels on Jospice Imprint (in my opinion the Holy Shroud is another case, Jesus! Because, according to the doctrine of the Christian Faith, Jesus was/is God and man, then, “two species” are present in the nature of Jesus, the Son of God) we have to know what we have in front. Applied Materials Science can help us. Probably careful SPM controls can solve that enigma. If we are not able to solve this “little enigma”, then the door is open to the Parapsychology, Religion or unkown Physics … I am not an expert in the field of Parapsychological phenomena, I only want to see where is the chemical truth in this strange phenomenon and then I can only to start with a model. A model near the presumed pathway (possibly developed with maximum likelihood)… Where are the most acute analytical minds? For example, I have found an old (2005) “SNOM study”: Investigation of dyed human hair fibres using apertureless near field scanning optical microscopy F. Formanek, Y. De Wilde, G. S. Luengo & B. Querleux “Journal of Microscopy”, Vol. 224, Pt 2 November 2006, pp. 197–202 (Received 14 October 2005; accepted 24 May 2006) If using the SNOM you can see the hair (year = 2005), then you can also observe (in 2014 … …or when?) the polyamide fibers and thin layers of polyurethane… In conclusion: we can not put everything in a pot: Holy Shroud, the Holy Face of Manoppello, physical imprint of the poor died in Liverpool, Padre Pio Handkerchief, and so on… without studying fine details (in a careful manner!).

It is well known that the hardness of process water can cause different types of problems in textile processing. Water quality is the first thing for successful wet processing in textiles. I mentioned the issue of water hardness as emblematic reference. For example: if you work with hard water you do not get a good cold dyeing of polyamidic carpets. Have you tried to control what is the hardness of the water of Liverpool? Dyers needed clean, soft water… In fact there is soft (= S) water in Liverpool, that contributed to develop the textile industry. A constant supply of clean soft water was an absolute necessity for the dyer. Even the modern dyehouses are heavily dependent on the use of softened water… Also some chemicals like electrolytes and metal contamination of fiber by naturally or during production are responsible for hardness of bath water. That is why the total hardness of bath water should be maintained at a minimum level. In any case the addition of the tetrasodium salt of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) [… or other chelating products] permits to bypass some problem of water hardness (EDTA is a chelating agent and chelating agents are used to eliminate water hardness and heavy metals…). Here I do not discuss the telergy … or telepathy or other parapsychological phenomena. Do you know all the Basic Principles of Textile Coloration ?

The formation of capillary water bridges increases the shear modulus of the sand, which facilitates the sliding. Too much water, on the other hand, makes the capillary bridges coalesce, resulting in a decrease of the modulus; in this case, we observe that the friction coefficient increases again. Our results, therefore, show that the friction coefficient is directly related to the shear modulus; this has important repercussions for the transport of granular materials.

Answer: >All of us have a number of naturally occurring radionuclides within our bodies. The major one that produces penetrating gamma radiation that can escape from the body is a radioactive isotope of potassium, called potassium 40. This radionuclide has been around since the birth of the earth and is present as a tiny fraction of all the potassium in nature. >Potassium 40 (40 K) is the primary source of radiation from the human body for two reasons. First, the 40 K concentration in the body is fairly high. Potassium is ingested in many foods that we eat and is a critically important element for proper functioning of the human body; it is present in pretty much all the tissues of the body. The amount of the radioactive isotope 40 K in a 70 kg person is about 5,000 Bq, which represents 5,000 atoms undergoing radioactive decay each second. >Second, 40 K emits gamma rays in a little over 10 percent of its decays and most of these gamma rays escape the body. A gamma ray is emitted in about one out of every 10 disintegrations of 40 K, implying that about 500 gamma rays are produced each second. These will be moving in all directions, some will be attenuated in the body, and the dose rate from these gamma rays outside of the individual’s body will represent a very small fraction of the normal background dose rate from all natural sources outside the body. >If a person is above average in weight, the dose rate outside of this person’s body will expectedly be higher than the dose outside the body of a lower weight individual. In both cases, however, the dose rate will be extremely small compared to the normal background dose rate. The heavier person will receive a greater internal dose because the decay of the 40 K produces other low penetrating radiation (beta radiation) that deposits its energy within the body. However, the dose to the heavier individual will not be significantly different from that to the lower weight individual because the energy deposited per unit body mass is the dose determining factor, and this will be about the same for both individuals. >There are many other radionuclides in the human body, but these either are present at lower levels than 40 K (for example, 238 U, 232 Th, and their decay products) or they do not emit gamma rays that can escape the body (for example, 14 C and 87 Rb). Radon (and its decay products) is not a significant source of radiation from humans because it is present at very low levels in the body. >There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. … Link: http://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/faqradbods.html — — — So, our body (with the normal levels of radiation) can not produce an Image like that of the Shroud Then … Do you think at “enhanced radioactive emissions” as “possible solution” of the problem?

So… I believe that you know what are the gases and the products of combustion. Otherwise you have to read what is inherent to: C o m b u s t i o n a n d C h e m i s t r y. – Formaldehyde (History = Formaldehyde was described in the year 1855 by the Russian scientist Alexander Michailowitsch Butlerow). Formaldehyde from Combustion. The combustion of wood is a natural source of formaldehyde. Hedberg et al. Have studied birch combustion and report formaldehyde emission rates of 180−710 mg/kg wood. (Reference: Hedberg E.; Kristensson A.; Ohlsson M.; Johansson C.; Johansson P. Å.; Swietlicki E.; Vesely V.; Wideqvist U.; Westerholm R. Atmos. Environ. 2002, 36, 4823) So, the formation of formaldehyde from combustion processes is well known. The emission rate is often presented in the unit μg g−1 (mass emitted per mass of material burnt). Lee and Wang measured formaldehyde concentrations up to 300 μg m−3 in a 18.26 m3 test chamber when burning incense sticks. The emission rate was 300−1700 μg per g stick. See also wood combustion and cigarette smoking … Baek and Jenkins measured an average formaldehyde concentration of 234 μg m−3 when six cigarettes were smoked in a 30 m3 chamber under almost static conditions. A study by Baker with 13 experimental cigarettes (saccharides added) gave emission rates between 30 μg g−1 and 57 μg per cigarette smoked. In the study by Singer et al., distinctly higher formaldehyde emission rates of 950−1310 μg per cigarette smoked were measured. Maroni et al. Report 70−100 μg formaldehyde in the undiluted mainstream smoke of nonfilter cigarettes and 0.2 mg per cigarette in sidestream smoke. According to Baker et al., formaldehyde is mainly generated from the pyrolysis of saccharides used as tobacco ingredients.

In an experimental study using radiolabeled glucose and sucrose added to research cigarettes, up to 0.06% of the label was found in acetaldehyde (Gager et al., 1971b), which at a sugar application level of 5% (40 mg per cigarette) would translate to an ingredient related contribution to the overall acetaldehyde yield of approximately 5%, assuming an average overall yield of acetaldehyde of approximately 500 μg per cigarette. Taken together, sugars used as ingredients do not produce greater yields of acetaldehyde in mainstream smoke than are produced from tobacco itself… … Link: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3296517/ — — — Trying to read something about air sampling in occupational environments I have found an article: “Chemosorption sampling and analysis of formaldehyde in air.

Perfumes, oils, and other fragrances played a key role in the process of mummifying a body for burial, as well as denoting what status the person held in life. Scientists have learned so much about the people of the past from studying mummified human remains, and much of the credit goes directly to the oils and perfumes that still reside within the bodies. Scented oils were used as early as 10,000 BCE to help combat body odor and to soften the skin. Some of the most common scents used by the Egyptians were thyme, lavender, peppermint, cedar, rose, almond oil, and aloe. While providing a definitive use in life, these scents also had a purpose in death – namely, the process of Egyptian mummification. The famous method of embalming was developed around 2600 BCE (it does not appear that embalming was practiced by the Hebrews).

We know that with the Incarnation the Son of God became man, with Death and subsequent Resurrection Life of the Son of God passed by the Incarnation on this Earth to the Mystery of Life Eternal. ——————— I do not think you can get to say that the Resurrection is arising from a disembodiment of God (perhaps the only infinitesimal moment of the passing of His Body from this World [perishable] to Eternal Life can be seen as a disembodiment, that what may seem the “true Death of God” … a real “disappearance infinitesimal” …). Also I think that a “disembodiment of God” is a strange theological concept and I do not think anyone has ever deepened. Anyway I’ll try to read up about another time … — — — Now I can not immediately put to argue that, in this step, can not be originated trace extremely significant (ie: the effects of nuclear radiation … and many other gadgets you want to bring up …), but my mind can understand very well that if there is a test observable (ascertainable by anyone with the will to investigate, of course …) of something that is not belonging to the ordinary “natural course of events”, then varies the normal condition of man’s freedom before the Mystery of God … In short, free will it can be “crippled” in the sense that in front of “incontrovertible material evidence” of the Resurrection of Jesus (… And this, in a nutshell, what this means? The likely elimination of a Mystery of Faith! That is a fact not permitted by the normal Christian doctrine …) we would not be free (in our belief) but conditioned by a test material … and therefore the merit of our faith would be much diminished, or perhaps (even) voided (… and, among other things, about what I keep doubts) … So that account (consequential) can be drawn? I take it you do not find what they say Antonacci and Linder (= evidence of nuclear radiation, isotopic significant changes, etc.) …and others (Siefker) … “Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?” = 1 Corinthians 15:12 You may get to deduct that existed the Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ (from the testimony of the disciples, the Eucharistic miracles, etc., Etc.), but give the proof of this on the basis of material effects even currently observable (= altered by nuclear radiation, etc.). I think both act contrary to common sense … The Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ was and is only made in the hearts of the disciples, in the conversion … What Hope to save us we could have if we did not have more merits resulting from the Faith? In conclusion: Science can not explain a mystery of faith. Science is the result of a human construction (and it is coming from the origins sometimes obscure or even mysterious connections = see f.e. The life of Newton […and what seems to us to be able to classify as his biblical and alchemical rantings. B.T.W. : Isaac Newton wrote fellow alchemist Robert Boyle a letter urging him to keep “high silence” in publicly discussing the principles of alchemy…]) during centuries … and sometimes fallible … really it is not infallible … If science comes to really explain a mystery of Faith, then it seems to me possible to infer that the Mystery, in a certain sense, is no longer a mystery, it has become something demonstrated that one can not subtract, and, consequentially, the degree of freedom of man facing a Mystery revealed it is involved … — * — * — I’d be really curious (and at the same time, almost very intimidated …) if the predictions of Lindner (= radiocarbon dates move into the future!) come true (established after the appropriate controls) … In fact: what sense could have that “radiocarbon date in the future,” seen as “proof of the Resurrection”? In that case we would have still kept our freedom? No doubt it would be a major stumbling block … and perhaps the only logical explanation that would be immediately indicated would be the objection that these radiocarbon results in the future would result from netron irradiation of the Cloth, presumably in modern times … Strange stories … Perhaps it is better to work in our field more restricted. So the strange matter about emanations of neutrons arising from piezonuclear reaction would not be even a story to be discarded altogether. But apparently this is weak thinking. In any case turns up the question: … at what epoch would receive the Cloth a neutron irradiation?

Due to the high linear energy transfer value, sensors designed to detect such radiation require placement in close proximity to the radiation source. Here we report the morphological changes and optical responses of artificially designed DNA thin films in response to exposure to alpha radiation as observed by an atomic force microscope, a Raman and a reflectance spectroscopes. In addition, we discuss the feasibility of a DNA thin film as a radiation sensing material. The effect of alpha radiation exposure on the DNA thin film was evaluated as a function of distance from an 241 Am source and exposure time. Significant reflected intensity changes of the exposed DNA thin film suggest that a thin film made of biomolecules can be one of promising candidates for the development of online radiation sensors. — — The unexpected nuclear accidents = See also: The Fukushima nuclear accident on March 2011, etc. … The radiation effect on thin films was also studied using Raman spectroscopic analysis to determine the influence of exposure time and the distance of the film from the radiation source. Then, please, observe the comparative Raman spectra without and with radiation exposure… The radiation source (in that work) 241 Am, emits alpha particles. And alpha particles, consisting of helium nuclei, are emitted by various isotopes of actinides including Th, U, Np, Pu, Am and Cm. … So it remains to see the composition of the stones of the walls where the Holy Shroud was guarded.

Such forces are potentially damaging, particularly to thin or delicate samples. Recently, researchers have demonstrated a solution to this dilemma. The new method enables AFM measurements of elastic modulus with forces less than 20 n N, roughly 10 times the force needed to break a single atomic bond. — — Jason P Killgore and Donna C Hurley 2012 Nanotechnology 23 055702 doi:10.1088/0957 4484/23/5/055702 Low force AFM nanomechanics with higher eigenmode contact resonance spectroscopy link : http://iopscience.iop.org/0957 4484/23/5/055702/ >Atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods for quantitative measurements of elastic modulus on stiff (>10 G Pa) materials typically require tip–sample contact forces in the range from hundreds of nanonewtons to a few micronewtons. Such large forces can cause sample damage and preclude direct measurement of ultrathin films or nanofeatures. Here, we present a contact resonance spectroscopy AFM technique that utilizes a cantilever’s higher flexural eigenmodes to enable modulus measurements with contact forces as low as 10 n N, even on stiff materials. Analysis with a simple analytical beam model of spectra for a compliant cantilever’s fourth and fifth flexural eigenmodes in contact yielded good agreement with bulk measurements of modulus on glass samples in the 50–75 G Pa range. In contrast, corresponding analysis of the conventionally used first and second eigenmode spectra gave poor agreement under the experimental conditions. We used finite element analysis to understand the dynamic contact response of a cantilever with a physically realistic geometry. Compared to lower eigenmodes, the results from higher modes are less affected by model parameters such as lateral stiffness that are either unknown or not considered in the analytical model. Overall, the technique enables local mechanical characterization of materials previously inaccessible to AFM based nanomechanics methods. ————————————————— There are two systems : flexural tests and indentation tests… For this second system, see the nanoindentation : >Nanoindentation is a variety of indentation hardness tests applied to small volumes.

Link: http://rt.com/news/185876 universe elimination higgs boson/ With a sarcastic note in fact Hawking adds that “a particle accelerator capable of reaching 100 billion Ge V would be bigger than the Earth, and it is unlikely that we can get the funding to make it happen in the current economic climate.” According to the physicist, however, in the event that it be built, the Higgs boson “could become metastable at energies exceeding 100 billion giga electron volts (Ge V).” Basically, if scientists were to undertake a similar experiment, the universe could suffer a catastrophic decay of the vacuum, ie, the bubble of the true vacuum would expand at the speed of light.

For over 7 years the cloth was secretly stored below the altar of the chapel, where the Benedictine monks used to celebrate the Vespers. — — — The most extraordinary Christian icon, until then had been kept in the chapel of the Royal Palace of Turin, was transported first to Rome where it was temporarily placed into the chapel “Guido Reni” of Quirinale, where resided the Savoy, a place that was not deemed safe … Abbot Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone was summoned (by telegram of September 7) to the Secretary of State of the Vatican, Cardinal Luigi Maglione, who told him that the choice for the temporary storage of the Shroud had fallen on the Benedictine monastery of Irpinia, where 25 September 1939, surrounded by more jealous secrecy, the precious relic was transferred by car, with no apparent military escort. In the minutes of delivery signed by Abbot Marcone, by Canon Paul Brusa, guardian of the Holy Shroud, the prior of Montevergine, Bernardo Rabasca and the chaplain of the King, Joseph Gariglio, were contained all the provisions … In an additional report was settled that, in the event of air strikes on Avellino, (as tragically occurred in September 14, 1943…) for greater precaution the abbot of Montevergine would cure to transport it in an even more secure: an artificial tunnel dug into the rock one hundred meters away from Coretto, which is accessed through the hall of the monastery, without the need to go outdoors. The choice of the Montevergine sanctuary was a good one. One imagines that other such sites, such as the abbey of Monte Cassino, might have been chosen… (>The Benedictine monastery at Monte Cassino, about 90 miles (150 kilometers) to the northwest, was heavily bombed by the Allies in 1944, and many Savoy family documents about the shroud that were placed there for safekeeping during the war were destroyed, Cardin said. … link: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/10/shroud of turin going bac n 532856.html ) In 1946, after the war, before leaving for exile after the institutional referendum that sanctioned the Republican choice, King Umberto II June 10 with a letter instructing the Archbishop of Turin Maurilio Fossati to obtain the return of the relic to the city of Turin. The cardinal himself, as recounted in a letter written two days later, he came to Montevergine October 28 and, after checking the integrity of the seals, the ceremony ended with a charming stay in Irpinia of precious cloth. — — — — >The Holy Shroud was transferred from Turin during World War II to keep it out of reach of Adolph Hitler, according to a Benedictine priest in a southern Italian abbey. … >The secret was kept throughout the war despite a search of the premises carried out by German soldiers in 1943 following a bombing of Avellino. The relic was protected, said Fr. Cardin, as, upon hearing of the coming of the soldiers, the monks retired to pray at the altar. “An officer,” he explained, “seeing them in prayer, gave the order not to disturb (them) and that was how the sacred relic went undiscovered.” >Hitler apparently sought the linen for its “sacred power.” Perhaps he was obsessed with the occult and with religious artifacts… Link: http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/holy shroud hidden from hitlers grasp in benedictine abbey/ — — — Have you read the presentation by Skurka?

Sorry!): >September 1939: six days after the German invasion of Poland, the sacred cloth according to the Christians has wrapped the body of Christ in the Sepulchre left Turin for the first time in almost four centuries. Destination, dark abbey avellinese: Montevergine. Officially, it was necessary to protect the only relic from the bombing, but the real fear was that he could throw another cross over its shadow: the Nazi swastika … >Among the documents consulted showed a singular fact: Cardinal Fossati, Archbishop of Turin, had not even been informed of the start of the Holy Shroud in Turin on 7 September 1939. One possible reason may have been the need for the Cardinal, not knowing this, he could not talk even under torture. He would go to Montevergine, after the war, to bring the Holy Shroud in Turin after obtaining the consent of King Umberto II, now in exile for a few months: a consensus being essential property of the House of Savoy, the Shroud. In a letter dated June 10, 1946, just three days before departure for exile, Umberto II wrote to Cardinal Fossati: “The current events lead me today to tell Your Eminence that – while it is my understanding that the precious relic remains sacred and inalienable heritage of my house – do right now my full consent to that returns to its pristine placement in Turin, in the chapel which bears the name. ” >In an exchange of ideas with the researcher and historian Lucan, Dr. Paul Tritto, revealed an interesting argument about a book by Giorgio Galli entitled “Hitler and magical Nazism.” [Here my note = …B.T.W.: I have bought that book several years ago…] >Tritto writes: “In the book of Galli you will find something on the relationship between the Nazis and the esoteric. Upon reading I thought credible reconstructions of Galli. Even today, I think largely valid, but Galli ends, perhaps unwittingly, to draw a picture which comes from outside the usual Hitler schizophrenic. Instead, I believe that Hitler had a vision too shiny to be conceived by the mind of a deranged. Sure, it was totally out of the normal. But I would not speak of schizophrenia; perhaps his was a diabolical design or even the result of a personality “possessed”. Perhaps it is a case of demonic possession. I do not think, therefore, that Hitler wanted to take possession of the Shroud for esoteric rites. In my opinion the Shroud had to represent for him the symbol of something, then had a meaning more realistic. I also cite another book “Conversations with Hitler” Hermann Rauschning. In a chapter called “the Antichrist” the author refers to private conversations in which Hitler had explicitly expressed the intention “of radically eradicate Christianity in Germany with all its roots and its branches.” But it is not a simple hostility to support this diabolical plan, there is rather the intention of usurping the place of the Catholic Church in its mission to redeem humanity. Rauschning reports that Hitler once said: “I want to reveal a secret. Foundations with an Order. “The goal, says Rauschning, was to transform the SS into a kind of caste of priests secrets. The same author also reports that one day a woman in his entourage gave Hitler a strange suggestion that seems to have influenced him; she advised him to follow the path of “white magic” and be wary instead from “black magic”. The most powerful talisman of white magic is considered quite the Holy Shroud. Perhaps it was this – concludes Paul Tritto – the path that led Hitler to design of possession. ” — — — But luckily in Germany not everyone thought like Hitler! Unfortunately >On 19 January 1944 Moltke was arrested and the Kreisau Circle fell into disarray. The focus of some circle members had been turning towards an active political coup, and some participated in the failed assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler by Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg on July 20, 1944. After the failure of this plot, many members of the Circle were arrested and were executed. Libnk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kreisau Circle So I wonder how a highly efficient information network could not know anything about the fate of the Shroud. … Do they thought that this relic was transferred to Monte Cassino? In each case the systems of intelligence (= Monarchy and Vatican) had been effective in hiding the information to the German Nazis … Maybe you can make a comparison with a “parallel case”, namely that of “The Library of the Jewish Community of Rome” … Today there is an article in an italian newspaper (“Corriere della Sera”) about that “Library of the Jewish Community of Rome”, this article is titled: “Roman Jews (and the police) chasing the stolen library.” >In 1943 the Nazi raid to document the “lost civilization”. >Lost track of 7000 volumes.

The “partial head imprint” is only a very bad stain and cannot be compared with the Holy Shroud of Turin. That’s a horrible stain, not recognizable as a head! A good dyeing of textile materials requires that the phenomena connected with the dyeing, such as the dye take up by, and the migration of the dyes in the fibre of the material, occur in an optimal way. These phenomena are influenced by a considerable number of variants, such as the nature of the material to be dyed, the composition of the dye bath, with respect to the dyestuffs and to other substances it may contain, temperature diagram of the dyeing process, the duration of its several stages, and so forth… Are you perhaps a dyer ….? Do you want to know more than me in terms of dye? Do you want to become a dyer? You can buy special acid dyes that work especially well on nylon. They are called acid dyes because they are used with a mild acid, such as vinegar. In any case, nylon, unlike cotton, needs some acid to take up the dye.

It was previously thought that the surface tension of tears was due to dissolved mucin, but it has recently been shown that very little mucin is present. The surface tensions of solutions of commercial mucin, lysozyme, lactoferrin or secretory Ig A are all higher than that of tears. The influence of tear lipocalin and lipids remained to be tested. Methods. Surface tension was determined by a micro method on pooled. Intact stimulated human tears, and following extraction with lipid solvents. The extracted material was also added back, as was a variety of lipid standards (phospholipids, glycolipids, sterols, etc.). TLC and GLC were used in partial identification of the extract. Another lipocalin, bovine ß lactoglobulin, was also tested alone and mixed with tear lipids, model lipids, or model tear proteins. Results. Intact tears had a surface tension of 42 46 m N/m, but after lipid extraction this rose to 53 55.5 m N/m. Addition of lipids to the delipidised tear fluid gave a range of tensions from 42 to 49 m N/m, with the greatest effects shown by phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin), but full recovery was only achieved by using the extracted lipid material. … … etc. … … Link: http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1076/ceyr.19.1.4.5341 — — So… I hope to read no irreverent comments on these easy suggestions of “AFM research on linens sprayed on by tears”.

By varying the upper bound of correlation coefficient between absorbance and analyte’s content, the CCO PLS method achieved multi band selection. Two PLS based methods, which used a waveband having positive peaks of the first loading vector (FLV) and a combination of positive peaks of the correlation coefficient spectrum, were also conducted for comparison. Based on the leave one out cross validation for CCO PLS, appropriate waveband combinations for ALB and GLB were selected, the root mean square errors of prediction for validation samples were 1.36 and 1.35 (g L−1) for ALB and GLB, respectively, which were better than the two comparison methods. The CCO PLS method provided a new approach for multi band selection to achieve high analytical accuracy for molecular absorption bands that were composed of several spaced wavebands. — — — Dear “daveb of wellington nz”, perhaps our friend Colin knows the article: “PLS regression methods” by Agnar Höskuldsson.

PLSR and PCR are both methods to model a response variable when there are a large number of predictor variables, and those predictors are highly correlated or even collinear. Both methods construct new predictor variables, known as components, as linear combinations of the original predictor variables, but they construct those components in different ways. PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all. On the other hand, PLSR does take the response variable into account, and therefore often leads to models that are able to fit the response variable with fewer components.

Although Herodias did not have to go into exile she chose to follow her husband. Antipas’ territories were given to Agrippa (Jos. Antiq. 7. 1 2 ; 240 255; War ii. 9. 6 ; 181 183).

Any such hesitations, however, form no part of the Pope’s thinking. >Laudato Si’ appears closely to reflect the influence of the environmentalist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a pillar of the UN’s tendentiously political Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), who has been described in the New York Times as “a scientist known for his aggressive stance on climate policy” and who the Pope recently appointed to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, despite his other beliefs (he is hardly a Catholic thinker). >As the Vatican correspondent Edward Pentin comments: “Critics have warned that by falling in with proponents of climate change science, the Pope risks getting too close to other key supporters of the theory who support population control and abortion.” >Schellnhuber, perhaps not surprisingly given his current prominence as a papal adviser, claims not to be in favour of population control, but that is of course ridiculous, and even in the recent interview with Pentin in which he is taken to be repudiating the idea of limiting the world’s population, he can’t hide his real underlying assumptions. >Here he is: “If you want to reduce human population, there are wonderful means: Improve the education of girls and young women. Then the demographic transition will be a little bit faster… So I subscribe to a good education, and that’s the only way of population strategy I would support.” In other words, teach the girls about artificial birth control. “If you want to reduce human population”, he says. Well, there’s no if about it: the fact is that he clearly does want to reduce the human population. That’s population control. It is nonsense for him to deny he’s not in favour of it. Does he think we are all fools? >Parts of the encyclical are crude in the extreme. “A number of scientific studies indicate,” says Pope Francis, though without specifying which, “that most [that’s right, he says ‘most’] global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly [I repeat “mainly”] as a result of human activity.” Actually, only about five per cent of present atmospheric carbon dioxide is derived from the use of fossil fuels; that is, just 19 parts of CO2 per million parts of atmosphere. Most CO2 is a natural part of the atmosphere. It is not pollution: indeed, human life is largely dependent on it since without CO2 there could be no growth of any kind of vegetable matter: no CO2, no trees. No trees, no oxygen. And yet Francis writes that “Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain”: It’s a dubious theory put forward by some: but it is far from having been proved. >The danger of getting too closely involved in the politics of climate change is that they destructively divert our attention, (and that “our” includes the Pope himself), from a political imperative one would have thought much closer to the heart of what Francis, and with him the Church, really cares about. He has always claimed, with evident sincerity, to be on the side of the poor. And yet he attacks fossil fuels, their chief energy source, which he does admit are “at the heart of the worldwide energy system”. … … etc. … … etc. … Link: http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2015/06/24/following st francis the pope teaches concern for nature but laudato si will bring no justice for the poor/ So… What is your own opinion ? — — — — So, after a while we will find ourselves discussing about ecology and maybe also around the “misteries” about Rennes le Chateau!

I beg pardon … Here another reference : Development and trends in synchrotron studies of ancient and historical materials Loïc Bertrand, Marine Cotte, Marco Stampanoni, Mathieu Thoury Federica Marone Sebastian Schöder Abstract : >Synchrotron photon based methods are increasingly being used for the physico chemical study of ancient and historical materials (archaeology, palaeontology, conservation sciences, palaeo environments). In particular, parameters such as the high photon flux, the small source size and the low divergence attained at the synchrotron make it a very efficient source for a range of advanced spectroscopy and imaging techniques, adapted to the heterogeneity and great complexity of the materials under study. The continuous tunability of the source — its very extended energy distribution over wide energy domains (me V to ke V) with a high intensity — is an essential parameter for techniques based on a very fine tuning of the probing energy to reach high chemical sensitivity such as XANES, EXAFS, STXM, UV/VIS spectrometry, etc. The small source size attained (a few micrometres) at least in the vertical plane leads to spatial coherence of the photon beams, giving rise in turn to a series of imaging methods already crucial to the field. This review of the existing literature shows that microfocused hard X ray spectroscopy (absorption, fluorescence, diffraction), full field X ray tomography and infrared spectroscopy are the leading synchrotron techniques in the field, and presents illustrative examples of the study of ancient and historical materials for the various methods. Fast developing analytical modalities in scanning spectroscopy (STXM, macro XRF scanning) and novel analytical strategies regarding optics, detectors and other instrumental developments are expected to provide major contributions in the years to come. Other energy domains are increasingly being used or considered such as far infrared and ultraviolet/visible for spectroscopy and imaging. We discuss the main instrumental developments and perspectives, and their impact for the science being made on ancient materials using synchrotron techniques..","date":"2014-02-20","mins":"10:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"id":"comment-81183","author":"piero","post":"I beg your pardon about my errors : double “I”, parchement instead of parchment … In any case Voynich was an interesting personage ….","date":"2014-02-21","mins":"12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"id":"comment-81168","author":"piero","post":"Thank you for your answers !

Tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) has been proposed as a method to spectroscopically interrogate a wide variety of chemical, biological, and material samples, with sub diffraction limited imaging capabilities. In TERS, the electromagnetic field enhancement is located at a sharp metallic tip that is irradiated with laser light. When the tip is brought close to the sample of interest, it provides a localized region of SERS enhancement, which enables structural and compositional characterization with spatial resolution of a few nanometers. … — — — >TERS uses a scanning probe microscopy (SPM) tip as an external enhancing unit. >Because the enhancement originates from an external source, this technique makes significantly enhanced Raman signals accessible for any adsorbate on any surface. >When a noble metal SPM tip is irradiated with light that excites the tip LSPR, electromagnetic ﬁeld enhancement takes place near the tip apex. >This enhancement can be used to increase the Raman scattering intensity from molecules in the vicinity of the tip, even though they are not directly adsorbed to it, due to the long range nature of the interaction between the molecules and the enhanced electromagnetic ﬁeld. >SPM tips made from or coated with Ag or Au have been shown to enhance Raman scattering intensities of molecules near the tip by 3 to 6 orders of magnitude (Pettinger et al., 2002, 2004; Watanabe et al., 2004). >An additional advantage afforded by TERS is its nanometer scale spatial resolution. >TERS combines the high sensitivity and rich chemical information content of SERS with the excellent spatial resolution provided by SPM. >TERS can provide Raman spectra with a spatial resolution near the radius ofcurvature of the SPM tip, which is far better than the diffraction limit typically encountered in optical microscopy. >For this reason, TERS has been referred to as apertureless near ﬁeld Raman spectroscopy. >TERS has been used to provide high resolution images of nanoscale samples, and since the light detected is Raman scattering, chemical information is built in.

The only New Testament writer to mention this phenomenon is Luke, a physician (Col. 4:14). Here I should write a few lines on the ancient medical knowledge and the visual examination of the Shroud … I believe that the Shroud has nothing to do with Madame Blavatsky, but … See also the possible (or impossible) connections: Shroud Antioch theory by Markwardt St Luke and the Shroud… The idea of Messiah can also be found in Buddhism, where the bodhisattva Maitreya plays a similar function as a Messiah… It is said that Maitreya’s coming will occur after the teachings of the current Buddha Gautama, the Dharma, are no longer taught and are completely forgotten… Now I apologize for the possible (great) confusion (!) occurred with the use of a series of mental associations (perhaps not always entirely consistent) … But yesterday I have spent some time rereading a book by prof. P.L. Baima Bollone: “L’ identità di Gesù. La vera storia di Gesù Bambino” (= The identity of Jesus. The true story of the Child Jesus.). This book breaks away from misconceptions (and in that book there are also reported interesting theosophical and anthroposophic tracks) and try to trace the identity of Jesus and the events of his birth on the basis of biological and natural that can be seen in the sources. Theosophy teaches the unity of man and the equality of all races, creeds, color and sex. Blavatsky believed in the world religions, and the coming of the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, the Ajita Bodhisattva, “that would return to teach the pure Dharma, at a time of darkness on the earth, when the Dharma will have been forgotten.” ( Wikipedia) So… Blavatsky believed the Returned Buddha, the Maitreya, is linked to the Return of Jesus and the other ascendant masters. Blavatsky talked of a so called Christ Principle, which in her view corresponds to the spiritual essence of every human being. Maitreya is a bodhisattva who in the Buddhist tradition is to appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor of the historic Śākyamuni Buddha. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya references a time when the Dharma will seem to be forgotten on Jambudvipa. … In his eulogy to Isaac Newton written in 1927, the bicentenary of the great man’s death, Einstein called him a “shining spirit”.

Marion concluded that the probability that the two relics (Shroud and Tunica Argenteuil) are authentic are mutually reinforcing. — — Although I am more inclined to think to the “extreme” alternative of the transport of the entire cross (and I have several doubt about the possible weight), I follow the different points of view but I do not regard as essential the disquisition about the transport on the shoulders of the poor condemned (to the sad torture) of the entire cross or only the “patibulum”… — — In my opinion what may seem disturbing in the debate is the lack of studis of Mechanics and Structural Mechanics (see also: the possible concrete effects on the body of the poor Man condemned) on the main alternatives: – The lifting of the entire cross from the ground – The use of the stipes and the patibulum I believe it is necessary to proceed gradually in the study of these problems … — — Surfing the Web … I read that in 2008 Lucotte said that we can redo the whole chain of DNA from traces or fragments. He also said that it is possible to clone a human being and that he believed this was already done… and the same researcher (Lucotte), presented as geneticist, said he found erythrocyte on Holy Tunic of Argenteuil… So we have to consider the book: “Guardare la Sindone: cinquecento anni di liturgia sindonica” (= Watching Shroud: five hundred years of liturgy Shroud) by Gian Maria Zaccone, G. Ghiberti Effata Editrice IT, 2007 – 454 pages where is the thorny issue, that I have already pointed out: Lucotte, not in his book, but in the magazine for the general public (= “Le Point”) claimed that the man of the Tunic of Argenteuil had an opium addict, of bad habits, and these claims were based on the analysis of fragments of hair … — — — Here an excerpt taken from the address: http://www.radio silence.tv/imprimer.php?menug=9&menuh=2&id Ru=267 >… The DNA. Pr. Lucotte recalls that the red blood cells which have been located on the Holy Tunic, don’t have any DNA material. However, several cells of skin, hairs, dandruff, and of white globules, which have been located on the Tunic, contain the human DNA of which the chromosomal analysis, at this stage, indicates the following certainties: a) It is human DNA b) The genetic profiles of this DNA concern only one individual. C) The specific markers mention the presence of the chromosome Y, marker of masculinity. D) The chromosomal formulas indicate a correspondence with an oriental Semitic non Arabic DNA. We got, says the professor, the DNA print (like in legal medicine) of this man according to 15 discriminative markers. >This print, like all prints, is unique and will permit useful comparisons. … So… Here there is not the claim aboout an opium addict person. Now I am curious to read what is the exact opinion by Kelly Kearse on DNA analyses conducted by Lucotte (who has found that Jesus was an opium addict with bad habits!…) — — and the name “Lucotte” also appear in the paper by Prof. Giulio Fanti: “A dozen years of Shroud Science Group” >… the Special Issue consisted of 12 papers signed by the following first authors: F.

Happy Easter ! — — — Now I only have a few lines to bring to your attention: In the article investigation “Il viaggio della Sindone” (= “The journey of the Shroud”) by Dante Matelli, appeared on “National Geographic” (number of Aprile 2015, which I bought a few days ago …), I have read that Prof. Barberis says that there are many definitions dates to the Shroud, but he likes the one that defines an image inexplicable, at least until now … since it emphasizes something that is really surprising: all the theories proposed to date to explain how the image on the Shroud are deficient. All the experiments that have attempted to reproduce the Shroud image copies produced by chemical physical characteristics very different from those of the original… and Prof. Barberis concluded: “In short, the process that caused the formation of the image remains unknown” This is what we have always heard… Although there are systems of investigation which have become refined [For example: I have pointed out the possibility of using the CFM (= Chemical Force Microscopy) and AFM Raman techniques…], I certainly don’t pretend to reveal exactly how it was formed the Shroud (ie: what was the exact process of the formation of the Imprint), what interested me in 1998, and the main point for which I am still very interested, is the problem of the dating of the Shroud. We can see ourselves the strange fact: after the intervention of Freeman (and its stress on the stories “Quem Queritis” …) and after the publication of this interesting book by Andrea Nicolotti, the assumptions on the date of origin of the Shroud now are made to converge to the Middle Ages because of a dating occurred on one corner of the Ancient Sheet … One angle can deny everything else we know? But is it a serious approach to the relic behave this way? I do not think so. The claim to date the Shroud talking about the transition from the Quem Queritis ceremony to the first claims by the de Charny family … I think it is a bit too. But Freeman does not seem to have these claims (if I am not mistaken), he merely states the historical problems, the same approach is taken by Nicolotti. So my proposal (ie: the use of advanced microscopies, in order to determine a credible historical range about the textile material) wants to be an answer also to these new claims (which I can not believe). I see that I am another time a bit vague (about the measurements for cellulosic DP using the AFM techniques.

In the past (rejected paper for Dallas Conference, 2005) I proposed the use of AFM and SSNTD to testify the level of radiations during the experiments (simulations)… Reflections on nuclear power and levels of safety in our world (and concrete steps to enhance nuclear safety for our future) are also connected to the studies about the effect of radiation on materials. A nuclear war is a catastrophic event… For example: Have you seen the effect of nuclear bomb on a cathedral in Japan (Nagasaki)? — — Links: http://www.ccwatershed.org/blog/2013/aug/9/1949 mass ruins nagasaki cathedral/ http://www.schola sainte cecile.com/2013/08/09/et dieu essuiera toutes les larmes de leurs yeux nagasaki 9 aout 1945/ — — So… We have to show (using linen fibrils…) what happens after the use of nuclear bombs. For example: Now the situation in East Ukraine is bad but I don’t believe that the rebels or government of Ukraine or new political and economic characters who want to revive “the glorious czarist past” want to use nuclear weapons to solve their difficult geopolitic economic problems. But sometimes the History gets out of hand its protagonists. See what happened after the famous attack in Sarajevo in 1914 (= WWI). Perhaps the irradiation work can be difficult to obtain (…when we are not high level scientists or true experts in the matter). — — *** — — Here I return on my previous message. Unfortunately I don’t know what are the complete results obtained by Prof. Andy Merrywheater (a world class expert on ancient blood) on degraded DNA coming from the Shroud. Do you know what was obtained (working on small segments of DNA available for replication)? So… Here (avoiding biogenetic derives and vague protein engineering ideas…) I want to underline which were the adequate words (about linen fibrils = lignocellulosic material) to quote (speaking from a textile perspective): >… When measuring elasticity or other mechanical properties of a sample, you’ll want a softer cantilever with a low spring constant so that the cantilever can detect small change in force. Another point: >Good data depends on the quality of your experimental setup.

One of these sites, the ‘Sima de los Huesos’ (‘pit of bones’), has yielded the world’s largest assemblage of Middle Pleistocene hominin fossils, consisting of at least 28 individuals dated to over 300,000 years ago. The skeletal remains share a number of morphological features with fossils classified as Homo heidelbergensis and also display distinct Neanderthal derived traits. Here we determine an almost complete mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos and show that it is closely related to the lineage leading to mitochondrial genomes of Denisovans, an eastern Eurasian sister group to Neanderthals.

I think the problem of bleaching is still interesting. For example: I have never seen a comparison about colored linens from Di Lazzaro and samples (from these linens) that were subjected to Na Cl O bleaching. Most likely there is a difference between the linen samples treated with “Xe Cl laser” (308 nm) and those with “Ar F laser” (193 nm). But I think that a certain amount of color is still visible (although, probably, with a reduced contrast with the surrounding areas). In other words there is only a partial bleaching. I understand that you cannot work on VUV excimer laser treated samples, but you can try to do something on CD (= Corona Discharge) treated linens because this is a more easy way to treat the textile material… If you cannot work, then try to ask a treated linen sample to Di Lazzaro and/or Fanti. I am interested in discussions about this work because we can guess something about the depth of color penetration. For example: probably with a Xe Cl Laser [308 nm. Result= brownish color. Instead (if i am right) an “Ar F laser” produces a yellowish coloration…] there is a more deep penetration. What is your opinion? Have you an idea how to treat treated (and/or irradiated) linens in a washing machine?

Maybe there were line problems or other causes. I hope that this never happens again. — — — Here what I have found surfing the Web today: >1. – Where were the Jerusalem samples taken? Dr. Nitowsky (Sr. Damian of the Cross) sampled in Israel, nine sites which included: 1. Emmaus; 2. Jericho, at Herod’s palace; 3. Qumran ; 4. Beth Shan ; 5 Sepphoris; 6 and 7 Beth She’arim; 8 Jerusalem; 9. Mt Carmel”. The Jerusalem samples are further identified as in the École Biblique tomb complex and more particularly from the bench of the tomb.” >2. … … omitted … … >3. – How was the Aragonite identified from Jerusalem? >Kohlbeck analysed with the microscope thin sections of the Jerusalem tomb and he concluded was Aragonite. The strongest way to distinguish Aragonite from Calcite is the X ray diffraction to determine the crystalline structure. However, this test was never mentioned. But Kohlbeck should be able to recognize through the microscope the aragonite versus the common calcite. Nevertheless, this is not the key question because actually, Aragonite is very spread and very common. It should be easy to find Aragonite in the Jerusalem rock and in the Shroud too and its presence in the Shroud cannot be taken as a clue of its stay in Jerusalem. Only specific traces (iron and strontium) could give an indicative fingerprint. Kohlbeck applied the X Ray fluorescence method to detect traces of iron and strontium and being not able to find lead. It is the further analysis conducted by Dr. Riccardo Levi Setti through his high resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy that provided the true “little DNA” or “finger print” to be compared with the samples of the Shroud (fibers). Link: http://www.holyshroudguild.org/cesar2.html — — — SIMS link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary ion mass spectrometry — — — >Ion microprobes, also known as secondary ion mass spectrometers (SIMS), use a finely focused ion beam to probe a selected sample domain. A small percentage of the material sputtered from the polished surface of the sample is ionized, and these ions are accelerated into a mass spectrometer where they are separated according to their mass over charge ratio. An important characteristic of SIMS is its high sensitivity compared to other microbeam sampling techniques: the ability to count individual ions results in detection limits in the parts per billion range for many elements. Also the fact that ions derived from the sample are separated by their mass over charge ratio allows isotopic analyses to be performed on test portion masses that can be as small as 200 picograms.

Due to the acceleration of the extracted sample ions to Me V energies and their charge reversal from negative to positive ions, Super SIMS can reach about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower detection limits (up to 10 12 or ppt, highly depending on analyte and matrix) as conventional SIMS. … Link: http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?p Nid=2809.","date":"2014-09-30","mins":"8:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/28/searching-stephen-jones-quotation-archives/","cat":"quotations","title":"Searching Stephen Jones’ Quotation Archives"},{"id":"comment-143094","author":"piero","post":"So … We have to check what was the right age about three different epochs : 1a 16th century (Duchess Margaret of Austria) 1b 1694 Sebastian Valfré 2 1864/68 Princess Clothild Is it possible to believe in a simple solution for that (little) enigma ?

Cellulose nanocrystals (CN Cs) are one group of nanoparticles that have high potential economic value but present substantial challenges to the development of the measurement science. Even the largest trees owe their strength to this newly appreciated class of nanomaterials. Cellulose is the world’s most abundant natural, renewable, biodegradable polymer. Cellulose occurs as whisker like microfibrils that are biosynthesized and deposited in plant material in a continuous fashion. The nanocrystals are isolated by hydrolyzing away the amorphous segments leaving the acid resistant crystalline fragments. Therefore, the basic raw material for new nanomaterial products already abounds in nature and is available to be utilized in an array of future materials. However, commercialization requires the development of efficient manufacturing processes and nanometrology to monitor quality. This paper discusses some of the instrumentation, metrology and standards issues associated with the ramping up for production and use of CN Cs.

Gibson DOI: 10.1098/rsif.2012.0341 Published 7 November 2012 Abstract The cell walls in plants are made up of just four basic building blocks: cellulose (the main structural fibre of the plant kingdom) hemicellulose, lignin and pectin. Although the microstructure of plant cell walls varies in different types of plants, broadly speaking, cellulose fibres reinforce a matrix of hemicellulose and either pectin or lignin. The cellular structure of plants varies too, from the largely honeycomb like cells of wood to the closed cell, liquid filled foam like parenchyma cells of apples and potatoes and to composites of these two cellular structures, as in arborescent palm stems. The arrangement of the four basic building blocks in plant cell walls and the variations in cellular structure give rise to a remarkably wide range of mechanical properties: Young’s modulus varies from 0.3 M Pa in parenchyma to 30 G Pa in the densest palm, while the compressive strength varies from 0.3 M Pa in parenchyma to over 300 M Pa in dense palm. The moduli and compressive strength of plant materials span this entire range. This study reviews the composition and microstructure of the cell wall as well as the cellular structure in three plant materials (wood, parenchyma and arborescent palm stems) to explain the wide range in mechanical properties in plants as well as their remarkable mechanical efficiency.

(April 18, 2012) — — So… Try to produce something using the dry dust drawing technique Craig and Bresee described in 1994! You can use dry powdered Ferric Oxide (because Fe203 was reportedly found in significant amounts in image areas on the Shroud as reported by Heller, Adler, and Pellicori). Here a question connected with a phenomenon… I have read that color intensity of Ferric Oxide can change in direct proportion to changes in atmospheric humidity. Do you agree on that? Another question connected with the previous fact: Accetta and Baumgart noted variations in the spectrum on the TS when they conducted their infrared reflectance spectroscopy and thermographic investigations. (Applied Optics, 1980)…”Of particular note during the course of the experiment was the relatively large fluctuations in atmospheric absorption, especially on those days when local precipitation caused high relative humidity.” Did you knew that story? Have you taken into account inherent differences (for your work)? ———————————– It was Craig’s opinion that the image was man made and any attempt to duplicate the image is only limited by one illustrator’s ability to copy the artwork of the original illustrator. Her hypothesis was that the “dust drawing” technique can be utilized to produce an image which has all of the physical characteristics of the image on the Shroud cloth. But (… and in any case …) the technique proposed by E. Craig, even if very interesting and capable to reproduce many of the physico chemical characteristics of the Shroud of Turin, was not able to reproduce some typical characteristics of the Shroud detectable at microscopic level!!! Here my simple conclusion: The idea to work in a similar manner seems to be an useless attempt to discredit the Shroud !!! Am I wrong in my claim? Try to work using iron oxide, raw sienna, gelatin transferred to clean dry linen… and observe the results obtained (at macro and micro levels [= observations with a microscope]).

If it is important to record the nature of pollen grains, then we have to deepen the question… If the pollen grains are powdery, dust like, this is an indication about wind pollination. Usually pollen grains are sticky in insect pollinated flowers. So we have to control what are the levels of viscoelasticity and adhesion … But, after the centuries and aging, I have several doubts about the precision of that control. Is this attempt (to verify the differences) a nonsensical control ?… ————— B.T.W. : I have not yet seen the image (photo n. 17) quoted by Maloney… — — — — I have found a study: Pollenkitt Wetting Mechanism Enables Species Specific Tunable Pollen Adhesion by Haisheng Lin , Ismael Gomez , and J. Carson Meredith School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology Publication Date (Web): February 12, 2013 Copyright © 2013 American Chemical Society Here an excerpt from the Abstract >Plant pollens are microscopic particles exhibiting a remarkable breadth of complex solid surface features. In addition, many pollen grains are coated with a viscous liquid, “pollenkitt”, thought to play important roles in pollen dispersion and adhesion. >However, there exist no quantitative studies of the effects of solid surface features or pollenkitt on adhesion of pollen grains, and it remains unclear what role these features play in pollen adhesion and transport. >We report AFM adhesion measurements of five pollen species with a series of test surfaces in which each pollen has a unique solid surface morphology and pollenkitt volume. >The results indicate that the combination of surface morphology (size and shape of echinate or reticulate features) with the pollenkitt volume provides pollens with a remarkably tunable adhesion to surfaces. THERE ARE TWO ALTERNATIVES : >With pollenkitt removed, pollen grains had relatively low adhesion strengths that were independent of surface chemistry and scalable with the tip radius of the pollen’s ornamentation features, according to the Hamaker model. >With the pollenkitt intact, adhesion was up to 3–6 times higher than the dry grains and exhibited strong substrate dependence. — — What is your own conclusion ? — — Here I want to add another excerpt from the Abstract: >The combination of high pollenkitt volume and large convex, spiny surface features in echinate entomophilous varieties appears to enhance the spreading area of the liquid pollenkitt relative to varieties of pollen with less pollenkitt volume and less pronounced surface features. — — — — What is pollenkitt? Link: http://www.honeybeesuite.com/2010/03/page/2/ >Pollenkitt is a sticky covering found on the surface of pollen grains. It is also spelled “pollen kit” or “pollenkit” and is sometimes called “pollen coat.” It is found in some plant families more often than others, but it is especially common in plants that are pollinated by insects. Because of this, scientists believe that one of the major functions of pollenkitt is to help the pollen stick to the bugs. >Honey bees have special body parts where they pack pollen to be carried back to the hive. The parts—one on each hind leg—are called corbiculae or “pollen baskets.” The corbiculae are covered with hairs which help to hold the pollen in place, but very sticky pollen can form large clumps—something that makes provisioning even easier. >The pollen from many wind pollinated plants, such as grass, is much drier and not nearly so sticky. This pollen has to be carried in smaller clumps and so the bees have to make more trips to collect an equal amount, which wastes both time and energy. … … >Plants that are insect pollinated not only have sticky pollen, they have lots of pollen. This provides the win win relationship that defines plant pollinator mutualisms. … .. >Researchers have suggested many other reasons for pollenkitt and, in truth, it probably has multiple functions. It may keep the pollen from blowing away or drying out, or it may protect the pollen from ultra violet radiation and certain pathogens. — — I hope in your comments ….","date":"2014-08-01","mins":"12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/28/a-new-paper-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A New Paper by Paul Maloney"},{"id":"comment-204859","author":"piero","post":"I have found some lines about an interesting miracle: the “Painted By Angels” (1754)… = Colombia’s Miracle Portrait of Virgin & Child… >…The Gothic style church is considered one of the architectural wonders of the world, and according to the testimonials that line the walkways leading to the church, Las Lajas is rich in miraculous cures. >Most miraculous of all, however, is the portrait of Our Lady and Child, along with St. Francis and St. Dominic, which appears to be painted on rock. >But German scientists, after boring through various parts of the “painting,” discovered that the rich surface colors are not paint, but are the actual colors of the rock, which run several feet deep. >Indeed, no one has ever come up with an explanation for the phenomenal painting. … Link: http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7471 Until now I have not yet seen the inherent scientific controls… Have you tried to find some scientific news about the “German scientists” ?

Alan Adler (source: “The orphaned manuscript”) wrote something about one class of the test objects that can be clearly identified as ferric iron oxides particles (= reddish, birefringent, pleochroic, with a positive spot test for iron only if predigested with H Cl)… In any case he (= Dr. Adler) underlined that these objects were found predominantly only in the scorched blood areas and in waterstain margins. The combustion of blood is known to produce ferric oxide and its presence in the scorched blood area was expected… Perhaps these particles were also present on original Holland backing cloth. But it should not exist a role of them in the case of thin layers on linen fibrils (= then: no as chromophore for Bodily Image). Here what I wrote few days ago (in August 14, 2015 at 5:17 am): >Yesterday, rethinking what you wrote about “Mc Crone’s tunnel vision” and the mis identification: “iron oxide as the chromophore” I was able to solve the simple problem. >In other words: the use of diimide can be understood starting from the fact of iron oxide presence, because … if you treat cotton stained with iron oxides then you create an hole on your cotton cloth. >The same can happen on linen fibrils. >So, if you destroy your proof you cannot win … >This was the point to consider. >Probably they (= “STURP”) had feared iron’s oxides presence. >Then I hope you want to pardon my previous waste of time with useless discussion. >Am I wrong in my conclusion? … etc., etc. … >Try to treat a cloth with particles of rust and then try to use Na Cl O in order to show what happens (at different p H)… >And also I think you can adequately distribute rust particles in order to make pinholes in a cloth… … etc., etc. … — — — >In Industrial works the bleaching equipment should be made of stainless steel, to avoid the catalytic degradation of the cellulose in presence of copper and iron [tank construction is stainless steel (AISI 316, etc.)]. >Before to end, few other “chemical words”. >If you want to become a good worker (…sorry!) in this textile field, then you can add an organic sequestering agent to chelate the ferrous ions and prevent redeposition or adsorption of iron compounds onto the fibers, and recovering the bleached substantially iron free fibrous cellulose. … etc., etc. … — — So: why no one told me about my solution to the “problem of the lack of use of Na Cl O”?

For example, I have found the following description: >Electrostatic painting is commonly called powder coating. It is a dry powder mix of resin and pigment. The mix is positively charged in the paint sprayer and sprayed onto the finished surface by air. The painted object is grounded to give it a negative charge. The powder is only attracted to the finished object, so it spreads uniformly over the most irregular and complicated surfaces. … Link:http://www.ehow.com/facts 6684816 kind paint used electrostatic painting .html and this one: >The term electrostatics or electrostatic spray finishing refers to a spray finishing process in which electrical charges and electric fields are used to attract particles of atomized coating material to the target (the object to be coated). In the most common types of electrostatic systems, electrical charges are applied to the coating material and the target is grounded, creating an electric field. The charged particles of coating material are drawn by the electric field to the surface of the grounded target because of the attraction of opposing electrical charges. … Here another excerpt: >In a corona charging system, a high voltage generator is used to charge an electrode at the tip of the powder gun. This creates an electrostatic field (or corona) between the gun and the substrate. >Gas molecules in the air pick up electrons emitted from the corona. This negative charge is, in turn, transferred to the powder particles as they are propelled from the gun head towards the substrate. >The charged powder particles are deposited on the earthed substrate. >Electrostatic spraying gun system has been the most popular coating methods for powder coating powder. Link: http://www.chinapowdercoating.com/tag/electrostatic spraying/page/2 So… Is it possible to think the Shroud as a sort of electrostatic painting? — — I think this idea (= the Shroud as a sort of “electrostatic painting”) has the defect of being different from what we can observe about the Shroud: looking the Shroud we see only a weak superficial action and so there is no true penetration into the material (apart from the claims by Fanti and Maggiolo about the existence of the “second face”, a phenomenon that was [interpreted in a different manner by Rogers, who, instead of the Corona Discharge, indicated the absorption desorption effect about the behavior of linen fibres] denied by Balossino …). In any case we have to test under the advanced microscope the linen fibrils coming from the Image of the Shroud, before to speak too about the hypothesis of an “event horizon” or “horizon of the Hell” or whatsoever thing you want to think… But we should also take into account the effect of the passage of time, the aging of the “mysterious picture” … this without necessarily having to arrive to the exaggerations of Charles Freeman (I hope that our poor friend Charles will forgive me for this term a bit severe…) about the past appearance of the Shroud… So, what now I want to emphasize is that we have not yet observed the aging of what was produced by Di Lazzaro (apart from a special case already considered by himself…)..","date":"2015-04-15","mins":"9:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/14/interview-with-paolo-di-lazzaro/","cat":"article","title":"Interview with Paolo Di Lazzaro"},{"id":"comment-196321","author":"piero","post":"I would add, however, an attempt of mine to clarify: I’m afraid that might happen the phenomena of “thermal pollution” during production (= adequate experiments done with the use of that polyurethane/metallic blend ) of the image on the Shroud, namely: a bit like what Rogers told me to have happened with the experiments performed (but here I speak about things of the past) from known researcher Giovanna De Liso … So, I cannot exclude a sameness to what had happened with linen fibrils produced by De Liso.

Giuseppe Ghiberti and his life in Turin, but the haughty approach by Louis about the biblical studies by Ghiberti and the attempt to dialogue with another religion during a meeting is a bit strange …or worrying…. Here I want to add few lines: although I understand the critical situation (and the urgent need to dialogue to prevent extremist acts from both followers), it’s hard to believe that Muslims [apart the strange heretic sect Ahmadhija, well known for particular ideas and strange interests about Jesus, the Rozabal, etc.] and Christians find common ground on the Shroud. Here another question (apparently far from the subject treated here): Ludvik Leibler is a French physicist who has developed a revolutionary new technique about the use of a nanoparticle solution made from polymers to connect human tissue. He has been awarded with Descartes Huygens Prize (a prize set up by the French and Dutch governments in 1995). In the past he won an ACS Award in Polymer Chemistry for his pioneering work on the self assembly of polymer systems. If we wiil be able to show the true epoch of the Ancient Linen (without to destroy the Holy Shroud!), but I don’t believe we will be in the list for these future Awards if we are not able to do something instead to discuss about the Koran. This question seems to be very important and all the scientists (independently from their religious ideas. See also the example of Pontifical Academia…) can collaborate in order to discover the truth. So, the words by Msgr. Ghiberti should be an interesting point to start toward this direction. But, knowing something about the ideas of Pallavicini (who seemed to be rigorous about Tradition, etc.), I have some doubt… because I believe thee approach by Co.re.is (Islamic religious community) to the Christian world and Tradition is a knotty problem. I like the idea nevertheless, then I hope in that possible inter religious (and also scientific, if possible…) dialogue… There is a German book that can be indicated as an exemple of what some layman can read about the Shroud: Das Jesu Komplott, by Holger Kersten and Elmar Gruber ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger Kersten ) and then a particular Islamic Tradition (connected with these ideas) can be understood [= the first book by Holger Kersten: “Jesus Lived in India” promotes the claims both of Nicolas Notovich (1894) regarding the unknown years of Jesus between the ages of 12 and 30 in India, also Ahmadiyya founder Ghulam Ahmad’s claims regarding the years aged 33 to age 120 in India, and the burial of Jesus at the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar]. But I don’t believe that Pallavicini is in this field of Islamic Tradition, then a more refined Knowledge (avoiding blasphemies!) is required to discuss a Mystery of Faith, this is an useful way for both religious fields. Perhaps there are several studies connected : – Gnostics – Liber Schale Machometi (= “Halmahereig”, translated by Abraham Alfaquim) – question of “Ascended Masters” and inherent Traditions, starting from – the ancient Pharaohs, For example: >Amenhotep III is believed to have begun his rule at about the age of nine. It is likely that a relative acted as regent for him until he came of age. As an Egyptian Pharaoh, Amenhotep III, and his wife Tiye are known as the founders of monotheism in Egypt, a practice continued and expanded by one of Amenhotep’s sons, Akhenaten, an incarnation of an ascended master … (Warning!!!

I was curious to see what were the results from the application of Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors (= SSNT Ds) in experiments about Image Formation (then: included neutron dosimetry …), but I didn’t believe in this particular way as explanation for the mysterious Image. Perhaps we can try to simulate an “AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) inspection on exposed SSNTD” model with Comsol Multiphysics. See also the useful “personnel neutron dosimetry” in nuclear plants. For this question I have found the following study: “Different etching processes of damage track detectors for personnel neutron dosimetry” by L. Tommasino, G. Zapparoli, P. Spiezia, R.V. Griffith, G. Espinosa (It is available online since 29 August 2002) Abstract >The advantages and limitations of different etching processes of CR 39 detectors for personnel neutron dosimetry are analysed. The chemical etching can be considered the converse of the electrochemical etching, since the former provides very poor response to low energy neutrons, while the latter greatly simplifies the registration of these neutrons.

Carpinteri, A. Chiodoni, A. Manuello, R. Sandrone Link: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978 1 4419 9798 2 7 Reading the inherent abstract we can see the absence of SSNTD: Abstract >In the present paper, Energy Dispersive X ray Spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on different samples of external or fracture surfaces coming from specimens used in piezonuclear tests [1,2]. For each sample, different measurements of the same crystalline phases (phengite and biotite) were performed in order to get averaged information of the chemical composition and to detect possible piezonuclear transmutations from iron to lighter elements. The results of EDS analyses show that, in the fracture surface samples, a considerable reduction in the iron content (~25%) seems to be counterbalanced by an increase in Al, Si, and Mg concentrations. Reading what is able to do EDS we can turn perplexed about what really happened in the experiments by Carpinteri : >Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy (EDS, EDX, or XEDS), sometimes called energy dispersive X ray analysis (EDXA) or energy dispersive X ray microanalysis (EDXMA), is an analytical technique used for the elemental analysis or chemical characterization of a sample. It relies on an interaction of some source of X ray excitation and a sample. Its characterization capabilities are due in large part to the fundamental principle that each element has a unique atomic structure allowing unique set of peaks on its X ray emission spectrum. … Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy — — So… What happened? Another question similar to the “C14 1988”? I don’t know… Were the results of EDS analyses a wrong approach? Were the EDS analyses wrong?

Really Carpinteri results were not replicated? Zero neutrons? Attention, please: as you can see, I am not referring to gamma rays, I only refer to the strange neutron emissions. In the article by Spallone, Calamai and Tripodi (published online in August 2010) we can read: >Mistake in the analysis of neutron detection due to intense acoustic signal or charged particle emitted in fractoemission phenomena is suggested. But EDS analyses were not mentioned… Unfortunately I have not read the entire article (only the abstract).

De Liso, C. Fidani and A. Viotto (published in “Earth Science”, February 2014): “Unusual animal behaviour before earthquakes and multiple parameter monitoring in Western Piedmont.” This note indicated the study by: Carpinteri A, Lacidogna G, Manuello A, Borla O. “Piezonuclear Transmutations in Brittle Rocks under Mechanical Loading: Microchemical Analysis and Geological Confirmations”. In Symposium on Recent Advances in Mechanics, Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece, 17 19 September, book part III: 361 382, Editors Anthony N. Kounadis, Emmanuel E. Gdoutos, Editors Affiliations: Academy of Athens, Dept. Of Civil Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace; 2009 Therefore De Liso and the other researchers of that study had chosen a rather special support (prof. Carpinteri and his particular piezonuclear claims) that now seems in doubt weight … unless extraterrestrial beings have really suggested to De Liso the right way in order to go towards the Truth … In the past De Liso was defined by Garlaschelli (link: http://www.uaar.it/news/2014/02/17/sindone terremoti intervento luigi garlaschelli/ as “soprano, painter, former sighting of aliens, now become experimental sindonologist…” (Italian words = “soprano, pittrice, ex avvistatrice di alieni, ora diventata sindonologa sperimentale”…). Now I want to clarify that I do not want to judge a researcher (Giovanna De Liso) for her claims about UF Os, abductions, etc. Unfortunately I had only exchanged few words with her in 2002 (near Paris). I have only taken note of what was written by prof. Luigi Garlaschelli (and then echoed by Nicolotti)… Was (an is) our humanity driven by extraterrestrial beings? Maybe it was better to believe the good angels, them there were not deceiving. However I think it would be better not come to confusion between extraterrestrials and angels (= pure spirits) … these are special topics. What drove Carpinteri to pursue a nuclear physics research deemed impossible by the rest of the scientific community in no time losing the authority conquered in a good career? The piezonuclear question seemed to be very controversial also because De Liso said (in an italian webpage), in a letter published in November 15, 2012 : “… we have seen neutron detectors, which marked the presence of neutrons at the time of rupture of gneiss … Link: http://oggiscienza.it/2012/10/25/istituto nazionale di ricerca in misterologia/ … and I have read on the Web that Giovanna de Liso was also named as an expert in ufology and collaborator of CUN (a Italian National “UFO Center”). * * * * * * * * * * In any case the Luserna Stone (Pietra di Luserna) >is a leucogranitic orthogneiss, characterized by a micro Augen texture, with a marked foliation that is mostly associated to a visible lineation: it geologically pertains to the Dora Maira Massif, and outcrops in a quite large area (approximately 50 km2) of the Cottian Alps, on the border between the Turin and Cuneo provinces (Piemonte, Italy)… Link: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/259080763 Quantitative phase analysis (QPA) of the Luserna Stone BTW: I remember that years ago I have read a study about: “Fine atomic image of mica cleavage planes obtaiend with an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a novel procedure for image processing” Abstract: >Potassium layers and basal oxygen layers in muscovite and biotite cleavage planes were clearly discerned by an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a novel procedure for image processing. Unit cell sizes of muscovite and biotite determined by this procedure were in good accordance with those determined by X ray structural analysis. Expected differences in the structures of muscovite and biotite, that is, the atomic arrangement of oxygen in the tetrahedral sheet, were clearly demonstrated from the processed images. Now I doubt that this technique may serve to then be able to gain more control over what is left after the fracturing process… Perhaps one can try to do some new controls on biotite cleavage planes in order to better investigate the negative problems already seen with EDS. * * * * * * * * * * * Here another question about the use of microscopy… but about Charles Freeman and not regarding De Liso or Carpinteri: I think Charles should consider the following fact: Prof. P.

As evoked by the Greek root of the word, they are caused by pressure waves, in both liquids and solids. The salient results, which have already appeared in authoritative international journals of experimental physics or mechanics, provide direct and indirect evidence of the occurrence of piezonuclear reactions. Indirect evidence includes the neutron emissions that have been detected in a regular and reproducible fashion using different types of detector. Direct evidence of piezonuclear reactions was obtained through a brand new spectroscopic technique, EDS, which, by comparing a statistically significant number of spots lying on the outer surface or the fracture faces of the granite specimen, and aiming directly on the only two iron ores present – Phengite and Biotite – was able to ascertain that iron, on average, was locally reduced by 25% and was replaced with atoms of aluminium (atomic number =13, half that of iron), silicon (atomic number =14) and magnesium (atomic number =12). Thus, the split was symmetrical in the case of aluminium, asymmetrical in the other instances. If these reactions can take place in a laboratory, where pressure and temperature conditions are much lower and, especially, the masses at play are much smaller than those found in the deep layers of the earth’s crust, they are bound to take place on a much larger scale within the latter, triggered by fracturing and crushing phenomena of seismic and tectonic origin. On the other hand, neutron fluxes up to a thousand times the natural background level may be detected before and during earthquakes, including medium magnitude ones. … … etc. … … etc. Link: http://www.jacques benveniste.org/coherence 15 ottobre 2013 Roma CIRPS.pdf — — — Hugh, I want to emphasize that I am not a fan of science fiction or pseudoscience, I just want to see what’s true around the world … If someone tells me that there are “chemical proofs” that confirm the piezonuclear transformation of biotite and phengite, then I can believe what he says. Instead if I was duped by false chemical tests, then this is another question … These are the terms of the problem, IMO. — — Then we have to read the following paper: “Comments on ‘Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s Crust’ by A. Carpinteri and A. Manuello”, by U. Bardi and G. Comoretto This was an article first published online: 7 Nov 2013 Abstract: >In ‘Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s Crust’ [Carpinteri and Manuello, Strain (2011) 47(2), 267], the authors claim that the composition of the Earth’s crust and of its atmosphere can be explained by hypothetical piezonuclear reactions.

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as a promising technique for the detection of these materials, yet concerns over the sensitivity of SERS spectra of dyes to chemical and instrumental variables (such as p H, choice of SERS substrates and/or aggregants, and excitation wavelength) have prevented its widespread use in analytical applications. Over the last few years, the development of several microanalytical approaches has considerably increased the chances of success in the identification of minute amounts of dyes by SERS.

Many sindonologists – not only Catholics, but also Jews, atheists, agnostics and Christians from different churches – are convinced of the authenticity of the Shroud that tradition reveres as burial cloth of Jesus. During the making of this special issue dedicated to the Holy Shroud, in view the exposition of April, we discussed, among others, with Giuseppe Canopies, physical ENEA Frascati (Rome), Emanuela Marinelli, Professor of Natural Sciences, and Domenico Repice, theologian (that for our Special realized some services that will be published in the coming weeks).

As I first asked on this blog [message dated September 8, 2015] we can read a comment connected to the interesting (and, perhaps, controversial…) book by William Meacham … Here what I wrote [September 8, 2015]: >Anyway, we can also try to consider what Prof. William Meacham wrote in the book: “The Rape of the Turin Shroud: How Christianity’s most precious relic was wrongly condemned, and violated” (= That book describes the two major fiascos to have afflicted the Turin Shroud in recent years: the C 14 dating of 1988 and the so called “restoration” of 2002…)… We can remember that previously unpublished photographs of the Shroud, taken by STURP using Quad Mosaic Photography (state of the art NASA technology) at the time, were published in the scientific journal “Chemistry Today” by Marino and Benford in 2008 in a paper entitled “Discrepancies in the Radiocarbon Dating Area of the Turin Shroud” and the fact that these “unpublished photographs of the Shroud” showed “anomalies in the radiocarbon sample area”… (see, for example, the paper by Mark Oxley under the address: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf and the paper by Barrie Schwortz: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf.). But the issue turned as another controversial proof… Then I think we have to solve an interesting “Four corner and center (of the Shroud) [UV Photographs]” problem! Well. How to exit from that conundrum? Now I ask: 1 Is it possible to photograph the sample from the so called “reserve” using ultraviolet fluorescence photography? 2 Is it possible to photograph (another time) the Shroud using ultraviolet fluorescence photography? 3 Is it possible to photograph the Shroud sample of Arizona using ultraviolet fluorescence photography? Is too difficult to obtain the permission to do all these simple works? In that case we still can think to start trying the checks after a positive answer only to the questions number 1 and 3… (and also this work it’s obviously feasible only with inherent permissions). But (probably) we still require another check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud (as main reference) because the controls, without the adequate reference (= the check on a sample coming from the main body of the Shroud), seems to be a bit inconclusive … or …Would we retain the old UV data (from the main body of the Shroud) as useful reference? In any case if Prof. Jull (of the University of Arizona) want be gentle with us and provide us the useful UV photograph for Arizona sample, that fact will be an interesting “great progress”. But this is not a great progress. So… I think we can try to reflect how to write a Plan to submit to the attention of Prof. Jull. Another thing: don’t like mass spectrometry and I prefer non destructive analyses… Is that preliminar work on that Arizona sample too difficult?

Fungal attacks on cellulose : the attacks by fungi can alter the cellulosic DP. I think it’s good to remember that fact when you want to indicate or suggest control of DP cellulose as a way of “dating of the Shroud” … Well. Here some words: Fungal cellobiohydrolases act at liquid solid interfaces. They have the ability to hydrolyze cellulose chains of a crystalline substrate because of their two domain structure, i.e. Cellulose binding domain and catalytic domain, and unique active site architecture… Cellobiohydrolases (CBH’s), attack cellulose from the non reducing ends of the cellulose polymers and yield cellobiose (a glucose dimer) as a majorproduct. Two types of CBH enzymes are known: cellobiohydrolase l (CBHI) which generates cellobiose exclusively, and cellobiohydrolase ll ~CBHII) which generates a mixture of cellobiose and glucose. CBH enzymes have not been found in cellulolytic, non filamentous bacteria, and thus appear to be limited to fungal and filamentous bacterial sources. — — Third question: I never try to polemizar with Jamon on what has instead written Agnoli … because I’ve already enough pockets full of false coins with what I jump out with the bad Google translations … — — — In any case I have found the following paper: Complexity of Spoken Versus Written Language for Machine Translation Nick Ruiz Conference: European Association of Machine Translation, At Dubrovnik, Croatia Abstract >When machine translation researchers participate in evaluation tasks, they typically design their primary submissions using ideas that are not genre specific.

The research includes three new tests, two chemical ones and one mechanical one. The first two were carried out with an FT IR system, so using infra red light, and the other using Raman spectroscopy. The third was a multi parametric mechanical test based on five different mechanical parameters linked to the voltage of the wire. The machine used to examine the Shroud’s fibres and test traction, allowed researchers to examine tiny fibres alongside about twenty samples of cloth dated between 3000 BC and 2000 AD. The new tests carried out in the University of Padua labs were carried out by a number of university professors from various Italian universities and agree that the Shroud dates back to the period when Jesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem. Final results show that the Shroud fibres examined produced the following dates, all of which are 95% certain and centuries away from the medieval dating obtained with Carbon 14 testing in 1988: the dates given to the Shroud after FT IR testing, is 300 BC ±400, 200 BC ±500 after Raman testing and 400 AD ±400 after multi parametric mechanical testing. The average of all three dates is 33 BC ±250 years. The book’s authors observed that the uncertainty of this date is less than the single uncertainties and the date is compatible with the historic date of Jesus’ death on the cross, which historians claim occurred in 30 AD. The tests were carried out using tiny fibres of material extracted from the Shroud by micro analyst Giovanni Riggi di Numana who passed away in 2008 but had participated in the1988 research project and gave the material to Fanti through the cultural institute Fondazione 3 M.

If you have taken an interest in that analytic field there is a study titled : DHM (Digital Holography Microscope) for imaging cells You can read that work under the address : http://iopscience.iop.org/1742 6596/61/1/260 Denis Gabor invented in 1948 a way to encode the phase as an intensity variation: the “hologram” [D.

The DHM implements digitally this powerful hologram … — — In any case I believe that Giulio Fanti is able to work in the field of Applied Mechanics in order to show something of interest about the linen fibrils. — — See also, for example, the study : Comparative Research of the Dynamic Young’s Module of Fibres by Więcek T, Konecki W. Published in : FIBRES & TEXTILES in Eastern Europe 2012; 20, 5(94): 36 40. Abstract: >This work presents an investigation of the dynamic Young’s modulus for fibres of varied thickness performed on an Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer (IMS) and Dynamic Mechanical Analyser (DMA). The IMS was designed and built by the authors and the DMA instrument was produced by TA Instrument Co (USA). Because different methods are applied for determination of the dynamic Young’s modulus it was necessary to perform a comparison analysis of the results received from the IMS and DMA, which are currently the most frequently used testers. This analysis shows that an IMS can be used when a DMA cannot be applied. The parameter set comprising the dynamic Young’s modulus for longitudinal vibrations can find application in material engineering in industry. The DMA method does not require the application of mathematical formulas to determine Young’s modulus but requires calibration as apposed to IMS. Measurements of the elasticity modulus were carried out under automatically stabilised climatic conditions. The compliance of the results obtained allows us to evaluate positively the performance of the Impulse Mechanical Spectrometer. Comparison of the results makes it possible to determine the measuring possibilities of the DMA and IMS and show the advantages of IMS over DMA. — — What is your opinion ?

I hope in your contributions. If we want to work with the preliminar experiments there are several things to do … For example : What is the difference about flash heating with respect repeated laser spots ? I remember that Ray Rogers (= RR) indicated the fact that Joan Rogers subjected linen to flash heating with lasers observing ablation without any color formation … The conclusion by RR was the following : intense rapid heating can not explain image formation and he add that the primary effect of any kind of radiation is heating; therefore the image color can not be a result of a flsh of any kind of radiation ! Instead Paolo Di Lazzaro and others researchers ( http://www.frascati.enea.it/fis/lac/excimer/sindone/Di%20 Lazzaro%20 %20deep%20ultraviolet%20radiation%20 %20 JIST.pdf ) have been able to use the laser on linen and they claim that linen fibrils treated in that manner are similar to those of the Shroud … and … then I ask : are we sure ? So, I think that investigating the matter using the AFM on treated linen fibrils (here the main linen treatments to control : Corona Discharge, excimer lasers, only Maillard pathway, etc.) will be the right way to work and in that manner we can hope to obtain the scientific truth. — — The use of AFM in Biology. The Atomic Force Microscope “images” individual molecules by monitoring the flexing of a micromachined cantilever as it scans over a surface with a sharp tip, contacting molecules deposited on the surface. The deflection of the AFM tip as it responds to sample topography is measured by reflected laser light and converted to a digital image map of molecule locations on the surface, plus their height profiles. This technique can be used in a number of ways and various biological applications have been developed. — — If the blood derived, for example, from a puncture caused by a needle used during sewing (after the Fire of 1532) then we can observe the differences in a more exact manner … — — In conclusion : All that we have to do is to apply the SPM techniques avoiding the great destructions (example = 14 C tests). — — Regards, Piero.","date":"2014-01-30","mins":"1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/28/moving-the-exclamation-point/","cat":"books","title":"Moving the Exclamation Point"},{"id":"comment-204253","author":"piero","post":"Personally I have found very interesting the solution against the old carbon dating for the Shroud (the results of 1988, coming from the 14 C test) = the numismatic dating of the Shroud!

Then the Shroud of Turin was contaminated by water … and the idea by Pam Moon is that the major watermarks were caused by water that was contaminated, this is a possible controversial idea (see : the Fire in 1532 and the water used)… So, we have to try to work in a safe area (previously chosen using the optical microscopy), avoiding the area of presumed contamination (from the humic and fulvic acid from the soil).

It is the basis of new applications in the field of Raman microprobing and improvements in Raman imaging techniques. The basic principle of confocal microscopy is reviewed and its extension to Raman spectroscopy is discussed in terms of improved depth resolution which results in better background discrimination. A new concept of Raman imaging is also presented which benefits from the confocal system and overcomes most of the limitations of direct imaging techniques. A dual fibre optic remote analysis scheme is described which has been developed to optimize the collection of the scattered light while minimizing the interference from the optical fibres. . — — — *** — — B.T.W. : Do you know the Polarized Raman Microspectroscopy?.","date":"2014-08-25","mins":"10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"id":"comment-146236","author":"piero","post":"Try to consider: Raman AFM and nano Raman (TERS)… See under the address: http://www.horiba.com/us/en/scientific/products/raman spectroscopy/raman afm and nano raman/configuration/ Configurations for Raman AFM and TERS imaging ….","date":"2014-08-26","mins":"5:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/looking-for-a-paper-by-mark-andersen/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Looking for a paper by Mark Andersen"},{"id":"comment-204057","author":"piero","post":"I have seen that finally you (and of course I am referring in particular to “daveb of wellington nz”!) have improved your comprehension of the matter (…but this happens after my many posts on the subject) … I’m happy for this late deepening of problems.

Now I have at hand the book (2007, Italian translation) of the previous Pope (= “Papa emeritus”) Benedictus XIV: “Jesus von Nazareth – Von der Taufe im Jordan bis zur Verklaerung” and then we can read the name “Harnack” as associated in a papal examination for a line of thought: … Adolf von Harnack (a German Lutheran theologian and prominent church historian), the liberal theology of XX century, the message of Christ and the purity (then: Harnack is not on the exact and rigorous line, if I am right …) … Instead Rudolf Schnackenburg (the other name indicated in your “short introduction”), following what wrote Pope Ratzinger, was “the right source” (= the “right name”… Sorry, here I become near … “ultrapapist”) and then we can think that “Ego Sum” (= Jesus Christ, the Son of God) was the “shape of energy” (emanated from “the Word Incarnate”) written on linen fibrils, perhaps in a mysterious “incarnate manner”… We have to use modern advanced controls, as you already know (from my own “SPM sermons”), I think that Giulio Fanti worked with Multi parametric mechanical measurements (= MPMM) just as a very interesting didactic work… In short: a good opportunity to improve our level of knowledges, but not yet “the last verdict” … and we are very far from that, as Hugh wrote [although, IMO, he exceeded in a pessimistic evaluation turning the data, as matter of fact, in a strange manner towards an incredible pro C14 1988 verdict! …]. — — — P. S. According to Benedict XVI, the dehellenization of Christianity has had three waves throughout history. In one of these (the second), Harnack was pushing for the simply return to the man Jesus and to his simple message, underneath the accretions of theology and, indeed, of hellenization: and thus it would be this simple message which would constitute, according to Harnack, the culmination of the religious development of humanity… — — Adolf von Harnack, in full Adolf Karl Gustav von Harnack (born May 7, 1851, Dorpat, Estonia, Russian Empire [now Tartus, Estonia]—died June 10, 1930, Berlin, Germany). >… Harnack’s most famous work, Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (1886–89; The History of Dogma), is a monument of liberal Christian historiography. >In this work, Harnack traced the origin and development of Christian dogma, which he understood to be the authoritative system of Christian doctrine that had formed by the 4th century AD. >His thesis was that Christian dogma in its conception and development is a work of the Hellenistic Greek spirit based on the Gospel of Jesus in the New Testament. >According to Harnack, the process begun at the Protestant Reformation—the overcoming of dogma by a recovery of the essence of the Gospel—should be completed, and the historical critical approach would achieve this. Harnack defended this position in his most popular book, Das Wesen des Christentums (1900; What Is Christianity?), which was the transcript of a course of lectures he had delivered at the University of Berlin. >Harnack’s other major works are Geschichte der altchristlichen Literatur bis Eusebius (1893–1904; The History of Ancient Christian Literature) and Die Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten (1902; The Mission and Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries). He was the chief editor of a critical edition of The Greek Christian Authors of the First Three Centuries (1891– ). >He also published numerous monographs on the New Testament and on the doctrines and institutions of the ancient church. >In all these works, Harnack tried to show how the Gospel of Jesus, which in his view has nothing in common with authoritarian ecclesiastical statutes and doctrines, became embodied in the doctrines of the church. He also expressed the conviction that, if Christianity is to retain its power in the modern world, it must be freed from any connection with the dogmas of God and Christ with which it became identified to survive in the Hellenistic world. … Link: http://www.britannica.com/E Bchecked/topic/255617/Adolf von Harnack Instead regarding Schnackenburg I have found an italian article by Nobile Marco, “Recensione: Rudolf Schnackenburg, La persona di Gesù Cristo nei quattro vangeli”, published in Antonianum, 71/2 (1996) p. 357.

S. Performs an act brave and sensible, which implies that the problem around the type of relationship between the Jesus of history and faith, is a false problem. When searching for the historical identity of Jesus Christ, you have access to only the gospels. Now, these are undoubtedly the projection of a truly historical entity and identity, however incontrovertible that basis is available only in the mediation offered by the long and complex tradition of primitive communities and, ultimately, its crystallization editorial work of the evangelists. When, then, we want to answer the question “Who was Jesus Christ?”, We as the only source of the four gospels, which make theologically significant historical event that occurred two thousand years ago with the appearance of the Rabbi of Nazareth, who, no reaction hermeneutics of the early church, it would be a historical phenomenon among others.

Your error happened because damaged linen sample are less recognizable with respect good linen samples. So, you created a confusion… In other words: Cotton and Linen are more inclined to be in some manner “more similar” when textile materials are more “mechanical aged” (…and then too degraded textile fibrils turn in unknown/unrecognizable material…). This is an obvious fact and now you have to answer about my remark… Have you understood what I have just written? For example: we can describe the effects of “cottonization” on physical mechanical properties of flax fibers… You cannot write against Fanti in a wrong manner. For example: observing the figure A.2, at p.352 (of the book by Fanti and Malfi : “Sindone primo secolo dopo Cristo!”, published by Segno Ed., 2014) there is a curious description … In fact a right cross section for linen is not hexagonal, but pentagonal… Perhpas flax has a cross section polygonal, nominally hexagonal but with just as many pentagons and heptagons… And then there is a fact (= hexagonal instead of pentagonal) where myself and you can easily discuss… Instead you wanted to attack Fanti on his attempt to show that medieval date about Holy Shroud (results obtained in 1988) was a wrong result (and this about the entire relic. Here I don’t discuss particular theories = Lind and Antonacci, Robert Rucker, etc. But IMO the Shroud is not a “nuclear esoteric painting”…)… In any case C14 is not some sort of philosopher’s stone. The Chosen People of C14 does not exists [and I am curious about the future date forecast by Rucker.

The dynamic response of the tip includes the complex tip–surface interactions due to the surface properties. We found that conventional tapping mode had a limitation in the accurate set point control on soft and high adhesion surfaces. This study employed the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based AFM microcantilever characterization method to estimate the surface property with more reliable control. The POD extracted the dominant empirical modes of the AFM microcantilever during tapping and scanning on the surface. Also the corresponding eigenvalues represented the significance of the empirical modes and the characteristic features of the nanoscale surface property. This experimental approach can offer a new insight on the novel application of nanoscale surface property estimation in dynamic AFM applications. … ….","date":"2015-01-13","mins":"12:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"id":"comment-183195","author":"piero","post":"I believe that … it would have been interesting if Fanti had contralateral parallel fibrils also from Sudarium of Oviedo ….","date":"2015-01-14","mins":"6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"id":"comment-182554","author":"piero","post":"Hugh, I don’t answered in time … [= “A stitch in time saves nine”!…] Sorry.

He is an Italian prof. Eng. And I have no academic titles… There’s no disguising the fact that he was able to obtain the samples by Riggi and this action permitted him to do the subsequent experiments (etc. …). When you wrote “p. 102” you should had better specify in this manner: “of the old book” (or “year 2013” [= first italian edition], or “Rizzoli edition”) because in the new book (Ed. Segno, Italy, january 2014), at p. 102 there are other informations … In any case it seems to me that we should think more about the fact that after Raymond N. Rogers (although there are doubts about the exact origin of the samples of Rogers) also prof. Giulio Fanti gave “the hammer blows” to dismantle the uncomfortable C14 dating of 1988 … Obviously this is not a final verdict against the “medieval date” for the Shroud, but it is already a big step towards the revision of the meaning of what has been achieved in 1988.

Peggie, Sergei G. Kazarian Abstract: >The potential of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FTIR) imaging for the characterisation of the chemical components of paint cross sections from old master paintings was investigated. Three cross sections were chosen to cover a variety of the analytical problems encountered in samples from paintings. The binding medium and degradation products in a green paint sample from a fifteenth century Florentine painting were imaged, as well as a thin layer within a cross section from a fifteenth century German painting, and multiple thin surface coatings on a painting of the 1760s by Peter Romney. The application of chemometric methods for further analysis of the large data set generated for each sample was also explored. The study demonstrated the advantages of ATR FTIR imaging, which allowed images to be obtained with high spatial resolution (ca. 3–4 μm) without the need to microtome the sample. The gain in sensitivity in detecting trace materials and the information derived from the location of these compounds in the sample was especially valuable, improving interpretation of the FTIR analysis and extending knowledge of the sample composition beyond that obtainable with other analytical techniques.

Urinary calculi formation is a complex process. Crystal retention is a key factor in urinary stone formation. That crystal retention can be caused by adhesion of crystals with the epithelial cells in the renal tubules. Kidney stones are aggregates of micron sized crystals that are commonly held together by an organic matrix (The most common inorganic crystalline components are: Calcium Oxalate monohydrate, Calcium Oxalate dihydrate, apatite, etc. Organic components include L cystine, Uric Acid and Urate salts …).

B.T.W.: Question: >What genes are related to primary hyperoxaluria? Answer: >Mutations in the AGXT and GRHPR genes cause primary hyperoxaluria. The breakdown and processing of certain sugars and protein building blocks (amino acids) produces a substance called glyoxylate. Normally, glyoxylate is converted to the amino acid glycine or to a compound called glycolate through the action of two enzymes, alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, respectively. Mutations in the AGXT or GRHPR gene cause a shortage of these enzymes, which prevents the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine or glycolate. As levels of glyoxylate build up, it is converted to oxalate. Oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate deposits, which can damage the kidneys and other organs.

Bruno Barberis said that “it would be desirable for a new campaign of direct studies on the Cloth” (to be able to collect more data in order to build a complete map of physical, chemical and biological characteristics) and that “need a laboratory for the Shroud” … But how much does such a laboratory dedicated to the Shroud?

I believe that we can try to measure : Distance between the eyes Width of the nose Distance between nose and mouth Height and Width of forehead and total face and then we can apply the comparison When we have to do with religious art representations (in comparison with the TS and Sudarium of Oviedo) we can use PCA (= Principal Component Analysis). The same can be performed on numismatic field (see also: prof. Giulio Fanti and his “numismatic dating”). As I wrote in the past, in the book (2014) by Giulio Fanti the Byzantine coins of Justinian II of 692 695 were reevaluated to better understand the influence of the Shroud image. Prof. Eng. G. Fanti in his own book used nose/eyes ratio… … and then Barrie Schwortz rejected “Freeman’s claims” and indicated the numismatic proof about the early coins (= byzantine coins, IMO). And, if I’m not mistaken, you have never considered this simple fact. — — Perhaps you can improve the discussion reading the paper: “Facial Feature Extraction and Principal Component Analysis for Face Detection in Color Images” Link: http://doras.dcu.ie/285/1/lncs 3212.pdf Abstract. >A hybrid technique based on facial feature extraction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA = PCA is a useful statistical technique. See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal component analysis ) is presented for frontal face detection in color images. Facial features such as eyes and mouth are automatically detected based on properties of the associated image regions, which are extracted by RSST color segmentation. While mouth feature points are identified using the redness property of regions, a simple search strategy relative to the position of the mouth is carried out to identify eye feature points from a set of regions. Priority is given to regions which signal high intensity variance, thereby allowing the most probable eye regions to be selected. On detecting a mouth and two eyes, a face verification step based on Eigenface theory is applied to a normalized search space in the image relative to the distance between the eye feature points. It’s useful the use of a facial feature extraction step prior to performing PCA analysis… — — — I have found another paper: “An application of caricature: How to improve the recognition of facial composites” Charlie Frowda, Vicki Bruceb, David Rossc, Alex Mc Intyrec & Peter J.

We investigate whether the recognition of facial composites, or pictures of criminal faces, could be similarly enhanced. In this study, participants first estimated the degree of caricature necessary to make composites most identifiable. Contrary to expectation, an anticaricature was found to be best, presumably as this tended to reduce the appearance of errors. In support of this explanation, more positive caricature estimates were assigned to morphed composites: representations that tend to contain less overall error. In addition, anticaricaturing reduced identification for morphed composites but enhanced identification for individual composites. Although such improvements were too small to be of value to law enforcement, a sizeable naming benefit was observed when presenting a range of caricature states, which appeared to capitalize on individual differences in the internal representation of familiar faces. — — — Here a question: Is the caricature a key to understand the strange Manoppello’s Veil? — — — Here (obviously) I have kept aside the controversial issue of the two ancient Roman coins (… that with the Sudarium of Oviedo have nothing to do !!!)..","date":"2015-02-12","mins":"8:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/12/the-sudarium-of-oviedo-as-evidence/","cat":"sudarium","title":"The Sudarium of Oviedo as Evidence?"},{"id":"comment-215368","author":"piero","post":"In principle I am opposed to dating with the C14 because this is a destructive method.
