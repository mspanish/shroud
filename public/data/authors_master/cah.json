{"researchers":[{"author":"cah","post":"Matt. Have only got pre-1350 date from Caroline Bynum's book but she is a highly regarded scholar so unlikely to be far out for the pieta. Agree with you re suffering as this is a book which concentrates on blood relics and therefore the examples will not necessarily be typical of the art of the period as a whole. Most of her examples are fifteenth century.I believe the crucifixion that Giotto painted at Assisi (?date but must be early fourteenth century) shows blood coming out of jesus's wounds.
