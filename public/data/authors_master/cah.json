{"researchers":[{"author":"cah","post":"\n\nMatt. Have only got pre-1350 date from Caroline Bynum's book but she is a highly regarded scholar so unlikely to be far out for the pieta. Agree with you re suffering as this is a book which concentrates on blood relics and therefore the examples will not necessarily be typical of the art of the period as a whole. Most of her examples are fifteenth century.I believe the crucifixion that Giotto painted at Assisi (?date but must be early fourteenth century) shows blood coming out of jesus's wounds. Try Google Images, Giotto crucifixion assisi.\n\n","date":"July 12, 2012 at 12:02 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-turin.html","title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey,\" part 1: \"Introduction\"\n"}]}
