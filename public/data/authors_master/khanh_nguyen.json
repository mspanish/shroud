Later that day i recieved what is the most amazing text reply i have and will ever recieve. One of his coworkers sons had also met jesus at the age of 4. The boys name was Adden, his mom had brought him into work later that day so my friend could show him the picture. Addens remarkable reply was…Hey! How do you have a picture of jesus?! Thinking he had somehow taken a photograph of him. My friend was so blown away he asked 3 more times until Adden told him to knock it off and that that picture was 100% Jesus. May the lord be with you all. Amen..","date":"2012-02-11","mins":"2:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
