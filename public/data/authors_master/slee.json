{"opinion":[{"id":"comment-9546","author":"slee","post":"Every idea so far ever proposed for how the image on cloth was formed won’t work. This includes manmade pictures, naturally formed images and imprints resulting from energy derived from a miracle. This is not a fact. It is a well informed opinion. As I see it, not one idea, even a scorch, has ever come close to being able to duplicate the complexities of the image. Rogers once wrote of a man who called him on the phone and “pointed out that when you cover a ‘daid boddie’ with a cloth, the flies come to the smell. ‘They poke their little noses through the cloth. And you know what flies leave – – – little black specks. Jest look at that image real close, and you will see that it is made up of a whole bunch of fly specks.’ By that time I was rolling on the floor, and I couldn’t answer him.” Would you waste as much time on fly speck guy as you do on the scorch guy? You should, it makes more sense. What about paint guy? Or sun bleach guy? Acid etch guy? Photo guy?Corona discharge guy? Worm hole guy? Dematerialization guy? Even Rogers, who was neither a fake guy nor a miracle guy? (With apologies to the gals). You’ve been played. As a thermochemist I can tell you the image is not the result of a scorch. De Lazzaro already explained why in this blog and to all of SSG. He is 100% right. Rogers also explained it in his FAQ and he is right. Scorch guy should put up or shut up. He must duplicate all of the complexities of the image. Until then, I say ignore him. Stop. Enough already.
