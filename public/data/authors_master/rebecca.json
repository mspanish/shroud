Jesus/Yeshua loves this! And also, when he finds pople who are humble enough to know about their dependance, He can give them (you) grace, love, gifts…because He knows it won´t make them proud, so its safe. I think He wants to give us so much more than He can, because of the danger of us becoming proud and self.sufficient..and turn away. But He longs for being able to pur out His love, that is the biggest satisfaction for him, as it is for the loving… So, be blessed: He loves you much and He has His pleasure in you!.","date":"2012-01-31","mins":"7:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-7735","author":"rebecca","post":"I Have jsut smelled it once, the night I described above.

I think he got his human appearance from his mother, since God doesnt have one…Jesus was no angel, he had human flesh…but was the word itself, from God, his son…that is the fascinating thing. Of course Akianes painting is not a photograph of God, since he has no human appearance, a body…but J had actually.

It was a man, but I think it was an angel…God sent him to comfort me, and to show me, that He saw the need that was hiding behind my silly wish…(I dind´nt even realize I was wishing…even less: praying) But on another occasion I was the angel. I bought a bouguet of tulips, I love them in the springtime…for myself…also a little: oh, nobody buys one, I got to get one myself. I jumped onto the tram, looked around to find a place, saw an old man, and heard a voice: Go sit down beside him.. I did, and the voice (a whisper inside me): give him the flowers! I hesitated for a second (What, my flowers?)…but then I gave it to him: They are for you….he: oh, what, why? I: God told me….and you know, we chatted a little and it was his birthday that day and he was so sad, because his children didn´t contact him end he was divorced… I can tell you I was glader giving away the flowers and seeing Gods care for this old man..then when I had them myself….","date":"2012-02-15","mins":"2:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-8273","author":"rebecca","post":"Maybe my experience will help you understand?
