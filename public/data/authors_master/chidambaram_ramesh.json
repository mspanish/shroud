{"art":[{"author":"chidambaram_ramesh","post":"Dr.Petrus Soons has been kind enough to send me a lenticular and 3-D image of the Shroud. My discussions with him through e-mails convince me that the 3-Dimensional image made by him is a photographic creation. Still, I must make a point here. There have been theories that the Shroud image itself formed out a quantum hologram (analogous to what Dr.Johnson described as a Man transparent to the environment)! My ensuing book “The Shroud of Turin: An Imprint of the Soul, Apparition, or Quantum Bio-Hologram” (proposed to be released in a fortnight) proposes that the Shroud image is indeed an imprint of the Quantum Self. It is not a mere theory. A plethora of concrete evidences has been drawn from the ancient alchemical science of palingenesis (that is resuscitating 3-D spectral plants from their ashes) and natural magic (showing house full of snake images in 3-D). The theory is simple but sound: Bio-matters of all organisms, even if consumed to ashes, retain the selfsame form and figure of the parent organism. The science behind such extraordinary quality is quantum holography. Each part of the body molecule or cell may encode information for the whole body .This fact has been successfully proven by various experiments in cloning by reconstructing the whole body from a single cell. These subtle holographic energy fields or patterns are the templates or blueprints for the physical body to guide its growth and development.\nDr. Benford, (also a Shroud researcher who discovered the French weave patch which misrepresented the Shroud in the C-14 dating results) in her paper, “Empirical Evidence Supporting Macro-Scale Quantum Holography in Non-Local Effects”, attributes the reason to quantum hologram as follows: \n‘One theory is that the test object contains a complete quantum hologram that can affect optical systems and, under the right conditions produce a holographic-like image. To make a hologram, two optical waves are needed: a reference wave and an object wave.  These two waves make a 3D holographic image by creating an interference pattern frozen in space-time.  Both waves are spatially and temporally coherent at the moment of creation, then separated. The object wave is directed towards the object and it experiences intensity changes and phase-shifts.  Normal 2D photographs record only the intensity changes of the object wave and not the phase-shifts.  However, when a reference wave is directed back towards the emitted object wave, an interference pattern is created, that records the phase-shifts of the object wave relating to the reference wave. These phase-shifts are what produce the apparent freezing in space-time of the object’s 3D image.’\nThus the quantum science will explain the centuries-old mysteries wrapping the Turin Shroud soon.\n\n","date":"October 15, 2010 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/10/10/troubled-by-the-new-shroud-of-turin-3d-web-site/","cat":"art","title":"Troubled by the New Shroud of Turin 3D Web Site"}],"dating":[{"author":"chidambaram_ramesh","post":"Further to the findings of Sue Benford and Joe Marino, Rogers made his studies on Vanillin (chemically 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) content of the samples used for C-14 tests. Lignin is a chemical compound present in the flax plants used to make linen cloths. One of the major products obtained from the breakdown of lignin is vanillin. As linen ages, the vanillin content diminishes and eventually becomes untraceable in the course of time. Thus, by measuring the amount of vanillin remaining on the cloth, one might be able to estimate the age of the cloth. Rogers believed that vanillin was detectable in the sample taken for radiocarbon testing. Thus, it must date from medieval times. He believed that vanillin was also present in the ‘Holland cloth’ used to back the Shroud. However, he could not detect it in material taken from the rest of the Shroud.\nHad the findings of the C-14 test that the Shroud belongs to the 13th or 14 century been correct, it should have retained about 37% of its vanillin, reasoned Roger.  Not only does this verify that the carbon 14 sample is chemically different from the rest of Shroud, it proves that the carbon 14 sample contains much newer material. Further, examining the loss of the chemical vanillin in the Shroud, Rogers estimated that it is between 1,300 and 3,000 years old!\n\n","date":"January 19, 2011 at 9:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/19/joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"}],"image":[{"author":"chidambaram_ramesh","post":"Though the intensity-distance correlation demonstrated by the Shroud image could not be explained by current science, it conforms to the idea that it can be a holographic imprint. As explained in the last two chapters of my book “The Shroud of Turin: An Imprint of the Soul, Apparition or Quantum Bio-Hologram”, a hologram reconstructs two images – one real (or, pseudoscopic) and the other virtual (or, orthoscopic). Both are exact replicas of the object but for their manifestation. The virtual image is produced at the same position as the object and has the same appearance of depth and the parallax as the original 3D object. The virtual image appears as if the observer is viewing the original object.\nThe real image is also formed at the same distance from the hologram, but in front of it.  In the real image, however, the object depth is inverted. It can be compared to looking at the mould of a sculpted object or the inside of a mask, i.e., the observer has the sensation of looking straight through the back surface and  seeing the front surface image from the inside-out (with convex shapes becoming concave). For example, the image of a convex chess piece will appear as concave or reversed contour. Similarly, a 3D brick lying on the ground would look like a brick sized hole sunk into the ground.  Such an inside out image is called ‘pseudoscopic image’ and this inquisitive effect is called ‘pseudoscopy’ or depth-reversal. This is due to the fact that the corresponding points on the two images (virtual and real) are located at the same distances from the hologram.  Pseudoscopy is a notable feature of holograms and is an interesting phenomenon of optical phase conjugation due to 180° phase change . Though it is difficult to see this real image with an unaided eye, if one places a photographic plate, or frosted glass, in the plane where the real image is formed, one can obtain its two-dimensional projection (imprinted on the linen cloth in the case Shroud).\nAnother interesting and remarkable characteristic of the pseudoscopic image is that a photographic contact copy of a hologram does not yield a negative image, but another positive image. The basic theory is that a negative of a negative is a positive. Leith and Upatnieks point out:\nThe hologram, which is the first recording on film, ordinarily is considered to be the negative. Yet the reconstruction gives a positive image. If a contact print if made of this, again a positive reconstruction is obtained. It is impossible to obtain a negative reconstruction’. (Leith, 1964)\nThus the twin problems of the Shroud image – photographic negativity as well as image reversal (side reversal) could be well explained with the help of the holographic model of image reconstruction. Assuming that the quantum self manifested from the corpus inside the Shroud was a pseudoscopic (real) image, and that its two-dimensional projection was imprinted on the Shroud, would settle almost all the conundrums shrouding the image.\nThe body image penetrates into the cloth to a depth of two or three fibres only (in the order of 1/100th of hair thickness) and there is no cementation among the fibrils. Beneath them, the fibres remain undisturbed.  Thus the radiation that acted on the Shroud material should have been low-intensity and volumetric, representing the exact geometry of the body of the crucified man. As stated by Roger, any hypothetical conversion of entre body-matter into energy (following E = mc2 formula) would have proved hazardous as such energy release would have been in the order of 200-300 megatons of TNT. \nConcerning the holographic model, science has proved that any kind of physical field, whether acoustic, electromagnetic, even perhaps gravitational, can create a hologram (volumetric representation of the exact geometry of the body), because what is needed is ‘wave coherence’ and ‘phase-conjugate-adaptive resonance’, which are independent of other factors like intensity or nature (wave kind). Thus, it is convenient for us to assume radiation of any kind and of any intensity under the quantum holographic model, till the exact kind and intensity of the radiation forming the bio-holographic matrix is discovered.\nThe double-superficiality of the image, as discovered by Professors Guilo Fanti and Roberto Maggiolo, could also be explained by this holographic flux model. The second image contains the face image (though fainter) on the reverse side of the Shroud.\nUnder the quantum bio-holographic model, the manifestation of the 3-dimensional image of the host is hypothesized to be due to ‘phase-conjugation-adaptive-resonance’ and no outside source of light or radiation is considered. Thus, the model is capable of explaining the non-directionality of the Shroud image. \nOptimal Viewing Distance: \nMinute observers could note that there is an optimal viewing distance to see the Shroud image, and as once approaches it very closely, it disappears! After the fire in 1997, Aldo Guerreschi, a professional photographer in Turin, was asked to photo-document the examination of the Shroud. He narrates his observations;\n“Moving around that table from a certain angle I saw this image so faded as if to practically disappear, while from others it seemed as if the figure were almost outside the sheet; it was, I repeat, an incredible emotion…. I approached the face placing my camera at a distance of about 20 – 30 cm, aimed the camera at the face and saw…nothing in the viewfinder; … I could only see it as I moved away from it.” (Guerreschi) \nLike him, Dr.Petrus Soons (who has proposed that the Shroud image contains holographic information), observes that the image appears more distinct at a distance and fades when viewed at certain angles, particularly as one comes closer to the Shroud. “The image is faint, without well-defined boundaries so that the eye has no point of reference and it appears simply as variation of the background density.” Peter M. Schumacher says, “It is difficult to orient oneself relating to the image, if the observer is in close proximity to the cloth.”\nParallax and viewing at an angle are the consistent features of hologram. While looking at the steroemetric holographic displays, one can move one’s head and can observe the continually changing the image aspect with the viewing angle.  These effects can readily be experienced in lenticular displays, anaglyphs and stereograms. \nHalf-tone effect and the Dehydration of linen\nThe formation of the image on the Shroud is a unique “pixel-like” phenomenon. Where the image appears darker, it is not due to more or darker substances, it is because of a greater number of pixels. Thus the pixel density decides the colour intensity in the Shroud, as can be seen in a newspaper photograph. The size of the pixels that make up the image is one tenth the width of a human hair. Some skeptics are keen to argue that this tonality or pixel effect is due to the reflection of light and hence the Shroud image is a photograph. But the fact is different.\nThe hologram stores the information of the object in the form of a wave front. Therefore, every point of the object has an influence on every pixel of the hologram. The x, y position of each ‘holographic pixel’ corresponds to the x, y position of each object point. To put it the other way around, each pixel of the hologram contributes to each point of the 3D object. The depth information for each image point is also encrypted as the overall size of the single pixel interference pattern; an image-point which reconstructs as being deep within the hologram will have a ‘pixel’ with a large width and with long-radius slightly-curved fringes, while a shallow point will have a tiny ‘pixel’ and small-radius fringes.\nThis is what happened in the case of Shroud image. Moran, in his paper, says that pixels vary in length along the fibrils from about 200 to 1000 microns (i.e. from 0.2 to 1mm).  The intensity of the yellow colour is very uniform from one pixel to another, so that the image is formed by the closeness of the spacing of the pixels (similar to formation of an image in a half-tone reproduction where it is the spacing of uniform black print dots that form the print image and not a variation in the blackness of the individual dots themselves. (Power, 2003)\nIn an article “Optically Terminated Image Pixels Observed on Frei 1978 Samples”, Kelvin Moran describes the image pixels: \n‘The individual image pixels have very sharp boundaries at their ends across the 15-micron diameter of the fibres.  When seen at a magnification of 200 power, these pixels show uniformly darkened area over the natural color of the non-imaged fibre. At the boundary between the image pixel and the clear fibre, there is a sharp change.  There is no gradual edge as expected from a shadow mask or external light source…The fact that the pixels don’t fluoresce suggests that the conversion to their now brittle dehydrated state occurred instantly and completely so no partial products remain to be activated by the ultraviolet light. This suggests a quantum event where a finite amount of energy transferred abruptly.’ (Moran, 1999)\nThis holographic pixel concept is even used for holographic image enlargement by repeating small pixels of a first hologram over large areas to form an expanded version of the first hologram. \n‘Mechanically Transparent’ Man is a Hologram!\nJackson proposed that “the body of the Man in the Shroud became mechanically transparent to its physical surroundings; it emitted radiation from all points within and on the surface of the body.  This radiation interacted with the cloth as it fell into the mechanically transparent body, thereby forming the body image on the Shroud.” (Jackson 1977, 1984, 1990)\nAnother point that strengthens this idea is that the body image is almost completely coherent with a vertical projection of the corresponding human body as if the Shroud was draped naturally over a body shape lying in the supine position.\nPhysicist Thaddeus Trenn also thinks that, “due to a radiation event, the body of the man became mechanically transparent to the physical surroundings, and that a stimulus was generated that recorded the passage of the cloth through the body region and onto the cloth as an image.”(Parker)\nLinking the X-ray effect noted by US chemist Dr. Giles Cart, Dr. Trenn opines that it is only a secondary effect to the primary phenomenon of dematerialization of the body. If the holographic manifestation of the quantum self is assumed to be behind the Shroud image, then Jackson’s theory of a man ‘mechanically transparent to the environment’ can be explained easily and justifiably.\n\n","date":"January 28, 2011 at 1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/28/evidence-of-jesus-resurrection-in-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Evidence of Jesus’ Resurrection in the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"chidambaram_ramesh","post":"The mystery wrapping the Holy shroud is multi-dimensional. As debated, it can be either man-made or natural. Any theory which attempts to untie the knots should invariably explain all the unique characteristics hitherto identified by scientists like photographic negativity, 3-dimensional encryption of light intensity, anatomical exactitude etc. If the hands of a faker are assumed, then such theories should unequivocally explain how  could the faker have envisioned the idea of ‘negative image’ or a painting with reverse shade, and executed it as back as in the 14th century? How could he have incorporated the image intensity versus distance correlation into the Shroud image? How could he have ensured that the impression of the image did not penetrate a depth less than 1/100th of a hair?   How could he have been able to bring in the X-ray effect amazingly in the case of hands, where one could easily observe metacarpal bones and phalange bones of each finger?  What could have made the pollens grains, endemic to Palestine region, appear on the Shroud? Who could have brought the samples of limestone on the Shroud from Jerusalem? And, as Stevenson commented, if the Shroud was a creation of the Middle Ages, then its forger must have ordered the mites to go with it!\n    The painting theory of McCrone may be, as he believes, able to prove that the bloodstains on the Shroud do not relate to human or that they are not blood at all. But he should not close his eyes to other perspectives of the problem. It requires a holistic view, comprehensive analysis and a complete package of solutions. Any attempt to pick out a single characteristics and to solve it without considering the connected facts will not be good. It is like the description of an elephant by four blind men. One grasps the trunk and concludes it is a snake. Another explores one of the elephant’s legs and describes it as a tree. Third finds the elephant’s tail and announces it is a rope. And the fourth blind man, after discovering the elephant’s side, concludes that it is, after all, a wall!\n\n","date":"February 6, 2011 at 1:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/06/thoughts-for-a-sunday-morning-if-i-am-right-then-i-am-right/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts for a Sunday Morning: “If I am right, then . . .

Dr.Marina Shaduri and her colleague George T.Shitshinadze (Gogi) have experimentally demonstrated that it is possible to study shapes and structural details of most affected organs or tissues of organisms using only some distal parts of a living body as the source of information. They found, when fingertips are placed in the electromagnetic field of high frequency, their radiation displays exact images (holograms) of the body’s pathological structures.\nBased on experimental and clinical data, they suggest that physical waves of different types (mechanical, electromagnetic, magnetic etc) comprise dynamic web-like structure, which is organized like a multilevel (multiplex) holographic grating with bounded space of a living body.  Such a fragile and highly sensitive fluctuating (“flowing”) medium is capable of altering its whole organization according to the structure of its misbalanced parts. Thus, previously unknown functional mechanism, which has been defined as “Holo-Informational System” serves not only as a system-integrating factor, but also as a functional system that might affect some particle-associated process within the entire body.
