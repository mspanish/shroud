A friend of mine lost her dear son a year ago; another 19 year old child who was dedicated and devoted to God. But she misses him with all her heart. When Corrie Ten Boom was in the concentration camp during WWII with her sister Betsy; she miraculously was spared but Betsy died there because she was frail. And from what Corrie says of her sister, Betsy was a very gentle soul with an angelic spirit. Like Enoch in the Old Testament, who was so GOOD that he just walked right into heaven without dying… maybe that is why the sweetest and the most precious go to God a little earlier than the rest of us. And that is why we miss them all the more, because such a gift is hard to find on this earth. But the LOVE never stops and never fails! That is what is encouraging about Colton’s book: the Love goes on. Love is the only thing we can take with us beyond this life. Your son is praying for you, and loving you, even now..","date":"2012-11-13","mins":"9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
