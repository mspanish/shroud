I am the first to confess the book is NOT an easy read and would need some rewriting to make it more commercially viable. For this and other reasons I unwittingly throw out ‘teasers’. Then there is the matter of ‘what’ inspired me to write the book. The book is a first hand, factual account of an event that involved the supernatural and what I later came to recognize as cosmology. The event redefines the word bizarre but did capture the interest of 2 Jesuit priests and an associate of one of theirs who specialized in religious phenomena..","date":"2013-12-13","mins":"9:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/12/mystery-as-proof/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Mystery as Proof"},{"id":"comment-58820","author":"michael_jude","post":"Even with the accompanying accoutrement of nails in the hand, coins over the eyes, radiation, carbon dating, recitation and interpretation of biblical verses/passages and whatever else can be found in the ‘kitchen sink’ of sindonology, trying to determine how the image was made, where it originated from by focusing solely on the image alone is akin to trying to explain how a car moves by only explaining what a spark plug is.","date":"2013-12-13","mins":"9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/12/mystery-as-proof/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Mystery as Proof"},{"id":"comment-58821","author":"michael_jude","post":"Jesus once said ” i have many more things to tell you but you cannot bear to hear them now.","date":"2013-12-13","mins":"9:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/12/mystery-as-proof/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Mystery as Proof"},{"id":"comment-208303","author":"michael_jude","post":"About 2 years ago I found this blog at which time I made my initial statement saying that I understand how the image was formed. I come back to it from time to time to see if anyone else has even alluded to certain aspects of the shroud necessary to understanding it. I’ve yet to see even one. The closest anyone has come is the theory held by Isabel Piczek. However, through no fault of her own it is a very far cry from being a total explanation. In fact, just a few months ago I inadvertently found her theory one day on line and was pretty much taken aback by what she said. If you read what she said and what I wrote in my book, Thirteenth Apostle: The Coming Transubstantiation 14 years BEFORE she even developed an interest in the Shroud it would raise some eyebrows. I am NOT saying that she knowingly or unknowingly took what I wrote and expounded on it in her own way but it would be hard NOT to at least entertain the idea. Except for the placement of one or two words, literally, our explanations, at first blush, are identical. However this placement of words makes a difference that is immeasurable………………[contact information removed].","date":"2015-08-15","mins":"5:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/15/from-out-of-the-strong-came-forth-the-sweet/","cat":"image_theory","title":"From out of the strong came forth the sweet?"},{"id":"comment-58954","author":"michael_jude","post":"Funny you should mention Tielhard.

This time he said, again, words to the effect, he pretty much will not read it as we are not coming from the same place. Not a problem with me. Did he read something that will finally put the Shroud mystery to rest? I claim to understand the mechanism involved and all of its ramifications and all that it entails. For me as I’ve written on here the Shroud of Turin is not something I knowingly took an interest in. Given my level of education and erudition, actually disqualifies me from such a venture. The Shroud was one of MANY subjects in my book that came to my attention but a relatively short time before and found it way into the book resting comfortably within a body of knowledge I fortunately acquired. To this day it still remains a mystery to me why I was involved.

I decided to produce and market a brochure. Because certain parts of the book are, admittedly, not an ‘easy read’, I wanted to take one of the many many topics of the book and write about/explain it in simpler terms. I decided upon the Shroud of Turin for its high profile even among people who are not interested in religion, philosophy, etc. I also wanted the context and syntax of the brochure to be such that it mimicked the ‘ here it is, read it and just believe it without thought’ style of so many organized religions. I convinced one book store to stock it and it sold there for about a year when I decided to pull it off the shelf. I had an opportunity to speak with the owner of the chain of stores. He told me the brochure had great potential and suggested I find a distributor for it. I tried to find a distributor but could not seem to cut through all of the red tape necessary for me to contact them vis a vis.

For in the premonition His physical wounds via His crucifixion seemed to be emphasized, accentuated, set apart from the rest of his physical form as though they were being in a third dimension holographic style”. In December 2013 I contacted the person who is considered to be the innovator of using 3 D holograms for such a purpose and asked when he first initiated the process. When he wrote back saying the year was 2004 I wrote him again asking if the idea of doing so had previously existed.
