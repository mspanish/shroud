I am a physician (gastroenterologist) so no particular expertise regarding the shroud, but of course familiarity with science. I lean toward the shroud being authentic, but I applaud Colin’s probing endeavors and research and think it serves a valuable purpose.\nThat being said, I don’t yet buy that the creases he points out are “cooked in.” I see lots of creases on the Enrie and Durante images on Shroud Scope. Many of these are far from image areas and should be very different from the neck and head creases Colin points out as they should not be “cooked in”. (It would be interesting to see the enhanced images in these areas.)  Also, I find it interesting that the neck crease crosses the lower edge of the non-image area lateral to the face, which is,according to Colin, an area of non-contact with the bas-relief. I find it hard to believe a crease could be “cooked in” in this location under Colin’s scenario.\nJust some thoughts…\n\n","date":"March 23, 2014 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/23/baked-in-creases-really/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Baked-In Creases.

It actually supports my point which is not that the crease extends lateral to the hair, but extends across the “gap” between the face and hair–the “dark area” where there should be little to no contact with the linen in the scorching scenario.\n\n","date":"March 24, 2014 at 2:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/23/baked-in-creases-really/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Baked-In Creases.

(Though I lean fairly strongly toward authenticity.) I do think the chin crease is the most important for your argument, though it doesn’t falsify the scorch hypothesis if it isn’t “baked-in”. I look forward to what you have to say regarding the crease crossing the “gap” between the face image and the hair.\n\n","date":"March 26, 2014 at 7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/25/pictures-to-consider-for-the-posting-baked-in-creases-really/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Pictures to Consider for the Posting: “Baked-In Creases. Really?”"},{"author":"steve_hammond","post":"Thanks, Mike,\nI’ll see if I can get something together this weekend and get it to Dan.\n\n","date":"March 26, 2014 at 8:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/25/pictures-to-consider-for-the-posting-baked-in-creases-really/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Pictures to Consider for the Posting: “Baked-In Creases. Really?”"},{"author":"steve_hammond","post":"\nMike M :\n I will credit Colin though that at least he is listening, (and I hope willing to change his mind when the evidence leads him in the opposite way).\n\n I agree, Mike. Looking at his blog, there are some very interesting things that haven’t been fully explored yet. Most interesting to me is the nature of the “flagrum” scourge marks…being raised on 3D imaging and the “blood” marks associated with them.
