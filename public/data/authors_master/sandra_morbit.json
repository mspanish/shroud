Being a Catholic who was married to a Baptist, I could relate to the views of a Baptist, as well as the views of a Catholic. I believe that Colton actually did see heaven and his comments were as the bible explains. I think God allows such miracles to give the world proof that heaven is for real and who better to reveal heaven to than a child whose innocence makes it even more of a miracle; if told by a preacher it would not be as miraculous because he knows the bible an innocent child speaks only of what he experienced as seen through a child’s eyes. In a world who is in war, drugs surrounding our youth and unemployment at an all time high, I think the world could use a miracle, many miracles especially from the innocence of a child. And the bible truly says we must become like children to enter the gates of heaven..","date":"2011-07-08","mins":"7:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/24/more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
