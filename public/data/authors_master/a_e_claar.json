{"art":[{"author":"a_e_claar","post":"I just read ” Heaven is Real”, the first book I have read in many years. I did not want to stop when it was time to go to bed. I finished it the next day, reading instead of watching my favorite past time, “Football”. The book was fabulous, Colton had to have seen what he said he saw to be so emphatic about Jesus loving the little children. I have always tried to be a Christian but failed to meet the test several times. This book is strong evidence that Heaven,  God and Jesus does exist.","date":"October 30, 2011 at 7:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/24/more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
