{"misc":[{"id":"comment-160","author":"aorphia","post":"In the bible it states that Jesus Christ had hair like wool and skin like ash. The only people in this world that have hair like wool and skin like ash is the black race. Being jewish is not a race, rather it is a religion. There were twelve (12) jewish tribes and one of those tribes was of the black race. When a black persons skin becomes real dry in that area, it leave the appearence and color of ash, especially if the were to scratch that area. What I am getting at in all of this is, perhaps everyone involved in the scientific research of Jesus Christ, may not have been doing there scientific research with the idea that Jesus Christ, may have well been a black man. And, that the crusifiction of Jesus Christ may have been because, those who ultimately decided his crusifiction were racist. Keep in mind, twelve (12) jewish tribes and only one of those tribes were of the black race. Yes, there were racist back in those days..","date":"2008-10-07","mins":"7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/10/04/religulous-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Religulous and the Shroud ofÂ Turin"}]}
