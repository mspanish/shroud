{"image":[{"author":"acilius","post":"Well, I suppose the general point is that the likelier the Shroud of Turin is to be the burial cloth of the man whose crucifixion is described in the Gospels, the closer it is to enabling us to formulate an empirically falsifiable hypothesis that would include the proposition that Jesus rose from the dead.  Formulating an empirically falsifiable hypothesis is the first step towards the development of scientific understanding.  An hypothesis that survives enough attempts at falsification can grow into knowledge.  So, if you are hoping for science to show that Jesus rose from the dead, the recent test results regarding the shroud are exciting.  However, falsifiable hypotheses are quite often falsified. If the results do hold up, therefore, and the shroud is shown to be that of a man who was crucified in Jerusalem in the first half of the first century in the manner described in the Gospels, then sooner or later an examination of some kind may lead to evidence either that Jesus rose from the dead or that he did not.  Evidence that Jesus did not rise from the dead would be evidence against everything in the Gospels.  Don’t take it from me that the Gospel does not hold together if Jesus did not rise from the dead.  As you may recall, Saint Paul had something to say about that in the fifteenth chapter of the first letter to the church in Corinth.  If you don’t acknowledge Saint Paul as an authority, then reading the comments on a blog about the Shroud of Turin is a very strange hobby for you to have.  So I think we can all agree that if the results hold up there will be a great deal at stake in future examinations of the Shroud of Turin.","date":"August 17, 2015 at 9:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/14/lightening-striking-the-other-crucified-person-in-his-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Lightening Striking the Other Crucified Person in His Shroud"}]}
