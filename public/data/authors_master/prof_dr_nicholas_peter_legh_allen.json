Please note that all blood “flows” on the shroud contain acute angled kinks isomewhere along their supposed flow. This is caused by an artiistic flick of the wrist during painting. Also, all blood flows, regardless of where they supposedly emanate from, exhibit the same thickness and consistency. \nPlease take me off your site and refrain from misquoting me as this just confuses your reader further.\nProf Dr NPL Allen\n\n","date":"April 23, 2014 at 9:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/21/the-pig-experiment-was-not-barries-experiment/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The pig experiment was not Barrie’s experiment"}]}
