Among the textile fragments excavated at Masada were the remains of pieces of fabric with L-shaped cloth markings affixed to them.

If I knew of the Shroud and stumbled across the HPM and saw the L shaped holes, the odd weave, the corpse positioning, I too would connect it to the Shroud.In my opinion, Wilson and now OK have made an honest mistake. They also are overstating the parallels and are not being open to the strong counter arguments.At best the HPM should be put aside as disputed ‘evidence’ and only brought out again if some other corroborating evidence (for or against) is found.","date":"June 25, 2014 at 4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"OK, yes I understand your reasoning.

Could the HPM be influenced by the Shroud. Yes, I see that as a possibility. Could the parallels be coincidence mixed with our reading the Shroud into them? Yes, also a possibility.I have the sense that we are reading more into the art than the artist had ability to layer in himself. That’s just my opinion.If the evidence was so conclusive, we wouldn’t be having this debate, would we?What this debate doesn’t need is either side patronizing the other.

Adding to the challenge is the fact that there are already dozens of Shroud-themed projects/scripts out there. I know because a major Hollywood producer told me this 12 years ago when I was pitching him one I’d found. The pitch behind the Shroud Affair feels, in my opinion, too soft — and no Hollywood producer is going to make a film with the goal of creating a scientific opportunity. It’s about making a profit, pure and simple.As a Shroudie, I hate to rain on the parade here. But I’m only giving my opinion based on my own experience and knowledge of Hollywood — especially pitching.All that being said, there is a very tantalizing high-concept premise in the Shroud pitch that I believe a Hollywood producer might be interested in: the one million dollars to whoever can replicate the Shroud! This reminds me of James Randi’s famous million-dollar offer to anyone who could reproduce a paranormal event (under scientific observation). He never had to pay out – though many tried.Pitch the Shroud Challenge, a reality TV series. Get an insurance firm to cover the million (I don’t think anyone will get to claim it!). Then invite challengers to submit (online) their proposed method for replicating the Shroud. Select the best (and a few of the really goofball ones) and film their efforts for the series.

On that subject, there are 2 things that make me think like this:  1- At that time (3th or 4th century A.D.) in Rome, the most common figure of God was a man with long hair and long beard (like Zeus and other great divine figures), so it is highly probable that those pagan depictions of God have been used to represent Christ at a time when no one knew what he looked like (which make me think the Shroud was still well hidden somewhere at that time).  And 2- There is not one of these bearded Christ frescos that show as many points of congruence as we found in most Pantocrator-like icons, which make me think the first depictions (the Roman frescos) were not based on the image we see on the Shroud, while it is the contrary for the Pantocrator-like icons.Perhaps the Romans portrayed Jesus with a beard because, as the occupiers of Judea, they knew very well what Jewish men, especially its zealots, rabbis and mystics, looked like.","date":"February 8, 2014 at 10:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/06/touching-on-the-byzantine-legend-that-jesus-had-a-shorter-leg-and-therefore-was-lame/","cat":"art","title":"Touching on the Byzantine legend that Jesus had a shorter leg and therefore was lame"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Just read this comment buried among Max’s blizzard.

Everything we can see (that we all agree that we see) on that image is organic based: blood, human flesh, hair. However the image was formed (gases, light, heat) it appears to be connected to the body itself. How then did the coins, which are metal and not organic, leave an image? If anything they should have blocked image formation over the eyes or wherever they fell.Flowers…maybe…as they are organic might have allowed for image transfer.But here’s another question, as long as we are musing. I think of how microwave radiation can cook meat yet leave the paper towel covering it unaltered. Could some form of exterior light or radiation discharge have altered the body inside the linen, leaving the image without affecting the linen itself.

Some of it made me reflect again on the idea of rain being involved. One of the reasons I’d felt rain wasn’t a good theory is because it would have created mud at the foot of the cross and this mess would likely have found its way onto the body and Shroud. But if it was mostly rocky, as you point out, this is another matter.The rain may have been short-lived, just enough to ‘wash’ the body to some degree (the rain’s angle, intensity and position of the body relative to it are the unknown variables). It dries up again by the time Jesus is removed from the cross.I don’t think your sweat-wash idea works. I have lived in very humid countries and played sports in them. I would sweat like crazy. But the sweat never acted the same as a ‘wash’. If it anything it merely further cakes any dirt on your body. I also wonder if a severely dehydrated body, as Jesus’ surely was, would have been able to produce that much sweat anyway.By the way, I’m not convinced the reference to a storm is a literary device. We accept so many other details of the Gospel Passion accounts as mostly factual. The detail about there being an earthquake is considered a possible fact by some (including the damage to the veil in the Temple), so I don’t see why the storm detail couldn’t be factual as well.Perhaps I should apply Occam’s Razor to my rain theory? :)","date":"July 31, 2013 at 9:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/28/guest-posting-challenging-frederick-zugibe-on-washing-of-the-body/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Guest Posting: Challenging Frederick Zugibe on Washing of the Body"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"You raise a good point about the ground and removal of the body. Was the body lain on the ground itself, or perhaps another cloth different than the shroud (the already soiled tunic from the march to Golgotha), or a piece of wood?

Certainly there’s a huge disconnect between the message and life of Jesus and the impact so-called Christian nations have left on the Earth. Gandhi said it well, “‘I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.’By finding alternative narratives for Jesus, those with an axe to grind against European Christianity can lay claim to Jesus as their founder too. They can boast that the Jesus they follow is unsullied by Western thought.It is unfortunate that non-Europeans feel this aversion to European Christianity, but given the history of the Holy Roman Empire and beyond, I can sympathize with the sentiment.","date":"August 31, 2015 at 12:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

If the rain occurs while he is on the cross, this too may wash away topical blood. How does blood flow on wet skin vs dry? Is this why we have dirt on the toes (where even rain water would have trouble washing away the caked in dirt) but less so on the nose and knees where rainwater could have more effect? If Jesus was removed from the cross wet, some of the topical blood may have wiped itself onto the transport linen (not the Shroud). When the body is then placed on the dry burial linen moist wounds may have continued to ooze blood.

I know doctors take oaths and they still botch it up.And even if further C-14 testing was permitted, are we so certain that even with more rigorous protocols that the results would be any more accurate? This cloth is unlike any other we’ve seen. Did the image formation process itself (whether it occurred by some bio-process 2000 years ago, or by a yet unknown medieval process) affect the cloth and its carbon reading? Are there other infusion elements (aside from threading) that may skew the results?Even if new C-14 data pointed to a 40 AD year date I wouldn’t be using that as my smoking gun. C-14 is only one cog in the wheel.","date":"October 18, 2013 at 9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/18/again-joe-marino-sue-benford-and-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again:  Joe Marino, Sue Benford and the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"I keep reading from Colin how the C-14 scientists have been dragged through the mud and borderline slanderous accusations thrown at them.

Some basic insights into body form, some facial features, a few blood lines – that’s about it. To suggest that artists prior to our modern time were able to discern dumbbell scourge marks seems a stretch. They would have been dealing with ‘the big picture’ and not the details we enjoy today with our technology. I also suspect the Shroud spent much time being seen by very few people at all — hidden away, or seen only by the residents of select towns where it was displayed by its owner at the time.I sit on the authentic side of the debate but I’m left asking, when presented with all crypto-images, why is there not one example of an artist portraying the Shroud clearly. Even the Pray Manuscript, which is by far the most intriguing, is not definitive.Now there may have been such pieces of art but they have been lost, or remain to be found.

As to your question at the end. I do see the scaling up as a problem because, though it is likely doable (given time and resources I’m confident you could achieve it), it wasn’t necessary. By that I mean the TS – if a scorch – is one of amazing precision. To replicate it today has proven quite a task. There was no need for a medieval artisan to be that precise. If he could affect a reasonable facsimile of a sweat imprint, as per your theory, then he had it made in the shade. I can’t imagine that artisan making upteen attempts, ensuring the scorch was at the surface level of the threads. No one had microscopes back then, who would have been able to tell if it was a man-made scorch?I applaud your work because you are challenging some sacred cows: only the Shroud has 3D properties, the Shroud could not be a scorch, etc. You are forcing Shroudies (the good ones) to think and rethink. Whether your Templar theory is correct or not, your work in trying to support it is having a positive impact on other chains of thought. That, to me, is superb science.I actually think that your demonstrating that the Shroud’s properties are not so unique makes the icon more unique. Say what? Well, if it does not have that many unique properties then one should expect to see other examples of this kind of object. We are presented with an ordinary piece of linen, marked with an ordinary image (it’s just a man) that could be explained by an ordinary mechanism (contact scorch, biochemical reaction) and found in an ordinary context (medieval relic).

Your scorches were done with a model far smaller than the one that would have been needed to produce the TS. It’s one thing to prove that one can create a superficial scorch that matches what we’ve seen on the TS, but it’s quite another to produce an image of the scale of the TS.Don’t fall into the trap of overstatement that you so passionately revile in others.","date":"August 16, 2014 at 7:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/13/stephen-jones-wants-bsts-to-remove-hugh-farey-as-editor-of-the-newsletter/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Stephen Jones Wants BSTS to Remove Hugh Farey as Editor of the Newsletter"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Sometimes tension is a healthy thing; sometimes not.

Pure speculation of course.Fact remains that Mary’s family would not have believed her explanation of her early pregnancy – perhaps Joachim and Anna did but they would have kept this a secret for the very reason that the extended family would have thought the angel/virgin birth story a bald-faced lie by Mary to cover her pregnancy outside marriage.Joseph was faced with a dilemma. He had to accept the unborn child as his, or see Mary stoned for dishonouring her marriage pledge to him.He chooses, after the dream, to acknowledge the child as his own. Though those close to him may have known he was not the true father, his public acceptance of the pregnancy ended the conversation.By the time Jesus begins manifesting miracles, the only person still alive that knew of the virgin birth was Mary herself. It’s unlikely she would have shared that secret at that time — and of course who would have believed it anyway?it would only be the post-Easter community, that believed Jesus was divine, that would have been open to such a possibility.Again, this is all speculation. how much is myth, how much is fact or at least rooted in fact we can never know.

I’m talking plainly and openly here, I mean no disrespect to anyone.There’s a palpable emotionalism tied to his relationship with the Shroud.

Barrie is not just another Shroudie, he’s much more. He didn’t plan it that way, no one did.

It’s often struck me that there is little in the Gospels about the Shroud – if the image was as pronounced as it is today — or perhaps even more vivid. The burial linens might still have been kept as precious relics (the blood alone would make them very special). It’s not until later in the ‘historic’ record that we here more about an image not made with human hands. There are different theories about fires and poker holes – might the Shroud have been baked unintentionally at some later point – which led to the Maillard reaction image to become pronounced. Obviously, flour is not the material that cooked in this scenario, but perhaps other oils or substances used in the burial process. As you noted at some point, there’s almost no way currently to find evidence of a flour-base so I assume this would be the same with other similar substances.If you don’t wish to entertain this 1st-century line of thinking, I understand. You’re ‘all in’ (to use a poker term) on this medieval model (for good reason) but it did strike me that aspects of it are transferable to the 1st century hypothesis.

As establishing opportunity is difficult with this case, the detective naturally considers if there is a strong motive. Here the challenge is that, on the surface, it is very difficult to establish and prove there was a motive to create the TS — in the form and detail that we see. However, sometimes a detective must take what clues he has to try and build a narrative that fits those clues, in an effort to piece together a motive.I don’t find Colin’s narrative irrational.

The Shroud depicts Jesus defeated, not victorious. I would think that the burial linens must have been a source of confusion for the apostles as in what to do with them. They had seen the risen Christ, so what need of ‘unclean’ burial linens. But neither could they destroy the linens for they were marked with the Lord’s blood and image. The Shroud, for those that had seen a resurrected Jesus, would have been more like a memento or a keepsake. Too precious to lose, but not significant (to them) to promote or venerate. But as the first witnesses eventually die off, the Shroud and other relics become critical in proving the corporality of Jesus. At that point these relics become pearls of great price, venerated and priceless. Now they must be kept secret and shown only to the select.It may seem an odd comparison but I recall watching an episode of Hanna Montana with my daughter (when Miley was still a likeable young celeb). In the episode, Miley’s best friend finally discovers the truth that Miley is Hanna. The friend, who had until then obsessed over a scarf she had received from the pop star, gives the item to another girl (also a Hannah fan but oblivious that it’s Miley). The friend had no use for the Hanna relic for she had something better, her friend is a pop star and she now shares this great secret with her.I imagine Peter and Mary M felt much the same.","date":"August 17, 2014 at 8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/jack-markwardts-antioch-theory/","cat":"history","title":"Jack Markwardt’s Antioch Theory"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Could the ‘roll case’ have held the Shroud?

If it had rained would this explain why some blood stains are not evident but others (post rain) are? I think the bit of evidence that works against a rain theory is the dirt evidence on the feet. If it was raining hard enough to wash blood from the body, would it not have washed the feet as well? Unless the dirt had already caked too heavily to be removed? Or the feet became soiled again when the body was placed again on the ground (in the mud)?Just thinking out loud here. From what I’m reading here there is heavy debate on the washing of the body theory – was it washed or not, wholly or in part, the evidence seems to support both sides of the debate.

There isn’t just one pyramid (or type thereof), there wasn’t one Hokulea-type vessel that sailed Polynesia, and there wasn’t just one statue on Easter island. But we only have one Shroud.I would expect to see other Shroud-like works if the ability was there. Or perhaps earlier works honing the method. But what we have is a one-shot of an unknown technology, creating a unique relic (when the technology could have been used to generate shrouds of kings, queens and saints). It comes out of nowhere and returns to nowhere. This isn’t to say that it couldn’t have been created thus, but that singularity is perplexing.","date":"July 15, 2013 at 12:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Very solid theory, Yannick.

But Jesus, according to all four gospels, dies within hours of being nailed to the cross — thus no need to break his legs.The wounds on the TS point to a scourging that went, at some point, beyond mere punishment. They were severe enough to stress his body to the point that he falls thrice on the way to Golgotha and then lasts but a few hours on the cross.Why was Jesus scourged so severely, when the object of crucifixion is prolonged agony? I don’t know, but why did the Romans crucify anyone on a day when they knew they’d be cutting their victims’ suffering short anyway (i.e. the thieves)?

Thereafter our cells diminish, at greater speed as we age.

Now they encounter a young man, full of life – indeed life at its fullest point. There is a familiarity to him, yet a strangeness. Is this what our resurrected bodies might be like?

We are not dealing with a painting, we all agree on that. We are dealing with a yet to be confirmed image process. Because we do not know how it works, we cannot rule out any image distortion caused from that process.Your research is in an effort to prove that a medieval scorch theory cannot be ruled out. You’ve made some strides there. On the other hand, nothing you have discovered, to me, has ruled out a 1st century origin. I believe you’ve acknowledged this as well, pointing out that a scorch (in the broader sense of the term) theory might support a 1st century origin.Question: a bit off topic perhaps. Can sound waves create latent images on surfaces other than liquid ones? The banding (lines) on the TS remind me of sound ripples in some pics. Too sci-fi perhaps, but could an ultra-sonic pulse have created a reaction on the linen forming an image? A Big Bang mistaken for an earthquake perhaps?

This kind of scenario is far beyond what my rational brain can take.It’s beyond anyone’s rational brain. This is why Colin, Hugh, etc believe the ‘blood’ stains were applied after the image was created.The more we explore the various theories I can say this: if the Shroud is not authentic then the Templars theory is the only one that could even be remotely possible to be true. In other words, in my opinion, the available evidence leaves no other logical conclusion. It would have taken a secret order, with conspiratorial motivations and the many necessary resources, to have produced the Shroud. They would have had to employ the services of at least one master artisan (i..e. a metal worker) with a team of helpers. They would have had to obtain a crucifix from some plundered or ruined church from somewhere in Chistendom. Or forged the finished corpus. All evidence of the enveavour would have had to been kept secret – likely under a vow of eternal perdition if anyone broke that secret pact. The artisan would have had to be something of a perfectionist — not stopping at a scorch that was ‘pretty darn good’  but one that was exceptionally evenly scorched. Then someone with a superior knowledge of the wounds of Christ had to use leeches to dab blood on the shroud to approximate those wounds.If the Shroud is medieval this is the only theory that matches the requirements of the available evidence.","date":"November 22, 2013 at 1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/21/colins-scorch-under-a-microscope/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin’s Scorch Under a Microscope"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Can Paulette or Dan explain why they feel Freeman’s is closest of the misses?

If I’m Peter or John and I see the Shroud I’d certainly believe that it was a sign that Jesus was special. But would it alone be enough for all 11 of them, and the women, to do a 180 degree in their beliefs? Would it have inspired a deep belief in resurrection into new glorified bodies? If the Shroud is the model, then why in the ‘stories’ of encounters with the risen Jesus is He not recognizable at first sight? Where did this idea come from that Jesus looked differently? He certainly looks like himself on the Shroud, no?Would seeing the Shroud alone have been enough to change Saul into Paul?If the early Christ-follower community’s raison d’etre relied solely on the Shroud as their proof of resurrection than the Shroud would have played a much greater part in the story.

Heat it on a cooker ring  until it scorches a test scrap of fabric. Then press against cloth, preferably linen or cotton to get a scorch. Take a photograph on your digital camera or phone. Then download ImageJ onto your laptop. I’ll tell you which keys to press, but it’s basically about entering into its 3D enhancement program.See it with your own eyes. Thermal imprints from 3D or flattened semi-3D (bas relief) templates, aka cattle brands, respond magnificently to 3D programs  – but so they should, since scorch intensity is in proportion to 3D relief. If it’s raised, it leaves a good imprint. If it’s lower down in the relief,  less raised, it does not.Yes, I could give links to my own postings, but it’s better that folks find these things out for themselves.Then they realize it’s not trickery – just a reading of image density as height above a base plane.I don’t know that I’d know how to brand something as fine as the micron level.

Undoubtedly some would have had that initial bias, yet it doesn’t seem to have impeded their scientific approach. Nor those that may have been leaning to a pro-authentic conclusion.Perhaps I’m trying to find a middle ground in all this discussion. Because the landscape is so different than in 1978, when their didn’t exist a cottage industry for Shroud materials, I think Yannick makes a fair point that if someone has a very strong existing theory — one which they have published books supporting and would have something to gain or lose based on the results of new studies — then there is a danger of confirmation bias or at least the perception of it. This person brings an element of risk.On the other hand it would be silly to exclude scientists just because they may be coming into it with existing thoughts on the Shroud. I suppose ideally it would be good to have a mix of Shroud-knowledgeable scientists (a Kelly Kearse for example) and some hardly knowledgeable ones.

It is a human trait that once we acquire a new technique or technology that we seek to use it, or some variant of it, again and again.The medieval artisan and his team, because this was not a one-man job, appear to have gone against the grain and after making this novel image formation decided to never use it again.

They were subsequently disguised as blood marks.I’m presently revisiting some older ideas I expressed many moons ago that the Shroud was made from a crucifixion bronze from which the arms were removed and re-positioned. There was probably a loin cloth to be disposed of too, but that could help resolve some oddities re the figure on the Lirey badge, especially that curious coiled belt, which Wilson interpreted as blood from the lance wound, gathered on the underside of the back, and which I previously thought could be a chain used to secure a victim.You’re off on another interesting angle. I have to say the sedellis theory does make sense as Mario posits. It was a known addition to crucifixion crosses. So it’s a logical presumption. Your full size reconfigured statue theory has some challenges. I’m not sure most of the crosses I’ve seen have the buttocks secured/bolted on the cross, it’s usually the hands and feet – just like the real victim experienced. Also this is becoming a bit of a major medieval team-project. You need the scorch expert, the benefactor, some men to help with carrying the heavy statue, the blacksmith — and not any horse-shoe banger — this would need to be someone so expert with working metal that he could remove the arms and reattach them without leaving so much as a seam on the image. He would have needed a team of workers because while a small crucifix heats easily and even enough on a stove, how do you get that even heating with a large corpus that would have had to have been heated in a foundry? Where did they get the statue? For your theory they are using an existing one — while certainly not uncommon to find, most statues remained in churches.I’ll help you out here. Maybe the crucifix survived a fire in its host church. It was taken to a foundry (for repair or storage) covered with a sheet. The soot on the cross left an imprint on the sheet, which someone discovered. This gave them the inspiration (heat + linen equals image) to create the fake relic, and since this cross was out of commission anyway it made for the perfect model to use – since no one would be missing it. Any major church fires in that time period and locale?However, with any conspiracy (and this would have been a conspiracy if one was trying to make a fake relic) the more people involved the more chance the secret is blown. One artisan, working alone, might have taken the secret process to his grave — but a whole team? No one tried to use the same technique to create other relics? No pilgrims noticed that the Shroud image reminded them of a cross that once adorned that burnt church in the next town?Why switch to this new theory when the one you had before (powdered body with bas relief head) was less cumbersome? It’s a great thought experiment.","date":"November 20, 2013 at 9:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/18/must-see-the-informative-mark-evans-photomicrographs/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"Must See:  The Informative Mark Evans Photomicrographs"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"And yet hundreds of Anglican priests (many married) have been accepted into the Catholic Church of late and carry on as ordained priests.

I wish there was a Shroud Expo where guys like you and TH could meet and would have access to a lab and could do these experiments right there. No need for pdfs.

We could very likely solve the authenticity question of the Shroud with a new STURP 2.0 investigation – using non-destructive methods. What are we afraid of? That we will be guilty of putting God to the test? Here’s a newsflash: God wants us to put Him to the test – because it means we are searching for Him – the Truth. Yes, I know Jesus – in the desert – answers the Devil with:  “thou shall not put they Lord and God to the test.” But he speaks here of a test of God’s Will and of his own identity as Son of God. That is a very different type of test. To test the Shroud is not to test God Himself – it is to test a relic. It is a test, for some, of our own faith – to see what is it exactly we do believe in: Jesus or an icon. That’s a necessary distinction to know for our spiritual health.If we go into a new set of tests, with a sincere desire simply to know the truth, and not to prove our personal position on the matter, we will be fulfilling our God-given desire to turn a question mark into a period.

Some commenters here have implied that the Church has no interest in retesting the Shroud as it is a relic/cash cow.

It (and it’s reliquary) would be akin to the Ark of the Covenant that held the Commandments. The Shroud — sign of the New Covenant.To this day the Ark, supposedly housed in a small chapel in Ethiopia, is not opened for anyone. Such is the power of superstition and/or faith.Given the superstitious nature of the faithful of the turn of the millennium (as DaveB has commented upon), led to believe whatever the clergy told them, is it difficult to imagine that the Shroud was kept from direct viewing?

And I’ll bet all of them, at some point in the ensuing years, thought “I wish we’d thought to check for (insert preferred test here).” I found it interesting in Barry’s EWTN interview that he mentioned the Tilma of Guadalupe and how, based on the existing evidence, he thinks further testing would “disappoint” people. He’s implying of course that from what he’s seen it is fairly clear the Tilma is man-made (but no less a holy icon). He knows what to look for. If he’s still convinced the Shroud is authentic then that carries some weight with me.","date":"November 27, 2013 at 3:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/27/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-solid-as-a-brick-wall/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Solid as a Brick Wall"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Thanks for clarifying, Barrie.","date":"November 27, 2013 at 10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/27/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-solid-as-a-brick-wall/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Solid as a Brick Wall"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Excellent post, Dan.

And certainly if you found the niche, it’s possible a medieval person may have too. If this was the case it would appear he was too clever for his own good though.

If the blood did come first (some here maintain this has to be truly proven yet) then the likelihood of it being a fake is extremely remote. The next challenge would be the image formation mechanism itself. No one has been able to duplicate that process – at least not to the point where the majority of objective viewers would agree ‘okay that’s very likely how it was done’. Colin, and others, have come up with several formation methods of varying degrees of complexity that indeed give us a close approximation of the Shroud, using materials available to a medieval artist. These experimental images would have been sufficient to ‘fool’ a medieval audience which did not have any type of expertise to discern otherwise (nor did they have direct access to the relic for study). This then is problematic for the theory as one would expect the medieval artist himself to have employed one of these methods. Had he, we would be able to duplicate the method rather easily today. And yet here we are discussing Maillard reactions, scorches, paint, lemon juice, flour, etc. Even if the materials were easily accessible in the period, the technology employed would appear to have been known to only a handful of conspirators who took that knowledge to their graves.Another challenge, and this applies to most contact theories that rely on an actual human model, is the hair. Exposed skin makes for a nice contact surface but hair not so much. And even if accomplished, did no pilgrim ever wonder – “how does hair leave an image in a sweat imprint without a little divine help”? And if the divine can be easily brought into the explanation, why did the forger go to such length on the image formation mechanism?There are some other challenges that Daveb has outlined as well.All grist for the mill. Whether one agrees with Colin’s Shake n Bake theory – he’s come up with a rationale motivation and plot line for the forger.

These realms are much more subjective and can be vexing when mixed with the science. For a person who prefers pure science it will indeed appear as pseudo-science. But it isn’t necessarily.There is the possibility that the science could reach a definite conclusion about the Shroud and still be wrong. Say what, Dave? The C14 tests may be accurate — but because we do not know everything of the Shroud’s history there is the possibility that something has altered the materials and thus the C14.This may be highly improbable, but it is not impossible and thus not unscientific to explore that avenue. Much the same way it is improbable leeches were used to bloody the Shroud, but not impossible, and therefore not unscientific for someone like yourself to explore it.I have no problem with any ‘researcher’ theorizing whatever they can imagine about the Shroud. Quantum physics, lazers, time distortions, Maillard, scorches, etc. The Shroud is a huge question mark and at this point the image formation is open to all possibilities. What matters is the logic of the explanation of the theory and what proofs the person gives to explain why they still see it as a possibility.There is too much certainty in the tone of too many folks around here.

The first believers, being Jews, looked back at the OT and connected these themes and prophecies to Jesus – one can see why. Did the OT author have Jesus in mind when he wrote of these things — no, how could he without a crystal ball? But that doesn’t mean the Spirit wasn’t inspiring him. Do you believe in prophecy – a divine foreshadowing of things to come? If not, then linking Jesus to these OT themes is an exercise in confirmation bias – reading into the past things we wish to see a pattern for. This is a valid, rationalistic viewpoint.But if you believe in prophecy, and that God has written Himself into our human story, then the OT is more than just a history of the Jewish people. It is the precursor to what will be the heart of the story. And what author doesn’t use set-ups and pay-offs in his tale? The OT is the set-up, the Gospels are the pay-off.As you pointed out, many Jews did not ‘convert’ to be followers of Jesus post-Easter. But many did. Some saw the connection to the OT, some did not. God doesn’t force belief on any of us.","date":"July 22, 2015 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Totally uncalled for ad hom attack which the moderator should remove!","date":"October 17, 2014 at 4:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"I recall Charles suggesting that research be done into possible alternate historical routes for the shroud, from Jerusalem to Europe.

The Mona Lisa may be a superb painting and difficult to replicate but it fits within the historical context. There is a difference between a masterpiece and an enigma.If the Shroud is a medieval creation then I suspect it was a happy accident; that whoever made it was playing around with a few techniques and landed upon one that he/she could not replicate – because the mechanical process was not documented or understood sufficiently to enable a second successful attempt.What is a miracle? There are many cases of people being spontaneously cured of a terrible disease (like cancer) which stumps the doctors — but is not a paranormal event. It’s not as if the person suddenly grew back a missing limb. That a medieval artisan could create a unique image with the equally unique characteristics we see with the Shroud is not beyond the realm of reason — it doesn’t require a paranormal event.

I know Colin does not believe the Shroud is authentic, so I have always assumed when he debates for the stretcher linen angle it is to show a medieval artisan may have interpreted the scriptures likewise.For the record I’m not a proponent of his theory (I’ve listed some of the challenges under Thomas’ post), but I’m a proponent of a rationally constructed argument and this is one.If I’ve added to anyone’s confusion, it was not my intent.","date":"July 15, 2015 at 8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/barrie-schwortz-colin-berry-and-some-good-reporting-in-fort-wayne/","cat":"article","title":"Barrie Schwortz, Colin Berry and Some Good Reporting in Fort Wayne"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"I wonder what Kim Kardashian thinks of the Shroud?(can’t wait to see what CB finds for this one).","date":"February 11, 2015 at 12:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"That was a very strange assumption made by Gove.

In other words, was Paul already leaning in his heart and mind to accepting the Christ message and then it climaxed with a moment of revelation – after which he is given a sign of confirmation.Thomas is less easy to reconcile. He alone demands a proof (not merely a sign) of Jesus resurrection. And he is given it. I’ve heard different interpretations of Thomas’ story. Some suppose that Thomas was not in cynical disbelief when he asked for his proof, rather he was ready beyond measure to believe, but needed to see it with his own eyes.

If one is interested in the Shroud as a witness to a real event, one that is outside normal human experience, this is not heresy – unless they claim that they can only believe if they can prove the Resurrection happened. That is like giving God an ultimatum – “show yourself and only then will I believe!” This is not actually heresy but the root of most atheism.Just because the Gospel tells us that ‘blessed are those who have not seen yet still believe’ we should not take that to mean it is wrong to want to see. Thomas was not wrong to demand a sign – for faith (which he had) without reason is mere superstition. The disciples all had faith but they also were blessed to witness the resurrected Jesus. This witness was essential or we wouldn’t be sitting here today talking about Jesus at all. God’s rule would appear to be: once you have faith, then you will be given your sign. It must be so with a God that respects free will.Every generation seeks a witness. “How do I know what you say is true?” For the modern Thomas, the Shroud acts as such a witness. Not a proof, just a sign. Of course each of us, who professes Jesus, is to be a living sign. This is how the church spread in the beginning — people marveling at the love of these ‘Christians’ even in the face of suffering and death. That too is a powerful witness.So yes, the heart of faith is the pillar of belief, but the mind and its desire for rational certitude is the hearts partner in the dance.","date":"July 18, 2013 at 9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/16/the-investigator-new-film-about-the-death-and-resurrection-of-christ/","cat":"movie","title":"The Investigator:  New Film About the Death and Resurrection of Christ"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Typo in the first line, Dan: ‘show’ – not ‘shoe’.

The crucifix, while better than a flatter model, only has one area of  mild double-levelling (the loincloth).

And because a medieval forger could never have known about this  Wow factor he couldn’t have planned for it. It would mean it is an accidental byproduct of any scorched figure.

I have a brother-in-law in Rome who is a priest and high-up in his order. I worked with missionaries in Africa and the South Pacific. I follow commentary by Vatican insiders on the NCR blog. I have been involved with the church most of my life. I have seen, from experience, how clericalism corrupts, how power corrupts. I have known over ten abusers and seen how – until recently – nothing was done to stop them. I appreciate the hard slog Francis has in trying to revitalize the leadership of the Church. There are those that would stop him. The Church is on the verge of schism in my opinion, as traditionalists battle to return us to the days of Trent. Even as there are those that would take us too far, too fast in the other direction. My brother-in-law told me that when Francis made his wonderful statement that “a shepherd should smell like his flock” many in the Italian hierarchy responded “but my flock smell of Versace.”  Would I trust these kinds of men with a new investigation of the Shroud? Would you?","date":"August 27, 2015 at 10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/26/youtube-of-barrie-schwortz-at-ahmadiyya-annual-convention/","cat":"video","title":"YouTube of Barrie Schwortz at Ahmadiyya Annual Convention"},{"author":"david_goulet","post":"Thanks for the background info on this sect.
