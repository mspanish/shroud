But,you did not mention where you want to use the God given faculties. These are to be used at the right place. to further explain my point, eyes are used to see the things and not to smell. Similarly, Nose is to smell the things and not to see the things.Similarly, SENSE, REASON and INTELLECT is to be used at the right environments, for which these have been created by the creator.
