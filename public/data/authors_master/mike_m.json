G. Fanti believes there is, and has published a paper describing that image. He used filters to decrease background noise and increase contrast, according to him the image on the back is: 1 superficial (i.e doubly superficial) 2 only for the ventral figure not the dorsal one. 3 three dimensional. 4 corresponds to the front image location. 5 slightly different from the front image (e.g. The nose on the back presents “the same extension of both nostrils, unlike the front side, in which the right nostril is less evident.” I believe the church has in its posession high definition images for the backside that has not been published yet, lets hope they release it sometime in the future. I personally believe the veil of Manoplello to be a painting. There is clearly brush strokes evident around the lips and the eyes. To me, it looks like a work of art. However, I believe the Sudarium of Oveido to be the facecloth that was mentioned in (John 20:7) “and the face cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but rolled up in a place by itself.” Mark Guscin has done a great Job bringing the sudarium to light.

Even with physical examination, lab tests and X rays. Symptoms overlap for different pathologies and I have seen people get 3 4 different diagnosis from very smart people for a single problem. Barbet and Zugibe don’t have the Luxury of X rays and lab tests., not even physical examination. They work from a photograph, so to claim that if two specialist, working from a photograph, differ on a conclusion prove them unworthy is not fair to either of them.

Just like when you thought bleached linen lightens with sunlight and it turned out to be the opposite, you admitted you were wrong but then stayed with the same conclusion didn’t you? The same applies here. 3 even when they differ on the details, they agree that this is a real human being that was scourged, crucified and dead. How many dead people have you seen? They have seen much more and they are experts in this field, you are not. 4 what they agreed on is beyond our scope of practice.

These Biblical records can be and are used as are other ancient documents in archeological work. For the most part, historical events described took place and the peoples cited really existed. This is not to say that names of all peoples and places mentioned can be identified today, or that every event as reported in the historical books happened exactly as stated.

The treatment for this in ambulatory setting is a glucagon injection which can be administered by relatives or friends and it works by releasing glucose from glycogen stored in the liver.

Mass halluscinations take place because 500 people thought they saw Jesus while really they were looking at a piece of cloth with a strange image. Sorry Annette, there is nothing to back this hypothesis and everything to back the life changing experience the disciples had by encountering the risen Christ. A first century burial cloth would be a defilement to the early Christians (who were really Jews who found their Messiah) far from an evangelizing tool, it would elicit severe rejection from Jews. If there was an image at that time (and not a latent process as some suggest) it would be regarded as a “sweat imprint” of a corpse rather than the “resurrected christ”.

The question of the shroud being authentic or not is a scientific question not a faith question. As long as we get this right, everyone will be happy. They are 2 different issues. I don’t believe in the shroud because I am a christian. And I don’t believe in Jesus because I believe in the shroud. This is why I can understand the position of the Catholic Church (and my Coptic Orthodox Church, as per my priest) in this matter. The question of the authenticity has no bearing in our faith in Jesus. I understand that the shroud can get people who don’t believe in Jesus to think about believing in Jesus. But ultimately they have to lay down their life to Jesus, praying for the Shroud will not save them. This is why there are Christians who don’t believe the shroud to be authentic, and there are Jews/agnostic/atheists who believe the shroud belongs to the historic Jesus. The importance of the shroud to me though is that it gives me the chance in the 21st century to “behold the man”, to see how much Jesus suffered for me. It is also very dear to my heart that Jesus would leave such an imprint, His true likeness, His Photograph if you will, etched on a piece of linen for us to connect with Him.

I have no doubt it was produced by the body ( not from an external source like an earthquake ) it is photochemical or thermochemical in nature because it is very superficial almost produced in a flash speed (as shown by ENEA’s experiments). It was not produced by fluids coming from the body because it would’ve never produced this resolution of an image. It was not produced by vapours because it is very superficial, and again resolution would be a problem. I don’t exclude a natural phenomena but I think it’s highly unlikely. So when left with a supernatural event I think the only thing that a new team of scientists can do is to continue what STRP did. I.e. New carbon dating of the multiple pieces that were clipped off from several locations in 2002. Re examine the pollen grains from the dust that was vacuumed in 2002, re examine the chemical composition of the shroud vs the side strip vs the C14 region. Reexamine the blood stains, is it really high in bilirubin, is it really there before the image. It would be to validate STRP work, the things that STRP scientists would’ve done if they took a second chance to examine the shroud, what did they miss and what could’ve been done better. I think that’s what the focus should be..","date":"2014-02-24","mins":"7:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"id":"comment-82201","author":"mike_m","post":"There is a lot of interest among the youth.

That doesn’t mean this person is emitting some form of radiation! Yannick, I have to disagree with that description. I think it’s even more ridiculous than the earthquake hypothesis. Some verses in the bible can be difficult to interpret (wheather figurative or literal, e.g “a day” in genesis 1) and their exist a lot of debate over those. Other verses are clearly metaphorical or symbolic in nature (e.g. “The lord is my shepherd”) while others are clearly literal (“Now there were six stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to them, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.”) as you can see in the way those verses were written you can tell that it was a literal description of events. The transfiguration event is clearly literal. You see the disciples were “terrified” and they “fell on their faces” even Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah” When I was a teenager I always got stuck on this verse. I would say its in the bible, it must mean something. I totally missed the rest of the verse “For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified”(Mark 9:6) this is not how you write a Metaphore, this is how you write an eyewitness account. Peter basically was saying gibberish and its written in the bible because… This is what happened. This is not because they saw Jesus face showing love to the Father.

The number of people who believe in something has absolutely no impact on my judgement. The question of the shroud’s authenticity to me is a scientific question. I don’t believe in the shroud because I am a christian and I don’t believe in Jesus because I believe in the shroud. To me it’s a scientific question and I believe the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of an authentic burial shroud of the historic Jesus. Like the agnostic scientist Yves Delage declared “If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, an Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection” I don’t believe that 9/11 was an inside job because: 1 there is absolutely no evidence it is an inside job, only speculations. 2 there is a lot of evidence that its not. Confession tapes by the leader and team members of the operation. Training courses for flying but not landing or taking off, testimonies from people who interacted with the perpetrators. Money transfers, video tapes, documents recovered from Afghanistan and Pakistan etc. 3 it makes sense to be a terrorist operation. Islamic extremists are among the most evil people you will ever run to in this life. Absolutely no regard to life. They still blowup and behead people today in Syria, iraq, Egypt, Lybia, Nigeria, Somalia and Phillipines. (see the link below. I would advise you to open the first video only which is someone recounting his testimony. I didn’t open the following videos because I don’t like watching these things). Beheadings, Explosions and flying body parts are their hallmarks, their fingerprints are all over 9/11. I lived in the Middle East most of my life. I was living in UAE when 9/11 happened, I saw people at work and in the streets celebrating the “death of the Americans”. 4 it doesn’t make sense to be an inside job.

They get the energy from the word of God.

This is what you expect from an eyewitness account. If the gospels were perfectly matching skeptics would probably be attacking them because they were too perfect, too polished. Imagine if you rush to the hospital because someone told you that your best friend who died 2 days ago was miraculously breathing today. You rush to the ICU and there he was, standing next to his bed, now do you remember what the man who opened the door looked like or who else was in the room or what was written on the sign outside the door. And if you do remember all these things will your wife who came rushing with you remember the same details. What you see in the Gospels is just that, but they do concur on the basic foundations (the Gospel): 1 Jesus was dead and buried. 2 3days later the stone was not blocking access to the tomb anymore. 3–the tomb was empty. 4 Jesus was alive. 5 there was men/angels in/near the tomb. Mark’s Gospel is always fast paced..not much attention to details, full of actions and miracles. That’s how he wrote, doesnt mean those details didn’t happen. On the contrast, John always had a thing for details, remember he was the only direct eyewitness to those events. Jesus multiplied five BARLEY loaves (John 6:9) Distance rowed….TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY STADIA,” John 6:19) the ODOUR FILLED the house (John 12:3). The weight of spices brought to Jesus’ tomb as about a HUNDRED pounds (John 19:39). SIX stone jars….filled TO THE BRIM (John 2:9). The number of fish caught ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE….etc. Remember also John wrote much later than the Synoptics, probably motivated by the information he had and felt he has more than what people were circulating to tell..

I think the ventral is more difficult to distinguish with just the blood stains, there is a possibility that the cloth touched the top of the shoulder during wrapping leaving a stain without a body image. I am not sure why there are no side images for the body. It could be due to an orthogonal image forming process or due to spice bags placed around the body leaving a horizontal shroud with no side contact. I agree with Thomas, the right shoulder is lower, I think it’s how the body was fixed in rigor Mortis as seen in the previous post referenced in my previous comment (I believe this position is consistent with the shoulder position and the blood flow) Anoxie, The whole body would be misaligned as would be the case if you lean all your weight on one leg and bend the other..","date":"2014-07-18","mins":"8:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders"},{"id":"comment-86061","author":"mike_m","post":"“Good question.

I think it’s very significant. The Fact that whoever wrote the acts of Thaddeus didn’t make the connection that this was the burial cloths is irrelevant because he only saw it folded with the face in the middle. There is a lot of art work for the Mandylion that matches that description (a rectangle with a face in the middle).

So when you give to the poor, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues”…(Matthew 6:1 4) clearly Jesus is condemning people giving to the poor to be recognized by others and not out of love to the poor, which is in agreement with what Paul was saying. Also, according to the dialogue with Nicodemus being born again was imperative for entering the Kingdom of God, no mention of acts of mercy or good deeds. He also clearly said, ” No one comes to the Father except through me” so if someone is doing good deeds but rejects Jesus salvation, he won’t make it to the kingdom of God.

As Hugh mentioned the frontal knees image (in negative) is the clearest indication that the body image is not affected or smudged by the water stain. It’s very speculative to try to make a scientific conclusion (i.e. The image is removed by water) based on an artistic expression (i.e. Lier Shroud). The importance of Jesus feet has no bearing on why the feet should be visible or not. The frontal feet image is missing because of how the body was wrapped in the shroud. As with any wrapping job, we start with the lower side of the wrapped object and make sure we have enough material, the top side then only gets what’s left of the cloth..","date":"2014-05-17","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/17/paper-chase-the-effects-of-douse-water/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase:  The Effects of Douse Water"},{"id":"comment-121094","author":"mike_m","post":"Mario, why would a water stain obscure?
