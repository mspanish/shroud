{"opinion":[{"author":"sharon_kramer","post":"I was looking at AB- blood info because my husband has lost his kidney function. He has no living  relatives other than a 96 year old mother (Cree Indian extraction, unknown blood type),and I am trying to help him in anyway I can, envsioning the day dialysis therapy no longer works, and a kidney transplant is the only option.  I am type AB+ (Irish and Czechoslovakian parents). One plus in the whole matter comes to light when I read that AB is the “universal recipient”, so maybe a match is not so unlikely as I thought. Although, having a “negative” RH factor makes his blood type very rare indeed.  I wonder what impact this has on finding a kidney donor match.\nAlthough intriging, I don’t think blood lines, the Shroud of Turin, religious affiliations (we are both Catholic), or male/female sex has any bearing on the matter. Nevertheless, I thought I would post a response here because all information is helpful.  Of course, filtered through common sense, logic, and scientific knowledge, information is also relative to the recipient’s interpretation.\nThis appears to be a very current “blog” posting site, and I will watch closely for any follow-on comments.  I’d appreciate input or suggestions…\n\n","date":"August 5, 2013 at 9:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"}]}
