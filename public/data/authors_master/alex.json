The last time i tried i heard a voice tell me “This is not the plan I have for you my child” (Those EXACT WORDS). As I looked up I saw Him… I saw Jesus Christ. And Today I saw this picture and this is with every detail the saem Jesus I saw. And I saw Him again at my parent’s funeral this year, I felt his hand on my should and INSTANTLY I was calmed. Now days I help run the Youth side of my Church while studying my Advanced Diploma at Bible College. I now know the plans HE has for me, I am in need of this book. Please email me if I am able to get a few copies at: alexloomes@hotmail.com Thank you and many blessings to you all.","date":"2012-07-16","mins":"7:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
