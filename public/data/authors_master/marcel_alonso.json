{"dating":[{"id":"comment-134","author":"marcel_alonso","post":"Thanks Brad. After Christopher Ramsey you are the first physicist who accepts courageously an open discussion. My answer to your series of questions is very simple. The first document of the National Hungarian Library exhibits 4 Miniatures over a “Codex”, named “Codex Pray”. This document has been scrutinized by Professor E. Poulle, emeritus director of the famous “école des Chartes” de Paris, membre de l’Institut. It is authentic and it has been assembled before 1192. But the man who painted these miniatures must have seen, in Constantinople, the true Shroud of Turin before 1169 (starting of the war between Hungary and Byzance). Consequently, the date proposed (1325), with its very low standard deviation value found by the 3 labs, must be considered as a true “outlier”, which cancels the methodology used. One of its two parts must have failed: the “soft” one (sampling, interpretation…) or the “hard” one (AMS and calculus). You are the only who could tell me which? If you have some doubts concerning the validity of this statement, please let me know, I can enter into more details.
