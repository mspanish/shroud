{"resources":[{"author":"jb_in_ca","post":"So Krauss says he’s applying the laws of quantum mechanics to “literally nothing. No space, no time, nothing.” But that’s just a silly reification of the concept of nothing. If there really isn’t anything there to apply the laws to, then there’s no sense in which the laws have been applied. To say he applied the laws to nothing is like saying he ate nothing. If he ate nothing, all that means is that he didn’t eat. He claims to “care about the ‘nothing’ of reality,” but it sounds like he’s more interested in the “nothing” of a Lewis Carroll novel. Perhaps he could learn something, after all, from those “moronic philosophers” who “don’t know what the hell” he’s talking about.\n\n","date":"May 3, 2012 at 3:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/krauss-i-dont-really-give-a-damn-what-nothing-means-to-philosophers-i-care-about-the-nothing-of-reality/","cat":"books","title":"Krauss:  I don’t really give a damn what \"nothing\" means to philosophers; I care about the \"nothing\" of reality.\""}],"history":[{"author":"jb_in_ca","post":"“Their skepticism, rationalism, and agnosticism, mentioned above, is in fact repulsive to him, and, to a great degree in deliberate opposition to them, he chooses to believe.” —I wasn’t aware that believing was something one could choose to do.\n\n","date":"June 30, 2012 at 5:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/30/wilson-the-exoheretic-what-yes-exoheretic/","cat":"history","title":"Wilson the Exoheretic.
