{"dating":[{"author":"vivine","post":"Radio dating procedure itself was not wrong. No one questioning the validity of research from those three world-renowned dating labs.\n@Buttonfresh: pardon me, but I’ve read no dishonest on this article, as it simply report the press release presented in event held by a respected university.\n@Steven: The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)  is one of two laboratories in the United States where classified work towards the design of nuclear weapons is undertaken. LANL is a United States Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory. It’is one of the largest science and technology institutions in the world. It conducts multidisciplinary research in fields such as national security, space exploration, renewable energy, medicine, nanotechnology, and supercomputing.\nThe team for this research is consists of 9 scientists, lead by Robert Villarreal. He worked for U.S. Department of Energy for 45 years, began as a Research and experimental Chemist and Nuclear Reactor operator in 1962. As a Research Chemist, he provided technical support to several Nuclear Reactor projects. In 1991, he began work at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) as a Section Leader and Team Leader and continued to work as a Nuclear, Analytical, Instrumental and Radiochemist. He has received numerous achievement awards for innovative performance, including the Director’s Distinguished Performance Award for an individual, both from Argonne National Laboratory and LANL, and he was honored with the DOE Analytical Laboratory Manager’s Hall of Fame Award. He is the author of numerous technical reports and publications, of which the most recent is entitled “Compilation of Less-Known Nuclear Material Characteristics and Verification Techniques,” June 2006. In February of 2008, he published “Technical Guide to the Observation and Recognition of an Actinide Nuclear Weapons Material.\nRaymond Rogers was eminently qualified. Rogers was a highly regarded chemist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He had been honored as a Fellow of this prestigious UCLA laboratory. In his home state of New Mexico, he was a charter member of the Coalition for Excellence in Science Education. For several years he served on the Department of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board. He had published over fifty peer-reviewed scientific papers in science journals. He was one of many scientists selected to study the shroud in 1978. He was director of chemical research for the international Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP).\nAll of their findings on Shroud of Turin are conform to proper scientific methods and fully accepted by science community (please note that term “fully accepted” doesn’t mean there were no critic against it, the same as “big bang theory” is fully accepted but also contested with several other theories. One greatness of science is it’s openness to be challenged and reexamined).\nFor your information, about a year before Rogers’ paper was published, in early 2004, the Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S. Department of Commerce, NIST, U.S. Government Printing Office) published an important paper by Lloyd A. Currie. Currie, a highly regarded specialist in the field of radiocarbon dating and an NIST Fellow Emeritus, wrote a seminal retrospective on carbon 14 dating. Because the Shroud of Turin was such a famous test, Currie devoted much of his paper to it.\nLike Rogers, Currie dismissed any argument that radiocarbon labs had done anything wrong in dating the Shroud of Turin. Currie also rejected, as Rogers also had done, the theories of scorching effects or contamination caused by a bioplastic polymer. Significantly, Currie acknowledged that disguised mending (from which the sample was taken) was a viable explanation. He cited the work of Rogers and Arnoldi. He found it credible.\nSo, for conclusion: The Radio Carbon Dating is undoubtedly CORRECT. However, the sample is simply WRONG (or, quoting Robert’s opinion, it’s “the worst possible sample”).\n\n","date":"September 18, 2012 at 12:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/08/19/los-alamos-national-laboratory-team-of-nine-scientists-prove-carbon-14-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin-wrong/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Los Alamos National Laboratory team of nine scientists prove carbon 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin wrong"}]}
