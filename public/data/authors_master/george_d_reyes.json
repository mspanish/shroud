Jesus’s book…”the Bible”…tells us there are other throwns around his thrown for those who he puts there according to his own pleasure. But remember Jesus is not a mere human, he is God as well (as the son), the bible says that God is a jealous God and all worship must only go to him that he will not share his glory with another. We can admire anyone from the bible such as Moses, Abraham, David, Mary, John, Paul, Elijah, etc, but adoration of them is not in line with Jesus’s (God’s) will. There are many other heaven encounters which Jesus has given to many believers, which he reveals some awesome things. One of them showed Mary was there and she was crying because so many people focus on her, and even pray to her, she said to look toward Jesus only. Mary has been blessed by God by being the human conduit for him to be birthed naturally to earth to fulfill what he wanted to fulfill. We all should pray and believe the way she did, that is to submit ourselves wholly to Jesus and only focus, adore, and pray to him. We should not pray or “adore” no one except God himself through Jesus who is the only way to God the Father. Don’t worry about Mary, you can always have a conversation with her when you get to heaven and she will be the first one to tell you all this!","date":"February 17, 2012 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"george_d_reyes","post":"Hey, Joe awesome testimony. Jesus is indeed in the healing business! How great is his love and mercy! I research alot of NDE’s & CDE’s (near death experiences & clinical death experiences) and love the testimonies because it smacks us with the reality of our after-life and its importance. Its sad many even so called christians still lack faith and unbelief when Jesus sends them back with their testimony. I do know there are counterfeits as Satan wants to bring confusion, but like the bible says you know the Truth by their fruit. I actually found an article in the papers in 2009 about your accident. I live in Pa not to far from you and would love to hear more of your experience. Did it change your life? Did it draw you closer to God, to Jesus?","date":"January 13, 2012 at 1:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
