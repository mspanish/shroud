If there was a tomb full of relics of the bones of Christian saints, I don’t believe it would have been untouched until the 20th century. Also, there are no 1st class relics of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Catholics and Orthodox believe that is because Her body was assumed into Heaven and she was, shall we say, one of the “first fruits of those who were asleep”, in a similar manner to the dead who were raised on the first Easter, according to the Gospel of Matthew. If her burial place was known, and her bones were there, the belief in Her assumption would have never taken hold. Also, why have an ossuary for Jesus if His body was raised? Even if His ossuary is empty, it would be strange to have one for someone who was, according to early belief, raised bodily from the dead. It all doesn’t add up. I would also wonder why a family that lived in Nazareth had a burial plot so near Jerusalem.

As someone who comes from the Catholic tradition, I believe that the one Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross is made present daily on the altars of the Catholic Church,the  Orthodox Church, and every ecclesial communion with a valid priesthood. As such, I do believe that a miracle could have occurred in the Middle Ages that made the miraculous image of Christ appear on a cloth through some divine intervention. Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich does talk about miraculous, not made by hand copies of the Shroud being created in the Middle Ages through some paranormal occurrence. I believe it’s much more likely that this is the Shroud that wrapped Christ in the tomb, but the medieval date doesn’t mean it didn’t come from the Hand of God, at least for me. “Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction.”-Revelation 5:12","date":"January 4, 2014 at 7:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/04/what-one-single-characteristic-about-the-shroud/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"What one single characteristic about the shroud  . . . ?"}],"misc":[{"author":"chesterbelloc","post":"I happen to be a Catholic of the traditionalist bent- ie, I prefer the older form of the Mass, like traditional catechisms like the Baltimore- and I can tell you that even most “trads” think that Freddy Dimond(that’s the real name of the fella who runs the monastery) is a kook.

The Shroud is interesting to scientists because it's so enigmatic and unexplainable. But to someone who believes that Jesus of Nazareth really rose from death, there are only two conclusions that can be drawn-1)it's a forgery meant to fool people into thinking it's the Shroud of Christ, 2)or it really is the Shroud, and something that science cannot explain is probably the cause for the mysterious imprint. Dr. Habermas takes the latter alternative, mainly because he's as much a theologian as he is an historian.

I'll leave it to the scientists to figure out what this phenomenon was; it could be something completely natural.

Within the community of monks they usually act stupid/mentally retarded or dumb to avoid glorification by other monks. They are extremely humble and wear dirty rags.

They  get the energy from the word of God. The father of Monasticism “Abba Antonious” was a very rich man and he heard the bible read in church, the verse where Jesus told the rich man “if you want to be perfect sell what you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” He took that verse personally and followed the commandment and started Monasticism in the whole world. So the energy is in the word of God, but how many people are willing to follow through?Hi  Mike… Speaking of Anthony the Great… the rich young man who started desert monasticism ca 285, I read somewhere he wasn’t as saintly as you make him out to be… he had a pedophiliac relationship with Athanasius of Alexandria (the monk who authorized the canonization of the NT).  Athanasius was no prize either… he had a wicked temper.So I don’t know about relying on past information.  How can we be sure of anything really… we can’t test it empirically.

Courtesy of the EWTN Library and Fr. William Saunders:“In 2 Kings 2:9-14, the prophet Elisha picked up the mantle of Elijah after Elijah had been taken up to heaven in a whirlwind. With is, Elisha struck the water of the Jordan, which then parted so that he could cross. In another passage (13:20-21), some people hurriedly bury a dead man in the grave of Elisha, “but when the man came in contact with the bones of Elisha, he came back to life and rose to his feet.” In the Acts of the Apostles we read, “Meanwhile, God worked extraordinary miracles at the hands of Paul. When handkerchiefs or cloths which had touched his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases were cured and evil spirits departed from them” (19:11-12). In these three passages, a reverence was given to the actual body or clothing of these very holy people who were indeed God’s chosen instruments—Elijah, Elisha and St. Paul. Indeed, miracles were connected with these “relics”—not that some magical power existed in them, but just as God’s work was done through the lives of these holy men, so did His work continue after their deaths. Likewise, just as people were drawn closer to God through the lives of these holy men, so did they (even if through their remains) inspire others to draw closer even after their deaths. This perspective provides the Church’s understanding of relics.”As far as the ownership of the relics in the Angilcan Churches of England, I’ll be blunt: those Churches were stolen from the Catholics who built them for Catholic worship, so technically the relics still belong to the Catholic Church. Since it was such a long time ago, and modern day Anglicans can be no way held responsible for the sins of their ancestors(anymore than modern day Catholics can be responsible for the regrettable acts of other Catholics, past or present), the relics should stay where they are as long as the custodians of those relics treats them with the respect and reverence they are due.As far as the ownership of the Turin Shroud: my personal opinion is that it was stolen from the Eastern Church, and still belongs to them. However, many members of the Orthodox Church seem to regard the Shroud as a fraud because they don’t recognize it’s provenance with either the Edessa cloth or the full figured Shroud Robert De Clari described, so they might not want it. And Eastern Christians who are in communion with the See of Rome probably don’t care whether the custodians of the cloth are Western or Eastern Christians, so long as it treated with respect.","date":"January 13, 2014 at 12:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/13/when-is-a-relic-not-a-relic/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When is a relic not a relic?"}],"opinion":[{"author":"chesterbelloc","post":"The 1967 Catholic Encyclopedia, though inferior to the 1913 in various ways, was more optimistic about the Shroud’s authenticity.
