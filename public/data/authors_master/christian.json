{"art":[{"author":"christian","post":"I loved the book “Heaven IS For Real.”  It reminded me how when my son was only 21 months old, he told me that Jesus was in the van, and he was sitting in the passenger seat and he had brown hair and white clothes on.  I also was blessed to see 3 visions on my wall continue to flash in sepia coloring with a gold shimmery glowing frame like a slide show.  One was Jesus’ profile, one was Mother Mary holding her baby and the other was of a few people kneeling looking up to the glowing cross.\n\n","date":"September 24, 2011 at 11:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/03/17/still-more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Still More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
