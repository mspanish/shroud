The image in the cloth is Jesus the Lord. The burial cloth is the burial cloth of Jesus the Lord. It was my great pleasure to do the song with one of the great singers of our time, Angela Primm, I hope this wonderful song will be able to touch your heart.\n\n","date":"June 27, 2015 at 5:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/27/times-square/","cat":"books","title":"Timeâ€™s Square"}]}
