I have been so torn the last month.  My ex..the father of my daughter committed suicide a month ago.  He could not take the pain anymore.  I have had  a lot of questions on if people do go to Heaven, or are they just dead and unaware until Christ returns.  Is there really a Heaven?  I have been able to find much comfort in this picture and book.  I know my ex has his Angel wings and is watching over our daughter.","date":"May 16, 2012 at 4:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
