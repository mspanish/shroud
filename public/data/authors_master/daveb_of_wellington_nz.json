This is already well-known through the alternative route of the Silk Road, but the article referring to a sea route is certainly an interesting speculation.  \nI’ve occasionally mentioned on this site previously, that it was not necessary for the cloth to have originated in the Middle East, but in view of the active trade routes and the presence of far-flung Roman garrisons throughout the empire, that the cloth might well have come from anywhere between ancient Gaul and Afghanistan or even China.  In the 4th century BC Alexander had ventured as far east as the Indus Valley. \nThe knowledge of Linen is very ancient and was widely known throughout most of the ancient civilisations, dating back to at least the 5th millenium.  An interesting brief article on the history and other aspects of linen by Janis M James can be found at:\nhttp://timeless-creations.ca/Linen.pdf . \nSample extracts:\n“Domestication of fiber flax to say nothing of seed flax occurred in India and China before that of cotton – more than 5,000 years ago. Some scholars believe that flax originally came from western Persia and spread over to other countries regarded to be the regions of early flax cultivation – India, China and Central Asia and westwards and southwestwards, primarily, to Babylon and Egypt. ” … … \n” … … In the regions of early flax cultivation in Central Asia (Afghanistan, mountainous areas\nof Bukhara, and Turkmenistan) flax cultivation has remained primitive until the turn of the 20th century. /   Flax has been known in Russia since 2000 B.C. Ancient manuscripts of the 9th-10th century B.C. contain evidence of linen made by Slavs. … … ” \nJames also has an interesting picture of some modern linens, but they are based on some ancient patterns which are quite intricate.  \nIf it were possible to find some DNA traces in the fibres of the Shroud cloth, then we might speculate on whether it would be possible to identify the likely or feasible origins of the flax.\n\n","date":"October 14, 2015 at 2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/14/linen-from-india/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Linen from India?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The same frequently complains when the thread goes off-topic.

The papyrus C14 dating was I think about 4th century, and the ink analysis suggested it was of ancient provenance.  Karen King is reported as having a feminist agenda, and so was a natural prime target for the deceit, and it seemed to have her fooled.  \nDespite all the agenda-driven conservative protests that no way could it be true, I was prepared to maintain an open mind on the issue until stronger proof came to light.  There was no doubt in my mind that Jesus was never married.  The silence in the gospels concerning a wife, was I considered sufficient evidence.  However many early Christian or quasi-Christian communities expected an early date for the parousia and refrained from marriage with the natural consequence that they eventually vanished.  It occurred to me, as I think it did to King, that if authentic the fragment might have been an attempt in such a community to justify marriage, and that it is all that it could mean, certainly not that Jesus himself was married.  \nHowever, one purpose of an open mind is to be able to close it when sufficient evidence comes to light.  The paper reported by CNN does that, and it seems to have been quite a clever piece of detective work.  The fragment includes text from a known forgery, an alleged Gospel of John in a rare Coptic dialect, which died out in the 6th century, but that particular papyrus was dated to the 9th century.  \nThe anonymous provenance of the fragment, and the lack of companion fragments, certainly made it suspect.  However there now seems little doubt that it was indeed a forgery.  I see no connection with the Talpiot case.  It is merely a case of forgers exploiting a lucrative market for seemingly ancient scriptural fragments, particularly if they can create a topical sensation.\n\n","date":"February 22, 2015 at 2:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/update-again-on-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Update Again on the Gospel of Jesus’ Wife"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Typo: Intuition …\n\n","date":"February 22, 2015 at 4:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/update-again-on-the-gospel-of-jesus-wife/","cat":"archaeology","title":"Update Again on the Gospel of Jesus’ Wife"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you David G, my sentiments too.

When a year or two ago, I raised the issue of Diana Fulbright’s paper on the complex weaves evident at the Akeldama site, which included some at Masada, Charles Freeman jumped down my throat asserting that the majority of these were imported and few were in linen.  In fact, Fulbright’s paper gives citations indicating that some of the cloths were indeed imported.  Frankly, given the trade known to have occurred along the Silk Road, together with far-flung Roman garrisons, Jospeh’s original shroud cloth might have come from just about anywhere within the Old World, including Asia and the Russias.  Direct contact was unnecessary, as the trade caravans commonly occurred in relay sections, a bit like changing horses in mid-journey (or I suppose camels).

Which is of course legendary stuff. \nHowever by the end of it, I considered the paper overly interpretive, and came to a conclusion of how artistic mythology is created and reinforced by such papers.  The paper is weak on some necessary objective factual evidence.  Much is made of the now discredited Pierre D’Arcy memo, and it was only too evident that the Thurston / Chevalier notorious paper had been uncritically embraced by the authors, and it was only too clear that this alone was sufficient for them to adopt an anti-authenticity position regarding the Shroud, with no mention of any scientific work to the contrary.   The idea presented being to reinforce their thesis that acceptance of Christ imagery is determined by popular-low culture, as anti-Pope Clement VII had acceded to the popular demand for the Lirey expositions against the factual evidence, an overly-subjective interpretation indeed.  \nIt cannot be surprising that iconic portrayals in the West differ considerably from those in eastern Christianity of whatever branch, Orthodox, Nestorian or Monphysite.  The Eastern focus was on representations of Mandylion imagery, and it was some centuries before this penetrated to the West. I wonder for example if Michelangelo had indeed ever heard of the Mandylion?  The Western imagery is largely irrelevant when it comes to debating to what extent the Mandylion influenced the appearance of Christ imagery.  \nFor a productive discussion concerning what influence the Shroud may have had on such imagery, the focus needs to concentrate on the eastern representations.\n\n","date":"May 15, 2014 at 4:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/15/even-in-china-they-know-jesus-characteristic-features/","cat":"art","title":"A Guest Posting by O.K. –  Even in China They Know Jesus’ Characteristic Features"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Neither close-minded skeptics nor obsessive fanatics will arrive at the truth of this matter, unless they’re prepared for a change in mind-set, and engage themselves in some honest research. \nThe matter is adequately covered by Ian Wilson “The Shroud” 2010, pp 184-188, and I don’t intend to retype so many pages from his book.

I guess complex fantasy plots with large casts of characters all with abstruse names is not really my genre. Colin’s quote of Tolkien’s comment that “Rings” is a “fundamentally religious and Catholic work”, I can however understand. It exploits the cosmic conflict between ‘good’ and ‘evil’, a classic theme in any number of other heroic epics. Essentially the same perspective is dwelt on in the Book of Revelations, and other apocalyptic scriptures. \nRather more to my liking, are the works of Graham Greene. Catholicism here is more explicit, but Greene deals with it in an unconventional and unexpected way, and creates fascinating moral dilemmas, which are resolved in a way that is unexpected, and forces the reader to reflect on the issues he raises. Often depressing, but an excellent writer. A quote from Encyc Brit:  \n“The world Greene’s characters inhabit is a fallen one, and the tone of his works emphasizes the presence of evil as a palpable force. His novels display a consistent preoccupation with sin and moral failure acted out in seedy locales characterized by danger, violence, and physical decay. Greene’s chief concern is the moral and spiritual struggles within individuals, but the larger political and social settings of his novels give such conflicts an enhanced resonance. His early novels depict a shabby Depression-stricken Europe sliding toward fascism and war, while many of his subsequent novels are set in remote locales undergoing wars, revolutions, or other political upheavals.”\n\n","date":"October 29, 2013 at 7:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/29/bouguereaus-mary/","cat":"art","title":"Bouguereau’s Mary"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My dear father, long since departed, grew up during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and for many years of his life worked as a butcher in a meat factory.

Max had also referred to another, MPH: “The Monastery of Stavronikita epithaphios is only mid-16th c. CE. See also the 1300 CE ca zigzag/herringbone patterned epitaphios from the Byzantine Museum in Thessaloniki.”  The Thessalonika example appears to be quite different.  He then commented on the St Mark’s cathedra of 7th century, which did appear to have signs of a herring bone weave. \nThere was more extensive discussion some 15 months later when the stavronikita topic was revisited: https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/21/herringbone-weave-within-stavronikita-epitaphios-revisited/  \nReferences there were also made to earlier examples, 1300 and 1200, claiming to have the herring-bone weave.  Again discussion diverted to the 700 AD St Mark’s cathedra.  There was some dispute between Max & Yannick C re the dating of various epitaphioi, Yannick apparently wanting to demonstrate that the Mandylion was still in Edessa at the time of these epitaphioi, and hence Mandylion had to be a different object from the Shroud, but I think that ended up as shown to be a false argument.  \nDaniel Scavone had written an informative paper on epitaphioi, (the PDF is dated January 2000);  “GREEK EPITAPHIOI AND OTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE SHROUD IN\nCONSTANTINOPLE UP TO 1204” and can be found at:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/scavone.pdf\nScavone makes the point that although Western crusaders had visited Constantinople in 1204, the Byzantines did not reciprocate, and the Lirey Shroud would have been unknown to them.  Nevertheless, several epitaphioi did show Shroud-like features, even centuries after 1204 when the burial cloths were taken, so that these features seemed so well-established in the Byzantine memory, that they persisted in the design of the various epitaphioi.  \nMy interest in the epitaphioi stems from the extremely long and somewhat frustrating debate concerning the Hungarian Pray manuscript of 1192-95, with well over 250 contributed comments, with contenders scarcely moving away from their initial viewpoints as to whether or not the Shroud had influenced its composition.  Hugh Farey had commented that what was needed to establish a connection was the discovery of some kind of “smoking-gun” clue.  I suggest that the “smoking-gun” might be found in a close study of the epitaphioi.  Scavone’s  paper is informative in this regard.  However the dating of several of the examples seem ambiguous, with many different opinions about the same object. \nThe epitaphioi often show features which could only have come from the Turin Shroud, but even though many of the examples post-date 1204, and often enough even 1355, it seems unlikely that knowledge of details from the cloth’s presence in Lirey was a factor in their design.  It seems to stem from a Byzantine tradition and the memory of when it was in Constantinople. \nI conclude that the epitaphioi provide strong evidence that the Shroud was in Contantinople prior to 1204, and that many details of its features were well enough known to have persisted in the Byzantine memory well after that time.\n\n","date":"June 28, 2014 at 6:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/28/comment-promoted-the-stavronikita-epitaphios/","cat":"art","title":"Comment Promoted:  The Stavronikita Epitaphios"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think there are already enough self-opionated sites on the web already (the Alkanovskian site might be a case in point).

While the original might even be first thought to be a photograph with its subtle treatment of light, his copy could never be thought to be anything else but a painting.   \nHowever, his comments are important, and the first that I have seen on this site by anyone with any practical experience, knowledge and competence in portrait work, as distinct from mere art critics, or art historians.  I think it signals the end of the “flaky paint” hypothesis, and we can conclude that the Shroud image was never a painting.  \nA particular comment attracted my interest, the “now-you-see-it, now-you-don’t” qualities of the Shroud image.  I wondered if this might be due, not merely to the superficiality of the image depth, but because the image pixels are confined to the very crowns of the image fibres, so that the precise angle of observation might be a factor in this subtlety.  His experiment with a myrrh-covered statue I also find intriguing, notwithstanding his comments of its not complying with the image’s chemical properties. \nI am sorry that I fail to be impressed by Hugh’s response, in attributing the image to a human agency intending to create a “sweaty imprint”.  To my mind Hugh is too locked-in to the results of the radiocarbon dating, and is unable to concede that they might be incorrect, or irrelevant.  If a  “sweaty imprint” was the intent, then a more convincing and persuasively realistic negative image as shown up by the Pia-Henri photographs could not have been so intended, and it is stretching the laws of unintended consequences to claim it as an accident.

There are certainly some intriguing pictures there, and I certainly noted a definite herring-bone pattern on one of them.  There was also some rough(?) lettering, looked as if it had been hand carved, I thought it might be early Greek, I wonder if Max or someone else is able to provide a translation.  I was a little disappointed that the pictures had no identifying captions, tags or commentary.  Most of the text seemed to be a kind of promo for Stephan’s article, and his wonderment that his paper had been accepted for publication along with other prestigious writers, but little other information.  \n2:  I attempted a search of the web for more definitive examples, but as yet not with much success.  It was apparent that herring-bone weave was commonly practised from ancient times   The herring-bone pattern in other art forms also seems to have had some popularity, extending to block or brickwork walls, and even to beadwork by southern African tribes such as the Bdelebe(?).   \n3.  I discovered a fascinating paper by Diana Fulbright: “Akeldama Repudiation of Turin Shroud omits evidence from the Judean desert”. by Diana Fulbright, 2010; Shroud of Turin Centre, Richmond VA. Paper can be found at: http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/FulbrightAkeldamaWeb.pdf\nIt is possible to download the paper, but only as a “secure” pdf.  The security means that it is not possible to copy any of the text or graphics from this paper.\nIn December 2009, following the discovery of a sealed 1st c. Jewish tomb at Akeldama, when a “shrouded” body was discovered, it was widely proclaimed that the Turin Shroud could not be 1st c. as this single example was in simple weave.  This inference is clearly an extremely weak deduction, with no statistical significance.  It almost appears as if the body may not have been shrouded at all, but was merely wrapped in its own clothing, indeed with mixing of kinds, both wool and linen (apparently permitted for dead bodies under Mishna regs).  The DFulbright paper is directed against the Akeldama assertions, citing several examples of herring-bone weave from ancient times, Even more complex patterns of weaving were found at Masada, including a diamond twill.  The sash of Rameses III (1200 BCE) included a number of complex patterns, including a 3:1 herring-bone twill.  It is apparent that weavers were quite capable of producing quite intricate patterns from ancient times. \n4.  Indeed the apparent prevalence of the herring-bone twill, probably means that some caution is required when artifacts are discovered with this pattern.  It would be precipitate to associate such occurences with the TS, unless there was clearly some other associative or corroborative evidence, such as when it is definitely related to a threnos, lamentation, or epitaphios artifact.  That there is a zigzag pattern on the 6th c. St Mark’s cathedra is certainly a tempting association, but it may be just a little too tenuous to make a decisive connection with the twill of the TS.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2012 at 9:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/21/herringbone-weave-within-stavronikita-epitaphios-revisited/","cat":"art","title":"Herringbone Weave within Stavronikita Epitaphios (Revisited)"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I find Hugh’s response as extraordinary as he seems to find mine.  \nHis only possible reason for claiming that on balance the evidence for a medieval date is the radiocarbon dating but he is now saying that he might be incorrect (but I don’t know that he can in fact in his heart of hearts truly concede this).  His claims of “repeatedly conceding that they might be incorrect” is fresh news to me! \nThe Shroud image itself as such is hardly a convincing liturgical prop.  Its image is in fact quite elusive.  More persuasive as liturgical props are the epitaphioi, such as the Stavroniska which seems to be modeled on the Shroud image, and are known to have been used as such.  I can conceive no reason why anybody should come up with the idea that a sweaty imprint might be appropriate for such a purpose, given the highly elaborate and decorated props that liturgies have customarily used. \nAs for the suitability of the cloth for an actual shroud to wrap a dead body, we cannot know the circumstances that may well have constrained Joseph of Arimathea in his choice.  Perhaps he had intended it for his own burial, or it may have been an himation ready to hand, it was likely a public holiday and the markets were closing up for the day.  Given the extent of trade within the empire and even beyond, its origins might have been from anywhere, and it is not enough to assert that no other contemporary herring-bone linen weave from the Middle East is known.  It was not until Gamaliel II in the second century that Jewish burials became more spartan than hitherto.  \nColin has now been attempting to reproduce the properties of the image for some three years, with indifferent success only, although I applaud his perseverance.  Might we suppose that a less chemistry-informed artisan would have struck it lucky any sooner?  As one early commentator observed, Colin is more likely to end up proving the resurrection from all his efforts.\n\n","date":"May 2, 2015 at 7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/28/having-nightmares/","cat":"art","title":"Having Nightmares"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max: Thank you for your additional comments above.

Hand signals were a very common and accepted means of silent communication throughout the ancient world. Nor through scanning quickly through the Psalter did I come across another specific instance of the epsilon sign. It may well be that the other various hand signs shown also have their own particular significance which is now unknown to us. \nIt seems to have originated with a wide assortment of finger counting systems which included sophisticated forms of finger calclations, silent bargaining practices, guessing games of skill such as variations in the morra game, to the extent that literary allusions to numbers often became metaphors, many of them derogatory or vulgar. Georges Ifrah cites very many such examples in chapter 3 of his history of numbers “From One to Zero”. That such allusions found their way into the literature would indicate a common understanding of what was intended. It adequately demonstrates that hand signals were once a very common and well-understood means of silent communication. \nWhen seen in the context of the scourging illustration in the Psalter, with its other Shroud-like motifs, a naked Christ with crossed hands over the pelvis, scourging blood marks, two executioners wielding Roman flagra tipped with pellets, then the suggestion of the epsilon signal pointing to the heads is more than just interesting. It may in fact be of some quite definite significance. It is known that Charlemagne did have links with Constantinople, and some of his court may have been privy to a private exposition there or elsewhere. \nOn the other hand, it is by no means certain that the cloth reported by Arculf to Adamnan was in fact the Shroud or else some other like object. That the illustrator of the Psalter made a point of emphasising hand signs may very well also have a significance which is now lost to us.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2014 at 8:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/30/ian-wilson-responds-to-a-posting-in-this-blog/","cat":"art","title":"Ian Wilson Responds to a Posting in This Blog"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Oskar, I think it is you who fails to understand the point.  As persistently stated by Yannick from many years ago, there is not one Byzantine scholar who accepts Wilson’s theory, and I have been slow to accept that, until Markwardt’s paper.  As I stated above “there is considerable authenticist scholarship invested in the Mandylion theory, and doubtless it will persist, …” and that is clear enough from your own response.  Nevertheless there are likely links between the Camuliana and the Edessa cloths.  Edessa may have been copied from Camuliana.  You say “Look for the cloth that shows only the face”  That seems to me an inference to the Manoppello, which is not the Shroud.  The Mandylion is reported as being sent to King Louis of France after 1204, and later destroyed during the French Revolution.  The Mandylion was always deemed to be a face, until at least after 944, and yet from after the discovery of Camuliana, we have full length images in illustrations and crucifixes and banners.  I think your reference to the cloth sent to Abgar is naive.  I think Markwardt gives an adequate explanation in his Antioch paper referring to the conversion of Abgar VIII the Great, (not Abgar V), and that may well have been the Shroud which Bishop Avercius Marcellus had temporary custody of from Antioch.  It finds an echo in Bardaisan’s contemporary Hymn of the Pearl.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 5:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The grounds for claiming that the Image of Edessa was rediscovered in 544 are highly questionable.  The story appears to be a borrowing from when the true Shroud was rediscovered in the walls of Antioch as a consequence of the earthquake there in 544.\nAntioch is the natural apostolic home of the burial cloths.  \nThe Image of Edessa was always only ever claimed to be a face, and remained so until well after 940.  How then could 6th-7th century iconoclastic Byzantines then produce crucifixes, images of the crucifixion, and upper torso icons of Christ, based only on a facial image?  Further there are Byzantine pre-940 references to the Image of God Incarnate, and yet as far as the Byzantines knew, the Edessan cloth was only a face.  It seems to me you would have a stronger case for the Mandylion becoming the Manoppello, which may in fact be your position.  \nIn that case Markwardt’s case for the Camuliana being the true Shroud makes a great deal of sense.  Further his case for the Abgar legend being a coded allegory referring to the conversion of Abgar VIII is a great deal more credible than accepting an improbable legend at face value as literally true, considering the pagan environment of the court of Abgar V Ukkama.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 11:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Judy’s comment sent me searching for an icon that might match her description – Google on “ikons of St Catherine’s monastery Sinai”.

Despite the apostles fleeing Jerusalem after the stoning of Stephen, and Peter founding the Antioch church, you presume that they left the burial cloths behind in Jerusalem, even though there are early references claiming that they were kept by Peter.  \nThe Mandylion was claimed to be “painted in choice colours” which does not fit a description of the Shroud image, and as yet there are no grounds for presuming that the Manoppello is anything but a painted image.  On the other hand the Camuliana is the very first image that is described as “acheiropoiteios”.  I recall that Scavone (still apparently a supporter of the Mandylion theory) gives citations indicating that the “Image of God Incarnate” did include a body image, but fails to recognise that this cannot apply to the Mandylion.  Markwardt examines Wilson’s Mandylion theory in considerable detail, and identifies the reasons why it cannot be sustained.  \nAfter attending to securing the church in Antioch against Chosroes, Bishop Ephraim suddenly departed on a mission to Cappadocia when he might have been expected to stay and rally the populace.  On his return to Antioch this is not held against him but he continues in his role as Patriarch, it must have been an exceedingly important mission.  \nIf the Shroud is the true burial cloth of Christ, then clearly it had be in existence somewhere at this time, and the Camuliana would seem to be the best candidate.   \nAs you would know and have sometimes posted, the Abgar legend was rewritten on a number of occasions, doubtless sometimes garbled from what the Scribe had thought he had heard, and doubtless to suit current local agendas, even to borrowing tales which had actually occurred elsewhere.  \nI suggest that you endeavour to read again Markwardt’s three conference papers on the history of the Shroud in detail including the citations, “Ancient Edessa and the Shroud”, “Antioch and the Shroud”, “Modern Scholarship and the Shroud”,  setting aside any preconceived ideas, and see if you can come to a better conclusion.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2015 at 3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Henrik, The reference I have in mind is “CHAPTER I.

It seems that Pfeiffer identifies the Camuliana with the Manoppello, but the ref does not elaborate on why he thought that.  He also notes that the image disappears from Constantinople and somehow ends up in Rome.  This corresponds to the time when Markwardt claims that the Camuliana was hidden away arising from iconoclasm, the defeats and the earthquakes.  \nMarkwardt notes that the Camuliana was the first one to be described as acheiropoietios, “not made by human hands” as stated by Pfeiffer.  He also notes the legends that on its discovery, the Camuliana immediately spawned two copies of itself, and one might therefore speculate that Ephraim may have hidden more than one cloth at Camuliana, one of which might have become Manoppello, if in fact Manoppello is also acheiropoietos, and not a painted copy (not known).      \nMuch is made of the assertion that no-one knows what the “Image of God Incarnate” looked like.  However Markwardt gives a number of clues, beginning at p.37 of his St Louis paper, section ‘Full-length and On-cloth Images of Jesus’: \n1) With regard to its full-length image, first, the “custom of displaying the Redeemer on the Cross…began with the close of the sixth century”; \n2) A full-length crucified Jesus was illustrated in a Syrian Gospel Book dateable to 586, the very year that a copy of the archetypal Image of God Incarnate was displayed on a Byzantine labarum at the Battle of Solachon; \n3) Only an acheiropoietos full-length image of Jesus crucified could have convinced the iconoclastic Eastern Church clergy to countenance, and perhaps even invent, crucifixes and crucifixion images; \n4) Mozarabic Rite of the Visigothic Church of Spain began to recite that “Peter ran to the tomb with John and saw the recent imprints of the dead and risen one on the cloths” (likely written by Bishop Leandro of Seville, who was in Constantinople 579-582);  \n5) Pope Gregory the Great ordered the creation of a tempera painting of a full-length (albeit clothed and non-suffering) Jesus, installed in the Sancta Sanctorum Chapel, and named it the Acheropita, the acheiropoieton (Gregory papal ambassador to Constantinople 579-585).\nNotes that Image of Edessa, never reported to be more than an Image of the face, could not have inspired crucifixes, crucifixion portrayals, a reference to bodily imprints on Jesus’ burial cloth, or the full-length image of Jesus called the Acheropita. … And so on!\n\n","date":"February 16, 2015 at 9:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/lamentation-art/","cat":"art","title":"Lamentation Art"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I take it that the boxed quotes were supplied by editors at the Associates for Biblical Research.

Following its discovery in Camuliana, it was paraded around Cappadocia and then taken to Constantinople in 574.  There are several Byzantine references to it, it was modeled for various military palladia, but together with inconoclastic periods and following several military defeats, and a series of continuous earthquakes, the superstitious Byzantines locked it away for some centuries until the unscrupulous emperor Alexios III broke the imperial covenant made with God and opened it (1195-1203).  Hence the observations made by Robert de Clari in 1204. It may even have been the model for the original Image of Edessa and the numerous copies made of it.  It would account for the Justinian 7th century coinage showing a Shroud like facial image of Christ, along with Homs vase image, but which later reverted to a less suffering non-Pantocrator imagery, because of this covenant.

In all the various depictions of the visit of the Three Marys to the Tomb that I have seen, it is clearly the sense of wonder at the realisation of the Risen Christ.  I can recall no instance where the Shroud image was featured in any of these works, even as late as the 1500s, even though the Shroud was known to have been in Europe during the previous 200 years or so.  Most of the artists would have been aware of the Shroud, and they would need little imagination to associate it with the Resurrection.  But they never chose to represent it in these scenes. \nThe Lamentation scenes and the epitaphioi first seem to appear as early as about 1200, often depicting a Shroud-like image of the Christ recumbent in death.  The Stavronitska is a particularly good example, showing both scourge marks and blood flows.  The subject is always the depiction of Christ in death, sometimes including the burial rite by the mourners. \nThe Pray illustration is perhaps our first known attempt at representing the burial of Christ in a Shroud-like posture, completely naked, crossed hands near the groin, no thumbs.  The lower illustration is of course not the first known attempt at the Resurrection morning visit.  The subject remains the sense of wonder at the realisation of the Risen Christ.  The subject is not the image of Christ in death, nor the image on the Shroud.  Even if the artist knew of the image, it would not be within his purpose to depict it. \nHoles are visible on the underlying slab, and also on the slanted rectangle.  Perhaps these may be an echo of what crusaders had seen on the Jerusalem tomb.  The holes in the slab seem to be arranged randomly, whereas those on the rectangle are arranged as a deliberate L, in a similar pattern as on the Shroud.  However, a slab is not a casket, such as is clearly depicted on the Cologne and Ingeborg Psalter examples.  A tomb lid is therefore meaningless in this context.  But the artist has followed a tradition in showing the general shape of having a slanted rectangle, \nYou may see pyramids.  I see a zigzag pattern, quite like the herring-bone twill.  I also see that the edge of the rectangle appears wavy, not straight, suggesting a fabric.  The arrangement of holes in an L shape is the clincher for me.  I think there is a secondary message that the artist is subtly attempting to convey, but without distracting attention away from his principal subject.    \nI do not see this as dreaming on my part, but more as perspicacity, obvious enough for anyone else with eyes to see.  You may see a tomb lid, even though there is no casket whence it might have been.\n\n","date":"June 19, 2014 at 6:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/12/navy-seals-at-the-battle-of-gettysburg-a-picture-of-the-shroud-in-1036/","cat":"art","title":"Navy Seals at the Battle of Gettysburg?

The codex is the first known attempt at a written work in the Hungarian language, with little preceding tradition behind it, and it must be seen as such.  Holes will not be shown with their ragged edges but merely as small circles; the pattern of the weave was not intended to withstand a textile specialist’s scrutiny, but merely indicated by its striking feature, a zigzag pattern.   \nMax’s principal arguments, succinctly summarised by Mike M, are strong evidence that the illustrator indeed knew of  the Shroud image.  It is reasonable that the oblique rectangular shape near the bottom of the picture, with its wavy edge and zigzag pattern is intended to indicate the Shroud cloth, rather than a tomb lid with straight edges, whereas the underlying slab with its cross marks (a different pattern) does have straight edges.  The four holes arranged in an L-shape and oriented square to the cloth edges, occur in the centre of this rectangle, i.e. on what may be taken as the cloth.  \nThe Klosterneuberg Pulpit illustration said to predate 1181 has some similarities with the Pray illustration, but is more stylised, the Christ has some draping (enshroudment?), appears as being placed into a burial casket (western burial practice), it is a Lamentation scene, not a post-Resurrection scene, and the oblique rectangle in the background might be construed as the lid of the casket.

Main work in Milan architectural advice on various projects.  Little painting during this period, trained pupils in his studio, but his scientific work flourished at this time.  Trivulsio, marshal of victorious French army returns to Milan, commissions Leonardo to sculpt his tomb, an equestrian statue, but after some years of preparatory investigations, this project also proves abortive. \nLast years 1513-19:  1513 temporary expulsion of French from Milan, Leonardo (aged 60) went to Rome at time of great artistic activity.  Despite monthly stipend and accommodation from Giuliano de Medici, there were no large commissions.  Worked on mathematical studies, technical experiments, surveyed ancient monuments.  In 1516, leaves Italy forever, accepts invitation of French king Francis I as “First painter, architect and engineer to the king”, settles in small residence at Cloux near King’s summer palace at Amboise on the Loire, near Tours. Allowed considerable freedom of action.  Various plans for palace and architecture but projects came to nothing because district threatened with malaria.  Very little painting during this period, spending most of his time editing his scientific studies, treatise on painting, his anatomy treatise.  1519, dies at Cloux, buried in palace church of St Florentin, church devastated during French Revolution, completely torn down ~1800, grave can no longer be located.  \nThe Shroud 1452-1519 … :\nWithin a year of Leonardo’s birth, Margaret de Charnay had gifted the Shroud to the House of Savoy, and the Shroud was then kept in the Savoy Chateau at Chambery, east of Lyon.  Essentially the Savoy territory extended from Lake Geneva in the north to the Isere River in the south and eventually extended east across the Alps into Piedmont.  In 1502 the Shroud was housed in the newly-built Sainte Chapelle at Chambery.  In 1509, it was placed in its silver casket commissioned by Margaret of Austria.  This was where it was located at the time of Leonardo’s death in 1519, and before the fire of 1532.  Following a French invasion of Savoy in 1535, the Shroud was temporarily trasnsferred to Turin, but was returned to Chambery in 1561.  Following the transfer of the Savoyard capital to Turin in 1563, the Shroud itself was eventually moved to Turin in 1578, being eventually housed in the Guarini chapel in 1694.      \nAssessment of the argument:\nAlmost all of Leonardo’s working life was spent in Italy – Florence, Milan, Rome – and there is no suggestion that he had any contact with the House of Savoy, in a foreign territory, during this period.  His extensive notebooks cover an exceptionally broad scope of diverse interests, and are all available in various publications.  Many of the projects he wrote about came to nought.  Although he is a pioneer in modern anatomy, nothing has ever been found in his notebooks suggesting that he was ever interested in creating a replica of a lost burial cloth of Christ, the creation of a mysterious image on linen by some means unknown to others, nor is he known to have attempted any such experiments, nor is there anything even suggestive of it in the Leonardo museum.  \nHis last years near Tours were as remote from Chambery, as were his early years in Florence and Milan. \nIt’s over, Game, Set and Match!

Nevertheless Simon is given the appellation in all four NT verses quoted.  Others trace the movement back to the time of the Idumean Herod (the Great).  \nFrom Josephus’ Jewish Antiquities: “The Zealots were a “fourth sect”, founded by Judas of Galilee (also called Judas of Gamala) in the year 6 against Quirinius’ tax reform, shortly after the Roman Empire declared what had most recently been the tetrarchy of Herod Archelaus to be a Roman province, and that they ‘agree in all other things with the Pharisaic notions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that God is to be their only Ruler and Lord.’ ” \nAnd of course there’s much more!

This Year B, it is the Passion according to the rudimentary Mark, who always tells it like it was.  There are many passages there which relate to our various discussions on aspects of the Shroud cloth. \nNearly all of the male characters come out of the narrative fairly badly, while the women seem to fare rather better.  This is a sea-change in the contemporary social wisdom concerning gender roles.  Was Jesus anointed for his burial?. The opening passage gives the answer.  A woman comes in and pours an alabaster jar of pure spikenard over the head of Jesus, specifically for his burial we are told.  It is the men who complain of the waste, ointment to the value of 300 denarii, a whole year’s wages for a workman.  \n“One of you is about to betray me!”  “Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times!”  At Gethsemane, the disciples cannot keep watch with their master, but fall asleep.  Mark’s gospel is the only one that tells of a young man, fleeing naked, as he leaves his linen cloth behind with the guards.  Some think it is a pointer to the author of the gospel.  Adrie vd Hoeven has suggested it may indeed have been the very Shroud cloth itself, that Joseph of Aramathaea recovered when he went to see Pilate.  Jesus is silent before the Sanhedrin, while the so-called witnesses against him contradict one another, until the direct question is put to him by the high priest, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”  Receiving an affirmative answer, the high.priest tears his robes, foreshadowing the tearing of the temple veil at the crucifixion.  \nAll attempt to “do their duty”.  The servant girl identifies Peter, but he denies he knows the man.  Pilate knows that it is out of jealousy that the Sanhedrin has delivered Jesus to him, and seeks to release him, but succumbs to the crowd’s demand to release Barabbas.  \nWe are told of the treatment by the soldiers in the praetorium, their mocking, the beatings, the crowning of thorns, and eventually the scourging, all as portrayed on the Shroud cloth.  Simon of Cyrene is pressed into service to carry the cross during the journey to Golgotha.  Even those crucified with him have nothing but taunts. “Let him come down from the cross and we will believe him.”  It is the women who wait by the cross, and note where he is laid. \nThere are so very many different characters in this narrative.  A thoughtful reflection can be achieved by pondering on what character we can most identify with, or most resemble.  It is a tale of gross human weaknesses, only redeemed by the eventual victory of the cross and resurrection. \nAt Communion time, I had the privilege of offering the chalice to a long-time stalwart of our parish, a close friend, who only recently had been baptized, and it was his first Holy Communion.  I feel that this particular Easter has already begun propitiously.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2015 at 10:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/28/palm-sunday-3/","cat":"art","title":"Palm Sunday"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Any suggestion of pomposity or apparent condescension wasn’t intended.

He considers various alternative scenarios for what may have occurred, and the conclusions he reaches are well-considered and most rational.  Certainly not any kind of pseudo-science!

Colin’s extracts omit the verses referring to the tomb being close by, virtually on the site, a short walk, so that there was no need of a body bag.  \nI doubt if an authenticist narrative can allow of a body bag, as there is no sign of smearing on the TSM image.  Interpreting the texts “wrapped him in fine linen” as a body bag is stretching the interpretation to suit one’s suppositions.  One does not use “fine linen” for body bag purposes.  Colin’s text seems to be that of the King James version, an excellent text, but like any translation, the translators’ presuppositions intrude and have used the words “wound in fine linen” apparently presuming a bandage type wrapping was meant.  Even Jerome’s Latin Vulgate used the word “lignaverunt” suggesting he may also have been presuming bandages, a mummy style burial. \nThere are several other excellent translations, some say “bound”, others including the Jerusalem Bible merely say “wrapped”.

There is some suggestion of burn hole patches on the dorsal half of the cloth at right.  Apart from the cloth itself, the other colours, particularly those of the figures are quite vivid, and it is a certainly a beautiful art-work on that account.  How closely does this restored painting of the Shroud reflect the artist’s initial intentions, and how closely did the artist observe the cloth, if indeed he ever did? \nThere were at least two separate times when Cardinal Borromeo viewed the Shroud, the first in 1578, and the second some four years later.  In 1578 he had also been granted a private showing.  I interpret the posting above suggests the painting was done some time after 1650, and so I would guess it is intended to be representational or symbolic, particularly with figures of the Virgin and cherubim, and hardly a real historic record of any actual event.  \nIan Wilson’s 2010 book, ch 18 makes some interesting observations on the Borromeo ostentations.  Borromeo had made a vow during the plague in Milan of 1576, to walk a pilgrimage to Chambery to see the Shroud, announcing this in 1578 when he was aged only 40.  This provided Duke Emmanuel-Philibert with the excuse he needed to transfer the Shroud to his new capital at Turin, away from Chambery, a little too close to France, and an easier distance for the pilgrimage.   \nOne of Borromeo’s companions, the later cardinal Agustino Cusano, wrote up the event.  His comments on the cloth’s appearance are instructive.  Referring to the image, he writes, “… I say, not with the human art of a painter nor with a variety of colours, but miraculously stamped and portrayed by his own body.  The whole figure is rather obscure, like a dark shadow, or like the first sketch of a painting that now you see it, now you don’t, and that arouses greater desire and diligence to see it again better;  now it is seen better up close, now further back … ”  A similar impression of the vagueness of the image prevails even today.  \nCusano wrote this less than 230 years after the first known ostentation at Lirey, and only some 44 years after the Poor Clare repairs of 1534, notwithstanding l’Abbe Bouchage’s record of a vivid detailed description of the image at that time.  A painting which has flaked?  I don’t think so!\n\n","date":"February 1, 2015 at 10:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/01/picture-for-today-2/","cat":"art","title":"Picture for Today"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh’s t-i-c corollary is a teaser, but I’d say with a highly questionable conclusion.  I’d guess that all the representations of exhibitions would post-date 1453 when Geoffray’s grand-daughter Margaret de Charnay passed the Shroud onto the House of Savoy.  Wilson 2010 has three such representations, and as far as the detail can be seen they seem to fit the feet apart, loin-cloth pattern.  Prior to 1453, known exhibitions by the De Charnay family were:  ~1355 before Geoffray I killed at Poitiers;  1389 provoking Bishop D’Arcis;  From 1489, annual showings on Doubs R;  1449 (Liege, Belgium); 1452 (Macon). \nThere seem to be two fundamental styles of post-1453 representations: 1) representing actual events, cloth usually held by five bishops;  2) symbolic as above with assorted saints, sometimes cherubs or other heavenly figures.   Wilson’s ones are of actual Savoy showings.  \nThe pre-1453 showings would certainly be of the true Shroud.  But what to make of the apparent convention that seems to have developed during the Savoy period? Was in fact a pseudo-duplicate made up for casual exhibitions?  Or are the artists just blindly following an early precedent in their depictions because of the faintness of the image?  But it is curious that when copies were made, they corresponded more accurately with the actual Shroud.  Regardless, it does seem that routine repairs were carried out on the actual Shroud, and I’d surmise that Hugh’s comment to the contrary is no more than naughty provocation.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2015 at 5:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/01/picture-for-today-fresco-in-pinerolo/","cat":"art","title":"Picture for Today: Fresco in Pinerolo"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"While it seems unlikely that John Jackson’s hypothesis that absorbed atmospheric CO affected the C-14 dating, one wonders if the 1532 fire may have had something to do with it.

However, Is it possible that the heat of the fire and the smoke may have acted as a kind of catalyst which accelerated the absorption of carbon atoms already present in the atmosphere of 1532?  There is a simple experiment to test this.  All that seems necessary is to date a sample from a piece of cloth of  reasonably ancient age, then subject the cloth to fire and charring in a simulation of the Chambery fire, and then to date an unaffected sample from the charred cloth.

Other features included a bloodied, scourged, prostrate Christ with crossed hands over the groin.  Despite the many similarities, thumbs are nevertheless clearly visible.  However, there was clearly disagreement about the date of provenance, some asserting it as late 15th – 16th centuries, while others insisted that it was as early as 12th century, a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  I have attempted to pursue this further via the web, but the only references to this particular epitaphios all relate back to Dan’s web-site only.  There appear to be no other web references to it.  I can’t even find it on any of the Mt Athos Stavronikita monastery web-sites.  \nThere were several other comments relating to herring-bone twill representations, including several from Max PH referring to the St Mark’s 7th century carving.

I think Max has a valid point that there is much more to the HPM drawing than the two leading contenders are prepared to concede.  \nThe idea that the Shroud might be authentic, that it actually existed before 1195, is too much of a challenge for Charles’ innate skepticism, and instead of allowing his artistic vision to perceive what might in fact be represented there, he gives the impression that his interpretation is driven from an agenda of stubborn refusal to acknowledge that the TS might even have existed at that date. \nOn the other hand, O.K. seems uncompromising in being prepared to concede that there may be significance in the elements present relating to the Jerusalem tomb, as propounded by Charles.  He seems concerned that any such concession risks diluting his claim that the artist knew of and intended to represent elements of the Shroud. \nI found the gallery of David Montero intriguing and inspected the dates there carefully.  The impression I was left with was that the HPM had to be one of the very earliest attempts at representing a Lamentation or burial scene.  There seemed to be few there that predated the 12th century, although I’m given to understand that there are indeed a few extant.  So we might presume that the artist would not feel too constrained by precedent.   \nI continue to feel personally persuaded that the artist did know something of the Shroud and this influenced his depiction.  However this was not the subject he chose to represent,  The picture is I should think intended as a meditation object for his fellow monks,  He had no agenda of establishing the Shroud’s existence.  He wanted the focus to be on the laying out and burial of the dead Christ, and the sense of wonder of the Holy women that he was no longer there in the tomb on the Sunday morning and their puzzlement at the message of the angel. \nNevertheless the elements of the Shroud are clearly present.  The virtually naked Christ is as far as I can recall unprecedented.  The crossed arms with only four fingers showing, the omission of the feet, and other features, have to be significant.  The underlying base seems to me to be more of a stone slab than an intention to represent the casket that is shown in later depictions.  I am not convinced that the oblique rectangle is intended to represent a casket lid as asserted by Ian Wilson, Charles or Hugh, even though this is clearly the intention in other depictions of similar scenes.  Its edges are clearly neither straight nor symmetrical, but curved, suggesting to me more of a fabric than a box lid.  The zigzag pattern on this rectangle is sufficiently indicative of the herring-bone twill to at least give pause and ought not to be set aside so lightly. \nThe array of solid crosses and the indications of holes on the stone slab may be an echo of what returning crusaders had seen in Jerusalem.  Reference has been made to King Bella and his resolution to embark on a crusade.  There are several reports of important western personages being admitted to view the imperial relics in Constantinople, even with coherent reports of some viewing the Shroud.  Is it not conceivable that Bella himself knew of it? \nThe slab circles may be intended to represent oculi that the crusaders had seen.  But the fact that the four holes arranged in an ‘L’ shape are in the middle of what might be represented as a herring bone twill, are just a little too persuasive for me.  \nThere remain other enigmas in the picture; the suggestion of a not-too-well concealed head in the woman’s drapery, and the peculiar alpha like symbol, might be interpreted in various ways, as discussed.  \nMy personal conclusion is that O.K. has made his point, that the accumulation of features is just too persuasive to deny that the artist had some knowledge of the Shroud cloth, and judging from the prostrate Christ figure, even the image that it held.  That is not to say that there may well be other factors that might also have influenced him.\n\n","date":"June 26, 2014 at 6:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I had come to a similar conclusion as Mike M some time ago way back, but had chosen to refrain from saying so explicitly.  \nIt is possible to prove a negative.

In no sense are they in the same category as their contemporary high European art, with all their concomitant artistic styles, and reliance on precedents.  The Pray drawings occur in their context of the very first attempt at producing a written text in the Hungarian language.  It may be regarded as a form of primal Hungarian art.  Nor do I see that O.K. is basing his arguments on artistic features of representations of the Shroud in medieval art.  That does not seem to be his assertion, but rather that he claims to see that there are direct congruences between the proto-Shroud itself and features appearing in the drawings. \nDavid Mo claims to find a very reliable characteristic feature in the shape of the Shroud.  Very well then!  Casual inspection of the oblique rectangle in the drawing will show that it has a length to width ratio of very close to 4:1, the same proportions as the Shroud cloth, the very same object that has a zigzag pattern on it, as has the Shroud, and the very same object that has an ‘L’ arrangement of holes.  A further characteristic of the Shroud is that it is of fabric, so it need not be represented as having straight sides, but can be curved, without these being symmetrical.  A straight edge placed against this rectangle will show the edges are indeed curved, and without the curves being symmetrical about the centre-line.  \nA slightly earlier work, more in the classic style, is the Lamentation scene on the Klosterneuberg pulpit near Vienna which is said to predate 1181.  Here the partially draped Christ, with crossed arms across the groin, is being laid to rest in what is clearly a patterned casket.  In the background, is also an oblique rectangle, patterned in the same way as the casket, having straight sides, and is clearly intended to be the lid of the casket, which it would seem to be designed to fit very well.  This is quite a different object.  \nAnother aspect that would seem to disqualify the Pray rectangle from being a casket lid, is the absence of a casket.  There is no casket shown for this to be a lid to!  What is exactly the point in portraying a lid without a casket to own it? The base rectangle conveys no impression of being intended to represent a casket, so much as a kind of slab or stone, perhaps even something like the limestone shelves seen in any of the Jerusalem tombs, by wandering crusaders.  \nI am bemused by David Mo’s assertion that there is not a ‘L’ shape in the Codex Pray, and I do not catch whatever subtlety he is attempting.  There is clearly an arrangement of circles arranged as an ‘L’ shape in the oblique rectangle, which look very much to me as an attempt to represent a similar arrangement of holes found on the Shroud unrelated to the 1532 fire.  It is true that the artist for whatever reason has chosen to include arrangements of tiny circles in other locations: as dress decorations, and on the underlying slab, perhaps representing oculi, and on the waist of the angel.  They might for all we can guess suggest that we ought to be looking for a more subtle arrangement of circles, such as those arranged in an ‘L’ shape! \n DM: “The alleged shroud in the codex Pray is not a shroud; it is the sepulchre. There are several reasons that show this.”  I venture to suggest that there are several many more reasons to assert that the oblique rectangle is intended to represent the Shroud than there are to say that it is a sepulchre! \nHowever, all the great men have spoken and have expressed their skepticism all to their own satisfaction no doubt.  I for one consider that they have all simultaneously come to an incorrect conclusion.

Even assuming authenticity it is still not known how long the image took to form.  Although the process is evidently different, one might draw an analogy with Volkringer patterns of flora which can take some considerable time to appear.  A miraculist believing that the image was a byproduct of the resurrection, might assert that the image very likely formed immediately, but that is not necessary even for the miraculist.  It is certainly not necessary for those who prefer a naturalist explanation.  A medieval artist who knew of the Shroud might assume that the image was immediately visible after the resurrection, but evidently none did.  It is of course the assertion of De Wesselow, who seems to believe that the image explains the belief in the Resurrection, while other commentators believe that John’s gospel narrative of two angels, one at the foot and one at the head, is a subtle reference to the image.  \nThere is a considerable weight of documentary evidence that the burial cloths were present in Constantinople.  The first specific reference would seem to be that of Constantine VII in a letter to his troops of 958 AD.  ” … the sindon which God wore, and other symbols of the immaculate Passion.” cited by Scavone.  Other documentary evidence is persuasive that the sindon bore a full body image.  Various later Byzantine liturgical rites such as the melismos imply a close association with the burial of Christ with the eucharist rite.  The earliest threnos mural and a liturgical epitaphios would seem to be that in Nerezi Serbia of 1164.  From the 12th century, epitaphioi become prevalent in the Easter Friday liturgies.  It requires little imagination, to guess what initiated this departure from preceding depictions and what their originating stimulus might have been.  \nFrom what we know of Byzantine liturgies, much of it is not for the public gaze.  These are mysteries which only the privileged may witness.  The eucharist rite of course is carried out behind a reredos.  Consequently we cannot expect to see depictions of the sacred burial cloths with their image in Byzantine art.  We are only allowed to see an interpretation by way of the epitaphioi. \nIt seems that in 1204, the burial cloths with their image disappeared from Constantinople, according to the report of Robert de Clari, and it is not until 1355, that the Shroud is said to appear in Lirey France.  Nevertheless, despite this knowledge and although various copies were made, it  still seems that it was seldom depicted as an art object in its own right, neither in the west nor in the east.  But the epitaphioi continued to appear, imprinted on the Byzantine collective memory.\n\n","date":"July 3, 2014 at 7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I’ve already made it quite clear in several entries above my reasons for this, and repetition is tedious.

I pointed out that there was no way of knowing whether the image was present on the burial cloths or not immediately after the resurrection.  There is only tenuous evidence that it may have been.  It would then be presumptuous of an artist to assume that it was visible at that time, and so none apparently depicted it as such.  The tenuous evidence is found in John’s gospel when “the other disciple” entered the tomb saw the cloths and so believed, and the two angels one at the foot and one at the head.  However John’s gospel is unlikely to have been written earlier than about 50 years after the event, by which time the image might then have developed to be visible. There were excellent reasons including secrecy as to why the image is not otherwise explicitly mentioned in the scriptures.  There are further hints and suggestions to be found in Revelations. \nYou seem to complain that I have not specified other Byzantine documentary evidence.  I prefer not to spoon-feed those who feign ignorance.  A comprehensive review of the documentary evidence can be found in Scavone:\n“Acheiropoietos Jesus Images in Constantinople: the Documentary Evidence” found at:\nhttp://www.sindonology.org/scavone-acheiropoietos.pdf\nScavone provides further evidence in his review of the origins of the epitaphioi:\nGREEK EPITAPHIOI AND OTHER EVIDENCE FOR THE SHROUD IN CONSTANTINOPLE UP TO 1204, found at:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/scavone.pdf   \nIt does not seem to have been in the Byzantine mind-set to be overly-explicit about sacred objects, perhaps a more recent western practice.  So any descriptions of the Shroud and its image are by way of general allusions only. Nevertheless, the documents and the epitaphioi clearly have a basis for their origin and appear to reflect knowledge of the Shroud.  The Shroud as we know it exists as a real object, yet no-one has provided a satisfactory explanation for its characteristics and properties.  There is much to support the view that it is what it appears to be, the burial cloth of Christ.  There is only one piece of evidence that can challenge its authenticity, and that is the most unsatisfactory unrepresentative carbon dating, which is seriously questioned, but which is now only tenaciously clung to by the most rabid of non-authenticists. \nI am happy to debate the pros and cons of the authenticity of the Shroud, and its various enigmatic properties with those prepared to discuss it with an open mind.  However I see it as a rather fruitless and pointless task of continuously arguing minor details with those whose mind is made up and not prepared even to consider the possibility of authenticity no matter what arguments might be presented.

Icon worshippers were persecuted 726 – 786;  Council of Nicea 787 condemned iconoclasm; But Second iconoclast period 814 – 842; Icon veneration restored 843.  So even if Shroud image was in fact known, and represented in art, survival of any such art works might well be unlikely.  Nevertheless there are hints that it was known to a few, epitaph of Bishop Avercius Marcellus d.~200AD;  Bardesanic Hymn of Pearl 2nd century; various comments alluding to chest wound. \nMore likely it was not generally known because it was concealed as something else, and it seems significant that references to the burial cloth only emerge in Constantinople, following the arrival of the mandylion there, and Constantine VII’s letter of 958 AD.  Until the time of the Crusades, the burial cloths along with other relics were generally kept hidden in the emperor’s collection.  Even so there are references to sightings of it by various western visitors.  The Shroud itself as such might not be considered an attractive or appealing subject as an art work, but it is represented in the highly decorated epitaphioi, and is there given a religious significance, important to the Byzantines, rather than just its cold realism more attuned to a later age. \nThe two sides of the debate seem to approach the Shroud from two entirely different perspectives.  For the non-authenticist, there is the appeal of the enigmatic, the inexplicable, a subject of curiosity, which may be discussed purely as an intellectual exercise with absolutely no commitment.  However for the authenticist, there has to be a reason why the Shroud has been given to humanity to contemplate.  It is the predecessor of all iconography, it is a divine gift, to be treated with reverence, and has the potential to affirm faith, and to evangelize.  We may gaze in awe at the pyramids, and the handiwork of earlier ages.  But for the authenticist, the Shroud is so much more, and creates commitment.

The verse Matt 28:1 is often cited, suggesting the artists’ intentions of representing that scene.  Mark’s gospel also refers to the visit of the three women, but Matthew deliberately gives the story a different twist (contrasts rebuff of Jews with the commission to teach the gentiles).   If it’s Matthew 28, then there’s an earthquake, which would dislodge the stone, and so Matthew brings in the angel indicating that the earthquake is providential, and who brings the message of Christ’s resurrection to the women.  Matthew 28 has the angel sitting on the stone.  In few if any of the sample illustrations is the angel actually sitting on the stone.  He is often either sitting or standing on a skewed rectangle, which often looks more like a Persian magic carpet, than a sarcophagus lid.  This skewed rectangle seems a persistent feature whether or not the sarcophagus is shown or not.  Sometimes the rectangle has a thickness suggesting a casket lid, sometimes it does not.  In some cases it almost seem suspended in the air suggesting the carpet analogy.  Why does the skewed rectangle persist, whether or not the sarcophagus is shown or not?  It seems peculiar that this one feature endures regardless and independently of the sarcophagus.   \nIn the HPM, 12th century (1192-95)  the angel is not sitting on the rectangle but seems to be sitting on a type of rock shelf, again not necessarily the rolled-away entrance stone, and the skewed rectangle seems more part of the foreground.  \nI think it unfortunate that the debate seemed to reflect too much the personal agenda of the participants.  Thus all non-authenticists have insisted that the HPM shows no connection with the TS, while all authenticists have insisted that it does.  Clearly both sides have allowed their personal attitudes to authenticity to interpret the HPM.  This is not the way to arrive at the truth of the matter.  I consider that several of the illustrations from the 11th century are not all persuasive of the rectangle being interpreted as a casket lid.  In fact I am wondering if there’s more of a hint in the theory that the stories about angels in the various resurrection stories, might refer to the images on the Shroud, allowing that all of the gospels were written some decades after the events they purport to recount.

We are not in the 1001 nights.” \nMatt 28:2 has the angel sitting on the rock, that sealed the tomb, and which the earthquake has rolled aside.  [I’ve previously mentioned any number of instances where even moderate earthquakes in NZ and elsewhere will fling rocks from cliff faces and other outcrops several metres;  I think this explains what moved the rock well enough.]  I would have assumed that the artists portraying the scene of the women’s visit, would have done their homework and ought to have known that the angel was found sitting on the rock.  But they show him as sitting or standing on this rectangular object.  The gospel records that the tomb was sealed by a rock and there is no mention of a door.  Why should the angel be sitting on the door of the tomb, the door is not in the gospel and it’s not scriptural!  I agree that in some of the depictions this rectangle is shown clearly enough as the lid of the casket, and usually in those cases the casket or sarcophagus is also clearly present.  However in other cases where there is no sign of a casket or sarcophagus, the rectangle is often ambiguous, and there is no evident thickness indicating the solidity of a lid.  In a few cases this rectangle seems to be floating in the air with the angel perched atop it.  That is the only reason why I said it looked more like a flying carpet, the closest resemblance I could think of.  I am guessing that you would probably say that it is not meant to be the burial cloth,  But I don’t know that we can be so certain.  The images on the TS have sometimes been used to explain the appearance of the angel(s) and I think it’s possible that the ideas may be connected. \nNow on the HPM,  note the position of the angel’s foot. It indicates he is seated (the foot is placed well in front of him), and three lines are sketched at the extreme left of the picture, which suggest to me the bench or shelf on which he is sitting.

A2: None.\nQ3:  How many showed red-coloured randomly placed streaks on the rectangle that might be interpreted as representing blood-stains?  A3: None.\nQ4:  How many include a naked prostrate Christ with crossed wrists across the groin? A4: None.  Objection – This relates to a Lamentation or Threnos scene not a Three Marys scene;  You need to refer to pre-1195 Threnos scenes.  But there are very few such Threnos scenes predating 1195. \nDevelopment: In what ways does the HPM illustration relate to other depictions of Three Marys?  There are three women present, with nimbi around their heads suggesting sanctity, one holding a vial presumably of spices, an angel is pointing to a vacant slab and seems to be giving them a message, there is a patterned oblique rectangle, all of which are consistent with earlier depictions of Three Marys.\nIn what ways does the HPM illustration not relate to other depictions? The draftsmanship is relatively crude, essentially an ink drawing with only limited use of two colours, primary red and blue without subtle hues or texture.  It is almost a cartoon style.  The illustration also includes a Threnos scene, not usually associated with Three Marys.  It also includes the features Q1 to Q4. \nAssessment:  Does the HPM have sufficient in common with other depictions for it to be related to them? Yes, particularly with the presence of the oblique rectangle.\nWhat is unique about the HPM illustration?  Its crude draftsmanship, inclusion of a Threnos scene and the features Q1 to Q4.\nWhat is significant about features Q1 to Q4?  They can all be related to the Turin Shroud.\nWhere else do these features occur?  Q2, Q3, Q4 frequently occur on epitaphioi from the 12th century onwards.  Many of these show a connection and knowledge of the Turin Shroud.  Q1 seldom appears before modern times.  \nConclusion:  Does the HPM illustration show a sufficient connection with the knowledge of features of the Turin Shroud?  That is evidently a subjective interpretation, but I find it persuasive, more so because of the curved unsymmetrical sides of the rectangle in this particular case which I interpret as representing a burial cloth.  Others for reasons best known to themselves do not find it as persuasive.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2014 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"We have often been here before.  The conflict of the “debate(?)” above illustrates how unproductive dogmatic statements concerning the Shroud can become, and from whatever side adduces them.  I personally consider that the Pray illustration is highly suggestive of Shroud influences, and may well be indicative of its earlier presence and sighting in Constantinople by King Bela III of Hungary.  As a past master of probability theory, most of which I’ve now forgotten, I consider it an error to arbitrarily designate numerical probabilities to events however rare they might be.  Quantitatively, I consider the probabilities meaningless.  But I consider them qualitatively highly significant. \nBela’s older brother Stephen III succeeded to the Hungarian kingship in 1162, upon which Bela moved to Constantinople in 1163, was given the name Alexios by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, and was betrothed to the emperor’s daughter Maria, and was designated heir in 1165.  As such he would have had access to the imperial relic collection.  Assuming that the Shroud was part of that collection he would doubtless have seen it.  The betrothal to Maria was dissolved in 1169 upon the birth of her brother, and Bela was deprived of his titles being demoted to kaiser only. \nIn 1172, Stephen III died, and Bela returned to Hungary and was crowned king there in 1173, surviving until 1196.  \nThere are a number of art works preceding the Hungarian Pray codex, depicting the visit of the Holy Women.  They all follow a surprisingly similar pattern.  The skewed rectangle is inevitably recognised as a casket lid.  However the Pray Codex illustration almost seems to be the first that includes a prostate naked Christ with arms crossed over his groin, and only four fingers visible on each hand.  Whence did the concept of this representation come?  Given Bela’s presumed familiarity with the imperial relic collection, it requires little to make a judgment that it was very likely the Shroud image which he had seen in Constantinople.  It is unlikely that he himself was the artist, more likely some monk who may have been advised by Bela. \nThe drawing itself is somewhat crude in its execution.  The sides of the rectangle are not straight as one would expect a tomb lid to be, nor are they symmetrical about their centre-line, a poor piece of carpentry indeed.  Conceivably they may represent the cloth of the Shroud, but it cannot be so stated dogmatically.  The zigzag pattern may be a representation of the herring-bone twill of the Shroud.  The small cloth resting upon it, might wrap a head, but certainly not a whole body.  It would be the only tomb-lid ever drawn with four poker holes drilled in it in the shape of an L.   \nThe Pray Codex drawing is persuasive of it including Shroud-like features.  It is certainly not conclusive, but it cannot be so lightly dismissed as not significant.  I personally consider that the illustration was inspired by Shroud-like features at some time before 1196.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2015 at 6:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Sk: “I’m afraid I’m the only one doing the schooling here.

There are several fallacies and even contradictions in his comments. They are a distraction and to be discussed adequately need a new thread.  Most of them merely reflect his own subjective viewpoint. \n1) The Lirey badge is a western representation of the Shroud.  Byzantines didn’t do that sort of thing.  Scavone provides comprehensive Byzantine documentation on the burial cloths, and also covering the question of difficulties of interpretation of these various documents.  The Byzantine response as reported by various western visitors was clearly one of veneration.  The Byzantine artistic response to discovery of the Shroud image was to design epitaphioi for use in their Easter liturgies, an appropriate religious response. \n2) Charles asserts that there are no signs of distinctive features of the Shroud.  That is his viewpoint but it has not been conceded by the authenticist camp. \n3) His interpretation of the western history of the Shroud is garbled by his own predispositions against it.  It draws on the fable of a non-existent memorandum said to have been sent by Bishop Pierre D’Arcis to Avignon anti-pope Clement VII from a story concocted by Jesuit Herbert Thurston and by Ulysse Chevalier, and is now discredited.  Clement VII ordered D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under threat of excommunication.\nRef: “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD”; By Jack Markwardt; 2001\nExamines Chevalier & Thurston’s attempt to misrepresent D’Arcis memorandum.\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf \n4) First western showings of Shroud at Lirey 1356, badge with De Charnay (dexter) and De Vergy (sinister) arms;  1356, 28 May Bishop Henri (Troyes) praises Geoffrey I for founding of Lirey church with canons; 19 Sep Geoffrey I killed at Poitiers;  1389, Geoffrey II displays cloth as “True Shroud of Jesus”, prompts D’Arcis complaints, royal officers seek seizure of Shroud but are foiled; 1398 Geoffrey II dies, Shroud passes to Margaret De Charnay; despite two marriages remains childless; From 1418 annual displays on Doubs River; 1443-47 Lirey canons seek return of Shroud but unsuccessful; 1449 Margaret De Charnay displays Shroud at Liege Belgium, 1452 at Macon; 1453, still childless she only then decides to pass it on to House of Savoy, receives castle and estate from Duke Louis; 1457 Margaret threatened with excommunication if she does not return Shroud to Lirey canons, Duke Louis negotiates compensation; 1460 Margaret De Charnay dies.  In 1464, Francesco della Rovere (later Pope Sixtus IV) writes book, refers to Shroud kept by Savoy, ‘coloured with the blood of Christ’.  ); 1506 – Pope Julius II assigns Shroud own feast day of 4 May, many subsequent public showings on this day.  \n5) Relics do not require an associated miracle to be declared authentic.  They merely require adequate certification of provenance associated with a holy person or place, such as part of a saint’s body or clothing.  Certified miracles have sometimes been associated with specific relics.  In the case of the Shroud, it is venerated as an icon, which may well be an authentic relic if it was ever adequately corroborated as the burial cloth of Christ, or if Science is ever able to confirm that the image was not made by human hands, which remains a particularly difficult scientific challenge.  Hence the present prudent caution. Church evidently sees authenticity as a matter of science and other scholarship.  The Shroud is not regarded as part of the “Deposit of Faith essential to salvation”;  The Church may at some future date make a declaration on the Shroud when more is known, but such a statement would not be binding on members of the Catholic Church as an article of essential belief.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2014 at 7:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Were any two blind Indians arguing over the appearance of an elephant ever so dogmatic in their opinions?

His style seems to be more about dropping hints and leaving clues.  “My ways are not your ways” comes to mind.  Hence my comments attacking dogmatism whether by fellow religionists concerning Pray Codex illustrations or by skeptics who place their faith in uncritical pseudo-scientism.  \nWe do not have an 8th century altar cloth that mimics the Shroud image, but there are early references implying the significance of the burial cloths and what they might have been or appeared to be.  Again, it is hints and clues, and that’s all apparently we mortals are entitled to know. \nAD 325 Pope Sylvester I: “Celebrate Mass, clean linen altar cloth consecrated by bishop, as if clean Shroud of Christ”;\nTheodore of Mopsuestia late 4th c: “Deacons who spread linens on the altar, represent figure of the linen cloth at the burial.”\nSt Nino of Georgia 4th c: “they did not find sudarium, but said to have been found by Peter who took and kept it; don’t know if it’s been discovered”;\nMozarabic rite 6th c: “Peter ran with John to the tomb and saw the recent imprints (vestigia) of the dead and risen man on the linens.“\nSt Jerome – “Gospel of Hebrews” 2nd c: ‘Jesus gave sindon to servant of priest’;\nSt Nino (above): Pilate’s wife had burial linen for a while, then passed it to St Luke, who put in a place known only to himself; \nThe 6th century Mozarabic rite in particular is an interesting one.  This liturgy is “intimately associated with and possibly even partly rewritten” by Leandro, the Bishop of Seville, who, while serving in Constantinople from 579 to 582, would likely have learned that the emperor was in possession of a burial cloth which bore the imprints of Jesus’ dead body.  \nThe references indicate that the burial cloths and their likely survival were considered significant from a very early stage in the history of Christianity.  There are also many other independent references.  The hints and clues seen on the Pray Codex illustration is only one other such.  Hence the authenticity of the Turin Shroud may be seen as a rational belief.  I do not see that placing one’s entire faith in an extremely suspect radiocarbon dating showing the contrary, is nearly so rational.\n\n","date":"March 4, 2015 at 2:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"An unwarranted dogmatic statement, which is in dispute.

There are in my opinion too many highly suggestive links for a Shroud influence to be rejected outright, at least as a credible possibility.  But as I’ve indicated above I don’t see that such an influence can be asserted dogmatically.  Nor do I believe can it be rejected. \nThere are strong arguments for the Shroud being part of the Imperial Relic collection.  If so, it is certain that Bela III, as imperial heir-designate pro tem would have seen it at some time between 1165 and 1169, and it would have left him with an enduring impression.  In 1172 he returned to Hungary and assumed the kingship.  Some 20 years later, the Codex emerged.  Any links with what Bela had seen may have been assisted with crude sketches from what was now a distant memory, so that exactitude could hardly be expected. \nThe visitation of the Three Marys to the empty tomb follows a long tradition of known art works in the West, where a tomb lid was commonly shown as an oblique rectangle.  The depiction of the preparation for burial as shown does not follow such an established tradition.  It may well be the first western depiction of a prostrate naked Christ in the manner shown.  It certainly shows some remarkable correspondences with the Shroud image.  I think this is sufficient to admit the likelihood of other recognisable Shroud-like features in a modified version of what had become a standardised Visitation illustration.  \nOK has proposed that the rectangle is now to be seen as the Shroud resting on the tomb, the oblique angle being a crude attempt to represent a type of perspective.  Perspective in art was known to a few of the ancient Greeks, but its knowledge had been lost.  This knowledge was rediscovered by the Florentine Brunelleschi (1377-1446) and later codified in Genoa by Alberti (1404-1472).  so that attempts at depicting depth in any art form as early as the end of the 12th century still remained crude.  Therefore OK’s proposition may be thought credible.  \nYour presumption that the herring-bone weave is asserted as being represented by concentric circles is I think a distortion.  What I believe has been asserted is that the weave is represented by the zigzag pattern.  The five small circles arranged as an L echo the Shroud poker holes whose known origin is lost to history.  Nor do I see the angel as standing or sitting on the “tomb lid”.  The gospel accounts merely say with some variance that the women saw the angel(s) where Jesus had lain, and that is represented in the picture. \nI think there are sufficient indications to admit the possibility of a link with the Shroud.  It is my personal belief that they do.  But as previously stated I can agree that it cannot be asserted dogmatically as such.  But nor do I believe can it be rejected.  Can any further argument advance the debate?  I believe not, and perhaps that is where it should rest.\n\n","date":"March 6, 2015 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I see no concentric circles whatsoever on the illustration.

Matthew, despite his reliance on Mark, only has two women, but also has one angel.  Luke is indefinite about the number of women, but has two angels, one at the head and one at the feet, and which de Wesselow wants to interpret as the Shroud image.  John only has Mary of Magdala who arrives before dawn, but then summons two apostles Peter and another, probably John.   Problem is that none of the synoptics mentions the burial cloths, only John, who has the linen cloths lying on the ground and the head cloth rolled up separately.  \nNevertheless, despite Mark’s silence on cloths, the angel in the illustration is definitely pointing towards some cloths.  So it might be an amalgam of both Mark and John, or just a free interpretation of scripture.  Note that the top edge of the oblique rectangle is still visible underneath these cloths, so that they look more like bandages than a full shroud, although the underlying zigzag pattern does not appear here.  Also, for some reason, possibly a slip-up by the artist or not, the top edge of this rectangle is out of line with its left-most extension.  Might we construe that a fold is implied. Just to the left of the bandages the area is marked by + marks, and then the zigzag pattern is resumed but reversed. Also note that along the rectangle, the zigzag pattern is reversed at least twice.  The area marked by + marks would seem to indicate more cloth. \nIf the ‘imageshack’ original is checked (see O.K. comment 5.22pm) then the underlying slab is fully visible.  Its bottom edge is quite straight as can be checked with a ruler.  The oblique rectangle does not pass this test, both long edges clearly have a wave, and as I’ve noted, the top edge is discontinuous.  It may indicate a certain cloth with a reversing zigzag pattern.   \nThere are several patterns of small circles on the lower drawing only: a) on the underlying slab; b) on the angel’s belt and on his wings c) on the centre woman’s collar; d) and of course those arranged as an L shape on the oblique rectangle.  Nearly all of the hands show a thumb. It is only on the Christ figure where both thumbs are not visible.  \nI find O.K’s calculation of probabilities far too arbitrary, and it’s not Bayesian statistics.  It is in the accumulation of shroud-like features that must persuade that the artist knows something of the Shroud.  Any suggestion of Egyptian pyramids is utterly out of context of the Codex Pray, essentially an orthodox christian psalter and pyramids are irrelevant. \nRegardless of agreement on this detail or that, the evidence mounts up that as early as 1195, even some unknown Hungarian monk knew something of the Shroud and the features unique to it.  The Shroud is not the subject of his picture, and it would be a distraction to figure it in what is after all a simple representation of his subject, a Lamentation at the Christ laid out in death, and the wonder of the Holy women at his implied resurrection.  He was not setting out to convince any 21st century skeptic of the authenticity of a relic, but to provide a simple meditation icon for his contemporary monks.  Nevertheless he was able to draw on certain resources that he and his brethren evidently knew about, which was enough to provide robust discussion some 800 years after he had inscribed it.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2014 at 10:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A further feature that I’ve just this minute noticed and I don’t recall any previous comment about it.

I was particularly searching for examples from Eastern Europe, of which there seemed very few indeed.  I noted a singular Turkish example, but it was quite elemental, almost crude and conveyed little.  I would have liked to have seen a few examples from about the Balkans, a little closer to Hungary. \nOne striking example was from Bohemia.  It did include an empty sarcophagus, with just a few cloths inside, and it did show an oblique rectangle rising from inside the sarcophagus, and having the suggestion of a pattern.  If it was intended to represent a casket lid, then I doubt it would have covered the space.  It might even conceivably represent a large sheet such as a shroud. \nIs not an empty sarcophagus, more of a Western Europe tradition, reflecting that culture of burial.  Certainly the gospels do not mention a sarcophagus nor any type of casket.  It is essentially an artistic invention reflecting a local burial practice.  I doubt that sarcophagi are represented in any examples of Byzantine Christian art of the burial, although I might be corrected on this. \nThe Pray Codex illustration of the Three Marys does not illustrate an empty sarcophagus, in any way like the various Western Europe examples.  It appears to be more of a stone slab, which is likely a lot closer to the truth of the actual burial.  It was doubtless influenced by Bela III sojourn in Constantinople, which then had no tradition of representing sarcophagi in burial or resurrection art.  If then there is no sarcophagus represented, then there can be no lid to it, and the oblique rectangle in the Pray Codex Three Marys illustration, may well represent something entirely different!\n\n","date":"March 11, 2015 at 6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"\nDavor Aslanovski :Dan did post that paper here.I have nothing to reply to the rest of your comment.You are an adolescent in your sixties and I will from now on ignore you completely.\n“… and doesn’t even mention the Cherubim gates in Antioch – no one here read it.”  I read it.\nAs to my age, you flatter me.\nI might have replied in kind, but shall not!\n\n","date":"September 7, 2012 at 4:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I read the full thread of comments at Dan’s posting of 18 March 2013, as soon as I came across Colin’s back-reference to it, and am fully conversant with all the arguments presented there.

He saw a yawning gap in its history prior to 1350 that needed to be accounted for, if ever the Shroud was to be taken more seriously.

His results are certainly arguable by those who claim to know a great deal  more about art history, such as yourself, than they are willing to credit Wilson with.\nThe history of academia in whatever field is replete with examples of faulty received wisdom, that persisted for a time, but later had to be discarded and rewritten.

Meantime a more open-minded approach could be more fruitful in bringing that about. \nNow to some of the points you have made above.\nI was amazed that you were able to find in Belting a reference to a cloth with an earlier image ‘apparently venerated in Byzantium as Christ’s burial cloth’.  You say that Belting considers that the Shroud was a medieval copy of that cloth.  From what we now know of the Shroud, that won’t wash at all.  We know from its various properties that it was quite beyond the powers of any medieval forger to produce what we now have.  I don’t intend to dwell on those aspects here, as they are available to all who wish to pursue the topic with an open mind.  But caution is of course required, as there are claims which even pro-authenticists would hesitate to accept, but others that seem conclusive. \nHere are a few historic references, which you may or may not be well aware of concerning the cloth(s) held in Constantinople (Byzantium):\n(a) Guscin’s translation of 12th C.Latin manuscript Tarrogonensis 55: said to be originally written by a pilgrim who spent a long time in Constantinople in 1090.  The pilgrim refers to a linen cloth with the face of the Lord Jesus made by direct contact, held with greater reverence than other relics in the emperor’s palace, kept locked away in a golden case   Only the emperor is permitted to see it.  The case used to be open once, but the city was hit by great earthquakes. As a result of a heavenly vision, the relic was hidden away from human eyes and kept locked up, and the earthquakes stopped.\nNow it seems that Constantinople is not at all prone to such earthquakes, but we know that Edessa was.  So it seems very likely that this is the Image of Edessa, but no-one gets to see it around this time, except the emperor.\n(b) Around 1130, high ranking western visitors are shown the emperor’s collection of relics.  Normandy-based monk Orderic Vitalis reports that the Jesus-imprinted Edessa cloth, besides Jesus’ facial imprint displays ‘the form and size of the Lord’s body to all who look upon it’,  [Ord Vit, Historia Ecclesia, Pt II, Book IX, 8].  This might seem to be a second-hand report, but it seems that Gervase of Tilbury makes a similar observation [Gerv of Til, Otia Imperiala III] .\n(c) Dobschutz Christusbilder Beilage III, p. 134: Refers to Latin Abgar Legend,.where\n Christ spreads out his whole body on a linen cloth, … majestic form of his whole body  … divinely transferred … kept in Syria Mesopotamia at the city of Edessa in a great cathedral. \nI wonder about these references, and whether after all there may very well be more to some of the assertions made by Wilson, than others seem prepared to acknowledge.  It does seem that some time around 1130 at any rate, there came to be recognised in Constantinople, the realisation that they had come to be in possession of Christ’s burial cloths.  Why Belting seems unable to acknowledge that this is the present Shroud held in Turin, I would not know.  Unless he is relying on the 100 year old Chevalier & Thurston version of the D’Arcis memorandum now shown to be a deliberate fraud.  Or perhaps it is the missing years between 1204 and 1350 that trouble him.  \nPerhaps what matters now, is what the hard sciences can make of the Shroud, and what might be made of it in religious terms.  But it is a pity that Official Historians cannot seem to match a similar challenge as to its provenance.  Hence the so-called amateurs and enthusiasts can be expected to continue their efforts in coming to their own conclusions, as best they can.\n\n","date":"September 8, 2012 at 6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think Charles may have misunderstood my intention of the quotes at #17.  I concur that (a) Tarrogonensis 55 clearly refers to the Image of Edessa, but that few seemed to have examined it closely to determine its true nature.  However (b) and (c) suggest to me that by 1130 there had come a growing realisation among the Byzantines that somehow they had come in possession of the burial cloths   Wilson of course identifies this with the Image of Edessa, but I’m not pursung that issue in this comment.  There remains the question of how the burial cloths had come to be in Constantinople but were only recognised as such at that late date.  Barbet mentions a late 12th century comment by Nicocephorus Callistus that in the year 436 the Empress Pulcheria deposited the linen cloths in the Blachernae church, which is intriguing in view of Robert de Clari’s comment, but Nicocephorus being such a late commentator, this might probably be discounted. \nI am happy that Charles seems to have clarified his approach to relics in his first para at #18, by saying that most of these were not genune, as in his paper that stirred up Stephen Jones, he seems to damn them all.  He now seems to be prepared to concede that at least some may in fact have been genuine.   One explanation of why there may be little reference to relics in the early Church, was of course that during its persection under the Roman Empire, they were not going to give any secrets away and risk losing what they treasured.  Constantine & Helena very likely saw political advantage in emphasising a cult of relics as it provided a tangible means of connecting their dynasty with Christian origins.  As an aside, I would also mention the long-standing practice, still current, of consecrating altars with an altar stone containing alleged relics of saints.  The tradition is said to date from the early Roman era practice of celebrating eucharistic worship on the bones of the martyrs in the catacombs. \nThere are a number of indirect 4th century references to the Shroud or burial cloths:\nIn AD 325, Pope Sylvester established – “that Mass be celebrated on an altar covered with a cloth of linen consecrated by the Bishop, as if it were the clean Shroud of Christ.”\nTheodore of Mopsuestia (350-428) describes the role of deacons: “When they bring up (the oblation at the offertory) they place it on the altar for the completed representation of the passion so that we may think of Him on the altar as if He were placed in the sepulchre after having received the passion … the deacons who spread the linens on the altar represent the figure of the linen cloths at the burial….”\nSaint Nino of Georgia (4th C): “Now they did not find the sudurium, but it is said to have been found by Peter, who took it and kept it, but we know not if it has ever been discovered.”\nIshodad of Merv writes:” …the (sudura= sudarium) … remained with him [Peter] … head. And whenever he made an ordination, he arranged it on his *head … just as even … bishops of the Church arrange the turbans that are on their heads… in place of that sudarium”  [Shroud is obviously too large – it may refer to the head cloth]\nThe 6th C Mozarabic rite reveals that: “Peter ran with John to the tomb and saw the recent\nimprints of the dead and risen man on the linens.”\nI can provide the citations for these if Charles wishes to pursue them further. \nI think that it is evident that there was rather more interest in the burial cloths in the early church than many seem to have been prepared to concede.\n\n","date":"September 9, 2012 at 5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I note that the quote does not appear on p.9 in the on-line Amazon preview of the 1996 edition, which I checked on following up a citation of the quote given for the 1998 edition.

He himself admits to it trying the reader’s patience, but never mind. I can understand reasons why Dan may have chosen not to post it here, which I dare say had less to do with the omission of the Gates of the Cherubim, cryptology, or fancy pictures, than the fact that it deals with a particular abstract specialised issue in the theory of art and art interpretation.  The main message I took from it is that artistic works may have a life of their own in that each era will interpret them in accordance with its own prevailing culture, whether that is theological-patristic, medieval-miraculous, or whatever the prevailing modern culture might be.  The original intent of the artist is apparently less significant than what we might imagine(???)  I was somewhat reminded of the paradox “What sound does a tree make when it falls in a forest with no-one present to hear it?”  This is by no means intended to discourage him in pursuing the topic further, which might very well have some value in extending our understanding or meaning of art forms. \n2) My point in raising this issue was that I found it strained my credulity that the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople was greeted with such fanfare, yet the arrival of the burial cloths there, as a separate relic did not even raise a whisper.  All we have are hints and clues of its presence.  Some would maintain of course that the burial cloths were never in Constantinople, but that I fear only strains my credulity even more so.  It would seem that the arrival of the burial cloths was by some means concealed, unknown or only gradually came to light, \n3) I concur with Davor’s basic thesis that corroboration is required before arriving at academic conclusions, that might otherwise be too hasty.  However I can assure him that even in a NZ University, rather more is required for a major in Religious Studies than the reading of an excellent single work by some popular author.  The syllabus is extensive ranging from Ancient Religions to the modern Universal, Primal (polynesian, micronesian etc), critical issues of modern concern, phenomenology, oriental and all the rest.  I am not entirely ignorant of such matters. \n4) It is clear that Davor can only have glanced through this section and has misinterpreted it.  If he is not aware that John Curcuas was CIC of all the armies in Anatolia, was victorious against the Bulgars, with excursions into Armenia and Mesopotamia, and ventured against the Abbasid caliphate, then he is even more ignorant about this potential Alexander than I am. \n5) Davor may pooh-pooh the significance of the Vignon markings, and lament the lack of dimensional correlations if he so chooses.  I’ve noticed his lack of scientific appreciation previously, and 15 points of corroboration are too many to dismiss so lightly.  His tendency to question the sanity of those he degrees with is ad hominem and in the case of Paul Vignon, I find it offensive.\n\n","date":"September 7, 2012 at 7:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I certainly would not presume to challenge such a distinguished scholar as Hans Belting on matters of Byzantine art.  However there are phenomena (art works) and the interpretation of those phenomena is a separate issue,  Being human, we all have to live with the consequences of our mistakes in any such interpretations.    \nIt is interesting that Belting makes the point that many such images were made in the sixth century.  Various features are frequently repeated, slavishly, even when they seem to make little artistic sense.  It is a no-brainer that there must have been an original template which became standard.  And then others more geographically remote would use copies of the standard template (We are.not talking modern photography here). \nWhat was the template commonly used?  Was it the “Christ Pantocrator”, the “Image of Eddessa”, the “Mandylion” or something else?  From the Byzantine chronicle, to the extent it might be believed, we can infer that there were at least three such claiming to be the original, the Orthodox, the Monophysite, and the Nestorian.  Very likely there were others.  Perhaps one such copy became the “Veronica” or the “Holy Face of Manopello”.  Not only the multiplicity of images, but also different names for what may have been the same object, contribute to our modern confusion.  It is significant that the various copies made all radiate out from Edessa, as Belting asserts, all claiming to be copies or likenesses of the “Image of Edessa”, possibly subsequently modified by local artistic conventions. \nLet us now turn to the Turin Shroud.  I do not accept the following circular reasoning, which seems to be frequently promoted.  “Byzantine art was loth to represent a dead Christ and blood stains.  Icons show a live and triumphant Christ without blood stains.  The modern negative photo we have of the image of the Shroud show a very dead Christ with blood stains.  Therefore notwithstanding any common features between the Shroud image and the icons, the image on the Shroud could not have been used as the original template.” \nWe are aware that Paul Vignon identified some 15 oddities frequently appearing in Byzantine portraits of Christ, even when they seemed to make little artistic sense, and even when they dated from the 6th century as Belting asserts.  Some little time back Davor Aslanovski posted on his website a crude parody of the Vignon observations which utterly fails to do them any justice.  All of the 15 Vignon features appear on the Turin Shroud.  \nSo we are left with two possibilities.  Either a medieval forger anticipated Vignon and included the various features he had discovered from icons onto his work.  Or else the Shroud itself was the 6th century source for the original template.  Some of the Vignon markings only make sense in terms of folds or creases in the cloth.  How credible is it that a 6th century Edessan forger could make such an artifact with all the properties that only our modern era has discovered?  And remember, Belting himself has said that the icons emanated from Edessa!\n\n","date":"September 6, 2012 at 8:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Next topic, not unrelated?

Frei’s work is disputed, although Israeli botanists since have also made comparable claims. The arogonite limestone analysis by Nitowski et al remains unproven and has not been peer reviewed and there are gaps. The detailed forensic work by Barbet, Willis and others remains so far the best argument for authentictity, but even here, there is disagreement among the experts. Whatever process was involved resulting in an apparent negative with 3-D information is mysterious, yet may have been produced by some as yet unknown natural process. The appearance of Shroud-like faces in icongraphy dating from the 6th century is barely persuasive by itself.  Fanti’s work in dating the cloth through its physical properties is interesting, but is novel and yet to be accepted by the scientific community. The evidence of the blood-stains is also persuasive, but were they shed by the victim of a crucifixion, or were they added after the making of the image?  Despite the work of Rogers and others, no-one has yet discovered a means by which an image with the same properties might be formed in a convincing way.  There have been critics through the ages, from Bishop D’Arcis, Herbert Thurston, and more latterly the C-14 scientists. \nAlthough circumstantial, taken together, the weight of the evidence persuades many, including myself, that the Shroud is indeed the burial cloth of Christ.  But that does not make it a rigorous proof, and I believe it can be only accepted by an act of faith based on this circumstantial evidence. There remains the question of provenance which remains an important missing link. This was recognised by Maurus Green, and as it happens also by Ian Wilson.  Wilson attempted to fill that important gap, and more recent scholars have attempted to improve on it.  But still, the “experts” reject these claims as unprofessional and suspect. \nThe question of provenance is therefore important, and cannot be brushed aside as a “side-show”.  However until such time as the scientists can improve their game, by a more rigorous approach to their investigations, it is unlikely to be taken seriously by the majority of historians.

I have been a specialist myself during my working life, and I have also been a generalist.  So I think I know and understand the strengths and weaknesses of both callings.  \nWithout wishing to bore you with personal details, my first specialty was in the design and construction of certain major civil engineering structures, subject to heavy dynamic loads, significant seismic effects and prone to foundation scour, of a kind unique to NZ.  I spent some 13 years in this specialty.  I have been in other specialties, such as the design of certain auditing and sampling systems.  Some of my generalist work involved investment risk assessments across a full breadth of engineering projects, civil, structural, architectural, mechanical, electric traction, communications and information technology, and other such trivia including the management of major capital investment programmes.  I feel I had a most satisfying and fascinating engineering career. Now to the point! \nThe strength of the specialist is that a narrow focus can be brought to bear on highly technical matters, in a way that cannot be done by a generalist.  Conversely the weakness of the specialist is that he is not fit for much else, without a major retraining programme.  His particular specialty is the entire world for the committed specialist, his particular strength is also his weakness.  He becomes too narrowly focussed, and he is prone to obsess about it. \nThus in the case of the specialist in Byzantine history for instance, he will generally be entirely ignorant about matters scientific.  The world of blood stains, blood types, recognition of pollen grains, textile weaves, carbon dating, imaging processes, chemistry, finer points of geometry are a closed book to him.  While others might manage at least a  superficial grasp of the significance of such matters, the Byzantine historian specialist will not have time for any of this.  And what is true for one kind of specialist, is also true for other specialists,  Your specialist in chemistry for instance may be found wanting in the matter of Byzantine history, general forensics, an inability to see the logical connections among evidential sources and be unable to draw a logical synthesised conclusion.  Certainly your chemist will, most of the time, be able to provide you with sound advice and factual conclusions providing that he stays within the limits of his discipline.   \nI mentioned the susceptibility to obsession of the specialist.  Thus what he accuses in others he will fail to see in himself.  Just read Davor’s primary posting above.  He accuses those involved in discussing the Shroud with various kinds of bad faith.  Does he deal with the various arguments brought to bear on the subject? No! He likens them to pornophiles!  He accuses them of Ad hominem arguments, which may be fair comment for some of what appears here from time to time.  But then he himsef brings contempt to bear on various named bloggers.  I say “Physician, Heal thyself!”         \nDavor sees sindonology as some kind of heresy.  The truth of the matter is that the great majority of sympathetic bloggers on this site consider this relic important, because for various reasons they believe it may well be the burial cloth of their Lord and Saviour.  As such it is potentially the most important relic in all of Christendom.  However its authenticity is by no means so clear to others.  There is such a thing as constructive conflict in coming to the truth of such matters which hopefully might be fruitful within our own lifetimes if we are lucky.  Such conflict should be confined to the weight of argument, and not to persons.  However bad faith can at times be only too apparent, and can be a challenge even to Christian patience.   \nWhen the formerly agnostic Yves Delage, Sorbonne’s professor of comparative anatomy, presented his objective findings on the Shroud before the French Academy of Science, he encountered downright hostility, purely it would seem on the basis of the subject-matter. The Academy was dominated by so-called rationalists and free-thinkers, anti-religious to a man, a survival perhaps of the “French Enlightenment”.  There remains a a distrust of Academia among those devoted to what they consider to be this most precious relic, a distrust which Academia itself has done little to dissipate, including I must say, what I have so far read from Byzantine historians. \nThe great British chronicler of the Second World War, Sir Winston Churchill was once reported to have said, “History is Bunk!”  I sometimes wonder if he was right!\n\n","date":"September 4, 2012 at 7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/04/so-what-is-the-problem-ian-wilson-freeman-jones-or-this-cult-of-ours/","cat":"art","title":"So what is the problem: Ian Wilson, Freeman, Jones or this “cult” of ours?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Consider these words of the distinguished German art scholar, Hans Belting:\n“Art historians dislike the Shroud, as the latter is either an orignal (thus antedating Christian imagery), or it is a late medieval fake (thus postdating the history of intelligent and beautiful images)” : Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image before the Era of Art 1998, p.9. \nSo we know that the Byzantine Art historians, are uncomfortable with it.  From the various contributions they have made recently, it would seem that they are quite prepared even to deny that such a cloth was ever in Constantinople.  Not for them the evidence of Robert de Clari, the Hungarian Pray Manuscript, the complaint of the Patriarch to the Pope that the French Crusaders had made off with it, nor any other such clues.  That is their affair, and it may very well come back to haunt them.  Now for those who deem it credible that such a cloth was indeed  in Constantinople before the year 1204, and was the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, consider the following: \nSo the Shroud must have arrived in Constantinople some time during the period 30 AD and 1204 AD.  By the year 328, Helena had apparently ensured that Contantinople was apparently swamped with relics of the crucifixion, the early martyrs, and indeed according to Charles Freeman and his mentor John Calvin there was a whole shipload of True Crosses there.  Curiously, the Shroud is not included in any of the inventories of this largesse, so presumably it arrived there after 328 AD, \nLet us fast-forward to the year 943 AD.  The great Armenian general of the Byzantines John Curcuas with an army of 80,000, had turned the course of history by his military conquest of the Turks.  The Arabs had been weakened and here he is at the gates of Edessa which lie at his mercy together with a potentially utter defeat of the Muslims.  What would you do as a general?  Would you not press on and make the defeat complete?  What does Curcuas do? Why, he camps at the gate and negotiates over several months for some old icon, a piece of rag with a picture on it, or so we are told.  The Arabs are perplexed; the Caliph in Baghdad has to be consulted, and eventually the icon is surrendered.  \nNow there are two possible scenarios to consider.  Either the Byzantines already have the purported burial cloth, and this must be known by the Emperor and the Patriarch, or else they do not.  If they already have such a relic, together with Helena’s largesse, why would they ever send such a prestigious general with his army merely to capture some picture, when there was a much more lucrative prize on offer, the utter rout of the Arabs?  Very likely then, the burial cloth would have arrived in Constantinople some time after 943. \nThe Mandylion, as it is called, is brought to the Emperor, together with whatever else had been captured, with great ceremony, it is seen so prestigious that a special feast day on August 16 is declared for its arrival, still celebrated throughout Eastern Orthodoxy even today.  The Mandylion is made part of the Orthodox liturgy, and the legend of Abgar is recited. \nLet us now surmise that the Mandylion is not the Shroud, and therefore it arrives in Constantinople at some later date.  Surprisingly, I cannot tell you the feast day for the arrival of the burial cloths of Jesus Christ in Constantinople.  The Orthodox do not celebrate the arrival of such a prestigious relic.  Robert de Clari saw something very like it in 1204, and the Patriarch complained to the Pope that the Crusaders made off with it.  But of the arrival of teh burial cloths there is no mention. \nBut of course I shall be told that all of this is my over-wrought imagnation working overtime.  It couldn’t happen that way at all.

The legend associated with the Veil of Manoppello suggests that it may very well be the Veronica after its disappearance from Rome ~1608.  Whether it was in Edessa or not might be argued.  One version I read (Heinrich Pfeiffer) has it going from Jerusalem to Camelia in Capadocia, and thence to Constantinople in the VI c. whence it disappeared in 705.  The VI c. is suggestive I think, and may point to an Edessa provenance as many copies of Edessa image seem to have radiated from there at that time (Belting).  \nThe three alleged originals (Melkite, Nestorian, Monophysite) make it further confusing, as do the various names used at different times for a single object.  Byzantine chronicle says that Bishop Abraham only took the one object in 944 and returned the others, but that I suppose could be questioned. \nFor me a compelling argument is the 15 Vignon markings.  Whatever the original template (and perhaps its copies) that artists worked from happened to be, then the facial image on the Shroud must have been the model for those template(s).  As the copies radiated out from Edessa in the 6th century, I find it hard to dismiss the inevitable conclusion that the Shroud was in Edessa at that time.  It could no longer have been there when Edessa was destroyed in 1146.  \nAround 1130, Normandy-based Orderic Vitalis reports that western visitors to Constantinople are shown the emperor’s relic collection and that the Jesus-imprinted Edessa cloth, besides Jesus’ facial imprint displays ‘the form and size of the Lord’s body to all who look upon it’.

It seems that peer-review is not necessarily the guarantee of rigour that it once might have been. \nIf one were to wait for academe to take an interest in it, I think we should wait a very long time indeed.  There does appear in my view to be an academic conspiracy against the Shroud, based perhaps on faulty received wisdom.  It commenced with the reaction of the French Academy of Science to Delage and Vignon.  Sadly I have recently learned of the apparent intent to deceive by two notable cleric historians, Chevalier & Thurston.  If you are not already aware of it, I would refer you to Markwardt’s paper “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD” 2001.  It would seem that these two notable historians set about with a deliberate intent to deceive.  Markwardt is an attorney at law and understands these matters very well.  http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf   Chevalier & Thurston seem to have set an unfortunate precedent followed by some of their successors. I am sure that you would not willingly want to be such a participant yourself, but perhaps “caution” might be a good watchword. \nYou refer to neglect of any potential healing power of the Shroud.  That might well be true, but perhaps indicates that pro-authenticists are more cautious than you have assumed.  Albert Dreisbach has written extensively on its historic association with healing, most of them fairly ancient.  I found the last paper he wrote, shortly before his death in 2006 quite moving.  Although this paper does not specifically refer to healing, it certainly has a strong religious appeal which I hope you might be able to relate to.\n“THE ECUMENICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE SHROUD OF TURIN”; (Perugia: Revised 2006) by The Rev.

Their own presentation was itself fraudulent.  How pervasive it was is demonstrated by the frequency with which the D’Arcis memorandum continues to be quoted by hostile Shroud sceptics even today. \nYour curt dismissal of the Dreisbach paper demonstrates your failure to distinguish a paper with an honest religious intent from a paper intended for other papers, specifically history.

He was born after the mandylion / shroud arrived there.”\nI now think this is quite a significant point, and after looking into the matter further, I think this may change the odds considerably towards the cloth quite possibly being a representation of the Shroud. \nThe whole Ottonian period is a fascinating time for Europe, beginning with Otto I the Great. After securing the German Reich against various rival aspirants, Otto I was summoned to Italy by the Burgundian princess Adelaide, the widowed queen of Italy, married her and assumed the title of king of the Lombards. Having dealt with a Magyar uprising, he was summoned to Italy a second time, by Pope John XII, and was crowned as Emperor in 962.  He had by then procured the election of his 6 year old son Otto II as king of Germany. He extended the temporal power of the pope, but having deposed John XII in 963. obtained a proviso that the emperor was to ratify papal elections. \nTurning now to the marriage of Otto II with the Byzantine princess Theophanu in 972: She is not to be confused with Theophano, the widow of the incapable ruler Romanos II, son of Constantine Porphyrogenitus who had minted coins showing Shroud-like facial images of Christ. The Mandylion had arrived in Constantinople from Edessa in 944. In order to promote her sons as the hereditary rulers of Constantinople, Theophano subsequently married Nikephoros II Phokas and served as regent during her sons minority. Theophanu has been suggested as the fourth child of Theophano and Romanos II, but current research holds that her mother was Sophia Phokaina, niece of Nikephoros II. \nBe all that as it may, it suggests that Theophanu, wife of Otto II, and mother of Otto III would have been suffiently connected with the Byzantine court to appreciate the true nature of the imperial relic collection, whatever that might have comprised. Otto II was declared emperor upon Otto I’s death in 1973, himself dying in 983 while attempting to bring Venice under imperial control.    \nWhether Otto III was in a position to learn of the Shroud’s existence, or of its true significance, from his mother Theophanu, can only be a matter of conjecture, whether or not he knew of the cloth’s image.  However the question of whether or not the cloth in his coronation picture is intended to represent the Shroud, becomes I think just a little more plausible and tantalising.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2013 at 2:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/03/the-enthronement-of-otto-iii/","cat":"art","title":"The Enthronement of Otto III"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Despite its appearance, I’m inclined to doubt the object being a representation of the Shroud. Otto III was crowned Emperor in Rome in 996, when the Shroud would be virtually unknown as such in the West. He had planned to recreate the glory and power of the ancient Roman Empire in a universal Christian state governed from Rome, in which the pope would be subordinate to the Emperor in religious as well as secular affairs. Heeding an appeal from Pope John XV in suppressing a rebellion by the Roman noble Crescentius, Otto had crossed the Alps but by the time of his arrival in Rome, the pope had died. Otto then secured the election of his 23 year old cousin Bruno of Carinthia as Gregory V, the first German pope, who then crowned Otto as emperor. \nIn making Rome his official residence and administrative centre of the Empire, Otto instituted elaborate Byzantine court ceremonies, and revived ancient Roman customs, as well as assuming certain religious titles for himself. This may suggest some acquaintance with Byzantium, and hence the possibility of some knowledge of the Byzantine relics, but to link this with the Shroud would seem tenuous. \nGregory V died in 999, whereupon Otto installed his former tutor Gerbert of Aurillac pope, as Sylvester II. Sylvester a pre-eminent scholar, was every bit a match for Otto. He had been trained in Spain, and it was largely due to him whereby Arabic learning was transmitted to the West, including the first use of Hindu-Arabic numerals, an interesting enough subject in itself. Gerbert himself is a fascinating figure, being the foremost and dominating figure of the 10th century for modern scholars. Gerbert’s legacy includes his political roles; his teaching in logic, dialectics, mathematics and astronomy; his transmssion of Arabic learning; his relations with Otto III; his papacy; and his influence on later ages.\n\n","date":"August 3, 2013 at 5:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/03/the-enthronement-of-otto-iii/","cat":"art","title":"The Enthronement of Otto III"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max: “Manoppello Veil face (in my opinion the latter is the Holy Face of the Holy Mandylion and the Roman Veronica Sudarium II)”  \nIf you’re not already aware of it I suggest you check out comprehensive article: “The Veil of Manoppello: work of art or authentic relic?”  by Roberto Falcinelli, 2005.\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/roberto.pdf   \nExtract from ‘Conclusion’:  “I believe we are not talking about an acheropite image, but rather a 16th century painting, that the Veil of Manoppello is the very portrait given by Dürer to Raphael, as it is known in the bibliography and believed missing. … … As Vasari wrote, the painter received Dürer’s portrait as a gift after Raphael’s death.

Therefore some commentators believe it was probably the evangelist himself i.e. Mark.\nAuthors Jacobovici and Pellegrino have an interesting take on the incident, ref “The Jesus Family Tomb” Simcha Jacobovici & Charles Pellegrino – Harper Collins 2007.  It refers to the discovery of a family tomb in the suburb Talpiot where several ossuaries were found, all inscribed with names connected with Jesus family relations (Mk 6:3)\nThere are several references in various gospels, particularly John, referring to “the disciple whom Jesus loved”.  Most commentators believe this was the disciple John, some still identify as the evangelist of that name.  For example he leant on Jesus’ breast at the Last Supper.\nIn those days of high mortality, there were many orphans, adoption was very prevalent, and under both Roman and Jewish Law, adoption gave the same family rights as birth. (Even some of the emperors inherited the role through their adoption).\nPellegrino’s take on this is that the young man referred to in Mk 14:50, is Jesus’ adopted son (Jude?) and this was the “disciple whom Jesus loved”, leaning on his breast, and fleeing from the arrest in his pyjamas.  One ossuary has the name “Yehuda bar Yeshua”.  The adoption is never mentioned in the gospels because of the implied threat to the young man’s life as son of the “King of the Jews”.

Mark was Peter’s amenuensis in Rome, and so Peter was the guarantor of Mark’s authenticity.  The theory states that Mark wrote his gospel after Peter’s death 65AD, but before the temple was destroyed in 70AD.  Peter and Mark must have had some fascinating discussions in Rome, as Peter recalled his time with Jesus.  Peter no doubt described his experience on that first Easter morning.  He may even have mentioned his shock (possibly horror) at seeing a shroud with a naked imprint of his Master on it.  What could Mark do with a story like that?  Think about the psychology of it.

My comment was intended to convey that no way was the young man who was fleeing from the arrest scene the gardening boy doing shiftwork overtime, although many of our iwi here in Aotearoa may consider full-moon a propitious time for planting their kumara (sweet potato). Your comment re Magdalene’s mistaking Jesus for the gardener is fully understood.\nTo say that John & Mark are one and the same person is a gross assumption, these names were exceedingly common in the Judaic community, and we can seldom know that when they’re repeated if they refer to the same person elsewhere in the Testament unless they can be placed in the same context.\nFor example: we don’t know if John the disciple is the same as the evangelist (he may be), he’s probably not the writer of the Johannine epistles, and almost certainly not the writer of Revelations.  A few years ago, following up hostile reactions on the web to the “Jesus Family Tomb” book which I mentioned above in my posting of Feb 15, I did a stats analysis of the names known to be on 1st c ossuaries.  Most of the names familiar to us through the NT were exceedingly common.  It takes some fairly rigorous analysis and context cross-referencing to show that two separate occurrences of a name refer to the same person, and you still may not come up with the correct answer.\nI am utterly dismayed at Chris’s news of a growing tendency to reject Marcan priority.  It is so retrograde.  It is decorated with the name of following the Clementine tradition, asserting that this was the understanding of the early Fathers.  It can be traced back to Papias, a 2nd century bishop of Hierapolos in Phrygia, who Irenaeus says knew the apostle John, and who Eusebius says was a man of exceedingly small intelligence.  Subsequent Fathers are merely echoing Papias.  What Papias actually said was that “So Matthew composed the Oracles in the Hebrew language and each one interpreted them as he could.”  Now the Oracles may have been the “logia”, the “sayings” now common to Matthew and Luke, and possibly some of the common narrative, he may even have compiled the document called “Q”.  They almost certainly were not Matthew’s gospel as we now know it, as it seems plain enough that the original language of this Gospel was Greek, not Hebrew.  It is seriously doubted that the “Oracle” Matthew is the same as the “Gospel” Matthew (my note above re prevalence of NT names).\nFurthermore, the Anti-Marcan priority lobby is not averse to using form-criticism when it suits them, such as asserting that Mark deleted all the apparent anti-Gentile references in Matthew.  Either they should use the full weight of this discipline, or not at all.  I recall that a few bloggers on this site seem to have been prone to a similar disease, selecting only that evidence which suits their case, and rejecting that which does not!  So the condition is fairly prevalent, and probably contagious!\n\n","date":"February 17, 2012 at 5:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"OK Chris, we can agree to disagree.  One problem is that in Mark, it looks like the Temple has not yet been destroyed, whereas in Matthew & Luke it has.  Either way, Matthew & Luke certainly haven’t written before 70 AD.\nHere’s another theory, which takes on board both viewpoints!  One possibility is that Mark wrote his between 65 & 70, but maybe it was only circulated locally and didn’t receive wide circulation throughout the whole church.  Matthew & Luke had access to it together with other material, and compiled their gospels.  Matthew’s was theologically comprehensive, and envisaged Jesus as the new Moses.  Matthew’s was the gospel that was read in the churches, and is commonly called the ecclesiastical gospel.  So in that sense it had priority.  When Mark’s gospel became more widely known, it was seen as an abridgement of Matthew (90% of Mark is in Matthew), inferior, and so leading to the Clementine viewpoint.\nWhen does Jesus become Son of God?  In Mark, it is at his baptism by John B in the Jordan!  In Matthew and Luke, it is at his conception! In John, it is from the very beginning. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”.  so there’s a clear transition, from Mark, through Matthew & Luke, to John.\nIncidentally, looks like Max’s comments on “sindon” might support the pyjama theory, or maybe it was just somebody in bed at the time.  I doubt that gardeners would be at work in the middle of the night.

Those who follow the “form criticism” approach, almost universally adopt Markan Priority, and it makes a lot of rational sense.  Those who prefer the testimony of some of the early Church Fathers are those more inclined to adopt a Matthew, Luke priority, Mark as an abridgement, with John much later.  Having read some of the material on it, I don’t see how it stacks up.\nIt was with some dismay that I discovered that the translators of NASB without exception, were those who rejected the Markan Priority thesis.  While there might have been some need to allow a non-Markan priority viewpoint, it seems to have been a highly selective bias, considering what the majority exegete viewpoint is.  I detect an ultraconservative reactionary conspiracy at work!\n\n","date":"February 16, 2012 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Re prevalence of NT names in 1st c Judea, as recorded on inscribed ossuaries.\nAn authoritative paper can be found at: http://www.uhl.ac/JudeanTombsAndOssuaries.html\nNote that I do not necessarily agree with the fundamental conclusion of this paper, as I believe the author(s) have failed to calculate the true random probability of all the names occurring at Talpiot in the one tomb, which is very much smaller than they seem prepared to admit.\nFrom a population of 917 ossuaries, 686 were not inscribed; There were 286 names found on 231 inscribed ossuaries (e.g. X son of Y).\nHere’s a small sample of name frequencies (which includes their variants):\nSalome 26; Simon 26; Mary 20; Joseph 19; Judas 18; John 12; Martha 11; Jesus 10; Matthew 8 … …\nYou can check the paper for the full list.

Very many years ago in the 1950’s, I regularly topped my classes in French (and Latin), but purely on the basis of my meccano set (a well-known model building set) my parents decided I should take up professional engineering instead.  I’m afraid I’ve lost most of my French now and have lacked the incentive to take it up again.  In later life I was able to take up my interests in literary studies and mathematics, which also happened to include a major in Religious Studies.  I made some attempt to pick up on the works you mentioned, but I’m afraid that Google automatic French-English translation of technical papers is only slightly better than pidgin.\nI regularly use my Encyclopaedia Britannica package as one of my reference sources.  It has an extremely comprehensive in-depth section on Biblical Literature, compiled by several authoritative authors.  I also of course use several other sources as well.\nI also mentioned the ability of non-literate peoples to recite long passages they had heard, purely from memory.  This is still manifest among both Maori and Pasifika peoples for instance in reciting their whakapapa (genealogies) karakia (chants) and so on, which they have had from ancient times.  You may recall a related passage from Alex Haley’s “Roots” which takes him to his ancestral tribe in Africa, and the tribal genealogist recites the genealogy enabling Haley to discover his ancestor who had been taken by slave traders.\nI think we see a glimpse of this practice of oral recitation in Papias:\n“Papias (died c. 130), a bishop of Hieropolis, in Asia Minor, was said by Irenaeus (died c. 200), a bishop of Lugdunum (now Lyon, France) to have been an eyewitness of the Apostle John. Papias had said, “For I did not suppose that the things from the books would aid me so much as the things from the living and continuing voice.”\nEusebius (c. 260-c. 340), a church historian, reported these comments in his Ecclesiastical History and pointed out inconsistencies in Papias’ recollections, doubted his understanding, and called him “a man of exceedingly small intelligence.” Large sections of oral tradition, however, which were probably translated in part from Aramaic before being written down in Greek-such as the Passion (suffering of Christ) narrative, many sayings of Jesus, and early liturgical material-benefited by the very conservatism implicit in such traditions.” (Encyc Brit)\nI think it suggests that oral recitation in the early churches may well have been a norm.  It is also reflected in the pericope style of the Synoptics, with their self-contained mini-episodic style of writing.\nCertainly in the time of Papias, both Matthew’s and Mark’s gospels were accepted as authentic witnesses.  And of course by the mid-2nd c. we have Justin in Rome reporting in his Apologia: “And on the day called Sunday there is a meeting in one place of those who live in the city or the country, and the memoirs of the apostles or writings of the prophets are read as long as time permits.”  “… the memoirs of the apostles which are called Gospels …”  It seems that Justin feels the need to take pains in explaining this practice of reading the memoirs.\nI’m therefore of the view that the written Word was something that evolved rather more slowly than is allowed by some exegetes who see it as a more immediate development.\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"At Max’s behest, I have been doing some further research on the matter, and I am impressed by the comprehensive entries on the Catholic Encyclopaedia web-site for the gospels of Matthew and Mark. I urge both Max & Ron to examine these, as they cover the various arguments and issues in a way not possible in a short blog posting.\nGospel of Matthew: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10057a.htm\nGospel of Mark: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09674b.htm\nI do not subscribe to the views of Robinson, Trestmontant and Carmignac.  Theirs is not the majority viewpoint of exegetes, and I think it unfortunate that they seem to have gained traction within the establishment.\nOn the evidence of Papias, Mark did not use Matthew as a source, but reported what he had directly from Peter in Rome.  He has written it for Roman Christians, many of them gentiles, although some were Jews.  Matthew wrote his gospel for Syriac Christians, and it is evident that they are predominantly Jewish Christians, and likewise Jewish synagogues are also prevalent, probably as a result of the dispersion with the impending  threat of the Jewish War.\nThe source of Matthean priority seems to have been due to a misreading of Papias, who states that Matthew first wrote “logia” in the Hebrew language, (possibly the ‘Q’ document).  This is covered in the references above.  Only two of Mark’s miracle stories are not included in Matthew and Luke.\nThe view I am coming to about the origin of the priority debate is along the following lines:  Mark wrote his gospel, from the preaching of Peter, and it had limited circulation among Roman Christians.  At some time Matthew and Luke acquired copies of it, and along with other material they had, compiled their gospels.  Matthew’s gospel came to be read in the Syriac churches, was referred to as the ecclesiastical gospel, and in that sense had priority.  When Mark’s gospel became more widely known, it was seen as inferior to Matthew’s, and an abridgement of it (90% of Mark is in Matthew), and therefore secondary.\nI do not subscribe to the view that there were early apostle-scribes who wrote everything down.  There is no evidence for such scribes, although someone called Matthew appears to have written down the logia (Q?).  The parousia was believed to be imminent and so there would be little point in writing for posterity in the years before 70 AD. I suspect that the assumption arises from a modern Western lack of appreciation of the ability of non-literate peoples to recite verbatim what they had heard, and there were many others who would correct them if they made an error of recall.\nConcerning the dates of writing, I can certainly concede there is wide-spread lack of agreement among the authorities.  The arguments for a post-70 AD date for the composition of Matthew is an extract at the foot of this posting.\nExtract concerning the origins of Mark’s gospel is reproduced below:\nEusebius quoting Papias: “And the elder said this also: Mark, having become interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately everything that he remembered, without, however, recording in order what was either said or done by Christ. For neither did he hear the Lord, nor did he follow Him, but afterwards, as I said, (he attended) Peter, who adapted his instructions to the needs (of his hearers), but had no design of giving a connected account of the Lord’s oracles [v. l. “words”]. So then Mark made no mistake [Schmiedel, “committed no fault”], while he thus wrote down some things (enia as he remembered them; for he made it his one care not to omit anything that he had heard, or set down any false statement therein” (Eusebius, Church History III.39).\nExtract of arguments concerning Matthew’s post-70 AD date of composition:\nThe following are some of the arguments advanced to prove that the First Gospel was written several years after the Fall of Jerusalem. When Jesus prophesies to His Apostles that they will be delivered up to the councils, scourged in the synagogues, brought before governors and kings for His sake; that they will give testimony of Him, will for Him be hated and driven from city to city (x, 17-23) and when He commissions them to teach all nations and make them His disciples, His words intimate, it is claimed, the lapse of many years, the establishment of the Christian Church in distant parts, and its cruel persecution by the Jews and even by Roman emperors and governors. Moreover, certain sayings of the Lord–such as: “Thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church” (16:18), “If he [thy brother] will not hear them: tell the Church” (xviii, 10)–carry us to a time when the Christian Church was already constituted, a time that could not have been much earlier than the year 100. The fact is, that what was predicted by Our Lord, when He announced future events and established the charter and foundations of His Church, is converted into reality and made coexistent with the writing of the First Gospel. Hence, to give these arguments a probatory value it would be necessary either to deny Christ’s knowledge of the future or to maintain that the teachings embodied in the First Gospel were not authentic.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2012 at 6:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Because I’m not a biblical ltieralist!\nI believe caution must be exercised in interpreting every line of scripture.\nA common enough error is to assume that every line of scripture is literally true, probably stemming from the traditional doctrine that all of scripture is divinely inspired.  A broader view is evident as early as the time of Augustine (De doctrina christiana): “Its emphasis on allegorical interpretation of scripture, carried out within very loose parameters, was especially significant, and it remains of interest to philosophers for its subtle and influential discussion of Augustine’s theory of “signs” and how language represents reality.” (Encyc Brit),\nThe evangelists were not concerned to write history, as we understand a historian might do today, or even in the style of Josephus say.  They were generally concerned to proclaim Jesus as divine, as Saviour, to proclaim his teaching, and, in John, as Son of God from the very beginning.  They did this according to their own understanding, and according to their perceived needs of their intended congregations.  Notwithstanding, the gospels certainly do have some historical content.\nJohn is certainly concerned with Jewish practices, his intended audience appears for the most part to be Jewish Christians, his gospel seems to be structured around Jewish festivals, and there is further doctrinal development from the content of the Synoptics.  But it is not possible for instance, as John P Meier has pointed out (A Marginal Jew) to obtain a time-frame consistent with the Synoptics, John’s time span is much longer,  Even so it is John’s account that Meier uses for dating the crucifixion.  There was some initial reluctance to accept John’s gospel as canonical, and a few even suspected it of some gnosticism.\nIt may well have been the intention of Nicodemus and Joseph Ar. to comply with all the detailed requirements of the prescribed burial rites, but there may well have been a few details they had to omit in the time available.  Do we suppose that John would make a point of mentioning any omission if such was the case?  It’s irrelevant to his preaching of the kerygma.\nI think there is scope for both points of view, but I can’t see that one can be dogmatic about either.\nAs my scholarly Augustinian Assumptionist Bible instructor is fond of saying about legitimate competing viewpoints: “Yer pays yer money, and yer makes yer choice!”\n\n","date":"February 20, 2012 at 11:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I don’t see that anti-Semitism is an essential ingredient to German rationalist exegesis.

You have given a persuasive argument for it in the Sanhedrin roles of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, providing that there was sufficient light still available for them to observe all the detail of these rituals.\nThere’s some interesting recent comments on this site about myrrhic and aloetic residues on the blog headed by Kelly Pearse’s fine article.  I would go as far as saying that any exegete who fails to take due account of Jewish ritual practices runs the risk of being incompetent.

Perhaps such attempts should also be informed by allowing for the full detail of the halakhic burial rites, or at least possible variants of them.\n\n","date":"February 19, 2012 at 11:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Typo in first line: “Because I’m not a biblical literalist!”\n\n","date":"February 20, 2012 at 11:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/15/the-shroud-of-turin-a-pale-shadow-of-its-former-glory/","cat":"art","title":"The Shroud of Turin: a pale shadow of its former glory?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Off-topic: I’m working on a presentation for my local U3A group.

Text of Markwardt’s ‘Modern Scholarship’ paper is published by Barrie Schwortz at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf .  It comprises some 276 pages, double-spaced, with 251 footnotes, and 20 illustrations taken from his 136 slide-presentation.   It includes a detailed review of various other hypotheses, including the Wilson Mandylion theory, which Markwardt no longer holds.  \nTwo of his earlier papers, place the Shroud in the city of Antioch, taken there by the apostles consequential to the Jewish persecution after the martyrdom of Stephen.  During the depredations and confiscation of church treasures by Julian the Apostate, it was hidden away until the 6th century when a series of earthquakes hit Antioch, and its location was then revealed.  Soon after Antioch was attacked by the Persian King Chosroes who destroyed the city.  Meantime the warrior patriarch bishop of Antioch, Ephraemius took the Shroud into Cappadocia, where it became known as the Image of Camuliana.  Soon afterwards it was taken to the capital Constantinople, where it became known as the Image of God Incarnate, quite distinct from the Mandylion,  \nThis very brief summary does little justice to Markwardt’s excellent case, and one needs to read the paper to see his strong arguments for his theory.  I consider the paper to be a major landmark in the quest for an early history.  However there is a lot of scholarly investment in the Mandylion hypothesis, and I expect it will be some time before the significance of Markardt’s paper becomes fully appreciated. \nThe truth is often more fascinating and intriguing than any fictional account, however imaginative such speculations might be.\n\n","date":"February 4, 2015 at 2:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/04/tweeted-picture-of-the-day-black-madonna-and-the-shroud/","cat":"art","title":"Tweeted Picture of the Day:  Black Madonna and the Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I believe the method outlined by Mr Farey is flawed, and there are better images available than that shown on Shroudscope, valuable as that tool happens to be.  Firstly only the exit wound of one nail hole of the left upper limb is shown, it is smeared, and no entrance wounds are visible.  The length of phalanges between individuals is known to vary considerably;  there is an underlying assumption that the outer surface of the hand is laying flat against the cloth, whereas it seems more likely to be an orthogonal projection, and for all that may be surmised, the fingers may be cupped to some extent, and also not parallel to the cloth;  there is an assumption that the image of the ends of the fingers are clearly visible, but for all that may be guessed the end of the fingers image may merely be the end of the phalange bones, if that.  I believe the measurement method described is therefore flawed. \nI have before me a particularly clear image of the exit wound.  It appears to coincide with the narrowest part of the wrist, where the base of the thumb and little-finger metacarpals converge at the join of the wrist.  The “blood-smear” extends from the base of the palm as far as and beyond the join with the fore-arm, that is, generally what most people would call the wrist.  \nAs for the entrance wound, that is not visible.  Barbet deduced from his experiments, that it was at the wrist.  Zugibe considered it was at the base of the palm, and showed a particularly graphic example of a stabbing victim’s wound which he believed was similar.  I believe Zugibe’s analysis of arm tensions was flawed, as it failed to take account of the fact of the raising of the cross-beam, with the victim attached, when the full body weight would need to be carried by his outstretched arms, until the feet were nailed which only then could give any relief to arm tension.\n\n","date":"February 23, 2015 at 5:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/22/very-disturbing/","cat":"art","title":"Very Disturbing"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"HF: “Sampath: I have attempted to explain why the nail wound of the Shroud man is not in the wrist at: http://i.imgur.com/LH4rmE9.jpg.

This might argue for a decisive influence from within the earth, such as radon gas. That it is not a perfect image might argue against it being miraculous.

It looks too much like pseudo-science and also too much like pseudo-theology.  It remains untestable, and to conceive it as part of the resurrection process strains my credulity.   \nNevertheless a source of atomic particles as a result of radioactive decay is available, and which might add some credibility to their skewing of the date.  All four gospel accounts relate the occurrence of an earthquake.  John’s gospel takes it further than the synoptics and attributes an aftershock to the moving of the stone set and sealed into the tomb entrance on the instructions of Pilate at the instigation of the Jewish priests.  That all four gospels mention an earthquake suggests to me that it was more than a mere literary device but was in fact a real occurrence.  \nSince about 1980, 222Rn has been identified as a significant cause of background radiation.  It accounts for most of the exposure from background radiation, and is considered the most serious cause of lung cancer among non-smokers, particularly for those living in enclosed spaces of lower floors of apartment buildings.  It has a half life of 3.28 days.  Radon is apparently the only known radioactive gas, and the health risk arises because the daughter products of the decay process are solid particulates, mostly isotopes in the lead chain.  \n222Rn is a daughter product of the decay of radium, itself a daughter product of the decay of uranium.  It is released from within the ground during earthquakes, and has been investigated as a possible precursor of earthquakes.    \nI have a question for Bob Rucker.  Can he envisage that 222Rn released from within the tomb as a result of an earthquake might produce the effects that he postulates may have occurred as a result of neutron emission?  I respectfully suggest that pursuit of this origin of atomic particles might yield a more scientific basis for his theory.

The elementary structural unit of all porphyrins is a large ring itself composed of four pyrrole rings, or cyclic tetrapyrroles. This basic compound is known as porphin.\nPorphyrins combine with metals (metalloporphyrins) and protein. They are represented by the green, photosynthetic chlorophylls of higher plants and by the hemoglobins in the blood of many animals.\nPorphyrins:\nMany invertebrates display in their skins or shells porphyrin pigments (or salts of them), some showing fluorescence (i.e., the emission of visible light during exposure to outside radiation). In addition, various porphyrins occur in secretory and excretory products of animals, and some kinds, predominantly the phorbides, which result from the breakdown of chlorophyll, have been recovered from ancient natural deposits such as coal and petroleum and from muds of long-buried marine and lacustrine strata. Ooporphyrin is responsible for the red flecks on the eggshells of some plovers and many other birds. The African turacos (Musophagidae) secrete a copper salt of uroporphyrin III into their wing feathers. This deep-red pigment, turacin, is readily leached from the feathers by water containing even traces of alkali. The green plumes of these birds owe their colour to the presence of turacoverdin, a derivative of turacin. \nHemoglobins:\nHemoglobins are present in the red blood cells of all vertebrate animals and in the circulatory fluids of many invertebrates, notably annelid worms, some arthropods, echinoderms, and a few mollusks. The hemoglobin molecule consists of a heme fraction and a globin fraction; the former consists of four pyrrole moieties (porphin) with a ferrous iron (Fe2+) atom in the centre. The globin fraction is a protein that may constitute more than 90 percent of the total molecular weight of hemoglobin. Hemoglobins have the capacity to combine with atmospheric oxygen in lungs, gills, or other respiratory surfaces of the body and to release oxygen to tissues. They are responsible for the pink to red colours observed in combs and wattles of birds and in the skin of humans and other primates. Particularly prominent are portions of the face, buttocks, and genital areas of baboons. \nChlorophylls:\nChlorophyll is one of the most important pigments in nature. Through the process of photosynthesis, it is capable of channeling the radiant energy of sunlight into the chemical energy of organic carbon compounds in the cell. For a detailed account of this process, see photosynthesis. A pigment very much like chlorophyll was probably the first step in the evolution of self-sustaining life. Chlorophyll exists in several forms. Chlorophylls a and b are the chief forms in higher plants and green algae; bacteriochlorophyll is found in certain photosynthetic bacteria.\nThe chlorophylls are magnesium porphyrin compounds in which a cyclic tetrapyrrole is attached to a single central magnesium atom. They contain two more hydrogen atoms than do other porphyrins. The various forms differ in minor modifications of side groups attached to the pyrrole groups. In higher plants, chlorophyll is bound to proteins and lipids aschloroplastin in definite and specific laminations in bodies called chloroplasts. The combination of chlorophyll with protein in chloroplastin is of special significance, because only as a result of the combination is chlorophyll able to remain resistant to light.\nBilins:\nAmong the metabolic products of certain porphyrins, including the heme portion of hemoglobin, is a series of yellow, green, red, or brown nonmetallic compounds arranged as linear, or chain, structures rather than in the cyclic configuration of porphyrins. These are the so-called bilins, or bilichromes. Small quantities of the red waste compound, bilirubin (C33H36O6N4); a green product formed from it by the removal of two hydrogen atoms, biliverdin (C33H34O6N4); and various other chemically similar compounds occur in normal tissues and may be conspicuous in excretory or secretory materials under normal circumstances and certain pathological conditions. The bile pigments, although first identified in mammalian tissues or products (e.g., in the bile of the gall bladder), are by no means confined thereto. Various members of the bilichrome series are encountered in invertebrates, lower vertebrates, and in red algae and green plants.\nAlthough the bile pigments of animals arise in all probability from the catabolism of heme precursors, there is evidence that bilirubin, accompanied by iron salts, promotes the synthesis of new hemoglobin when injected into humans, dogs, or rabbits suffering from secondary anemia.    Etc, etc, etc …. …. \nI would conclude that chlorophyll comprises porphyrins attached to a Magnesium atom.  Hemoglobin comprises porphins attached to an Iron atom.  Bilins are non-metallic porphyrins.\n\n","date":"May 27, 2015 at 3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/27/colin-berry-is-not-seeing-red/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Colin Berry is not Seeing Red"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I should think that if I were in the position of Dr Freeman, I should be concerned at the likely adverse effect on my professional reputation than “to publish in a recognised specialist textile journal”, an hypothesis which so contradicts what is scientifically known about the nature of the image, a superficial oxidation limited to the crowns of the threads, reducible by diimide, the absence of any signs of painting whatsoever, a realistic image of a human corpse which lacks any artistic precursor, with no evidence of any similar artifact, and an hypothesis which lacks the slightest support of any scientific corroboration and lacking any intent to research the same.\n\n","date":"May 28, 2015 at 7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/27/colin-berry-is-not-seeing-red/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Colin Berry is not Seeing Red"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think it’s fair to say that most of the popes were all men of their age and attempted to deal with the problems of the universal church of their time as best they could.

However that is not to say that everything a pope has to say on any such matter is necessarily infallible. \nI have before me from my youth an old battered soft-cover copy of “The Papal Encyclicals in their Historical Context” written by Anne Fremantle in 1958, which I still value for its content.  In the early 1900s, sound doctrine was in peril as a result of a movement within the Church which sought to follow the extremes of a certain German Protestant trend which saw much of the New Testament as mythology.  Certainly there is mythical content there, but Christianity is founded on definite historical events, centred on the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and its saving power for humanity.  The response of Pius X was to issue his encyclical “Pascendi Dominici Gregis” in Sept 1907, condemning what he called “Modernism” and which included a list of proscribed propositions.  Reviewing Pascendi now in the 21st century, a few of these propositions now appear quaint, of no great moment, and seem to be from another age which has now passed.    \nThe reforms of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, which sought to make the Church more relevant to its presence in the world, seemed to pose a threat to those of an ultra-conservative mind, who sought to freeze the expression of belief and practice in a single moment of time, that which prevailed from a past age.  Out of this we saw such movements as the St Pius X society, the Lefebvre movement, a dogmatic attachment to the old Tridentine rite, a refusal to acknowledge the validity of any subsequent popes, and various other signs, which saw any advance from the 1900s as pure heresy.  \nThus Donald Sanborne condemns Pope Benedict XVI as a modernist, disrespectfully calling him “Ratzinger” with little acknowledgement of his proper religious title.  It is a nasty little piece of polemical writing.  This is notwithstanding that many of us can recall Cardinal Ratzinger in his role as head of a doctrinal congregation as seemingly extremely conservative in his care for sound doctrine, as demonstrated in his treatment of such writers as Hans Kung for instance.  As Pope Benedict XVI, he reached out to those who had fallen away under the Lefebvre spell, and sought to reincorporate them into the universal church.  Small thanks he had for it if we are to judge from such writings as those of Donald Sanborne, who would seem to prefer a church confined to the irrelevance of a past age, with no real witness for Christ in the present world.\n\n","date":"May 29, 2015 at 3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/27/colin-berry-is-not-seeing-red/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Colin Berry is not Seeing Red"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin is only able to fire his arrows because there has been little in the way of a formal scientific programme on the Shroud since 1978, some 34 years.

I had somehow in my mind associated Matt 22:17-21 as a sort of temple tax paid as a tribute to Caesar, which was way off the mark. One of the sources I’ve now checked explains the rabbinic rationalisation of using the Baal inscribed Tyrian silver piece for the temple tax that it was 97% silver whereas the Roman coinage was only 80%; They apparently considered it more important that the correct amount of silver be paid to the temple rather than the prohibition of such an image as Baal. When the Romans closed the Tyrian mint, it was a Jewish mint near Jerusalem that then minted these coins. The Romans did not want to allow an impression of Jewish independence to be created by lettng them mint specifically Jewish coins, and as the Baal coins were acceptable before, that design had to stand. \nThe purpose of the money changers was for the exchange of common coinage for the temple coins.

Hugh Farey gives a very good explanation of why this is so. See the posting “Top of Head Puzzle” of 16 January and his Comment #15 there. Hugh writes: \n“Assuming that the bottom edges of the line of bloodstains along the back of the head correspond roughly to the level of the inion of the external occipital protuberance, there is a distance of about 38cm between there and the bridge of the nose, which corresponds well to the same distance on my own head. In other words, the image which is visible is consistent with a cloth wrapped tightly over the head from nose to occipital protuberance, and possibly a cloth about 15cm wide underneath the shroud and tied around the top of the head to account for the lack of image all the way.” \nI calculate that for there to be a gap of at least 3.7cm, the ventral and dorsal images must be separated by not less than an additional 6cm, which would be easily detected on the Shroudscope images.  The measurements and calculations would be well within cartographer Yannick’s ability to confirm. Hint: Assume the path over the head approximates to a semi-ellipse. Then for an additional gap of distance ‘h’ at the top of the head, the formula for the additional separation approximates to pi x h / 2.  Additional hint: Two bands encircle the globe at the equator; the second band is placed at a distance 1m above the first. What is the difference in length of the two bands? Answer – 6.28m. \nThe absence of an image at the top of the head can only be explained by an intervening cloth such as a type of cap – check Cap of Cahors!\n\n","date":"March 5, 2014 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh, I like the idea of the “double superficiality, as it fitted in rather neatly with his evaporation gradient hypothesis.” It makes quite a bit of sense to me.

I see it in NZ all the time, with various ethnic practices migrating into other cultures. I know families of European ethnicity who after the birth of a child will imitate the Maori practice of burying the after-birth sac and plant a tree over it; the tree becomes the child’s own special tree. \nHere’s a variation which you may have come across when in the Middle East.  A lady acquaintance with family working in Arabia, claims that the original purpose in wearing the burkha was to protect the eyes from desert sand-storms. The practice was retained even when families migrated away from desert environments, so that it became a cultural practice.  Finally, of course it became a religious obligation. I have no idea whether her story has factual substance or not, or whether you are able to corroborate it, but it certainly seems plausible. Back in the 1970s, the psychologist Eric Berne was asserting that many such social rituals, frequently had once served a useful practical purpose, but subsequently had merely become ritualised.  \nWe have 3rd and 4th century sources that asserted that the spreading of altar cloths were intended to represent Christ’s burial cloths.  As a eucharistic minister I am required to lay out a corporal cloth on the altar before Mass.  I am sure that I would be one of the very few ministers aware of the alleged origins of this practice.

It seems that the first suggestion of a pleural effusion was made in a hostile pamphlet “La folie de Jesus’ which Barbet despised and would not even give the author’s name.  It set out to prove that Jesus was of unsound mind and was tubercular, which goes against his apparently robust stamina and the active life he led.  However it was also suggested by a colleague who Barbet respected, Dr Rene Morlot, but Barbet does not accept his views on the matter.  \nBarbet himself conducted various experiments simulating the lancea wound, and was able to draw off significant quantities of pericardial fluid by aiming at the right auricle – the ventricles would be empty of blood.  He deduces that as the blow to the heart from the right was always mortal it was very likely taught in the Roman fencing schools, as the left side was usually protected by a shield.  This would then argue against the pleural effusion theory, as the wound would be too high and it would require too much fluid in the lungs of a normally healthy person for it to have been the source of the flow of “water”.     \nInterpreting the Johannine text in a symbolic way only, goes against the very strong emphasis John gives as it being a real event.  It is certain that the various writers seeing it in this way knew little or nothing  of anatomy, were confused about it, considered that blood could not flow in a corpse, and were desperate in reaching for an explanation.  Barbet limits himself to quoting St Jerome: “”This double flow conescrates at the same time the Baptism of water and the Baptism of blood of the martyr.”  But for Barbet, it was a real anatomical phenomenon which he had tested and proved. \nConcerning the authorship of John’s gospel, the following paragraphs are quoted from Encyclopedia Britannica:\n“Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown.”\n“Because both external and internal evidence are doubtful, a working hypothesis is that John and the Johannine letters were written and edited somewhere in the East (perhaps Ephesus) as the product of a “school,” or Johannine circle, at the end of the 1st century. The addressees were Gentile Christians, but there is accurate knowledge and much reference to Palestine, which might be a reflection of early Gospel tradition.”  \nThe insistence of John 19:34 as to the flow of blood and water being an eye witness account, must surely support these verses as being part of this “early Gospel tradition”.\n\n","date":"December 26, 2012 at 10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/26/getting-the-left-and-the-right-right/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Getting the Left and the Right Right"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I get the impression that Hugh is allowing his assumed skepticism to get the better of him.

The fellow in the video standing on a pedestal with near-horizontal arms, is hardly an accurate enactment. \nFor Kelly: It is Barbet’s contention that the patibulum was removed from the stipes, and the patibulum with body attached was then transported to the burial site where the nails would have been removed.

I also note an appended comment by Thaddeus Trenn who teaches in the science and religion program, Victoria College, University of Toronto:- \n“She is correct that a lens would reverse left and right. The cloth original was not dependent upon any lens since the image pixels were the result of direct impact from object to cloth. While her observation is very valuable at excluding the sort of photography Leonardo allegedly conducted, the image on the cloth is like a photographic negative in the light/dark reversal effect. One only needs to compare the negative of the cloth image with the photographic positive of this negative to see the left-right reversal. So the positive becomes the left/right corrective, returning the side wound to the right side as on the cloth.” \nI am now looking at two illustrations in Ian Wilson’s “The Turin Shroud”, ‘Shroud positive, frontal aspect after Enrie’, ‘Shroud negative, frontal aspect, after Enrie’.

On the positive print, both images appear on the page left of centre;  On the negative, these are reversed and both appear on the page right of centre.  Looking at the negative as if it were a print we would say that the wrist wound is on the left wrist, and that the forehead blood stain is above the left eyebrow.  In all the literature I’ve read, it is on the left wrist that the wound is clearly visible.  \nBarbet himself is insistent that the wound in the side is on the TS man’s right side, and obviously considers that the Shroud negative shows the correct orientation in direct view without the aid of a mirror as postulated by Sue Benford.  I would have rather more faith in Dr Barbet’s forensics than in Ms Benford’s claims.  I find in close analysis, the comment on orientation by Thaddeus Trenn somewhat ambiguous.

But one attitude that cannot be legitmately adopted, is dogmatic assertion.  There is simply insufficient evidence.  And that is unlikely to change in the very near future, because any further access to the Shroud for any further testing is unlikely to be permitted.  The only progress that can now be made is further examination, analysis and interpretation of data that is already available.  No further data or testing is going to happen any time soon.  And furthermore, it seems very likely that despite all the testing that has been carried out, this seems unlikely to yield any new definitive information.  \nYannick may if he so chooses, refuse to believe that the image was caused by the Resurrection.  But this cannot be domatically rejected by the evidence.  A major problem for any rational explanation in my view arises from: 1) The image is projected orthogonally on to the cloth and there are no images from the lateral aspect (side view); 2) The high resolution of the image.  Both of these properties seem to rule out any kind of gaseous diffusion as being the primary cause of the image, but the gases may be conjectured as providing a secondary vehicle allowing the image to be transferred.  \nThe orthogonality of the image is strongly suggestive of some kind of directional mechanism.  I think this may explain why some of the papers offered, look to such possible sources as neutron or proton exchange, either emanating from the body itself (Resurrection?) or release caused by a physical phenomenon such as earthquake or lighting.  And whether we like it or not, this begins to enter the realm of the conjectural. \nOne of the papers referring to possible earthquake source, suggests a Richter 9 earthquake.  This is an absolutely devastating earthquake at any depth at all typical, and the historic evidence for this is scant.  Giovanna De Liso succeeded in getting high resolution images with 3D properties at quite moderate levels of seismic activity.  Christchurch NZ is still recovering some 18 months after a shallow Force 5 earthquake, with many buildings still being demolished as unsafe, and rebuilding is still in its early stages.

It would depend on how the cloth was draped.  In earlier postings, Max Patrick Hamon had asserted that the body was completely wrapped, on the basis that the customary rites were completed.  Others have suggested that the cloth was merely draped over the body, possibly supported at the sides by the 100 lb package brought by Nicodemus.  Still another version has it that if it occurred during the moment of Resurrection, with both the body and the cloth hovering horizontally, suggested by the apparent weightlessness visible on the dorsal image (no dorsal deformation apparent).  For their 3D VP8 simulation calibration, Jumper and Jackson had the cloth lightly draped over.their model.  \nThe point I guess I was attempting to make, was that superficially the image is what we would expect to see in an ordinary 2-D photograph, with none of the body’s sides showing on the image, not even indistinctly.  For me, this seems to be a fairly compelling argument that gaseous diffusion could not be the primary cause of the image.  The boundaries at the edges of the image are reasonably sharp.  There is no sign of wrap-around.  \nGabriel’s comment at #25, ” issue of the unique correspondence between each point on the body and on the image” (not a pdf), also implies high resolution, but needs the qualifier that there are no corresponding points from the sides of the body.  \nTo me it’s starting to look like high energy particles, or a form of radiant energy.  I think that direct contact has to be ruled out because of the apparent 3D properties.\n\n","date":"August 7, 2012 at 5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/05/giulio-fanti-responds-are-you-listening-yannick-and-colin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds.

Despite some of Wilson’s faulty research, I believe he has done more than most others to RAISE AN AWARENESS OF THE SHROUD within the English speaking world.  In 1960, I attended a presentation given by our Domincan university chaplain to students at our Engineering School hostel.  This was my first real exposure to some of the forensic aspects of the Shroud, and I guess that much of it was probably based on the work of Pierre Barbet and other early pioneers.  At the time, I mentally filed it away and thought little more about it.  However until I encountered Ian Wilson’s 1978 book on the Shroud, I had never heard of Yves Delage, Paul Vignon, Max Frei’s pollen sampling, the historical aspects involving the De Charnay family, the challenge of the D’Arcis memorandum, and I was ignorant of the Crusaders’ sacking of Constantinople in 1204. I had certainly never heard of the Image of Edessa, and the legends concerning Abgar the Great. I was unaware of the detailed work carried out by the STURP team.  A significant contribution that Wilson himself made at this time was to publicise the many similarities to the Shroud facial image of post-6th century icons, coinage images, and the emergence of the Shroud-like Lamentation scenes such as those in the Pray manuscript. The English-speaking world was largely unaware of many of these aspects, but Wilson’s highly publicised work, which also emerged in paper-back, rectified this large-scale ignorance. Certainly there was an elite that knew a great deal more, but it seems only to have been confined to the enthusuastic few “in the know”. \nClearly, from Charles’ and O.K’s comments above there is a great deal more yet to come to public attention among us Anglophones, such as the various relics mentioned above.  They are certain to remain unknown until such time as another Wilson arises to take the same time, patience, labour and effort to bring them to a more common acquaintance. The world is much larger than the regrettably mutually unknown and diverse mother tongues confined to local pockets in Old Europe, and yet the various forms of English are now the most universal and common means of language communication in the Western World, and so these important aspects will continue to remain largely unfamiliar and unrecognised.\n\n","date":"August 24, 2013 at 5:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I’m sorry, I find her explanation contradictory and confusing, and I know I’m not dyslexic.

In 1813 it was named after György Pray, who discovered it in 1770. It is the first known example of continuous prose text in Hungarian. The Codex is kept in the National Széchényi Library of Budapest.”\n“One of the most prominent documents within the Codex (f.154a) is the Funeral Sermon and Prayer (Hungarian: Halotti beszéd és könyörgés). It is an old handwritten Hungarian text dating to 1192-1195. Its importance of the Funeral Sermon comes from that it is the oldest surviving Hungarian, and Uralic, text.”\n“The Codex also features a missal, an Easter mystery play, songs with musical notation, laws from the time of Coloman of Hungary and the annals, which list the Hungarian kings.”\nYou’ll need to research further for any more detailed info.\nBriefly, Hungary came into existence in the late 9th century, when Finno-Ugaritic Magyars occupied the middle basin of the Danube. The structure was essentially tribal governed by various warring princes. with raids across Europe. Both the Eastern and Western churches strove to draw them into their orbit. Their raiding efforts suffered severe reverses under the German king Otto I in 955, and the Magyars began to be influenced by Christianity. Embassies were sent to Holy Roman Eemperor Otto II, and in 975 Magyar leaders were received into the Western Church. Stephen I applied to Pope Sylvester II for royal insignia, and according to tradition was crowned king on Christmas Day 1000. This was yet another one of the marvellous achievements of the Ottonians and Pope Sylvester II. \nI would surmise that the Pray Manuscript was intended as some kind of handbook for use in meditation and worship in the Hungarian language. Its date of 1192-95 places it some nearly 200 years after the coronation of Stephen I, when it would seem that Christianity would by that time be well-established. Its composite form might suggest a setting down in print of diverse oral worship practices that had developed over that period. Its primary interest in Shroud forums lies in its striking graphics which are strongly suggestive of an early acquaintance of the nature of the cloth and its image well before 1204.  Whether the Funeral Sermon, the Easter Mystery Play or the various hymns may suggest more specific allusions would require a detailed study of the translation of their texts. However the original oral texts might well predate the knowledge that gave rise to the Shroud-like graphics. As you may well surmise I am only trying to attempt some intelligent guess-work here.\n\n","date":"August 25, 2013 at 7:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/22/google-mccrone-and-my-dog/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Google, McCrone and my Dog"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Amazon runs a number of ads for copies of the Pray Codex, but says it is temporarily out of stock.

In my soft cover Bantam Press edition, the example cited by Charles is on page 9 and the purpose of including the “reconstruction” is merely to illustrate a point made in a paragraph on previous page 8 explaining how the head-to-head frontal/dorsal images came to be in that form.  \nWhoever the artist cited, none of them had the advantage of Secondo Pio’s or Guiseppe Enrie’s photographic negatives demonstrating that the original cloth image is in fact a mirror image, nor did they have access to the 3-D imagery of 20th century VP-8 analysers. In that respect, Wilson’s depiction is the more accurate, showing the left hand over the right and with knees bent. If they had known a little more about crucified bodies, and given some rudimentary thought to how the image might have been formed they might have got it right. At least they placed the hands correctly on the pelvis region for their straight-legged depictions as it generally requires bent knees or long arms to place the hands on the pubis. Perhaps the point of Wilson’s citing the “della Rovere” work was to indicate that some understanding of the placement of the imagery was already appreciated by 17th century artists. They would not have had access to the Pray manuscript discovered in 1813. \nI have often noticed that those who achieve major successes in life often do so by taking short cuts lamented by more thoughtful minds, perhaps more plodding. I have known top professionals who rose to become directors of major enterprises. They relied on others to attend to mundane but absolutely essential details. Their contribution was to cut to the chase, make the point, and to let others attend to whatever was necessary.  Generals attend to strategy and subordinates attend to tactics.

D’Mulhalla with others had acquired through gifts and loans some 2.5 million dollars of advanced equipment, without which STURP would have been a No-go!

Arculf’s story is related at least second-, possibly third-hand, it may have been elaborated, the story says it is about 8ft long. If it’s the TS we have to assume it was folded in half, or that Arculf guessed wrongly at its length. How was Jesus transferred from the cross to the tomb? Maybe he was carried in the Arculf cloth, which as it would contain blood would need to be included in the burial linens, possibly as an outer wrapping. Hence a tradition that it was part of the burial linens. Guesses are free! \n2) S-W chart shows Shroud in Jerusalem 33-200. More likely it was transferred to Antioch after Herod’s persecution following execution of Stephen, and unlikely to be in Jerusalem after Roman suppressions 68-72 AD, Masada and all that. Unlikely to be included in Helena’s discoveries or she would have appropriated it along with everything else she took. Check Markwardt’s papers for various deliberately obscure references to Shroud in early Mesopotamian liturgies. JM postulates TS taken from Antioch to Edessa only with the impending destruction of Antioch by both earthquake and Persian invasions.

Is there any kind of record to support this?  \n3) S-W chart shows Shroud in Constantinople until 1247.

It was thus always so. Refer to the 1902 letter of Yves Delage to the editor of ‘Revue Scientifique’. “… a religious question has been needlessly injected into a problem which in itself is purely scientific, with the result that feelings have run high, and reason has been led astray, If, instead of Christ, there were a question of some person like a Sargon, or Achilles or one of the Pharaohs, no one would have thought of making any objection … I have been faithful to the true spirit of science … I recognize Christ as a historical personage and I see no reason why anyone should be scandalized that there still exist material traces of his earthly life.”  \nFrustrated by the hostile reception his paper had received, and the disinterest of Turin, this agnostic Professor of Anatomy turned his attention to other interests. Wilson writes that since then with the publication and circulation of Pia’s negatives, the situation has changed radically, citing the work of such medical men as Barbet, Moedder, Bucklin, Willis et al. However I believe the stiff-neckedness persists and I cannot be so optimistic. A certain Galilean prophet of the first century had a similar problem with the learned establishment of Jerusalem, apparently with the sole exception of one Nicodemus. \nUniversities and other Research Institutions rely on their funding from various commercial enterprises, hoping to turn research into profits with new products. Even government fundings hope for economic returns, and philanthropic grants are usually specific-goal directed. There are no profits or economic returns to be made from research into the Shroud and so it is ignored.  Research on the TS can only come from voluntary expert enthusiasts, sometimes with personal agendas, often retired from their professional life, or with the hope that their work might sell a book which they can write for meagre returns for their efforts. Even volunteers have to eat. Even movies of the Shroud are made with a distracting “Gee whiz!” factor in order to boost sales, but which are counter-productive to serious research. \nUntil such time as a Bill Gates or some other philanthropist can be pursuaded to fund essential research into this relic, despite it being overly-protected and confined by its ecclesial guardians, any such research can only continue on an amateur basis.

You’ll note that chapters 2 & 3 address the Book to seven significant churches in Asia Minor.  Because of the symbolism of there being seven churches, the author probably does intend the Book for the entire church.  But even in the 3rd c its canonicity was still being disputed until Athanasius in the 4th c when it was finally accepted.\nMy point in saying that the purpose of the book was to give hope to the early persecuted church, was not to limit its value to later generations, but to state that its purpose is not to set a literal calendar for the end time, as many sects and cults are prone to doing.\nYou may believe what you wish as to where Jesus may have been born, either Bethlehem or Nazareth.  Both Luke and Matthew are both set on establishing that Jesus is the Messiah as foretold in the prophecies, and to this end they both have quite different stories to assert that he was born in Bethlehem.  The only record of Herod’s slaughter of the Innocents is in Matthew and nowhere else.  But there were several reprisals aganst rebellious Jews at this time.  Matthew is concerned to establish Jesus as the new Moses, so he wants to bring him out of Egypt, but he needs a story to get him there first.  Incidentally, Luke seems to know that Mary and Joseph’s home town is Nazareth, but Matthew apparently does not, but uses Archelaus’ crucifixion of thousands of rebels to justify their settling there.\nI also happen to know quite a bit about Sir Isaac Newton.  He was a misanthrope brought about by his mother having to abandon him to her parents when she remarried.\nThere were few other scientists that Sir Isaac hadn’t had several feuds and differences with.

Meier is a highly respected Biblical scholar, and he cuts his sources to the very bone.  I suggest you Google him to satisfy yourself about his reputation.\nThe discipline that Meier set for himself in this work, is to imagine a type of conclave whereby a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew and an agnostic – all honest historians cognizant of first-century religious movements – were locked up in the bowels of Harvard Divinity School library, and not allowed to emerge until they had hammered out a consensus document on who Jesus of Nazareth was and what he intended.  “A Marginal Jew” is what Meier thinks that document would reveal.  Part of his agenda seems to be a reaction against the “Jesus Seminar” type of approach.\nSome of the answers he comes up with might be hard for some conservative Christians to take.  For example he asserts that Jesus was probably born in Nazareth rather than Bethlehem.  He rejects most speculative assertions about Jesus life.  One interesting conclusion is that he makes a decision to rely on John’s gospel to obtain a date for the crucifixion.  Here are few of his summary extracts on Jesus’ birth and crucifixion, and other key dates: \n“Jesus of Nazareth was born – most likely in Nazareth, not Bethlehem – ca. 7 or 6 BC, a few years before the death of King Herod the Great (4 BC),  After an unexceptional upbringing in a pious family of Jewish peasants in Lower Galilee, he was attracted to the movement of John the Baptist, who began his ministry in the region of the Jordan Valley around the end of 27 AD or the beginning of 28.  … ”\n“In AD 30, while Jesus was in Jerusalem for the approaching feast of Passover, he apparently sensed that the increasing hostility between the temple authorities and himself was about to reach a climax.  He celebrated a solemn farewell meal with his inner circle of disciples on Thursday evening, April 6 by our modern reckoning, and the beginning of the fourteenth of Nissan, the Day of Preparation for Passover, according to Jewish liturgical reckoning.  Arrested in Gethsemane on the night of April 6-7, he was first examined by some Jewish officials (less likely by the whole Sanhedrin) and then handed over to Pilate early in the morning of Friday, April 7.  Pilate quickly condemned him to death by crucifixion.  After being scourged and mocked, Jesus was crucified outside Jerusalem on the same day.  He was dead by the evening of Friday, April 7, 30.  He was about thirty-six years old. ”\nOn that basis, the bi-millenial of the crucifixion will occur on April 7 2030.\nMuch and all as I have considerable respect for the scientific work of Sir Isaac Newton, I would not set much store on his calculations for the end of the world.  I would also not set much store on interpretations from the book of Revelations for the end-time either.  Essentially the purpose of this Book was to sustain hope for the early persecuted church by providing an apocalyptic vision for them of the New Jersualem.  There is too much analogy and symbolism for the numbers to be taken literally.  Jesus himself said no-one knows when it will happen, only the Father. \nIf Max Patrick Hamon happens to read this, he may have his own particular comments about some of these aspects.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2012 at 6:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/02/it-seems-appropriate-to-reflect-on-this-image-of-a-scourged-blood-crowned-nailed-through-the-wrists-and-feet-lifted-up-and-pierced-crucified-man/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It seems appropriate to reflect on this image of a scourged, blood crowned, nailed through the wrists and feet, lifted up and pierced crucified man"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks for this, Kelly.

At the other end of the spectrum, I came across a highly technical study “Evolution of Primate ABO Blood Group Genes and Their Homologous Genes”, Naruya Saitou and Fumi-ichiro Yamamoto;\nhttp://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/4/399.full.pdf\nThe authors examined the blood typing in gorilla, chimpanzee, and orangutan.  I have no way of knowing how authoritative the paper is, and the paper can only be comprehended by specialists, with much being made of phylogenetic tree theory.  From their Table 5, I surmise that A is dominant in chimpanzee, B in gorilla, and AB does seem to occur in orangutan, baboon. gibbon and Java macaque.  However the paper can only be interpreted by a specialist in such studies.\nIn an earlier posting, I noted that there were significant AB occurring in such widely separated peoples as: Ainu, Kamluk, Bombay Hindu, New Guinea Papuan, and so on.

You can try the mappings with the cloth tightly wrapped around the body, or else merely draped over the body.

Clearly tightly wrapped will produce a different image from loosely draped.  \nIf the cloth is tightly wrapped and if the process is some kind of chemical contact process, then I think you might find that the mapping produces too wide an image for it to confirm that this was the process involved.  On the other hand, if the cloth is loosely draped, it might produce the near-orthogonal image that we see on the Shroud.  but then we have to decide what might be a credible process that would produce the image.  If it is a gaseous flow process, this would seem to contrain the paths of the molecules in some peculiar way.

So three degrees of miracle are to be distinguished. The first degree is represented by resurrection from the dead (quoad substantiam). The second concerns the subject (quoad subiectum): the sickness of a person is judged incurable, in its course it can even have destroyed bones or vital organs; in this case not only is complete recovery noticed, but even wholesale reconstitution of the organs (restitutio in integrum).

In order to deny the virginal birth, Yannick has to deny the doctrinal truths contained in both Matthew’s and Luke’s infancy narratives.  The great German philosopher Hegel observed that all historical movements seemed to go through a threefold process of action, reaction and integration, or as is often expressed: thesis, antithesis, synthesis.  It seems that Quebecois Catholics are going through the second stage of this process, in a similar way that the British reacted against the strait jacket of Victorianism.  A similar situation prevailed in Ireland, and now with all their covering up of abuse cases, the Irish hierarchy have lost any authority they once had.  Such reactions can never be the final answer. The truth has to be distilled in a valid synthesis over a period of time. \nThe doctrine of Mary’s PERPETUAL virginity seems to have arisen in the fourth century, and as Yannick says, it may well have served a very useful purpose in converting pagans to Christianity.  That has to have been a good result.  Nevertheless the fact remains that adoption was very common in ancient times and Mary & Joseph seem to have been the type of generous people who may well have practised adoption.  There are even examples today of childless families practising large-scale adoption.  Augustus Caesar owed his imperial role solely due to adoption, and other emperors likewise. \nEven by the evangelists using the Greek word “adelphos” in preference to “anepsios”, it still cannot be categorically asserted that Jesus’ kin were connected by blood, especially in view of these common adoptive practices, J P Meier notwithstanding.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2012 at 6:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/25/must-read-cloning-the-man-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ:  Cloning the man on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Isaiah 7:14 “Behold a young woman will conceive and bear a son and his name will be Immanuel…”  The Book of Isaiah was written over a period of two centuries.  This extract is from the first book, written about 740 – 700 BC.  The reference to the son is sometimes incorrectly interpreted as referring to Cyrus II who liberated the exiles from Babylon, but this is too late.  Isaiah addressed these words to the young Ahaz King of Judah about 733 BC, promising that Jaweh would send him this sign, in his war against Israel & Syria.  When the Septuagint was written in Greek about 200 BC, the translators used a word for young woman which came to be interpreted as “virgin”.  The evangelists e.g. Matthew, picked this up and applied it to the virginal birth of Jesus.  Other remarkable births occur in the OT, e.g. the Genesis story of the birth of Isaac to Sarah when she was well past normal child-bearing days.  There are others.  It seems to be an ancient writers’ convention of signalling that the person being born can be expected to be someone quite remarkable, and is a sign that the person is a sign of God’s (or the gods’) intervention perhaps in a time of some turmoil.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2012 at 8:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/25/must-read-cloning-the-man-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ:  Cloning the man on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Senior110 asks some profound questions, but they are somewhat off topic for this website; I’ll endeavour to give my own brief answers, but I don’t expect that others will necessary agree.  I feel he needs to do some reading by good modern Catholic authors which may help to enlighten him.  I suggest he might start by.reading such a simple book as “Jesus of Nazareth” by Pope Benedict XVI – Josef Ratzinger, Doubleday English translation 2007.  The book is simple, authoritative and takes account of modern scholarship and I feel strikes a reasonable balance between conservatism and liberalism.  He can then advance from that to other works of scholarship.  But he should be warned against takng too seriously the liberalism of those who seek to reduce Christianity by a type of rationalism, such as certain writers in the so-called “Jesus seminar” brigade. \nS110 mentions allegories and metaphors and wonders where truth is to be found.  I’ll confine my comments to the gospels by way of illustration.  Briefly, the evangelists were less concerned to write history than they were to proclaim Jesus as Christ.  Do not expect them to write history in the manner of the Jewish historian Josephus for example.  They do draw on history, but they were speaking to a people who had their own perspective of the world, and their message had to be understood inside that perspective if it was to be effective.  \nHis questions:\n(1)  The early and medieval Church considered that the souls of the just who predated Christ, were in a state called Limbo – they awaited the saving power of Christ’s redemption.  It may have been taken from Matthew’s Passion narrative which recounts how the dead came out of their tombs upon Christ’s death on the Cross.  Or was it just the perception from the earthquake?\nMy own Bible Study group recently discussed this question in our study of I Peter, who has Christ descending to Sheol to preach to the dead.  Or there may be another interpretation of the text.  My own view is that we are constrained by our perception of a three dimensional world which is time dependent.  But with the divine there is no time – Everything is Now!  There is no before nor after.  We only ask the question because of our perception of time.  But in reality, I suspect that the question may have no real meaning in terms of the spiritual or divine, neither of which are material substances.\n(2) The general consensus of most scholars is that Matthew was compiled sometime after the Fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD.  Some will disagree with that view.  About 90% of Mark which most maintain was written earlier, can be found in Matthew,  [A dissenting view gives Matthew priority, but I’ll stay with the majority.  Encyclopedia Britannica claims that Matthew was written after 70 AD for example.]  I maintain that Matthew’s “this generation will not pass away before these things occur”  refers to Christ foretelling the Fall of Jerusalem.  Matthew is concerned here in demonstrating the foreknowledge of Jesus as part of Matthew’s understanding of who Jesus really was.  But the story is also mixed in with a story about the Last Judgement, but no-one knows when this will happen.  Certainly there was an expectation in the early Church that Christ would return sometime soon.  Some of Paul’s epistles, many of which were written before 70AD, warn against this early expectation and seem to seek to dispel it, as with God, “a thousand years is but a day”.      \n(3) I do not agree with a certain popular view, seen in some postings here for instance, that the God of the Old Testament was a God of hate or vengeance.  What I feel we have lost is a sense of God being all-powerful, a God of judgement, concerned for justice, and a God of righteousness, because it is fashionable to be uncomfortable with these ideas of God – we are rightfully frightened of a power that is greater than our own mere humanity.  He is a jealous God who will not tolerate the lies of false gods.  He is also a God of consequences.  The punishments that are inflicted on the wicked are seen as a natural consequence of sin, of what happens when one falls away from God.\nThe prophets, and in particular the minor prophets, were concerned with justice for the poor, the weak, the orphans, the widows, and they railed against those who exploited them with a pretence of being holy and following the Law.  God is even patient with Pharaoh in the Exodus story – He gives Pharaoh twelve opportunities of releasing His people from slavery.  There is much more that could be written on this topic.  The Book of Job for example seeks to find an explanation for why bad things happen to good people.  \nI hope that these few notes might go some little way in helping to resolve some of the issues mentioned.\n\n","date":"November 28, 2012 at 6:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/25/must-read-cloning-the-man-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ:  Cloning the man on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Dear Senior110:  I’m sorry to have to dispel your illusions, but your Neale Walsch is just another fake, a false prophet.

The 4th century doctrine of.Mary’s perpetual viginity is still viable   if said brothers and sisters were adoptees.  It could provide another explanation of why family members in any such tomb, regardless of whether its in Talpiot or elsewhere, would not share the same DNA.

He discusses the blood-flows from the wrists in considerable detail, the scenarios he proposes for the act of crucifixion are I think credible, have several advantages in military efficiency, and include detailed anatomical and triangulation analysis.  I feel that Zugibe’s experimental attempts appear to me to be a little too contrived and represent an inadequate depiction.  \nBarbet of course envisages that the prisoner is nailed to the cross-beam with his arms stretched out along and parallel to it.  On lifting the cross-beam onto the upright, the body then sags, and the arms take up a position at 65 degrees to the vertical.  He postulates a type of seesaw motion as the  prisoner seeks to continue breathing by raising and lowering himself on the nail through the feet. Of the blood-flows emanating from the wrists he writes: \n“… The body thus alternates … between a sagging position and a state of asphyxia and a raised position which brings relief.   In each position the vertical flow of blood, which coagulates slowly on the skin, would make a slightly different angle with the axis of the forearm.  The flow furthest from the hand, which is at an angle of 65^o, corresponds to the sagging position.  The one nearest the hand corresponds with the raised position and gives an angle from of from 68^o to 70^o.”   \nHe supports this scenario with further geometrical and anatomical analysis, the amount of stretch available at the joints, and some Pythagoras, etc.  Altogether a more thorough analysis than the toy experiments of Garlaschelli and Borrini.\n\n","date":"April 14, 2015 at 9:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/11/new-garlaschelli-and-borrini-study/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"New Garlaschelli and Borrini Study"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"As a sometime amateur editor, I’ve discovered that proof-reading is an acquired skill, which requires remarkable focus, even so typos still creep through, particularly if you’re prone to complex-new-word-synthesism!

The standard serological tests are sufficient to distinguish human and non-human primate blood from that of other animals.  Regarding non-human primate blood other means are required using other blood components.  The posting includes the following: \n“To date, the only study that directly addresses the human nature of the Shroud bloodstains is an often overlooked report by Baima Ballone et al. that evaluated the expression of additional blood components found on red blood cells, specifically the M,N, and S antigens. (Such antigens have also been studied in the blood analysis of King Tut). The conclusion was that the bloodstains on the Shroud are characterized as MNS positive. What is most significant about these studies is that unlike M and N antigens, which are shared between certain primates and humans, the S antigen is exclusive to humans only. No S counterpart exists in other species, including apes or monkeys. This point was not emphasized (or mentioned) in the report, as the significance of this relationship among primates was not fully elucidated until several years later (in non-Shroud related studies). Of the six serological analyses of blood components on the Shroud, this brief study remains the single most definitive piece of serological evidence that directly addresses the human origin of the blood on the Shroud. For a more detailed discussion see: “Empirical evidence that the blood on the Shroud of Turin is of human origin: Is the current data sufficient?” recently published on shroud.com. The full-length manuscript is available at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/kearse1.pdf.”\nAlso mentioned is that the tests were carried out some thirty years ago, and better tests are now available. \nRegarding Hugh’s comment: “obduracy on my part(?)” I can only say “Probably!” Kelly comments: “Moreover, Adler has effectively commented on the difficulties a forger would encounter in trying to apply clotting blood [of any species] to various regions on the Shroud.”\n\n","date":"February 19, 2013 at 5:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/19/on-the-topic-of-bloodstains-picking-up-threads-of-useful-discussion/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"On the Topic of Bloodstains: Picking up Threads of Useful Discussion"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Wiki has a very comprehensive article on the claim of the Roza Bal shrine containing the tomb of Jesus, including references to reviews by various heavy-weights.

Of the three victims recovered at the request of Josephus, only one of them survived even after medical attention, and none of them had been given the fatal percussio blow.  \nIn Rome as part of the Capitoline collection, can be found the famous so-called Dying Gaul statue, a marble copy of a now-lost bronze original probably dating to about 220-230 BC.  The model has been identified as a Galatian, and the statue shows a sword wound at the lower right chest, quite identical to the chest wound of the Man of the Shroud.  It is a classic blow, known as the percussio, and was taught in the Roman military academies.  The consequences are always fatal, as the blow pierces both the heart and the pleural cavity.  \nUnder Roman Law, victims of crucifixion could be released to the family upon request, and this would only be denied for the most serious crimes of sedition or piracy.  In such cirumstances, the body could only be released after the percussio blow had been delivered to ensure that death had occurred.  In the gospel of John we read that the soldiers pierced the side of Jesus so that the body could be released to Joseph of Arimathaea, and that blood and water came out, the ‘water’ being the pericardial fluid.  The stain from this flow is apparent on the Shroud.  Upon death, the right ventricle is full of blood, and this is the source of the blood at the chest wound of the Shroud.  Quite likely it is also the source of the blood across the back flowing there as a result of the transport operation.\nIt may suit some religious perspectives to claim that Jesus survived his crucifixion to be eventually buried in Kashmir.  However this claim is utterly lacking in any adequate factual supporting evidence, in view of the manifest percussio blow delivered.  Citing one such survivor as reported by Josephus is inadequate, as the circumstances were clearly quite different.  One does not wrap a person in a Shroud, and roll a large boulder across the tomb entrance, as reported in all four gospels, if there is any prospect at all that the person might still be alive.

His chapter 2 on archaeology aspects, for example, refers to his indebtedness to a Jesuit scholar Fr Holzmeister who had published a study on the subject of crucifixion in Verbum Dei (review of the Pontifical Biblical Institute) in 1934.  Likely  he also had access to other concurrent sources as well, and he himself was no mean classics scholar.  His extremely detailed commentary on the chest wound pp 129-139 etc, suggest to me that it would take some skill and accuracy to direct the spear to pierce the right auricle, the mortal target, and if it were misjudged, the thrust might be unsuccessful.  However it is clearly a skill that could be taught with proper training, and his assertion that it would be so taught does not seem unreasonable.  I do think it curious that the very same wound also appears on the Dying Gaul statue, and seems consistent with Barbet’s description, notwithstanding Charles’ dismissal of the idea.

This seems to have happened with the Ahmadiyya sect, asserting that Jesus was buried in Kashmir.  Possibly a reaction against the excesses of the earlier British Raj might have been a factor in creating these mythologies.  However, unlike very many religious movements, Christianity is founded less on a set of myths and legends, and is in fact rooted in real historic events, the life, death and resurrection of Yoshua bar Joseph of Nazareth in 1st century Palestine, of which there is ample historic evidence.  There is no historic evidence that he was ever in Kashmir, but only myths, legends and subjective interpretations created by local peoples as their way of importing into their culture what they saw as the teaching of a particularly gifted prophet.\n\n","date":"August 31, 2015 at 6:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

As I understand, it is an Islamic belief that Jesus survived his crucifixion.  The arguments against this include the gospel accounts “that he gave up the ghost” i.e. that he died, specifically the percussio blow would ensure death as discussed at length by Barbet, the evidence of the chest wound and the blood & serum stains from the chest wound evident on the Shroud cloth, the recorded astonishment of the witnesses afterwards at his resurrection, and the opinion of very many pathologists who have examined the Shroud cloth. \nDavid Goulet has pointed to a likely explanation for the belief, and it seems corroborated by a reading of the Ronald email.  There we read more of motivation rather than any logical argument.  The adaptation of religious beliefs to suit the local culture has always been practised from time immemorial.  Thus late Judaism was clearly influenced by the cultures they came in contact with, whether it was from Babylon during the exile, Zoroastrianism from Persian influences, observation of Egyptian funerary practices in Alexandria, or the adaptation of Greek Platonism.  \nIt was evident in the founding of Mormonism, and it can be seen in later Pacific cultures, specifically in NZ, with the founding of the Ringatu and Ratana indigenous religions. \nThe interaction of early missionaries with local cultures has often not been a happy one.  They have too often neglected the advice of that arch-missionary to the east, St Francis Xavier.  The following extract on St Francis Xavier, seems apt: \n“Twentieth-century scholarship has dispelled many of the legends connected with Xavier and has also defended him against his critics. A modern estimate puts the figure of those baptized by him at about 30,000, as opposed to the 1,000,000 asserted by Baroque exaggeration. In reality he had to struggle with language wherever he worked and did not possess the gift of tongues attributed to him. He is justly credited for his idea that the missionary must adapt to the customs and language of the people he evangelizes, and for his advocation of an educated native clergy—initiatives not always followed by his successors.”\n“Research has shown that he always provided for the continuing pastoral care of the communities he founded and did not abandon them after Baptism as some critics maintained. In fact, many of his own efforts were spent instructing those baptized hastily by others. The areas he evangelized in India have remained Catholic to the present day. Vigorous and prolonged persecution in the 17th century did destroy the missions he founded in the Moluccas and Japan but only after thousands had died as martyrs. Even before his death Francis Xavier was considered a saint, and he has been formally venerated as such by the Catholic Church since 1622. In 1927 he was named patron of all missions.”  Rev Robert L Birely SJ.\n\n","date":"August 31, 2015 at 3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

In 519 BC, Darius I, king of Persia crucified 3,000 political opponents in Babylon;  In 71 BC, following the uprising of Spartacus, the Roman consul Marcus Licinius Crassus crucified 6,000 slaves on crosses set up on the Appian Way between Capua and Rome;  In 88 BC, Alexander Janneaus the Judean king and high priest crucified 800 Pharisaic opponents.  Following the death of Herod the Great in 4 BC, riots broke out in Jerusalem while his heir Archelaus was in Rome obtaining imperial ratification of Herod’s will.  The Syrian governor suppressed the uprising, crucifying some 3,000 Jews.  Further crucifixions followed the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, and Nero practised mass crucifixions during his anti-Christian persecutions.  Notwithstanding this prevalence, few bodies have been specifically idesntified as crucifixion victims.  One reason is that crucifixion nails were highly prized as medical talismans by the Roman soldiery.  Another reason is that bones were seldom penetrated by the nails – the Romans were “awfully” good at it.  The identity of the crucfixion victim visible on the Shroud is a fair question. \nFor those who have not already read it, my own attempt at an answer can be found on Andy Weis’ Shroud museum site: http://shroudnm.com/docs/2012-07-09-David-Belz-Shroud-Article.pdf\nTo that I might add my additional comments at #9 above. \nDespite Constantine’s abolishing crucifixion in 337, barbarism continues alive and well in the southern states of Saudi Arabia.  This morning’s news reported that seven young men have been sentenced to three days of crucifixion after which they will be finished off by firing squad.  Their crime revealed by confessions extorted after torture was that as juveniles they were alleged to be part of a ring of jewellery store thieves.  All of them deny killing anyone.

The essential features are that it is a denary system, with 10 separate symbols including a zero place-holder. The only other system that came anywhere near to it in sophistication, was the Babylonian base-60 system of about 1000 BCE. It found its way into the West, through the Moors in Spain and North Africa, initially by Pope Sylvester around 1000AD, and subsequently by Leonardo Fibonacci around 1200AD.  It had earlier spread through South-East Asia, but with symbols particular to local ethnic scripts, and their writing implements. Very likely it entered China through Indian Buddhism, but this is debated.    \nSyrian bishop Severus Sebokht refers to the superiority of the system in the 7th century, in chastising the mathematical arrogance of the Greeks.  The earliest alleged known examples are Sanskrit copper plate deeds from the 6th to 10th centuries concerning properties granted to Brahman religious authorities. Other examples are stone inscriptions, including a date corresponding to 875AD, and numbered verses of a poem. \nThe ‘3’ symbol on the forehead of the TSM, is the result of a blood-flow across a furrowed brow.  Those with a penchant for number mysticism will want to make something of it, but essentially it is merely pareidolia, an accidental pattern. If a Trinity symbol is to be sought, then the Nicene Creed has the Holy Spirit as No.3, not God incarnate. \nThe book of Jonah is neither an historical nor prophetic book, there are no oracles as in all other prophetic books.  Essentially it is a post-exilic satire about a reluctant prophet, the only character in the work, a Jew, who comes out of it badly. It was directed against the exclusiveness of a post-exilic Judaism, with its policy of a pure blood race of Jews that the reformers Ezra and Nehemiah had implemented in the 5th century. \nAnd it’s a fish, not a whale.  This should say something to us about the non-literal nature of the work.  It is interesting that all other characters in the story (non-Jewish) are made to look good, all except poor old Jonah! Jonah eventually comes to the realization that God was a universal God, and not the sole property of Israel, the essential intent of the story. \nI’m no great fan of Marcus Borg, but his solution of the “three days” in the tomb is on the money as far as I’m concerned. \nJesus might well have appreciated the essentially fictional nature of the Jonah story, after all most of what he had to say was expressed in parables. I see no problem in his using it to express its close analogy with his being in the tomb.\n\n","date":"December 4, 2013 at 6:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/04/the-big-3-issue-or-jesus-simply-misspoke/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"The Big 3 Issue or  “Jesus simply misspoke”"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh’s list of attributes omits one telling piece of circumstantial evidence.

Remember he is envisaging that the arms are stretched along the cross-bar, and the wrists nailed to the cross-bar with the arms fully extended.  As the cross-bar is lifted up onto the upright, the body sags with the full weight taken by the arms only.  As the body becomes vertical, simple statics will show that the tension in each arm becomes 207 lb at 65^o.  It is only when the feet are nailed to the upright, that this tension can be relieved.  \nI get the impression from Barbet, that he believes he can confirm the 65^o as much from the limits of joint movement between shoulder and upper arm and the consequential triangulation, as much as from the blood flows.  \nThe lifting of the crossbar onto the upright does not seem admissible in Zugibe’s scenario where his volunteer is attached to a fixed cross already in position.  This allows Zugibe to claim that the arm tensions are much less than 207 lb, and that therefore wrist nailing is not required.  Even so, with any significant arm tension at all, with arms outstretched, I should think it very difficult indeed for any traumatised victim to sustain a bent elbow at all.  Triangulation from a rigid cross-bar would seem to argue against it.  \nWe are of course only seeing the blood-flows on the outer surface of the arm.  One question might need to be resolved by some experimentation, that is, to what extent would the surface contours of the arm under tension provide a track for blood flows along the arm at the angle of 65^o, or would they indeed be vertical.  Would the head of the nail jam the wrists hard against the cross-bar so that the flow is constricted, or is it sufficient if the wrists are merely pinned to the crossbar, allowing a gap, that would not constrict the flow.  The viscosity of the blood at the time of flow, might also be a significant variable. \nYet another aspect might be, at what time during the execution did these now visible flows occur?  Did they occur while hanging from the cross, or did they occur after the victim had died during his removal from the cross?  If the latter, than all bets would be off, as the flows would then depend on the incidental disposition of the arms at the particular time the flows occurred.  But that might depend if wrist wounds can bleed after death.  My own sightings of blood-flows in an abattoir suggest to me that they might well do so, but I would be happy to be corrected by professional opinion.\n\n","date":"April 15, 2015 at 7:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/11/new-garlaschelli-and-borrini-study/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"New Garlaschelli and Borrini Study"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Marcus Borg was a fellow of the Jesus Seminar, a fellow traveller of John Dominic Crossan, neither of whose views are consonant with the resurrection, nor of orthodoxy.

However she made a point that there were no such stories emanating from Egypt.  Why?  Because the Nile floods were predictable, always occurred during a fixed season, and were seen as essential to the fertility of the Nile Valley!  \nIn the closing chapters of The Epic of Gilgamesh, we are told of Utnapishtim, who alone of all humanity, except for his family escaped such a devastating flood, and resided at the mouth of the Euphrates.  Gilgamesh, overcome with grief by the death of his companion Enkidu, sets out on a journey to find Utnapishtim and to discover the secret of immortality.  However a serpent stole the plant from Gilgamesh he had obtained which would give immortality, and so his quest was unsuccessful. \nGilgamesh is the first human hero that was ever set down in writing and its earliest known tablets date from before 2000 BC.  There are very close parallels with the incidental details of the story of Noah.  These would indicate that this story was set down in Genesis during the Babylonian Captivity sometime in the 6th century BC.  However there are major differences.  In the Utnapishtim story, the floods are sent by a goddess as an act of spite against humanity.  The Jewish writers give the story of the flood an entirely different religious meaning, more profound, and Noah is saved as an act of a merciful God.   \nDoubtless there were devastating floods at the end of the Ice Age, but it would seem unlikely that there would be any group memory of such events.  The purpose of the Noah story, is intended to be religious, and its setting can be related to devastating floods that occurred in ancient Uruk.\n\n","date":"October 14, 2015 at 12:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/11/was-jesus-body-washed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Was Jesus’ Body Washed?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Most DIY Kiwis (we are famous for using No. 8 wire  technology here) would understand the distinction between pliers and pincers well.

Images were of a snake and a metallic key, and the key of course wouldn’t be generating amines.  Rogers dismissed the likelihood of radiation causing the TS image, as he couldn’t see it giving the necessary superficiality.  I think it may well be that radiation has some kind of role, perhaps in collimating the imaging process, or in producing the orthogonality.

The cylinder and cone are not curved in three dimensions and can be so developed; Spheres and ellipsoids cannot.  Commonest example is the globe of the earth.  It is impossible to create a two-dimensional map of the earth and to preserve the scale of all distances between any two places. \nIt is theoretically possible to enclose a sphere with a rubber sheet, to stretch it non-uniformly so that all points of the sphere are in contact with the sheet.  The distortion stretch of the rubber sheet cannot be uniform but must be variable (simple example – a child’s toy balloon cherry).  Most fabrics have neither the elasticity nor extensibility to maintain such contact.  If one of the curvatures is fairly flat then some practical fabrics may be sufficiently extensible to maintain contact. \nParts of the human body are curved in three dimensions: skull, shoulders, extremities, insteps, buttocks, small of the back.  Other parts are curved in two dimensions with only minimal curvature in the third dimension: limbs and trunk and semi-planar aspects. \nIt is therefore impossible, a mathematically physical certainty, to wrap a body in a linen shroud so that all parts of the body surface are in contact with it, and some tenting is inevitable where the body is sufficiently curved in three dimensions.  This compromises any assertion that the Shroud image can only arise from direct contact with the cloth.  Jackson and Jumper have of course shown that some of the imaging process can cross a small air gap, perhaps up to 4 cm, with some attenuation of the image.\n\n","date":"July 14, 2014 at 11:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/13/why-doesnt-the-blood-create-an-image/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Why Doesn’t the Blood Create an Image?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"More extravagant nonsense from the serpent yet again raising its head in the Garden of Paradise.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2013 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/08/you-guys-are-brutal/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"You guys are brutal"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My congratulations to Yannick for an excellent paper.  One particular aspect I liked about this particular paper of Yannick’s, is that It is self-disciplined withour excursions into speculation on theories which I know are close to his heart, but wisely he has refrained from including them and just given facts, and the consequential reasoning to logical conclusions,  \nI would make two observations of a semi-technical nature: \n1)  Identity of the victim:  There were thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of victims executed by the barbaric punishment of crucifixon.  So identifying the actual victim, “Whose image is on the Shroud?” is a fair and reasonable question.  However, capping or crowning with thorns was never a normal part of Roman crucifixion.  In the case of Jesus, it was a spontaneous act carried out on the whim of a Roman soldier, perhaps on sighting some thorn branches gathered for firewood, and to mock the claim that he was KING of the Jews.  “They dressed him up in purple, twisted some thorns into a crown and put it on him; and they began saluting him ‘Hail, King of the Jews!’ They struck his head with a reed and spat on him; and they went down on their knees to do him homage.” (Mark 15: 16-19).  The crowning (capping) of thorns then is clearly seen as being solely part of the mockery as King of the Jews. and UNIQUELY identifies the Shroud man as Jesus Christ.  It is just too long a shot to assert that someone else was similarly capped and that it may have been some other victim.  Even the Jesuit sceptic Herbert Thurston was obliged to admit in 1903: “If this is not the impression of the Christ, it was designed as the counterfeit of that impression.  In no other person since the world began could these details be verified.”  \n2) Option 4: “In any way, a “dematerialization” of his body at the moment of the resurrection (accompanied or not by a burst of energy) could explain why the body left the Shroud before it started to corrupt,”\nThere is a physics problem with the literal notion of “dematerialisation”.  As recently stated on a previous blog, dematerialisation would result in too great a burst of energy as matter would then be converted into radiation, someone estimating that it would be equal to a 10 GT nuclear explosion, which clearly didn’t happen.  I prefer an explanation that envisages resurrection of the body as some kind of supernatural transformation – St Paul and theologians explain it as a “glorified body”.  One explanation I offered was that the body entered some kind of parallel universe.  In other words somewhere in all of creation, there is still a resurrected body of the Christ.\n\n","date":"July 28, 2012 at 7:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/28/yannick-delights-with-another-great-paper/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Yannick Delights with Another Great Paper"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It was Henry Ford who asserted that “History is bunk!”  From the various depictions of Christian art we have seen here recently, I’m coming to the conclusion that much of Art is bunk, when we attempt to interpret it as a realistic impression!  We have seen on another thread the recent restoration of what is clearly a beautiful depiction of a Savoy display of the Shroud with Cardinal Borromeo, together with a Savoy saint who happened to have died some hundred years or so previously, and many questions were raised about the artist’s depicted impressions of the Shroud which could not be answered satisfactorily.  \nIn two art works posted on this thread above, we see artists’ depictions of the flagellation, both comparatively modern works.  In both cases we see Christ’s arms bound at waist level.  There are apparently no scourge wounds on the image of the TSM’s arms, and the conclusion would have to be that the arms were actually bound above the head.  This was apparently the usual practice of Roman flagellation, is noted by Barbet, and there are clearly good executioner reasons why this should be so, particularly if the prisoner should happen to faint during the flagellation. \nSome clues may be taken from art works, there are small tokens of realism which the artist may be aware of and has attempted to depict, but clearly also much that they are ignorant of.  The watchword is caution when it comes to attempting to read too much into what is shown in such works.  Realism is often a secondary objective in art, the primary objective being more frequently to inspire empathetic or a devotional state of mind in the observer.  It very much depends on the skill, knowledge and intentions of the artist.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2015 at 2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/29/were-some-bloodstains-added-later-or-maybe-retouched/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Were Some Bloodstains Added Later or Maybe Retouched?"}],"coins":[{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Correspondents who may not be aware of it, can find and download an interesting and authoritative paper on the repairs carried out by the Poor Clares in 1534:\n“Report of the Clare Nuns of Chambery who mended the Shroud in 1534” from the book ‘Le Sainte Suaire de Chambery a Sainte-Claire-en-Ville (Avril-Mai 1534) par M. l’Abbe Leon Bouchage 1891:\nhttp://www.shroud.it/CLARES.PDF   [PDF is secured and so cannot be directly copied and pasted, version is in English]\n\n","date":"March 10, 2014 at 3:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/10/of-google-doodles-and-other-coincidences/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Of Google Doodles and Other Coincidences"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, Thanks for the correction.

The last few years I have has as my desktop wallpaper the standard MS picture of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain.  I’ve frequently noticed that under certain conditons of room lighting, or the angle of the sun coming through the window, that unmistakeable faces, sometimes even of recognizable personages, appear on the faces of the standing stones.  I’m also reasonably certain that neither the Stone Age people who carved them, nor a retouching of the picture have intentionally produced this impression.  Other readers might like to check it out.  It is one small piece of evidence why I remain prudently cautious about claims for seeing various images that may or may not be real objects, notwithstanding Max’s insistence, but I fully understand where he is coming from.  \nThere was an earlier discussion some time back concerning Robert De Clari’s claims concerning seeing the various stages of Jesus’s life on the Shroud cloth.  Clearly De Clari would be reporting what he believed he saw.  At the time, Max produced some coarse images which certainly seemed to support De Clari’s perception.  I recall that he mentioned he would endeavour to enhance them with clearer images.  If Max has developed those images further, I for one would like a reference to where they might be viewed   \nAnother example in the importance of lighting angle, are the wrinkles and folds on the Shroud cloth which become clearly visible only under conditions of raking light, as demonstrated in a John Jackson video posted here some months ago.  Clearly the wrinkles and folds are certainly always there, but only become visible under the proper lighting conditions.  There are any number of other examples in the type of light, such as whether it’s visible light, UV, or IR.

The calculated ratio of ‘S’ = 0.4 is dismissed on basis of the subjective pictorial comparison of the violin and the accordion.  I suggest that there is an objective Test of Significance that ought to have been carried out by the Stats investigator in this case.  In the Standard Correlation test for two variables (x, y), the coefficient of correlation ‘r’ would be transformed into a ‘z’ variable where z = atanh (r) (inverse hyperbolic tangent of ‘r’).  The sample value of ‘z’ will then be normally distributed with standard deviation 1 / sqrt(n – 3) where n is the number of data points.  This then enables confidence levels to be determined for the true value of ‘z’ and hence ‘r’.  If the data are completely uncorrelated, the hypothesis that ‘r’ = 0, can then be tested.

False conclusions may be made by the inexperienced or inadequately informed amateur who fails to understand what a statistical test is about, and who fails to probe further in not measuring its significance.  I frequently applied it, along with regression analysis during my working life in researching sets of engineering and financial data,.  It is more commonly applied when a linear relationship may be assumed between two variables, but it can be extended to multivariate analysis, and also by means of appropriate transformations to include non-linear situations,  A text-book I still have by Paul G Hoel Professor of Mathematics in California and published as long ago as 1962 validates these applications.      \nKarl Pearson 1857-1936 was one of the key founders of modern statistical theory.  His correlation test was only one of many contributions he made to the science.  \n“Neither regression nor correlation analyses can be interpreted as establishing cause-and-effect relationships. They can indicate only how or to what extent variables are associated with each other. The correlation coefficient measures only the degree of linear association between two variables. Any conclusions about a cause-and-effect relationship must be based on the judgment of the analyst.”  (Encyc Brit)  Despite this EB quote, non-linear and multivariate correlation can still be tested by transforming the data.  A paragraph in my comment at #17, indicates the appropriate method of testing levels of significance.  \nAlthough the paper provides some fascinating observations on optical illusions, referring to Gestalt theory as an explanation, and includes citations and references, it is somewhat devoid of the experimental data.

Following graduation I followed it up with several supplementary papers in the topic during the following 20 or so years.  My first formal text was by Paul G Hoel, Professor of Mathematics, University of California in L.A. published in 1962,  It was an excellent work, and despite other subsequent texts I often had cause to refer back to it, and occasionally still do.  Towards the end of my career for some ten years during the 1990s I was advising the Internal Audit of a major NZ Corporate on the design of their sampling systems for audit purposes.  \nI believe a scientist seeks to obtain an absolute rigorous truth, which in theory is actually unattainable.  He has to be satisfied with building a theory which is as close to the truth as the evidence will take him at that particular time.  But he knows that ultimately it will be surpassed as new knowledge comes to hand.  The history of scientific progress adequately demonstrates that.  \nIn engineering, the engineer is expected to deliver within an acceptable time frame, he has little time available to him for research, and he has to be content with an acceptable economic solution that his knowledge can take him at that particular time.  In our Law courts the attempt to arrive at the truth is one notch lower than that of the scientist, and persons are condemned or liberated on the balance of reasonable probabilities, and a weight of circumstantial evidence may be sufficient.  In Audit, the quest is one notch lower again, and the auditor is content to give his assurance on such evidence as he may judge is sufficient according to the various tests he can economically apply. \nHoel discusses the question of the validity of sampling tests at length as early as Chapter 3 ‘Nature of Statistical Methods’.  “A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about the frequency function of a random variable.”  “A test of a statistical hypothesis is a procedure for deciding whether to accept or reject the hypothesis.”  \nHe then distinguishes between two types of error.  The Type I Error occurs when the hypothesis is actually true, but the sample falls into the critical area when the hypothesis is therefore falsely rejected.  The Type II Error occurs when the hypothesis is actually false but the sample falls within the true area, and so the hypothesis is falsely accepted.  Sampling therefore does not yield an absolute truth, but only a relative truth, it is no more than one particular method for making a decision.  It is an underlying assumption of course that the samples will also pass standard tests for being adequately representative, and there must be a sufficient number of samples which adequately demonstrate the amount of dispersion.  \nIn the case of the 1988 C-14 samples on the Shroud, there was in fact only one small sample taken, and there have been several valid questions raised that it was not in fact truly representative of the whole.  This single sample was split three ways, and the individual laboratories split their shares of the sample again so they could each run three individual tests on their share.  The control pieces have been criticised as inadequate, and of a different type from the sample and not comparable to the parent cloth.  Their results have been reported as apparently failing even a standard chi square test.  Even so, it might be asserted that the tests could be a valid result as far as the original sample was concerned.  However it cannot be asserted that the tests have been sufficiently rigorous to make any definitive statement about the age of the original cloth.  It is certainly not an absolute truth, it hardly passes as any kind of relative truth, I would not pass it even as an adequate audit test, and scientists ought not to hang on to it as passing any kind of worthwhile authentic scientific test!\n\n","date":"October 4, 2014 at 4:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/04/an-abstract-for-today/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Abstract for Today"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The idea that the the 1988 C-14 project would serve only as a “ranging shot” won’t wash.

Was it just the empty tomb?  Was it just the burial cloths set aside?  Or did he see the image?  We do not know! \nJohn 20:11-12:  “11 But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping.  And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb 12 and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.”\nDid Mary see two angels, “one at the head and one at the foot where the body of Jesus had been” Or did she interpret the sight of the image as angels?

I might speculate for example that this universe in which we exist is actually a subset of a higher universe.  A goldfish might imagine that his bowl is the entire universe, but we might place him in some other aquarium.  For him, he has moved to a different universe.  An ant on a table may imagine that the universe has only two dimensions, but we say there are actually four which are commonly known, although some would have it there are actually ten or twelve but the others are curled up.  \nAt the Resurrection, the body of Jesus was transformed in a way that we do not understand, except the bounds of our known universe were no longer any constraint for him.

He claimed that nail passed through Destot’s space and severed median nerve resulting in reflex retraction of thumb into palm. His calculation of 207lb arm tension would result in tearing of the palm, but could be supported by wrist nailing. His experiments with amputated limbs seemed to support his assertion. Consequently there has been a tendency to accept his conclusion. \n2) The only mention in the scriptures of Jesus being nailed to the cross, rather than bound by ropes, is in John 20:25. Barbet asserts that nailing was the usual Roman practice in Palestine. Author of John’s gospel uses the Greek word ‘cheira’. Apparently this word can mean hand, wrist, or forearm. Jerome’s Latin Vulgate translates it as ‘manus’, hand. The Latin for wrist is ‘carpus’. As the Latin Vulgate was the primary authority, generations of artists showed the nails as passing through the palms of the hands.\nThe Greek word ‘cheira’ also occurs in Luke’s Acts of the Apostles at Acts 12:7, describing Peter’s release from prison. Again, Jerome tranlates it as “manus” rather than “carpus”. Consequently, most of the English translations have “and the chains fell from his hands”. A moment’s thought will realise that “the chains actually fell from his wrists”. More recent translations including USCCB translation use the word “wrists” for Acts’ ‘cheira’. \n3) Frederick Zugibe was highly critical of Barbet’s conclusions. He maintains that Barbet was confused about the location of both Destot’s space and median nerve, notwithstanding Barbet’s thumb retraction experiments. FZ considered that the thumb being hidden on the TS was merely because the natural relaxed position of the thumb in death or asleep is in the palm. He suggests an alternative path for the nail from the base of the palm with exit on the wrist as shown on TS. He illustrates an instance of this with a needle showing the path of a blade through the hand of an actual stabbing victim. The paper also includes several other interesting illustrations, including his crucifixion experiments. His crucifxion experiments involving foot support, ressulted in arm tensions of only about 65lb compared to 207lb when freely suspended by arms alone. This tension could be sustained by the path he proposes. \n“PIERRE BARBET REVISITED” BY Frederick T.

I imagine that if the victim fainted during the scourging, then he was still held vertical so this wouldn’t be a problem during the business.  This may mean that the Psalter artist’s depiction with the hands bound as in the Shroud position could be significant. I’m curious about the epsilon by the post shown in the second graphic above.

Zugibe considers that the four fingers shown on the Shroud are not due to Barbet’s assertion of thumb reflex retraction, but that this is the natural appearance of a relaxed hand from this view-point.

It is a fact that cellulose degrades over time, there’s no doubt about that.  He has results from known samples that show how under certain passive conditions of storage, what an average rate of degradation might be expected.  However the degradation rate can also be affected by other extraneous factors such as frequent handling, a kind of ‘fatigue’ action that needs to be added to the passive rate of degradation.  It should be a simple matter to discover the rate how such samples might degrade by say repeated foldings.  Fatigue tests are routinely carried out in much of materials testing, particularly in engineering metals. [Fatigue rates can also be affected by stress concentrators such as recessed corners] Fanti has the engineering labs at Padova to arrange for any of his students to set up such tests himself. \nI think it significant that what determinations he has made place the age of the Shroud much older than the C-14 tests showed, and I would suspect that any such fatigue effects cannot sufficiently account for this difference.

It is made opaque by a glazed or unglazed finish, called the Holland finish, consisting of oil and a filling material. However originally it was applied to any fine plain-woven linen imported from Europe, particularly the Netherlands. Was the Holland backing cloth sewn by the Poor Clare nuns, bleached or not? I don’t know. \nI was surprised to discover that the spinning wheel was a relatively late invention. The earliest clear illustrations come from Baghdad in 1237, and quickly found its way to India, although India is sometimes credited with the invention. The first spinning wheels were operated by hand, and although known in Europe by the 14th century did not come into immediate general use.  By this time, the Chinese were using water power to drive their spinning wheels, but this was not developed in Europe until the 18th century. A citizen of Brunswick is said to have added the treadle in 1533, and its more general European use might well date from this improvement. \nPrior to the adoption of the spinning wheel, yarn was hand-spun, by whirling a distaff holding the fibres onto a free hanging weighted spindle. However in France, the distaff and spindle were not displaced until the 18th century. Adoption of the spinning wheel meant that five spinners could keep a weaver fully occupied. \nIn the early Middle Ages, the main European textile centres producing linen fabrics seemed to have been in Flanders, notably Ghent, Ypres and Courtrai. Sicily and Palermo seemed to have specialised in silk around 1130. Textile specialists seemed to have been quite migratory, as a result of foreign invasions, or the later religious wars and persecutions. \nEnglish textiles in the 13th and 14th centuries were mainly linen and wool, the trade being influenced by Flemish fullers and dyers. In 1564 Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter for Dutch and Flemish settlers in Norwich, for production of damasks and flowered silks. Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 caused many weavers to migrate to England.  \nHow might all this bear on the question of banding, and the bleaching of linen? I think it almost certain that the Flemish fullers were bleaching completed cloth, rather than just the unwoven yarn. They would require large areas of reasonably level open fields to carry this out, where the cloth to be bleached must be spread out for several months. Flanders and the Netherlands would have met this requirement. So very likely this was the method by no later than the 13th century. \nThe earlier slower spinning methods of distaff and spindle, might have been conducive to a production process where the unwoven yarn was bleached before weaving. The spinning wheel in the 16th century would have set the closure on any remnants of this process, if it still then persisted.  \nWas bleaching of unwoven yarn terminated much earlier, say in the 4th and 5th century as some have asserted?  The only way of answering this question I think, is to look for the latest and most recent examples of banded linen cloth.  Someone must know of any such examples, which would settle this question, once and for all.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2013 at 6:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/16/bleaching-and-banding-my-guess-is-that-rogers-is-right/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Bleaching and Banding:  My guess is that Rogers is right"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"So the Daily Telegraph hacks get a story and write it up with all the usual cliches, journalese, and inaccuracies that paparazzi the world over are renown for. But it’s worthwhile checking out the PDF paper in Meccanica.  The paper itself contains a fair amount of speculation and reliance on dubious records of earthquakes around 33AD. Difficult to guess how they assessed the crucifixion/resurrection earthquakes to within one decimal place of 8.2! \nThe one interesting fact(?) to come out of the paper is that large earthquakes may apparently generate neutron emission from crushed rock, and they cite some experimental evidence for this.  It is possible that this may have been a factor in creating the image, if indeed the neutron emission actually occurred. However as for it skewing the C-14 dating of 1988, Christopher Ramsey’s comment is most relevant.  To paraphrase, “Why in this case only, and in no other?” \nIt would seem that the Torino School of Engineering is still adhering to the myth of the validity of the 1988 dating. I would suggest that they might consult with their colleagues in the Statistical Maths department there, and get a handle on how representative the sampling regime for these specimens may or, more likely, may not have been! \nI note that at the very end of the paper, Giovanna De Liso’s paper happens to be cited. Her work represents some 12 years of experimental field study in the seismically active area of Piedmont.  She mentions there the stringent conditions required for the production of Shroud-like images during earthquakes. They required aloe inhibition, concurrent variations in the geo-magnetic and electric fields, presence of iron-bearing geology, and the release of radon gas (common during earthquakes). One problem would seem to be that the decay of Radon releases not so many neutrons, as it does gamma radiation, an entirely different matter.  \nWhile one may applaud the various attempts to discover the secret of the imaging process, it seems to me that an unduly large amount of research effort is being expended at this institute in pursuit of an agenda-driven presumption, that the image was the result of some kind of radiation emanation, while other possible, even more probable causes seem not to be pursued at all.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"SJ:  “…  then God could have made sure that no human incompetence, prejudice or schemes would have prevented that happening.”\nDB:  God does not operate that way!

The only astronomy event I can recall in the gospels is the Star of Bethlehem in Matthew, which might have been any one of a number of such events, or it may only be a literary device. \nJohn’s gospel records that the Friday of the crucifixion occurred on Preparation Day, the day before Passover.  This could only have occurred in the years AD30 & AD33, and so would exclude AD29.   John P Meier in his “A Marginal Jew” opts for AD30.  He bases this on the sequence that: Jesus was born towards the closing years of Herod the Great, 7-4BC; John the Baptiser began his ministry AD27-28;  Soon after Jesus began his ministry, “then aged about 30”; Jesus’ ministry lasted no more than about two years and a few months.  Consequently Meier opts for the year AD30, as AD33 would have him closer to age 40.  \n“Pilate quickly condemned him to death by crucifixion.  After being scourged and mocked, Jesus was crucified outside Jerusalem on the same day.  He was dead by the evening of Friday, April 7, 30.  He was about thirty-six years old.” \nThe authors of the Meccanica paper refer to major Middle East earthquakes, said to have occurred in year AD33.  They might have cast their net a little further, but are silent on any seismic events in year AD30.  Possibly they are drawing on a hearsay tradition that he died at about age 33, and so derived the AD33 date.  Perhaps they should have researched the death date a little more. \nI take Hugh F’s point about the geological distinctions between sedimentary and igneous rocks, which may be relevant.  De Liso’s Piedmont site refers to the presence of gneiss, a metamorphic rock, whereas the Jerusalem site is essentially sedimentary aragonite  limestone.  I am unaware of the possible presence of iron-bearing strata at the Jerusalem site, which seems to bear most significantly on her findings.  \nDespite correspondents’  reluctance to admit radiation as the primary cause of  the TS image, the seismic events of the gospel narratives may yet prove to have been a significant factor.  It is known that Ray Rogers was not entirely happy about Maillard reaction being the exclusive cause, and felt that there had to be something else as well.  The release of radon commonly occurring during  earthquakes may have been an essential factor and been that “something else”.  \nThe crucifixion / resurrection earthquakes are mentioned in all four gospels, and cannot be easily dismissed as a literary add-on.  However the idea that radiation was the primary cause of the image has yet to win any other support among those beyond the Torino School of Engineering.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2014 at 5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/12/breaking-news-another-day-another-solution-to-the-image-and-the-carbon-dating/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Breaking News:  Another Day, Another Solution to the Image and the Carbon Dating"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, Chris: At #47 I commented on the time between Jesus’ death and his Resurrection, referring to text I Peter 3:18.

On all sides stances were taken and angry messages exchanged.  Even I found myself an intermediary in the cross-fire. When the dust began to settle, it was Turin who had won.

The three were Oxford, Zurich, and Tucson (Arizona) – all of them AMS laboratories.  The stipulated ‘experience’ criteria was the very reverse of the truth, the rejected Harwell alone having vastly more experience than all three of the chosen ones put together.”\n“Although whatever went on behind the scenes remains far from clear, Gonella had got his way, and at daybreak on 21 April 1988 representatives of the three chosen laboratories duly assembled at Turin Cathedral old sacristy … … While the scientists watched from the pews, the Shroud was solemnly brought into the room and unrolled before them.”\n“Incredibly, it was only at this point that Gonella and his close friend Giovanni Riggi proceeded at length to deliberate on the best location from which to take the sample that was to be apportioned between the three laboratories.

As such they cannot be New Testament history but the verses are part of an oracle.  As such they require a particular understanding and careful interpretation.  They are commonly included in the Good Friday liturgy readings because of their aptness to the sufferings of Christ.  But what were the prophet’s intentions in describing the tribulations of his “suffering servant”?  It may have been in the hoped-for rise of a prophetic figure that would release the people from their exile and enable them to return to their home-land.  Many scholars now hold that the suffering servant is Israel in a collective sense.  Christians see them as a prophecy of the sufferings of Christ.  However to read them as a specific detailed historical literal description of the visage of Jesus of Nazareth some half-a-millenium after they were written is a step too far.  \nIn the case of the apostle Thomas needing to see the nail-holes and the wound in the side, the explanation is more simple.  He was not present when Jesus appeared to the others, and it as an expression of his incredulity that Jesus had risen and appeared to them.  When Jesus does appear to them again when Thomas is present, Thomas acknowledges him immediately.    \nBernard says he is convinced that the Shroud is not related to Jesus because of what the scriptures say.  In fact the image on the Shroud reflects the gospel accounts of Christ’s passion quite accurately, and they go further by being more forensically accurate than could be known to any medical science at the time of its discovery in medieval times.

She is known to have carried out repairs including replacing Valfre’s backing cloth with a red silk one. Significantly, 1868 was the last exposition permitted to be hand-held (Why? Resulting damage to the cloth when exhibited in this manner?) Subsequent expositions had to be carried out in a frame!

And yet a number of such pathologists have made detailed studies of the Shroud image wounds and concluded that they are precisely what one would expect. The ‘lance-wound’ for example was well-known to Roman gladiators engaged in mortal combat. The ‘Dying Gaul’ statue in Rome shows precisely this wound. Evidently the sculptor was familiar with it. The question of wrist-nailing is simply a matter of translation semantics. The Greek root ‘chiro-‘ refers to any area between the palm and the forearm. It is used in two biblical texts, John 20:25-27 (doubting Thomas)and in Acts 12:7 “The chains fell from his ‘hands’.” In both cases, ‘wrist’ is a valid translation, and is certainly more apt in the second text, and is now found in modern translations. However Jerome translated ‘chiro-‘ as ‘manus’ in both cases rather than ‘carpus’. Consequently generations of artists have shown a palm-nailed Christ.\nThere is a more fundamental question raised by Dr Berry’s general approach, and that is the role of skepticism in the attainment of certain knowledge, a question which has been debated by philosophers since the ancient Greeks and well into modern times. A persistent skepticism is in fact self-defeating, as it asserts that no certain knowledge is attainable, which is in fact an assertion about knowledge. Kierkegaard was of the view that ultimately, knowledge could only rest on a kind of faith. Skepticism serves as a useful check on rash speculation, but one certainly cannot live by it, without going insane. But if Kierkegaard is correct, I wonder what it is that Dr Berry places his faith in. Is it his profession? Is it himself? Is it some vague notion of proper standards in scientific investigation? I suspect it is probably not some personal view of a Deity, but I could be wrong. Perhaps he is not so very different from the rest of us, and lives by the balance of probabilities and likelihoods.

Apparently “sloppy science” is not to include dogmatic conclusions from non-representative samples satisfying no formal protocol when it comes to C-14 dating. \nWiki has some interesting observations on cotton. Although used in Mexico from the 5th millemium BCE, in the Old World its origin is in India.  It was unknown to the Greeks and Arabs before Alexander’s excursions took him to the Indus. Subsequently it was used in Iran, but there is little contemporary info on its cultivation there. Even in 1350 AD, it was little understood in northern Europe, and there were preposterous stories even then about lambs growing on trees in India whose branches bent down so they could feed. There was an active cotton trade which seems confined to the Middle East up until roughly the end of the first millenium CE. All this tends to constrain the time and place of cotton contamination on the TS. If the TS were of European medieval origin then the cotton would have had to been added some time well after 1350, as it seems that cotton was virtually unknown there beforehand. This would make it a subsequent contamination. One old suggestion mentioned by Wilson in 1978 is that the linen cloth may have been woven on Middle Eastern looms previously used to weave cotton. However others have claimed that the only cotton present is in the Raes sampling area. All this points to the likelihood that the cotton is a relatively late addition, probably deliberate, in order to effect a repair. It would seem that this repair is what the C-14 laboratories accurately dated to the 14th century. But of course it may have been skewed by the much older linen cloth, lacking vanillin, and the repair could have been much later than the 14th century.\n\n","date":"June 26, 2013 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/25/cotton/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Cotton"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I note that the torso negative image above appears to have been flipped horizontally.

It is interesting that the illustration in the Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter shows the type of weapons that are reflected in the scourging wounds on the Shroud.\n\n","date":"May 26, 2014 at 5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/25/dissent-of-the-day-ill-say-one-thing-for-jones/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dissent of the day:  I’ll say one thing for Jones"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh, your persistent skepticism in the face of evidence to the contrary is starting to become just a tad too boring!

There are plenty of the marks of this on the Shroud.  They are scattered over the whole body, from the shoulders to the lower part of the legs.  Most of them are to be seen on the back portion which proves that Jesus was bound with His face to the column, with His hands above Him, for there are no marks on the forearms which are quite visible.  These could not have failed to receive some blows, if they had been bound lower down.  A considerable number of marks are however to be found on the chest.” \n“One must add that only those blows have left a mark which produced an excoriation or a contused wound.  All those which only caused ecchymosis (a severe bruise) have left no mark on the Shroud.  Altogether I have counted more than 100, perhaps 120.  This means that if there were two thongs, that Our Lord received  about sixty strokes apart from those which left no mark.” \n“All the wounds have the same shape, like a little halter about three centimetres long.  The two circles represent the balls of lead, while the line joining them is the mark of the thong.” \n“They are nearly in pairs of two parallel wounds, which makes me think that each flagrum had two thongs, and they are laid out in the shape of a fan, the centre of which would be the executioner’s hand.  On the thorax they are oblique, horizontal on the loins, and oblique once more on the legs.  At this level, one can see in the frontal image long oblique furrows (similar to the halter-like wounds at the back), which must have been produced by the ends of the thongs.  Having struck the calves of the legs with their leaden balls, they have turned round the outer edge of the leg and lashed the front with their points.”\n[Comments on evidence of complete nakedness of subject during scourging]  \n  “Finally there must have been two executioners.  It is possible that they were not of the same height, for the obliqueness is not the same on each side.”\n“Doctor at Calvary”, Pierre Barbet, pp.91-92. \nMy comments:  There is clearly some difference from Barbet’s interpretation and the reconstructed flagrum shown in Plate 9D of Ian Wilson’s “The Shroud” 2010.  Barbet claims two thongs (the wounds occurring in pairs), plate 9D has three thongs.  Further, Barbet envisages that the pellets were at some distance from the ends of the thongs allowing the lash to whip around to the front;  whereas plate 9D shows the pellets at the ends.  My personal belief is that the flagrum was probably the sort of weapon that varied quite a lot in design according to the taste and particular sadism of its user or designer, as well as what materials were readily to hand. \nI think it significant that a definite pattern of scourge marks is evident, consistent with how one might envisage a scourging as a formal part of execution might occur.  These were not a random pattern of marks that might occur during any masochistic orgy of flagellants, but were clearly a formal execution.  As for the marks being a forgery, Barbet concludes by saying:  \n“Painters have been content with, at the most, vague, formless excoriations;  is there one of them who could have imagined and realised these minute details?”  \nI am also aware that there have been additional investigations by Italian researchers, who claim evidence of a different kind of whipping like the sort from lictors’ fasces, to “encourage?” the condemned to complete the journey to the final place of execution.  I’ll leave any comment on this to another time.\n\n","date":"May 28, 2014 at 8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/25/dissent-of-the-day-ill-say-one-thing-for-jones/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dissent of the day:  I’ll say one thing for Jones"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"However the placement of the Shroud at the time of wrapping, whether loosely wrapped, or tightly wrapped as Max has frequently asserted on biblical grounds and Jewish burial conventions, the fact remains that at the time of image formation, the cloth was so disposed as to produce an orthogonal image.

I consider that Mario Latendresse’s experiments and analysis come closer to the mark, certainly at the time of image formation.  By some means or another the cloth was close to being near parallel to the front and back of the body.  The absence of geometrical distortion argues for it.  A tight wrapping at the time of image formation would not show the near orthogonal image that it does and the sides of the body would also be visible, which it doesn’t.   Only if the sides of the body were packed with burial spices when the sides would then be masked and the cloth be near flat across the body, could tight wrapping be admitted as a possibility.

Not only was cotton (gossypium herbaceum = ME origin) present in Piece 1, absent in Piece 2;  But there was a size difference in the threads.  [Thread size is measured in “tex” = grams per km]  (As I understand from Thibault, he discovered cotton was interwoven with linen threads.)   \nThe warp threads were a near but not exact match:  Piece 1 = 16.3 tex; Piece 2 = 18 tex;\nThere was a more significant difference in the weft threads:  Piece 1 = 53.6 tex;  Piece 2 = 73.1 tex. \nI would presume that Raes took what he considered to be representative values, or they may be some kind of average.  The original linen threads would be hand spun, and so some variation might be expected.  But the weft difference seems significant to me.  As the corner was vulnerable from handling during expositions, the decision may have been taken to replace or add-in some new linen threads. \nThe give-away is the fact that dyes and/or lakes were used to disguise at least some of the material.

For example, if say the material was added in only a year ago, then I should think the proportion would be very much less than two-thirds.  \nMarino & Benford speculated that repairs were carried out by the Dowager Duchess of Savoy, Margaret of Austria, the same whose silver casket melted in the 1532 fire damaging the cloth.

This would make it extremely difficult to ascertain whether any future samples taken for C-14 testing come from a patched area or not. It would be necessary to search for other clues such as signs of gum arabic, dye azarin etc. It illustrates the hazard of C-14 testing on the Shroud, assuming of course that reliable C-14 testing of textiles is indeed feasible.

The founder of the house of Savoy was Humbert I the Whitehanded (mid-11th century), who held the county of Savoy and other areas east of the Rhône River and south of Lake Geneva and who was probably of Burgundian origin. His successors during the Middle Ages gradually expanded their territory.   By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), Victor Amadeus II (reigned 1675–1730) was raised in 1713 from duke to the status of a king as ruler of Sicily; in 1720 he exchanged Sicily for Sardinia. He and his successors also acquired important territory in northeastern Italy.  \nFrom 1453 until 1577, the Holy Shroud was housed in Chambery, except for a short sojourn 1535-61 in Turin after which it was then returned to Chambery.  In 1578, it was moved to the new Savoy capital of Turin, and eventually housed in the Guarini chapel in 1668 by Duke Charles Emmanuel.  \nThe accession of Charles Albert in 1831 contributed to the cause of Italian unification by a modernisation of government and the granting of a constitution under Piedmontese leadership and fighting against Austrian power during the war of independence 1848-49.  Under Victor Emmanuel  II (reigned 1849-78) the kingdom of Italy was formed in 1861 with the House of Savoy at its head.  In the new state the role of the monarch lost its former prominence as a parliamentary system of government evolved. The king was in a pivotal position only in times of crisis.  Victor Emmaunel III remained as figurehead king during the Fascist regime, abdicating in favour of his son Umberto II in 1946, at the conclusion of WWII hostilities, when Italy then became a republic. \nNevertheless Umberto II as head of Savoy but in self-imposed exile, clearly continued to assert his claim of ownership of the Shroud until his death in 1983, when his will bequeathed it to the Pope and his successors.  As far as is known, the Italian government as such has never asserted any claim of ownership, nor did the Italian government ever challenge the terms of the will making this bequest.  \nClearly the ownership of the Shroud was properly to be considered as severable from any state property of the House of Savoy, and it is therefore a grave error to presume that the Shroud at any time ever belonged to the Italian state government.  \nIt also appears to be a grave misapprehension of the Turinese guardians as to their proper role which does not extend to ownership.  They are merely guardians, and should not presume otherwise, as their actions have sometimes indicated such a misperception.  \nI might mischievously suggest that the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople may have a greater claim to ownership of the Shroud than any person or institution in Turin!\n\n","date":"September 7, 2015 at 7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“These are tiny details, of the kind daveb usually thinks I make too much of, … ”  \nHugh you are taking my name in vain quite unjustifiably.

Despite his exile after 1946, it seems clear enough that Umberto II still considered he had a right of proprietorship over the Shroud, declining to grant permission for any scientific investigation until 1969.  Thus not until Cardinal Pellegrino’s Commision was any agreement reached, Umberto’s representative on that commission being Prof Luigi Gedda.  Fr Rinaldi had also considered it wise to consult Umberto as part of his prior lobbying for the 1978 STURP investigation.  \nFollowing the death of Umberto in 1983, a greater sense of proprietorship seems to have been presumed by the Turin authorities, notwithstanding Umberto’s bequest of the Shroud to the Pope and his successors.  This was evident in Prof Gonella’s hostile reaction to the protocols specified by the Pontifical Science Advisor Prof Chagas for the 1988 radiocarbon dating, and the disastrous setting aside of those protocols, and the deliberate exclusion of the knowledgable STURP team.  Instead we had what seems to have been a tragi-comedy circus of a two hour discussion between Profs Riggi and Gonella, to discuss where a single sample was to be taken, and the most ill-suited choice eventuated.  One might also see it in the lack of adequate consultation in the 2002 so-called restoration, with the consequential loss of material information, a result that appears to many to have been caused by incompetent ignorance.   \nIn the monasteries of medieval times, an abbott was solely responsible for the principal decisions concerning his monastery, but he was always obliged to consult all those who might have an input or be affected by his decisions beforehand.

The debate is even reflected in some of Paul’s epistles, which sometimes express a preference for celibacy. Obviously no religious group can survive indefinitely without some form of marriage, otherwise it would die out. \nThe fragment would therefore seem to emanate from within such a group trying too hard to make a case for marriage by attempting to claim that Jesus himself was married. \nThe fact that one of the laboratories returned a Ptolemaic date for the fragment, while other tests placed both fragment and the control samples in the 7th-8th century AD, must raise critical questions concerning C-14 dating of such artifacts, obviously only too relevant to the dating of the TS.\n\n","date":"April 11, 2014 at 4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/11/funny-that-when-it-comes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-the-carbon-testing-must-be-considered-watertight-scientific-proof/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Funny that when it comes to the Shroud of Turin the carbon testing must be considered watertight scientific proof."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Carbon dating is suspect for several reasons which have been interminably argued on this site.

Sheep numbers peaked in 1982 with 70 million sheep, about 22 per person.  It has declined since then whereas the human population has increased so that the ratio now stands at only about 7.2 sheep per person, still higher than Australia’s at less than 5 sheep per person.  Cattle, beef and dairy also outnumber humans in NZ and are about 10 million.  Australian sheep stations are much larger than NZ’s and can cover several thousand square kilometres, think Kent and Essex plus a few smaller counties. \nHugh’s 60 or 70 sheep (I guess they don’t have so many sheep in UK) are actually Carbon-14 atoms, and the paddock he has them in is actually one small field in the whole property.  Unfortunately Hugh’s sheep don’t have ear tags, so he doesn’t know if they belong on the property or not.  It so happens that this field is on the very edge of the property, and the fences are poor and derelict, and several of the sheep have strayed into the field from the neighbouring countryside.  It is in fact quite impossible to tell which sheep here belong to the farmer and which ones are strays.  It is in fact quite possible that the farmer does have only four of his own sheep in this small field and the rest are strays.  The farmer would dearly like to know how many sheep he has on the whole property.  Knowing the state of his fences, it would be quite foolish of him to extrapolate the number of sheep in this one small field on the edge of the property with all its strays, and to attempt to estimate his ovine population from that.  It would be much more pertinent to select a few representative fields, perhaps in the heart of the property, count the sheep there, and then to do his sums. \nI trust the analogy I have outlined is sufficiently clear now, and that the point is taken.\n\n","date":"May 24, 2014 at 8:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/24/stephen-jones-the-kgb-allegedly-executed-both-shroud-of-turin-hackers/","cat":"hacking","title":"Stephen Jones: The KGB allegedly executed both Shroud of Turin Hackers"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Sorry, but not even John Bull, sheep farmer extraordinaire, can identify one Carbon-14 atom from another.

Subsequently in 1978, the STURP team failed to find cotton elswhere within the cloth, apart from minor surface detritus. The conclusion therefore had to be revised that the area around Piece 1 was somehow unique. This is the area from where the C14 samples were taken. \nCharles: “Are you suggesting that these elusive invisible weavers were actually able to reproduce banding so perfectly that the STURP photographs did not show the reweave?”  Yes!! \nFirstly these “invisible weavers” are hardly elusive. One of the modern practioners consulted by Benford & Marino are identified as Mr. Michael Ehrlich of ‘Without A Trace, Inc.’ in Chicago. Its website (www.withoutatrace.com) may be consulted to discover the type of work they do.

They make a case for Savoy dowager duchess Margaret of Austria as carrying out the repairs. In her time 1520-60 there were some 30 to 40 master weavers prominently known throughout France, most quite capable in the skills of French reweaving. Others have suggested that the work may have been commissioned by Princess Clotilde following the 1868 exposition. Clotilde would have had access to such resources. Flury-Lemburg was apparently unaware of the art, notwithstanding her knowledge of ancient textiles. She clearly believed that such mending would have been apparent on the under-side, whereas the practice of “invisible reweavers” was to make the mending invisible on both sides. \nCSB: “So typical of this site.

Raes, Rogers, and now Heimburger, have been able to identify or verify it.  It demonstrates that the sample was not representative of the whole, but we do not know the extent of this interference.  It is significant that Rogers found vanillin in the area, whereas none was apparent in other threads examined.  The whole exercise is an object lesson in the need for representative sampling.  The choice of site was unhappily influenced by the understandable concerns to conserve the integrity of the relic. \nIt is interesting that Fanti’s mechanical dating tests indicated a much earlier age, even though with a much greater range of error.  However I note from Colin’s recent tests, that sulphuric acid has the effect of weakening linen but not cotton.  It would seem a remote but real possibility therefore that if the image was produced by an acid process that Fanti’s results may have been skewed by this factor. \nI have been doing a little reading up on aragonite.  It has exactly the same chemical formula as calcite, CaCO3.  However common calcite occurs in a rhombohedral form with Ca surrounded by six closest oxygen atoms, and generally seems to be produced by sea calcium combining with dissolved CO2.  Aragonite is orthorhombic in structure with Ca surrounded by nine closest O atoms.  Another associate mineral is dolomite, nominally CaMg(CO3)2, similar to the calcite structure but with Mg and Ca occupying the metal cation sites in alternative layers.  Other dolomite associates occur with manganese and iron substituting for the magnesium. \nAragonite is the form that occurs in mollusc shells and in pearls.  It can degenerate to calcite over the course of geological time, but is stable in cool environments, and so occurs in the limestones of caves and other cool locations.  Aragonite is much less common than calcite, but is certainly common enough, and hardly as rare as suggested by some writers.  \nWhat is significant is that a few of the Ca atoms in aragonite can be substituted by barium, strontium and lead, but occur in various proportions at different locations.  Kohlbeck’s Shroud and Jerusalem tomb samples of aragonite included traces of iron and strontium but no lead.  Clearly there ought to be the potential of quantifying the iron and strontium as markers in these samples to determine a match.  If there were a match, then it would seem fairly conclusive, that despite the general prevalence of aragonite, that the Shroud aragonite could then be definitely associated with the Jerusalem aragonite.  The tests could be corroborated by control samples of aragonite from other locations. \nUnfortunately the aragonite dust on the Shroud was removed along with other debris by the notorious 2002 restoration.  It is rumoured that such debris is stored and catalogued somewhere in Turin.  If it were made available, it might just be possible to test the strontium iron and any other markers to see if they do indeed match the content of Jerusalem aragonite.  \nThe history of Shroud research seems to be fraught with the well-meaning incompetence of those in ill-advised authority.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2015 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It’s conclusive that the sample area is anomalous.

It cannot be interpreted outside that single sample as being representative of the entire Shroud cloth.  \nIf the test failed (as it seems to have done), then there are two possibilities:  Either a) this sample was not homogeneous as divided among the three laboratories; Or b) the testing methods between the three laboratories have an intrinsic systematic error, yielding different ages for a homogeneous sample.  Given what is now known of the sample, then a) would seem to be the more likely. \nIf on the other hand, the chi test had succeeded, it could only be interpreted as: Both c) the sample, and only this sample, was adequately homogeneous within normal limits of error; And d) the methods used by the three laboratories could be asserted as evidently mutually consistent.  But e) it could not be asserted that the results are adequately representative of the entire cloth, as representative samples were not taken. \nThe more usual and conventional use of a chi square test, is to apply it to a full range of samples, alleged to be representative.  If that test failed, then it could be concluded that the samples were either not truly representative, or that the cloth is heterogeneous.  \nSo that fundamentally, the only value that this particular test had, was as a comparison between the three laboratories, and as a test on the homogeneity of the single sample.

There are clearly agendas at work, not only from Dr King’s religio-feminism, but also from those with an opposing religious viewpoint, particularly from those with an evangelical bent. So far I have seen little that either proves or disproves authenticity. The papyrus C-14 date range 650-870CE may show that it is not an original 4th century text or not, depending on how much confidence one is prepared to assign to these particular tests.  That another laboratory can come up with a Ptolemaic date for the same artifact must raise questions on the method. We have seen enough debate on this site for the 1988 dating of the TS, to know that not all are prepared to accept the method as infallible and that issues can arise. \nThe use of papyrus as a writing medium was replaced in the West by parchment and vellum around the 3rd century.  However it continued to be cultivated and used by the Arabs of Egypt down to the 9th century when the making of paper from other plant fibres rendered papyrus unnecessary. However the use of papyrus for books and documents continued sporadically down to the 12th century. \nIf there is any substance to the 650-870 dating, then it may be that the fragment is part of a later copy of an earlier gnostic text, or not. It is equally conceivable that notwithstanding the dating results, that it is indeed a 4th century original. And of course it may just as equally be the work of a master forger. We have been here before! \nOne aspect that begs further discussion is the Rahman spectroscopy tests on the ink, which would seem to place the fragment in ancient times.

In 1988 the Vatican’s scientific advisor, Brazilian-born Professor Carlos Chagas had put forward a well-reseached protocol, involving seven named laboratories some using the old Libby, others the new AMS methods.  This was rejected by the Turin guardians, Cardinal Anastasio Ballastrero and Professor Luigi Gonella, despite the higher professional standing of Chagas.  The Turin street-fighters won out.  Incredibly, it was only when the scientists were assembled immediately prior to the sampling that Gonella and his close friend Giovanni Riggi began to deliberate on the best location for a SINGLE sample, a debate that took them two hours.

I am sceptical that any trend has any true significance concerning the Shroud, for the following reasons:  1) I cannot imagine that the very small corner sample taken can in any way be representative of the whole; 2) The work of Rogers in stating that the sample had significant levels of vanillin and cotton contamination indicates that the sample could not be representative; 3) The sample therefore appears to be a patch; 4) I have seen enough costly errors made during my technical career resulting from poorly informed extrapolation of non-representative data;  5) Based on what else we can deduce about the age of the Shroud, I would expect to see a jump in the results rather than a persistence in the alleged trend, that is if C14 has any relevance to this artifact, which indeed seems to be in some question. \nI am intrigued that Gabriel sees C14 as an obsolete technique.

I have yet to read the paper in detail, but already some comments occur to me.  \nGazay makes the assumption that Shroud & Mandylion were one and the same object, thus following the Ian Wilson theory, which is commonly challenged by Byzantine Art historians and others.  It is curious that the Calvary has the likeness of the Mandylion presentation in a frame showing landscape aspect.  If they were the same object, then in 1304, already the Mandylion would have been taken out of its frame, and be then recognised as the Shroud.  It is unlikely that it would then be reinstated in its frame.  If so this would have happened well before 1204, when the Shroud was then known (Patriarch of Constantiople’s complaint to Pope on crusaders’ despoliation).  Alternatively they were in fact two separate objects – possibly the Mandylion was a copy of the face on the Shroud, hence the alleged likeness.  \nDaniel Scavone has maintained the view that the Knights Templar worship of a head was a fabrication by the inquisitors who had previously  levelled the same charge against the Cathars.  Any Templar admissions of the head were generally made by lowly ranked knights who would not have been privy to the secrets of the inner circle.  It is therefore not conclusive that the Templars did in fact worship a head.\nHowever some Templars may have known about the Shroud, particularly if they had some links or association with the families of Othon de la Roche or the de Charnays, notwithstanding that Breton is on the west of France and Lirey / Bensancon are in the east.  The Templars would still be active in 1304, as the first arrests under Philip the Fair did not occur until 1307, Jaques de Molay being burnt at the stake in 1314.\nWhen I first saw the article, I immediately thought of the keramion, the clay tile said to be found with the Mandylion in Edessa about 525 AD.

I also note that Mme Flury-Lemburg still appears to be in denial over the possibility of “reweaving”, despite the fact that Michael Ehrlich routinely carries out such invisible reweaving at the present time (or at any rate in 2005 when the paper was written). Flury-Lemburg’s understanding of such reweaving is that it would be evident on the backside of the cloth, whereas Ehrlich’s more painstaking process does not. I also note the Preface comment: \n“This paper was peer-reviewed by two scholarly history journals, Viator and the Journal of Medieval History. Neither journal suggested any major or substantive corrections. The minor amendments suggested by the peer reviewers were included in the final version of this paper.”\nThe matter I have a problem with is due to an attributed comment by the custodian’s scientific advisor Prof Piero Savarino: “In the 1998 booklet, he stated that the 1988 C-14 testing might have been erroneous due to “extraneous thread left over from ‘invisible mending’ routinely carried out in the past on parts of the cloth in poor repair” (Savarino and Barberis, 1998: 21).” This clearly suggests that there are other areas of patching on the Shroud which may be either known or unknown.\nA fairly recent comment by Thibault Heimburger stated that no cotton was found anywhere else on the Shroud, only the area from which the C-14 samples were taken. I can only conclude if the two separate comments by both Savarino and Heimburger are both correct, that it was mere chance that the C-14 sample included a cotton thread (although there was also said to be gum arabic and other clues) and the more usual procedure in such work would be to remove such extraneous cotton thread on its completion. It is strangely coincidental that the one area of the cloth which was used for the C-14 testing was also the only area that included remnant cotton.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2013 at 5:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/16/paper-chase-nobody-goes-to-the-trouble-oh-yes-they-might/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase:  Nobody Goes to the Trouble.

Her involvement with Shroud studies was considerable including: obtaining microscope slides of Jerusalem flora for matching with the Frei samples, her studies of tombs in Jerusalem, and her work wih Kohlbeck and Otterbein, identifying the dirt on the Shroud as Jerusalem travertine aragonite limestone. \nAn excerpt from a letter to Fr Otterbein includes the following:\n“Limestone (calcium) samples were collected from as far south\nas 30 miles from Jerusalem to as far north as the Galilee and Mt. Carmel.  As previously reported, Kohlbeck and Damian had matched a heavy calcium concentration from the foot area on the Shroud of Turin to samples collected in Jerusalem. This evidence was called into question, so sampling around Israel was performed to assertain if such a test was valid. From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Therefore, the match between Jerusalem and the shroud is a valid one. The Shroud of Turin was indeed in Jerusalem at one time during its history.” \nClearly Dr Nitowski was convinced that the TS had Jerusalem provenance. But like so many other studies it seems open to the criticism that it was not subject to peer review. Is the evidence still available? Can her tapes, slides, record of results be otherwise confirmed? As part of the 2002 “Restoration”, the TS was vacuum cleaned! Some say that the dust was collected and classified. I wonder?

Jesus himself seems to have come from a Galilean middle-class background with the trade of a carpenter (tekton). If there were oppressors, these could only be the Romans, but the real enemy of the early Christians is painted as the Jewish establishment. St Paul himself seems to have been an educated man with the trade of a tent-maker, joined the sect of the Pharisees, and as those who stoned Stephen lay their cloaks at his feet (like a football coach), he clearly had some influence there. A Roman centurion is not too proud to ask Jesus to heal his servant. The disciples are able to find supporters among influential women. This does not paint a picture of desparate down-trodden serfs looking for revolution. Jesus’ message was revolutionary, “Blessed are the poor”, the parable of Dives and Lazarus, his liberating attitude towards women, turning the existing conventions upside-down. The disciples do not at first embrace the story of the Resurrection, but have to be convinced before they can accept it. And then these same disciples are prepared to give their lives for it. The enemy is not seen as exploitative slavers, but those who will not believe. It is only later in Revelations that we see the Roman persecutions arising from the refusal to accept deification of the emperors.

In the Breton Calvary described by Francois Gazay, the figure appears to be cherub-like (a head with wings), which Gazay says implies that this veil was not made by human-hands.  Gazay also claims to identify certain Shroud-like facial features in the 1304 Breton Calvary.  These are probably not so apparent in the Tronoen case. \nThe story of the Veronica begins with the 2nd-century so-called proto-“Acts of Pilate” which the early church Fathers knew about, but these Acts were redacted and added to over the next 150 years or so, and the legend of Veronica grew and developed with the redactions accordingly. \nA few factors incline me to some skepticism about the story of the Veronica, along with the Mandylion.  We may acknowledge that there is some kernel of truth behind all such legends, but much of the time we can never know for certain what that kernel is.  Even allowing for Jewish aversion to images (and remember Luke was not a Jew), is it not surprising that in spite of having at least three such tales of Christ creating an image of himself, not one of them is mentioned in any of the gospels (not even Luke).  We have the Doctrine of Addai (Abgar legend) the Veronica, and the image we know on the Shroud.  Early portraits of Christ show him as a beardless Adonis, and St Augustine had no idea of what he looked like, despite three possible putative genuine portraits.  \nI suspect that both the tales of the Veronica and the Mandylion were the result of a type of “Chinese Whispers” emanating from rumours concerning the Shroud image, which only a select few knew about.  At some time the Shroud image was copied – perhaps its identity as a burial cloth was concealed as postulated by Wilson.  As these copies spread, perhaps the Veronica and Mandylion legends became associated with a few of the superior copies.  This would account for the common likenesses in the various reproductions, assertions of three distinct image creations, while allowing separate identities for the three objects.  \nI merely offer this as an interesting speculation, which I think has more credibility than other attempts at explanations.\n\n","date":"February 21, 2013 at 3:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/20/paper-chase-and-historical-c14-challenge-relations-of-a-breton-calvary-with-the-shroud-and-the-templar-knights/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase and Historical C14 Challenge: Relations of a Breton Calvary with the Shroud and the Templar Knights"}],"dna":[{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The notion that Jesus is both truly God and truly Man will I think always remain a mystery hidden from our eyes.  With the greater understanding we now have of the science of genetics, perhaps as expressed in our knowledge of human chromosomes, we ask: “If Jesus did not have a human father, how can he be truly man?  Conversely if he did have a human father, how can he be truly God?”  The traditional response has always been that he obtained his human nature solely from Mary, and his divine nature from being conceived by her being overshadowed by the Holy Spirit.  But the modern question of chromosomes now arises and remains with us. \nThe enigma certainly created problems for the early church fathers, as any review of the patristic literature certainly demonstrates.  But they saw the problem through the perspectives of classical Greek philosophy, rather than through our modern scientific perspective.  It led to many divisions within the early church, and the efforts to wrestle with the problem led to a variety of heresies.  \nPerhaps the most critical of these heresies was that of Arius, which prompted Constantine I to summon the Council of Nicea in 323.  Arius had attracted a large following through a message integrating Neoplatonism, which accented the absolute oneness of the divinity as the highest perfection, with a literal, rationalist approach to the New Testament texts.  He had taught that Christ is not divine but a created being.  The council condemned Arius and, with reluctance on the part of some, incorporated the nonscriptural word homoousios (“of one substance”) into the Nicene Creed to signify the absolute equality of the Son with the Father. The emperor then exiled Arius.  \nThe Council of Nicaea, in May 325, declared Arius a heretic after he refused to sign the formula of faith stating that Christ was of the same divine nature as God. Influential support from colleagues in Asia Minor and from Constantia, the emperor Constantine I’s daughter, succeeded in effecting Arius’ return from exile and his readmission into the church after consenting to a compromise formula. Shortly before he was to be reconciled, however, Arius collapsed and died while walking through the streets of Constantinople.  \nThe enigma had also I think created problems even for the gospel writers.  When did each believe that Jesus became God?  For Mark it is at his baptism by John the baptizer in the waters of the Jordan, when John sees the Holy Spirit descending on Jesus in the form of a dove and hears a voice from heaven affirming that this is God’s Son;  For both Matthew and Luke, it is right from the time of his conception, so they tell the story of the Annunciation by an angel.  But for the evangelist John, it is even before the beginning of time: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.”  \nBut the evangelist John also inserts in the same chapter, Mark’s story of the baptism: “John testified further, saying, “I saw the Spirit come down like a dove from the sky and remain upon him. I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘On whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain, he is the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit.’ Now I have seen and testified that he is the Son of God.”  \nThe enigma continues, and from whatever any limited human perspective we attempt to comprehend it, I think it will remain a divine mystery to our limited understanding.  Perhaps that is how it should be, and is intended to be part of the mysterium tremendum,  How can a finite mind comprehend a God who is infinite?\n\n","date":"December 8, 2015 at 10:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/08/jesus-the-xx-male/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Jesus, the XX Male"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I perceive a different aspect of this story.

By whom? How authoritative? “It was a common enough practice”? And that proves what? ”  \nNabber, my position is that I think very little can be proved conclusively.  I am only reporting what I read from an authoritative source, which, succinctly, results from the analyses and consequent opinions of reputable exegetes who have studied these problems.  \nThe authors of these particular sections from the Biblical Literature article I mentioned above would have included:  The Rev. Krister Stendahl: Bishop of Stockholm, 1984-88. Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Divinity, Harvard University, 1981-84; Dean, Divinity School, 1968-79. Author of Paul Among Jews and Gentiles and others. … …Emilie T. Sander: Associate Professor of New Testament, Yale University, 1973-75. Coeditor and translator of The Bible and the Role of Women.  \nThe article’s introduction to the Pauline Letters states:\n“In the New Testament canon of 27 books, 21 are called “letters,” and even the Revelation to John starts and ends in letter form. Of the 21 letters, 13 belong to the Pauline corpus; the Letter to the Hebrews is included in the Pauline corpus in the East but not, however, in the West. Three letters of this corpus, the Pastoral Letters, are pseudonymous and thus are not considered here.” \n“Of the remaining 10, the Letters to the Colossians and Ephesians are from the hand of a later Pauline follower and II Thessalonians is spurious. How this Pauline corpus was collected and published remains obscure, but letters as part of Holy Scripture were an early established phenomenon of Christianity.”  \n“The letters of Paul, written only about 20-30 years after the crucifixion, were preserved, collected, and eventually “published.” In general, they answered questions of churches that he had founded. When all the Pauline Letters as a corpus were first known is difficult to determine. Because Pauline theology and some quotations and allusions were certainly known at the end of the 1st century, the Pauline Letters probably were collected and circulated for general church use by the end of the 1st century or soon thereafter. A disciple of Paul, possibly Onesimus, may have used Ephesians as a covering letter for the whole collection.”  \nConcerning the Authorship status of the three Pastoral Letters to Timothy and Titus, it is stated:\n“The Muratorian Canon (a list of biblical books from c. 180 includes references to the Pastoral Letters and notes that they were written “for the sake of affection and love.” They have a place in the canon because “they have been sanctified by an ordination of the ecclesiastical discipline.” These letters, however, do not appear among the Pauline letters in P 46, an early-3rd-century manuscript, and there is no clear external attestation in the primitive church concerning them until the end of the 2nd century.” \n“… … Linguistic facts-such as short connectives, particles, and other syntactical peculiarities; use of different words for the same things; and repeated unusual phrases otherwise not used in Paul-offer fairly conclusive evidence against Pauline authorship and authenticity.”  \nYou are entitled to a different opinion, if you so choose, and I respect it.

My conclusion – if the image had ever been painted, there was no sign of any paint residues in 1532. \n3)“Bands of different-colored yarn can be observed in the weave of the cloth (figure 3). Where darker bands intersect image areas, the image is darker. This proves that the image color is not solely a result of reactions in the cellulose of the linen. Something on the surface of the different batches of yarn produced color and/or accelerated color formation. The observations of bands of color agree with historical reports on the methods used to produce ancient linen. They indicate a very mild bleaching technique, unlike that used after the last crusade in AD 1291” – p.5.  Observation would imply that manufacture of cloth predates 1291.  \n4)“The warp of ancient linen was protected with starch during weaving and the finished cloth was washed in Saponaria officinalis suds. Saponaria is hemolytic, which could explain why the old blood stains on the cloth are still red. Diane Soran (deceased) of Los Alamos, tested hemolysis on Saponaria-washed cloth before we went to Turin. The blood is still red on those 25-year-old samples. Controls are black.” – p.5.  Explanation of why blood stains have retained their red color. \n5)“Saponaria is toxic, and it is a potent preservative. A textile conservator told us that old cloths tend to be better preserved than newer ones. Comparison samples loaned to us by the amazing Museum of Egyptology in Turin were still supple, and several dated to several thousand years BC” – pp 5-6.  Charles F has noted that no other examples of Quem Quaeritis artefacts are known to survive.

Unlikely!  To non-involved scientists in other fields?  Only maybe!  For the benefit of his non-chemistry STURP colleagues?  Very possibly!  For the benefit of adequately informed persons interested in the Shroud, who might have some broad understanding of science?  Most likely! \nI am not a chemist.  I am a retired civil engineer, who succeeded in passing his necessary Chemistry Intermediate quallification, so that I might have some practical use for the subject in such fields as industrial painting technology, and materials engineering.  Nevertheless I find much of Roger’s general writing so chemistry dense, that I often find him a difficult read which I can seldom manage to persevere with.  By way of contrast I found the 2002 paper by Rogers and his co-author, a welcome and informing relief.  I did not find it inconsistent, perhaps some minor errors and omissions of little consequence – the man is human.  Despite its 30 pages, I did not have to baffled by a welter of over-whelming and unnecessarily insignificant technical detail. \nSo Hugh Farey might carp and nit-pick that the full details of the pre-tests of the pyrolysis effects on medieval paints are not included.  It is sufficient for me that a chemist of Rogers’ competence reports that he carried out such tests, but found no evidence of pyrolytic paint products on the Shroud.  Nor, if one excepts the loose cannon McCrone, did any other member of the STURP team.  That has to be significant, in that there were no detectable pyrolytic paint residues remaining as the result of the 1532 fire. I see it as dealing a death blow to the Quem Quaeritis hypothesis.  If the image was painted say in the 13th century for this purpose, then there ought to have been sufficient paint residues remaining in 1532 to have been affected by the fire and so be detectable in 1978. But there were not!\nRogers noted that saponaria is highly reactive, and gives some comprehensive details on this matter.  The banding persuaded him that the weave was of ancient manufacture, involving saponaria.  The superficiality of the image, persuaded him that the image resided on the coating, and this was reinforced by the fact that the image could be decolorised leaving intact cellulose fibres at the surface.  A colleague Diane Soran is reported as having shown that haemolysis products remain red when affected by saponaria, and this effect persisted.  Hugh Farey was unable to replicate this result, so perhaps he was using the wrong recipe. \nRogers also gave considerable attention to the detailed reasons why the 1988 radiocarbon sample was anomalous and therefore unrepresentative of the whole.  Nevertheless despite demonstrating this fact, Hugh Farey credulously maintains without good reason that the dating should stand.  \nIt certainly seems curious that if the Shroud is a sample of the Quem Quaeritis cloths, that it should be the only one to survive, and the likely conclusion would have to be that it is not one such, but dates from a much earlier period when cloth manufacture produced more durable linen. \nThe testy agnostic chemist Raymond Rogers could believe that the Shroud wrapped a crucified human body dating from ancient times.  The agnostic anatomist Yves De Lage believed that it wrapped the body of Jesus Christ.  The initially skeptical Orthodox Jew Barrie Schwortz is convinced that it is the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth.  But the Catholic science teacher, editor of the BSTS newsletter, cannot believe that his Lord and Master has left him the tangible material means by which he may advocate the reality and truth of His death and resurrection.\n\n","date":"March 17, 2015 at 3:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"… but considers it as no more than a toy for his intellectual recreation and amusement, content to give to dogs that which is sacred [Matt 6:7]\n\n","date":"March 17, 2015 at 4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I suspect that perhaps Heller, Adler and other scientists who had studied the Shroud, came to a conclusion that McCrone’s work lacked credibility because he only ever relied on his overly self-confident knowledge of microscopy, seemingly shunning other more recent methods of analysis such as spectrography.

The engineer never has that luxury.  He needs to come to a decision, no matter how difficult or intractable the problem, on time, inevitably a solution which he knows will at least satisfy.  He may take the advice of experts, and depending on his assessment of their reliability will factor in margins of safety. \nRogers does it for me, no matter how imperfect his work may be.regarded by purists, and at present he is the best that I can see.  His work is one among many other reasons that I regard the Shroud as the authentic burial cloth of Christ, and as such I consider it is the most precious relic we have of Him.  Most certainly it is potentially that, and so should be approached with proper reverence by the faithful.  It cannot be regarded as a mere toy for the mere purpose of a mental exercise.  \nJesus was no stranger to righteous anger, and I make little apology if I occasionally show a similar zeal in my comments. \nA Wellington man has just been sentenced to two and a half years jail for insulting the Buddha in Myanmar, despite his apologies to the judge.

This is shown by the widely scattered universal distribution of the various blood types.  Even such a basic quick search on Wikipedia points to it: Check: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system#Distribution_and_evolutionary_history\nThere are several other web-sites showing the universal distribution of blood types, and very likely more authoritative than Wikipedia.

It was expected that each race, and each population within each race, would have frequencies of certain ascertainable genes that would mark them off from other races.”\n“Information on blood groups was taken from large numbers of populations, but when scientists tried to show a correlation of blood group patterns with the conventional races, they found none. While populations differed in their blood group patterns, in such features as the frequencies of A, B, and O types, no evidence was found to document race distinctions.”\n“The internal variations within races have proved to be greater than those between races. ”\nIf AB originated in Hungary only 1000 years ago, we would expect to see this reflected in the geographical distribution of AB with higher percentages being clustered around central Europe and tailing off into the Middle East and Asia.  In actual fact we see significant percentages occuring in such widely scattered locations as: Korea, China, Turkey, Finland and Poland.  Adamo’s theory is clearly a nonsense, which seems to be the consensus of most geneticists.

If it is a spirit, it cannot be a body.  \n1.  It is possible that a spirit may be perceived by men because of a special divine dispensation.  Mystics and the scriptures refer to appearances of angels for instance.  In Matthew’s gospel, angels appear to St Joseph, but are said to have appeared to him “in a dream”.  But a spirit cannot be touched, nor does it eat food.  Normally a spirit cannot interact with the matter of our universe. \n2.  In the accounts of the resurrection, Jesus appears to the apostles (perception); Thomas “touches” his wounds; Jesus “walks” and “talks” with apostles on the way to Emmaus, he “sups” with them;  when they are gathered in the upper room, he asks if they have something to eat;  when they go fishing, he is seen preparing breakfast for them.  I assert that a spirit can do none of those things!  Therefore he has some kind of resurrected “body” !  \n3.  Normal matter cannot pass through walls;  Nor can normal matter spontaneously “appear” and “disappear”;  nor can it normally levitate itself into the clouds as the apostles saw at the Ascension.

Therefore the underlying assumption of homogeneity, the basis for a grab sample, is highly suspect.  \nWe all know that Raymond Rogers, the one chemist who was most familiar with the chemistry of the Shroud was convinced that he had detected such a repair at the site of the grab sample.  That is sufficient in itself to raise suspicion.  \nI would concur with the the main thrust of Antero’s comment, but with one exception:\n“A new radiocarbon sample should be done only after a mature analysis by experts from several fields of science namely textile, physics and chemistry.”  \nThe exception is omitting to mention the importance of representative sampling in any such analysis.  Even scientists with their specialist expertise are often unaware of the proper techniques involved in taking truly representative samples, and lack the necessary training in proper sampling theory.  They are more often focused on the complex technology of their own particular discipline, than they are of being aware of the complex mathematical techniques involved in the theory of Applied Statistics essential to a valid testable sampling regime.      \nThere is course a practicable problem in conserving the integrity of the relic, and it would seem likely that this was a significant factor in the choice of the 1988 sampling site.  Perhaps further testing would be better deferred to a later time when less intrusive testing might eventually become available.  \nIn the meantime, we may have to be satisfied with the fact of ongoing controversy among the diverse points of view.  However, because of the lack of representative sampling in 1988, I consider it an error of close-mindedness to make any kind of dogmatic assertions concerning the 1988 sampling.  Remember, that no other kind of tests on the sample, apart from radiocarbon dating, were permitted at that time!\n\n","date":"November 28, 2015 at 5:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/25/finally-an-explanation-for-the-exclamation-mark/","cat":"lectures","title":"Finally, An Explanation for the Exclamation Mark!"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think Ron may be incorrect in asserting that it was the regular practice to dump Jewish crucified bodies into a common or open grave, and that Jesus is the only know case of a decent burial.  Pierre Barbet was not only a highly competent pathologist, but he was also a competent scholar in the classics.  And this competency illuminates much of his book “A Doctor at Calvary”.  He is able to cite several classic authorities on the then current practices. Ron can find in Barbet’s work that relatives’ requests for the bodies of executed criminals were usually granted as a matter of form, and were only denied for the worst offences such as piracy, rebellion or general insurrection, or when the military wished to make an impression on the general population.  Barbet even comments that acceptance of bribes for the bodies was considered immoral by the Roman authorities.  \nComing now to Hugh’s question as to the identity of the TS man, I have another challenge for him and I’m about to raise the probability stakes. \nIt is known that there was such an object as the “The Image of Edessa”, which lies behind the 3rd century Abgar legend, or the Doctrine of Addai.  The principal in the legend is King Abgar V, a 1st century contemporary of Jesus, but which in reality more likely refers to King Abgar VIII the Great in the 2nd century and who is credited with establishing Christianity in the city by about 150 AD, certainly by 200 AD.  The “Image of Edessa” was said to be a miraculous portrait of Jesus, which soon afterwards disappeared, possibly to Antioch, but resurfaced in Edessa about 525 AD,  Very many copies of the “Image of Edessa” were made and distributed throughout eastern Christendom, including for example the Christ Pantocrator, along with many others.  The “Image of Edessa”, whatever it was, was eventually taken to Constantinople becoming part of the King’s relic collection.  \nNow Hugh can make any number of comparisons he likes with these various early portraits of Christ.  He will then discover, perhaps to his astonishment, that many of these very early portraits of Christ bear an uncanny resemblance to the facial image on the Shroud.  This was first observed by Paul Vignon around 1902.  The writer Ian Wilson made what he believed was a strong case for the Image of Edessa being the Shroud folded in such a way as to conceal its identity as a burial cloth.  Practically all Byzantine art historians disagree with him, but this is irrelevant to the thread of the present argument.    \nThe point is that standard likenesses of Christ were developed in the very early centuries of Christianity, which had as their basis an alleged image of him.  And these likenesses conform to the facial image of the TSM.  I agree that it is possible that these early Edessans and their various copyists might, just might have been mistaken as to the identity of the person on whatever the image was they happened to have.  But nevertheless it raises the probability stakes in the jigsaw, and it is becoming less circumstantial than ever.  \nWork with that one, Hugh!   Kind regards, daveb.\n\n","date":"January 28, 2013 at 5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/25/eric-j-jumper-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Eric J.

He completely demolishes the mythology theories, prevalent at the start of the 20th century and prompting Pius X’s condemnation of Modernism. The mythological approach appears to have been behind the efforts of Herbert Thurston and Ulysse Chevalier to discredit the Shroud, as Secondo Pia’s photographs, tended to support the traditional beliefs of the Church. These two gentlemen hoped to take the Church in a different direction, and so conspired to present Bishop D’Arcis’ so-called memorandum to Clement VII in a more persuasive way than could be justified by their improper exercise of scholarship. \n2) The traditional association of religion and science is an interesting one. In primal societies, it is the shaman who has all the arcane wisdom; it is evident in the Pacifica and Maori peoples for example where the schools of learning, including astronomy, navigation and other techical skills were taught by various tohunga with specialist expertise, frequently involving chants to be learnt by rote for the actual practioners. \nIn Ancient Egypt the mathematical and science skills for the various civil works were taught by skilled scribes in their schools, refer Rhind papyrus, copied by scribe Ahmes 1650BCE. In Babylon, however, mathematics and science remained the domain of a priestly caste. The Babylonians were extremely skilled, knowing at least 15 Pythagorean triples 1000 years before the time of Pythagoras, had calculated the square root of 2 to seven decimal places, had developed a base 60 place-holder system with a zero, and which was still used in astronomy up to medieval times until it was supplanted by the Indo-Arab denary system. \nIt was the Jewish exiles’ exposure to Babylonian science which resulted in their supplanting the Genesis anthropic Creation myth of Chapter 2, with the more elevated and scientific approach of Chapter 1. \n3) Pope Francis certainly seems to have the charisma and knows how to touch the hearts of the present age. But yet he is only another Apollos, Paul or Silas.

In reality most media outlets in the western world exist for one purpose only, to return a dividend to their shareholders.  Their employees climb onto this bandwagon knowing full well that in order to feed themselves and their families, they are expected to present their stories in as sensational way as they can, for this will sell their employer’s products and please the shareholders. \nNotice how this Associated Press reporter first creates the impression of report authenticity by commencing her report with factual quotations, which can be easily checked and confirmed, and consolidates this with a few paragraphs of objective factual commentary.

Judging from some of the sad comments on the linked web-site, a strong bitter anti-papal feeling and resentment is still evident among the Waldensian community, while yet another comment is curious that the Pope is visiting heretics.  Evidently a spirit of ecumenism has yet to spread its roots in that corner of the world. \nThe original Waldensian movement is one of the earliest reform groups, and dates from the preaching of Valdes in Lyon 1170-76.  At the Lateran Council of 1179, Valdes made a profession of orthodoxy and was confirmed in his vow of poverty by Pope Alexander III.  However Valdes did not receive the recognition he sought, was condemned by the archbishop of Lyon, and in 1184 Pope Lucius III placed the Waldensians under a ban.  Thereafter the Waldensians departed from orthodoxy, and the movement spread rapidly throughout Europe.  Rome responded vigorously turning from excommunication to active persecution and execution.  \nA number returned to orthodoxy, and by the end of the 15th century the movement was confined to the French and Italian valleys of the Cottian Alps.  A second period in their history began in 1526 when they were introduced to Reformation theology, and thereafter eventually becoming in effect a Swiss Protestant Church, with some emphasis on predestination and millenialism.  Years of persecution continued until they were granted full civil rights in 1848.  In the 19th century, a number of Waldensian emigrants migrated to Uruguay, and thence established a number of small communities in the United States. \nThe interest of Pope Francis in the Italian Waldensians seems to be connected to his own parents’ origins in the Po Valley, where he still has family, and which seems to remain a stronghold of the movement.  It seems typical of Francis that he reaches out to those most disconnected from the main stream, and always in a spirit of reconciliation.  He will be reinforced in the knowledge that the prayers of many will accompany him, in the hope of a fruitful and conciliatory outcome.\n\n","date":"June 2, 2015 at 5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/02/pope-francis-june-21-22-schedule-details/","cat":"2015","title":"Pope Francis’ June 21 & 22 Schedule Details"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"HF: “on balance, I don’t think the Shroud image was made by a dead body at all” \nI challenge Hugh to name any single known man-made.image, not a photograph of a known corpse, which has attracted anything like the same forensic interest as has the Shroud image.

I have some little acquaintance with geol maps from my Engineering Geology days.  \nThe convention is that the surface geology only is shown, and must be superposed on a contour map, to obtain the dips and strikes, and hence the geologist determines the sequence of the strata.  The legends provided with these maps fortuitously show the stratigraphy. There are several strata with interspersed limestone, dolomite  and chalk, and of course layers of alluvia, and also some flint. The limestone is extensive on the surface geology, but is not specifically labelled as aragonite.  From a comment by Nitoswki it would seem that only a limited area can be identified as aragonite, while much of it would seem to be calcite. \nThe area immediately north of Jerusalem is labelled ‘Kub’, coloured yellow, is the Bi’na formation in the Turonian strata, and comprises limestone interspersed with dolomite.  Kub pops up all over the place, roughly in a N-S strip.\nUnderlying Kub is the Kuw,(coloured green) the Weradin formation in the Cenomanian strata, generally dolomite, and generally lies to the west.  Overlying Kub is the Kum, the Menuha formation in the Senonian strata, mainly chalk, and generally lies to the east.  It would seem then that the strata generally dip to the west, with the more recent deposits being in the east at this location. . \nThe Shroud samples from soles of the feet, nose and knee analysed by Kohlbeck, were identified as aragonite.  He obtained several Jerusalem field samples from Nitowski from about nine different sites.   Now it seems that aragonite is indeed widely present and quite common in Jerusalem.  However:\n“Dr. Nitowsky (Sr. Damian of the Cross) sampled in Israel, nine sites which included:\n1. Emmaus; 2. Jericho, at Herod’s palace; 3. Qumran ; 4. Beth Shan ; 5 Sepphoris; 6 and 7 Beth She’arim; 8 Jerusalem; 9. Mt Carmel”. The Jerusalem samples are further identified as in the École Biblique tomb complex and more particularly from the bench of the tomb.”\nShe spoke of Limestone (calcium) and not properly of Aragonite. The nine different test sites in Israel were also analysed. The limestone throughout the nine sites changes and she claims that it does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Only the sample taken from the Jerusalem tomb matched the limestone on the Shroud.” \nAlso Excerpt from a letter to Father Otterbein by Dr. Nitowski\n“Limestone (calcium) samples were collected from as far south as 30 miles from Jerusalem to as far north as the Galilee and Mt. Carmel.  As previously reported, Kohlbeck and Damian had matched a heavy calcium concentration from the foot area on the Shroud of Turin to samples collected in Jerusalem. This evidence was called into question, so sampling around Israel was performed to ascertain if such a test was valid. From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes\nand does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Therefore, the match between Jerusalem and the shroud is a valid one. ”  \nEssentially then, although it is stated that aragonite is fairly common in Jerusalem, only one of the nine sites submitted by Nitowski matched the Shroud sample, that is from the Jerusalem tomb complex mentioned.  Nor is it enough to assert that aragonite is present in the Turonian strata of the Troyes caves or anywhere else.  Included with the Shroud and Jerusalem aragonite were the traces of strontium and iron, but no lead.  It seems that Sr can replace Ca in aragonite.  But the percentages should be able to act as location indicators.  More work would need to be done to quantify this aspect.\n\n","date":"March 31, 2015 at 8:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/27/ray-schneiders-five-part-eight-hour-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"presentation","title":"Ray Schneider’s Five Part Eight Hour Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Typo error in para 3 of mine above:\n‘It would seem then that the strata generally dip to the EAST, with the more recent deposits being in the east at this location.”\n\n","date":"March 31, 2015 at 8:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/27/ray-schneiders-five-part-eight-hour-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"presentation","title":"Ray Schneider’s Five Part Eight Hour Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It would seem that the concept of ultra-montane lies beyond the horizon range of an Italian world-view on matters pertaining to THEIR Shroud!\n\n","date":"December 21, 2014 at 1:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/21/shroud-exposition-youtube-channel/","cat":"2015","title":"Shroud Exposition YouTube Channel"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Even old fogies should rejoice in the presence of youthful enthusiasm, even it is ooffee-fueled.

To then make an induction as the blurb for the Gilroy Library blurb does, [“These results provided evidence that the Shroud of Turin was not the reported cloth that Jesus Christ was wrapped in after the crucifixion.”] is to ignore the controveries concerning the sampling, the evidence that the sample was not in fact truly representative of the cloth, and to go beyond the limits of valid scientific method. \nRogers himself is known to have initially accepted the results and was sceptical of the allegations made by Marino and Benford. True scientist that he was when he looked into the matter, he had to change his mind. To then claim that publication in his journal is tainted merely because he helped to found the journal, is to close the eyes to the evidence he presents. It is a minor matter compared to the gross failure of representative sampling. \nPam Moon has recently published three papers which can be found on the shroud-enigma web-site.

Whether or not the Shroud and the Mandylion were the one and the same object, it would seem presumptuous for every professional Byzantine scholar to assert that “There is no way that Image of Edessa can be the Shroud” when there are adequate indications that it might well be.  But perhaps that is the distinction between the present state of the disciplines of the humanities and sciences.  On the contrary, I know of only one particular tenuous indication of a possible early Frankish acquaintance with the Shroud image, the scourging illustration in the 8th century Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter, but that is easily explained by Byzantine-Carolingian contacts at the time.  Certainly no professional Gallic scholar has ever considered it worthwhile pursuing a first millenium journey of the Shroud from Jerusalem to France, a rather more tortuous journey than that to Byzantium.  Very likely, the reason is that no piece of evidence supporting a possible case has ever been discovered, whereas there are ample indications of its presence in Constantinople!  The Greek Orthodox epitaphioi dating from the 12th century and depicting a Shroud-like Christ laid out in death are merely one such indication.\n\n","date":"June 12, 2014 at 4:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/11/anticipating-the-conference-dan-scavone-on-evidence-of-the-shroud-in-edessa/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Dan Scavone on Evidence of the Shroud in Edessa"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Regarding brawls, I am acquainted with Hal Hellman’s series on “Great Feuds”, which include Mathematics, Technology, Science, and Medicine.

Jerome’s Latin Vulgate seems to use a fairly similar translation:\n“o insensati Galatae quis vos fascinavit ante quorum oculos Iesus Christus proscriptus est crucifixus”  Note the word oculos, translated direct from the Greek original ophthalmos.  The Jerusalem Bible English translation is not so direct, as its editors evidently believed they were closer to Paul’s meaning with the slightly more circumspect:\n“Are you people in Galatia mad? Has someone put a spell on you, in spite of the plain explanation you have had of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ?”  This JB translation has no sense of the possible use of a visual aid! And “before your eyes” becomes “plain explanation”. \nThe suggestion of Anatolian pollen on the TS has been known since before 1978, with Max Frei’s first set of samples.  If one accepts that the TS arrived in Constantinople at sometime, probably 10th century, then any overland route from the Middle East, whether Jerusalem, Antioch or Edessa has to pass through Anatolia, and this journey might suffice as an adequate explanation for the pollen.  For that matter, Constantinople is not so distant that pollen drift might be sufficient to account for the Anatolian dust. \nCorrespondents will recall the recent discussion on II Timothy 4:13-14 where Paul urges Timothy to recover the cloak left with Carpus at Troas.  This also provided grist for those who believed that Paul was toting the TS around as a visual aid for his mission.  An unusual Greek word was used which early translators interpreted as “cloak” whereas it might equally be interpreted as a type of carry-bag for the parchments that Timothy was to bring.  \nThere are some problems seeing Paul being permitted to use the burial cloths in this fashion.  The Jerusalem disciples had good reason for caution towards Paul, and it would have taken considerable time for them to trust him completely, even if they ever did attain this level of relationship.  Paul seems to have been at least partly hellenised, whereas the disciples seemed to retain much of their Jewish identity, perhaps not entirely convinced of the worth of Paul’s mission to gentile peoples.  This tension is reflected from time to time in various Pauline passages.  Custody of the burial cloths would most likely seem to rest  with Peter, and the obvious question has to be “Would Peter have sufficient confidence in Paul to entrust the cloths to him, particularly given the known hazardous nature of Paul’s journeys?” \nMarkwardt has suggested that at a much later date in the second century, Bishop Avercius Marcellus of Hieropolis was entrusted with the cloths from Antioch for the purpose of converting the household of Abgar VIII the Great of Edessa, before returning them to Antioch.  But the early church had reached a different stage of its development by then.  \nThe reading of the Acts and the Pauline letters convey the strong message that it was the quality of Paul’s preaching that won converts, and there are no hints there that the TS had any kind of role in this preaching.  It is a mistake I think to take one or two singular verses to prop up such a speculation, pollen notwithstanding.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2014 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/23/anticipating-the-conference-frederick-baltz-proposes-a-new-reference-to-the-shroud-of-turin-in-galatians/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Anticipating the Conference:  Frederick Baltz proposes a new reference to the Shroud of Turin in Galatians"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yes, I’m aware of it and a few others.

There is absolutely no trace of paint or dye or ink that can have formed the image; the cellulose of the linen was not involved in forming the image; the image is only present on the top-most crowns of the fibres;  any form of radiation could not have formed the image as it would have inevitably affected the fibres;  the coloration can be removed by the use of the solvent dimide which leaves the fibres underneath completely intact and unaffected;  Rogers firmly believed that the coloration lay in the sugar/starch coating of the fibres, and not the fibres themselves.  \nJoseph Accetta is asserting that all properties of the image can be explained by printing techniques available in the 14th century.  Unfortunately there are no clues in the Conference abstract of his paper as to what those printing techniques might be.  This must be a most mysterious printing process indeed, as according to Rogers it must exclude all dyes, paints and inks, or for that matter any organic compound containing any non-organic element, and it cannot involve any kind of radiation, and it must be confined to the surface coating of the fibres and not implicate the fibres themselves.  No doubt the conferees will be most curious to discover what this most mysterious printing process might be.  Of course Dr Rogers could be incorrect in a few of his assertions, but so far they all remain undisproved.

This was prior to the 1978 STURP project, and clearly well before the 1988 C-14 sampling was projected.  So the question of whether or not the samples were representative was not so much of an issue.  It was clearly a pilot investigation, not intended as a dating exercise.  It so happened that the the C-14 samples were eventually taken from the same area.  Raes was rather more fortunate with his samples, than were the others who among them received only individual threads, perhaps 16 or so, the longest being only 28 mm.  In addition to his two threads Raes was given two pieces, Piece 1 (main corner) 40mm x 13mm;  Piece 2 (side strip) 40mm x 10mm.  So he was fortunate indeed, and would hardly quarrel that they were not representative. \nIn commenting on Raes’ report, Ian Wilson notes:\n“But, as Raes observed, the size of the threads in Piece 2 certainly seems to be different from that of those in Piece 1.  He qualified this by saying that due to the very short length of the threads examined it would be impossible to be sure that they are from fabrics of different manufacture.  But the inference is undoubtedly there.  And it is strengthened by the fact that Raes was unable to find in Piece 2 any of the cotton traces of the main body of the cloth.” \nWilson had his own agenda in distinguishing the sources of the two pieces.  But setting that aside, It seems that it was sufficient for Raes to comment on. An alternative hypothesis to the two pieces being of different manufacture, is that one of the areas may have had repair work done to it.

This is not the impression that any of the gospel accounts that I know create for me, but rather there is more of a sense of immediacy.  It also seems to rely on the unproved assumption of an underlying “Galilean Aramaic sub-stratum”. The Greek texts that we have are those received into the canon by the early church fathers.  As far as I know, there is no or little evidence of much in the way of a prior text, Aramaic or otherwise, that would substantiate the assertion, but is only an inference made by a few exegetes who are certainly not unanimous in their opinions.  \nMy Greek does not extend to its case sensitive aspects, but my Latin certainly does, and Jerome’s Vulgate does not use the pluperfect, but rather the perfect and imperfect (continous) past tenses in describing the trial scene.  If you’re not aware of it already, a useful web-site for parallel texts, including five various Greek versions, Latin Vulgate, and assorted English translations can be found at:\nhttp://www.greeknewtestament.com/B41C014.htm\nI suspect however that you may not find that any of the five Greek versions there use the pluperfect, but would be intrigued to be advised otherwise.  \nI imagine that the Chief priests and others were plotting beforehand to see how they might pass the death sentence – the gospel acoounts certainly say as much – but I don’t see how this can be seen as any formal sentencing in absentia.  A gospel account records that the Chief Priest tore his robe at an alleged blasphemy. The exclamation “What need have we of witnesses now?” gives a sense of a present trial and interrogation of witnesses, and someone clearly saw this occur to record it. \nNevertheless, I do not think it necessary to go to these extreme lengths of argument to concede that John Mark may have been the trial recorder or not as the case might be.  I should think that the proceedings were likely conducted in either Aramaic or Hebrew, more likely Aramaic the native language of any prisoner brought to trial, and the record would be in that language.  It is equally likely that Mark wrote the gospel memoir from what Peter knew of it and various other oral accounts.\n\n","date":"March 4, 2013 at 9:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/the-face-jesus-left-us/","cat":"event","title":"The face Jesus left us"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, Thank you for your detailed exposition of your point of view.  I have enjoyed the challenge of this extended dialogue, even though we have not come to an agreed consensus.  Are you able to say that nowhere in the gospel of Mark is the pluperfect ever used?  In that case it would be a telling piece of evidence supporting your assertions – I may pursue this enquiry myself.  I take it that the translation entropy you mention is merely an inter-disciplinary borrowing of a technical term to account for the inevitable loss of meaning in all translations from one language to another.  Such entropy is only too evident in all forms of communication irrespective of translation, and regularly appears even in the normal exchanges on this web-site. \nIf Mark’s gospel was only intended for Roman Gentile Christians, why then was it not written in Latin?  Surely Peter in Rome would have access to a Latin-literate amenuensis.  The fact that it was written in Greek suggests that a more universal audience was intended.  Do you know of any other Greek literature written in Rome at this time? As far as I am aware any such tendency for Roman writers to write in Greek did not occur until after Hadrian.  \nI should think that the Peter-Mark collaboration would not occur in a vacuum of dialogue.  Any linguistic ambiguities arising from Peter’s Galilean background would surely have been sorted in their discussions.  Such considerations persuade me to prefer the conservative viewpoint of the majority of exegetes. \nYou may be interested to know that barbarism continues to be alive and well in southern Arabia.

Their crime revealed by confessions extorted under torture, is that as juveniles they were alleged to be part of a ring of jewellery store thieves.

Like many of the Jews there Paul inherited Roman citizenship, probably granted by the Romans as a reward for mercenary service in the previous century. This fact explains his two names. He used his Jewish name, Saul, within the Jewish community and his Roman surname, Paul, when speaking Greek. Though he had a strict Jewish upbringing, he also grew up with a good command of idiomatic Greek and the experience of a cosmopolitan city, which fitted him for his special vocation to bring the gospel to the Gentiles (non-Jews). At some stage he became an enthusiastic member of the Pharisees, a Jewish sect that promoted purity and fidelity to the Law of Moses. According to Acts, he received training as a rabbi in Jerusalem under Gamaliel I. His knowledge of the Law and of rabbinic methods of interpreting it is evident in his letters.”\nNot only did Tarsus have a Stoic academy, Paul knows enough Greek philosophy to draw on the Cretan Liar paradox.

It is not known who wrote the Letter, but Paul usually identifies himself as author in his own writings, and the theological emphasis in Hebrews is quite different from Paul’s usual style.  There is no shortage of potential candidates.  For all anyone knows, it may have been written by Apollos [Acts 18:24-28], an Alexandrian Jew, “an eloquent man with a sound knowledge of the scriptures”, “… helped the believers considerably by the energetic way he refuted the Jews in public and demonstrated from the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.”  Letter to Hebrews does much the same, but Apollos is only one of many possible conjectures. \nPaul’s towering intellect and cosmopolitan background is equally at home among both Jews and Gentiles, he would seem to have little need for a translator, the multilingual capabilities of such people of those times is easily under-rated, although it is evident that he often had recourse to an amanuensis when writing his epistles. \nI have less quarrel with Max than he imagines. We seem to be of a mind on the paper by Maryam Ebrahimpour et al; John Mark’s possible role as the High Priest’s servant, as the trial recorder, and provider of his temple garment as the burial cloth are quite credible speculations for a number of reasons, such as the possible healing of his wounded ear, if indeed it was Mark.

I consider that arguments from a recognised established authoritative sourced reference are to be preferred, and I believe more persuasive, than any unsubstantiated, uncited assertions, regardless of any claims to some expertise in such matters.\n\n","date":"March 3, 2013 at 5:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/the-face-jesus-left-us/","cat":"event","title":"The face Jesus left us"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The contributions that Dr Kearse has made to this web-site are outstanding, always a delight to read, with remarkable insights, clearly and scientifically expressed, generously sharing his all too rare expertise, but always with a professional prudence matched by the admirable Christian forbearance of his previous comment.

You correctly reminded me that John’s gospel identified the wounded servant as Malchus, not Mark. The error was mine.  \nTrial witnesses: Mark 14:53-56: “They led Jesus off to the high priest; and ALL THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS AND THE SCRIBES ASSEMBLED THERE. [Peter warms himself at fire] THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE WHOLE SANHEDRIN were looking for evidence against Jesus on which they might pass the death-sentence. SEVERAL indeed brought false evidence against him, but their evidence was conflicting. …” It is plain from Mark that there were rather more present than the three rostered members of the Sanhedrin.  As both Joseph and Nicodemus were both secret followers of Jesus, and would both have access to the proceedings, the case for their presence is not so weak as you state.  \nPapias: I am well aware of Papias claims, but Eusebius considered him an unreliable source: “Papias (died c. 130), a bishop of Hieropolis, in Asia Minor, was said by Irenaeus (died c. 200), a bishop of Lugdunum (now Lyon, France) to have been an eyewitness of the Apostle John. Papias had said, “For I did not suppose that the things from the books would aid me so much as the things from the living and continuing voice.” Eusebius (c. 260-c. 340), a church historian, reported these comments in his Ecclesiastical History and pointed out inconsistencies in Papias’ recollections, doubted his understanding, and called him “a man of exceedingly small intelligence.” ”  Papias’ claim that Mark wrote accurately Peter’s “memoirs” would refer to the gospel known as Mark, as “memoirs” was the word then commonly used to describe these scriptures.   \nMark may well have been Peter’s amunuensis in Rome, and it is supported by I Peter for what that is worth.  His possible role as official trial recorder is a credible conjecture, but I certainly can’t see it as an indisputable fact.  There were several other eye-witnesses to the trial, and I think it equally likely that their oral reports of the trial could just as well have been the source of the original gospel account.  We are too far removed in time for any kind of factual certainty, and credible conjectures cannot exclude other possible explanations.  \nI think I must adhere to the view that Paul would have been competent in at least koine Greek (Tarsus), Aramaic and classical Hebrew (under Gamaliel I), certainly without the need for a translator in his preaching, although he apparently found it convenient to dictate to an amenuensis for his epistles. I think it unlikely he was the author of Hebrews, but could concede it is just barely possible as Jewish recipients would require a different approach and Paul would certainly have adequate capability to have adjusted to this. But it is unlike other Pauline writings.\n\n","date":"March 4, 2013 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/the-face-jesus-left-us/","cat":"event","title":"The face Jesus left us"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Part of the problem is that history is no longer a core subject in our education systems, the focus being more on technology and indigenous cultures, rather than the inherited European traditions.

Few of our priests are younger than 70 years of age, and in Wellington archdiocese there are no current candidates for the priesthood. There will need to be major parish amalgamations, as has extensively happened in the Netherlands (at least two of our local priests are Dutch). We have to accomodate a mix of immigrant cultures, Filipino, Samoan, SE Asian, and include our own indigenous Maori and South Pacific cultures. It is more complex in the African and Asian countries. In the meantime, the gospel must be proclaimed, charitable works undertaken in the social option for the poor. All this creates its own religious focus different from the past.

I found this ignorance terrible.”\nI think you have to understand that there are very good reasons for this. Poland has of course remained an intensely Catholic country, even conservatively so, but this is not so much the case in Western Europe, except perhaps for the Latin Mediterranean. In the Anglophone countries, the situation is again quite different, where there has developed a strong Protestant tradition, stemming from intense persecutions during the Elizabethan age and subsequently. In England for example the anti-Catholic Penal Laws survived well into the 19th century. The era of nationalism also played a significant part in shaping these cultures and their religious allegiances. In Ireland, Catholicism survived, but the education constraints imposed by the English establishment meant I think that it was an intellectually impoverished Catholicism, but there were of course exceptions. \nIn the Anglophone countries it was inevitable that Protestantism had some impact on the Catholic outlook. Most of these countries, especially of the “New World” were remote from the religious conflicts of Old Europe, and the settlers were for the most part glad to have left them behind, more so their descendants. \nThe European interest in relics was often seen as a commercially  driven enterprise, heightened by stories of Tetzel’s provocative sale of indulgences, the underlying quest for “religious tourist attractions” and so on. It led to some scepticism in the value of relics as testament to religious history. Such stories as there being enough relics of the True Cross to build a navy flotilla of ships gained provenance. The religious expression in these countries became more focused on biblical events, with the Protestant emphasis on scriptural authority. \nIn both Australia and New Zealand the Catholic ethos was strongly influenced by traditional Irish pieties: the rosary, the Sacred Heart, and with our French Marist tradition, developments in Mariology. During my college days in the 1950s there was a strong focus, certainly in NZ, on the Fatima apparitions. My own parish church in Tawa, Wellington is dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima, along with about six other churches in NZ. Many NZ Catholics, and even some of my Protestant connections include a pilgrimage to Lourdes in their overseas tourist excursions. Other acquaintances, including our Wellington archbishop have walked the way of St James in northern Spain. \nIn 2003, I did discover in my local public library a copy of “The Quest For The True Cross” by Carsten Peter Thiede and Matthew D’Ancona. I found it an excellent and informative work and included a long review of the book in the church magazine I edit. There are small pockets of local interest in such matters, but they are rare. My own first real encounter with the Shroud was about 1960, when our University Dominican chaplain presented a slide-show at my Engineering School hostel. A few devout families, including my own, occasionally had depictions of the Shroud facial image in their homes. \nHowever, the suspicion surrounding the authenticity of alleged relics remains, and is not helped by the poverty of adequate evidence in most such cases, which fuel the doubts raised by sceptics. It is perhaps seen as a European preoccupation, while we carry on with our own local religious preoccupations, which are quite different, particularly with the multi-cultural immigration that has since occurred. The world is very much wider and more complex than Old Europe may perceive.\n\n","date":"June 10, 2013 at 5:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/07/the-shroud-of-turin-our-lady-of-guadalupe-tilma/","cat":"event","title":"The Shroud of Turin & Our Lady of Guadalupe Tilma"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I am fully aware of the Polish situation.

There is an excellent commentary on Gn 1 at the USCCB web-site which I think you might find extremely interesting.  \nThe older original creation story composed by the Jahwist source is actually chapter 2 where God is seen as more of an anthropomorphic being – he talks, walks in the garden, he searches for Adam who is hiding from him, he asks questions “Who told you that you were naked?’ and there is a talking snake. \nWhen the Jews were taken into exile, about 540 BC they were exposed to Babylonian science, and to the Babylonian cosmogony.  It was during this time that the Priestly source wrote the progressive story of creation we now read in chapter 1, but they still kept the older story.  The “us” in chapter 1 reflects the idea of God presiding over a heavenly realm of beings, and although some have argued an implicit trinity from it, that is too much of a stretch.  \nMaterial creation is bound by the Laws of nature, which as far as we now know includes the limits imposed by the speed of light.  Neither the Creator, nor spiritual creation is so bound.  They exist outside of Nature.  An example of this would be the reported miracles of bilocation, such as those said to have been enjoyed by Padre Pio, and other saints, as directed by God.  \nVerse 1 reflects the ancient understanding of the universe, earth below, a dome above, and a heavenly realm beyond.

For those not familiar with them, I can recommend checking out the link, which opens at an interviews on FAQs, including responses to some of Dan’s criticisms at the time. You can check out by other links the images there and some background overview on the method.  Briefly the idea as I understood it is that a picture is painted on a glass sheet (seems that oil paints were used), and the glass with cloth underneath is exposed to sunlight for several hours, forming an image on the cloth. It is argued that the relative motion of the sun eliminates traces of the brush strokes, and that controlled variations in brightness also give a 3-D effect. I saw no comment there concerning any pre-treatment of the cloth.\nAssuming this is not a leg-pull, and that the claims made are in fact kosher, then there are a few technical objections: 1) Could sheets of glass be made large enough? Wilson argues that with “cylindrical glass blowing” in the 11th century it would be feasible to do it with two separate sheets for the ventral and dorsal images;  2) Forgers seldom do one-offs, and no other attempts are known; But, such large sheets of glass would have been extremly expensive at the time; 3) The realism of the Shroud image fits into no medieval artistic category, and I think this might be the key objection; 4) The forger did not inform anyone else of the method; why would he want to produce a negative image? why are there no smaller, less expensive medieval examples of this process? \nHowever one additional thought did occur to me.

My recollection is that the fundamental difference is that Barbet is saying that the weight of the body is mainly suspended by the very high tension in the arms, which must in some way be taken by wrist bones to avoid tearng through the palms; whereas Zugibe claims that the bulk of the weight, maybe some 75%, can be taken by nail(s) through the feet. I don’t recall that Zugibe envisages the feet standing on a pedestal. \nBarbet’s version leads him to conclude that in order to maintain breathing, the crucifarius must therefore exercise some kind of see-saw motion constantly transferring his weight from his arms to his legs and back again.  He cannot maintain this action indefintely so that death is by asphyxiation.  \nZugibe does not see breathng as such a problem, as he claims that the weight being taken by the feet allows the crucifarius to breathe well enough.  So Zugibe is attributing death to shock. I don’t think it can be claimed that this is hair-splitting. \nI personally don’t find Zugibe’s scenario so plausible.

This was the work following his studies of Pia’s negative photos, under Yves Delage, which Delage presented to the Paris Academy, and which concentrated on the anatomical aspects. Its antagonistic reception by the Academy led Vignon to look into comparisons of the various icons.  These results were not published until 1938 under the imposing title ““Holy Shroud of Turin: Science, Archaeology, History, Iconography, Logic”; It seems to have been sufficient for the French Academy to have relented and they awarded Vignon their prize.  \nWilson lists the markings claimed by Vignon as: Vignon Markings: 1) streak across forehead; 2) open square between brows; 3) ‘V’ shape at bridge of nose; 4) second ‘V’ within 2; 5) raised right eye-brow; 6) & 7) accentuated left & right cheeks; 8) enlarged left nostril; 9) accented line between nose & lower lip; 10) heavy line under lower lip; 11) hairless area between lower lip & beard; 12) forked beard; 13) transverse line across throat; 14) heavily accented owlish eyes; 15) Two strands of hair at forehead.  \nThe markings have often been debated, and have been parodied on Davor Aslanonovski’s web-site for instance.  Nevertheless it is apparent that many claim to recognise these marks. \nRecognition of facial likenesses is a highly subjective matter, and artists will all have their own interpretation of what constitutes likeness. It may be salient that it is unlikely that any computer software would be successful in matching a variety of artistic likenesses of the same subject for instance. \nIt may be more relevant to rely on subjective perceptions of recognition of the likeness of icons to the Shroud face, than trying to develop a systematic method as Vignon apparently attempted to do.  I personally consider that many of the icons do in fact show a close likeness to the Shroud face.  But that is a subjective interpretation for which each of us is entitled.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2014 at 4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/26/how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Note that Paul Vignon published his main work on iconography in 1938.

The Renaissance men seem to have been more enlightened, having an adequate generalist background.  Not only did each have his particular gifts, but they were able to engage in an informed way on a large variety of topics. Today life is more complicated, and there is a tendency to specialise far too early in one’s career.  The ancient Greeks, no matter what their calling were all trained in geometry, an excellent disipline in critical thinking.  Euclid’s “Elements” survived some 2000 years, but modern educators thought they knew better and discarded it from the curriculum around the 1960s, in favour of post-modernist theories, which contribute little to intelligence. \nEven the last 500 years in the history of Science have any number of anecdotes of students with brilliant insights, at first rejected by their mentors and professors, often resulting in severe mental anguish for the innovator, but which later proved to be more enduring than the received wisdom.  The Galois’ mathematical theory of Groups is only one such example, but there are very many other instances.  \nThe aspiring academic, could do no better than once having been trained in his particular discipline, he should secure for himself a wider background and be prepared to study in much broader fields to fit himself for intelligent discourse.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2014 at 4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/26/how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Good work, O.K.\nIan Wilson included a very comprehensive display of examples of icons and copies of the mandylion in a slide-show for his paper he presented at the Valencia conference in 2012.

Firstly I think that there can be little question that the markings are present to varying degree on very many icons and on representations claimed to be based on the mandylion. Vignon and Wuenschel together deduced some 20 of them, Wilson has reduced them to 15. The second issue is what is the original source of these markings? Vignon was persuaded that it was the Shroud image, and Wilson echoes this.  Vignon apparently considered there were markings on the Shroud corresponding to the common elements that he had found on the icons. An explanation is needed as to why the various markings are repeated on so many of the icons.  Clearly there was some template on which they were based.  The various icons are generally claimed to be based on the image of Edessa, whatever that was.  Syriac monks dispersed copies of the image and it circulated around eastern christendom from about the sixth century following the emergence of the original in Edessa. \nHugh is setting himself up as a more authoritative observer than Vignon, Wuenschel and Wilson and is denying that he can perceive these markings on the Shroud image.  Whether he is justified in doing so might be argued.  Certainly other Byzantine art authorities have questioned the relevance of the markings and few of them seem willing to accept the significance of the markings. Why they do not consider them significant seems somewhat astonishing to myself, as they are readily apparent to me and to others and seem to demand explanation. \nThe third issue is whether after setting the markings aside, one can assert a subjective likeness exists between the iconic representations and the Shroud image.  In his last paragraph above, Hugh has gone as far as denying that even this is possible.  My own subjective interpretation is quite different, and I consider that there is a likeness.\n\n","date":"April 28, 2014 at 7:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/27/more-on-how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"More on How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh’s objections do not discover the reason why the various markings on iconography regularly occur. The likenesses also show on coinage, gold solidi of Justinian II of 692AD, and Constantine VII of 945AD, Homs vase 6th-7th century Louvre (Emesa, Syria). Constantine’s solidus appeared within a year after the mandylion’s arrival in Constantinople, and he was known to have closely inspected it on its arrival there. He describes it as ‘extremely faint, a moist secretion without pigment or painter’s art’; others saw it as blurred. This certainly matches the indistinct image of the Shroud cloth. That such a close similarity to the Shroud image appeared on his coinage is quite remarkable. \nWe do not know how the mandylion image was copied and conveyed to the various iconographic artists, whether there was one or more templates made from the original, or how a standard Christ-like portrait came to be.  There may have been only one or perhaps merely a few artists involved in making the templates from the original.  There was clearly scope for artistic interpretation in creating the templates from the original. It seems likely that only a few artists would have access to the original mandylion. However that such a standard form appeared with repetition of particular features seems clear enough and argues for a common origin. That at least some of these features can be found on the Shroud image, is at least reasonably suggestive that the common source was in fact the Shroud image, however remote from it, subsequent copies came to be.\n\n","date":"April 28, 2014 at 4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/27/more-on-how-valid-are-the-vignon-markings/","cat":"art","title":"More on How Valid are the Vignon Markings?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks to O.K. and also to Dan for the posting.

If you had, you would see that unlike some scientific fanatics I’ve come across, he’s not at all dogmatic about his conclusions that they were one and the same object but he weighs the evidence and gives his measured opinion on the matter.  As to the apparent clarity of the image, I imagine it may very well depend on the angle of the lighting.  In 944 AD, the Mandylion image was clear enough to the future emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, but his corrupt brothers Stephen & Constantine Lecapenus found the image very blurred.  Perhaps it requires a pure heart to see the truth of such matters.\nRegardless of the clarity of the Mandylion image, it nevertheless gave rise to countless icons as it was believed to be the true image of Christ not painted by human hands, all of them meticulously copying the Vignon markings, whether they made artistic sense or not.\nFrankly, I would like to see you lift your game by adopting a more scientific attitude, but that requires more of an open mind that you seem prepared to adopt,  For example you could use your chemistry skills to look more closely at such processes as outlined in Mouraviev’s paper: “The Image Formation Mechanism on the Shroud of Turin: A Solar Reflex Radiation Model (the Optical Aspect)”  It can be found at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/mouraviev.pdf.\nA closed mind is not uncommon among scientists, one writer makes a living from writing a series of books on the various feuds that have occurred, but it is hardly something to be admired, even though it may suggest loyalty to one’s convictions.\nErnst Mach was convinced that atoms did not exist as recently as 1895, with the result that Boltzman committed suicide because of Mach’s influence with the establishment.  A year or two later Einstein proved the existence of atoms from his Brownian movement experiments and calculations.  Nicolaus Steno, founder of modern geology, was so disenchanted with the bickering among his scientific colleagues, that he abandoned science, converted to Catholicism and entered the church.

I consider that O.K. makes a valid point that many of the Christ icons do show Vignon markings, and when they occur, they are consistently more frequent than such markings on non-Christ portraits.  It would not be uncommon for artists to imitate such features as Vignon markings in portraits of their other subjects.  Who can enter the mind of an artist?  Artistic styles often seem to follow a fashion. \nI have previously referred to Ian Wilson’s paper showing several slides of a wide range of Christ icons and representations said to be of the mandylion.  Ian Wilson – “Discovering more of Shroud’s Early history”, Valencia Conference 2012; Paper and slide show:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/wilsonvppt.pdf\nUnfortunately many of these examples have suffered the ravages of time and neglect, and are sometimes indistinct. \nBoth Vignon and Wuenschel together identified some 20 characteristic markings, and Wilson in his books reduced the number to 15. I would agree that we now need to move beyond Vignon. Clearly the basic idea was to identify those characteristics that were often repeated in the icons, particularly those that had some claim to be representations of the mandylion. But it should not be surprising if such characteristics may sometimes be repeated in other sacred non-Christ portraits, as imitating artistic style. \nThe time sequence and geographical dispersion of such characteristics would be important to detect any changing trend or development.  Whether this can be done on an objective basis may be awkward, as there would be often some reliance on variable subjective perceptions, as is already too evident in the recent discussions. \nThe project is essentially one that ought to rely on artistic expertise, and it seems unfortunate that few such experts have demonstrated much interest in committing themselves to such a project, but have been content to rely on the received wisdom of their skeptical predecessors. \nThere has to have been a discernible development in the representation of Christ icons, which can be analysed and stated in an authoritative way.  Perhaps it does need a multi-disciplinary approach as suggested by the initial correspondent. Like all such projects it requires time, interest, serious research, hard work and commitment, of the type that Paul Vignon was prepared to devote to it 80 years ago, before there was ever any concept of the internet and its advantages.\n\n","date":"May 14, 2014 at 6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Paul Vignon 1865-1943: biologist, worked with agnostic Anatomy Prof Yves Delage, prepared anatomy paper based on Pia’s photography, presented to Paris Academy by Delage 1902; Published “The Shroud of Christ” 1902;  Paper hailed by British Medical Journal “The Lancet” and by Paris “Figaro”  Paris Academy dominated by agnostics and “free-thinkers”; Academy Secretary refuses to publish paper;  Delage writes to Secretary expressing his disgust, turns his attention to other interests,  Vignon suffers nervous disposition as a result of Academy’s rebuff.

And yet Robert de Clari’s sighting of a Christ-imaged cloth in the church at Blachernae in 1204 seem unequivocal, and there are several earlier Byzantine references to such a cloth, a himation, the cloth that God wore, and so on.  Our Shroud next emerges some 150 years afterwards in the French village of Lirey in 1355, apparently the property of Geoffrey de Charney, reported by his descendants to be a reward for services rendered and freely given, and hence not acquired through thievery or conquest.  \n1)  The recent enquiries by Mario Latendresse demonstrate that there appears to be no known family tradition connecting Othon de la Roche with the Shroud and that the casket in the Castle Ray-sur-Saone purported to be its reliquary seems only to have been recently labelled as such.  \nThere are also other serious problems with the Othon theory.  In 1204, Othon as a medieval lord owed fealty to his own lord and military commander, Boniface de Montferrat, both owing fealty to the recently elected emperor Baldwin IX of Flanders.  If the Theodore Angelos letter to Pope Innocent III happens to be genuine, and if Othon did indeed possess the Shroud, then this would have been known in 1205.  Baldwin was captured and likely killed by the Bulgarians in April 1205, and Boniface survived until September 1207.  \nIt would seem inconceivable that either Baldwin or Boniface would have knowingly deferred to Othon’s possession of such a highly prized relic.  If they were unaware of Othon’s seizing of the Shroud, then he effectively stole it from those to whom he owed sworn fealty.  It would seem unlikely that Othon would have deceived his liege lords in this way, and if he had, then it is also unlikely that they did not learn of it, and reclaim it from him by force if necessary. \n2)  No shroud was ever inventoried among the relics placed by King St Louis in his new Sainte Chapelle.  We read of a “Du sainte suaire” = ‘a piece of the holy shroud’, and “une sainte face” = ‘a holy face’.  Later inventories refer to the latter as a ‘a holy towel in a frame’, seemingly the mandylion of Edessa.  If the mandylion was ever the Shroud, then it had been unfolded long ago in Constantinople, according to those advocating this hypothesis.  The holy towel in a frame continued to be inventoried until at least 1575 when the actual Shroud was already on its way from Chambery to Turin.  \n3)  The mainstay of Ian Wilson’s Templar hypothesis for their secluding the Shroud during its missing years, seems to be the alleged worship of an idol in the form of a head from confessions obtained under torture.  He also refers to a painting of a Shroud-like Christ found in the 1940s on a ceiling panel of oak boards found at Templescombe, possibly dating to about 1300.  \nDaniel Scavone has noted that no two Templars ever gave the same description of the alleged idol, none ever described it as a cloth image, some said it was a skull, yet others said it had three heads.  He also notes that some of these Templars were menials, and not part of the inner circle present at the secret meetings when the idol was supposedly exposed.      \nMore significantly, he notes that the inquisitors used the same questions in the trials of the Cathars, and that it would seem that the inquisitors themselves intruded the idol into the interrogations, and the members of the Order described one in the hope of leniency. \n4)  We turn next to certain heretical dualistic sects in southern Europe as possible Shroud repositors.  They seemed to have their origins in a type of Neo-Manichaeism imported from the Paulician sect of Armenia and Asia Minor.   The Bogomils flourished in the Balkans between the 10th and 15th centuries, fusing Paulician dualism with a certain Slavonic movement aimed at reform.  During the 11th and 12th centuries it spread over many European and Asian provinces of the Byzatine empire.     \nThey considered that the visible material world was created by the devil and rejected the doctrines of the Incarnation, Baptism, the Eucharist and the whole organisation of the Orthodox Church.  By the early 13th century the dualistic communities of Southern Europe comprising the Paulicians and Bogomils in the East and the Cathari in the West, formed a network stretching from the Black Sea to the Atlantic.  \nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, Rome dispatched several legations and Franciscan missionaries to convert or expel Bosnian heretics.  With the Ottoman conquest of South-east Europe in the 15th centuries, obscurity descended upon the Bogomil sect. \n5)  The Cathari in southern France and northern Italy, emerged in France during the 12th and 13th centuries.  They professed a neo-Manichean dualism, reinforced by western dualists returning from the Second Crusade, and also by visiting Bogomil bishops.  By 1140 they were an organised church with a hierarchy, liturgy and a system of doctrine.  They became well-established in the general Pyrenees area particularly in the kingdom of Leon, which incidentally provides a link with Oviedo its former capital.  They became known as the Albigensians.  \nLike the Bogomils, they preached that Christ had only been a ghost who only appeared human, and denied his incarnation, death and resurrection, and also the eucharist, transubstantiation and the mass.  \nIn 1218 the Cathari were confronted in the city of Leon by a Catholic prelate, Lucas of Tuy.  Having personally destroyed one of their chapels, he wrote De Altera Vita, detailing various Cathari tenets and religious practices, displaying his own pathological hatred of heretics and Jews.  \nIf De Altera Vita is to be believed, then there was evidently a wide disparity between Cathari beliefs and their practices.  For Lucas claims that the Cathari had manufactured a most unusual crucifix, departing in many ways from traditional orthodox depictions.  Essentially this was a ‘crux simplex’ comprising an upright stipes with no cross-beam, an inscription plate and a foot-rest.  The figure of Christ was portrayed attached by only three nails, with one driven through his crossed feet, and the heretics claimed that Christ was pierced in his left side by a Roman lance.  Evidently his arms were extended directly above his head attached to the stipes.  \nGiven their strong aversion to images, the Cathari ought not to have produced such an object, and yet Lucas asserts that in fact they did.  Furthermore, in doing so and given the strong tradition of the form of the crucifix, they ought to have followed some of these traditions, but they did not.  Also given their rejection of the Eucharist, they ought not to have invited the leader of the Albigensian Crusade, Amaury de Montfort, to see the body of Christ that had become flesh and blood in the hands of their priest.  \nA syndonic solution may resolve this paradox, the disparity between Cathari belief and their practices as alleged by Lucas.  Uninformed by modern medical science, and failing to perceive that the Shroud was a mirror reversal, they judged that Christ’s arms were extended vertically above his head, and that the chest wound was on his left side.  Indeed Barbet was later to propose that the feet were crossed and fastened by a single nail, as Lucas asserts of his Cathari crucifix.  A Eucharist solution is not possible to explain the invitation to Montfort, but a bloodied Shroud image might serve as an adequate explanation.\nGiven Cathari aversion to images, it is curious that inquisitors were to charge them with worshipping an idol in the form of a head, as later inquisitors also charged the Templars. \n6)  The disappearance of the Christ-imaged cloth as reported by Robert de Clari in the chaos of the Crusader sacking of Constantinople in 1204, might then be explained by a Bogomil seizure of the relic and its transference through their extensive Neo-Manichean network to the Cathari in Languedoc.  \nPope Innocent III had attempted to put down the Cathari heresy but this ended in disaster in 1208 with the murder of the papal legate.  Amaury de Montfort had led the Albigensian Crusade in 1214-1224 ravaging Toulouse and Provence.  A more orderly persecution sanctioned by King St Louis IX of France was more successful, with the capture and destruction of the castle at Montsegur, the Cathar stronghold in  1244.  During the siege, four Cathari were said to have scaled down the steep cliffs taking with them a treasure of unknown content. \nThere would then seem to be two possible routes by which the Shroud might have come into the hands of Geoffrey de Charnay.  \nThe first of these is that following the capture of the Montsegur castle, the Shroud came into the hands of King Louis IX.  Not being part of the Contantinople relic booty, it failed to be catalogued with these relics.  However it would then seem peculiar that it does not seem to be otherwise recorded in any other known inventory.  Eventually it would be bestowed upon Geoffrey de Charnay for services rendered as claimed by his descendants. \nThe second possible route might seem more credible.  It would postulate that following the 1244 siege, the Shroud still remained hidden somewhere in the south of France.  In the Spring of 1349, Charny’s royal annuity was modified to include the first forfeitures that might occur in the Languedoc senechaussees of Toulouse, Beaucaire, and Carcassonne.  If the Shroud were then discovered during these forfeitures, it would rightfully become the property of Geoffrey de Charney in accordance with this grant.   \n7)  There are several defects and anomalies in the various attempts to date at explaining the sojourn of the Shroud between Constantinople in 1204 and its arrival at Lirey in 1355: a) it does not seem to have been catalogued with the collection of the Louis IX Sainte Chapelle relic collection from Constantinople; b) nor could it have been subsumed there under the identity of a holy face nor as a Shroud fragment; c) it is an open question as to whether the Shroud was ever in Besancon; d) the Othon de la Roche story with its Castle Ray storage no longer seems viable;  e) there also seems no adequate basis to support Ian Wilson’s Templar hypothesis. \nThe victors’ customary practice of destruction of the conquereds’ records and documents always creates problems for any historian.  Given the various defects and anomalies, the Cathari route for the Shroud is no less credible than most other attempts at a solution, and might even stand up to better scrutiny.  It may in fact be its actual route. \nI am indebted to Jack Markwardt for some of the information in this posted comment, both through personal communication and also his papers:  “Was the Shroud in Languedoc During the Missing Years?”, 1997, and “The Cathar Crucifix: New Evidence Of The Shroud’s Missing History”, 2000.\n\n","date":"December 5, 2015 at 6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/01/a-must-read-regarding-the-othon-de-la-roche-hypothesis/","cat":"history","title":"A Must Read Regarding the Othon de la Roche Hypothesis"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Mario for your response.

Similarly when Robert Burns asserts that the Shroud is a fake, that doesn’t make the Shroud a fake either.\nIt has to be shown to be a fake by some kind of weight of evidence process, and so far that hasn’t been done.  Neither has it yet to be shown to be authentic beyond all shadow of doubt whatsoever, but that’s probably not possible of any artifact.  But there is a reasonable amount of evidence that shows that the Shroud is probably authentic, as indicated in Dan’s heading at the top of this blog site.\nIt might perhaps best be illustrated by means of an electric circuit analogy.  If the steps in logic are connected in series, and one of the steps break down, then that part of the circuit completely fails and that part of the logical process fails.  However if the various components in the deductive process are connected in parallel, then it needs every component in the circuit to fail, before the whole logical process fails.\nThis gives the lie to the XYX mantra invoked on this site at various times.  If X, Y and Z are connected in parallel, then it requires all of X, Y and Z to fail before the logic breaks down, but that hasn’t happened.  If X breaks down, and Y and Z remain secure, then the circuit still works, and similarly if both X and Y break down but Z remains secure, then the logic is still there.\nX will break down, if only one of its series elements, X1, X2,  … Xn breaks down.  So that’s my lesson in how to arrive at a logical conclusion.  I hope that it is sufficiently clear that all may understand it.  And who knows?  We might have us all thinking logically for a welcome change.\nIncidentally, even Aristotle knew that the earth was round, simply by observing the earth’s shadow during any lunar eclipse.

The very many diverse examples given by Guscin suggest that owners of the several copies may have been anxious to establish a veneer of authenticity for their own particular copy, and to associate it with the Image of Edessa, but possibly reluctant to admit that theirs was only a copy.  Note that in a somewhat similar fashion, several ancient churches had claimed to have been founded by one of the apostles to bolster their claims of apostolic origin.   \nGuscin makes a passing observation concerning the Image of Camuliana, by noting that one particular case he refers to may have been the Camuliana.  In 540 AD Persian Chosroes attacked and destroyed Antioch, and then set his sights on Edessa.  An imaged cloth, not made by human hands, was subsequently discovered in Camuliania and a group of orthodox priests paraded it around Anatolia in 554.  In 574 Justin II brought it to Constantinople, and it became known as the Image of God Incarnate.  Markwardt claims that this is the object which was actually the true Shroud, and which accounts for those stories relating a full body image. \nGuscin who was closely associated with Ian Wilson in their visit to Sanliurfa (Edessa) during their investigations does not seem to make a distinction between the face-only image of the Mandylion, and the various stories relating a full-body image, but seems prepared to allow that they may have been one and the same.  He skirts around the problem of specifically associating stories of the full-body image with the Turin Shroud by claiming that this is beyond the limits of his thesis.  Clearly the Camuliana was not the Mandylion, as they are two distinct objects, their arrival in Constantinople being separated by some 400 years. \nOver the next few days, I hope to make a closer study of Guscin’s wide-ranging paper, and may then be able to comment on it in more detail.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2015 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/a-superbly-detailed-exploration-of-the-image-of-edessa/","cat":"history","title":"A superbly detailed exploration of the Image of Edessa"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I wish John luck in his enterprise, but he will never succeed in persuading our resident liberal Catholic in Quebec.

In YC’s final paragraph above, he refers: “It is almost impossible to reproduce in a lab all the environmental and biological conditions that prevailed at the time of Jesus burial and so, it will most probably be impossible for anyone now or in the future to fully reproduce the body image on a linen cloth with all the same chemical and physical characteristics than we see on the Shroud of Turin.” \nBut perhaps it is precisely in the specific conditions of the burial and conditions of the tomb, the 30 hours during which the body was wrapped enabling the image to optimise, the various other conditions, the fact that it only ever happened in the case of Jesus the Saviour of the world, and no-one else, wherein the nature of miracle might be found.  Even the Jospice mattress was an imperfect and unsatisfactory image, but in the case of Jesus, the conditions were apparently just right.  Why was it just right, in this unique specific case?  That is surely where the miracle can be found.

It began to flourish in Palestine in the 1st century AD and had as its main concern ecstatic and mystical contemplation of the divine throne, or “chariot” (merkava), seen in a vision by Ezekiel, the prophet (Ezekiel 1). The earliest known Jewish text on magic and cosmology, Sefer Yetzira (“Book of Creation”), appeared sometime between the 3rd and the 6th century. It explained creation as a process involving the 10 divine numbers (sefirot; see sefira) of God the Creator and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Taken together, they were said to constitute the “32 paths of secret wisdom.”\nHowever the actual text of the “Last Supper Papyrus” as quoted above, seems to provide no evidence for its use as any kind of magic talisman, but is NT orthodox.

There must be a reason why the edge piece was sewn on, and the provision of a finished selvedge makes reasonable sense.  Of course, Wilson also has another explanation, that it was a deliberate intention to centralise the facial image to conceal the cloth’s true identity as a burial cloth so as to produce a Mandylion type of presentation.

So therefore these are not merely idle speculations withour supporting arguments, and it is these arguments that need to be addressed. \nYannick claims that Wilson was only able to agree to only one of the folds identified by Jackson.

A Reply to Professor Averill Cameron” identified in an earlier posting on this site.  What Wilson actually said was this:- \n“… Jackson … has claimed the pinpointing of at least four of the hypothesised ‘doubled-in-four’ foldmarks, with another two reasonably certain, and the two remaining there by implication.  Particularly notable is one foldmark studied by Jackson, at postion C according to his notation, which can be traced clearly in all photos, including Xray and ultra-violet, and even the comparitively primitive ones taken in 1898.  Since this crease-line occurs precisely one eighth length from the Shroud’s natural half-way fold line, in itself it strongly suggests that the Shroud was once folded in the very way I have hypothesised for it to have been the Image of Edessa.” \nIn other words, Wilson’s comments on one particular fold are making an emphatic point, that this particular fold can be traced clearly in all photos, and that it occurs one eighth of the length from the natural half-way foldline; NOT as Yannick asserts that it is the only fold that is clearly distinguishable!

Robert de Clari had described how the cloth had appeared to rise every Friday, and the Jackson demonstration of this was an attempt to search for an explanation of the otherwise mystifying four closely spaced folds that he had also discovered, and why some of the frontal folds seemed to be no longer visible.   \nLet viewers judge for themselves as to whether the other folds are present or not, They don’t need to be told what they can see.

Such inferences he makes as “overwhelming evidence that the Shroud is 14th century” and his opening salvo with the discredited D’Arcis memorandum hardly signals an objective intent.  Not one single flake of the paint which he alleges originated the image survives nor has ever been reported in any single historical document.  On the other hand we have ancient documents that report that the image was perceived as “not made by human hands”.   Byzantine epitaphioi, notably the Stavronitska, some dating from the early 12th century, would seem to be persuasively derived from the Shroud image, and the Shroud therefore can hardly be 14th century.  Mr Freeman blithely dismisses in his obviously agenda driven hypothesis any such argument and carefully selects only that which supports his tenuous case. \nWhat are we to make of the scientific credentials of one who is still prepared to firmly assert that no AB type blood appeared in the human species before 1000 AD and was the result of the Magyar admixture of A and B types from the Mongol incursions of that time when it is known that there are significant populations of AB scattered throughout the world, particularly in the Far East and Middle East, and AB is even found among certain non-human anthropoids.   \nMr Freeman glosses over why any artisan should choose to make a mirror image of the Christ with its chest wound appearing on the left hand side of the body, when all liturgical traditions have the wound on the right side of the body, as it happens to be forensically correct to drain the right side of the heart of its blood, a mortal blow known to the Roman soldiery.  The left hand side is what we see as the result of a type of contact imprint, and any competent artisan would have seen to it in the design of his template by reversing it.  The image has been carefully studied by several forensic pathologists, none of whom entertained any doubt that the image was of a genuine crucified human male, and was no artifact.  \nWe expect that any art historian worthy of the name ought to be able to categorise a work of art, assign to it the particular prevalent style, comment on the genre, place it within the context of other like works, identify the methods used, if he cannot identify the artist to place it within a certain school of art, and compare it to other like works.  This Mr Freeman is unable to do, not because its contemporary companions no longer exist, but because they never existed at any time at all!  Any artisan who might have constructed such a work, only ever did it once, he left no record of how he did it, nor is there any trace of his failed attempts, and no-one else ever thought to record the event either.  \nAs Mr Schwortz implies, it is the Science which authenticates the Shroud as the burial cloth of the Christ, and it cannot be dismissed by the agenda driven hypothesis of any misguided   art historian.\n\n","date":"October 29, 2014 at 3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/29/barrie-schwortz-dismisses-freemans-claims-it-was-the-science/","cat":"history","title":"Barrie Schwortz Dismisses Freeman’s Claims: It was the Science"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Readers of this blog shoud check out the document: “CHAPTER I.

It is almost as if the disciples wanted to keep it a secret, and this might even suggest that the image became visible on it very early and so was concealed.  \nConcerning the burial:  All three synoptics say that Joseph takes Jesus down, wraps him in a SINDON, and lays him in a tomb hewn out of rock.  It is John who says that Joseph and Nicodemus bind the body with OTHONIA along with spices according to the Jewish burial custom, with a garden close by, and lay him in a new tomb there.  \nConcerning the resurrection:  In Matthew & Mark, the women enter the tomb, see one young man clothed in a white robe, they are amazed, Jesus is not there, no mention of seeing the burial cloths.  In Luke the women see two men in dazzling garments, Jesus is not there and they report to the apostles;  Peter then runs to the tomb, sees the OTHONIA and goes home amazed (Luke doesn’t then mention the SINDON that he has said was used to wrap the body).\nIn John, there is a different but more elaborate story.  After Mary of Magdala has seen the stone rolled away, she reports to Peter and to another disciple ( = John?) that “they(?) have taken the body, and she doesn’t know where”.  Peter goes into the tomb and sees the OTHONIA (John hasn’t mentioned a SINDON) and the SOUDARION that covered the head is rolled up separately.  John? goes in, sees and believes (What did he see to make him believe?)  They both go home.  Meanwhile, continues John, Mary stays outside tomb weeping, bends down and sees two angels in white, one at the head and one at the foot where the body had been.  (De Wesselow asserts that this seems to be a reference to the Shroud image.)  She says “they’ve taken him, don’t know where”, she turns, sees the gardener, “Sir, where have you put him?” and then recognises that it is Jesus.  \nMax Patrick Hamon has suggested that Mary’s mistaking Jesus for the gardener may have been because gardeners commonly wore a himation, a shroud-like garment.  If Jesus was wearing the Shroud as a himation, this goes against De Wesselow’s hypothesis about the two angels being the ventral and dorsal images on the Shroud. \nThere are various apocryphal stories concerning what happened to the burial cloth, the Gospel to the Hebrews being as early as the second century.  One story is that it was given to Pilate’s wife, another that it was given to St Luke who passed it on to Peter, and another source says that it was kept by Peter.  Adrie vd Hoeven has written a comprehensive paper that it was originally John Mark’s temple garment, picked up by the arresting guards at Gethsemane, given to Pilate, and recovered from him by Joseph for the burial.  Later liturgical sources associated the eucharistic altar cloths with the burial cloths, whence the term “corporal ( = corpus)”.   \nIt is all something of yet another enigma concerning the Shroud.  However if the images had formed at a very early stage, then it is not surprising that the disciples wanted it to be kept secret.  One of Paul’s authentic epistles suggests that he might have used it as a visual aid for some of his missionary work, although on the face of it this would seem unlikely.\n\n","date":"November 11, 2014 at 4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/jesus-walked-off-with-his-shroud/","cat":"biblical_evidence","title":"Jesus walked off with his shroud?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, I quite frequently have recourse to the very long article (some 24 separate chapters) on Biblical Literature from the Encyclopedia Britannica, which, although not the most cutting-edge research, has the advantage of some reputation as recognisable proven scholarship, even though some details will always be disputed.  It has an excellent chapter on the derivation of the canon.  I’ll copy it as an extract and send it to you.  I think you might find it quite informative.   \nA few extracts here:\n“The first clear witness to a catalog of authoritative New Testament writings is found in the so-called Muratorian Canon, a crude and uncultured Latin 8th-century manuscript translated from a Greek list written in Rome c. 170-180, named for its modern discoverer and publisher Lodovica Antonio Muratori (1672-1750). Though the first lines are lost, Luke is referred to as “the third book of the Gospel,” and the canon thus contains [Matthew, Mark] Luke, John, Acts, 13 Pauline letters, Jude, two letters of John, and Revelation. ”\n… …\n“Some principles for determining the criteria of canonicity begin to be apparent: apostolicity, true doctrine (regula fidei), and widespread geographical usage. Such principles are indicated by Muratori’s argument that the Pauline Letters are canonical and universal-the Word of God for the whole church-although they are addressed to specific churches, on the analogy of the letters to the seven churches in Revelation; in a prophetic statement to the whole church, seven specific churches are addressed, then the specific letters of Paul can be read for all. ”\n… …\n“The criteria of true doctrine, usage, and apostolicity all taken together must be satisfied, then, in order that a book be judged canonical. Thus, even though the Shepherd of Hermas, the First Letter of Clement, and the Didache may have been widely used and contain true doctrines, they were not canonical because they were not apostolic nor connected to the apostolic age, or they were local writings without support in many areas.” \nThus it was not only the matter of heretical movements such as Gnosticism, that disqualified various writings, but other criteria also had to be satisfied for a book to be considered canonical.  Conversely, there are clearly some writings that can be considered reliable, even though they may not be canonical.  Of course I would not place the Gnostic writings in this category.\n\n","date":"November 11, 2014 at 7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/jesus-walked-off-with-his-shroud/","cat":"biblical_evidence","title":"Jesus walked off with his shroud?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"To clublu2:  I believe we both may have assisted in one such recently [Clue – Ch 18],  But my email to you bounced, I guess your filter was set just a little too high for me.

It would therefore seem to be adopting a literalist perspective of the Bible, which to me is a mistaken undertanding of the Bible’s true intent. It leads to such fruitless projects as the various searches for Noah’s Ark on Mt Ararat, which is a failure to understand the true purpose of the story. \nThere is not even agreement as to what books constitute the “Bible”. This was evident as early as the Samaritan separation from the rest of Judaism (~722BCE). The Samaritans only acknowledge the Torah, the first five books alleged to be given by Moses, and do not acknowledge the prophetic books which only seem to have been compiled around the time of the Babylonian captivity in the 6th century BCE, or afterwards.  Deprived of their temple worship, the Jews in Babylon sought to assert their special identity by recalling their ancient stories and writing them down. Many of these stories were incorporated into the already existing proto-Genesis and proto-Exodus books. Their exposure to Babylonian science also had an influence. The story of Creation in Gensis ch.2 is a very ancient anthromorphic story and was retained, but the more elevated Creation story in Gen ch.1 is a product of their time in Babylon, and was placed first. Likewise they took the flood myths of the Babylonians and reinterpreted it in greater depth to yield the story of Noah. \nThe early Christians had as their scriptures the Greek Bible compiled in Alexandria over a considerable period after 300BCE, and it is frequently quoted in the New Testament. It includes the deutero-canonical or apocrophyl books, including much of the wisdom literature. Its use by the early Christians led to a Jewish reaction in the Council of Jamnia which declared the additional books to be non-canonical, and they reverted to the Hebrew Bible. Despite their acceptance by Jerome and their continued inclusion in the Catholic canon, the Protestant reformers adopted the same position held at Jamnia and also excluded them. The Catholic Council of Trent reacted by declaring the disputed books to be canonical, and reasserted this position at the First Vatican Coucil of 1870. \nWhen we come to the New Testament, the inclusion of some of the books were also matters of occasional dispute. By about 200CE, the criteria for canonicity had generally been settled as: apostolicity, true doctrine, and general usage. All three criteria had to be satisfied. Thus although the Shepherd of Hermas, the First Letter of Clement and the Didache were all accepted as containining true doctrine and in general use, they did not satisfy the criterion of apostolicity. Nevertheless the Letter to the Hebrews, with its non-forgiveness of apostasy, was only reluctantly accepted in the West, and Revelations is still considered dubious by the Eastern churches. Martin Luther was reluctant to accept the Epistle of James but eventually acquiesced into accepting it. \nProbably as a reaction against the Protestant reformers emphasis on scripture as the sole arbiter on matters of true doctrine, the Catholic position towards scripture seems to have been to subordinate it somewhat. It possibly saw scripture as the product of a living Church, and the Church was to be seen as the sole arbiter of its intent and interpretation. The encyclical Providentissimus Deus of Pope Leo XIII in 1893 was a turning point against any such trend, with its establishment of the Pontifical Institute of Biblical Studies. Further impetus and encouragement for the faithfuls’ study of the Bible came with the encyclical Divina afflante Spiritu of Pope Pius XII in 1943. The topic of Revelation was at first contentiously debated at the Second Vatican Council, some 60% of the Council fathers being quite dissatisfied with the preliminary drafts. However the final document Verbum Dei, Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation came to be considered the second most important document promulgated by the Council, only after Lumen Gentium, the Dogmatic Consitution of the Church. \nAlthough the Catholic Church seems to have come belatedly to the serious study of the scriptural sources, particularly when compared to the 19th century Protestant scholars, it would be fair comment to say that it has now very likely surpassed present Protestant scholarship in the study of the scriptures.  \nTo see the Bible as proclaiming history or as an arbiter of science, is to demean its purpose. Its content is filtered by the times and understanding and the perceptions of those who first inscribed its text over the course of many centuries. I see its purpose as proclaiming the dealings of God with humanity, and of humanity with God. Yes, it contains an understanding of history and an understanding of science, but it also contains codes, aphorisms of wisdom and proverbs, liturgy, poetry, parable in its many forms, apocalyptic writings, and even a wedding song. In the New Testament, the intent is to proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord, Saviour and Redeemer.\n\n","date":"August 1, 2013 at 9:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/01/bible-archeology-the-mystery-continues/","cat":"history","title":"Bible Archeology: The mystery continues"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Wiki has more detailed information, including a translation of the inscription.

Initially Byzantine objections to a naked Christ even depicted icons of the Crucifixion with Christ wearing a full length tunic, despite the gospel accounts of his “being stripped of his garments”.  The paper mentions the Homs vase showing a Shroud-like Christ and the Justinian II coin of 692.  Used as labara, the images rather than showing a suffering Christ, more often displayed a triumphant Christ. but with Shroud-like features. \nIf portraits of Christ or else the True Cross displayed in battle as labara resulted in victories, this was taken as divine approval of the practice, whereas defeats were interpreted as divine disapproval and usually initiated bouts of iconoclasm.    \nFrom p.41, Markwardt begins a section on the ‘Road to Iconoclasm’.  The Justinian II solidus illustrated above was issued in 692.  He awaited God’s verdict on this use of the image for imperial purposes, which was not long in coming.  “In 695, Justinian was deposed, and his enemies, aware of a Byzantine tradition requiring an emperor to remain unblemished, cut off his nose before sending him into exile. A decade later, Justinian would return at the head of a foreign army, capture Constantinople, and reclaim his throne; however, apparently convinced that his use of the Image of God Incarnate had incurred God’s wrath, he employed only non-Pantocrator images of Jesus on coinage minted during his second reign.”  Hence we have the later solidus shown at the head of this posting, essentially a non-Pantocrator type image.   \nOn p.48, he commences a new section ‘The Imperial Covenant with God’.  From about the year 740 a series of destructive earthquakes struck Constantinople, and they were interpreted as a sign of divine disapproval for the displaying of a cloth with the divine image as discussed in the Tarragon manuscript, and it was kept locked up in a golden case.  “From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake.”  This cannot refer to the Mandylion which only arrived in the city about 940, and clearly some other relic is meant.  The only complying image at that time was the ‘Image of God Incarnate’.  From that time on the earthquakes ceased, and the Image was consigned to four and a half centuries of obscurity.  Note that following its arrival in the city ~940, the Mandylion continued to be shown to western royal visitors and others.  \nFrom p.67, Markwardt describes how the imperial covenant was eventually broken at the turn of the 13th century under the emperor Alexios III Angelos, who from his general behaviour seems to have had little respect for any possible threats of divine wrath.  Hence we have Nicolas Mesarites’ of 1201, “that Jesus’ resurrection was being reenacted in Pharos Chapel ceremonials which involved a sindon that had “…wrapped the mysterious, naked dead body after the Passion” “.\n\n","date":"July 10, 2015 at 4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/10/byzantine-coins-again/","cat":"history","title":"Byzantine Coins Again"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Note that the epitaphioi depicting a a frontal more or less naked Christ, usually with crossed hands over the pelvis and with scourge marks and other wounds, that were commonly used in the Easter liturgies, begin to date from the early 1200s, signifying that the full Shroud image had by then become widely known, since Alexios III had allowed the ‘Image of God Incarnate’ to be taken out of its casket after some 460 years of concealment.\n\n","date":"July 10, 2015 at 11:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/10/byzantine-coins-again/","cat":"history","title":"Byzantine Coins Again"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Problem 1:  The Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter scourging scene dates from 800-814, and might be linked to Charlemange’ sojourn in Constantinople.

The son and the grand-daughter of Geoffroy de Charny also stated clearly that the Shroud was from Geoffroy de Charny, not from Jeanne de Vergy.”  \nThere are still several possible explanations which might not exclude the Othon – Jeanne de Vergy chain.  Under French matrimonial property law of the time, it might be thought that any property brought to the marriage was legally the husband’s.  Humbert was the second husband of Margaret de Charnay, the grand-daughter of Geoffrey I.  As the Shroud had come into her possession from her father Geoffrey II, and she herself goes under the de Charnay name, it is not unreasonable that it should be stored in a reliquary bearing her father’s coat of arms, rather than her grandmother’s.  Despite the Shroud coming direct to Margaret de Charnay from her father, it is Humbert her husband who assumes the role of agent in the matter dealing with the Lirey canons, whether or not it was presumptuous of him to do so.  The Shroud may have come from Othon down to Jeanne de Vergy, surrendered to King Louis as were other Byzantine relics, and the king may then have thought it meet to return it to Geoffrey I de Charnay in recognition of his services, which would explain the statements given by his offspring.  If Othon had taken the Shroud from Byzantium, there may have been a family cover-up to protect Othon’s name, in view of such illicit actions, which had been condemned by the Pope.    \nI should be interested to know more from Eugene Ray as to his family’s traditions in this matter, if he feels free to express them here.\n\n","date":"May 30, 2015 at 4:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/29/challenging-the-othon-de-la-roche-story/","cat":"history","title":"Challenging the Othon de la Roche Story"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think what is important here is not so much that Eugene asserts various claims for connecting the Shroud with Othon de la Roche and the Le Ray castle, but that the claims made are true in fact.

I think there is a good argument that it might well have been 1355.  On 1356, May 28, Bishop Henri of Troyes goes on record as praising Geoffrey I de Charnay for founding the Lirey church.  On Sept 19, that same year 1356, Geoffrey I was killed at the Battle of Poitiers.  The Lirey badge commemorating the first ostentation shows the De Charnay arms on the dexter side and the De Vergy arms on the sinister, which according to the ordinary conventions of heraldry would imply that Geoffrey was still alive at the time when the badge was struck, i.e. before Sept 19, 1356.  Writing in 1389, Pierre D’Arcy alludes to the first showing as some 34 years previously, implying a date sometime in 1355.  That is as close as D’Arcy can claim, even though he ought to have had access to Bishop Henri’s Troyes diocesan records giving a more specific date.  The figure 34 years, is clearly taken to the nearest whole year, not just the nearest 5 years or thereabouts.  Considering the significance of the badge, a first showing in 1357 seems unlikely, and if one presumes Geoffrey’s presence at the actual showings, and his likely absence from Lirey while preparing for the Poitiers campaign, then even 1356 might seem doubtful.  The year 1355 is more consistent with the D’Arcy allegations, even though it would pre-date Bishop Henri’s praising of Geoffrey, and over-ride any objections Henri might have had to the ostentation.\n\n","date":"May 29, 2015 at 6:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/29/challenging-the-othon-de-la-roche-story/","cat":"history","title":"Challenging the Othon de la Roche Story"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh Farey and I frequently have different opinions on the question of authenticity, on what constitutes evidence, and the interpretation of that evidence, and sometimes either one of us aggravates the other.

The only reason for depicting the Vignon markings are that many of them can only be found on the Shroud, as a result of the injuries iniflicted by the Roman soldiery.\nIf the Mandylion was a separate object, then it would need to have been made during the Way of the Cross to have shown the same markings, rather like the Veronica legend.\nAnother factor is the cultural abhorrence of displaying a burial cloth, which seems to me a sound reason of why the early Jewish church fails to mention it, and why they were probably relieved to send it off to a good Gentile home where it would be more appreciated, than they were capable of doing.

The search for a solution to the puzzle means a quest into the unknown;  Lines of enquiry open up possibilities; sometimes there appear to be promising leads, but then end up as a dead end.  The researcher has an investment in his work, it becomes his baby, and he defends it against all onslaughts.  The more enigmatic the puzzle, the longer time that a solution delays its emergence.  Meantime the various theories thrive, no matter how outlandish they may appear to be.  Difficulties of access to the object of research also creates problems of discovering the solution.\n\n","date":"August 16, 2014 at 4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/comment-promoted-looking-beyond-an-edessa-constantinople-route/","cat":"history","title":"Comment Promoted:  Looking Beyond an Edessa-Constantinople Route"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Gabriel, I’d like more confirmation before coming to your conclusion.

In this particular case, the face is presented on a landscape framed aspect, (a classic Mandylion presenation) and it is held by a cherub-like figure, not by St Veronica.

He refers to such complicated weaves as the Rameses girdle, but which would not require the same large size of loom as required to weave the Shroud.  He has previously been reluctant to admit the possibility of a Middle East provenance of the Shroud because linen threads are Z twist, whereas most known surviving cloths from there are S twist, although I gather this is particular to Egyptian cloth.  Perhaps it is conceivable that other Middle East linen cloth was made as Z twist.  \nA search for comparable control samples for the 1988 C-14 testing was apparently fruitless, and I believe that the only control samples that could be found were only of plain weave.  Apparently no other surviving linen specimen of 3 to 1 herringbone could be found for purpose of a control sample. \nHe expresses frustration at researchers’ unwillingness to look outside the Edessa-Constantinople route, and I think the point can be taken that perhaps the Shroud or Mandylion would not have survived long walled up in the damp climate of Edessa, which was prone to flooding.  \nResearchers have seen similarities between the Shroud image and the multitude of icons said to have been based on the Mandylion or the Image of Edessa, and this would seem to be a principal reason why the Edessa route has persisted in Shroud lore.  Certainly there was such an object as the Mandylion held at Edessa and taken to Constantinople.  Of that there can be no question.  Nevertheless there is a strong argument that there has to be some kind of connection between the Shroud image and the Mandylion image, whatever its origin.  \nI make no secret of my belief that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Christ, and bears his image.  But I cannot suppose that Jesus was in the habit of regularly wiping his face with towels or veils and dropping his image on to them, as various legendary accounts would have it.  It is not Jewish, it may even have been considered offensive, and it is certainly not scriptural.  I believe there is only one time that it ever occurred, and that was in the tomb, however that may have been caused.  Multiplying the occasions when it happened, are clearly derivative, and are merely pious attempts to explain the otherwise inexplicable of the one single proto-image.  Alternatively they are attempts to sanctify clearly derivative objects, such as icons. \nI have previously mentioned Markwardt’s theory that the Shroud was taken to Antioch and kept there.  It makes a lot of sense to me, more than taking it to Alexandria as Charles would seem to have it.  We know that Peter was first bishop of Antioch, and there is good indicative evidence that he held the burial cloths.  Markwardt suggests that the hiding of the Shroud in a wall in Antioch for safe-keeping when other relics were being pillaged or destroyed there, may be the true basis of the similar story from Edessa,  Antioch, although often prone to earthquakes, and on the Orontes, could more likely have had a more conducive climate for the cloth’s survival in a wall than Edessa.  He suggests that it was taken to Edessa only when Antioch was under threat from the Persian Chosroes.  Arriving in Edessa, it was of course not stored in a wall but in the Hagia Sophia cathedral there. \nAccounts of stories often get garbled in the retelling, and there are always local agendas which like wonders to be self-referential.  Perhaps scribes have too limited an attention span to tell the full story of what they may hear.  The truth of what actually happened is usually rather more complicated than the stories which emerge as the establishment tradition.  This would be one reason why I believe Markwardt’s theory the more credible.\n\n","date":"August 15, 2014 at 8:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/15/comment-promoted-looking-beyond-an-edessa-constantinople-route/","cat":"history","title":"Comment Promoted:  Looking Beyond an Edessa-Constantinople Route"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Based on the initial posting, I had made a false presumption at #6 that this object was different from the Charny medal evidently struck by Geoffry de Charny & Jeanne de Vergy to commemorate the Lirey showings of the Shroud.

However Gazay claims the Calvary dates from 1304 (his interpretation of the Romanized date inscription), and it can be clearly seen that in this depiction, the sculpture has been given a type of classic Mandylion presentation, facial image only, and landscape aspect within a solid frame, not what we would have expected if the sculptor had modeled it from what he might have seen from viewing the Shroud.  This could argue that at this time the Shroud and what was thought to be the Mandylion, or a depiction of it, were in fact two separate objects. \nIn his paper, Gazay has clearly brought into the Shroud and Mandylion being the one and the same object, but I don’t see that his argument necessarily follows.  \nBy blowing up Gazay’s photograph of the Calvary to 400%, I can persuade myself that the forehead may bear an epsilon mark as shown on a Shroud positive photo (not the 3 as per negative).  Beyond 400%, there is too much graininess to discern it.  \nIf the Calvary is meant to be a depiction of the Mandylion, this would argue that the original of the Mandylion was in fact modelled at a very early time on the Shroud facial image.  There are too many other correspondences between the Shroud facial image and the various iconic representations of Christ, to deny that the Shroud served at some time as the primal source of these various depictions, quite regardless of the controversy as to whether the Mandylion and Shroud were or were not the same object.  The debate is irrelevant to this issue.  \nAs indicated in Dan’s posting, a higher standard of photography showing a clearer picture of the forehead is required to settle as to whether the epsilon is present or not.\n\n","date":"February 22, 2013 at 5:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/22/david-rolfe-we-need-you/","cat":"history","title":"David Rolfe we need you"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis’ concilatory approach towards the current high priest of Byzantine art history is to be applauded.  However I find myself unable to share his faith and confidence that this discipline will at present be able to “contribute with constructive criticism” and shed some light on the history of Shroud of Turin, which I think is a great pity.  One would prefer to think that potentially it might be able to, as indeed several other disparate disciplines have contributed positive understandings of this relic.  However there are few or even no signs that it can do so at present.  \nDavor has categorised me as an adolescent sexagenarian, (which flatters my actual age), and has taken a solemn vow to ignore any of my subsequent postings.  Other readers of this blog may judge for themselves whether his appelation is accurate or not.  However I should like to hope that of such is the kingdom of heaven.  I too can indulge in wishful thinking.  At least I do not seek to be boring. \nHis primary thesis is to create out of his imagination, and from his ivory tower cocoon, two categories, that of the exoheretic and endoheretic.  His purpose in doing so seems to be create a protective mantle from the great mass of the unwashed for his own specialised discipline.  He identifies himself as a “pompous and arrogant git”, which might very well be true, but this pathetic attempt at “false modesty” is in fact an inverted “ad hominem” argument, and simply won’t do.  \nI think there is much for thought in his observation: “We, Christians, have once FORGOTTEN that there was a cloth, in some niche above some city gate, that bore Christ’s BLOOD.”  There are of course many reasons for why this might have occurred: vigorous persecutions in the early Church; recurring bouts of iconoclasm; the known acquisitiveness of Byzantine emperors, even Constantine himself, and the obvious need for secrecy in preserving such a sacred relic from beng converted into the emperor’s pyjamas.  It is little surprise that much has indeed been forgotten.  The greater population of Europe for instance seems to have forgotten most of its Christian heritage, and this fault extends even to my own tiny country.     \nHowever when we consider other disciplines, particularly in the hard sciences, major contributions have been made in our understanding of the Shroud.  Medical forensics: Yves Delage, Paul Vignon, Pierre Barbet, David Willis have all contributed positive evidence.  In Botany, even the primitive work of Max Frei identified pollen samples exclusive to the Dead Sea area, Palestine, Turkey, Greece, as well as the more ubiquitous Mediterranean species, and subsequent investigators have confirmed these findings.  Textile specialists have affirmed contamination from cotton exclusive to the Middle East, that the linen has been manufactured in accordance with known ancient Syrian practices, that the cloth itself is exactly 8 x 2 Royal Syrian cubits, while other investigators such as Nitowski, believed that there is pursuasive evidence of Jerusalem aragonite limestone comtamination.  In Chemistry one needs only mention the comprehensive studies carried out by Ray Rogers.  Photography and modern space imaging technology have contributed to our understanding of the image. \nTo all of this, Aslanovski and his brethren turn a blind eye.  The best he himself can come up with is that there may or may have not been a first century burial cloth with an image of Christ crucified on it, or it may be a medieval scorch mark!  This only emphasises the cloud cocoon of a singular disciplinary approach which grants little credit to other more scientific disciplines than the received wisdom of Byzantine art theology and its divine revelations.      \nThere is a single vacuum in our understanding of the Shroud, that is, its provenance and its history.  Various investigators have attempted to fill this void in their own particular way.  This has not satisfied the “true experts” who have abdicated from their responsibility in seeeking out an alternative that might satisfy.  They have shown that they have nothing to offer.  Nevertheless, the hard sciences have demonstrated that the authenticity of the Shroud is a credible proposition.  To this, the Byzantine Art Historians say: “Sorry, we have nothing to offer!” \nPerhaps it does not matter that there is this void.  The Shroud is here and now, for our own particular technological age to understand and make of it what we will.  Perhaps it is indeed a love letter from Jesus, meant for our own time, a witness aganst a disbelieving age.  \nDavor Aslanovski, may as he is so vowed to ignore my posting.

Nor does the DA blog deal adequately with the description of the cloth as ‘tetradiplon’, that it was a much larger cloth than was apparently visible in its normal display form – its presentation in landscape aspect.fits no normal artistic convention for such an object.  Following earthquake damage to Edessa’s churches in 679 AD when the cloth was temporarily removed to Jerusalem, a French bishop Arculf reports seeing a ‘trial by fire’ on the sudarium at Jerusalem,  The cloth is evidently about 8 feet long, but possibly doubled over. \nA major argument that the Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object, has to be the appearance of the Vignon markings on so many of the icons and coins from about 692 AD onwards.  These markings, visibly only on the Shroud, were slavishly copied even when they made no other artistic sense.  Any attempt to refute Wilson’s theory has to deal with this question, but the topic is not addressed at all. \nOn the cloth’s first arrival in Constantinople in 944 AD, the emperor’s sons had difficulty discerning the image, and this seems to fit in with the faintness of the image visible on the Shroud.  One further aspect is that the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople was marked by a general rejoicing, the institution of a major feast day observed annually throughout Orthodox Christianity, but no corresponding feast day for the arrival of the Shroud, a much more notable relic, which only seems to have become slowly manifest in Constantinople over a period of time, very likely when the Mandylion was removed from its framework.  However the Byzantines were not about to give up on their precious Abgar legends, the stories which had become woven into their liturgies, and so the myth of the Mandylion as a separate object persisted.\n\n","date":"June 23, 2012 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/23/davor-aslanovski-on-the-edessa-image-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Davor Aslanovski on the Edessa Image and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I note Dr Aslanovski’s sustained and prolonged attack against my personal character on his blog.

They are too complex to summarise easily here. About half the book comprises citations, notes and references. Nevertheless he is sparing in his acceptance of apocryphal source. \nFor deciding what comes from Jesus as distinct from early Christian tradition he proposes five primary criteria:\n– 1. The criterion of embarrassment: Why invent what would invite difficulty for the early church?\n– 2. The criterion of discontinuity: Why reject as words or deeds of Jesus what cannot be derived from the Judaism of Jesus’ time or the early church?\n– 3. The criterion of multiple attestation: Is it more plausible to deny words, sayings, or deeds attributed to Jesus in more than one independent literary source (e.g., Mark, Q, Paul, and John) or literary genre (e.g., parable, miracle story, or prophecy)?\n– 4. The criterion of coherence: Given the claims to historicity from any of the above criteria, are different sayings or deeds evidently inconsistent?\n– 5. The criterion of rejection and execution: If Jesus’ ministry came to a violent, public end, what of Jesus’ words or deeds could have alienated people, especially powerful people?\nThe criteria are to be used in tandem for mutual correction. Still, any claim is only to the probable, not the certain. \nI concur that the earliest assertion as to Mary’s perpetual viginity is the James Protevangelium ~145AD, but it was not accepted as doctrine until very much later. It is also the source that asserts that Jesus’ siblings were from a previous marriage of Joseph. Meier rejects this on the basis that the Greek word used for sibling is “adelphos” rather than “anepsios”, implying a direct full sibling relationship. The James source is first mentioned by Origen in the early 3rd c. “which was of recent and dubious appearance”, sharing some common ground with the “Gospel of Peter”. It also asserts certain Jewish practices for which there is no other evidence. As I previously mentioned, I believe that adoption would be a credible alternative, would admit the term “adelphos”, and it would reflect the generous spirit of Mary and Joseph. \nNote that at Matthew 1:20, the Angel tells Joseph not to be afraid to take Mary his wife into his home. I see that as potentially undermining the traditionally accepted doctrine. i.e. Joseph may take Mary as his wife. \nFurther comment on the distinctions between the individual gospels: When does Jesus become God? For Mark, it is when the Holy Spirit descends on him at his baptism by John in the Jordan; For Matthew and Luke it is at his conception; But for John, it is from the beginning, before time ever was. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God (distinct?) and the Word was God (identical?)” The mystery  of the Trinity already!\n\n","date":"December 27, 2013 at 4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/25/did-jesus-talk-funny-and-when-was-he-born/","cat":"history","title":"Did Jesus Talk Funny and When Was He Born?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Nevertheless, I believe I obtained some very valuable insights from Crossan’s “Power of Parable”, which I had not found elsewhere.

For a good historical perspective, I can only recommend John P Meier’s “A Marginal Jew”, specifically Vol 1, and also Pope Benedict XVI, “Jesus of Nazareth”. Meier sets a stringent discipline for himself, specifying some five criteria in his selection of facts he is prepared to accept. He concludes that Jesus was born about 7-6 BC, most probably in Nazareth, rather than Bethlehem, was baptised by John in 28, and accepts John’s version that he died on Preparation Day, making the year either 30 or 33AD.  He opts for Friday, April 7, 30AD, at age about 36 years old.  \nThe Last Supper is to be seen as a farewell meal, rather than a Passover meal, although there are some calendrical variations that might allow it to be a Passover meal. In John’s scenario, the crucifixion occurs while the Paschal lambs are being ritually slaughtered at the Temple, making the timing particularly poignant. \nMeier considers that the brothers and sisters mentioned in Mark’s gospel are blood-siblings rather than opting for other patristic explanations, the perpetual virginity of Mary being a late doctrine of the 4th century. I believe that adoption might offer an alternative explanation, as adoption was a widespread practice in those times, because of high mortality rates resulting in many orphans, and adoption conferred the same rights as birth under both Jewish and Roman law. \nWe need to keep in mind that the gospels were not intended to represent history in the style of Josephus, notwithstanding that the gospels draw on actual historic events. Each one of the evangelists has his own agenda, with the intention of proclaiming Jesus variously as Messiah, the Son of Man (c.f. Daniel), and Lord. Raw Mark tends to tell the crude bare facts as he sees them, Matthew sees Jesus as the new Moses and is writing for a Syriac congregation, seeking to bring in Gentile elements, Luke has his own agenda and is most obviously anti-Jewish, while John is more elevated, identifying Jesus as the timeless Son of God, and totally in control of his destiny. \nAll of the evangelists have a most remarkable familiarity with the ancient scriptures which they use to an astonishing degree to bolster their message. \nI repeat, each of the evangelists has a specific agenda of proclaiming, and the message is more important than the literal text. Remember too, that Jesus was following a strong tradition of conveying his message in parables, and much of what we read in the gospels is itself intended as parable. Perhaps this is the best and only way of communicating deep and profound truths of great significance.\n\n","date":"December 26, 2013 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/25/did-jesus-talk-funny-and-when-was-he-born/","cat":"history","title":"Did Jesus Talk Funny and When Was He Born?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"David Mo: “It is highly unlikely that the apostles or any other saved the shroud.”\nThe arguments mentioned by DM have been extensively discussed in any number of papers, many of which appear on the shroud.com site, and present an entirely different perspective. \nFor starters, I suggest a reading of “LAZARUS & JESUS” by Albert Dreisbach, presented at the Atlanta conference 2005. It can be found at:\nhttp://shroudstory.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dallasdreisbach.pdf\nOther writers including Jack Markwardt believe the Shroud was first taken to Antioch by the Apostles, most likely St Peter.

The principle was, in fact, invoked before Ockham by Durand de Saint-Pourçain, a French Dominican theologian and philosopher of dubious orthodoxy, who used it to explain that abstraction is the apprehension of some real entity, such as an Aristotelian cognitive species, an active intellect, or a disposition, all of which he spurned as unnecessary. Durandus is primarily known for his opposition to the ideas of St Thomas Aquinas. \nDurandus’ attack on the teachings of Aquinas came at a time when Aquinas already was accepted as the official theological doctor of the Dominican order. Durandus taught that a philosopher should prefer the conclusions of his own reason to any authority except in articles of faith; the acceptance of truths of faith, on the other hand, did not depend on reason at all. This separation of reason and faith undermined the position of Scholastic philosophy generally, because much of it represented an attempt to bolster articles of faith by speculative reasoning.\nHowever as recently as Pope Benedict’s visit to the UK for the canonisation of John Henry Newman, he made it clear that both “Faith and Reason” were necessary, and condemned Faith without Reason as leading to fanaticism. What price Okham’s razor now?  [Source for Durandus’ ideas – Encyc Brit article]  \nIn science, Nicole d’Oresme, a 14th-century French physicist, invoked the law of economy, as did Galileo later, in defending the simplest hypothesis of the heavens. Other later scientists stated similar simplifying laws and principles.  However in his search for simplicity, Galileo refused to accept Kepler’s discovery that the planets and other celestial bodies actually moved in ellipses rather than circles, his preferred Platonic and Ptolemaic idealistic approach which Galileo wished to retain. Newton’s discovery of the inverse square law of gravitation, following on from Kepler’s work, confirmed that the centripetal gravitation caused by large bodies, resulted in orbits of the various conic sections.

The present time is clearly inappropriate. With few exceptions, anyone involved in the testing and sampling does not come out of it at all well.  Poor decisions were made throughout, and each seem to have had their own agenda.  With this experience, it is only too plain that the objectivity of a proper scientific approach was abandoned, and it suggests that personal egos had too significant a role.  The Shroud needs to be approached with a humility that is only too rare in the present climate, and that certainly seems to apply to the present scientific climate, if the 1988 experience is any indication. \nAnyone wishing to comment on any scientific testing of the Shroud should first read the 30 page paper “The setting for the radiocarbon dating of the Shroud” by Emanuela Marinelli, Valencia, April 2012.  http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf  \nSample extracts:\n[synopsis] “The method of radiocarbon dating, performed in 1988, placed the origin of the Shroud between 1260 and 1390 A.D.; but the reconstruction of the events that led to that analysis, and the controversy following its course, throw heavy shadows on the validity of the result. Not all the procedures followed for the completion of the radiocarbon test were regular. The history of the events and of the traumas suffered by the relic make it a difficult object, whose radiocarbon dating cannot provide reliable data. The analyzed sample, because of its peculiar characteristics, was not representative of the whole sheet. Consequently, according to the radiocarbon dating it cannot be definitely stated that the manufacture of the Shroud should be placed in the middle of the fourteenth century.” \n[Comments by Gove] ” … who emphasized seven points of difference from the original protocol of 1986: 1. The laboratories are reduced from seven to three. This eliminates the possibility of detecting a mistake made in the measurement by one or more of the three laboratories. Such mistakes are not unusual. 2. The use of the two dating methods has\nbeen reduced to one. 3. The amount of cloth that each laboratory will receive has been\ndoubled. With this further material other laboratories could be included. 4. Representatives of the laboratories will not be allowed to observe the sampling. 5. The samples will not be\nunravelled, and thus that of the Shroud will be more easily identifiable. 6. The Pontifical\nAcademy of Sciences was unaccountably excluded. 7. The acknowledged textile expert\nselected to remove the sample was replaced by an unnamed person.”\n[Gove continues] “… All these unnecessary and unexplained changes unilaterally dictated by the Archbishop of Turin will produce an age for the Turin Shroud which will be vastly less credible than that which could have been obtained if the original Turin Workshop protocol had been followed.

Adherence to the Wilson theory still seems to be maintained by Daniel Scavone, and now more recently it seems by Mario Latendresse.  \nJack Markwardt had some years ago proposed that the burial cloths were taken to Antioch by St Peter, and had been kept there.  He had proposed that Bishop Avercius had been given temporary custody around ~200 AD, that he had used it as some kind of visual aid for the conversion of the court of Abgar VIII at the king’s request, that this had led to the compilation of the tale of the Doctrine of Addai as an allegory by implicating his predecessor Abgar V Ukkama to conceal the conversion from the imperial court, and also the composition of the contemporary Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl, and that Avercius had then returned the Shroud to Antioch.   Until recently, it had also been Markwardt’s belief that when Persian King Chosroes besieged Antioch in 544 AD, the recently discovered Shroud was then taken to Edessa, and he had accepted the Wilson hypothesis of it becoming the Mandylion.  \nMarkwardt has since radically revised this scenario by abandoning the Wilson hypothesis and asserting that Bishop Ephraimius took the Shroud to the safety of Cappadocia in Anatolia.  Ephraimius died in 545 before he could recover the Shroud but only some nine years later a group of orthodox priests was parading an Image of Christ around Anatolia and it was the very first image to be called “acheiropoeitos”.  He considers that this image was in fact the Shroud.  It was soon taken to Constantinople and was variously referred to as the Image of Camuliana or the Image of God Incarnate. \nMarkwardt presented his latest paper at a two hour special session at the St Louis conference in October 2014.  “MODERN SCHOLARSHIP AND THE HISTORY OF THE TURIN SHROUD”  http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf  \nHe provides very detailed arguments as to why the Mandylion theory should be rejected, as there seem to be too many inconsistencies with it, and he cites several historical authorities supporting such rejection.  Pages 5 to 15 are dedicated to an evaluation of the Mandylion theory and give the objections which its proponents must deal with and answer before advancing their cause further.  Apparently there was an exchange at the St Louis conference with Daniel Scavone who is one of the very few academic historians still prepared to accept it.  Whether or not Scavone will eventually come around to a similar point of view as the majority of other academicians interested in the problem, time will tell. \nThe whereabouts of the Shroud during its obscure years of 1204 to 1355 remain enigmatic, and of course various hypotheses have been proposed.  Back in 2000, when Markwardt had been still prepared to accept the Mandylion theory, he had proposed that the unique Cathar crucifix with its Shroud-like features suggested that the Albigensians in southern France, specifically Languedoc, had come into possession of it through contact with their Balkan coreligionists the Bogomil heretical sect.  It was during this time that there was a general dramatic shift in the representations of crucifixes.  \nPope Innocent III had declared a crusade against the Albigensians, which threw the north of France against the south, destroying the Provencal civilisation, culminating in the Treaty of Paris 1229, and destroying the power of the southern princes, but not in exterminating the heresy.  Many fled to Italy and their hierarchy faded out in the 1270s.  It lingered on through the 14th century and finally disappeared in the 15th.  If the Albigensians had the Shroud, then it was surely taken by the French crown and eventually awarded to the Charnay family “for services rendered” as later given out. \nThis is only one of several hypotheses for the location of the Shroud during this period, but absent the Mandylion theory, and it may well be as true as any other such hypothesis.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2015 at 10:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Extract from website, St Catherine’s Pantocrator: \nThe exceptionally high quality of the painted icon suggests that it must have been the product of a Constantinopolitan atelier in Justinian’s age.

It also seems that the Homs Vase Christ impression apparently from the sixth century might well predate both the coin and the icon.  The coin image in my view, together with the Homs, has more of a Shroud likeness than even the Pantocrator.

His paper is available on Barrie’s shroud.com site.  It comprises a marvelous slide show with possibly the most comprehensive collection of representations of the Mandylion available.  It also happens to include a number of 16th & 17th century painted copies of the Shroud.  Wilson thereby demonstrates that artists painting direct from the Shroud believed that the eyes were open, and this would dispose of any objection that the Mandylion eyes were always shown as open.  Certainly it would seem that the artists have not attempted to represent the herring bone weave on their copies of the Shroud, they merely painted their perception of the Shroud image on the particular cloth they used, in most cases probably just a plain weave. \nWhen we come to his collection of depictions of the Mandylion, all of which are clearly intended as deliberate art works according to the various contemporary styles, not one of them seemed to make any attempt whatsoever at representing the distinctive weave of the Shroud cloth.  \n“Discovering more of the Shroud’s Early History”, Ian Wilson, Valencia 2012:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/wilsonvppt.pdf  \nThere are in particular two striking Shroud-like facial images of Jesus dating from about the 7th century.  The first of these is on a hammered silver vase, found among church ruins in the Syrian city of Homs, formerly Emesa, a late 6th century centre of Byzantine Christianity, this vase now being in the Louvre.   The second Shroud-like facial image is on a coin issued by Justinian II in 692, featuring a non-suffering Pantocrator-type image of Jesus with wide peering eyes, forked beard and uneven hair lengths.  In 695, Justinian was deposed, his enemies cutting off his nose and sending him into exile.  Upon his victorious return to Constantinople at the head of a foreign army some 10 years later, he apparently interpreted his earlier defeat on issuing coins in the Image of God Incarnate as a mark of divine disapproval, and henceforth the images of Christ on his coins displayed only non-Pantocrator type images.  \nIt would therefore seem that a Shroud-like image of Christ was known in Constantinople as early as 692, some 250 years before the Mandylion arrived there from Edessa, but very soon after the arrival of the acheiropoetios Image from Anatolia.      \nDoubtless as an acknowledged art historian, De Wesselow was probably able to make his own particular contributions, but in many respects he seems mainly to be echoing Wilson.  The objections to the Mandylion theory, such as those summarised in Markwardt’s paper, need to be dealt with by those advocating the theory.  I very much doubt that De Wesselow was able to do this or attempted to do so.\n\n","date":"August 5, 2015 at 6:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick, my sincere thanks for the link to the Grierson paper on Byzantine coinage.  I shall find it invaluable as a general resource.  However I note that Grierson considers that the image of Christ on the 692 Justinian II solidus derives ultimately from the bust of the Phidian Zeus.  His reference to the Pantocrator is a much later version in the dome of a cathedral ~1100 than that of St Catherine’s monastery.  Possibly he considers that the Pantocrator is also based on the Zeus.  I rather suspect that the historians are quite reluctant to recognise the possibility of the Shroud’s image being known at this time, and consequently are unlikely to attribute it as a source for iconic or numismatic imagery.       \nSt Catherine’s monastery was founded at the direction of Justinian I (527-565).  The St C. Pantocrator had been previously believed to have been 13th c. until the newer paint had been removed, and is now assigned to the 6th – 7th century.  Whether it was sponsored by Justinian I or Justinian II therefore seems to me uncertain.  \nWhether the Pantocrator was based on the Phidian Zeus or a known facial image of the Shroud might be debatable.  To me the image of the 692 AD solidus looks much more like the Shroud image than it does to the Pantocrator.  The features on the solidus seem to me to reflect the bruised distorted face of the Shroud than the triumphal aspect of Pantocrator. \nHowever the Homs vase Christ image would seem to be much earlier.  I read (possibly from Markwardt) that Emesa was a thriving Byzantine Christian centre in the 6th century.  On looking into references on Emesa, I discover that it was notably Christian even in the 4th century.  So possibly the Homs vase might even be as early as this.  The images on the vase and the 692 solidus are quite similar.\n\n","date":"August 7, 2015 at 4:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, Reading through Markwardt’s full paper, including the various extracts in the footnotes, one might easily form the impression that Lucas of Tuy was something of a pathological case.

The story behind the Mandylion is based on the Abgar legend, which was modified several times in the course of history.  It requires some skill to unravel the various threads and modifications.  The story is first mentioned in the 4th century Ecclesiastical History by Eusebius of Caesarea who discovered it in the archives of Edessa, which by then had become a major centre of Syriac Christian scholarship.  Briefly, Eusebius describes it as an exchange of letters between Jesus and Abgar V Ukkama, but makes no mention of a towel bearing an image of Jesus.  Eusebius did not like icons and so it is possible his omission may have been deliberate, or else it was not part of the original story.  \nThe story itself is quite improbable if interpreted literally, however there must have been some reason for composing the story and entering it into the archives.  The most likely explanation seems to be that it was composed as an allegory to conceal a secret, and that secret was the conversion of the court of King Abgar VIII the Great around 200 AD.  The reason for keeping it secret was that the tolerant emperor Commodus had been deposed and was succeeded by a despotic emperor Septimus Severus and persecution of Christianity had resumed.  Abgar VIII had previously displeased Rome, had been sent into exile, but had recently been reinstated.  He would not want to upset the emperor again.  The story of the conversion was then composed as a coded allegory involving his predecessor Abgar V and Jesus, rather than himself and Pope Eleutherius. \nSt Peter had probably taken the burial cloths to Antioch.  It is possible that they were used to assist the conversion of the Edessan court, and then returned again to Antioch.  This may have provided the opportunity to compose the Mandylion “in choice colours”, and at some time a story of the imprint of Jesus was included in the legend.  Also at this time, the Edessan poet Bardesan composed the Hymn of the Pearl, which suggests that he had very likely seen the full Shroud image.  \nBoth the Shroud and Mandylion were concealed at various times depending on the political climate of Christian persecution, Persian invasion, or confiscation of church treasures to be rediscovered in subsequent years.  Possibly copies were made.  At various times Byzantine iconoclasm played a part, some icons being destroyed unless they were hidden,   \nAround 540 AD the Persian king Chosroes I, attacked and destroyed Antioch.  If the Shroud was in Antioch at this time, it was taken away for safety, either to Edessa, or more likely to Cappadocia.  The religious situation was also complex at this time, including such heretics as Gnostics, Arians, Docetists, Nestorians and others.  At various time some of these seemed to have had possession of the Mandylion or the Shroud.  \nI recommend the following two papers by Markwardt, which cover this period: \n“Antioch and the Shroud”, Markwardt 1998, Dallas Conference,\n http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf\n“Ancient Edessa And The Shroud: History Concealed By The Discipline Of The Secret” Markwardt 2008, Ohio Conference,\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf  \nThese two papers should be read in conjunction with his 2014 St Louis paper. \nNote that at the time of the 1998 and 2008 papers, Markwardt had supported the Mandylion theory, and this is reflected in these papers.  However he has now abandoned it as set out in his more recent “Modern Scholarship” paper.\n\n","date":"August 6, 2015 at 6:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hello Louis, Re Cathar Crucifix: \nPaper “THE CATHAR CRUCIFIX: NEW EVIDENCE OF THE SHROUD’S MISSING HISTORY” By Jack Markwardt,  2000, can be found at:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markwar3.pdf   \nThe paper does not provide an image of the crucifix, nor could my Google search discover an image that conforms to its description, and I’m unaware of any artefacts held.  The principle source, possibly the only one known, is the description provided by a Catholic prelate, Lucas of Tuy, who confronted the Cathars in Leon after some who were seeking refuge settled there in 1218.  He is also known as Lucas Tudense, Lucae Tudensis, and El Tudense.  He authored the Chronicon Mundi, an update of St Isodore’s great chronicle, and was subsequently appointed bishop of Tuy in 1239. \nQuoting Markwardt: “Between 1229 and 1234, Lucas wrote “De Altera Vita, Adversus Albigensium Errores” (The Other Life, Against the Errors of the Albigensians) which detailed various Cathar tenets and religious practices and betrayed his own pathological hatred of heretics and Jews.”  Markwardt acknowledges the “efforts of Paul C. Maloney, Vice President and General Projects Director of the ASSIST Investigations Group, in locating and reproducing this relatively forgotten work and the fine translation of its medieval Latin text by Mark Guscin.” \nIn De Altera Vita, Lucas reports that the Cathars manufactured a most unusual crucifix.  Briefly, Markwardt interprets Lucas’ description of it as comprising a vertical stake (but without patibulum), an inscription, and a footrest; that Christ was attached to it with only three nails with but a single nail through his crossed feet; that Christ was pierced in his left side by a Roman lance; and that He was hung from a crux simplex with his arms extended above his head, and hands or wrists nailed to the upright stipes. \nThis is most peculiar.  First, the Cathars denied the reality of the Incarnation, repudiating Christ’s human nature, and claimed that neither his death nor resurrection had been a physical reality;  Second, they held relics and religious images in low esteem;  Third, having manufactured a crucifix they departed from ancient crucifixion traditions dictating the shape of the cross, the number of nails, and the location of the lance wound.  \nFurthermore, given their rejection of the Eucharist and the Mass, the Cathars should not have claimed to possess Christ’s transubstantiated body, and yet they did invite the leader of the Albigensian Crusade to see the body of Christ that had become flesh and blood in the hands of their priest.  \nMarkwardt endeavours to resolve these anomalies by proposing a set of Sindonic Solutions, that, following the disappearance of the Shroud from Constantinople, it came into the hands of the Cathars through their coreligionists the Bogomils, creating a crisis forcing the Cathars to face the reality of the crucifixion.  Barbet of course interpreted the blood-stained feet of the Shroud as having been crossed and fastened with but a single nail, but the Cathars failed to recognise that the Shroud imprint was a mirror image and hence claimed the lance wound as being in the left side, and furthermore they were persuaded that his hands were nailed above his head.  \nIf in fact the Cathars had been in possession of the Shroud and had held it in the region of Languedoc (the main area of their population), after being forfeited to the Crown, it would then be properly assigned to the Charny family.  In a footnote, Markwardt observes: \n“In the Spring of 1349, Charny’s royal annuity was modified to include the first forfeitures that might occur in the Languedoc senechaussees of Toulouse, Beaucaire, and Carcassonne. This grant is preserved in the Archives Nationales JJ77 #395, folio 245 and is hand-copied in the Wuenschel Collection.

It may at one time have had thorns on it, but they have long disappeared having been dispersed around various destinations as a donated relic from the “true crown of thorns”.  It accounts for the circlet type of crown seen on various western art works of Christ wearing such a crown.  The type of crown worn by various eastern monarchs was more like a type of helmet, such as seen on coins issued under Abgar VIII the Great of Edessa for instance.  The head wounds evident on the Shroud image, would indicate that the actual crown worn by the TSM matches the helmet type of crown.  It is one small argument for the Shroud’s authenticity, as a western origin for the image would be more likely to reflect a circlet in the pattern of the head wounds.  If the Paris relic is at all genuine, then it may have been used to keep a helmet style of thorned crown in place.\n\n","date":"August 7, 2015 at 9:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Following your suggestion, I have “trawled” through a series of images for ancient crowns.  I conclude that a helmet type is not as disproportionately small as you assert.  There is considerable variation in the styles.  They were quite often modeled on the pileus.  Searches on ancient types of Assyrian, Egyptian, Persian and Indian crowns quite often show this type.  In some cases it comprises a circlet but surmounted by 4 to 8 overarching arms to the specific regal symbol atop, usually with some type of fitted satin cap.  Ancient Greek crowns seem to have been of the circlet type; Roman types were usually worked in the form of a laurel wreath circlet. \nOf the crown of thorns, St Vincent of Lerins (d. 445) states (Sermo in Parasceve): “They placed on his head a crown of thorns; it was, in fact, in the shape of a pileus, so that it touched and covered His head in every part.” (cited by Barbet) . \nBarbet also comments that the Notre-Dame “crown of thorns” that St Louis obtained from the Venetians in pledge for a loan, is actually a circlet made from plaited rushes, and that ancient authors from the time of Gregory of Tours have said that the crown was made of sea-rushes, which in the immediate environment of Jerusalem would seem a little peculiar.  However if this circlet crown is at all genuine, then it was clearly intended to hold the thorns on the head. \nThe wounds and blood-stains on the head of the TSM are highly significant and are not as incidental as suggested in your previous comment.  They are a significant pointer to the identity of the TSM, as Jesus of Nazareth is the only crucifixion victim recorded as having been inflicted with the gratuitous and unusual punishment of a crown of thorns.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2015 at 4:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh, I believe you are mistaken.

The coin is of course Byzantine and not Syrian nor Edessan.  It bears a striking resemblance to the Shroud facial image. \nIn 1998, Wilson first mentioned the Homs vase (The Blood and the Shroud, Free Press, 1998, p. 141) in support of his Mandylion theory.  He stated that it was “a silver vase discovered at Homs, the ancient Emesa, in Syria”.  He failed to mention that, in the 6th century, Emesa was a Byzantine, rather than a Syrian city.  This omission therefore creates an impression of unjustifiably identifying the vase with the Image of Edessa.  \nEmesa is well to the south of both Antioch and Edessa, and perhaps because of this a misperception can easily be made.  Christians were slow to settle in Emesa because of the strength of the sun-god cult there.  A Semi-Arian, Eusebius of Emesa, a friend of Constantius II was appointed bishop in 339, but because of his unorthodoxy the Emesan inhabitants expelled him.  An orthodox bishop Silvanus was executed by Julian the Apostate in about 361 and the Christian basilica was for a short time made a shrine to Bacchus.  Another 4th century bishop Nemesius is the author of an extremely important work “On the Nature of Man, the first known compendium of theological anthropology with a Christian orientation. The treatise considerably influenced later Byzantine and medieval Latin philosophical theology.  By the 5th century Byzantine Christianity was well-established and it became an important Byzantine centre for Eastern Christianity.  The emperor Heraclius was obliged to abandon the city to Rashidun Muslims following the decisive Battle of Yarmouk in 636.     \nSo for some 300 years then, Emesa was a centre of Byzantine Christianity.  The Homs vase must date from within this window, and it is therefore definitely Byzantine.  \nIn his 1998 book, Wilson first mentioned the St. Catherine Pantocrator icon (p. 159), dating it to the 6th century, but, here again, he failed to mention that this Sinai monastery was founded by Justinian I and that, therefore, the icon is undoubtedly Byzantine, and not Edessan, in origin.  \nHistorians, unfamiliar with the Shroud likeness or unwilling to ascribe it as a source of the imagery, are prone to attribute the images of the Pantocrator and the Justinian II 692 solidus to the Phidias Zeus, an impressive 13 m high statue.  Images of the statue are easily found on the web, and those more familiar with the Shroud image will be unimpressed by such a claim.\nIn 2010, Wilson noted how Justinian II, after 705, issued coins bearing a non-Pantocrator Christ face, but he then boldly asserted, with no historical support, that these later coins were “almost certainly” based upon the Image of Camuliana, while the earlier coins were based upon the image of the Shroud that could be found upon the Image of Edessa (The Shroud, Bantam Press, pp. 151-152). He also again mentioned both the St. Catherine Pantocrator icon and “the silver vase that was found in Homs in Syria” (p. 135).  \nThere is no basis whatsoever for attributing the 705 solidus to the Image of Camuliana, in fact it is more likely to have been based on a Syrian origin (Grierson).  A likely explanation is that the superstitious Justinian II, having faced a series of earlier defeats, had decided that representations of the Image of God Incarnate on his coinage had met with divine disapproval, and hence changed the image of Christ to one that more closely reflected his human nature. \nThe Image of Edessa probably first came to imperial notice in 787 when iconophiles at the Second Council of Nicea raised it to celebrity status by claiming it as a proven palladium that could save a city from conquest.  Imperial desires to expropriate the relic were realised in 943 when John Curcuas succeeded in negotiating an agreement with the Islamic authorities.  Until the arrival of the Mandylion at Constantinople on 15 August 944, and its inspection by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos, there seems to be no reason why the Byzantines should have had any prior knowledge of the likeness of the icon.  \nNevertheless there are at least three primary Byzantine images of Christ of the 6th and 7th centuries which may be seen as close likenesses to the Shroud image and which predate the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople:  the St Catherine’s Pantocrator, the 692 solidus, and the Homs vase.  \nWilson’s perplexing association of these artefacts with the Image of Edessa, effectively drew attention away from both the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, where the Image of God Incarnate had been present from at least 574, and also from the Byzantine province of Cappadocia where this same image had been present from at least 554.  \nI hope that this brief summary may dispose of any doubts concerning the weaknesses in the Mandylion theory proposed by Wilson and subsequently by De Wesselow.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2015 at 7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Louis, this crown is of course the traditional circlet.

Note that Wilson claimed that the full length image that he supposes was on the Mandylion only came to light sometime after the Mandylion’s arrival at Constantinople in 944 AD.  A somewhat similar reference is found in a text by Pope Stephen III ca 769 AD.  Both references reflect an earlier memory of a full length image, already in Constantinople, but which had been hidden away, and which had now been erroneously attributed to the Edessa image.    \nBoth Wilson and De Wesselow seemed to accept these texts at face value without penetrating any further.  This confusion is addressd in Markwardt’s 2014 St Louis paper: “Modern Scholarship And The History Of The Turin Shroud”:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf   See Chapter ‘The Blurring Of Image Texts’  p.53 at seq.  \nMarkwardt addresses the reason why the full-length image in Constantinople had been hidden away in his chapter ‘The Imperial Covenant With God’ pp.48-52.  \nThe source is contained in a document known as the Tarragon manuscript, and refers to an imaged linen cloth which was always kept in a golden case and very carefully locked up.  The ms describes how a series of continuous earthquakes threatened the city, and how a heavenly vision revealed that the city would not be freed from the quakes until the sacred linen was locked away far from human eyes.  And so it was done and the earthquakes stopped.  “From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake.” \nThis cloth cannot have been the Mandylion, which was often displayed to many persons on several occasions, both in Edessa and in Constantinople.  There was only one other known such cloth in Constantinople, the ‘Image of God Incarnate’ and it follows that this was the cloth that had been locked away. \nThis series of continuous quakes must be identified with those commencing on Oct 26, 740 and they continued for the next 12 months.  The emperor Constantine V interpreted the quakes as a divine sign that the Image of God Incarnate should not be viewed nor used for any imperial purpose, sealed it away in a golden case, and coincidentally the quakes ceased.  This Covenant with God effectively consigned the Shroud to four and a half centuries of complete obscurity.  \nThere remained the memory of the full length body image, but it became erroneously associated with the Mandylion.  \nOnly the emperor was permitted to open the golden case and view the image.  In his youth, King Bela III of Hungary was educated at the Byzantine court and for a time was betrothed to the emperor’s daughter.  As heir-designate he would have been permitted to view the image, and this may have enabled the Shroud-like illustrations in the Pray manuscript, following his being crowned king of Hungary in 1173.  \nThe Imperial Covenant with God was eventually broken by Alexios III Angelos (1195-1203) probably in 1201.  This is evident in a statement by Nicholas Mesarites referring to reenactments of the resurrection at the Pharos chapel involving the sindon that had wrapped the mysterious naked body after the Passion.  Robert de Clari of course refers to a similar reenactment at the Blachernae church in 1204. \nFor the full story you need to refer to the Markwardt paper.  The Mandylion theory espoused by Wilson, and more latterly by De Wesselow has found many objections from historians aware of its defects, and they rightly complain that it has obscured more fruitful lines of enquiry.  However there has been a considerable authenticist intellectual investment in the theory, and many are still reluctant to abandon it.  \nI consider that Markwardt’s research has made a major contribution towards getting closer to the real truth of the history of the Shroud as the real burial cloth of Christ.\n\n","date":"August 9, 2015 at 4:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/04/from-constantinople-to-lirey-through-the-sainte-chapelle/","cat":"history","title":"From Constantinople to Lirey through the Sainte-Chapelle"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I see such skepticism as the natural and normal human reaction to the biblical literalism of the evangelical church movement, who failed to understand what the Bible really is.

There are several aspects which one could comment on, but I’ll contain myself to only a few observations. \nHis suggestion that storage in the Gates of the Cherubim at Antioch, is very likely the basis of the story that the cloth was found in the Gates at Edessa has the ring of truth.  We can only speculate what Bishop Abraham may have been told by the Edessans, it was no doubt second or third hand and very likely whatever was said became subject to the usual “Chinese whispers” variations; Add some court embroidery and the Byzantine story requires some skilful penetration to discover what truth one might find. \nI note that Mr Markwardt draws on the Syriac poem, Hymn of the Pearl, compiled at or near Edessa ~200 – 224 AD, and it seems fairly conclusive that the particular verses in question can only refer to the complete Shroud image!  Clearly the full image must have been known at least to a select few in Antioch or even Edessa as early as 224 AD.  \nPrior to the destruction of Antioch ~540, the cloth was taken from Antioch to Edessa, in whatever form it had at that time.  In the Byzantine story, we are told that the Edessans attempted to pass off two false cloths (a copy made for the “Persian affair” and another worshipped in the Nestorian church).  THESE WERE GIVEN BACK, ONLY THE ONE WHICH WAS THE TRUE ARTICLE WAS RETAINED.  \nI suppose it is possible that there may have been a few other ancillary cloths in Abraham’s package, possibly including even the Sudarium of Oviedo.  However we have the situation where the Shroud is housed at Edessa, a city which is subsequently destroyed, but that Bishop Abraham is now satisfied that he has the true cloth.  It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the cloth in Abraham’s possession is in fact the Shroud, in whatever form it had at the time.  The only other possible conclusion is that the Antiochenes took the Shroud to some other city, for it to emerge in Constantinople at some later date, and that Abraham had some other cloth in his possession, which all in all seems a fairly unlikely proposition.  There seems to be more to Ian Wilson’s hypothesis that the Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object, than Yannick Clement seems prepared to concede. \nThe “Discipline of the Secret” is also an intriguing topic, which is also raised in Rev Dreisbach’s Atlanta 2005 paper, “Lazarus and Jesus” dealing with the Shroud during apostolic times, but which of course needs to rely on more speculation and less historical substantiation than Mr Markwardt has been able to bring to his own paper. We also see something of this discipline in apocalyptic works such as John’s Revelations. \nRegardless of any particular lack in detailed accuracy of Ian Wilson’s work, I believe Wilson has done more than anyone else to bring awareness of the Shroud into the public domain, possibly with only one or two exceptions; he had to work within the limits of material available to him, and I think it discourteous at best for his work to be denigrated in the way that it has been on this site on occasion. \nAll in all, I believe we are getting closer and closer to a detailed knowledge of the early history of this wonderful artifact, the Love Letter of Jesus to Humanity in our milllenium.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2012 at 10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/29/history-done-right/","cat":"history","title":"History Done Right."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Mike M’s refs, particularly to Barbet, gives the lie to Charles’ assertion that the scourging did not break the skin.

In the first and second centuries, any Christian or heretic could write what they wanted, as there were no ecclesiastical controls before a movement towards canonicity became established.  The Gnostic movement under Marcion and Valentinus was particularly active in this, and was roundly condemned by Iraeneus.  Other Christian apocrypha sought to resolve certain conflicts, or were highly inventive to express certain theological points.  For example, one notorious writing has two mid-wives at Jesus’ birth expressing amazement that Mary was still a technical virgin (presumably intact hymen) in order to confirm the doctrine of the virginal birth, and reflecting the cultural context of the time.  One mid-wife puts her hand in and it withers as a punishment for this impertinence. \nIf the fragment is genuine, I would see it in the context of an internal conflict within a gnostic sect as an attempt to settle a dispute about whether its members shoud marry or not.  By saying that Jesus was married it would seek to establish marriage as a valid life option for them.  \nThe vast majority of exegetes affirm that Jesus was not in fact married.\n\n","date":"September 20, 2012 at 3:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/19/hot-new-topic-the-wife-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Hot New Topic: The Wife of Jesus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is by no means settled as to whether the fragment is or is not a forgery.

The present owner is said to wish to remain anonymous but it is interesting that there are also reports that he wishes to sell it.  In the meantime he seems to have granted permission for Harvard to hold the fragment so it can be tested and examined by scholars.  Non-destructive tests are proceeding on the ink to see if it can be identified as authentic or not.  There are comments from some experts who claim that it appears to be genuine while others are not so sure. \nKaren King is Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard, a highly pretigious posting;  She is not an archaeologist, but a BA & PhD in Religious Studies, and was asked to examine the fragment by the owner.  She seems to have been associated with some feminist trends in Religious Studies, and I also note that she has also worked with Elaine Pagels who wrote controversially on Gnostic Studies a few decades ago.  \nShe has submitted a draft report for initial publication: “Jesus said to them, ‘My wife…’” A New Coptic Gospel Papyrus, by Karen L. King with contributions by AnneMarie Luijendijk.\nFor those who wish to follow it up for more information, PDF can be found at:\nhttp://news.hds.harvard.edu/files/King_JesusSaidToThem_draft_0917.pdf\nThere is considerable information in the paper about the fragment, what is known of its provenance, a translation and an extensive commentary with footnotes and citations. \nThe fragment is said to have been written in the fourth century, the scribal work is inferior, is suggested that it is a copy of an earlier Greek work from mid-2nd C, and appears to have connections with both the Gnostic Gospels of Thomas and of Phillip.  King has used the appelation “gospel” only to identify the fragment as a means of describing it. \nIf the fragment is proved to be authentic, that is 4th C, then it might be interpreted as reflecting a possible conflict within a particular gnostic sect as to the merits of celibacy versus marriage.  This conflict was also apparent within early Christian orthodoxy, because of the early expectation of the Parousia.  Paul himself although allowing marriage, seems to have considered celibacy a better life option.  By asserting that Jesus himself was married, the original author whoever it might have been, would be attempting to make a claim to validate marriage within his sect. \nThe general consensus among scholars is that Jesus did remain celibate, the lack of any reference to a wife itself being strong negative evidence of this. \nBy following the various links in the original posting above, you can come across some rather cute witticisms about Jesus being married, sample comments: “I can’t take you anywhere; we go to the temple and you topple the tables”; “So you’re a carpenter; then fix up the kitchen cupboards!” Etc.\n\n","date":"September 20, 2012 at 2:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/19/hot-new-topic-the-wife-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Hot New Topic: The Wife of Jesus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The quoted verses certainly appear to relate to a Shroud-like image, not merely a facial image as shown on the Mandylion.  It follows that the Shroud image was very likely known by a select few in Edessa, as the Hymn of the Pearl is asserted to have been written in Edessa.  In my opinion, Scavone makes a strong alternative case for the Shroud to have been kept at Antioch, where the first Jewish Christians became strongly established after 68 AD.  Prior to the destruction of Antioch he says it was taken to Edessa, and there are strong literary parallels between the Shroud being kept hidden at the gates of the Cherubim at Antioch and the story connecting the discovery of the Edessa image in the gate at Edessa.   \nFollowing the death of Abgar, his heirs returned to paganism, although the earliest Christian church in Edessa was ~200 AD.  Scavone’s hypothesis is that with this return to paganism, the Shroud was temporarily returned to Antioch, which explains why there is no recollection of the image in Edessa during the visit of Egeria.  \nFrankly I don’t give a fig for any dogmatic assertions about whether the Mandyion and Shroud were one and the same object or not, regardless of who makes them.

It was removed from the Lirey Church by Margaret and her second husband Humbert for safe-keeping in 1418 and duly receipted, as it was plain that in this small village church, it was a vulnerable target from the English, marauding Jacquerie, and various acquisitive clergy jealous of its pilgrim attractiveness, and various French officials.  \nFrom 1418 Margaret and Humbert held annual expositions on the banks of the Doubs River and additional displays elsewhere, Liege 1449, Macon 1452.  It seems that the Savoys had expressed an interest in purchasing it, and political conditions in France remained uneasy.  Despite two marriages Margaret remained childless and with increasing age likely felt the weight of responsibility in ensuring an ultimate secure home for her precious relic.  \nIn 1452 she finally decided that the safest haven for it was with the House of Savoy who compensated her with the castle and estates.

The linguistic evolution from “Abgar” to the “Arthur” of the Grail legends would seem plain enough.  There is also the Glastonbury legend with its connection to Joseph of Arimathaea.  \nIt is Markardt’s contention that the apostle Peter took the various Passion relics to Antioch, including the Shroud, and his papers on this have been discussed at various times.  In 1098 crusaders captured the city of Antioch and claimed to have discovered the hiding place of the Holy Lance of Longinus.  Curiously another artefact which might well be the true Grail was discovered there as recently as 1910.  \n“In 1910, local Arabs unearthed, at the traditional site of Antioch’s ancient cathedral,42 a silver chalice comprised of an unfinished inner cup and a finished outer holder, akin to a reliquary, exquisitely decorated with ten human figures, in two groups of five.43 Professor William Newbold has noted that only in the middle of the first century did two groups of five men each govern the respective Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch and only at such time would a Christian religious object have displayed such a depiction.44 Dated to the first century and considered genuine by many archeological and scientific authorities,45 the Great Chalice of Antioch has been called “a most sacred Cup, in all probability the one\nwhich once served the Lord and his disciples at the Last Supper, the most precious object in Christian history, legend and tradition”.46 ”  “Antioch and the Shroud”, p.4, Markwardt, 1998-99.   The numbered references include citing of Eisen, Gustavus A., The Great Chalice of Antioch, Kouchakji Freres (New York 1923).  \nIn a separate paper, Markwardt has also proposed an alternative 1204 – 1355 route from Constantinople to Western Europe.  He considers that the Cathar Crucifix may have originated as a result of the Shroud coming into the possession of the Albigensians at Languedoc in Southern France, through their connections with the Balkan Bogomils sect, which had similar doctrines.  In the early 14th century the Cathars were suppressed, and subsequently Geoffrey I de Charnay acquired the Shroud pursuant to a royal grant.

It prompted me to check out a few demographic comparisons.  \nAustralia is somewhat similar to USA, although Baptists do not figure so prominently. Catholics are about 25% of the Australian population, as with USA. Part of this may be due to a heritage of England trasnportation of Irish convicts and the discriminatory laws during the early colonial era. In USA it has been sustained by Mexican/Spanish immigration. Judaism in USA is about 1.7% of the total population, with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. In Australia the 2006 census reported Judaism as only 0.3% of the population. \nThe situation in NZ is quite different. A now nominally secular society, Catholicism was stable at about 14% of the total population for several decades.  It had about the third or fourth largest following of the Christian denominations, after Anglican (= Episcopalian) and Presbyterianism (Scottish immigration). Methodism (= Wesleyanism / Welsh) also featured. The latest censuses quote Catholicism in NZ at about 12.3% of the total population, but it now has the second largest following after the Anglicans. Some of this is due to immigration from the Philippines and other SE Asia or Pacific countries. \nJudaism in NZ is minuscule compared to Australia and USA. About 3,800 claimed to be of the Jewish faith in the latest census, in a population of about 4,000,000, i.e. less than 0.1%. Some writers have claimed that up to about 10,000 NZers may be Jewish. As elsewhere, both Jews and Catholics are more prominent and influential in public affairs than their numbers would indicate – they both pull beyond their weight. There have been about two or three Jewish Prime Ministers of NZ, one of whom converted to Christianity. The present Prime Minister, John Key had a Jewish mother, but he claims to be agnostic. There have been at least four Catholic premiers or prime ministers of NZ, and the present Minister of Finance Bill English is a prominent Catholic.\n\n","date":"September 16, 2013 at 12:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/14/intellectual-dishonesty-in-shroud-of-turin-research/","cat":"history","title":"Intellectual Dishonesty in Shroud of Turin Research"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Where were the brothers at the crucifixion?

The sources he quotes and uses are necessarily sparse.  It is pointless to demand further evidence which no longer exists, and one must make the best of whatever sources are in fact available, even if sometimes questionable, or open to other interpretations.  The track is further compromised by the early Christians need for secrecy, and their systematic use of obscurity  for protection against persecution, particularly of such items they deemed important or valuable. \nHe gives a credible explanation for the concoction of the Abgar legend, believing it to be an allegory to record the conversion of the court of Abgar VIII the Great, but so written to conceal the true facts from imperial authority.  He suggests that Bishop Avercius Marcellus was given temporary custody of the Shroud to assist in this conversion, and that the contemporaneous Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl composed in Edessa, together with the epitaph inscription of Avercius reflect this occasion.  Other evidence is also mustered to support his argument.  When Antioch was about to be destroyed by Chosroes’ Persian invasion ~540 AD, the relics were taken to Edessa, which had by then become a major centre of Syriac Christianity of diverse beliefs and practices.  The contemporary legend of the image’s discovery in a wall at Edessa would seem to be an adaptation of an event that actually occurred in Antioch, merely to explain its emergence in Edessa.      \nWhether or not the hypothesis that the Mandylion and the Shroud were one and the same object, can be sustained or not, is a matter that needs further exploration.

My preferred position is essentially one of neutrality, in that I continue to be open to the possibility that Talpiot may have been the last repository of the Jesus family ossuaries. Certainly, no-one can be in a position to assert it as such. \nThe allegation that the Mariamne/Mara ossuary is that of Mary Magdalen, seems mainly to rest on the 3rd century Valentinian Gnostic gospel of Philip, where she is named a favoured companion of Jesus, hardly a persuasive source. I would suspect that the author’s purpose might simply be to ratify marriage as a legitimate lifestyle, unless he had a more lurid intent. I understand that this ossuary is unusually ornate and the inscription, unlike the others, is in Greek, clearly setting it apart from the others. \nCharles Pellegrino has adopted a much more cautious approach in his assertions than has Jacobovice. He considers that any ossuaries at the Holy Sepulchre site would have been moved from there in about 40AD, when the city walls were extended, so that any claim for Talpiot does not compromise Holy Sepulchre as the original burial site. He also believes that no skeleton was ever placed in the Jesus ossuary, which he claims only contained a small carpal bone and cloth fragments. The name “Jesus(?) son of Joseph” is apparently preceded by a cross-mark.    \nPellegrino’s response to critics is: “If nothing else but an ossuary inscribed with the words ‘Jesus, son of Joseph’ were found in a tomb, bearing fibre evidence indicative of a missing body and two apparently sacred cloths, if these are indeed the two cloths described in John’s gospel, with a cross-mark attached to Jesus’ name, and a star on the lid – and if the antechamber bore a symbol known to the Jesuit order to this day as a glyph, translated as ‘Jesus Saviour of man’ – – if nothing else had been found, we would all be crazy not to look on with a sense of mystery and wonder.” We may interpret this how we may. \nOther acceptable explanations for the oddities in the chamber are easily found. For example the “Judah son of Jesus” might be explained by adoption, but passed off as a brother for his own protection.  Conceivably he may have been the disciple described in John’s gospel as the disciple whom Jesus loved. The various names are listed in Mark 6:3 “Is he not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?”  \nThe statistics I used for my Monte Carlo simulation were the Rahmani statistics of 286 names appearing on 231 ossuaries in a population of 917, some 686 being uninscribed. Witherington also gives a fairly similar proportion of names in the Jewish population of the time.    \nFollowing Meier’s lead, I would have no problem with the brothers and sisters being directly related, although adoption would protect the doctrine of perpetual virginity, if that were an objection. \nI find the unusual combination of names a little too significant to ignore. Sadly the matter has now been too badly handled, for any satisfactory conclusion ever to be made.\n\n","date":"December 29, 2013 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/28/it-continues-james-son-of-joseph-brother-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"It Continues:  James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Charles, I note your repeated reference to “icon” in Markwardt’s 2008 paper.

His source for the Athanasius quote is the original Latin as given in Dobschutz.  \n“…but two years before Titus and Vespasian sacked the city, the faithful and disciples of Christ were warned by the Holy Spirit to depart from the city and go to the kingdom of King Agrippa, because at that time Agrippa was a Roman ally. Leaving the city, they went to his regions and carried everything relating to our faith. At that time even the icon with certain other ecclesiastical objects were moved and they today still remain in Syria.

The particular verse has been a little contentious.  Why would Paul be concerned about a cloak for himself when he could easily obtain one for himself in Rome?  Or is he concerned that Timothy have a cloak for his journey?  How come Paul has been in possession of the Shroud, if that is what is claimed, when it is far more likely to have been in Peter’s possession; And why would he leave it behind with a mate in Troy of all places; even it was at all credible that he was using it as a visual aid for his missionary work? It would seem most unlikely that the other apostles would permit him to do this?  [It has been asserted that Bishop Marcellus Avercius of Hieropolis was permitted to use it for this purpose for the conversion of King Abgar VIII’s (the Great) court in Edessa around 185AD, before returning it to Antioch where it was kept.] \nThe authenticity of II Timothy is uncertain.  My JB Introduction to the Pauline epistles acknowledges that some assert it as pseudonymous.

Author of this section may have included the following:  The Rev. Krister Stendahl: Bishop of Stockholm, 1984-88. Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Divinity, Harvard University, 1981-84; Dean, Divinity School, 1968-79. Author of Paul Among Jews and Gentiles and others. … ; …Emilie T. Sander: Associate Professor of New Testament, Yale University, 1973-75. Coeditor and translator of The Bible and the Role of Women.” \nI can agree that you may very well be correct in your assessment that the original was written in Hebrew and translated into Greek,  and this may  possibly have been as late as the 2nd century, which is when the article asserts the date of the idiom,  This may explain the problems that the authors have in attributing it to Paul. \nI consider that the evidence that Paul was ever in possession of the Shroud is extremely slender and speculative, notwithstanding the claims made by David Hines.  Paul’s first preaching was in Damascus [Acts ch 9]; Barnabas appears to have been an intermediary between Paul and the Church in Jerusalem [Acts ch 11]; Paul’s first mission is to Pisidia and his preaching there (first to the Jews) is set out in Ch 13.  A summary of his subsequent preaching elsewhere follows in the relevant chapters in Acts.  Nowhere in Acts, nor in Paul’s general epistles is there any hint that the Shroud played any kind of role in his missionary work.  \nYour interpretation of the word “phailonen” is intriguing, but I don’t see that it alone is sufficient to assert that Paul was ever in possession of the Shroud.   I would doubt that Paul was ever made aware of it.  For David Hines to say that Paul would have demanded it from the apostles to aid his missionary work verges on the absurd.  It is to credit Paul with a greater strength of charisma that the apostles would have been prepared then to acknowledge.  Some of them had their own missionary objectives to attend to. \nTo David Hines: For an alternative and more credible theory on the whereabouts of the Shroud I recommend two papers by Jack Markwardt:\n“Antioch and the Shroud”, Dallas conference 1998, and “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET”, Ohio conference 2008;\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf\n\n","date":"May 20, 2014 at 4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/14/jesus-long-hair-again-and-again-and-again/","cat":"history","title":"Jesus’ Long Hair Again and Again and Again"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I know of one theory that equates “the beloved disciple” with a presumed adopted son of Jesus.  Because of then high mortality rates, many orphans were prevalent in ancient times, and other family members would then adopt them.  Adoption gave the same legal rights as birth.  Because of Jesus’ claim to be a king his identity was kept secret as his life would be in danger as the natural heir.  If a king was defeated and killed, there was a need to forestall the possibility of pretenders to his succession.  He is variously identified with one of the named brothers in Mark’s gospel, the one who leaned on Jesus’ breast at the Last Supper, the one who fled naked in the garden leaving his pyjamas behind (Mark), the disciple present at the crucifixion, and the original author of the fourth gospel.  Clearly not all of these would necessarily apply to the same person. \nAdrie van der Hoeven’s 2011 paper “The Turin Shroud as John Mark’s temple garment” offers some fascinating speculations on the origins of the Shroud, and makes a good case for its originally being a temple garment.  It is certainly worth reading, but unfortunately seems to suffer from an apparent confusion associating the writers of the first and fourth gospels as the same person, and this would seem an unlikely identification.  \nAs to the authorship of the fourth gospel, Encyclopedia Britannica offers the following: \n“Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown.” \n“Because both external and internal evidence are doubtful, a working hypothesis is that John and the Johannine letters were written and edited somewhere in the East (perhaps Ephesus) as the product of a “school,” or Johannine circle, at the end of the 1st century. The addressees were Gentile Christians, but there is accurate knowledge and much reference to Palestine, which might be a reflection of early Gospel tradition.”  \n”  … The author of John knows part of the tradition behind the Synoptic Gospels, but it is unlikely that he knew them as literary sources. His use of common tradition is molded to his own style and theology, differing markedly with the Synoptics in many ways.” \n” … Confidence in some apostolic traditions behind John is an organic link with the apostolic witness, and, from beginning to end, the confidence is anchored in Jesus’ words and the disciples’ experience-although much has been changed in redaction. Traces of eyewitness accounts occur in John’s unified Gospel narrative, but they are interpreted, as is also the case with the other Gospels. ” \nWhether the author of the fourth gospel can be identified with the author of Revelations, (identified as John written on the island of Patmos) is also a credible possibility:\n“The “Johannine circle” bearing the tradition of John, the Apostle of the Lord, and from which emerged the Gospel and letters bearing his name, might have been a continuation of the prophetic conventicle of Ephesus in which John was prominent. The various writings do not have to be consistent except in their basic faith in Jesus Christ; and, as the situations to which they addressed themselves were different, different styles and content were required.”\nHence the differences in style are not sufficient to dismiss a claim that the different writings may have had the same author.\n\n","date":"November 15, 2014 at 2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/15/john-of-john-the-servant-of-the-priest-that-also/","cat":"history","title":"John of . . . , John the . . . ,  Servant of the Priest?

John Mark scriptural refs are of course: Acts: 12:12 (Peter’s refuge from prison); 12:25 (Saul returns to Jerusalem with Barnabas & John Mark); 13:5 (accompanies Paul on mission journey), 13:13 (John leaves them at Pamphylia); 15:37 (Paul declines Barnabas’ suggestion that Mark accompany them, replaced by Silas); Col 4:10 (he was cousin to Barnabas, and he was then back with Paul).  He is mentioned as disciple of Peter in I Pet 5:13.  II Tim 4:11 (may be pseudonymous but has Paul asking for Mark’s help).  \nThe name Mark is not mentioned in the Witherington stats of Jewish names and is not mentioned in Rahmani stats of names on Jewish ossuaries.  I had assumed that it might have been adopted from some type of Romanism (Marcus is a very common Latin name),  The inference I take from yours above is that it was likely a type of family name or title associated with the Maccabees. \nJohn, son of Zebedee, is a leading apostle of Jesus, apparently enjoying his special favour, and tradition has marked him out as the author of the fourth gospel. He is Galilean, from a fisherman’s family, an unlikely candidate for a priestly scribe, and none of the gospels name him as John Mark.  From John’s gospel, the “beloved disciple” took the mother of Jesus into his home, and there is a site in Ephesus that lays claim to this.  Most exegetes seem to favour the final redaction of the gospel by a Johannine school in Ephesus.  If Revelations has the same author, then it was written by John on the island of Patmos nearby (I think a prison colony).  Contrariwise there is a tradition that John Mark was missionary to Egypt, and the Coptic Church has a strong tradition in this regard. \nI think there are many things about these times that will never be known because of a deliberate policy of secrecy by the early Church, as a defence against imperial and Jewish persecution.

(e.g: Matthew has Jesus preaching from a mountainous place like Moses, whereas Luke has him preaching from flat ground).  It also helps Matthew to get the family into Nazareth, (because of Archelaus) as Matthew did not know that they were Galileans originally from Nazareth, as did Luke know.

However there’s some little confusion concerning eclipses.  Only Luke says “with the sun eclipsed”, other gospels merely say it was dark.  The only way that there can be a SOLAR eclipse is for it to occur after Old Moon and before New Moon when the sun becomes hidden; But this timing does not fit in with the time of Pasch which occurs at Full Moon!  You can have a LUNAR eclipse at Full Moon, but if so, it would not appear so remarkable as to darken the sky in the afternoon and would not cause comment; Only the face of the Full Moon would become hidden.  The sun would still be visible.  The cause of the darkness has to be the Ruah Qadim, the Dust Storm.\n3) Obviously Joseph of Aramathea must have intended both the tomb and shroud for his own burial, for them to be so immediately available to him,  If the present Sindon we know was in fact the Shroud he used, then it was not the sort of weave that one would buy off the shelf, he’d obviously imported it or purchased it sometime beforehand, possibly from Syria, assuming he had originally intended.that this expensive cloth be used for a Shroud rather than for some other purpose.\n4) Even allowing Max his 2 1/2 hours for observing the prescribed burial rites, I see a problem in the way that the image appears, and his assertion that the body was completely wrapped.  The problem is that there is no lateral image, which if some natural process was involved, would surely show up if the body was completely wrapped.  But both the frontal and dorsal image appear as they would in a frontal and dorsal photograph, with no lateral imaging at all.\nWhat kind of process could have limited the image in this way?  Are we expected to think that there were a pair of convenient lightning bolts taking frontal and dorsal images and projecting them onto the cloth? Or if they came from some mysterious power from within Rabbi Yeshua that he was able to command so that only frontal and dorsal images would show?\nIf a natural process is the cause of the image, then It is rather more credible to see the body laid on the bottom half of the cloth where the dorsal image will appear, and for the top half to be brought over the head and over the body for the frontal image to form, without any further wrapping.  The top half of the cloth could be weighted down with some of the 100 lb of mixture left over.  This to my mind is the only credible way that no lateral image would show up.  Otherwise, please explain why there’s no lateral image!!\n\n","date":"March 19, 2012 at 7:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The links between Othon de la Roche and Jeanne de Vergy acquiring the Shroud were first presented by Daniel Scavone at the 2008 Ohio conference.

I have never had a lunar eclipse hypothesis about the cause of the darkness;  Having had an active astronomy interest for some decades, I have been very well aware for many years that a SOLAR eclipse could not occur at Pasch depite it being so implied in Luke.  My reference to a LUNAR eclipse was merely an aside to say that it was possible to have had a LUNAR eclipse instead.  As the Full Moon would not rise until some time around 5:00pm to 7:00pm, it can hardly be attributed to have caused any kind of darkness in the early afternoon.  I have always suspected that if the darkness did indeed occur, (and all three Synoptics say it did) then it had to be some other phenomenon such as a dust storm.  The person called Max gave it a name and I merely did him the courtesy of alluding to it in my note above.\nI doubt if Max can claim proprietary rights over the origin of the Shroud as only a moment’s reflection will yield the answer – it is an expensive piece of cloth, perhaps not originally intended as a Shroud, but was pressed into service as being readily to hand. Joseph seems to have been the generous minded sort of fellow who would readily be open-handed about this act of generosity.\nConcerning Ron’s comments in his last para above, a regular dust storm may have been familiar to both Matthew and Mark, but it is entirely consistent with their scriptural intent to assign a supernatural significance to the timing of it in association with the crucifixion, and it heightens the drama.  Luke does not have the same familiarity with Jewish lore, and so assumes and attributes it to a solar eclipse, which is mistaken.\nAlong with Ron, I am not convinced by the wrapping hypothesis.  If the body’s sides were packed with insect repellent flora, then one should see some degree of graduation or fading at the edges of the two images, frontal and dorsal, where the “packing” starts, but the image edges seem to be relatively sharp.  I think the question remains open, and it seems to me that the photographic-like orthogonal projection of the image favours a mere draping of the cloth over the body, possibly with some temporary weighting using the ingredients left over.\nI don’t expect Max to agree with any of this, and I half-expect that he will find some deliberate way of misinterpreting what I have said.\n\n","date":"March 19, 2012 at 5:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A truly sad case!

The encyclical of Pope St Pius X.”Pascendi Dominici Gregis” September 8, 1907, which the historian Anne Fremantle has described as “longest of encyclicals”, sought to address the problem.  I’m afraid it makes for some fairly tiresome and heavy reading.and could only recommend it to serious students of the movement,  A more succinct syllabus of errors “Lamentabili Sane” of July 3, 1907 lists some 65 specific errors to be condemned.

With their emphasis on the spiritual, “true knowledge” and denial of the significance of the corporeal, Gnostics would have no good reason to manufacture such a relic.

The issues faced by a Pius X were certainly different from those now faced by a Benedict XVI, and the world is very different now.

It had to be the beginning of a true awakening.  \nJohn’s mention of quantum mechanics, brings to mind that even in 1905, the renown physicist Ernst Mach was still able to deny the very existence of atoms.  Today subatomic particles are the stuff of everyday life in our communications, and our understanding of material existence.  The political emphasis has now shifted away from the concerns of European national.states of those times, to the global village and political awakenings in Asia and Africa.  The interim has seen the rise and fall of Soviet Communism, two major world conflicts, civil wars, an Arab Spring, and the rise of radical Islam   There is now the potential for some fool with the power to do so, to destroy this fragile planet from the very stuff of quantum physics, through nuclear destruction.  In the meantime, the rest of us set about doing much the same in a questionably more benign manner by industrial pollution, the elimination of the Creator’s work through the destruction of species, and continue to exploit the vulnerable through their forced labour in sweat shops. \nThe image of the suffering Christ depicted on the Shroud may awaken us to His reality in history or herstory as the case may be;  We can ask why this had to happen;  Was this the Redeemer of humankind?  Did His sufferings open the gates of heaven as the old theology would have it?   Or else we can go deeper and ask what was the message of this god-man?  That message was Love!  Real love, without reservation!  He asks that we follow Him in His example of Love!  This man was certainly a radical, overturning conventions that imprisoned the culture of His time.  To probe deeper into the message is the task that every generation must pursue each in their own era, to bring about God’s kingom on earth. \nMay the blessings of Christmas be yours:  To Yannick, Max, Chris, John, Gabriel, Anoxie, Kelly to David, Davor Colin and Hugh and all those who regularly contribute to this wonderful site, and especially to Dan who keeps us all attuned with such regular and provocative postings.that we may become all the more enlightened.\n\n","date":"December 24, 2012 at 6:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/23/paper-chase-the-conspiracy-against-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase:  The Conspiracy Against the Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think these may be the first papers I have read by Pam Moon, and they are delightful.

She was previously Professor of Ancient History (1978-89) and Professor of Late Antique and Byzantine Studies (1989-94), at King’s College London. At Oxford, she is Chair of the Advisory Committee on Honorary Degrees and also sits on committees for Conflict of Interest, Select Preachers, and the Wainwright Fund.\nIan Wilson’s repsonse to her several objections on his hypothesis runs to some 27 pages.  To me it seems to be an effective and complete response, (but then I’m just an ordinary layman who imagines he can recognise the truth of a sound argument).  I dare say it would also cover several, if not all of Mr Clement’s objections.  For after all, I believe it unlikely he is as well qualified as Professor Averil Cameron in such matters, in fact by comparison a “minnow” = “1, a small slender European cyprinid fish, … 4, a small or insignificant person” (Collins).  Of course this is also only a joke, isn’t it, from another “squarehead”!  But nevertheless, to be fully informed on such matters, as he apparently claims to be, perhaps he should download the paper and read it for himself. \nThere is one thing in common that all these Byzantine scholars share, including Mr Clement.  Not one of them has ever come up with an altrnative hypothesis on the whereabouts of the burial cloth, except DA who apparently claims it to have been in “Neverland”.  Wilson’s hypothesis is the only one, so far, that has ever attempted a coherent and complete theory, even if it contains minor errors in its details,  I patiently wait to see an alternative credible hypothesis!

He deals with her objections in great detail, and for me seems to be an effective response to all those Byzantine history scholars who object to his thesis.

It scarcely derogates from the soundness of Wilson’s argument in response to Cameron.  \nIf I interpret Max correctly, at #15, 2/, I think he is identifying the Mandylion with the Manoppello relic, but that it is NOT of a “not made with human hands” icon, but in fact a man-made copy of the sindon image.  From what little I’ve read of Manopello, I’m inclined to concur that it is indeed a man-made icon, and that the face geometry is a close fit with the sindon image.  However if the Mandylion was in fact a separate object from the sindon, then another case can be made for it having been with other relics hoarded in Paris and destroyed during the French Revolution, and that Manapello may be yet another different copy.     \nComing back to the sindon:  If it is indeed the burial cloth of Christ dating from the 1st century, and there are several reasons supporting its authenticity as we all know, then it had to be located somewhere.  Unless one is to believe the ancient Abgar story, which looks increasingly unlikely because of Edessa reverting to paganism, then its most likely first destination after 68 AD is Antioch, where the Apostolic church first became established.  Possibly it was taken there as early as 47 AD.  But it could not have remained in Antioch much after 525-540 AD, because of its destruction by a great fire, two earthquakes, and finally Persian Chosroes I, invaded all of Syria and destroyed Antioch in 540.\nThe Abgar legend may have its roots in the conversion of Abgar the Great, around 190 AD, and the subsequent establishment of Edessa as a major Christian center.  The sindon and/or a copied icon, may have been taken to Edessa for a brief visit from Antioch at this time, giving rise to the story.  So we have the destruction of Antioch no later than 540, and the emergence of the Edessa image in 544 AD, at the time of Chosroes’ abortive attack on Edessa.  All of this is comprehensively traversed in two papers presented at conferences by Jack Markwardt in 1998/99 and 2008.  Both papers are well documented and properly referenced, the most recent one at: http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf .  Similarly the other can be found by checking out the 1998 conference. \nThe Shroud and other icons could not have been preserved in Edessa after 1146, when it fell to Turkish Muslims.  The most likely explanation is that it was taken from there by John Curcuas, the Armenian-born commander of the Byzantine army in 944.  \nWhere else could the sindon have been: Armenia? St Catherine’s monastery at Sinai? Ephesus? All unlikely, and there’s no case to be made for them! Nevertheless, Icons apparently based on the sindon image, appeared all over churches in the Middle East, even as far as Armenia and Georgia. Early in the fourth century, the easterns discovered what happened to relics when they were revealed to Helena, they ended up at the imperial court, where Constantine made a talismanic bridle for his horse from one of the crucifixion nails.  There was good reason not to reveal the whereabouts of the sindon and other holy images.  \nIt is hardly surprising that the whereabouts of the Shroud has remained an enigma for so many centuries.  However it is an enigma on which the likes of Ian Wilson, Jack Markwardt, and various others have been able to shed some illuminating research, which they have approached industriously and comprehensively, from the purest of motives.  Any comparison with the likes of the charlatan Dan Green is utterly odious.\n\n","date":"July 19, 2012 at 12:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/17/paper-chase-all-sorts-of-papers/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: All sorts of papers"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There is already extensive comment on this paper on this site’s posting of August 26 “Barrie Schwortz Announces (etc)”, beginning with my own comments at #5.

You’re probably aware that he makes a case for Othon taking (or sending) it to his home church in Bensancon, for which there appears to be some tradition. I understand that Burgundy was independent territory at the time, although both France and German interests had designs on it. A strong point for his case is that he is a direct ancestor of Jeanne de Vergy, wwhereas I find it difficult to see how Geoffrey de Charney could have come by it otherwise except by way of her dowry. The weak point of his case is that much of the Besancon church records were destroyed, either by fire sometime around 1350, or in later centuries by the turmoil of the French Revolution.\nThe Templars may have known about it, or else something very similar, hence the Templescombe image, but what is the case for their actually having it in their possession?

Thus Crispino: “Nicolas Idruntino who, furthermore, writes that after the sack of 1204 he saw the precious relics of the Passion with his own eyes; the “othoni” and the “soudarion” among the others..”. \nOn page 6 of his paper, Scavone mentions the same reference and comments: “In this passage, the key words are “with our own eyes.” The question must be asked as to just where it was that Nicholas actually saw the linens. To answer this, we must add what he says in another context: that, in 1206, Benedict and he had traveled to Athens and to\nThessalonika debating the same questions of Church unification with the\nGreek theologians.” Scavone postulates that Nicholas saw them in Athens, that the list (mentioned by Crispino) is what was taken from Constantinople, and refers to the use of the Latin pluperfect tense and the Greek imperfect tense, as arguments that these were no longer in Constantinople.  \nThe two papers (Crispino & Scavone) need to be examined and considered very closely as to the relative weight to be given to each. For Othon de la Roche to have secured the Shroud, it had to be in Athens soon after 1204. Othon is also an ancestor of Jeanne de Vergy, and it would seem peculiar that Geoffrey de Charny would have been given such a valuable relic purported to be Christ’s burial cloth, in return for any kind of service he migh have rendered, notwithstanding that he was appointed to bear the oriflamme.

The point had already been made personally to me a number of times by a close friend, a priest, a conservative, who teaches theology in a NZ seminary, and whose opinion I happen to respect despite some friendly disagreements at times.  Perhaps there may have been elements of this in the Abgar legend. However the focus in the legend is very much on the cloth with the image, and it seems to me that the story is of a type that seeks to explain the origin of the cloth, which was apparently deemed sufficiently important to require such an explanation. You will know of many such stories I’m sure, there are several such in the older parts of the OT, particularly Genesis and Exodus, and also in much folklore, primal and ancient religions etc. Something unusual, even if only a landscape feature, needs an explanation, often supernatural or legendary! \nWhile not necessarily agreeing with all the elements of Markwardt’s paper, I think he makes an excellent case of why Abgar VIII chose to place the story in the time of Abgar V, that it was for political reasons, to protect himself against Roman authority, as it suddenly became just a little too dangerous for him to admit to his conversion. However the discovery of the cloth seemed just too important an event not to make a record of it, even though couched in arcane language.  \nIf the story is to be regarded as seeking a claim to being an apostolic see, I doubt that Edessa would have allowed itself to be subject to the church at Antioch.

You will therefore have to believe in some multiplicity of cloths with images of Jesus. I should be reluctant to do so. \nI take it that you have now read Markwardt’s 2008 paper. In that case we will have to agree to differ on the merits of Markwardt’s 2008 paper. I note that there is no record in the gospels of Jesus multiplying images of himself for general wholesale distribution. It is also unlikely that the Shroud would have been sent to Edessa, a then pagan city, so soon after the crucifixion, as there are several references to it being kept elsewhere, including being kept by Peter, or being given to Pilate’s wife, and also being kept in Syria. \nI therefore find it more credible that the Shroud was hidden in Antioch, and with the impending destruction of the city by earthquake and by Chosros, that it may then have been taken to Edessa in the time of Abgar VIII, leading to creation of the legend. Alternatively, it may have arrived in Constantinople by some other different route entirely.\nFinally if Edessa was evangelised in apostolic times it would have claimed for itself a status of being one of the primary patriarchates, which it did not, nor never did, despite it subsequently being a major centre of Christian scholarship.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2013 at 3:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"O.K.: I think you may be clutching at straws.

The only evidence for an apostolic conversion of Edessa is the Abgar tale, which by the 5th century was deemed a fiction.

I have read both previously, the story about Izates, earlier today, and which certain others have unduly embroidered as I mentioned above. Ian Wilson makes the point that Edessa is not that far from Antioch, compared to other missionary journeys undertaken, and that it would be remarkable if some attempt had not been made to evangelise the city. However, in all cities that Paul ever visited, he always preached to the Jews in their local synagogues first. It seems that there had to be a Jewish presence in the city beforehand. Was there one such in Edessa? I’m not sure whether that is known or not, the local gods were Bel & Nebo. \nActs states that it was Ananias who baptized Paul, but under protest. Was it the same Ananias who instructed Izotes? We don’t know, but there was a very limited number of names in those days, and it may have been a different Ananias. There is no reference to baptism in the Izotes story; Izotes is to be accepted into the Jewish faith, and there is no mention of Jesus, even obliquely. Now suppose that the Abgar legend was set down in the time of Abgar VIII. There are two 1st century local stories circulating about a messenger named Ananias, one about baptizing Paul, the other about converting a nearby king into the Jewish faith. Therefore in writing up a story about the conversion of Abgar V, the messenger will also be called Ananias, because that’s the sort of thing Ananias did and he’s a prime 1st century candidate for the role! So really I think we end up no wiser about the true situation at all. \nI think the point of all our discussion on this, concerns the timing of the arrival of a cloth with an image of Jesus on it, which became known as the Image of Edessa. We don’t know if that was the Shroud as Ian Wilson claims, or whether it was something else. It is possible that Abgar V may have been baptised; if he was, Christianity in Edessa was nonetheless short-lived. The story about Addai arriving in Abgar V’s court with such an image, does seem to be a subsequent attempt to explain the arrival of the image, with the purpose of enhancing the status of Edessa. Pope Gelasius in the 5th century considered it spurious, and a fiction. I think it more likely that such icons would have been secretly and carefully guarded by trusted members of the early Church, and that any taken to Edessa, would only be because their safety was now threatened and Edessa had in that time become the safest place to keep them.\n\n","date":"October 27, 2013 at 7:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/24/paper-chase-thomas-the-hymn-of-the-pearl/","cat":"history","title":"Paper Chase: Thomas & The Hymn of the Pearl"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Here’s something for O.K.: Incidentally my comment about pseudo-scholars above was directed at about three of them while I was checking out your Ananias.

Little seems to be known about him. His being called the Zealot may merely have been to distinguish him from Simon Peter. He is supposed to have preached the gospel in Egypt and then joined the apostle St Jude (Thaddeus = Addai) in Persia. According to the apocryphal Acts of Judas & Simon, he is supposed to have been martyred there by being cut in half by a saw, one of his iconographic symbols. But according to St Basil the Great, 4th c. Cappadocian Father, St Simon DIED PEACEFULLY IN EDESSA! [That would have to be late 1st century and no later than early 2nd century!) The connection of Simon with Thaddeus (= Addai) and also Edessa, is at least suggestive, particularly if Simon was able to die peacefully there.

There are clearly several elements in the story which can only postdate the crucifixion and resurrection. The section describing Hanan painting Jesus, may be Eusebius’ explanation of the image (shades of Bishop D’Arcis) but I believe the Image of Edessa was something more than this. I get the impression you are much more ready to accept the story at face value than I’m able to. There may be a few elements in the story reflecting memories of actual occurences. As I said previously, it would be remarkable if there had not been some apostolic attempt to evangelize Edessa, because of its relative proximity to Antioch. I could accept for example that Abgar V may have been converted to Christianity, but it’s by no means certain.\nI feel inevitably drawn to the conclusion, that any such special images of Jesus, whether Shroud or Manopello, or anything such, would have been secretly kept by trusted members of the early Christian community, and not distributed elsewhere, regardless of whether the prospective recipient was a king or not. I see the story as written to explain the eventual arrival of the image in Edessa, taken there because its safety had come under threat, and Edessa had now become the safest place to relocate it. Its arrival there had to be explained, but the explanation given I think cannot be accepted as factual. Markwardt’s attempt to rationalise the origin of the story may be closer to the mark than it would seem you’re prepared to accept. One merely has to change the names of the participants, because it had become dangerous to identify who they actually were.  \nConcerning the frequency of names in apostolic times: Of 917 Jewish ossuaries, most of them probably 1st century to 70 AD, there were 286 names on 231 inscribed ossuaries.

That is by no means established and some historians have occasionally argued against it, but only perhaps because of their own particular perspective. \nThe Abgar legend purporting to refer to King Abgar V, a contemporary of Jesus, and the establishment of Christianity in Edessa in apostolic times may in fact be a blind. I think it was Eusebius who denounced the Abgar legend as a forgery. Jack Markwardt argues that the Abgar referred to in the legend is in fact Abgar VIII (the Great) but for political reasons, it was written as a legend referring to the earlier Abgar to avoid the attention of the Roman emperor and the prospect of persecution.  It seems likely that Christianity was established in Edessa no later than 200AD, but not much earlier. \nMarkwardt has several very early references which may refer to the Shroud. He argues that the TS was kept and hidden in Antioch, not Edessa, and the story of its discovery in the walls of Edessa is in fact an adaptation of its actual discovery in Antioch, when it was then taken to Edessa because of the impending destruction of Antioch. \nReferences by Jack Markwardt: “Antioch and the Shroud” (1998) http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf  \n“ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” (Ohio, 2008)\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf  \nIt would be a major detective task working through the tangle and attempting to resolve the various elements in all three papers by Dreisbach and Markwardt.

Markwardt makes the point that if Edessa was christianised in apostolic times, it would never have become subservient to the the Antioch church, which seems a valid point. His explanation of why the legend was made to refer to Abgar V, rather than to Abgar VIII, was a ruse to record an important religious event in Eessa’s history, while diverting political attention away from Abgar VIII becoming Christian. “Only the names were changed to protect the guilty.” It is also unlikely that a Christian missionary would seek to evangelize a king unless invited to do so. It seems that sons of Abgar V were pagan in any case, and any latent christianity in Edessa would soon be suppressed. I don’t think the charge of scholarly prejudice holds in this case.

In addition the author reviews whether these two topics are indeed connected or not.  \nThe Relationship between Ossuary Burial and the Belief in Resurrection during the Late Second Temple Period Judaism by Dina Teitelbaum; Carleton University, Canada 1997.  So it’s a little dated, but well researched, considered and presented.\nhttp://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq22102.pdf     \nI learnt a lot from it and it’s well worth taking the time to read through it, by those interested in these two topics.  \nSecondary burial in ossuaries may have commenced in Jerusalem as early as 50 BCE and continued into 70 AD;  With the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish diaspora, the practice drastically diminished, and with Hadrian’s edict excluding Jews it ceased in 138 AD.  Subsequently secondary burials became established in Southern Galilee.  Rahmani is known to assert that the practice only commenced during the Herodian period from 20 BCE, while others asserted it can be dated to 200 BCE, but this early date is not now generally accepted. \nAuthor considers that the first affirmation of Jewish belief in resurrection is only found in II Maccabees and afterwards, from about 168 BCE.  She sees it partly as a reaction to the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, and to some extent, reaction to the Book of Job, “Why do bad things happen to good people, while evil-doers prosper?”  She also connects it with Ezekiel’s earlier ‘Valley of Dry Bones’, although most exegetes have seen this text as referring to post-exilic Jewish resurgence.  She also connects the concept with the pervading Greek influences on notions of the soul.  \nThe relative scarcity of ossuaries (perhaps only some 2000 are known), in relation to demographic considerations, suggest that their use was principally a privilege of the well-to-do, and not necessarily associated with, nor an essential corollary to a belief in the resurrection of the body.  But the issues involved are examined in considerable detail.  She refers to the site known as the Caiaphas family tomb, and it would therefore seem that a Caiaphas ossuary would not necessarily imply his belief in the resurrection, nor need it be considered paradoxical.  \nShe observes that whereas some ossuaries have been ornately well-decorated, the inscription of names is often rough, suggesting that inscriptions were not made in the work-shop, but possibly on site.  This of course might imply that the names were not inscribed accurately, by those sufficiently well-lettered to do so, and hence inaccuracies might therefore be expected.  There may therefore be no great significance in any presumed mis-spelling of any occupant’s name on their ossuary.\n\n","date":"August 4, 2014 at 6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/01/paul-maier-at-the-veritas-forum-the-real-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Paul Maier at The Veritas Forum: The Real Jesus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"DA: ” ‘Given all textual and iconographic evidences, what was the most likely location of the Shroud between 5xx-944?’ – Neverland. ”\nDA thus demonstrates the limitations of individual single specialities / specialists in coming to any kind of rational decision on complex problems.

The ordinary familiar Egyptian cubit is 18 inches = 457mm.  .  The Royal Egyptian cubit was about 4 digits longer at  524 mm = 20.62 inches, and a granite stick was used as a standard.  There were several other cubits around, the general idea being that it was the length from elbow to finger tip.  \nThe Shroud dimensions are 4340mm x 1090mm, so it’s a direct aspect ratio of 4:1, within 20mm.   So the cubit used for the cloth was about 4340 / 8 = 542mm.  That’s about 18mm longer than the Royal Egyptian, but there were even much longer cubits [e.g. Royal Persian “cubit(?)” is quoted as 640mm].  I found several sites that tended to concentrate around the 524mm, occasionally found bigger ones, but eventually dropped on to a site (which looks like it has a fundamentalist agenda, but is probably authoritative when it comes to cubits):\nhttp://www.worldwideflood.com/ark/noahs_cubit/cubit_references.htm\nIt quoted the Assyrian cubit at 700 BC as 549mm = 21.6 inches.  Its source reference is given as http://www.footrule.com which seems an authoritative source, but the site takes some navigating. Eventually it gives you the figure of 21.6 inches for the Assyrian cubit.  The 542mm which seems to be the unit on the Shroud cloth is actually closer to the Arabic cubit, but it was the Syrians who had the reputation as weavers.  Multiplying the Assyrian cubit by 8 gives a length of 4392mm, about 5cm (2 inches) longer than the Shroud.\nMake of these notes what you will!

Guralnick in 1996 postulates the three cubits as Max mentions: Standard Late Assyrian cubit 51.5cm; Royal cubit (religio-mythological royal emblemata) 56.6cm; Slab featuring King Sargon 55cm; all as stated by Max.  As I read the abstract, I surmise that the King’s 55cm cubit was comparatively rare, and that the more usual Royal cubit was 55.6cm.  It would seem that the “footrule” site I’ve mentioned above in quoting 549mm (Assyrian 700 BC) is based on Guralnick’s rare King’s cubit of 55cm.\nThe width of the Shroud cloth at 1090mm is suggestive of a cubit of ~545mm, which is ~3cm longer than the standard cubit, and about 1cm shorter than the usual Royal cubit.\nThe cloth is almost certainly of Syrian weave (cotton contamination and 3:1 twill) and it seems a puzzle to me why a larger than standard cubit was used just for a cloth.  There has been some suggestion (van der Hoeven in 2011) that the cloth was originally intended as a temple garment, and if there was a known religious purpose for the cloth, this might explain why its measurements approximate to Royal cubit measure.

It was originally published in French and translated into English by the ‘Earl of Wicklow’ in 1953.  My copy is by Image Books published in 1963.  I am unable to comment on its present availability.  It is considered the classic study of the wounds on the Shroud.  Not only was Barbet an experienced forensic pathologist, researching the crucifixion wounds by experiments on cadavers and amputated limbs, he was also a competent classics scholar having access to several ancient Greek and Roman resources, to support his analysis.  The section on scourging is at Chapter 4, ‘The Preliminary Sufferings’ which also includes the mocking and buffeting in the praetorium and the crowning with thorns.  \nDr Fred Zugibe more latterly, disagreed with some of Barbet’s analysis, alleging errors in his work.  Learned opinion seems to be divided between the merits of the two.  It is well worth attempting any effort to secure the book if you can, even searching second-hand book stores if necessary.  Possibly it may be found in some University Library.

I see some unresolved problems that need further clarification. \n1) Barbet seems to have envisaged a flagrum fitted with two pellets, as the shape of the scourge wounds are in the form of a dumbell.  He asserts that the arms were held above the head for the simple reason that there are no scourge marks on the forearms.  He assumes that the victim was somehow made to face a post, as the great majority of the scourge marks are on the back.  He seems to explain the much fewer wounds on the chest by the thongs whipping around the body.  This could only occur if the pellets were at some distance from the ends of the thongs.  \n2) If the victim was made to face a post with his arms bound to it above his head, this would not preclude the thongs wrapping around to strike the non-central front of the chest.  Alternatively the arms may have been bound to an overhead beam, when free access to the chest would be possible. \n3) There are many comments that could be made about the Faccini-Fanti paper.  First, there has been considerable Photoshop remassaging of the images used for the analysis, using the tools for ‘noise-reduction’, ‘cloning’, ‘correction brush’, ‘filter-diffusion’, and a few others.  This might be thought to raise questions concerning the integrity of the imagery they obtained.  The authors claimed to distinguish three kinds of marks.  They carried out some scourging experiments using a 60 cm drum, cloths, white paper and carbon paper.  They illustrate a weapon with three pellets on each of four thongs, but used a three thong flagrum, each thong having two pellets at its ends for the experiments. \n4) They do not accept the proposition that the thong marks are caused by the scourging thongs as asserted by Barbet, but assert that this was by a different implement, and that these marks do not match the pattern of scourging.  They envisage they were imposed by lictor type virgae rods.  They simulated these using flexible pear rods.  They seem to infer that these were inflicted as some kind of preliminary punishment.  I suspect it more likely that they were imposed during the journey to Golgotha. \n5)  Their Fig 1 shows very many marks on the front of the chest, but their discussion on the wound sites seems quite limited, and not fully explored. \nI can only suggest that readers make of this paper what they will.  My own conclusion was that I needed to know a lot more about their findings than was given in the paper.

St Paul as a Roman citizen (inherited from his Tarsus forbears) suffered only 40 lashes.  However there appears to have been only practical limits for Roman soldiery inflicting the punishment on non-citizens.  These only needed to survive with sufficient strength to be able carry the cross-bar (patibulum) to the place of execution.  The gospel accounts report that Jesus needed assistance from Simon of Cyrene to do this, hence the scourging punishment was likely extreme.  \nThe advantage of tying the victim’s hands above his head to a post would seem to be that if he fainted, the punishment could still continue without undue interruption, although you’ve mentioned revival with salt water.  I am unclear as to whether the victim was normally suspended by his arms alone, or whether it was more usual for him to have feet on the ground support as well.  Most of the scourging wounds are on the dorsal parts of the body and legs, suggesting there was no scope for the body to rotate if suspended.  \nThe paper by Faccini and others, suggest that lictor type fasces were also used to encourage progress of the journey to the place of execution.\n\n","date":"August 9, 2014 at 5:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/09/request-for-help-can-you-point-me-to-some-information-on-roman-scourging/","cat":"history","title":"Request for Help:  Can you point me to some information on Roman scourging?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Please save the trees!!\nNote that bruising only (= contusions) would leave no residual mark on the Shroud cloth.

He concludes by saying:\n“I would defy any modern painter, unless he is a surgeon, with a thorough knowledge of the physiology of coagulation, and meditated for a long time on all the possible avatars of that thin thread slowly coagulating in the midst of the obstacles, to imagine and portray this image of the frontal clot.

Please do not talk of it!  This image, and it alone should be enough to prove that nobody has touched the shroud except the Crucified Himself.  And it is one image among a hundred others.” \nWe might accuse Barbet of excessive hyperbole.  But he knows his pathology and his forensics.

Their end-point is the triumph of the resurrected Jesus.  They are written almost clinically as an objective report on what happened rather than exploring the existential aspects.  This was left to later mystics and visionaries who interpreted them as such.  There is really no case that the scourging was a mere chastisement.

There are all together too many aspect to it.  \nConsciousness creates a serious problem in materialistic philosophy.  For example it cannot do justice to the concept of intentionality, and the distinction between the mental and non-mental.  Thus the materialist will have problems in developing a mechanistic theory of mind. \nHowever we can also recognise various levels of consciousness perhaps in connection with neurological disease, from full alertness, through a continuum to stupor, sleep and coma.  These various levels will generally have a material origin. \nConsciousness is required, not merely in the observation of the merely physical world, which seems to be the nub of Professor Raman’s article, but also in the recognition of the abstract, such as symbolism, appreciation of art, exercise of imagination in reading a work of fiction, and indeed even in understanding the meaning of understanding.  \nConsciousness has an important role in the observation of the physical world, but here we run into the problems of quantum mechanics, in that the state of a subatomic particle cannot be known until it is observed.  This was a question hotly debated by Einstein, Schrodinger, Heisenberg and others in the first half of the 20th century.  John Cribben’s work “In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat” articulates the problem for the ordinary lay reader.  The mystery of parity at a distance is a very peculiar problem indeed. \nIt appears to be a reasonable assumption, that the physical work should in fact exist, without the necessity of it being observed, that is – requiring consciousness.  However it is extremely difficult, and possibly hazardous to one’s health, if an attempt is made to make the argument on grounds which are rigorously logical.  It may well be in a similar category as Godel’s Theorem of Undecideability. \nAs noted in the header, it is “Off Topic”, although it may have some metaphysical significance in our general discussions.

Is Resurrection Fundamental to the Shroud Image?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I shall endeavour to confine my response to Yannick’s very long posting above, to only a few points.  I feel that much of it is a repetition of remarks he has frequently made before, and I see little point in sustaining a long to-and-fro argument about these. \n1) chromophore: It seems reasonably certain from what we have read, that indeed the chromophore lies in the impurity layer of the cloth, rather than in the textile itself.  It would add to our understanding of the image if this matter could be confirmed by further investigation.  However the now restricted access to the cloth is unlikely to allow further samples to be taken in the near future.  Any further testing will need to be limited to already exisitng samples. \n2) miracle or natural process?:  I suspect that Yannick & I will continue to have differing views on this matter.  I have already stated  aspects supporting the miracle hypothesis as: (a) no dorsal deformation (bluntly – the buttocks and shoulder blades do not appear to be flattened as they would expect to be from the body weight, assuming the body was laid on its back – most likely position) – it as if the body was suspended in space; (b) the projection of front and dorsal views with no image of the sides, as might otherwise be expected from a Maillard reaction – the edges of the front and dorsal images are relatively sharp; (c) the fairly high definition of the image (modified by previous comments by Anoxie & Gabriel). \nClearly the Vatican authorities are unlikely to proclaim the image as miraculous until all scientific avenues have been explored, which again is unlikely to be any time soon.  Meantime personal viewpoints as to whether the image is miraculous or natural will depend on how the various results to date are personally perceived and interpreted. \n3) Seismic activity as cause of image:  I dare say that Yannick in his seismic quiescent province of Quebec, probably has little understanding of certain aspects of seismic activity.  Despite my entreaties for him to do so, I rather suspect he has neither read nor understood Giovanna de Liso’s paper on her 12 years of experiments in Piedmont.  Section 2(b) of her paper describes in detail her use and treatment of the textile samples she used.  She seems to have made some effort to simulate the conditions of the Shroud cloth.  Unfortunately the PDF of her paper is secured so that copying and pasting of the relevant extract isn’t possible without retyping.  Meantime the seismically inert Quebecois may brand this cause as absurd if they so wish, but that doesn’t make it so! \n4) Identity of the Shroud man: I have already written an article on the identity of the Shroud man, and Dan posted a reference to this some weeks ago.  The article can be found in a copy of the Tawa Catholic News which I edit and produce quarterly:  “The Holy Shroud of Turin  2) Identity – Whose image?” By David Belz, Tawa Catholic News, Winter 2012, pp 29-34.

To me, I feel you are insisting too strongly on an overly strict reading of John 19:40.  On the other hand I am prepared to be open to every possibility until it is CONCLUSIVELY proved otherwise.  Elsewhere within the last day or two, I have already commented that the absence of dorsal deformation could be explained by the body being laid on its side.  I cannot agree that the burial cloth being draped loosely over the body is a gratuitous comment, as it is a real possibility; As is also the possibility that the burial halakha rites were completed.  My comment above was merely to identify a few arguments which MIGHT support a supernatural cause of the image, as against a naturalistic explanation.  \nIt seems to me that everwhere we turn to search for any kind of naturalistic explanation we seem to encounter difficult problems, of one kind or another.  I am prepared to concede that some elementary observances were probably carried out, such as binding the jaws, and the feet; The hands were not bound to the extent that a wrist wound is plainly visible. \nAgainst the burial cloth being tightly bound around the body, are the following arguments: (a) the 3D encoded properties correlate with the loosely draped model used by Jumper & Jackson for their distance calibrations; (b) If the burial cloth was wrapped tightly around the body and the image was due to a Maillard reaction, we would expect to see a very different image from the one that is manifest; (c) both frontal and dorsal images are what we might expect to see if they had been produced by projecting the frontal and dorsal light pixels on to a more or less flat screen.    \nIt may be that the halakah rituals were observed, but likely modified to ensure that all the blood was conserved.  I concede that the imminent sabbath would not seem to hinder this – I understand that observance of burial rites were in fact a permitted sabbath activity.  Absence of light may have been a practical difficulty.  However if you insist that the body was completely wrapped, then my response would have to be that in that case the image cannot comply with a naturalistic explanation and that it must have been miraculous.  Those who would prefer a naturalistic explanation would conclude that the body was not tightly wrapped in the burial cloth, as otherwise a different image would have resulted. \nTherefore I fail to see how you can assert that the body not being completely wrapped is a received idea from arch-miraculists, when in fact a loosely draped body provides a better naturalistic explanation for the manifest image.  Any kind of wrapping at all would never deter an arch-miraculist! \nOne problem with a loosely draped body, is that very likely it compromises any kind of gaseous diffusion model, as it would allow the gases to escape,  A naturalistic explanation would then need to look elsewhere, such as the seismic activity explanation I have suggested as a possibility.  This is what I meant when I said that everywhere we turn, we seem to encounter difficulties in searching for a naturalistic explanation.\n\n","date":"August 10, 2012 at 6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/09/off-topic-is-consciousness-fundamental/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Consciousness Fundamental?

Following Cyrus’ release of the Jews from their Babylonian Captivity, those who had taken foreign wives were excluded from returning to Jerusalem, many of them settling in Egypt, the Arabian peninsula and elsewhere.  In 324 BC Alexander founded the city of Alexandria, and following his death his successors there became the Ptolemaic dynasty.  Ptolemy II was persuaded to establish the Great Library, and it accumulated a vast wealth of learning from the many travelers passing through it.  Alexandria became a centre of both Greek and Jewish culture, for example the Septuagint being written there.  But it was essentially a cosmopolitan city, and the ideas from many cultures were melded there.   \nThe two main influences I believe that contributed to the development of the concept of resurrection and an after-life were 1) the Jewish exposure to Egyptian burial practices with its belief in an after-life; 2) their exposure to Platonic philosophy, with its concept of an eternal soul, its theory of ideals, and the concept of the One.  The hierarchy in Jerusalem, the priestly caste with its temple cult, who later became the Sadducees, rejected this notion, but it took root among the Pharisaic  movement, which also happens to owe something to Persia, particularly Zoroastrianism, dualistic notions of good and evil.   \nIn the Gospel of John, we read that Jesus asserted that Abraham saw His day and was glad, and he quotes David’s psalm “The Lord said to my lord ‘Sit at my right hand … “.  It is very clear that Jesus embraced this idea of an after-life, and seems to make the claim that the concept was always present in Hebraic thought.  \nThe most avid of the early churches missionaries seem to have been the Hellenists, who with their Greek culture, were able to embrace this fundamental Christian belief, so that together with the ideas of brotherly love and high moral standards, it became the principal stamp of Christianity.\n\n","date":"August 2, 2014 at 4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/02/the-key-to-understand-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Key to Understand Resurrection?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“The previous posts from the above commenter have included:\na) a defence of the “Jesus family tomb”\nb) a defence of Bart Ehrman\nc) a comment saying the Resurrection of Jesus, that he was raised bodily, is difficult to accept\nWhy should I read “It has nothing to do with Unitarianism.

He is a former Evangelical, and like many such scholars brought up in the Evangelical religion rejected it and became an agnostic.

This part of Isaiah is indeed written by the prophet that exegetes call “First Isaiah”, either Isaiah himself or his contemporary followers about 740-700 BCE. \nThe USCCB version includes the following note concerning this verse:\n“[26:19] This verse refers not to resurrection of the dead, but to the restoration of the people; cf. Ez 37. The population of Judah was radically reduced by the slaughter and deportations that the historical disasters of the late eighth and seventh centuries B.C. brought upon the country. In this context, a major concern for the future was for an increase in the population, a rebirth of the nation’s life.”\nThe verse needs to be read within the context of those preceding it v.v 1-18.  \nNevertheless, regardless of prophecies relating to resurrection and the after-life, and we might include Isaiah’s enigmatic prophecies of the suffering servant (e.g. ‘my servant shall prosper … ) which have similar messianic themes, they could only take root among the people where there was the fertile soil to do so.  They could only be understood where there was a capability of understanding.   Any development of resurrection theology occurred late in Jewish thought, and it was not universally accepted among them.  It was certainly not the view of the hierarchy isolated from such influences in Jerusalem, notwithstanding the proclamations of any prophets.

My maternal grandmother, my Nana, was one of these last, and I remember a picture of the Shroud face she kept on her cottage wall.  But it generated little informed discussion among us as children.  The work of such pioneers as Yves Delage, Paul Vignon, and Guiseppe Enrie was a closed book to the grreat majority.  For most Catholics, their knowledge of an image of Christ was confined to the legend of Veronica from the popular devotion of “The Stations of the Cross”. \nAs a student undergraduate in 1960, our Dominican university chaplain had shown a group of us a slide presentation of what was then known of the Shroud.  Very likely it had been based on the work of Pierre Barbet, which he first published in French in 1950, and was translated into English only in1960.  Intriguing as his presentation was, it generated no further sustained interest from our Catholic student body.  Between 1969 and 1973 further investigative work was initiated by the Turin authorities.  The work of such men as Max Frei, belong to this period, and later John Jackson and Eric Jumper.  Most of this investigative work was done in secret.  Maurus Green had attempted unsuccessfuly to construct a history during the 1960s.\nPerre d’Arcis’ assertion that the cloth was a forgery had not been refuted, and the general view was that this revered impression, devotional though it might be, was nevertheless highly suspect. \nIan Wilson highly trained in art history, realised that this perception could never be set aside until some attempt at a credible history prior to the 14th century could at least be postulated.  The results of his attempts to construct such a history are well known.  Prior to the publication of “The Turin Shroud” in 1978, few people had ever heard of the Image of Edessa, the Mandylion, the report of Robert de Clari, or the Hungarian Pray maunscript, let alone the legend of Abgar.  \nIan Wilson’s work changed the public perception of the Shroud, beyond all measure.  From a mere object of pious devotion, the perception grew that maybe, just perhaps, this could well be the burial cloth of Jesus Christ, imprinted with the true face and form of the Redeemer of mankind. \nIt ill behoves smaller minds to denigrate the great contribution that Ian Wilson has brought to the wider public, in its perception of what the Shroud now stands for.  Perhaps Wilson did not get it quite right, but that is no excuse for comparing his monumental work to such charlatans as Dan Green, and other sensationalist wannabes, but neverwillbes. \nIn NZ, we have relatively few pests, some flies, wasps, and there are giant sandflies in our southern regions.  They have it worse in Australia with their venomous snakes  and redback spiders.  In Quebec I’m told, they still have a few foxes, the lynx, and in the north even the occasional polar bear.  It seems they also have gadflies, insects of no use to mankind whatsoever, who annoy and fasten on the butts of nobler animals.  Socrates prided hmself in his arraignment on being such a gadfly on the state of Athens, but Yannick Clement is no Socrates!\n\n","date":"August 27, 2012 at 1:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/23/scholarly-incompetence-or-dishonesty/","cat":"history","title":"Scholarly Incompetence or Dishonesty?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick: Whether the Shroud is or is not the Mandylion, is not the issue.

They were Dom Maurus Green, Dr David Willis, and Ian Wilson.  There were no others.  Green is on record as being open to Wilson’s early ideas on the history of the Shroud.  In 1969, the Cardinal of Turin had appointed a Commission, all Italians from his own Piedmont area.  By 1973, he had included the Belgian, Professor Gilbert Raes, and subsequently the Swiss Max Frei,  It was not until 1978, that the STURP team was established, and included American scientists, such as Jackson and Jumper.  BUT It was not the STURP members who made the impact with the public, that changed the public perception of the importance of the Shroud.

It was the cotton contamination which had suggested to me that the weave was of Syrian provenance, but since then it became evident that there was in fact a medieval trade in cotton to Europe, possibly as early as the 12th century, could even be earlier.

This may be due to some historic stretching and shrinking, or even some weaving practice such as selvedging, trimming, loom margins etc.  \nIt has been suggested that the cloth may have been intended for a special purpose such as a temple garment (van der Hoeven in 2011), which could explain why a Royal cubit may have been used.   \nAt this stage, I feel the issue needs looking at in a little more depth than we’ve managed to do just by blogging.

Biblical Archeological Review (BAR), vol 12 n. 4, 1986, pp.23-24)  A problem with lack of peer-review, but at face value, might be considered indicative.  Needs corroboration.  The title is a misnomer, in that the paper seeks to corroborate that the TS man made contact with limestone dust identical with that found in Jerusalem.  \n3)  Gabriel has sometimes mentioned that strontium studies could be of considerable value, I think in terms of percentages present, which could assist in location provenance, not sure about whether radioactive decay of Sr can be used or not for purposes of dating.  We have sometimes discussed this topic.  \n4) Roger’s work on vanillin may be useful for dating, but seems temperature dependent, and the cloth has been subject to sporadic high temperatures from fires.  Rogers also, I understand, considered that the flax for the linen was processed in accordance with a description by Pliny the elder – Yannick may be able to comment on this aspect. \n5)  Superficiality of the image is a distinctive feature – often suggested that it is confined to a starch(?) coating, rather than the cellulose of the fibrils.  Yannick Clement has often commented on the need to have a much better understanding of the chromophore. \n6)  The geometric distortion of the image is minimal – it seems to conform to an orthogonal projection, such as a photograph might, no lateral stretching, and no side views of the body are visible.  This implies constraints on the disposition of the cloth, whether it was merely draped as many think, or whether it was fully wrapped and tied as Max Patrick Hamon has claimed.  I think it may also have implications for the image formation process.  I personally find it difficult to imagine how a chemical process might produce such an orthogonal image.

They contain a high proportion of the metal being soldered and lead is not used in these alloys. These solders vary in hardness, designated as “enameling”, “hard”, “medium” and “easy”. Enameling solder has a high melting point, close to that of the material itself, to prevent the joint desoldering during firing in the enameling process. ”  \nFrom a very comprehensive Ency Brit article on “Metalworking”: —\nFrom Inlaying: … …\n“Niello is the process of inlaying engraved ornamental designs with niello, a silver sulfide or mixture of sulfides. The first authors to write on the preparation of niello and its application to silver were Eraclius and Theophilus, in or about the 12th century, and Benvenuto Cellini, during the 16th. According to each of these authors, niello is made by fusing together silver, copper, and lead and then mixing the molten alloy with sulfur. The black product (a mixture of the sulfides of silver, copper, and lead) is powdered; and after the engraved metal, usually silver, has been moistened with a flux (a substance used to promote fusion), some of the powder is spread on it and the metal strongly heated; the niello melts and runs into the engraved channels. The excess niello is removed by scraping until the filled channels are visible, and finally the surface is polished.” \nFrom section on Lead:\n” … In the 12th century the German monk Theophilus, in his treatise on metalworking, refers to lead only in connection with casting rods for stained-glass windows and as a material through which silver sheets might be hammered; … Lead could even be useful, in the proper disguise, to simulate rich ecclesiastical objects, for not all religious institutions were wealthy: a group of 14th-century caskets covered with lead tracery, gilded to look like precious metal, have survived in church treasuries. These were used as reliquaries, but some were originally made for secular purposes.”  \n“The Renaissance passion for collecting bronze medals and plaquettes led to a demand for cheap replicas, and these were made with great precision in lead. The metal also played an important role in the goldsmiths’ trade. The fashion for elaborate relief ornament of the Renaissance and Mannerist periods called for a degree of skill in modelling that was beyond the powers of the average goldsmith. The practice therefore grew up for the pattern makers of Augsburg and Nürnberg, Germany, to sell lead models of ornamental details and figures from which goldsmiths working elsewhere could in turn make molds.” \nSo fundamentally, it would be good to know something about the casket commissioned by Margaret of Austria in 1509.  Where was it made?  Who made it? How was it made?  What did it look like? What was its shape and how large was it? \nWas it made from silver sheets fastened together, perhaps by rivets or soldering?  Or else from a single sheet hammered into shape and sealed with soldering?  Or was it cast as one piece by say the lost-wax method?  What ornamentation did it have? Could this have included niello work, or something similar? Could lead models have been used for the purpose of ornamental molds? \nIn brief, it is unlikely that lead was alloyed with the parent silver for the casket, and doubtful that it would be used for any soldering purposes if made from sheets.  However lead might have been present, either as minor contamination from the methods used, or else significantly present in any niello-like work, or other similar ornamentation.\n\n","date":"December 8, 2015 at 2:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/ssg-member-wants-to-know/","cat":"history","title":"SSG Member Wants to Know"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It has become fashionable in some circles to dismiss the Vignon markings as a “joke” and to parody them as for example on Davor Aslanovski’s site.  Possibly Stephen Jones follows Ian Wilson’s text a little too slavishly,  But he makes the point that Vignon originally identified 20 such markings, Wilson reduced these to 15, but Jones also mentions that some enthusiasts claimed to have identified 60.  Whatever, 15 correspondences are too many to dismiss so lightly.  \nPrior to the 6th C, there were considerable variances in the very few portraits of Christ now available, one such portraying him as a beardless Apollo.  Augustine asserted that nobody knew what Jesus looked like, but suddenly in the sixth century, the iconography seems to have become fairly standardised.  It has to be apparent to any fair-minded judgment that whatever template was used for these depictions, there must have been a select few who had access to the Shroud facial image, and these various markings were included in that template.  This is not to make a case that the template was wholly based on the Images of the Shroud or the Edessa nor that the Edesssa was necessarily the Shroud as asserted by Wilson, but it is interesting that much of the iconography seems to have radiated out from Edessa.  Perhaps there were other images available at the time or earlier copies which contributed to the template.  \nJones makes a telling point when he comments:\n“An interesting argument is that in the law courts (where proof `beyond reasonable doubt’ is required), cases of plagiarism or breach of copyright will be settled in the plaintiff’s favour if it can be shown that the text (or whatever) is supposed to have been copied contains errors present in the original. Similarly, in tracing the texts of ancient authors, the best evidence that two versions are copies one from another or from the same original is when both contain the same errors. A charming example is an intrusive colon within a phrase in two fourteenth-century texts of Euripides: one colon turned out to be a scrap of straw embedded in the paper, proving that the other text was a later copy.” [Patterson, C., 1999, “Evolution,” Cornell University Press: Ithaca NY, Second edition, p.117]. \nIf a scrap of straw can be accepted as evidence of copying Euripedes, then 15 Vignon markings on 6th century icongraphy has to be even more compelling that the Shroud facial image was certainly known at that time!\n\n","date":"September 22, 2012 at 4:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is Yannick who is confused.

Nowhere in there have I asserted that Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object.  I dare say it is progress that he seems prepared to concede that the iconography was influenced by the Shroud facial image.  But where was it?  He says that there’s no mention of a burial cloth in Edessa prior to the relic’s transfer thence to Constantinople.  He says perhaps it was in Constantinople, but likewise there’s no mention of the burial cloth in Constantinople, and it wasn’t taken there by Helena.  He says perhaps it was in Palestine, Where in Palestine?  It certainly wasn’t in Jerusalem after 70 AD, and it certainly wasn’t in Antioch after 540 AD when the city was destroyed.  Rebuilding work had commenced there shortly beforehand following eathquakes.  Perhaps the Shroud was discovered then, and where’s the nearest other city? Why, Edessa of course!  And where does this 6th icongraphy commence, also Edessa!  \nPerhaps he imagines it was in St Catherine’s monastery in Sinai, or perhaps it was in Armenia, or Georgia – Sorry, no record!   \nIn the fourth century, Athanasius, the Bishop of Alexandria (ca. 328-373), affirmed that a sacred Christ-icon,12 traceable to Jerusalem and the year 68, was then present in Syria:\n“…but two years before Titus and Vespasian sacked the city [i.e Jerusalem], the faithful and disciples of Christ were warned by the Holy Spirit to depart from the city and go to the kingdom of King Agrippa, because at that time Agrippa was a Roman ally. Leaving the city, they went to his regions and carried everything relating to our faith. At that time even the icon with certain other ecclesiastical objects were moved and they today still remain in Syria. I possess this information as handed down to me from my migrating parents and by hereditary right. It is plain and certain why the icon of our holy Lord and Savior came from Judaea to Syria”  Syria must surely mean Antioch.  \nNo record in Edessa?  Consider these lines from the Edessan poem “Hymn of the Pearl”, in a sindonistic context:\n“On a sudden, as I faced it,\nThe garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself.\nI saw it all in my whole self,\nMoreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it,\nFor we were two in distinction\nAnd yet again one in one likeness.\nAnd the image of the King of kings\nWas depicted in full all over it… ” \nNo doubt some Byzantine historian will twist and turn to wring some other meaning from it!\n\n","date":"September 22, 2012 at 7:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/22/stephen-jones-is-up-with-part-10-of-his-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones is up with Part 10 of his critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Dan posted URL to a video by John Jackson a month or two back, demo by Jackson purporting to show folds under raking light.

John’s gospel does not mention what side the chest wound was inflicted, and the cloth itself would convey the impression that it was on the left.  I wonder why the artists showed the correct location of the chest wound on the right, despite the reversal of the arm positions.  Perhaps they were following the Easter hymn “I saw water flowing from the right side of the temple” which seems to be based on Ezekiel 47:1 describing the prophet’s vision of the heavenly temple, and applied it to Christ.  It seems odd that no artist seems to have picked up the logic that any burial shroud showing an image arising from some kind of bodily contact, would naturally mirror reverse the sides.

The most commonly used cubit derived from ancient Egypt about 3000 BC, and my source (Encyclopedia Britannica) says it pervaded the ancient world and survived into medieval times.  But there were several variations in its exact length.  An ordinary cubit is given as 45.7cm.  The royal cubit was 52.4cm and was standardised by a royal master black granite cubit.  Encyc Brit says in some ancient cultures it was as long as 53.1cm.  I tried checking out the Assyrian cubit but the website I wanted was down at the time.  If it’s 55.6cm as you say, then it seems an anomalously long cubit, granted that there seem to have been signficant Assyrian influences in first century Palestine, (Romans seem to have sometimes delegated governorship of Judea to  Assyria – I know this occurred during the inter-regnum of Herod the Great and Archelaus for example)  \nBut it seems to me that tetradiplon does not convey the meaning of length units.  Very likely the cloth was of Assyrian provenance, and so a whole number of Assyrian cubits might well be expected in its dimensions.

Samples: \n“In 1910, local Arabs unearthed, at the traditional site of Antioch’s ancient cathedral,a silver chalice comprised of an unfinished inner cup and a finished outer holder, akin to a reliquary, exquisitely decorated with ten human figures, in two groups of five. Professor William Newbold has noted that only\nin the middle of the first century did two groups of five men each govern the respective Churches of Jerusalem and Antioch and only at such time would a Christian religious object have displayed such a depiction. Dated to the first century and considered genuine by many archeological and scientific\nauthorities, the Great Chalice of Antioch has been called “a most sacred Cup, in all probability the one which once served the Lord and his disciples at the Last Supper, the most precious object in Christian history, legend and tradition”. [p.4]\n“In Syria itself, archeologists have discovered, in fourth-century tombs, amulets and molded figures connected with the life and passion of Christ, including a zigzag lance, the Cup of the Last Supper, and so called “objects from the resurrection of Lazarus”. Were such resurrection objects actually intended to\nrepresent the burial linens of Christ and not those of Lazarus, it could indicate that the lance, the cup, and the Shroud were all copied in Syria during the fourth century. After exhaustively studying the evidence for many years, Professor Gustavus Eisen concluded that these artifacts had, in fact, been modeled upon actual sacred objects that were once kept in seclusion for their safety and were later lost when concealed upon the approach of persecution or war.” [pp 8-9]\n“Hints of a lost Syrian sindonic history are to be found in the legends of the Holy Grail, an object which, in recent years, has been increasingly linked to the Shroud. Some seventy-five years ago, Professor Eisen concluded that the earliest Grail legends attempted to account for the loss of real sacred objects known in fourth-century Syria and that these stories reflected a passionate desire to locate and recover such objects from concealment.” [p.13]\n[daveb]: It would therefore seem that interest in the Grail considerably predates the 12th century, and that they merely reflect an earlier tradition of the loss of the Grail in the 4th century, possibly hidden by the Arian presbyter Theodorus at Antioch in 362AD to conceal them from confiscation under order by the emperor Julian the Apostate. Theodorus would not reveal the hiding places even under torture and eventual martyrdom. The 1910 discovery may in fact be the true cup used at the Last Supper.\n\n","date":"April 3, 2014 at 6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/02/the-holy-grail-found-in-spain/","cat":"history","title":"The Holy Grail Found in Spain?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I could find no examples of the “a” in any pre-Gothic scripts in Marcos’ work cited above.

He claims to have identified reasons why the fragment is a fake, including a comparison with a Coptic version of the Gospel of John.

Roger Bagnall, a renowned papyrologist who directs the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, and who early on deemed the Jesus’ Wife papyrus likely to be genuine, said in an interview about the skeptics, “Most of the people taking this view wanted it to be a fake, and they haven’t asked critical questions about their own hypothesis.” ” \nDr Karen King has never asserted that the fragment is any kind of evidence that Jesus was married, but this is a line that much sensationalist reporting has attempted to represent.  If the fragment was ever to turn out to be authentic, it would only indicate that its source group was probably caught up in a debate as to the merits of celibacy vs marriage, and someone favouring marriage had attempted to resolve it by falsely asserting that Jesus was married. \nDr Askeland’s assertions come within weeks after Harvard had obtained the results of scientific testing which indicated that the fragment might well be genuine, dating to the 6th to 9th centuries.

Herbert Thurston was a Jesuit scholar, and was assisted in his research by Canon Ulysse Chevalier.  These two gentlemen seemed to have had an agenda of mythologising traditional beliefs, following a Germanic trend, whereas the photographs were strong evidence that the gospel records were reasonably factual.  They produced a paper creating the impression that the draft of Bishop Pierre D’Arcis he originally intended to send to anti-Pope Clement VII at Avignon had in fact been dispatched.  D’Arcis had his own financial problems to repair his cathedral and was put out that pilgrims were diverted by the Shroud exhibitions at Lirey. Also he may well have been confused by reports that the Shroud had in fact been copied, notably to replace its being taken from Bensancon. Clement VII ordered D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under threat of excommunication. \nThe dishonesty of the two clerics in their massaging the evidence in this affair, Thurston and Chevalier, is set out in a paper: “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD”; By Jack Markwardt; 2001.\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf\nIt is a fascinating read.\n\n","date":"April 17, 2014 at 7:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/10/21/the-ridiculous-picknett-and-prince-photograph-theory/","cat":"history","title":"The Ridiculous Picknett and Prince Photograph Theory"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"One plausible explanation might be Constantine Porphyrogenitus’ wet nurse.

The exact 4:1 aspect ratio of the TS, is suggestive of it being cut with its resewn selvedge to exact dimensions. Cubit measures varied widely between civilizations, one civilization may have used two or even three different cubits for different purposes, and there is also some confusion in the literature. Unless granite master standards are available (as in Egypt), the local cubit must be determined from measurements of buildings and monuments. Original Egyptian cubit was 457mm; Royal Egyptian cubit was 524mm; Some civilzations used a cubit of up to 560mm. \nCubit of the Assyrians derives from their conquest of Babylon 1350 – 612 BCE. Flinders Petrie & Jules Oppert, 19th c. pioneer archaeologists made numerous measurements of Babylonian buildings; Petrie wrote extensively on the several cubits in use (even including Stonehenge). The Petrie-Oppert Assyrian cubit is 546mm (+/- 5mm). Eleanor Guralnick 1996 measured several Sargonid slabs & monuments 721-705 BCE; Guralnick – standard late cubit 515mm, religious-royal cubit 566mm, King Sargon slab 550mm. \nMeasurement of TS is commonly taken as 4.34m x 1.09m, and is therefore consistent with the Petrie-Oppert Assyrian cubit. \nNearly all Egyptian thread is ‘S’ twist, and so TS is unlikely to be of Egyptian provenance. ‘Z’ twist does occur elsewhere in Middle East, despite comments by CF. Various cloth fragments of the sealed tomb of diseased family at Akeldama included both ‘S’ & ‘Z’; At Murraba’at, Grace & Elizabeth Crowfoot recorded seven twill-weave fabrics including herringbone twills with ‘Z’ spun warp and mixed ‘S’ & ‘Z’ spun weft, possibly imported. ‘Z’ spin seems to have predominated in northern Europe.\nMethchild Flury-Lemburg on examining the stitching of the TS resewn edge commented that she had only ever previously seen that stitch used at Masada and nowhere else. \nIt is also perhaps significant that only in the Raes corner (resewn?)is there any evidence of cotton, therefore TS is hardly likely to be medieval.\nNone of the above provides irrevocable proof that the TS is of ancient Assyrian provenance. However it is fatuous to assert in the face of the above that there is any conclusive proof that it is not.

Essentially David Roberts is creating a story based on an extremely rare Greek word, in fact the only place it can be found is in Tim 4:13. English transliteration is “phailonen”, and you won’t find it in your on-line Greek lexicons.  Now try an English-Greek lexicon, look up “cloak”, you’ll get about 46 entries, including “phainole” and interestingly, “mandua” (check mantle, mandylion?).  Jerome tranlsates phailonen as Latin “paenulam” =  a woolen cloak, and translators after him have followed this lead. \nHugh’s ref on “Paul’s cloak” makes some very relevant comments. The full text of Tim 4:13 tells Timothy to bring with him the cloak(??) that Paul left with Carpus, along with the books, but especially the parchments. One interpretation is that the phailonen may have been some kind of carrying case (book jacket?) for the literature. Paul would have had easy access to obtaiing a cloak for himself in Rome; alternatively if a cloak is indeed meant, maybe he intended Timothy to use it on the jouorney as winter was approaching. \nI think it verges on the preposterous to suggest as the video does,that Paul was toting the Turin Shroud around with him as a visual aid to convert the pagans, and he wouldn’t be leaving it with some mate in Troy.

In the fourth gospel, “the disciple that Jesus loved” is more usually identified with the writer of that gospel, and there seems to be a strong tradition that this was a son of Zebedee, a fisherman, not a temple secretary.  This “loved disciple” is the one who hesitates to enter the tomb, but is then supposed to recognize his temple garment. Augustine of course has a different take on “and then he believed (the women)”.  \nHowever, I think Hoeven makes a credible case for it being a temple garment. In view of Max’s comment, is it possible that it was actually Joseph’s temple garment? It was actually Gamaliel II in the 2nd century who insisted on being buried in a plain weave linen cloth, to counteract the then Jewish trend for extravagant and costly funerals, and the requirement for plain weave shrouds dates from this example.

The properties of the Turin Shroud for its identification as a garment, even a priest‟s garment, are its Pharisaic enlarged border and cut off corners (and fringes), its apparel weave, the threads‟ possibly sacerdotal Z-twist, and its images of a priest‟s oval ornament and seal with its cord. The most outstanding biblical fact that identifies Jesus‟ shroud as a priest‟s garment is the beloved disciple‟s belief that Jesus had risen because he saw the shroud rolled up and placed aside (John 20:7-8), just as a priest‟s garment was always rolled up and placed aside in the temple.

In order to fulfil this commandment in a meticulous and Pharisaic way, even for his all-white linen temple garment, Mark probably applied a margin to his mantle by making a long seam a few centimeters from one of its long edges, and made a hole in the corners of this margin, to which a blue cord could be fastened (for out-of-temple situations, such as in the House of Caiphas in the Upper City and perhaps also Caiphas‟ office palace in Antonia) or loosened (for in-temple situations, especially for when in the Chamber of Hewn Stones in the Court of the Israelites).” \nPage 5, para 4: “Now, in order to remain a secret disciple he had to prevent anyone from recognizing the rolled up burial shroud as his temple sindōn. It would be sufficient to cut off the margin along the ornamental seam, for then this seam would look like an ordinary functional hem, applied to prevent the edge from loosening, and not like the unique ornamental seam of his „talith‟. And he did not have to cut off the margin for the complete length of the cloth, for the seam was only visible in the last and next to last layer of the roll, formed by the ends of the cloth when it is doubled in the middle and rolled up from the fold.

Likewise Bart Ehrman’s “Did Jesus Exist?” is also a powerful work and provides strong evidence for the historical existence of Jesus as a person.  Ehrman’s personal reaction against his evangelical background towards agnosticism, may only serve to underscore the significance of his insistence on the real historical existence of Jesus, supported by his considerable reputation as a NT scholar, as well as his non-biblical references.  J P Meier’s “Marginal Jew” has the advantage of a minimalist approach to the question, and therefore leaves no question as to the value of his conclusion. \nCiting the late first-century dates of NT composition is a weak argument against their authenticity, and under-rates the value and strength of oral tradition in pre-literate societies.

Plain weaves for burial cloth purposes, only became fashionable for the well-to-do in the 2nd century when Gamaliel II set such an example, to discourage a previous extravagance in funerary attire, which up till then seems to have been a fairly normal type of practice.\n\n","date":"July 26, 2013 at 5:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/25/what-did-wilson-andor-flury-lemberg-actually-observe-about-stitching/","cat":"history","title":"What did Wilson and/or Flury-Lemberg actually observe about stitching?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Shroud was sent south to the monastery of Montevergine at Avellino on the outbreak of hostilities as early as September 1939.

The one true scientist he mentions in his catalogue of scholars, Galileo, had nothing to say on the Shroud that is recorded.

Galileo’s error was essentially an error of political judgement.  He had won acclaim from fellow scientists, church, popes and cardinals for his discoveries.  His casting of Simplicio as the protagonist of the Ptolemaic system was widely seen as an ungrateful lampooning of his former patron Pope Urban VIII.  The Dominican inquisitors with their commitment to Thomistic philosophy had a vested interest in presenting newly discovered works of Aristotle, which were contradicted by the new physics.

Included in the paper is an indication that the so-called Image of Edessa may well have had a part in the conversion of Abgar the Great. In summary: \n1) A 6th c. entry in the Liber Pontificalis records that Pope Eleutherius (174-189) received a letter from ‘British king Lucius’ (Britannio rege Lucio) asking that he might be made a Christian through his agency. Venerable Bede in 731 repeats this account, and that the king’s baptism was soon effected. However, Britain in the 2nd century was under Roman rule and had no king.  \n2) In 1904, Adolph Harnack deduced that the entry was not intended to refer to Britain, but to the ‘Britio Edessenorum’, Edessa’s citadel, and not to King Lucius, but to King Lucius Ælius Septimius Megas Abgarus VIII of Edessa, otherwise known as Abgar the Great. \n3) Abgar’s letter to Eleutherius could only have been sent with his most trusted confidantes, his ‘pasgriba’ and father-in-law Ma’nu, and his wife (Ma’nu’s daughter) Queen Shalmath. \n4) There is only one documented late 2nd c. ecclesiastical journey which begins in Rome and ends in Mesopotamia, that by Avercius Marcellus, bishop of Hieropolis (180-200), recorded on his epitaph and repeated in two other accounts. \n5) Avercius recounts that he is a disciple of a holy shepherd who feeds flocks of sheep on mountains and on plains, “And to Rome he sent me to contemplate majesty, and to see a queen golden-robed and golden-sandaled; there also I saw a people bearing a shining mark.” The reference to a queen would seem to imply Queen Shalmath. \n6) On departing Rome, Avercius writes: ““And I saw the land of Syria and all its cities, Nisibis I saw when I passed over Euphrates”. He would have travelled on the Silk Road, through Edessa and Antioch. The glaring omission of both these cities in the narrative may suggest that something historic, but too dangerous to acknowledge, may well have occurred there. \n7) Avercius also seems to write: ““But everywhere I had brethren. I had Paul.” The Doctrine of Addai records that a Christian named Palut serves as an aide to the missionary Addai, and on his death assumes leadership of the Edessan Church. A cleric named Palut was appointed by Bishop Serapion of Antioch in 198 to establish orthodox Christianity in Edessa, and in 200 was ordained first bishop of Edessa. \n8) Avercius writes further: “Faith everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands from a fountain and this it ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread.” A “fish of exceeding great size” could hardly refer to the eucharist (more usually rendered as a small fish held in both hands, and also separately mentioned by the reference to bread and wine).  \n9) The reference to the ‘great fish’ might well indicate that Avercius was entrusted with temporary custody of the Shroud as part of his missionary kit to Edessa, and may explain the inclusion of the the portrait in the Abgar story.\nAs I have explained at #6, the account of the conversion of Abgar and Edessa was too dangerous to set down in its literal form, but was written up as an analogy. Only the names were changed, to protect the guilty!\n\n","date":"January 6, 2014 at 5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think I can agree with most of what O.K. has written above. I cannot recall a single paper contributing to our understanding of the TS that was ever written by a scholar with “no interest whatsoever in the Shroud”. In fact such an inference would be self-contradictory. \nIt is evident that the phantom of Yannick continues to misunderstand such issues, as did his more corporeal predecessor. \nWhat does it mean to say that a document, such as the Doctrine of Addai, is unauthentic?  Clearly it was written by some person of influence living in Edessa, with an interest in that city, and with a deliberate purpose in mind, apparently in an attempt to explain how Christianity came there, and as Eusebius mentions included in the Edessa archives. As such it is pseudonymous, a common enough practice for good reasons, as even Yannick’s current hero, Dale Martin mentions in his video. It was not written by some random individual from Babylon for no purpose whatsoever. \nIt is a serious mistake, as Markwardt shows, to take the story at its face value, as a letter from Agbar Ukkama to Jesus, and that Jesus provided a written response, and then claim that the story therefore has no significance. However, those brought up on a diet of literalism, will never understand such a distinction. The tradition of the “disciplina arcana” was never accepted nor understood by the 15th century Protestant reformers, determined to claim a strict literalism in the scriptures, and this outlook has permeated and persists in much of ordinary secular scholarship even yet. \nYannick and the army of scholarly detractors, will never be able to penetrate the meaning of the Abgar legend, so long as they continue their narrow focus on a literal interpretation of the text. The Doctrine of Addai is pseudonymous, not only in its authorship, but also in its caste of characters, as Markwardt has effectively shown with a most credible explanation of its actual meaning.

Eusebius gives a version of the story in 325AD, which he claimed to have obtained from the Edessa archives, but asserts it as a forgery. He does not mention the portrait, most likely because he is something of an iconoclast. \nJack Markwardt offers to my mind a very credible explanation. He notes that it was unlikely to have been written in the 1st century as it would then make Edessa so apostolically pre-eminent that it would never have subordinated itself in 200AD to the Church in Antioch. \nMarkwardt postulates that it was written at the behest of Abgar the Great to mark the city’s conversion to Christianity. It was written as an allegory out of caution. A papal mission to Edessa could only have occurred during the reign of the tolerant emperor Commodus between 180AD and 193AD. An Edessan coin during this period shows Abgar the Great with a cross on his tiara, and also the emperor Commodus. In 194AD the succeeding emperor Septimus Severus took Abgar’s rule from him for supporting Parthia against Rome, but he was retored to favour in 198AD. On the accession of the less tolerant Severus, Abgar neutralised the Christian imagery of his coinage. \nPope Eleutherius would only have dispatched a mission to Edessa during the period 180AD to 189AD. Abgar would not have accepted baptism after 193AD. In 201AD, Severus banned conversions to Christianity. The dilemma of recording the significant event of the city’s conversion was overcome by invoking the “disciplina arcana” and writing it up as an analogy (parables again!). \nThus in the Abgar legend, we can make the following substitutions: Abgar the Great seeking redemption becomes Abgar Ukkama a first century monarch seeking a cure; Abgar’s letter to Pope Eleutherius becomes his distant predecessor’s correspondence to Jesus; Ma’nu the royal emissary to Eleutherius becomes Hanan the 1st century archivist as emissary to Jesus; Eleutherius who authorises a papal mission becomes Jesus approving a posthumous apostolic mission; Bishop Avircius the papal missionary becomes Addai Christ’s emissary; Palut, Avircius’ companion and future bishop of Edessa, becomes Aggai, Addai’s principal aide. \nThere is much more to it.

Certainly there was some venerated cloth object in Edessa, very likely with an image, and generally known as the Image of Edessa, or Mandylion, and quite conceivably it may have been the Shroud, but showing only the facial image.\n\n","date":"January 6, 2014 at 7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I love this paper by Kim Dreisbach, and have referred to it from time to time.\nMozarabic proper refers to those Christians who lived under Moslem domination in Spain.  However the so-called Mozarabic rite (more accurately Old Hispanic) was well developed even before the Visigoth period, its final form being determined by St Isidore of Seville, (d.636) before the Muslim invasion.   \nThe reference to ‘vestigia’ corresponds to the scripture text John 20:6-8.  None of the four Greek texts from the parallel Greek web-site, nor Jerome’s Vulgate text, refer to the imprints on the cloths.  It would seem to be an early inference taken from the text of v.8: “8 Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed.”  It raises the question of what was it that he saw that made him believe. \nDreisbach quotes a few other interesting early liturgical sources, which I’ve recently mentioned to a few other Eucharistic Ministers at my local church.  The EMs are required to spread a corporal cloth on the altar before Mass on which the sacred elements are placed.\nKim observes: \nAs early as A.D. 325, Pope Sylvester I established:\n‘that Mass be celebrated on an altar covered with a cloth of linen consecrated by the\nBishop, as if it were the clean Shroud of Christ.’\nTheodore of Mopsuestia (ca. A.D. 350-428) expresses this motif’s incorporation into the liturgy, describing the role of the deacons in the liturgy as follows:\n‘When they bring up (the oblation at the offertory) they place it on the altar for the\ncompleted representation of the passion so that we may think of Him on the altar as if He\nwere placed in the sepulchre after having received the passion … the deacons who spread\nthe linens on the altar represent the figure of the linen cloths at the burial….’  \nThere are also some fascinating comparisons with the burial and resuscitation of Lazarus.

They then measured his cloth-body distance (normal or vertical??) and obtained an exact match with micro-densitometer readings on a true Shroud negative.  I am under the impression that that is the fundamental experimental basis for asserting that the luminance provides an accurate 3-D height-map for the image.  I imagine that more rigorous experiments may have been carried out since then with better equipment.  However to obtain a true contour map, I should think that it would be necessary to add the height of the draped cloth at its various points, to the z coordinate.  Although J & J seemed to think that there “was only one true way” of draping the cloth, clearly there’s some scope for variation in the height of the cloth.  The bronze statue cast by sculptor Luigi E Mattei at the Pontifical Institute of Notre Dame of Jerusalem centre and shown on this site recently seems fairly persuasive evidence, even allowing for some artisitic licence.  .  \n(2) As Gabriel hints at above, the fact that there is this correlation between cloth-body distance and luminance, must say something about the image-forming process.  I am thinking that if it is a chemical process for instance, then the gas(?) molecules as they are emitted from the body are perhaps inherently unstable, and in the time they take to arrive at the cloth are partly converted to their stable form with various concentrations depending on the distance they’ve traveled, resulting in the different intensities of luminance, and the consequential correlation with cloth-body distance.  Does this make sense?\n\n","date":"February 2, 2013 at 3:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/02/teaser-of-the-day-3-why-many-state-that-the-shroud-is-a-3d-image/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","title":"Teaser of the Day (#3): Why many state that the Shroud is a 3D image"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin has again got it only partially right.

Barbet was a French surgeon who studied the photographs of the Shroud in great detail.  In addition he seems to have been a competent Latin & Greek scholar, and draws on several ancient works which describe the usual practices.  Furthermore he had access to the distressing reports of witnesses to crucifixion experiments carried out under the Nazi regime in the Dachau death camps.  His original work was published in French in 1950 under the title “La Passion de N.S. Jesus Christ selon le Chirurgien” by Dillon & Cie.  It was translated into English by “The Earl of Wicklow” under its own title.  The edition I have access to was published in paperback by Image Books, New York 1963. \nThe usual practice after scourging was for the condemned person to carry (not drag) the ~120 lb patibulum (cross-beam) to the place of execution where the upright (stipes) was permanently set in place.  Barbet estimates the stipes at not much more than 2.5 m high, based on the fact that an unmounted infantryman would sometimes dispatch the victim with a spear to the heart.  (This might be an underestimate by Barbet as it seems that the ~2m lancea was used which would allow some further height).  In Jesus’ case the carrying of the patibulum was assisted by Simon of Cyrene.  It was usual for the victim’s arm to be bound to the patibulum during this portage. \nBarbet’s sources suggest to him that nailing was the more usual practice rather than binding for fastening the victim to the cross, although in one particular region (not Palestine) binding was more usual.  The victim would lie on the ground and his “arms” (not his hands) would be stretched out along the line of the patibulum and be nailed to it.  It would then be an easy task for four soldiers to raise the patibulum with the victim attached (say 220 lbs) and fasten it to the stipes, either as a T (Tau) or t, depending on whether the stipes was notched or end-bearing.  The body would sag under its own weight, and the feet would then be nailed. Sometimes a foot pedestal would be provided, allowing the victim to exercise a see-saw motion allowing him some breathing, but this would prolong the agony. \nThe blood flows from the wrists would follow gravity, and thus Barbet measures the angle of the arms at between 65 and 70 degrees to the horizontal, quite a steep angle.  \nBarbet also deals with the apparent lengthening of the arms on the Shroud image.  He discounts joint dislocation as a cause of this, as dislocation usually results in a shortening of the arms due to muscle contraction (Ask anyone who’s had a dislocated shoulder).  The humerus can however be separated from the shoulder blade a little if it is violently stretched.  Barbet says that the maximum stretch is only 2 inches, and this conforms with the triangulation commencing with the arm stretched out horizontal and then lowered to 65 degrees from body sag.  \nI feel that this account may be inadequate to explain the apparent lengthening of the arms that we see on the Shroud image.  My own view of this is that it will depend very much on the disposition of the cloth when the image was formed, its folds, creases etc, and I see this as a problem in projective geometry, which I have endeavoured to raise on this site from time to time.  If the cloth lay at some angle to the quasi-plane of the arms, then the projection of the arms on to the cloth will appear to be lengthened. \nRegarding Paul’s point that he had read that the hands cannot reach the genital area as shown on the Shroud:  This is only true if the legs are straight out.  Rigor mortis would hold the knees bent, and this is shown on 3-D imaging on the thierrycastex.blogspot.fr site.  The genital area is then easily reached.\n\n","date":"September 5, 2012 at 11:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/a-different-approach-to-what-some-see-as-problems-with-the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A different approach to what some see as problems with the image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Further to my comment #2 above, Sep 5, 11:42pm, and ensuing discussion:\nI went back to Barbet to check out some of his technical details more carefully.  Interestingly, I discovered that in his youth, Barbet had been a sapper, working on railway construction, and was familiar with men carrying railway sleepers (cross-ties) on their shoulders, and occasionally tripping during this.  This relates to the carrying of the patibulum which he estimates at 120 lb.  He postulates that Jesus was not bound to the patibulum, but carried it on his right shoulder in much the same way, and then was easily assisted by Simon of Cyrene.  He has an interesting discussion on injuries to his back and knees during his falls.\nHe considers that the full cross was Tau shaped T, and was not more than about 6ft 8 in in height.  After being nailed to the patibulum with arms fully outstretched while lying horizontal, a ladder would be placed against the stipes, which the victim would then mount with his back to the stipes, while four soldiers would then easily lift the patibulum with the victim attached and place it on the top of the stipes.  Weight of the patibulum and the body would not be more than 286 lb, so he is estimating the body weight as 166 lb. \nFrom the blood flows he measures that the arms in the crucified position are 65 degrees to the vertical, which is 25 deg to the horizontal.  He considers that the normal distance between shoulder blade and wrist is slightly less than 24 inches.  In the suspended position, this gives a hypoteneuse of 24 / cos 25 = 26.48 inches, giving a lengthening of the arm of about 2.46 inches.  This is close to his maximum limit of 2 inches from ligament stretch.  \nFrom the triangle of forces, it can be calculated that the tension in each arm must be:\nT = 166 / (2 x sin 25) = 196 lbs, a fairly traumatic tension to hold for 3 hours.  Severe cramps would rapidly ensue, together with the issues of asphyxiation and other trauma.  Whether this tension would be sufficient to cause eventual shoulder dislocation, I am unable to say, but Barbet apparently discounts it.  If the image is considered by some to show shoulder dislocation, as has been commented, this may have resulted from repositioning of the arms in a state of rigor mortis during the eventual laying out. \nI am still holding to the view that the apparent lengthening of the arms on the image may be a matter of projective geometry, involving the angles between the cloth and arms during image formation.  This may be an issue that needs further consideration.\n\n","date":"September 7, 2012 at 5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/a-different-approach-to-what-some-see-as-problems-with-the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A different approach to what some see as problems with the image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Further to my arm tension calc above.  It’s essentially based on elementary equilibrium statics.  The 196 lb tension in each arm provides a vertical component of 83 lbs each countering half the weight of the body.  This 196 lb is near the maximum tension in the arm.  The victim would engage a seesaw sort of action to maintain breathing as long as he was able, transferring some of his weight to his nailed feet, thus momentarily relieving some of the arm tension.\nThe 196 lb arm tension has a 178 lb horizontal component, maintaining his sideways equilibrium, and at the nails should transfer a net compression of 178 lb along the beam of the patibulum.  (Timber stresses are tricky to assess accurately because of the grain)\nI don’t know the particular art work Max mentions or how it might relate to crucifixion trauma.  However I believe I have read that the two shoulders on the TS do show some significant difference, various ones suggesting that it might have been occupationally incurred, such as frequently working with heavy timbers.  I am not sure about shoulder damage during his falls without rechecking in Barbet.  If I find anything, I may comment again.\n\n","date":"September 8, 2012 at 11:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/a-different-approach-to-what-some-see-as-problems-with-the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A different approach to what some see as problems with the image on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I’m trying to get a clear picture in my mind as to your hypothesis on this, but I need it in clear plain language so as to understand it.  From your other postings you’ve placed, I’ve got the idea that you’re saying the Shroud and other cloths have been moistened during a ritual process, and then it is tied up firmly (tightly?), and that then it dries out and this drying loosens it.  Are you maybe saying that the moistening results in it shrinking, that the image process then proceeds, that the Shroud when drying out then returns to its natural size and shape, and this is what gives the impression that the arms are too long.  If that’s the case, then you’d also have to say that the shrinking and stretching is uneven, otherwise the whole image would be affected the same way and we wouldn’t see any distortion at all.

I think he’s on to something there.   \nRon: I’m not aware that other “forensic experts” have claimed that shoulders were dislocated.  Barbet says “No!” on the basis that muscle contraction would in fact shorten the arms. But would muscle contraction operate in a case of rigor mortis? I wouldn’t know. Barbet says you can only get a 2 inch extension from stretching the shoulder ligaments. Otherwise the action of dislocating the shoulders during the laying out of a body seems to me unduly violent, merely to place the hands in that position,  \nNevertheless the arms do appear unusually long.  That is why I suggest it may be a projective geometry property regarding the angle between placing of the arms and the disposition or folds in the cloth at the time of image formation.

Very likely they tie them together at the wrists so they don’t flex out again.  But you could still get some abduction with movement at the shoulders and elbows, as the wrists are not anchored.

You have to be very careful with the nomenclature. Diimide = diazene isn’t diazine and isn’t diamide. \nMy reading of diimide is that it’s used for preparation for certain stable plastics – polyiimides not polyamides.  An Encyc Brit extract if you can make any sense out of it: \n“Polyimides are polymers that usually consist of aromatic rings coupled by imide linkages—that is, linkages in which two carbonyl (CO) groups are attached to the same nitrogen (N) atom. There are two categories of these polymers, condensation and addition. The former are made by step-growth polymerization and are linear in structure; the latter are synthesized by heat-activated addition polymerization of diimides and have a network structure.”  \n“Network polyimides are formed from bismaleimide and bisnadimide precursors. At temperatures above 200° C (390° F), bismaleimides undergo free-radical addition polymerization through the double bonds to form a thermosetting network polymer. Bisnadimides react somewhat differently at elevated temperatures. The nadimide group first decomposes to yield cyclopentadiene and maleimide, which then copolymerize to form the network polyimide structure.”\n“Polyimides are amorphous plastics that characteristically exhibit great temperature stability and high strength, especially in the form of composites. They are used in aircraft components, sporting goods, electronics components, plastic films, and adhesives.”  \nI’d be guessing that Ray Rogers discovered that image discolouration occurred when image fibres were reacted with diimide.\n\n","date":"April 15, 2014 at 7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/15/good-chemistry-questions/","cat":"science","title":"Good Chemistry Questions"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Penrose is one of most brilliant mathematical minds of our present age.  He would know that Godel’s theorems of incompleteness are intended to apply to rigorous logical systems of mathematics, such as those attempted by Russell & Whitehead.  They resolved a puzzle in Cantor’s transfinite numbers as to whether there was a transfinite number between aleph(0) and aleph(1), or whether there was a continuum of such numbers.  In fact it was shown by Godel’s theorems, that the answer is undecidable.  Whether there is in fact a chemistry or physics equivalent to Godel’s theorems I think can only be seen in analogy.  There might be such an answer in the indeterminate questions of quantum mechanics, Heisenberg’s principle of uncertainty, and the quantum pairings of remote particles notwihstanding the limits imposed by speed of light. \nI think I prefer Teilhard de Chardin’s approach to the evolution of consciouness.  Teilhard worked on his theories during the 1920s-30s, but because of the constraints imposed by his Jesuit order they only became available after his death in 1955 with the publication of such works as his ‘Phenomenon of Man’ and ‘The Divine Milieu’.  It is remarkable that fundamentally he foresaw the development of the Internet.  A paleontologist and mystic, rather than a rigorous philosopher, Teilhard’s ideas are too speculative for some tastes, but nevertheless his ideas seem to have a wonderful cohesion.  He sees the breakthrough in consciousness with the development of encephalisation, and nervous tissue, but I suspect his ideas go further back to even the intrinsic nature of matter. \n“Teilhard’s attempts to combine Christian thought with modern science and traditional philosophy aroused widespread interest and controversy when his writings were published in the 1950s. Teilhard aimed at a metaphysic of evolution, holding that it was a process converging toward a final unity that he called the Omega point. He attempted to show that what is of permanent value in traditional philosophical thought can be maintained and even integrated with a modern scientific outlook if one accepts that the tendencies of material things are directed, either wholly or in part, beyond the things themselves toward the production of higher, more complex, more perfectly unified beings.”  Socialisation was another important breakthrough. \n“While some evolutionists regard man simply as a prolongation of the Pliocene fauna—an animal more successful than the rat or the elephant—Teilhard argued that the appearance of man brought an added dimension into the world. This he defines as the birth of reflection: animals know, but man knows that he knows; he has “knowledge to the square.”  ” [Quotations from Encyclopedia Britannica]   \nI see Teilhard’s work as the one worthwhile attampt to synthesise the ideas of science, philosophy and religion.  Unfortunately like most insightful geniuses who attempt to synthesise across disparate disciplines, he was rejected by them for either being insufficiently scientific or insufficiently theological.  A scientist with strong religious views could do worse than to be familiar with his work.\n\n","date":"September 26, 2012 at 9:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/26/how-can-physics-and-chemistry-account-for-consciousness/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"How can physics and chemistry account for consciousness?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I wonder if Ray Rogers ever considered whether some kind of yeast residue might have been a significant agent in a Maillard reaction forming the Shroud image; i.e. bacterial rather than chemical?

(Etc)” Cartographer that he is, this is the way that the projection would work. Any senior high school student in Technical Drawing would immediately know this without even touching his Tee-square.  Max Patrick Hamon does not know this, so he clearly does not have the competence of a Technical Drawing High School student when it comes to 3-dimensional geometry.\nThe only way that a tightly wrapped shroud could produce the orthogonal image as seen is if the sides of the body had been packed (possibly with some of the 100 lb package brought by Nicodemus), hiding the sides, so that the shrouded corpse appears as an approximation to a distorted cuboid, with the frontal and dorsal surfaces of the sheet, following the lines of the body probably mis-shapen in rigor mortis. Transverse sections of the sheet, would need to be almost linear, for an orthogonal image to have any possibility of forming, otherwise the distortion mentioned by YC occurs. However, this is not the configuration claimed by Max Patrick Hamon, and therefore his hypothesis will result in distortion, which is not what we see!  \nI concede that that the various rituals which MPH persistently refers to may have a role in the image formation process, however there is very little experimental evidence he can present to demonstrate that they do so.

Nitowski (Dr. Eugenia Nitowski – Sister Damian of the Cross, OCD) had evidently satisfied herself that she had identified the cloth dust as travertine aragonite limestone, similar to that found at the Gate of Damascus at Jerusalem.  Howver the point, as made by Gabriel, is that it seems that this was as far as it was taken, and her research was never submitted to any kind of peer review, so that her work has not been scientifically corroborated.  \nKohlbeck also mentions that both the Jerusalem and Shroud samples also included traces of strontium and iron but no lead.

I’m inclined to take Gabriel’s point that he may well have been surfing this site picking up various stray blog comments. \n1) He trots out the Bishop D’Arcis memo yet again, which I feel has now been adequately discredited.  The common faulty understanding that this alleged memo was actually completed and delivered to the Avignon Pope now seems to have arisen from a liberal faction within the Church about 1905 partly as a reaction to Secondo Pio’s first negatives which many felt demonstrated the reality of the Resurrection.  The faction preferred a more liberal or psychological interpretation of that reality, and I’ve previously mentioned Jack Markwardt’s claims that those involved set out to defraud by attributing the D’Arcis memo with more significance than it warranted. It’s doubtful that it ever went beyond the draft stage, and likely there were improper motives behind it, or else was based on incorrect information referring to an actual copy made to replace the orginal previously kept at Besancon.\n2) Yes, thousands were crucified by the Romans and various other regimes in ancient times but, assuming the Shroud’s authenticity as a burial cloth for a crucifixion victim, there is I think too much evidence that this particular victim was indeed Jesus Christ. Even the arch-sceptic Herbert Thurston had to agree that if it was not actually Jesus Christ, then it was clearly intended to represent no other. The long hair and beard point to a Jewish victim; the injuries – the scourging, the spear thrust etc are in broad accord with the NT accounts; the cap of thorns seems to have been an impulsive soldier’s action mocking the claim to being “King of the Jews” (the official fundamental charge) – it was never a standard crucifixion punishment.  Most persuasive for me is that here we have a burial cloth showing the image of an uncorrupted body, and yet there is in fact no body to go with the cloth. \n3) Concerning the forensics: As Pierre Barbet has convincingly demonstrated, all of the blood flows (including those on the arms) are in full accord with those of a crucifixion victim, well beyond the competence and understanding of any medieval forger. A “Ho hum” comment is an inadequate response to such evidence.  \n4) Too perfect an image: Not strictly correct! The wrist-nailing is at variance with medieval understanding of how Christ was nailed to the cross, but is in fact more rational. There are slight deformities in the image from various causes such as wrinkling of the cloth, and although the image appears to be an orthogonal projection, there are slight variations from this, possibly because of how the cloth was draped or wrapped over/around the body, or perhaps arising from the actual imaging process.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2013 at 6:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/04/a-mysterious-work-of-art/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A mysterious work of art?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"CSB: “I emphatically do not make ad hominen attacks on the individuals themselves.

The sciences in general have frequently been contentious.  I can recommend any of Hal Hellman’s books in his series “Great Feuds in …” (Science / Mathematics / Technology / Medicine).  The feuds were sometimes about priority, sometimes about validity, sometimes about concepts. \nTwo matters come to mind in connection with this challenge and the debate about consensus.  \nAround 1900, David Hilbert, president of a prestigious international mathematical association presented a programme of some 23 unsolved problems for the twentieth century.  I think most of them have now all been resolved, a few in quite unexpected ways, e.g. Godel’s undecidability theorem, axiom of choice, and the contiuum hypothesis in transfinite numbers.  Hilbert had not sought consensus for his programme, but his status as president had allowed him alone  to formulate his programme of challenges. \nThe second matter relates to the Paul Wolfskehl prize of 100,000 marks for the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem   Fermat had formulated his notorious theorem around 1637, and claimed to have had a proof (he hadn’t – it was really a hypothesis).  The problem challenged the best mathematicians for the next few hundred years.  In 1908, Paul Wolfskehl, a Gernan industrialist bequeathed in his will a prize of 100,000 GM to whomever could solve it.  The challenge attracted every amateur mathematician throughout the world, and the math dept in the university of Gottingen was inundated with attempted proofs. In response the dean developed a routine card response “The first error occurs in Line xxx”.\nThe Theorem was finally proved by the English mathematician Andrew Wiles at Princeton U in 1995, who had dedicated much of his professional life to its solution.  Peer review of his first presentation of the “proof” revealed.a serious problem which seemed intractable.  However further work resolved his difficulty, and Wiles eventually collected the prize. \nYou can find any amount of material on the web about Fermat’s Last Theorem, the Wolfskehl prize and Wiles’ proof of the theorem.  Simon Singh has published an excellent paper-back on the subject. \nThe example serves to illustrate.how acceptance in the scientific community comes about, certainly in mathematics anyway.  I doubt if the Shroud challenge will attract the same amount of attention as did the Wolfskehl prize.

The only positive results were seen for the presence of aldehydes and cellulosic carboxyl functional groups. These results argue against the body images being the result of painting with some type of applied stain or dye, but suggest instead that the image was produced by some type of chemical process yielding a dehydrative oxidation of the cellulosic structure of the linen itself. Note this is consistent with the corroded surface appearance as seen in phase contrast and the brittleness of the body image fibers as observed in the microscope studies. Thus the chromophore accounting for the body image fiber color would be a mixture of conjugated carbonyl structures generated within the cellulose polymer itself.9, 24 It should be noted that this type of chemistry accounts for the natural yellowing of linen as it ages. Therefore the body image chemistry can be thought of as some type of selective differential accelerated aging process. No one as yet has experimentally demonstrated a chemical mechanism that would yield this type of chromophore and at the same time be consistent with the observed physical properties of the image.33”  \nThus he dismisses the coating hypothesis of Rogers, and attributes the image thus “… body image fiber color would be a mixture of conjugated carbonyl structures generated within the cellulose polymer itself”\n\n","date":"July 19, 2015 at 5:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/16/a-reason-to-doubt-the-image-was-formed-by-radiation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Reason to Doubt the Image Was Formed By Radiation"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh, you have a lot of variables to explore; e.g. the TSM shows no sign of decay, maybe you left it too long; did you try it with different temperature and humidity levels?

As a food chemist, Colin would know that there are hundreds of varieties of flour (yes, hundreds).  Presumably he was using a modern flour as available from his local supermarket.  It has to be asked how can he be sure that the flour he used was a reasonably close match with what was generally available in medieval times.  How can he know that his results were not affected by any one of the various additives commonly used to affect the properties of the flour?   \nIn the 1930s, some flour began to be enriched with iron, niacin, thiamine and riboflavin. In the 1940s, mills started to enrich flour and folic acid was added to the list in the 1990s.  Might we presume that Colin’s flour was of this type? \nIn stone ground flour, it is not uncommon for stone chips from the mill stones to find their way into the flour and they have to be removed.  Did the medieval millers know about this?  During the Industrial Revolution it was discovered that flour would become rancid and had a limited shelf life.  The fatty acids from the germ begin to react with oxygen from the moment they are milled.  In the 19th century, removing the germ was the effective solution.  What was the solution in medieval times, or did the flour always have to be fresh, and was the germ left intact?  \nMedieval flour in Europe commonly had a high rye content.  Do the results still work with rye flour?  Bleaching additives are now commonly used, but are prohibited in some regimes.  \nColin would know that what we may consider as a simple ingredient, is in fact quite a complex substance, which has varied over the course of history and is variable in different cultures.  He needs to ensure that the flour he has been using conforms to what was available in medieval times, and is representative of presumably what was then European type flour. \nCheck Wiki for just how variable flour can be:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour\n\n","date":"June 23, 2015 at 11:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/a-shameless-plug/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Shameless Plug"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“All the results came out between 1200 and 1400, during the last 50 years of which the Shroud is known to have been in existence.

I personally feel that its significance is somewhat more profound, in that it is a witness to the mortal life and death of Jesus Christ. The cloth’s survival to the present from ancient times, is I think a favourable argument towards its authenticity. The Image of Edessa, whether or not it was the same object as the Shroud, was credited with preserving the city from invasion only so long as it remained there, which may be its only talismanic reputation. Another supernatural property it has, is its witness and encouragement to Faith and belief, for the wavering doubting Thomases. \nAlthough I’m inclined to think that the image is very likely naturalistic, I still see it at least as a second class miracle, in that the particular environmental circumstances which produced the image must have been clearly an Act of Providence as all other deliberate attempts to reproduce it have been unsuccessful. I’m aware of only two other known cases where a dead human body has produced a comparable image.  \nAs to the question of radiation being a cause: I have frequently referred to the experimental work by Giovanna De Liso in the seismically active area of Piedmont over a period of some 12 years. She has produced the most persuasive images I have seen, those of a snake and also a metallic object both with 3-D properties. Earthquakes are known to produce the heavy inert radioactive gas ‘radon’, which emits radiation.  Radiation from radon has been implicated as a significant cause of cancer in occupants of apartment buildings in the USA.\nThe gospel accounts of the crucifixion relate that a swarm of earthquakes occurred, including one credited with moving the rock from the entrance to the tomb.\nA minor criticism of De Liso’s work is that she used relatively thin objects, compared to that of a human body. Others have experimented with producing images specifically involving radon gas.\n“Shroud-like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010.\nhttp://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf \nCopies of the images she produced are clearly shown in the paper, and are I think persuasive.\nEarthquakes are a little on my mind at present, as in Wellington we are feeling regular shocks from a daily swarm of shallow 5.8 shakes off the NE coast of the South Island, barely 20 miles away.\n\n","date":"July 20, 2013 at 5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/20/any-good-reasons-for-associating-anything-supernatural-with-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Any good reasons for associating anything supernatural with the shroud?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Quot homines, tot senentiae!

Matthew mentions two earthquakes, one upon the death of Jesus when the temple veil was rent; the second upon the visit of the holy women at the tomb. Mark and Luke only mention that the temple veil was rent, but an earthquake is a good naturalistic explanation for this occurrence; otherwise it is necessary to assert that all three synoptic sources attribute the veil tearing to direct divine intervention. \nI am personally acquainted with rocks being hurled some distance from their faces during earthquakes, and this can be confirmed by any other engineer or geophycist familiar with earthquakes. The sealing of the tomb would increase the likelihood of the ‘P’ wave accomplishing this. Matthew introduces an angel of the Lord at this point to signal divine intervention, but it is an earthquake nevertheless. \nThe Resurrection was not an apparition or a ghost. The scriptural writers clearly saw it as a bodily resurrection; Jesus ate and drank; we have him walking with disciples on the road to Emmaus, but somehow disguised; Thomas was able to touch his wounds, We have Jesus preparing breakfast by Lake Galilee.

Ergo Contradiction!  We need to probe further.  How did the space come to be?  Will the scientific method eventually give an aswer to that question?  Why does the space of our universe have three perceptible linear dimensions and one perceptible time dimension?  Are there more dimensions than those directly perceptible but “curled up” as some seriously speculate? Are there other universes with different perceptible dimensions and different physical constants than our universe?  Why does our universe have “Goldilocks” properties?

He is also amenable to modifying his views when that is where his science takes him.  I have a copy of his “Brief History of Time”, published in 1996, but which I expect even now is somewhat dated.  It is a beautifully illustrated book, with excellent graphics and is worthwhile even for its historic sections on the various pioneers in cosmology, as well as for presenting the various concepts.  He has quite a lot to say about the “anthropic principle”, and poses several leading questions.   \nHe deals with the discovery of the “background microwave radiation”, the clincher for the “Big Bang”.  It was first identified in 1965 by Arno Penzias & Robert Wilson working with the Holmdel N.J. horn antenna.  The radiation persisted even after cleaning the pigeon droppings out of the horn and excluding other effects, and was omni-directional.  Meanwhile, at nearby Princeton U, Bob Dicke and Jim Peebles deduced from George Gamow’s model of the early universe, that there should be background microwave radiation.  They were preparing to look for it when the work of Enzias & Wilson came to light.  But it was Enzias & Wilson who received the 1978 Nobel prize, not Dicke & Peebles and not even Gamow. \nThe initial expansion was extremely rapid.  Initially beginning at the point of singularity quantum effects make the laws of physics unknown.  At 10^(-47) seconds, temperature is 10^32 deg K and commences the “Grand Unification Theory (GUT) epoch”.  At 10^(-34) seconds, temperature is 10^27 deg and commences the quark-antiquark epoch.  At 10^(-10) seconds, temperature is 10^15 deg and we have the formation of protons, neutrons and mesons, quarks are confined and anti-quarks disappear.  At 1 second, temperature is 10^10 deg, protons and neutrons bind together as nuclei of hydrogen, helium, lithium and deuterium.  At 3 minutes, temp is 10^9 deg, matter and radiation couple together.  At 300,000 years, temp has fallen to 3000 deg, matter and radiation decouple as electrons bind together with nuclei.  The universe then becomes transparent to the cosmic background radiation.  At 1 billion years, clusters of matter form quasars, stars and protogalaxies.  Stars burning primordial hydrogen and helium synthesize heavier nuclei.

To produce the image by radiation, each beam would have to be extremely narrowly focused to hit just the crowns.  The only possible way that I can think of is for some kind of interference pattern resonant with the crowns, maybe as a sequence of reflections from the cloth, and then back onto the cloth.  But that may be too speculative and coincidental altogether.\nI think you’re being too narrowly focused and selective in ignoring all the other forensic evidence, and I don’t see that that can be good science.\nThe presence of Dead Sea halophyte pollen and other Palestinan pollens, Jerusalem travertine aragonite limestone road-dust around the feet, the wrist nailing, reflex action of the thumbs, accuracy of the blood flows and other anatomical accuracies, detailed correspondence of the wounds with the gospel accounts, the use of Middle East looms to weave the cloth evidenced by cotton contamination, the Vignon markings, the triple burn holes and herring bone weave as shown on the Hungarian Pray maunscript, and a credible reconstruction of the Shroud’s history.  The cumulative evidence is too insistent!\nYou choose to turn your back on all of this and assert that some unknown genius fraudster did it all merely with the aid of a bas relief model.  You should not wonder that so many of us find your thesis incredible, even if we could allow that the image may have been achieved by some unknown scorching process!\nAs for Carbon dating, it might not indeed now be possible to obtain a reliable dating even with improved sampling because of all the treatment that the cloth has been subject to over the ages, including bacterial contamination and fire and likely absorption of CO2.\n\n","date":"February 28, 2012 at 4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/25/bertrand-russell-comes-to-mind/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Bertrand Russell comes to mind"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin, even if you were ever able to prove conclusively beyond all shadow of doubt whatsoever, that the image was produced by a scorch, I still would be quite unable to say that the Shroud is a fraud.

It is directed at what he calls “pseudo-science” in the various attempts to understand the processes that may have been involved in forming the image on the Shroud of Turin.  His own particular disciplinary bias is of course Chemistry, as is also that of Sir Paul Maxime Nurse, President of the Royal Society of London.  Important as Chemistry is in coming to an understanding of the image, there is rather more to it than this single discipline is competent to pronounce on, and of course there have been a number of forensic studies to this end.  Indeed being an historic object, it even transcends the limits of the conventional hard sciences, and the discipline of Historians also needs to be called into play.  Furthermore the Shroud is also seen as an important religious object of devotion, displaying with good reason what is seen to be the image of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion and death, whether or not it is indeed his true likeness.  \nSo whether a prestigious Society dedicated to the pursuit of Natural Knowledge only, can bring down a decision on the Shroud’s authenticity may be arguable, although it might be able to make a useful contribution.  Such Societies are of course comprised of persons the product of their own particular culture of time and place.  This is no better illustrated than the case of when Yves Delage, Sorbonne professor of comparative anatomy presented his forensic findings on the Shroud image to the Paris Acadamy of Sciences in 1905.  Although Delage’s findings were well reasoned and scientific, and found a positive response in the medical journal The Lancet, the Academy was so dominated by “freethinkers” and “rationalists” that the dominance of this culture produced an opposition that outweighed the evidence.  Delage had compromised his distinguished scientific career as a result and he turned his attention towards other matters.  \nColin’s letter makes much of the 1988 Carbon dating, perhaps itself a model of pseudo-science, in that carefully designed protocols were ignored, and fundamental principles of representative sampling were set aside.  Nevertheless the laboratories involved proceeded with their testing, asserting that their results had 95% confidence limits.  The Royal Society may also like to address this issue as an attempt at pseudo-science. \nThe provenance of the Shroud itself can only be reliably proven to around the year of 1350.  Sceptics make much of the D’Arcis memorandum, based on Chevalier’s 1900 study and its English translation by Thurston in 1903.  Both men were hostile to the Shroud’s authenticity, and appear to have set out on a deliberate misrepresentation of the value of the memorandum, one writer asserting that Chevalier & Thurston deliberately set out to deceive. \nNevertheless various attempts have been made in the quest for an earlier provenance, many of them however questioned by various scholars in Byzantine history, who appeared to have succumbed to the peril of paying too much attention of heeding “received wisdom” in their discipline, yet another example of a cultural bias and atagonism to authenticity of the relic.  \nWhether an objective response might be expected from the Royal Society is moot.  It is no doubt not less susceptible to the personal biases of its members than any other human institution, as was the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1905.  The following extract on Sir Paul Nurse may be of interest. \n“Nurse criticized the potential Republican candidates for the US presidential nomination for opposing the teaching of natural selection, stem cell research on cell lines from human embryos, and anthropogenic climate change; he blamed scientists in part for not speaking up. He was alarmed that this could happen in the U.S., a world leader in science, “the home of Benjamin Franklin, Richard Feynman and Jim Watson.”\n“One problem, Nurse said, was “treating scientific discussion as if it were political debate,” using rhetorical tricks rather than logic. Another problem was science teaching in the schools, which does not teach citizens how to discuss science, and is compromised by religious schools, even in the United Kingdom.”\n“We need to emphasize why the scientific process is such a reliable generator of knowledge with its respect for evidence, for skepticism, for consistency of approach, for the constant testing of ideas,” wrote Nurse.\n“Finally, scientific leaders “have a responsibility to expose the bunkum,” said Nurse. They should take on politicians, and expose nonsense during elections”\n\n","date":"September 16, 2012 at 7:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/16/better-than-david-rolfes-dawkins-challenge/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Better than David Rolfe’s Dawkins Challenge?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"One problem with the Maillard hypothesis is that both frontal and dorsal images seem to be of equal intensity.  In that case a convection model has obvious objections if the body was lying on its back, and a contact model would then seem more likely.  We do not know that the body was laid on its back.  The rigor mortis and body distortion resulting from crucifixion, such as legs being bent at the hips and knees, may have given laying out problems.  The body may have been laid to rest on its side possibly fully wrapped.  In that case, a convection model would then still give problems.  But even with a contact process, there are then problems with explaining the orthogonality of the image.  \nI’ve previously mentioned Giovanna de Liso’s 12 years of experiments with seismic imaging: “Shroud-like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010.  Other investigators have reported likewise more recently.  De Liso obtained persuasive images from both metallic objects and a dead snake.  The suggestion is that radon (radioactive inert gas released during seismic activity) played a significant role in producing these images.  And of course an earthquake is reported in the gospel passion narratives.  \nAnother radiation experiment was carried out by Dr August Accetta, American radiologist, and founder of the Shroud Center of Southern California.  Dr Accetta injected into his own veins a solution of methylene diphosphate, containing radioactive technetium-99m, a radioisotope with a short half life. The radiation from the technetium atoms produced gamma rays, which could be detected by the VP8 Image Analysing Computer.  Dr Accetta produced an image on the VP8 computer similar, but with less definition, than the Shroud image. \nAny credible naturalistic image formation process needs to explain: relatively uniform intensity of both frontal and dorsal images;  the relatively high resolution of the pixels making up the image;  the 3-dimensional properties of the image;  its orthogonal projection on to the cloth with minimal lateral distortion, and absence of lateral aspects, despite any wrapping of the body.  I believe we are a long way from being able to explain these properties by any of the naturalistic mechanisms suggested to date.\n\n","date":"October 30, 2012 at 3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/29/big-deal-peer-reviewed-scientific-paper-soon-to-be-published/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Big Deal Peer-Reviewed Scientific Paper Soon to Be Published"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Anoxie, many thanks for the detailed summary of Roger’s corresp edited by Thibault.

By this time the Lirey church was in a state of disrepair, and unsuitable to house the Shroud. \nWhat is curious is that the canons should set so much store by what was alleged to be a forgery, that they themselves issued an excommunication, and it only required a cash settlement to appease them and to lift it.  So who are the ones demonstrating cupidity in this   matter?  Margaret seems to be the one practising a religious duty to ensure the safety of this relic, by delivering it to the House of Savoy which kept it safe for 500 years!   The chateau of Varambon with which she was compensated, had already been in the Palud family for several generations, the family of her nearest relation, her nephew the flamboyant Francis de Palud.  \nAs for Bishop D’Arcis declaring the shroud a “fake”, each and every occupant of the See of Rome since the time of Pope Pius XI has made it clear enough that they personally considered it to be the authentic burial cloth of Christ!

Soon after, the king’s entire retinue set off on a royal tour first to Burgundy, and then to Avignon where they were entertained by Pope Clement VII. \nClement was formerly known as Robert of Geneva, his father being a cousin of Aimon of Geneva, the step-father of Geoffrey II.  If anyone knew anything about the true origins of the Shroud, it seems quite likely that Clement might well have been privy to it, with the presence of both Charles VI and Geoffrey II in Avignon when D’Arcis was raising his objections.  \nOn 5 January 1390, Clement sent a letter to D’Arcis to keep silent about the Shroud under threat of excommunication.  On the same date, Clement also sent a letter to Geoffrey II stating that he could continue to hold the Shroud expositions, but he should limit the lavishness of the ceremonial.  There was then no mention that Geoffrey was required to describe the Shroud as a “figure or representation of Jesus’ shroud”. \nConceivably if he had access to the papal archives, Clement may even known or heard about the Greek Patriarch’s complaint to an earlier Pope that Frankish crusaders had pillaged the sacred burial cloths from Constantinople. \nClement was clearly not persuaded by D’Arcis’ objections, and his actions in the matter seem to be those of a shrewd pontiff responding to a tricky situation, the advice from his legate, and aware that if the Shroud was in fact authentic, it might possibly prompt an adverse reaction from Constantinople.  \nFor the next 500 years, the expositions were essentially a Savoy affair, and it was only with the results of the photography in 1898, that the Shroud attracted the interest raised during the 20th century.\n\n","date":"May 11, 2015 at 3:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/09/colin-berry-has-it-all-figured-out-sort-of-maybe/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Has It All Figured Out, Sort Of, Maybe"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Bailli Venderesse warrant: “… so that I may relocate it in another church in Troyes and place it under honest custody.”\nIf not the cathedral, what other church in Troyes might have been intended?

I consider that Markwardt makes an adequate case of deliberate fraud against Chevalier & Thurston and that is enough, others can make their own inferences as to what that might mean,  The best that might be said for D’Arcis, is that he might have been genuinely concerned at misrepresentation of what he considered a false relic, but that he was mistaken on many matters, relying on hearsay, and even though he was qualified in Law, he failed to produce concrete evidence to support his case, to the extent that Pope Clement VII commanded him to silence, and allowed Geoffrey II to resume the expositions. \nIt is indeed fortunate, even providential for posterity, that Magaret de Charney was so intrepid in her designs to retain the Shroud instead of returning it to an unsuitable church is a state of disrepair.

That is not exactly correct.  The Fanti-Malfi designed Cyclic Loads machine provides persuasive evidence that the TS dates to within 400 years of the first century.\nThe dating is necessarily coarse, as age is not the only variable determining the physical properties measured.  Other effective variables include environmental, such as humidity and temperature, as well as subsequent history such as folding, storage and exposure, as well as extreme events such as fire.  Some of these variables can be partially but not completely obviated by careful examination and preselection of samples to ensure that they are indeed representative, and by normalisation of the measurements to standard conditions.   \nCalibration was achieved in 350 loading-unloading stress cycles of 85 different flax fibres from 12 different modern and ancient fabrics of known provenance dating back to more than 5000 years ago.  Of the five parameters tested, none fell below a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.90, satisfying the test for significance.  Some 8 fibres from the TS obtained in 1978 were selected for testing as being suitable candidates for testing and as not being affected by extremes of damage. \nThe testing placed the age of the TS as 400 AD, +/- 400 years.  A first century date would therefore be admissible by this method.  Clearly a 14th century or other medieval date would not be admissible. \nBy way of contrast, the 1988 C-14 radiocarbon testing was only carried out on a single sample of highly doubtful representative value in respect of the whole fabric.  \nThe pollen sampling carried out by various investigators, Frei, Danin and others has been subject to much critical evaluation, notably by Hugh Farey in his recent BSTS article.  However even in the case of the Farey article it was apparent that there remained pollen residuals of exclusively Jerusalem origin.  The flight distance Tel Aviv to Paris is some 2022 miles (3254 km) across the Anatolian mountains and Swiss Alps, which is a little too far for wind-blown pollen to reach the village of Lirey in eastern France.  \nThe only paint flakes found by the STURP team were attributed to contamination by painted copies brought into contact with the TS in various kinds of “contagious sanctification” rituals, or from flakes falling on it from old frescoes in the rooms where it had been stored.  No residuals of paint were found between the fibres as original material indicating that it had ever been painted.  The calcium cabonate made much of in the Charles Freeman gesso hypothesis, is easily attributed to the retting process acquired during linen extraction along with the iron and strontium contamination. \nSuch scientific evidence as there is, makes a better case for a 1st century Jerusalem provenance than it can for a 14th century Franco-German provenance, for which latter no significant scientific evidence has been proffered at all, or is at least easily disposed of.\n\n","date":"November 9, 2014 at 8:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/colin-berry-wants-feedback/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Wants Feedback"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The hair is not such a problem.

It may be presumed that the vast majority survived and walked to the place of crucifixion carrying at least the cross-beam, not necessarily with any assistance.  Scourging of Roman citizens was limited to 40 lashes.  A Jewish executioner was limited to administering 40 lashes, but in practice the limit they adopted was 39 (presumably a religio-safety margin on the prescribed 40).  Roman scourging of non-Romans could and did exceed 40.  The 372 marks claimed in the Faccini-Fanti paper have not been corroborated by anyone else, and all earlier investigators have said that there were between 90 and 120 marks occurring in pairs corresponding to about 60 lashes.  \nThe reference to Isaiah 1:6 was written by a Proto-Isaiah, and much of his writings are more a proclamation  than a prophecy reflecting the situation in 8th century Israel in the time of Hezekiah.\nIs 1:6:  “From the sole of the foot to the head there is no sound spot in it; Just bruise and welt and oozing wound, not drained, or bandaged, or eased with salve.”\nIt is an accusation against Israel’s wickedness, and need not be interpreted as an oracle.  \nThe Proto-Isaiah has written most of chapters 1-39, with a few chapters attributed to his disciples, and are preoccupied with 8th century Israel.  Deutero-Isaiah include chapters 40-55, and are attributed to an anonymous poet writing towards the end of the Babylonian exile.  These chapters include the servant songs, and have often been seen as oracles reflected in the New Testament understanding of the passion and glorification of Christ.  Chapters 56-65, Trito-Isaiah, are oracles by post-exilic writers imbued with the spirit of Isaiah. \nThe Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter illustration of the scourging of Christ is an early example of quite similar depictions of a fully scourged back as the 14th century works, but clearly does not depend on 14th century concepts of the scourging,  It dates from 800-815 AD, there are close correspondences with the Shroud image, and it is known that there were close Carolingian affinities with the Byzantine court.  It may suggest some familiarity with a Byzantine Shroud image which may have been known at this time. \nThe pattern of scourge marks on the Shroud match what is known of the Roman flagrum.  If the flagrum was indeed used to inflict them, then clearly they did not tear at the flesh, but in many cases they seem to have penetrated the skin.  I would interpret them as a controlled preliminary punishment, and by spreading them over the whole body, there would be some assurance that the prisoner would survive, for the end sentence of crucifixion.  There is no concentration of the punishment at localised areas, which might result in tearing of flesh.  I should say they are what one might expect from a knowledgeable disciplined executioner, who is informed that his punishment must not result in the death of his prisoner. \nThe distressing picture of the scourged victim provided by Max above, would indicate that it is indeed possible to inflict a severe scourging covering the entire back, and for the victim of it yet to survive, even in a seated posture.\n\n","date":"May 19, 2015 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It’s a sad case, too narrowly focused, ignoring all other evidence to the contrary.

From the blood-flows on the arms, Barbet calculates that the crucified arms were at about 65 degrees to the vertical.  \nHe counted 100 to 120 visible dumbell shaped scourge wounds inflicted by the two-thonged Roman flagrum, implying about 60 visible lashes, and inflicted by two executioners, the taller one standing to the right and the shorter to the left.  This may account for any symmetry of the wounds lower down on the buttocks.  Only blows that pierced the skin and caused bleeding are visible.  Blows that would cause bruising only would not be so visible.  I don’t know about any blood pooling at the lower back, Barbet doesn’t mention it, and it’s not evident to me, but you may be correct, I’m not sure. Perhaps someone else can comment.  \nBarbet claims the scourging was inflicted with the victim being bound to a post, facing it, and with his arms above his head, as there are no scourge marks on the arms.  However one of the executioners had a trick of using the flagrum so that it whipped around and also inflicted wounds to the front of the legs. \nBarbet himself was a highly experienced pathologist, and had conducted several experiments with recent cadavers and amputated limbs, to check his findings.  Having read through much of his descriptions, amd his repeated assertions that all the wounds are anatomically correct, together with his detailed explanations, I feel that any allegations that the image is not based on a real crucified body can only be based on an ignorance which trivialises the facts.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2013 at 7:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/16/colin-berrys-big-day-tomorrow/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry’s Big Day Tomorrow"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Here is my Highly Serendipitous Theory of the Turin Shroud Scorch Hypothesis – in short HSTTSSH, the significance of this acronym becoming clear as I outline the details of the theory below.  Being a Highly Serendipitous Theory, it has several elements to it outlined as follows: \n1.  It is a matter of sound Christian Doctrine that Christ’s body after his death was transformed to a resurrected body.  Now a body comprises various biological cells.  However these cells are rejuvenated by the ingestion of food and other nourishment, not part of the body, and old cells are disposed of by the process of digestion and are ejected in the normal way.  Clearly these old cells are also no longer part of the body, and therefore we cannot expect that they would have been part of the resurrection process, and their residues would have been left behind.\n2. One of the products that are expelled include significant quantities of methane gas, a highly inflammable compound.  The human and animal expulsion of methane is a major factor in global warming, and is addressed in those forums such as KYOTO protocols.  It is a major consideration in NZ where there are some 40 million sheep for instance.  In sewerage plants, the amount of methane is quite enough to be used as a fuel for the various pumps, lighting generators and other machinery to make the plant energy consumption self-sufficient.  \n3.  In the Catholic Epistle of I Peter 3:18-19, we are told that Christ, having been put to death, that “in the SPIRIT, He went to preach to the spirits in prison”, that is to those who had already died, or in other words some abode of Hell.  This found expression in the Apostolicum – the Apostles’ Creed – of about 200 AD, “descendit ad inferna, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis”.  \n4.  Now we know that Hell is a very hot place, with fiery elements, sufficient to act as an ignition aource to any methane that might be hanging about.  Clearly as Christ returned from “inferna” to attend to the business of resurrection, this is what happened. \n5.  Dr Berry by his own experimental research has succeeded in convincing himself that the Shroud image is a scorch. He claims that scorching of linen can have the effect of imparting 3-dimensional information, as shown on the Shroud, that the scorching can be superficial, as shown by examination of the linen fibrils.  And it is now apparent what the source of the scorching was.\n6.The elements of serendipity are as follows: (a) It affirms the CB theory of scorching; (b) It affirms the canonicity of I Peter, and the Apostolicum; (c) It affirms the doctine of two natures – divine because he was resurrected – he was also human in that he expelled methane (in a word, he farted) (d) it provides a coherent explanation of image formation on the burial cloths (e) The incineration cleaned up the mess left by any residual sewage, not part of the resurrected body. \n7.  The significance of the acronym HSTTSSH is now plain.  This is the euphonious assonance of the escaping gases.  I knew all along that the idea of a metal template was crazy.  The HSTTSSH is a far more credible explanation.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2013 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/16/colin-berrys-big-day-tomorrow/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry’s Big Day Tomorrow"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If David Onysko has been following this blog site any time at all over the last few years he might have noted that I am informed as well as anyone on what was and what was not achieved by STURP. I also happen to be aware of how the team came together, how it was funded, who the participants were, what equipment they used, and the particular difficulties they encountered.  I regret that I have never had the opportunity to meet any of them personally.  \nI am also apprised of what other studies have been carried out, from the time of Paul Vignon, Pierre Barbet, various other pioneers, the secret Turin Commission of Cardinal Pellegrino 1969-73, and have been an avid follower of many subsequent developments, researches and studies since. I have a computer file of about 1GB on various research papers and other material, although perhaps a modest size compared to those of a few others. \nIt has been said that the Shroud of Turin is the most intensely studied object in human history.  Others have said it is also the most badly studied object in human history. \nThe STURP team went in blind, not knowing what they would find, and some have said with too limited an agenda.  But that was in 1978, some 36 years ago.  The Science has moved on, and there are now techniques available which STURP could then only dream about. \nNevertheless there remain other approaches, other experiments which do not require direct access to the relic itself. There has been too little experimentation and few attempts to discover how a dead body might leave an image on a particular type of linen cloth. Ray Rogers succeeded in colouring Edgerton bleached linen treated with dextrin and saponaria, by a 10 minute exposure to ammonia.  Giovanna De Liso obtained some success during her 12 years of experiments in a seismic environment. \nThese experiments have had insufficient follow-up and further development.  Instead, researchers are fiddling with excimer lasers, and scorching kitchen tea towels.  \nA concerted programme of research is required, but it needs a source of funds, dedicated and multi-disciplined research scientists, and carefully designed experiments. God-given human rationality demands that naturalistic explanations be reasonably well-exhausted before resorting to premature claims of the supernatural and miraculous. Despite what has been achieved in the 116 years since Secondo Pia’s first photographs, we remain still in the early stages of this exploration.\n\n","date":"March 21, 2014 at 4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/20/comment-promoted-another-hypothesis-about-the-image-formation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted:  Another hypothesis about the image formation"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"In the first two pages available in the ‘Springer’ link, there are few clues as to the hypothesis that the authors are postulating, except that the TS image may be some kind of post mortem effect.  There are very few other instances of image formation, the ‘Veil of Antinoe’ now lost, the ‘Jospice mattress cover’ which is contentious, and now this 71 year old man who had been dead some weeks, and in a state of progressive putrefaction.  \nThe TS man shows no such signs of corruption, and it is a long stretch to see how this latest event can be relevant to the TS case. This latest image seems to been caused by leakage of putrescent body fluids, and it is hard to see how the two cases can be connected, as the cause of imaging would seem to be quite different in the two cases.  Clearly the TS image has not been caused by any noticable corruption effect.  \nI am firmly of the opinion that until sufficient experimentation has been carried out with recently dead bodies and which can successfully demonstrate imaging with similar properties as the TS image, then it will continue to remain an unresolved enigma.  I suspect that the latest case of this unfortunate 71 year old man leaving a pattern of his bodily fluids on a carpet may add little to our understanding of TS image formation.  Any hypothesis postulated by the author from this event would seem to be no more than speculation at this stage.

Only Mary Magdalen was able to say that ‘I know my Redeemer liveth’ with certain knowledge because she had seen him. The rest of us can only accept it as a matter of faith. \nThe Shroud of Turin is a material object in the present here and now, with an enigmatic image on it.  One good reason why we cannot explain the image, is not because that it is necessarily miraculous, but because there really has not been sufficient research carried out on this particular phenomenon. It is rational to explore naturalistic explanations before resorting to claims of miracles.  This has yet to be done, despite the various attempts already made. One good reason why there has not been the research neccesary, is that the object is a rare and carefully guarded relic which is rightly taken to be precious, and very likely sacred, and so access to it is made difficult.  We may believe the image to be miraculous, but this cannot yet be claimed as a fact.

In the ancient world, slaves were counted as little value and were often whipped to death.  In the American south, slaves were considered more valuable, and punishments inflicted were less severe and more seldom fatal.  Beginning in 1948, British courts were restricted in prescribing whipping for most offences, but it continued in Delaware until 1972 for which whipping was prescribed for some 25 different offences.  \nThe lash, or cat-o’-nine-tails was a particularly severe instrument.  Possibly the nastiest one was the Russian knout, dried and hardened rawhide thongs interwoven with wires, hooked and sharpened so as to tear the flesh.  The Roman instrument was of course the flagrum.  \nScourging was a usual preliminary to crucifixion, and in order to carry out the court’s sentence, the victim had to be left with sufficient strength to carry at least the cross-beam to his place of execution, so presumably this would serve as some control on the severity of the beating.  \nVignon, Barbet and others since have analysed the traces on the Shroud.  Barbet made the point that only those blows which penetrated the skin have left their mark, while those which resulted only in bruising did not.  Correspondents may be familiar with the Faccini-Fanti paper presented at the Frascati conference in 2010 on the subject.  Some of their findings may be debatable and contested.  However their experiments included a simulated scourging with instruments that would leave similar marks on a drum coated with both white paper and carbon paper.  Their paper depicts the results of this experiment.  They claim that similar marks to the TS image was obtained if both a flagrum and a “pear rod” was used in delivering the punishment.   \nMost artistic depictions of the scourging of Christ, seem to lack a specific realism, and would seem to depend only on the diverse artists’ gruesome imaginations, although doubtless some of them would have witnessed actual whipping punishments whenever they were in vogue. \nA particular point is that, skin lacerations as would be produced say by the Russian knout, or the English cat, might not be the case with a controlled use of the flagrum.  The Roman flagrum is known to have been used in gladiatorial contests, and presumably was not necessarily fatal, unless administered with considerable brutality.\n\n","date":"May 17, 2015 at 5:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"More incorrect unsubstantiated dogmatic claims to suit a peculiar world view! \n“…  it is unlikely because early Christians did not collect relics any more than Protestants do today.”  The practice of relic collection among early Christians cannot be known with certainty, as persecutions resulted in any such practices being kept secret until the Edict of Milan in 313 AD granting toleration and making such secrecy no longer necessary.  Much of the early church was Hellenist or Syriac and would not have had the same traditional aversion to cultic objects as Jewish Christians. \nUntil about 380 AD in Rome, Christian burials were in the catacombs.  These are decorated with early Christian art works from earlier centuries.  The catacombs of Commodilla include the earliest known portrayal of a bearded Christ.  The present compulsory liturgical practice of an altar stone containing holy relics, dates from the times of using the tombs of the martyrs as a type of altar to celebrate secretly the liturgy of the Eucharist there.  \nNot long after 326 AD St Helena made her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and it is evident that early writers saw it as a recovery of the primitive relics of Christianity.  They were put to the practical use of lending a type of “heavenly mandate” to the Byzantine imperial dynasty, Constantine putting one of the crucifixion nails into his helmet, and making a bridle for his horse out of another, clearly as talismans. \nThe various tales concerning the Image of Edessa and the Image of Camuliana testify to an interest in cloths deemed to have had contact with Christ and leaving an image, some said to be made not by human hands, much of this interest dating from well before the sixth century.  There are references to the burial cloths in various other early writings, including the Gospel to the Hebrews, apocryphal and pseud-epigrapha, as well as other testimonies. \nThere could have been no iconoclastic movement without at least an underlying folk interest in such holy objects. \nIf it is considered so important as to twist the facts of history in order to sustain one’s specious and worthless hypothesis, they should at least be chosen so as not to be so easily rebutted!\n\n","date":"June 12, 2015 at 7:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/11/comment-promoted-charles-freeman-comes-closest/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted:  Charles Freeman Comes Closest"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"We can’t say whether the natural hypothesis is unlikely or not.

It heralded a new era of openness for the People of God, but it still seems that a few of us yet need to catch up. \nSignificant documents relating to the discussion above include: Lumen Gentium, Constitution of the Church, particularly the all-inclusive chapter 2 as to who comprise the People of God;  the Decree on Ecumenism, Unitatis Redintegratio;  Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions, Nostra Aetate;  and the Declaration on Religious Freedom, Dignitatis Humanae.   It ought to be enlightening for the combatants in the above discussion to revisit and reread these important documents.  Perhaps they may thus be able to refresh their perspectives on the place and need for dialogue with others of different persuasions. \nIn the United Kingdom, Western Europe, the United States, and several countries enjoying a British heritage (Australia, New Zealand, Canada), Religious Freedom is now too easily taken for granted.  However even in those places it is a comparatively recent innovation, not much older than the 20th century, and even so it remains vulnerable and is frequently threatened by hostile forces.  In many other countries it is utterly unknown, and the concept is unfamiliar to their traditions.   \nThe world is rapidly evolving into societies of religious pluralism, and we need to learn how we may cope with this diversity of belief, and yet continue in our attempts to live peaceably with one another.  The alternative is unthinkable.    \nDuring his recent trip to Turin, Pope Francis with his visit to family in the Po Valley made a point of also visiting the Waldensian communities there.  His efforts at reaching out to other religious communities gives an example that ought to be emulated at the grass roots. \nThe recent conference at Hampshire would seem to have offered such an opportunity of dialogue with a particular non-christian group, and it would seem that attendance by some Christians there was entirely appropriate and in accord with the principles of dialogue, ecumenism and expressions of religious freedom enjoined by the Council and by Pope Francis.\n\n","date":"September 20, 2015 at 4:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There is clearly some confusion between what might be held as doctrinal beliefs by various groups, and those who hold such beliefs, human beings all made in the image of their Creator.  I am unaware of any papal approval of the doctrinal “contentions of the Waldensians”, a 12th century sect which later modeled its doctrines on a type of Swiss Protestantism.  In June, Pope Francis became the first pontiff to visit a Waldensian evangelical church, not to commend their doctrines, but to seek their forgiveness of his church’s historic brutal persecutions of their members.  \nLikewise, regardless of what beliefs the Ahmadiyah sect of Islam might hold, it is unlikely that any pontiff would subscribe to them, but he might well seek dialogue with those who in accordance with the teachings of Lumen Gentium, honestly seek God according to what they believe.  \nEarlier this evening, a newscast noted that Pope Francis spent some 40 cordial minutes with a frail and elderly Fidel Castro, the revolutionary communist leader who persecuted religion, isolated Cuba from the rest of the western hemisphere, and almost brought global catastrophe with the threat of nuclear war during the Bay of Pigs incident.  This coming Wednesday, Francis will visit the USA, no doubt with a message concerning that nation’s capitalist dominance, and I wonder if he will be received as cordially as he was in Cuba.  \nDespite the English persecution of Catholics such as Edmund Campion, execution of countless priests for their celebration of the Mass, and the later persecution of the national religion of Ireland,  I shall not be seeking the approval of any present correspondent for my sharing in any ecumenical celebrations with my neighbouring Anglican parishioners.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2015 at 2:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"On the contrary its logic is clearly apparent, as it is a natural consequence of the four specific Vatican Council II documents that I mentioned.

The sole purpose of the sedile was to prolong the death agony, and it was extra work for the carpenters to provide it. It is seldom shown in crucifixion art work, but that of course can be discounted as not significant. The gospel accounts all have Jesus dying within three hours of being crucufied, and Pilate expressed surprise that he had died so soon. This would argue against the use of the sedile.

Viewing these stereos gave the effect of being suspended several hundred feet above the terrain, and could almost be vertigo inducing.  The effect works by parallax, photographs of the same terrain viewed from different positions along the flight path.  Each eye views a single photograph, and the brain does the rest giving a visual 3-D impression.  Binoculars create s similar effect on real 3D objects by a virtual stretching of the base-line between the eyes. \nThe 3D imaging of the VP-8 analyser seems to work in a different way.  There is only one original image, but as I understand it, the 3D is encoded by variations in brightness.  It would seem that the 3D holograms of the VP8 Shroud image have been somehow backwards coded to give the two stereoscopic pairs necessary to create the effect when the two related images are viewed.  One question might be how well the two stereoscopic pairs have been derived from the original hologram object.  This might account for some of the peculiarities reported in the comments.  \nI endeavoured to follow Hugh’s tip on using an A4 cardboard sheet, but did not succeed.

I knew him to be a determinist of the first order, but then he did not have the advantage of knowing about the quantum.  There is an apocryphal story that when Napoleon asked him why God did not appear in his work on the system of the universe that Laplace had replied “Ah sir, I had no need of that hypothesis!”  But apparently the hypothesis referred to was Isaac Newton’s assertion that God sometimes needed to intervene to restore the system’s stability as Newton had not analysed the system so well as had Laplace.  At his approaching death, Laplace had demanded that the anecdote be removed from his biography, but the publishers decided otherwise, and so it passed into mythology. \nIt seems that in real life Laplace had wavered between atheism and deism.  In 1809 he had written to his son, “I pray that God watches over your days. Let Him be always present to your mind, as also your father and your mother.”  There is an enduring view that he died an agnostic, albeit with the last rites of the church, but his actual views on religion remain too ambiguous to be certain.  The Wikipedia article is most enlightening as it deals with the question of God’s intervention, and a celebrated scientist’s thoughts and views on the place of God in science.  Check the sections on “Political Philosophy” and “Religious Opinions” at\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace  \nWhen it comes to the debate as to whether the Shroud image is naturalistic or miraculous, I am open to either view. Nor do I agree with Hugh’s assertion that if it is miraculous, then we can forget physics.  I do not think it is quite so easy.  It too readily forgets the Christian doctrine that all Creation is necessarily of God.  At the risk of an anthropomorphism, “Who can read the mind of God?”  God may tailor a situation how He will.  He may well tailor a natural situation to his own purposes, exploiting the properties of His creation to suit His own purposes.

You are certainly not the first to do so.  Spectacular success in any walk of life is seldom achieved without having to face down the opponents of new ideas, and also rising above one’s failures.\nYou are clearly certain the image is a scorch.  You therefore seem to have ruled out any other kind of natural process that might result in a human corpse generating the image, say by some kind of as yet unknown photo-sensitive action.\nI think the problem that most of us have with that concept, is that we cannot conceive that anyone in medieval times, would be capable of constructing any kind of sculptural model, with all the accurate forensic evidence we now know the image contains.

The apparent lack of chemical residues, I take to mean refers to the absence of any foreign material applied to the linen, and not byproducts from whatever happened to the linen (oxidation?).\nI feel that little headway will be made as long as the assumption of a fraudster at work is maintained.  The forensic evidence argues too strongly against it.  I have to reject the template hypothesis.\nI think we must look for some other contact process being involved, if it indeed it was some kind of natural process.  I’ve made the observation elsewhere that pressed dried flora will leave an image on paper after a period of time.  I wonder what that process is,  I don’t think its mere absorption.\nI can’t help feeling that somehow there must be some kind of photon exchange between the object and the linen, but I’m starting to get out of my depth.  Whatever it was, it didn’t leave a lateral image.  Was the linen somehow photo-sensitized during the wrapping process.  100 pounds of a myrrhic-aleotic mixture sounds fairly potent?\nIf a natural contact process cannot be identified, we must remain in the dark about it, and be left with the only other logical inference that can be made.\n\n","date":"February 21, 2012 at 3:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/19/i-dont-get-it-writes-a-reader-about-colin-berrys-hypothesis/","cat":"image_theory","title":"I don’t get it, writes a reader about Colin Berry’s Hypothesis"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The detailed forensic evidence would be beyond the understanding of any medievalist or ante-medievalist, regardless of whether their names were Leonardo da Vinci, Philon of Byzantium or Heron of Alexandria.

It will add to our knowledge and understanding of the image, albeit in a negative way.  Some other process must be sought if a naturalistic explanation is to be obtained.  We may not conclude by such negative evidence that the image is necessarily a consequence of the Resurrection,  There may be some other naturalistic explanation: a current candidate explanation, one that has yet to be thought of, or a process as yet unknown to science. \nI do not understand the Jos Verhulst comment: “there is no reason why this unique image should happen to be the image of Christ”.  Certainly thousands of Jews were sent to their death by crucifixion during the Roman period, about 3000 following the death of Herod the Great, and several more around 70 AD, and doubtless countless others.  However on the assumption that the Shroud is of authentic 1st C provenance, there is considerable evidence that the TSM is indeed Jesus Christ.  All the wounds match the gospel accounts of his suffering and death.  But the clincher is the scalp wounds caused by the crown (cap) of thorns, inflicted by the whim of a Roman soldier in response to the purported charge the “King of the Jews”.  This was not a standard or even occasional punishment, and Jesus Christ is the only crucifixion victim known to have been so capped.  Even the arch-sceptic Thurston has said of the image, “Of the identity of the victim there can be no doubt.  If it is not Christ then it was intended to be his likeness.” \nAs far as proof of resurrection is concerned, this is provided by the fact of the image, rather than its unknown cause:  the fact that it is of a crucifixion victim, showing no corruption, so that the image was formed within 36 hours after death, and then image formation ceased.  If there had been no resurrection, then we might expect that the process would have continued, probably showing signs of corruption, and even blurring of the image,  Deliberate removal of the body from its burial cloths at this stage is too incredible to contemplate. \nThe references to the upper side of the body versus the lower side beg the question that the body was in fact lying on its back.  We cannot know this, and the no flattening of the buttocks area may suggest that it was in fact lying on its side.  \nI concur with Jos Verhulst, that any naturalistic explanation must account for the clarity of the image, its relatively high visual resolution, its evenness, and I must say the fact that it shows an orthogonal aspect on the cloth, with no lateral distortion nor images of the sides.  I will also agree that these requirements make a naturalistic explanation extremely difficult to conceive, but that is not to say impossible.\n\n","date":"September 19, 2012 at 4:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/18/latest-on-david-rolfes-site-on-maillard-reaction/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Latest on David Rolfe’s Site on Maillard Reaction"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"JK: “If I am wrong, show me a sharply defined image that arose on a burial cloth within 48 hours of death.” \nJohn, Two other cases are known. The Jospice mattress cover, and another. The second was that of an ancient Egyptian woman, but I forget all the details, but think it might have been on some type of veil. The veil was in the Louvre museum for some years, but either the image disappeared or the veil was lost without trace. You might be able to Google for more details. Max Patrick Hamon brought it to my attention over the last year or so.  \nJospice mattress cover: “Jospice Mattress Imprint”, Peter Carr, Fr O’Leary PDF on Shroud website:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/imprint.pdf \n“Can the Jospice Mattress Imprint be compared to the Image on the Shroud?” Louis C. de Figueiredo:\nhttp://holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/can_the_jospice_mattress_imprint.mht_2.pdf\nThe second paper is written in what I think is rather turgid prose, but you can read past that. \nMy own views on the TS image are that it may or may not be miraculous. The miracle may consist in merely being the serendipitous concommitance of environmental circumstances that permitted the image to form by some as yet unknown natural process, in other words, more providential than miraculous. I can take the point that the image is not that of a risen glorified Christ, but is of a very dead body at a particular moment of time. I see the only evidence of resurrection as being that: Here we have what appears to be a genuine burial cloth, withour a body, yet with an image of an uncorrupted body that had to be formed within 48 hours of death. The body could not have been removed by manual means, as otherwise there would be evidence of smearing and tearing because of the glutinous substances on the cloth (e.g. myrrh). That is adequate enough evidence for me personally. We do not know if it is a normal process or not, as in other cases, any such image would probably disappear as a result of the chemistry of the corruption processes.  \nThe most successful attempts at forming an image by experimental processes to date are 12 years of experiments by Giovanna De Liso in connection with seismic events, probably associated with the concurrent release of mildly radioactive radon gas.\n“Shroud-like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010.\nhttp://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf\nThere have been follow-up papers to De Liso’s work by other authors.\n\n","date":"April 22, 2013 at 4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/21/john-klotz-new-quantum-christ-blog/","cat":"image_theory","title":"John Klotz’ new Quantum Christ Blog"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I’m only open to the possibility.

But as Helmut points out, the limbs would lose their temperature faster than the trunk, and the resulting intensity of the image would vary across the cloth, not what we see.  \nThe dorsal image is pretty well as distinct as the frontal image, and the buttocks are not flattened by the weight of the body.  Max Patrick Hamon claims to explain this by asserting that the body was lying on its side.  We then have a problem with the flow of the gases.  Because of the fairly high resolution of the image and its orthogonality on the cloth, some envisage that the body is lying on its back and with the higher temperature of the body, the gases flow vertically upward.  But this would not explain the clarity of the dorsal image.  Inconsistency builds on inconsistency.  We do not even know if Maillard is capable of producing a distinct image.  \nThe Jospice mattress image was said by Fr Francis O’Leary to have been formed on a nylon (not linen) mattress cloth through a sheet and a thin polyurethane cover, together with pillow and pillow slips, possibly a pyjama top.  But possibly O’Leary may have been misinformed about this and perhaps Les (the corpse) had been left lying on a bare mattress by a busy and overworked hospice staff.  Note that the Jospice image is a dorsal image, and Les had not been a traumatised victim as was TSM.  \nBut we have to start somewhere, and Dennis Mannix’ proposal is probably as good as can be done at this stage.

As I’ve often mentioned previously on this blog, the most successful attempts to produce credible images that I know of are by Giovanna De Liso working for 12 years in the seismically active area of Piedmont. Earthquakes release a heavy, mildly radioactive, chemically inert gas, radon, and possibly the radioactivity of radon is needed for Maillard to produce an image. Recall that the gospel accounts relate that an earthquake occurred immediately after the crucifixion. I have yet to be persuaded that Maillard is indeed the answer, although Barrie claims he saw signs of similarity at the microscopic level. The only way that Maillard can be conclusively proven or disproven to my way of thinking, is to run an experiment with several traumatised lab rats or other small animals, with a full range of controlled environmental variables. The question of how the linen has been processed and treated also needs to conform with the ancient method. If such an experiment failed to produce a credible image, then other hypotheses, perhaps involving seismic activity, need to be seriously considered.\n\n","date":"May 17, 2013 at 11:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/17/more-support-for-treasures-decoded-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"More support for Treasures Decoded: The Turin Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“Engineers who have done a course on Bible are not exactly qualified to write on religion”  What a load of B.S!  \nDoes Louis hold a major from any Religious Studies department from any university which encompasses the religious experience of most of mankind as I do?

Much as I might be tempted to respond in kind, no difficult task, I prefer to refrain from doing so.  However I shall not let pass his comments on a technical matter, viz:- \n“Not long ago he claimed that the gospel of Matthew was written for gentiles and when I had to show him that he was wrong he took my comments, rehashed them and posted it immediately in the same thread, trying to pass them off as his own research. That was when I had to tell him what he was doing.”  Louis, Nov 16, 8:06 am above. \nI certainly had no cause to rehash any such of his comments, but the technical aspect is far more complex.  Thus Encyclopedia Britannica for instance notes that in may ways, Matthew’s is the most Jewish of the gospels, but it identifies the target audience as Greek-speaking gentile Christians.  \nThus on the gospel’s origin:\n“The Gospel grew out of a “school” led by a man with considerable knowledge of Jewish ways of teaching and interpretation. This is suggested by the many ways in which Matthew is related to Judaism. It is in some ways the most “Jewish” Gospel. Striking are 11 “formula quotations” (“This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet . . .”) claiming the fulfilment of Old Testament messianic prophecies.”  (Etc)\nHowever on the Matthean church it comments:\n“Matthew is not only an original Greek document, but its addressees are Greek-speaking Gentile Christians. By the time of the Gospel According to Matthew, there had been a relatively smooth and mild transition into a Gentile Christian milieu. The setting could be Syria, but hardly Antioch, where the Pauline mission had sharpened the theological issues far beyond what seems to be the case in Matthew.”  … …\n“For Matthew, there had already been a separation of Christianity from its Jewish matrix. When he speaks about the “scribes and the Pharisees,” he thinks of the synagogue “across the street” from the now primarily Gentile church. Christianity is presented as superior to Judaism even in regard to the Law and its ethical demands.”\n“The Matthean church is conscious of its Jewish origins but also of a great difference in that it is permeated with an eschatological perspective, seeing itself not only as participating in the suffering of Christ (as in Mark) but also as functioning even in the face of persecution while patiently—but eagerly—awaiting the Parousia. ”  Etc. \nThis is clearly no rehash of Louis’ comments but is a particular view expressed in a highly reputable reference source.  Clearly also, not all Biblical scholars might agree with this particular view.  For them they may consider it is indeed addressed to a church of Jewish Christians, because of the Jewish flavour of the text.  But that does not seem to be the view of the majority.  \nBiblical scholarship is a hotly debated discipline, even among the best of its scholars. so clearly discerning unanimity is a difficult matter.  It is certainly more complex than Louis might prefer to believe.  His persistent obsessive carping against myself I shall let pass, considering it for the most part to be trivia, preferring instead to deal with issues rather than personalities.  And there, I think I shall let it rest.\n\n","date":"November 16, 2015 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/13/nevertheless-the-images-are-real-enough/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nevertheless, the images are real enough!"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis is not a scientist, but a journalist, and I don’t believe he fully understands the complex scientific issues involved.

However others prefer to explore scientific explanations first, if only to exclude them before coming to such a conclusion.  \nHis comment that De Liso’s work can only apply if the Shroud is a forgery is in fact what makes no sense at all.

Her work was directed at ascertaining the possibility of a naturalistic explanation of the origin of an image within a 1st century tomb, not at whether the idea might have occurred to a medieval forger.  She makes the explicit point that such imagery was only ever obtained under certain very specific conditions and was not merely the usual expected product of every general seismic event during her 12 years of field experiments.  \nIt may just be conceivable that such imagery might have occurred with dozens of burial cloths in 1st century Jerusalem, but by the time anyone ever thought to unwrap a shroud to place the bones in an ossuary, any such imagery would have been long defaced by corruption.  This could not happen with the Shroud of Jesus, because of the fact of his resurrection, and a decision to vacate his linen wrapping within days of his death.  \nAll four gospels mention an earthquake following the crucifixion, Matthew even attributing an after-shock to the moving of the entrance stone.  This suggests that it was a real event and not merely a literary device of the evangelists. \nA critic would see some shortcomings and unfortunate omissions in De Liso’s paper, and there is much more about her experiments that would be good to know.  Unfortunately, there seems to have been little follow-up or development of her work, and those who may have been associated with it seem to have gone off on tangents with their lasers, corona discharges, bodily emission of neutrons and other miraculist theories.  \nAs wise men have often observed, it is the most difficult thing in the world to get a new idea accepted, and the pedestrian preference is to cling to familiar paths even when well-worn or else to venture into the speculative or outlandish.  Such seems to be the case with the apparent lack of follow-up to De Liso’s seismic investigations into Shroud-like imagery.  But it might just yield an answer lying dormant and waiting to be discovered.\n\n","date":"November 13, 2015 at 3:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/13/nevertheless-the-images-are-real-enough/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nevertheless, the images are real enough!"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Colin, thank you for responding to the issue in such detail.

It so happens that this peculiarity of the wrist is well-known to lawn-bowlers, as they need to be aware of it to obtain accuracy in bowling to their chosen line.  There is a natural limit to how far the hand can be twisted outwards, but inwardly no problem. \nIn a good image of the Shroud (e.g. Shroud 2) there is a narrow band immediately around the hands which does not seem to be imaged.  The narrowest part of my wrists (back of hand to palm) is 5 cm.  If I cross them one over the other, that’s 10 cm and clearly beyond the approx 4 cm which others have asserted is the range within which imaging can occur.  So the fact that there’s no image around the crossed hands is to be expected.  However the non-imaged band is itself quite a narrow one, and the belly is certainly visible.  \nA number of reasons have been asserted as to why the thumbs are not visible.  Barbet asserted that his experiments in driving a nail through the wrist of amputated hands resulted in severing the median nerve so that the thumb reflexed into the palm.  Zugibe asserted that the thumb in the palm was in its natural position anyway.  So a contact-only theory is not necessary for the thumb. \nI have mentioned elsewhere that it is pretty well impossible to obtain perfect contact between a real fabric and any object which has 3 dimensional curvature.  It can only succeed to the extent that there is sufficient give or stretch in the fabric, which even for real fabrics is quite limited unless it is rubber or lycra or some-such, and certainly linen is quite limited.  We could only expect contact at the high points of the object.  But that is not the case with the Shroud image, where there certainly seems to be a small air gap across which imaging still succeeded in occurring.\n\n","date":"July 19, 2014 at 8:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/17/nutellagraph-did-sturp-check-for-nutella-and-butter-knife-strokes/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nutellagraph?

A brief tribute to Fr Rinaldi’s work, together with a URL ref to the article can be found at:\nhttp://johnklotz.blogspot.co.nz/2012/12/rev-peter-rinaldi-apostle-of-shroud.html \nHis article was probably responsible for arousing the first interest in USA for the relic. The suggestion of a naturalistic explanation had the advantage of removing Shroud interest from the confines of the Woowoo brigade and arousing scientific interest, with the consequence that we now know a great deal more about it than before. \nO.K’s suggestion that it is necessary to suspend the Laws of Thermodynamics, and that the image is as likely as a swimming pool freezing over in the summer heat, is I believe unnecessary. This is demonstrated by the fact that one De Liso has been successful in showing that it is possible for images to be formed under certain specific conditions. This then raises the possibility that images may also be formed under certain other specific conditions. \nIf say the image is the result of some kind of gaseous diffusion process, then it is possible to conjecture that conditions might be so controlled as to produce a distinct clear image of the object, together with its 3-D information:- if the flow is laminar and not diffuse; if there is a collimating influence on the molecules, such as by mild radiation or some electro-magnetic effect; if image-forming molecules undergo a chemical change in proportion to the path length. For the scientifically-minded, I can recommend checking out some flow-net theory, experiments and diagrams in any engineering undergraduate Fluid Mechanics text. I was involved in some rather convincing flow-net laboratory experiments during my early engineering training. \nIn response to Andy Weiss: My comments are to refer him to my suggestion concerning a multi-variate experiment with small laboratory animals.

Prometheanism places mankind in the place of God. Hesiod relates two versions of the Greek Titan Prometheus, the supreme artisan, who tricked Zeus and stole the secret of fire. For his impudence, Zeus had Prometheus chained to a rock where an eagle ate his immortal liver which constantly replenished itself. Behind the Genesis myth of the Fall of Adam lies the serpent’s voice “You will become like gods!” \nZeus’s eagle continues to chew at the liver of modern scientists, dissatisfied, laboring to unravel the secrets of the universe, to become omniscient like the deity. It chewed at the liver of Albert Einstein until his death, as he hoped to discover the logic and rationality behind the mysteries of the quantum, expecting to derive a Great Unified Theory. But it was Schrodinger’s cat who had the last word. There was no logic behind the quantum, only probabilities and the mystery of entanglement! \nThere may be a natural explanation for the image on the Shroud. But it will only come with a much greater concerted effort that hitherto. There are two major problems hindering solution of the puzzle: that of resources, and the problem of accessibility to this major relic, protected by its guardians.  \nA major experimental project is required. I’ve previously suggested a multi-variate experiment involving small laboratory animals, with linen cloths treated in various ways, and they can be loosely draped or tightly wrapped, with and without ancient burial herbs and spices. \nIt is not sufficient to obtain one-off small ambiguous stains, or to conduct one-off amateurish porcine experiments for the sake of some media sensationalism. A clear and unambigious image of a real object must be obtained to claim any kind of success. \nThe most successful results I’m so far aware of are those of Giovanna de Liso over a 12 year period, in relation to her seismic experiments near Piedmont. But they are subject to carping criticisms and much more is required. \nWould the effort be worthwhile? Clearly there are animal ethical issues involved. Is it so important that an answer be found?

Or shall it remain a mystery?\n\n","date":"August 30, 2013 at 5:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/30/of-inexplicable-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of inexplicable explanations"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It’s more than just a “nice interesting THEORY”, Matthias. Nobody, not even Yannick Clement (who apparently doesn’t believe in earthquakes) has ever been able to point me to any more persuasive or successful images on linen, than those obtained by De Liso! All anyone else seems to have ever achieved are a few ambiguous stains, never a coherent image of any specific object. A major criticism against the Resurrection causing the image, (often mentioned by Yannick) is that the image is that of a very dead corpse apparently in a type of rigor mortis, NOT that of a risen glorified Christ, and NOT even in transition towards Resurrection! \nYou may believe the Resurrection caused it if you prefer that explanation, however, such belief does not make it a necessary truth, for the simple reason that all other reasonable avenues remain unexplored. The most rigorous forum for proof of a miracle is the Vatican Causes for Saints, and they are certainly silent in this particular case. \nI tend to the view that it may be what can be technically called a “secondary miracle”. In a “primary miracle”, Providence intervenes to suspend the usual Laws of Nature to bring about some wondrous event, such as the otherwise unexplainable complete cure from a disease usually considered fatal.  In a “secondary miracle” the Laws of Nature are not suspended, but come together in such a remarkable way, that the result is seen as an Act of Providence.\nIt is generally thought unusual for an image to form on a burial shroud, but then nobody ever looks at such shrouds before decomposition sets in to see whether it is usual for these images to form or not.  More likely, if the Shroud image does have a natural cause, then it is probably as a result of some rare combination of environmental factors which may include: temperature, humidity, ambient light, the types of burial herbs and spices, variations in the geomagnetic and electric fields, perhaps accentuated by iron-bearing rocks, and just possibly the release of radioactive gases during an earthquake. Whatever the rare combination of factors might have been, perhaps it could be seen as a Providential Act.  \nUntil a concerted effort has been made, such as the multi-variate experiments I’ve suggested, then natural causes cannot be ruled out, even if they are the result or coming together of some rare serendipity, perhaps an Act of Providence.\n\n","date":"August 31, 2013 at 7:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/30/of-inexplicable-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of inexplicable explanations"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks for this, Dan, it clears up a lot of questions that have been in my mind.

It is certainly easier to realise this in a contact process analogy, but the same image reversal would occur even with action at a distance, as indeed occurs with a mirror. \nI was able to give a simple demonstration of this property to a small audience last March, using the simple props of a towel, some cut-out patterns of red cloth emulating blood-stains and some velcro spots attached to the towel.  Positioning the “stains” in the appropriate places on my body and attaching them to the towel, it became clear that everything became reversed. \nColin has made the further point that the strongest imaging is likely to occur for body areas closest to the cloth, while more distant areas will not be imaged so readily, hence we also obtain the light-dark reversal as well. \nThe notion that the image is caused by sweat is very ancient.  It is contained or implied in various versions of the Abgar legend, and the Catholic Encyclopedia in commenting on the Veronica legend acknowledges that the Abgar story is likely the source of the Veronica story.  It would seem that legends attached to the Image of Edessa were projected onto its various copies so it seems there was no shortage of images said to be “made not by human hands”.  The notion that sweat caused the image is echoed in the record of the viewing of the Mandylion by Constantine Porphyrogennetos and the Lecapeni.  It also seems to have been the impression of St Francis de Sales concerning the Shroud image as quoted above.  \nThe notion that sweat caused the TS image was even postulated by Paul Vignon in his earliest theories, although he later discarded it.  We see some echo of it in Ray Rogers’ imaging experiments with ammonia and even in his Maillard hypothesis.  \nAfter all this, what else might be said about the negativity of the image.  Perhaps not a great deal.  The imaging simulations by Jumper and Jackson persuaded them to assert that the imaging could occur up to a distance of perhaps 4 cm from the cloth, and they obtained some impressive 3-D impressions as a result.  The light-dark reversal would still occur, but would be graduated rather than either / or, that is a one or a zero.  A contact process is not an essential process for the negativity property.\n\n","date":"July 31, 2014 at 7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/31/okay-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-used-the-word-significant/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Okay, maybe I shouldn’t have used the word ‘Significant’"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Daniel Scavone has an interesting angle on the D’Arcis memorandum in a paper he presented to the Ohio conference in 2008: BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400.  Rather than Ian Wilson’s Knights Templar theory, Scavone postulates that the Burgundian Othon de la Roche, who was Seigneur of Athens from 1204, sent the Shroud to his church St Stephens in Besancon.  It so happens that Jeanne de Vergy, widow of Geoffrey de Charnay was a direct descendant of Othon.

I’ve always thought it curious that in Anglophone countries anyway, those who had a first degree in medecine claimed the title ‘Doctor’, and are usually referred to as ‘doctors’, whereas those of them who had qualified in surgery were given the apparently more prestigious title of ‘Mister’. With any amount of luck, we might have no further ‘ad homs’ in this posting thread anyway. \nThe apparent absence of flattening of the buttocks on the TS image, might be explained by the image being formed while on its side. Max evidently has a theory about it being corroborated by an ‘off-elbow-tipped bloodstain’. We might then expect that gravity might displace the hand position from off-centre but that’s not what is seen. The lack of hand displacement could be explained by body being set in rigor mortis. But that also might conceivably explain why there is no buttocks flattening. Or there would be no such flattening if the image were formed with the body suspended in mid-air conceivably during the Resurrection, or else supported at the extremities by two stones. Hypotheses, speculations, theories, but sadly we lack any kind of real knowledge about the image formation process. \nBack to the “anthropometric analysis” by Fanti, Marinelli, Cagnazzo at the head of this posting: I would call it a brave effort, but I personally do not find it too convincing, as demonstrating that the tibia/femur ratio, for example, demonstrates that the TSM was Jewish, possibly consistent with, perhaps – but not persuasive. The reported error margins are too broad, and the tolerance ratios in the ethnic tables are not shown, nor is the source for them even cited. One reservation I have is that an error in measurement can result from a limb’s angular displacement at right angles to the cloth. It only requires an angle of 18deg, for an apparent shortening of 5%, which would skew the results. Essentially there are too many underlying assumptions that have to be made in any such analysis, to attain conclusive results.

A Synoptic gospel merely says he “bought a Shroud”, but maybe that’s just shorthand. Passover that year was very special as it fell on the sabbath, and Preparation day may well have been a public holiday, and maybe the Jerusalem market had closed early. In the afternoon the paschal lambs were already being slaughtered at the temple.  One explanation might be that it was originally intended as Joseph’s own personal Shroud, which would have befitted his station.  Van der Hoeven made a speculative case for it being John Mark’s temple garment that he dropped in the garden at Gethsemane; then picked up by one of the guards, and given to Pilate. When Joseph sought permission to claim the body, he was then able to reclaim it for a burial cloth. As I said, “speculative”. Alternatively, it may have been Joseph’s own temple garment. There does seem to be a problem in how such an expensive cloth could have been acquired at such short notice on that day, and why such an expensive cloth was used for that purpose.

In 1665 he went to Florence, where he was appointed physician to the grand duke Ferdinand II.  He travelled extensively in Italy and had his first opportunity to observe the layered geology of limestone there.   \nHis seminal work on geology “De Solido …” is a pioneering milestone in the literature of geology, and laid the foundations for crystallography.  In addition he proposed the revolutionary idea that fossils are the remains of ancient living organisms and that many rocks are the result of sedimentation.\nSteno was the first to realize that the Earth’s crust contains a chronological history of geologic events and that the history may be deciphered by careful study of the strata and fossils. He rejected the idea that mountains grow like trees, proposing instead that they are formed by alterations of the Earth’s crust. Steno put forth still another idea—that layered rocks were likely to be deposited horizontally. Therefore, even though the strata of Tuscany were (and still are) displayed in anything but simple geometries, Steno’s elucidation of these fundamental principles relating to the formation of stratified rock made it possible to work out not only superpositional relationships within rock sequences but also the relative age of each layer. \nThe prevalent idea among eminent men of science, was the view that these fossil shells grew in the rocks, or that they were relics from Noah’s flood, certainly well into the 18th century – and their insistence that the world was only 6000 years old.  \nWhat Galileo did to Aristotle’s Physics, Steno did to Galen’s Anatomy, theories we find peculiar today.  Coming from the featureless landscape of Denmark, he became fascinated with the petrified shells in the mountains of Florence and the Swiss Alps.  His “De Solido” outlines his theories of stratigraphy; He had promised a more comprehensive work but this does not seemed to have happened.  \nMy point is that the case of Steno is a classic instance where men of science exposed to a revolutionary idea, can themselves obstruct the propagation of truth by adherence to old fixed dogma, that this appears to be a human failing, and is certainly not an exclusive failing of religious adherents.  The back-biting within science is what drove Steno away from it, and to adopt an almost eremetical lifestyle.  What else might he have achieved, had he found the scientific environment rather more open-minded and sympathetic to his ideas?\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/scorched-by-god-a-hymn-for-this-sunday/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorched by God?

You can add to that the unevenness of the bleaching of the fibres, suggesting an ancient age for the cloth. \nThen the only question I think worth pursuing is “What is the process whereby the image was formed from a dead body?”, assuming that a naturalistic explanation is available. Dan commented on Maillard plus “something else” mentioning earthquakes. This I take it is a ref to Giovanna De Liso’s 12 years with seismic experiments in Piedmont. Seismic variations in the geo-magnetic and electric fields, the release of radioactive radon gas, and the presence of iron-bearing rocks all seemed to have had some bearing on the matter, whenever she succeeded in obtaining an image. I know of no other natural process that has come anywhere near obtaining the successful images that she achieved, minor as they may seem. The gospel accounts all refer to seismic activity at the time of the crucifixion, and prior to the resurrection. Whatever the evangelists made of the event, I don’t believe it was intended as a mere literary device. \nI think it unfortunate, that apart from De Liso’s work that there appears to have been very little follow-through on this aspect of the image-forming process, as it may well provide the key to the answer. It may not attract the attention of scientists in seismic quiescent zones, totally unfamiliar with earthquakes. However, within the “ring of fire” they are all too familiar to us as a common enough occurrence. It may be of interest that the release of radon gas in USA apartment buildings has been implicated as a significant non-tobacco cause of cancer, it is that common!

Its first documented appearance is in his 1888 book  “L’atmosphère: météorologie populaire” (“The Atmosphere: Popular Meteorology”). The engraving has often, but erroneously, been referred to as a woodcut. It has been used to represent a supposedly medieval cosmology, including a flat earth bounded by a solid and opaque sky, or firmament, and also as a metaphorical illustration of either the scientific or the mystical quests for knowledge. Not all the elements of the original are clearly shown here. In particular the “wheel within a wheel” is not clear, and which seems to be a reference to a passage in Ezekiel. The pilgrim pushing his staff through the edge of the firmament may be a reference to Simplicius’ commentary on Aristotle’s Physics.

The myth of this memorandum seems to be a concoction by a liberal wing within the Catholic Church around 1905, which sought to discredit the authenticity of the Shroud, following Secondo Pia’s photography which seemed to lend support to the conservative orthodox belief that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical person, rather than merely a mythical legend. It is unlikely that the memorandum proceeded past the draft stage, and Pope Clement is unlikely ever to have seen it. If there is any truth at all in the matter, it is quite likely that the cloth the subject of the D’Arcis complaint was in fact a painted copy commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original Shroud which she rescued from the church at Besancon and kept before the church’s destruction by fire, and orginally placed there by her ancestor Othon de la Roche after plundering it from Constantinople and taking it to Athens. \nRe D’Arcis memorandum: “THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE SHROUD”; By Jack Markwardt; Copyright 2001; Examines Chevalier & Thurston’s attempt to misrepresent D’Arcis memorandum.\n http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n55part3.pdf \nRe Shroud & Besancon:  “BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE\nMISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400” by Daniel Scavone, University of Southern Indiana, 2008;\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers.htm\n\n","date":"March 17, 2013 at 5:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"That’s a lot of lemons to spread over a cloth of 8m^2.

They are therefore not perfect, but I consider them to be more than merely persuasive, considering the scientific status of those involved. \nI described the circumstances leading up to the discovery, at my comment above on Sept 26, 6:40am.  The limestone crystals were found embedded as part of the dirt around the soles of the feet image during the 1978 spectroscopy examination by Roger & Marty Gilbert, as I’ve described.  Apparently at some time, similar dirt was also found at the tip of the nose and on the knee-cap, as if from a fall.  I am unaware if this dirt was analysed in the same way as was the foot dirt by Kohlbeck & Levi-Setti.  But it would be surprising if it were any different. \nAs also noted elsewhere, Eugenia Nitowski sent some nine or so limestone samples from around Jerusalem to Kohlbeck.  A close match was obtained from the limestone tomb site, including similar concentrations of iron and strontium.  The matching was not exact, partly because the Shroud samples were also contaminated by flax.  The spectrographs are reproduced in the Barta & Bracaglia summary on the holyshroudguild site.    \nYou would be aware that aragonite form of CaCO3 is quite distinct from the calcite form, is rarer, and is apparently precipitated from springs.

Sam Pellicori examining the area under his microscope identified it as dirt. \nSubsequently it was also found at the tip of the nose and the knee-cap (not the elbow).  Rogers took sticky tape samples and later referred them to Dr Joseph Kohlbeck, an optical crystallographer for Hercules Aerospace in Utah.  Kohlbeck noticed the limestone particles among other material on the tapes.  He persuaded archaeologist Eugenia Nitowski to send him samples of limestone from Jerusalem.  Kohlbeck identified the limestone as travertine aragonite, deposited from springs and is formed under much rarer conditions than ordinary calcite.  Kohlbeck selected a Shroud sample from the foot as it had the greatest concentration of limestone (This sounds like more than just a single crystal).  Kohlbeck identified the sample as the same aragonite as sent from Jerusalem, with the same concentrations of strontium and iron.  \nKohlbeck took both samples to Dr Ricrdo Levi-Setti of the University of Chicago’s Enrico Fermi Institute. Levi-Setti’s equipment included a then state-of-the-art scanning ion microprobe.  There was an unusually close match.  Some disparity was due to flax particles embedded in the Shroud’s limestone.  \nIan Wilson viewed the Shroud in 1973 and also in 2000 under much more favourable conditions in clear daylight.  He reports that in 2000, even with the unaided eye, significantly more dirt was clearly visible at the sole of the foot than anywhere else on the cloth, and furthermore the dirt convincingly underlay the serum-haloed bloodstains that otherwise coat the same soles.   \nIt would seem that this notional artist using a gesso base, not only had the remarkable insight to give his subject dirty feet, muddy his knee-cap as if from a fall, and give him a dirty nose as well, he had the prescience to select travertine aragonite for the purpose, from somewhere in Europe of a similar variety that by happenstance coincided with that at Jerusalem.

Daniel Scavone in a paper with the title “The Missing Years” covering the 13th & 14th centuries, notes that Besançon in Burgundy was then a target for the German Empire, with its pro-Roman pontiff sympathies.  The Vergy-De Charnay families were French and preferred the claims of the anti-pope in Avignon.  He proposes that Jeanne de Vergy rescued the Shroud from Besançon to save it for France.  When St Stephen’s church was restored after the fire, the Besançon clergy sought to retrieve  their Shroud, but by then there had been a succession of bishops and no-one there recalled the original.  Jeanne de Vergy arranged to replace it with a copy, and this may have been the basis of the confusion of Bishop Pierre D’Arcis in his complaints that the Lirey Shroud had been painted and was not the true Shroud.

The Shroud image can provide one such basis for a rational faith, in that here is a burial cloth but without a body, and with an image that corresponds to the gospel accounts of Christ’s crucfixion, and yet with no signs of corruption.

My record of notes taken:\nVeronica:  Father Heinrich Pfeiffer, Jesuit and Professor of Iconology and History of Christian Art at the Gregorian University of Rome, thinks the veil of Manoppello is the Roman Veronica. According to the historic reconstruction, Veronica, called “acheiropoietos”, reached Constantinople in VI century (coming from Jerusalem and then from Camelia, in Cappadocia). It stayed there until 705, when it disappeared mysteriously, perhaps to save it from the iconoclastic movements of the time. It was in Rome under Pope Gregorio; after several vicissitudes, it was carried into St Peter’s Cathedral, becoming an important destination for thousands pilgrims. After the demolition of the chapel where Veronica was held, in 1608, no trace of the veil was found. The veil appeared in Manoppello is thought to be the historic and legendary Veronica.  \nItalian chronicler Matteo Villani reported that the Veronica was exhibited in Rome in 1350, and from Christmas to Easter there were constantly around 1 million pilgrims.  So clearly it was rediscovered after its being hidden from iconoclasts in 705, assuming it was indeed the same object.  Colin’s comments about attracting pilgrim tourists would seem to be to the point.  \nManoppello Veil:  According to the tradition based on a historic account written by Father Donato from Bomba in 1640, it arrived in Manoppello on an unknown day in the year 1506, when the physicist and astrologer Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, while was talking with some people, met a foreign man. He was invited to follow him into the Church. He received a mysterious wrapped veil. He should have taken care of the mysterious object. In return he would have got material and spiritual advantages. While Father Donato was unrolling the veil, thus discovering the image of Christ, the foreign man disappeared.  \nIt might seem a reasonable conjecture then that sometime before 1608, possibly as early as 1506, the Veronica veil was uplifted from its place in the chapel, and soon afterwards disposed of in Manoppello by a person unknown, for what reasons can only be surmised. \nOne plausible reason that occurs to me, is that the perpetrator may well have thought he was doing a holy deed and saving the relic from a corrupt papal court.  The saintly Savanorola had been executed (hanged and burnt) in 1498, and the Borgia Pope Alexander VI had died only in 1503.  The year of the relic’s alleged arrival in Manoppello 1506 seems suggestive.  Its subsequent history is hardly edifying.  \nFr Donato’s 1640 chronicle continues: From 1506, the veil stayed at the Leonelli family for almost one hundred years; but in 1608 the several heirs started to contend for it. Pancrazio Petrucci, a soldier, one of the heirs’ husband (Marzia Leonelli’s husband), carried the veil away with force. Since that day the Leonelli family started falling down. Pancrazio was arrested and imprisoned in Chieti; his wife was forced to sell the precious veil to Donantonio De Fabritiis in order to free her husband.  As De Fabritiis was not well, he showed the veil to the Capuchin Friars to verify the real value of the veil. \nThe Friars were happy with that relic and put it inside a frame (today you can still see it) in order to protect the veil. In 1683 De Fabritiis gave it to the Capuchin Friars who showed the relic for the public veneration in 1646, after the notarization.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2014 at 4:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/18/the-conspiracy-of-the-faux-sweat-imprint/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Conspiracy of the Faux-Sweat Imprint"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"NZers are well-known for pulling beyond our weight, even though we’re not all named Rutherford.

However it is evident that the image is confined only to the crowns  of the thread and not elsewhere, such as the valleys and interstices.  \nIn medieval times, to obtain a more uniform colour, the practice grew, particularly in the Low Countries, of postponing bleaching to after weaving of the cloth, which was then spread out in the fields to dry.  Under that scenario, the evaporation would then more likely concentrate the film to be confined to the crowns.  If the image resides only on a film, as postulated by Rogers, then that would tend to suggest that the whole cloth would have been bleached, rather than the hanks of yarn.  \nAdler et al, seemed unable to detect any such film layer, and therefore postulated that the image resided on the PCW.   An alternative postulate would be that the reason for image concentration on the crowns would be the result of some kind of quasi-contact process.  \nSummarising, if the image resides in a film, as postulated by Rogers, then its concentration would tend to suggest a medieval provenance;  If it is on the PCW, then a kind of contact process would seem to be involved.  There has to be a reason why the image is confined to the crowns.\n\n","date":"July 23, 2015 at 3:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/the-morphing-of-rogers-and-berry/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Morphing of Rogers and Berry?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis’ queries re Scavone’s paper: I think they are dealt with in the paper which should be referred to in the URL reference I have given. \n“…no reason to inform the Roman Pope…”; pp4-5, “Theodore Angelos, brother of Michael, Despot of Epirus, wrote to Pope Innocent III, complaining that the Shroud of Jesus had been taken to Athens.” … “In 1205 Pope Innocent III was still threatening to excommunicate the leaders of the western crusading forces for the looting of Christian Constantinople.” Etc. I should be interested to learn if any Crusader leader provided a Pope with inventories of the several relics looted from Constantinople. \n“…there were yawning gaps that had not been filled …”: Scavone makes it clear that this is sadly inevitable, due to the destruction of records. We can only proceed by intelligent speculation based on what evidence still remains. St Stephen’s Cathedral in Besancon was destroyed by fire in 1349. See p.13: “… local scholar Chifflet in 1624 knew nothing of Othon” – clearly the records if still surviving would have mentioned him. Concerning the destruction by French Revolutionaries in Besancon, archivist Gauthier wrote in 1901: “And when . . . the delegates of the departmental directory of Doubs\nthrew to the fire or shredded . . . all the administrative records of the diocese over four centuries . . . this destruction . . . reduced by about nine-tenths the sources of the Archbishopric . . . .

This independent province was the target of both German and French ambitions for its acquisition. The de Vergy family, descendants of de la Roche had French sympathies, and Scavone makes a good case for Jeanne de Vergy rescuing the Shroud before it was lost in the fire that destroyed the cathedral, and then took it to Lirey in France, where it became part of her dowry as second wife to Geoffray de Charnay. De Charnay himself never said how the Shroud came into his possession, and the Smyrna theory has little substance. \nScavone also suggests that one explanation for the infamous D’Arcy memorandum, is that when the cathedral was rebuilt, Jeanne arranged for a copy of the Shroud to be sent to Besancon to replace the original she had rescued. The relic was after all her family’s property acquired by her ancestor. D’Arcy may have mistakenly believed that the true Shroud was in Besancon, may have heard about the copy being made, and was perhaps confused by all this business.   \nIt is a difficult matter getting all the facts correct in any TV documentary, but deadlines have to be met, and as Barrie apparently commented to Dan, producers have sometimes to fall back on “creative editing”.

If Maillard is the principal action, then it clearly requires something else as well, specific environmental conditions and possibly some mechanism to collimate the gas particles such as radon seismic exhalations. \nRadon (Rn): 7.5 x heavier than air, decay product of radium. Rn-222 has a 3.823 day half-life, and emits alpha particles. Tubes of radon gas are used clinically as a source of penetrating gamma radiation resulting from decay product Bisthmuth-214.\nBy the late 1980s, naturally occurring radon gas had come to be recognized as a potentially serious health hazard. The gas, arising from soil and rocks, seeps through the foundations, basements, or piping of buildings and can accumulate in the air of houses that are poorly ventilated. Exposure to high concentrations of this radon over the course of many years can greatly increase the risk of developing lung cancer. Indeed, radon is now thought to be the single most important cause of lung cancer among nonsmokers in the United States. Radon levels are highest in homes built over geological formations that contain uranium mineral deposits. The gas is commonly released during seismic activity.

The diimide had removed the image coloration but had not affected the fibre which remained intact.  Rogers was therefore convinced that the chromophore lay in the starch coating, not on the PCW. He was also persuaded by this result that any kind of radiation hypothesis could not be sustained. \nThe further point was made that various attempts at producing coloration, whether by excimer laser, corona discharge, or scorching should therefore be carried out or repeated using Edgerton type cloth manufactured according to the ancient methods which would leave such a residual coating. If coloration of the coaing succeeded by any of these methods, then they should be treated with diimide to see whether the coloration was in fact limited to the coating, and whether the fibrils underneath remain unaffected, as was the TS sample. \nRogers had succeeded in coloring a sample of Edgerton cloth treated with dextrin and saponaria, and exposing it to ammonia for about 10 minutes. Coloration was produced within 24 hours.

Wilson had only two main arguments for this hypothesis: a) that the Master of Normandy was an earlier namesake of Geoffray de Charny, and b) the rumours (promoted by the inquisitors) that the Templars worshipped a head. Frale picked up Wilson’s hypothesis, claimed that she had discovered supporting evidence in her archival role at the Vatican, and made press statements to that effect. She appears to have badly misrepresented what she had claimed, and was quite unable to corroborate her claims when the matter was quite properly queried by Wilson who had first originated the idea. This is not the only time that Frale has demonstrated that she is unreliable in such matters, and I am a little perplexed that anyone can think she may have anything useful to say about any topic because of such unreliability. As it happens there are now other hypotheses, with more credible support, for the so-called missing years 1204-1355, involving Othon de la Roche and Jeanne de Vergy. \n2) The “Sudarium of Oviedo” is widely believed to have been the “cloth over the head rolled up in a separate place by itself” referred to in John 20:7-8. As the facial image on the Shroud is no less clear than the rest of the image, it would not seem to have been included in the burial. There has been discussion on this site as to what role it may have had. One idea had been that it served to conceal the face during the crucifixion to spare passers-by from witnessing the facial grimaces of the agony of the execution. However in view of the verses in John 19:25-30, it would seem unlikely to have been in place before death. Immediately before his death, He speaks to his mother and to John, and is offered vinegar. A more likely explanation seemed to me that it served to conceal the death rictus from passers-by during the portage to the tomb. However I recall that there has also been some comment on the differences in the blood stains which may shed more light on the matter, if it can be shown that the blood on the head cloth occurred before death or not.\n\n","date":"June 6, 2013 at 8:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/04/the-writing-on-the-shroud-a-stephen-jones-update/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The Writing on the Shroud:  A Stephen Jones Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I appreciate that Thibault’s posting is a response to counter CB’s assertions, and he’s made it clear enough, to this non-chemist anyway.

Further, if there is any such ill-rancour which I may or may not harbour, he himself has given me ample cause to provoke, with his frequent put-downs of me and anyone else who may differ from his favourite hypotheses.  Perhaps I ought to have drawn on Christian grace, and merely turned the other cheek.  I might have practised such heroic virtue if I had put my mind to it.  \nI feel I have made it clear enough, that my reservations concerning chemical and other such similar processes, arise from considerations of projective geometry, as I endeavoured to elucidate in comments #23 to #28 above in dialogue with Gabriel.  As I understand from hypothesis of MPH (and he may correct me if I have it wrong), he is claiming (1) the 3:1 twill was stretched when tightly wrapped and wet; (2) the amount of stretch was exactly sufficient to compensate in every respect for the distortion I have mentioned; (3) the base process of forming the image occurred at sometime when the linen was in this taut state; (4) when the linen was eventually freed from the corpse, it returned to its original unstretched state (possibly from drying?).  Consequently this yielded an undistorted image which has the approximate form which we might expect from an ordinary orthogonal aspect such as a photograph.  \nIf this is his hypothesis, he is welcome to it.  My personal views are that this is a very long shot indeed.  The cloth would need to stretch by about 40%, very roughly something just less than (pi/2 – 1), although a better calculation could be made by considering a roughly elliptical body section.  The cloth would then need to shrink back from this ~40% distension close to its original shape.  Further, assuming a constant strain rate within the cloth, distortion would still be apparent because of the variable angle of incidence or contact. \nI can suggest a very simple pilot experiment MPH could try if he is so-minded.  It requires a deformable metal barrel of whatever size suits him, which he can form into the rough cross-section of the model of a human torso.  He can then paint different coloured stripes equally spaced around the barrel (He could use a mannequin if he wants).  He can then wet his cloth however he may, then endeavour to stretch it to the required 40%, and wrap it around the barrel while the paint is still wet.  Carefully remove the cloth, wait until it returns to its original shape, (assuming it’s not permanently stretched) and see what pattern gets imprinted on the cloth.  If he is correct in his hypothesis, then an orthogonal projection of the pattern on the barrel (say a photograph) should conform closely to the imprinted pattern on the cloth!  I rather hope for his sake that he might have some success with it if he does attempt it, but I rather fear that he may well be disappointed!  I also fear that he may discover some obscure objections to this somewhat simple experiment.\n\n","date":"August 15, 2012 at 7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"As a footnote to my suggested experiment at #57, here is what I expect the results would be:\nA: Photograph of the barrel (or mannequin):  The equally-spaced stripes around the simulated torso will appear in the photograph to be more closely spaced at both outer edges due to a simple principle of projective geometry, which any Tech Drawing 101 student can understand.\nB: The imprint of the stripes on the cloth however will I expect show a different picture.  If by some freak of textile elasticity, it should happen to return to its original width, then it may be that the distance of the outermost stripes might match the lateral distance on the torso.  However I would expect that the spacing between the stripes will be very roughly uniform across the cloth, but with some minor variation due to random permanent non-elastic strains within the cloth,\nC:  The experiment could only claim to be a success, if on the cloth, the outermost stripes were more closely spaced than the inner-most stripes, corresponding to the apparent spacing of the stripes in the photograph.\nThe only way that there can be strict correspondence between the residual stripes on the cloth, and the picture of the stripes on the torso, is if the dorsal and frontal models of the torso are each contained in ideal flat planes; But no real body has such a configuration.\nI hope this makes it clear why I consider there are valid objections to any kinds of chemical or contact process as an explanation of the Shroud image.

In nuclear power plants I understand that the rate of the reaction is controlled such as by inserting carbon rods into the reactor, and avoids the onset of the chain reaction which occurs in an uncontrolled nuclear explosion. So matter is only slowly converted into energy over the long life of the power plant. If we postulate that the mass of Christ’s human body was completly converted into energy over the brief interval of time during the Resurrection event, then a large amount of energy would have been released.  The suggestion has been raised on this site before by another correspondent. I don’t recall how many Giga- or Tera-Joules were calculated exactly, but it seems it would have devastated the city of Jerusalem and a fair bit of Palestine.

In his questioning comments on Quantum Mechanics, he refers to God as “The Old One”, and said that “God does not play dice!” which considering the probalistic nature of quantum mechaincs, is probably incorrect. Nevertheless it is suggestive of some kind of belief in a personal God. \nSpinoza was excommunicated from the Amsterdam synagogue in 1656, at about age 23, well before his philosophical ideas had fully developed. The reason for this dismissal seems to have been his generally unorthodox views. There was then in the 17th century a tendency and general mood for revolt against tradition and authority. Jewish leaders in Amsterdam were fearful that “heresies” might give offence in a country that did not yet regard the Jews as citizens.

A number of aspects struck me.  1) I felt the explanation was essentially speculative and theoretical but unsupported by any direct experimental evidence carried out by Rogers himself – he does not quote any experimental evidence to support his explanation.  2) Rogers clearly felt that there were many unknown aspects in the process he expounded, for example he seems to feel compromised by not knowing the density gradient of the amines between the skin and the cloth, although he believed the data was in possession of what he calls the “Body Farms”.  3) He comments that some of the amines are unstable, that image density was therefore dependent on path length, and so I get the impression that he probably thought that this was a factor in the 3D encoding of the image, which seems reasonable.  4) He dismisses ammonia as being a factor in the imaging process, saying that he is unaware of any ammoniac content in analysis of sweat. Nevertheless the only experiment I’m aware of that he carried out to produce coloration was by using ammonia. 5) He makes a most interesting observation on the spectral analysis of the image, which I feel gives the only present but strong evidence to date for his Maillard hypothesis. 6) He gives a credible explanation of why the hair and beard are imaged, although these do not yield corruption amines.   \nThe greatest weakness in the whole hypothesis I feel is the absence of any other kind of experimental evidence.  There are no experiments with any kind of dead body wrapped in any kind of treated linen, which has to be the crucible for the hypothesis. That is what is really needed, either to confirm it or reject it. I feel it is not enough for a scientist to hypothesise, he must provide the evidential proof, and that is what is lacking in Rogers’ various assertions, regardless of the theoretical soundness of his chemistry. \nBecause of the success of De Liso’s experiments, I continue to be of the view that seismic effects very likely have something to do with image production. Whether it is the effect of seismic mechanical shock, variations in geo-electro-magnetism, release of radon, presence of iron, or whatever, remains unknown. If they are relevant, they may still work in combination with Rogers’ Maillard explanation.   \nThere may or may not have been miraculous elements to it.  Whether these were merely the providential concomitant combination of essential environmental factors on a natural occurrence, or a more direct divine intervention, remains speculative.

Note that Rogers specifically excludes ammonia as the cause as it disperses too quickly.  I would agree that the theory at present is short on experimental evidence.  The theory is summarily set out on pp.1-2 of “ROGERS’ MAILLARD REACTION (etc)” by Thibault Heimburger in the side-panel link above.  To anyone unfamiliar with the workings of organic chemistry, even this summary can be heavy going.  \nRogers sees the Maillard reaction as a three-phase process. Essential to the theory is the slow formation of amines (staining vapours) of various sorts evolved from the surface of the body due to sweat and the initial decomposition.  The products are diverse and several. In the third phase of the reaction, the products undergo aldol condensation and polymerise into true melanoids.  I think that one of the strongest arguments favoring Rogers’ theory is that he can claim: “The spectral evidence from the Shroud indicates that the image is a complex mixture of melanoids.” If correct, I would see this as strong supporting evidence but would agree that it is insufficient by itself.

My hope is that this could help to better understand the MRH and hopefully to discuss step by step all the aspects on a more sound basis.” \nUnfortunately no dates are given to trace any transition in the progress of his thought, but this paper seems entirely quite self-consistent.

The most striking thing I consider supporting the hypothesis is that the image seems to be made up of melanoids (determined by spectral analysis), and this is the third phase of the process he outlines in the various amines reacting with the sugars (or starches?).\n\n","date":"May 12, 2014 at 6:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/05/to-yannick-on-science-and-philosophy/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Yannick on Science and Philosophy"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"O.K: Thank you for the images, particularly your 3-D attempt.

However the blood stains from the cap of thorns are visible there, the outline of the hair pretty well matches that on the frontal image, and on the better negatives the pigtail is clearly visible. \nThe closest I can get to describing what is seen is a quote from my post: “If two separate photographs were taken, say on large glass plates, at a scale of one-to-one, the first of the front of the body, and the second of the back of the body, then transferred onto a cloth so that they met at the crown, then the result would be very close to what we see on the Shroud, apart from minor distortions only.” \nHow this can come about based only on a naturalistic explanation escapes me.  If all the technology and a suitable model of the body were available to him, then an artist might be able to reproduce it with photographic glass plates in the way described. Otherwise I need to have recourse to a miraculous intervention. \nThe fact that the two images abut each other at the crown cannot be explained, even with attempting a graphics explanation.    \nIt is as if there was a time warp at the moment of image formation. One half of the cloth (section 1) is suddenly flattened, with the cloth’s midpoint level with the crown and the frontal image transferred. The second half of the cloth (section 2) is flattened, again with the cloth’s mid-point level with the crown, and the dorsal image transferred. That is as close as I can get to explaining how the two images can abut at the crown. \nDraping the cloth clear of the head might allow a naturalistic explanation only if there were a gap between the two images not less than about 30cm. But of course with the two images abutting, no gap is seen. \nEither a forger has been able to use something like the glass plate photography I’ve described, or the image has to be some kind of miraculous intervention.

All the types of Shroud fibers gave positive tests for only two elements, calcium and iron. However, these elements do not derive from the presence of iron oxides or calcium carbonates on the fibers in a binder, as positive tests are obtained without the need for prior acidic digestion. Therefore these elements can be considered as being coordinately covalently bound to the linen’s cellulosic structure. Other samples of old linens (and even modern “craft” linens) show the same type of results. Therefore the presence of these elements can be ascribed to chemistry arising during the manufacture of linen from flax, e.g., the retting process being carried out in naturally occurring ‘hard’ waters. Since these tests are ubiquitous and uniform for both body image and non-body image fibers, it demonstrates that the body image chromophore cannot be ascribed to the presence of a metallic element. It should be noted that none of the trace elements associated with iron of a mineral origin were detected.”  \nConclusive proof that the calcium present has nothing whatsoever to do with an applied gesso coating, but is directly associated with the retting process during extraction of the linen from the flax! \nGIVE IT UP, CHARLES!!\n\n","date":"July 19, 2015 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/18/those-gee-whizz-radiation-models/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Those Gee Whizz Radiation Models"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My qualifications lie elsewhere than in the field of forensic pathology, and so I rationally rely on a number of those who are so qualified.

Colin is persisting with his scorch theory, although I understand that the ENEA team have ruled that one out.  I think he has yet to answer the question put by Dan (I paraphrase), “Can he or anyone else deliver a scorch mark that only penetrates the fibres by 200nm?” I can’t see how anyone before the 14th c would have the operational control to produce such a thin image.  We have never heard of a 14th c industry in generating scorched images.  If anyone had discovered such a method, they would have become medieval millionares .  But the Shroud is unique, and there’s nothing else like it, only painted copies!\n2. Any metal model, to produce a scorched image, would have to be life-size, and realistic, contrary to all other art forms of the time, and it would have to be of a crufixion victim in death, with all the features of the Shroud image. It would surely be a memorable object, but there’s no record of any such statue in all of art history.\n3.  Colin says the image would need to be by conduction and not radiation.  If it was by scorching, this would probably be true.  To scorch the image by radiating heat, it would need to be IR, but IR radiation has too long a wave length and would penetrate the fibres.  So it would have to be UV for 200nm penetration as ENEA found.  But Newton didn’t discover the light spectrum until the 17th c, and discovery of IR & UV came much later.\n4.  The model for the Shroud had to be human, a crucifixion victim and dead.  Corruption around the body orifices commences within 40 hours of death.  But there’s no sign of corruption apparent on the image.  Therefore the image was formed not more than 2 days after death and the body then removed.\n5. The identity of the crucifixion victim can only be Rabbi Yeshua (Jesus), as no other crucifixion victim was made to wear a crown of thorns, (mocking claims to be “King of the Jews”) apparent from the images of blood spots around the head, nor had his legs unbroken, scourged and pierced with a lance.\n6.  Contrariwise, there is a strong historical trail of at least one cloth with an image of Jesus dating no later than the 6th c.  But not even the clever Byzantines were in the scorched image business.  Surely that has to be “Checkmate!”\n\n","date":"February 8, 2012 at 11:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/08/why-do-we-think-the-resurrection-was-a-process-what-if-it-was-not/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process?

Dan, Colin’s lucid explanation of his low temperature (200C) thermal printing process, its requirements and effects has to be one of his better blogs on this site.  It’s a pity he had to add the ad hom rider describing ENEA as Mickey Mouse – it’s unnecessary and doesn’t help.  Some things that we might think are better left unsaid, if we want to win a logical argument!\n2. The next question has to be: “Does the thermal printing process he describes give the same RGB values as those on the Shroud?” That was one of the points that ENEA made, but it may require some fairly sophisticated spectroscopic analysis and equipment to measure this, probably beyond the resources outside of a physics laboratory. It might be possible with coloured filters.\n3.  Allowing that thermal printing would work with a metallic object, I doubt if I can be persuaded that the model for the Shroud was any kind of metallic statue.  It lacks a metallic look. It beggars belief that anyone, even an enthusiastic relic forger, would ever commission such an object, which would be even more impressive than its mere image on a cloth,  Despite the achievements of classic Greek statuary, there was not the knowledge available to reproduce the anatomical accuracy of the crucifixion victim on the Shroud. There’s no record of such an impressive object!\n4.  The third question therefore has to be: “Will low temperature thermal printing work with an organic object?”  It would need to be a good deal less than 200C, (which would sizzle a beef steak); 100C would cause blisters!  Can a thermal printing of an organic object be produced in under two days?  Can it be carried out with a laboratory rat for example? Dried flora will produce an image under pressure eventually, but it takes a very long time.\n5.  And all of this is without even mentioning the accuracy of the blood flows, wrist nailing and its effects, contamination from dust, pollen and cotton, the historical record, and everything else that makes the Shroud so unique, for those of us who have had the open-minded patience and dedication to be so informed.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2012 at 7:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/08/why-do-we-think-the-resurrection-was-a-process-what-if-it-was-not/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process?

I’m guessing that his “late ancient Greek version” probably refers to the Constantinople “Textus Receptus”.  Earliest full text is Codex Vaticanus with C Sinaiticus a close second, both 4th c.  There are several earlier fragments, mainly Alexandrian or possibly Coptic. There are also Syriac versions. Early canons of scripture were being formulated by about 200AD.\n2.  We need to remember that it was the day before a very special sabbath, as in that year  Passover fell on this sabbath (April 28, 30 AD according to John P Meier’s reckoning – “A Marginal Jew”),  The gospels say that Joseph of Arimathea went to Pilate to beg the body of Jesus in the evening, so that the sabbath had virtually begun already.  The burial work had therefore to be done hastily, including purchase of a shroud.\n3.  The Synoptics all say that the Galillee women witnessed the burial.  Earliest gospel Mark has Mary Magdalen and Mary mother of James purchasing spices on Sunday morning to annoint him, corroborated by Luke who has the women going off to prepare spices.  If he was already tied up as Max asserts, why would the women do such a thing, unless they merely intended making up for some missed ritual.\n4.  Only the latest gospel John has Nicodemus coming with Joseph, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds (a fairly weighty concoction).  John says they toook the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices, and adds the gloss “following the Jewish burial custom”.  Maybe this gloss was added to satisfy his Jewish readers, and perhaps we should not read too much into it.\n5.  If in their haste, the 100 lb of spices were laid over the shrouded body, instead of being wrapped with the body, I wonder if this would create enough pressure to produce a thermal image described by Colin.  It might explain why the women returned on the Sunday morning to complete the work. Alternatively if the body was wrapped tight in a water soaked sheet as proposed by Max, would this create enough pressure.\n6.  Maybe we should accept that it was some kind of miracle, after all.  Some aspects we can definitely know, some we may know in time;  others we can guess as probably true, or have an opinion on.  But there remain aspects where we can only ever say “We do not know, and never will!”\n\n","date":"February 9, 2012 at 5:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/08/why-do-we-think-the-resurrection-was-a-process-what-if-it-was-not/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process?

You’d be assuming that the only reactants, (presumably chemical, possibly physical) would be a moistened linen cloth and a myrrhic-aleotic concotion; you’d be saying that an image might be formed by their mere close contact with any geometric interface.  Even a photograph requires photons impacting on the subject and we can’t be talking photons here.  You’d be ignoring the possible effects of body emanations, gases and fluids, which might well be involved if there’s anything in this theory.\nI think the best bet would be to try it out on laboratory rats or rabbits first, they might need to be partly shaved of their fur.  My translation says Nicodemus brought 100 pounds of his mixture.  Assuming it was all intended just for the one burial (which seems a very large amount) that would be about 40% of the body weight for modelling purposes.  What about the two thieves who were also executed?  To comply with the required rituals, maybe some of the concoction was also intended for them as well,  In which case it might only be 13% of the body weight.\nIncidentally, do we know if there are any balsam/gum/resin (myrrh) and aloe residues on the Shroud?

We can’t know that the prescription was precisely followed in all its strict detail in this case.  Rabbi Yeshua himself, in his teachings, seemed disposed to dispense with the full rigor of the Law.  E.g. He seemed to differentiate between that given by Moses (Leviticus), and those aspects which seem to be later add-ons.  He touched lepers, he cured on the sabbath, and allowed his disciples to garner corn on the sabbath, he associated with all sorts of doubtful persons, publicans, prostitutes and other sinners.\nBUT, supporting your principal assertion that creation of the image may not have been a Resurrection phenomenon, check out the following 1997 paper, if you’re not already aware of it:  “The Image Formation Mechanism on the Shroud of Turin: A Solar Reflex Radiation Model (the Optical Aspect)” by Serge N. Mouraviev.\nYou can find it at: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/mouraviev.pdf\nI’m presently unaware of any reviews of the paper (perhaps you’ve come across it before), so can’t comment on its credibility.\nMouraviev’s main thesis is that the myrrhic-aleotic mixture made the linen photo-sensitive, and that the wrapping was done in the open, in the full light of the afternoon sun.  The sun’s parallel rays penetrated the translucent shroud, were reflected off the moist sweaty, bloodied body and absorbed by the photo-sensitive interior layer.  He carried out a few elementary experiments, obtaining some blurry images which he claims supports this thesis.  There’s much more, including obtaining a 3-D aspect.  He asserts that the body was laid on its back, which gave its frontal image, and then turned over to give the dorsal image.  It accounts for why there is no lateral image, and why there are minor discrepancies between both images.  In other words, two separate images were formed.  The relative movement of the sun during these operations, would have little effect in blurring the image.\nIt shoud be possible to simulate a small-scale experiment in the lab using a suitable light source for the sun.  If he’s correct, you don’t need a full-scale model, but the model does need a reflective surface.\nOne reservation is that M’s experiments gave blurry results, but the Shroud image is sharp.\nI’d be interested in any comments on Mouraviev’s paper.\n\n","date":"February 13, 2012 at 4:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/08/why-do-we-think-the-resurrection-was-a-process-what-if-it-was-not/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think the Resurrection was a process?

Earthquakes release radon gas, which has a half-life of 3.8 days, with very many daughter products.  Most of the gamma radiation comes from the decay product 214-Bi.  It would not be a great amount. \nAny X-ray-like properties of the image are only slight, and seem to be limited to the teeth and the phalanges, perhaps there are a few others.  The cloth around the teeth and fingers would need to be examined and perhaps there may be clues of slight gamma ray damage there.  But we do not know.  \n222-Radon has very many decay products, some of them other isotopes of Radon, but they are very short-lived, most with half-lifes of less than 1 hour.  Whether there would be any terahertz radiation resulting from this process, and what its results might be, I do not know.  I find it difficult to obtain detailed technical information on the process, most of the radon web-pages only being focused on health issues.   Alpha and beta particles are also generated by the decay, and perhaps had some role in the process.  \nAlthough the amounts involved would be quite small, I am saying that radiation may still  have had some significant effect on forming the image without undue damage, but it is not necessarily the primary cause.\n\n","date":"May 20, 2015 at 7:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I should think that the idea of X-rays originating from within bones is improbable.  I suspect that there may well be good reasons why radon gas might be the source of some X-ray-like features of the Shroud image.  Radon is far more prevalent than is generally realised, and there is quite a good Wiki article on radon.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon#Scientific  \nMost web-pages on radon seem to concentrate on the health issues, and it can be difficult to find some useful scientific info.  222Rn is a decay product of radium with a half-life of 3.8 days.  While 222Rn itself is an inert gas, some of its very many daughter decay products (other Rn isotypes) are solid, typically adhering to dust particles in the air, but have very short half-lifes, most of them less than 1 hour.  \nThe dominant radiation from 222Rn is alpha, helium nucleii, which travel only a short distance and are not penetrating.  There is some beta (free electrons) which may travel a few feet.  However there is also some gamma radiation, which could result in X-ray-like imagery.  The low energy of the gamma, may explain why the TS X-ray-like imagery is limited to a few areas only, notably the teeth and finger phalanges.  The gamma emission of 222Rn is sufficient to have been used for treatment of cancer cells.  \nExtract from Wiki article:\n“Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily used to treat cancers. The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and beta radiations, while allowing the gamma rays to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200 MBq). The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short-lived elements of its decay chain (218Po, 214Pb, 214Bi, 214Po).” \nMost radon seems to originate from within igneous and metamorphic rocks, but also to a lesser extent in sedimentary, including limestones and shales.  It has also been associated with caves and springs.  Note that aragonite limestone as occurs in Jerusalem, is commonly associated with caves and springs.  \nIf radon has been a factor in forming the TS image, is it conceivable that the heavier, short-distance alpha particles might have had some kind of collimating effect in whatever particulates produced the TS image, and might even account for the orthogonality of the image?  \nI am wondering if there may be much more in the significance of Matthew’s reporting of an earthquake (which releases radon) at the time of the crucifixion, than others have seem prepared to acknowledge.  It does not require a catastrophic earthquake, but only a moderate one of about R.5.0 .  We have a few of these every year in New Zealand, a little disturbing at the time, but we get used to it.\n\n","date":"May 20, 2015 at 5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Piero, Thank you for your posting on natural body radiation,  particularly from 40-K. \nYou write: ” …  the dose rate from these gamma rays outside of the individual’s body will represent a very small fraction of the normal background dose rate from all natural sources outside the body.”  I have read that most of the background radiation is due to radon.  \nAn earthquake will release radon from within the earth.  I think it may be this radon from an earthquake that might account for some of the X-ray attributes of the Shroud image.  You will be familiar with work of Giovanna de Liso, who investigated seismic effects in Piedmont and produced a few images on cloth.  She only obtained images under very specific circumstances, and this included only when radon was released.  \nYou also write: “There is one other very minor mechanism by which the human body acts as a source of radiation: some of the gamma rays emitted by the radionuclides in the environment interact with the atoms in our bodies by what is known as the photoelectric effect. The result is the emission of x rays by these atoms. …” \nI also note that in posting above Giles Carter says: “My hypothesis for that is that higher energy x-rays which are more penetrating emanated from the bones of this individual and passed through the skin and at the surface of the skin interacted with elements such as sodium and chlorine from salts and chloride on the surface or from sulfur or phosphorous in the skin. And these elements then, like sodium and chlorine, gave off secondary x-rays which are very low in energy and not penetrating at all. And it’s these x-rays that actually caused most of the image, or all of the image, of the Shroud.”  \nI do not believe it is necessary for high energy X-rays to emanate from the bones of the person, which requires a miracle.  But I wonder if it is possible that the radon emissions from within the earth might have reacted with the body salts to produce the same effect.\n\n","date":"May 21, 2015 at 2:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I disagree.

Alternatively the rays may have stimulated a secondary radiation on the body salts.

The same technology was in use, with some minor differences, until after the last crusade in 1291 (Hochberg, 1980). Linen was spun by hand on a spindle whorl. When the spindle was full, the spinner made a hank of thread. Each hank of thread was bleached separately, and each was a little different. Different parts of the same thread in the shroud’s weave show slightly different colours, like a variegated yarn. The warp thread was protected with starch during the weaving process, making the cloth stiff. The final cloth was washed in a solution made from Saponaria officinalis. Saponaria produces four glycosidic saponins, and all hydrolyse to produce sugar chains. (Ya Chirva et al., 1969) The following carbohydrates were identified in those chains: galactose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, fucose, rhamnose, and glucuronic acid.” \n“The presence of starch, in particular amilose, on the shroud was confirmed by the fact that during testing for sulfoproteins in blood areas with an iodine-azide reagent (which bubbles vigorously when sulfur is present), a reddish background was formed. Image colour does not appear under the bloodstains when they are removed with a proteolytic enzyme.  Whatever process produced the image, colour must have occurred after the blood flowed onto (or was painted onto) the cloth, and the image-producing process did not destroy the blood (Heller and Adler, 1981).”  \nNote that the authors are asserting that several carbohydrates, including some sugars, were identified, and also amilose, which I take to be a starch.  Authors also cite Heller & Adler regarding blood-stains.  Searching on “starch” on shroud.com web-site results in several other papers.\n\n","date":"May 22, 2015 at 9:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I do not preclude the Shroud image as miraculous.

It covers Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Greeks, Romans, Orientals and the European medevals and has a section on the cathedrals.  I still have it.  It is now a little dated by more recent archaeology, but is nevertheless still an entertaining and informative read.  I googled and was delighted to see it’s still in print.  \nIt shows somethng of an agnostic streak.  I remember he mentions one Heron, a near-contemporary of Jesus, who had invented a vessel that gave an illusion of turning water into wine.  Whether this invention was behind Luke’s gospel story about Cana, who can say?  It has a good section on the great Library of Alexandria and tells the story of its origins and its progressive decline during 100 – 400 AD, apparently partly due to fanatical desert monks under St Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria..  It was then that the centre of learning shifted to Baghdad, and the Arab surge in mathematics, and also ensured that at least some of the ancient classics survived, although much was lost.  \nThe medieval engineers still had very little theoretical knowledge of structural mechanics.  Their building work was essentially trial and error, even the flying buttresses.  Cathedrals typically took a hundred years or so to complete, and there were many structural failures during construction with significant loss of workmen’s lives.  Nevertheless the ancients were also highly inventive.  \nPick up a copy if you can, as it’s both informative and entertaining.  As for the Shroud,, it would be beyond their technology and I’d have to agree with Chris’s comment, that it would be well and truly overkill for its time if it were either Byzantine or Medieval.

It is more scientific to express resolution as a ratio or an angle.  Thus the normal human eye has a limiting resolution of about 2 minutes of arc.  Yet distance units are given.  Does this mean that no image on the cloth is more distinct than half a centimetre across – I doubt it – the eyes for example clearly have better definition than 5mm.  Some have claimed to discern lettering on coins say 1mm.  Yet other parts of the body are quite indistinct.  Clearly the question of resolution is not a constant across the cloth, but it varies, and its pointless to ascertain a single value as applying to the whole cloth.

The decalogue section seems a little disjointed from the flow of the main Exodus narrative here.  \n“You shall not make yourself a carved image or any likeness of anything in heaven or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them.

Israel was surrounded by pagan cultures, reliant on agriculture, and fertility cults were important. They included idolatry, infant sacrifice and temple prostitution to sustain life. They go some way towards explaining the intent of the commandment in banning such practices. Within Israel and later Judaism there were occasional bouts of iconoclasm, seen as a cleansing and a return to the essential prescriptions of Moses, notably by such as Hezekiah and Nehemiah, but they seldom lasted. Imagery persisted until the time of the Maccabees, which rejected any kind of images in worship, and crass idolatry. \nEssentially the ban is only a token of what ought to be in the peoples’ hearts, lip service only. Jesus makes it plainer. “You cannot serve God and Mammon” In other words, it is what is in the heart that matters, and nothing in the heart should displace the rightful position of God as the object of worship. Jesus made it clear that making possessions central to life, was also idolatry. Paul considered that idolatry was not as may be thought, a first step towards an evolutionary progress to monotheism, but he saw it as an apostasy from a natural religion which ought to marvel at the wonderful works of Creation – Romans 1:18-25. \nIf God has so ordered nature, that the cloth in which His only Son was buried in, should produce an image of Him for the benefit of His posterity and His people, then we should say Amen and give thanks, and not quibble about the motives of the Almighty.\n\n","date":"August 6, 2013 at 4:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/05/why-would-jesus-defy-the-2nd-commandment-and-create-a-graven-image-unto-himself/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why would Jesus defy the 2nd commandment and create a \"graven image\" unto himself?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I thought I would check on Barrie’s site, Hugh’s comment “although not necessarily involving an iron”.\nhttp://www.shroud.com/restored.htm\nprovides several experts’ comments on the 2002 ‘restoration’, nearly all extremely depressing.

I recall a contemporary who obtained his doctorate in an aspect of the subject in Auckland.  Prof Fanti has attempted to apply the methods of ‘Materials Science’ to a single minuscule fibre of the TS. However linen is a particularly variable material, see the article on Linen even in Wiki. Not only will its properties vary between different cloths obtained from different processing methods, but also between fibres within the same cloth, more so I would expect in ancient cloths because of hand processing, spinning etc. Fibres are extremely brittle, inelastic, will not stretch, and with frequent folding be inclined to break. Its softness increases with frequent washing. The different histories of individual cloths even from the same batch will increase the variability of their properties, so that these cloths from the same batch end up with different properties. \nWith this inherent variability, it is hardly surprising that Prof Fanti finds that there are large variabilities and scatter in his calibration curves.  To then make an assertion about the age of the TS based on one single solitary fibre is going beyond what I think is good science.  It is compounding the errors made in the lack of proper sampling protocols in the C14 fiasco. \nProviding that adequate sampling protocols have been followed in deriving the calibration curves, it may be possible to obtain a credible range for the age of the TS, but only if an adequate number of proper samples are tested from the TS.  However because of the inherent variability of linen cloths, their history and so on, a large error in any confidence interval would seem unavoidable in any age assessment.

In the case of scientific research on a religious relic such as the Shroud, the only product to sell is a philosophical stand-point, either the religious agenda that the object is authentic (Fanti’s position), or the agnostic viewpoint that all such relics are necssarily bogus. There are few with the integrity who can put their personal viewpoint in their back-pocket as Yannick might express it. It seems to be an unfortunate fact of the human condition and will continue to be the bane of those seeking the truth about this remarkable object. \nThe Rinaldi review of Fanti’s book is an excellent piece of work. The hypothesis that cellulose will degrade over time has much appeal and would in principle seem to be a rational proposition.  It may be significant that the original unmodified date placed an age on the TS fibre of 752 BC (+/-400 years). This must raise a serious doubt on the allegation that it is medieval, irrespective of the actual site source  of the fibre. The fact that anything on the Shroud can be attributed with such an age has to be significant. However it is also clear that there are many unsatisfactory or at least unknown aspects to the work, questions on the provenance of the fibre, the agenda-driven nature of the research, and some of the wilder assumptions made. I would add the inclusion of the Peruvian sample in deriving the calibration curve when it is known that South American flax is unrelated to Old World species. The variations in the individual histories of the fabrics would seem to have resulted in a wide scatter in deriving the calibration curve. \nDespite all these reservations, Fanti may well have hit on something worthwhile pursuing further. If ever there is further scientific work to be carried out on the TS at sometime in the future then this set of experiments should be included in the programme. At least it may give better results than the C14 tests that Gabriel has often queried as worthwhile on this type of object.\n\n","date":"April 5, 2013 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/05/a-committee-far-removed-from-padua/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Committee Far Removed from Padua"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Gabriel, Thanks for introducing me to Benford’s Law which I hadn’t come across before.

I found even the Wikipedia article amazing.  That it could have election fraud, and auditing applications makes it a potentially powerful tool, and I see that courts have accepted its use for persuasive evidence in cases of fraud.\nI suppose it’s fairly simple when you think about it.

Possibly Paul had in mind the diverse cults of gnosticism already then prevalent.  However it is true that it is a more prevalent and recurring tendency.   Later developments were Arianism, Monophysitism and Nestorianism, among many others. \n“The old gods die.”  The case of Ancient Britain is particularly interesting “The Sacred History of Britain” by Martin Palmer.  Agriculture reached Britain about 5000 BC, and the Neolithic peoples developed ceremonial burial rites and communal centres around ‘long barrows’, a particular example being at Waylands Smithy.  Overuse of farmlands led to crop failures, consequent famines and the barrows were closed off about 3200 BC.  It was succeeded in turn by the ‘Stone Circle’ culture, initially by wood-henges and eventually by stone circles which spread right across Europe.  With the building of the Great Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain in 3100 BC, the other stonehenges fell into disuse.  There were three distinct phases at Stonehenge, each being a falling into disuse, and then a remodelling.  In 1150 BC an Icelandic volcano erupted, blotting out the sun with widespread crop failures and famine, and the last attempt at remodelling Stonehenge remained unfinished and the circle culture with its ceremonial burials was abandoned.  From 500 BC Celtic ideas emerged focusing on springs and wells, originating from a Mesopotamian Ainu cult.  In turn it gave way to early forms of Christianity.   Palmer traces the religious development of Britain right up to modern times.  Community crises, famines, plagues, often resulted in changes in religious thinking. \nWe are seeing at present mass extinctions of species, the forerunner of yet another global crisis brought about by climate change.  It seems likely that antibiotics will also fail, and there will be a mass succumbing to incurable diseases with major impact on populations.  How humanity might eventually react to these crises can only be guessed at.    \nWhat will the Christianity of the future look like?  A remnant only, or a reawakening.  What will be the place of Islam?  Will it become dominant, or will it fail?

Did you know that most of the Eastern Orthodox do not even accept this book as canonical.  I spent the best part of a year discussing this specific book with my Bible Study group under a well-informed scholarly priest.  \nEssentially Revelations is an Apocalypse, as is the book of Daniel, both using similar imagery, and both written under threat of intense persecution.  Both have the specific purpose of encouragement to those threatened.  An apocalypse can work on a number of levels.  There is the immediate threat at the time of writing, and the style will be in the form of a simple code easily recognised by those for whom it is written, but so as to be hidden from the enemy.  Much of what is said of the beast applies specifically to Nero, including the number 666.  [Greek uses an alphabetic numerary system,]  \nHaving said that, an apocalypse may also contain certain cosmic truths which are forever perennial, and can apply to various extreme circumstances in history whenever God’s people are persecuted.  It is hardly a difficult matter to identify the beast with the likes of Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin for example.  It can equally apply to certain extreme forms of philosophy, involving exploitation of the weak and vulnerable, or in the consequences of selfishness.  I see the beast at work in the extinction of species, and in climate change, much of which is being brought about by human greed.  Indeed, sometimes we are our own worst enemy, and the enemy of our posterity.  \nI should not attempt to divine specific future events from it in any kind of literal way.  I think that is to misunderstand the function of prophecy and of the prophet.  The prophet is not an augur or an Oracle of Delphi but proclaims his message to the people of his time, although his message may also contain perennial truth.  The specific future remains hidden from our eyes, and we must be satisfied with the consolation of hope and the promise.  It is not for us to know the times that the Father has appointed.\n\n","date":"June 9, 2014 at 7:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/07/a-decline-an-uptick-and-a-rise/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Decline,  an Uptick and a Rise"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I imagine they haven’t yet been carbon dated.

He explains it very well.  It seemed to me it could be a stepping stone in coming to grips with the ideas implicit in the supernatural, which could find a response in the modern mind with our greater understanding of how the universe works.  Under modern avant-garde theories of matter involving string theory and M(membrane) theory, our universe comprises 3 dimensions of length, one of time, and several more which are supposed to be “rolled up” so we don’t directly perceive them.  Maybe there’s 10 or 12 of them.  In a parallel universe, these extra dimensions might not be rolled up, and it would appear very strange to us indeed, and the physical laws would be quite different.  \nThe main thing that I found attractive in Michio Kaku’s book, is his excellent treatment of so-called “Goldilocks zones”, which is the subject of his chapter 8, “A Designer Universe?”  You can find quite a lot about Goldilock Zones on the web and elsewhere.

Explanations of the causes of these processes depend on what perspective we adopt and out personal belief systems.  A purely spiritual approach, such as those by mystics and primal peoples, might explain them in such terms as the providence of God, or the Great Spirit, whereas an agnostic might explain them in terms of natural evolutionary development from some kind of primordial soup of organic matter.  Others, such as a modern informed religious person, could be prepared to accept some kind of synthesis including both viewpoints. \nIf parallel universes do in fact exist, then a religious person has to say that they are part of God’s creation.  It may be possible for some Being, an angel for example, to travel from one of these universes to another.  The Resurrection of Jesus might be seen as Jesus going to some kind of “super-universe” of which our present universe is but a component.  \nAn analogy is a flat two-dimensional table top which exists in our three dimensional space.  An ant crawling on the table-top has only a two dimensional perspective, with no up nor down, but we can reach out from our 3-D space and touch the ant.  In a similar way, Jesus may reach out from his super-universe and touch our lives.  God may be much closer to us than we can imagine.  \nThe evidence for parallel universes is scanty, but the concept could explain a few mysteries of quantum mechanics, such as super-symmetry and the spontaneous appearance of sub-atomic particles in perfect vacuums.  \nIt therefore seems to me that the concept might have some useful kind of role in a modern mind coming to terms with the existence or reality of the supernatural or spiritual world of the divine, in contrast to the materialists’ view of “All you can see, is all that exists – there is nothing else.”  \n“There are many rooms in my Father’s house; if there were not, I should have told you.” John 14:2\n\n","date":"July 11, 2012 at 5:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/11/a-modern-conceptual-idea-of-the-supernatural-world/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A modern conceptual idea of the \"supernatural\" world?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yet again, Yannick is misinterpreting what I have written and puts his own spin on the topic.

Unlike American Gridiron no sissy body-padding is worn, and head protection gear is not compulsory.  Also unlike the more popular Association Football played elsewhere, there is hard body tackling as players seek to capture the ball from their opponents.  Our international games commence with the posturing of the traditional haka, a war-dance of defiance which is how you will be welcomed to our Maori marae, and indeed you will be made very welcome if you pay the traditional ‘koha’, for it is a “quid pro quo” society and ‘utu’ is important.   At the club level, despite the bruising, and occasional more serious injuries, and even sometimes ill-tempered fisticuffs, the teams get together afterwards in camaraderie, the contest over, for a few beers and sing rowdy rugby songs.  A whistle-blowing referee controls the game to ensure compliance with the Laws. \nOur women folk also play a hard physical game of Netball against the Aussies and Jamaicans, and the ref’s whistling is even more frequent.  Some of us imagine we can play cricket, a gentlemanly game much less boisterous, but even there the umpire’s word is Law.  Our Parliamentary debates are also robust, and the House Speaker regularly sends the worst prima donnas out of the chamber for unparliamentary behaviour.\nA much rougher game is ‘Hardball’ where the rules of fair play are ignored and the only objective is to win at all costs.  One version of the game is to attack the credibility of the opponents, using whatever arguments you can dream up, and when they retaliate you can cry “Foul!” and the umpire or moderator then steps in.  You can play this as a long-term strategy, the pay-off being that more benign players no longer turn up for the next fixture, and you can eventually succeed in killing off the enjoyable discussions among those whose views differ from your own.  Another version is to resort to incomprehensible technical jargon, and when this fails to persuade, you can act aggrieved, taking it as a personal insult, the pay-off being that your ego has been massaged. \nI see no problems with using a pseudonym, as those who have wanted to contact me have always been able to do so, by leaving a message on the site.

You can find them on Wikipedia: XX Male Syndrome Wikipedia:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome  \nExtracts:\n“XX male syndrome (also called de la Chapelle syndrome, for a researcher who characterized it in 1972[1]) is a rare sex chromosomal disorder. Usually it is caused by unequal crossing over between X and Y chromosomes during meiosis in the father, which results in the X chromosome containing the normally-male SRY gene. When this X combines with a normal X from the mother during fertilization, the result is an XX male.\nThis syndrome occurs in approximately four or five in 100,000 individuals, making it less common than Klinefelter syndrome ” [XXY ,  There are also XXYY ]. \n“Symptoms usually include small testes and subjects are invariably sterile. Individuals with this condition sometimes have feminine characteristics, with varying degrees of gynecomastia but with no intra-abdominal Müllerian tissue.[4] According to research at the University of Oklahoma health science centers, most XX males are not stereotypically feminine and are typical boys and men[citation needed] although other reports suggest that facial hair growth is usually poor and libido is diminished, with notable exceptions.” \nThe article gives citations.  So it does occur!\nWhether it occurred in Jesus in this form, or whether he had some other chromosome arrangement, we have no way other way of knowing, except the papers commented on above.\nI still maintain there is a theological difficulty.  If Jesus had XY chromosomes, and that this was part of his human nature, then he had to obtain Y from a human father.  It still creates a theological difficulty if you say he had them from the Holy Spirit, as he is supposed to have his human nature solely from his mother.  \nDoctrine of the Virgin birth dates only from the 4th century.  The early doctors of the church postulated that Jesus’ brothers (named in Mark) and his sisters were from an earlier marriage by Joseph, or were cousins.  However, John P Meier, a highly reputable Catholic biblicist is insistent that the Greek word used for brothers means precisely that.  A further explanation, which I tend to favour is that they may well have been adopted, as adoption of orphans was very common in those days because of high mortality rates, and adoption gave exactly the same rights as birth, both in Roman and Jewish law.  \nYou may believe that the doctrine of the Virginal birth was metaphorical, and there are other non-Christian religious traditions also asserting that it occurred elsewhere, (e.g. Siddhartha Gautama = Buddha).  However, that metaphorical interpretation is not the intent of the Catholic doctrine.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2012 at 8:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/16/a-winning-shroud-of-turin-expository-speech/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Winning Shroud of Turin Expository Speech"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Not lunatic! Not incredible!  The mother of Jesus would normally have no XY chromosomes to pass on to her progeny.  I have heard that it is remotely and rarely possible for a woman to inherit and contain XY chromosomes from her father, but knowledgable medical geneticists may be able to supply more authoritative comment.\nThere is a “medical/theological” problem with doctrines of virgin births coupled with doctrines of incarnation.  The birth of Jesus is one such example, and in history of religions, there are also a few others.\nThe problem is this.  If Jesus was truly man, he must have had XY chromosomes, and the question is “Where did they come from?”.  The standard Catholic doctrine is that Jesus inherited all of his human nature from his mother.  But she could not normally provide XY chromosomes.  A liberal stance would be to deny the doctrine of the virgin birth.  This could not be accepted by Catholic theologians in good standing.\nIt seems that Mr Frank Tipler, is attempting to get around the problem, by asserting that Jesus only had XX chromosomes.  But only women have XX chromosomes.  And the logical conclusion from Tipler’s assertion would be that Jesus would therefore actually be a woman.  However there is a gospel account in Luke that Jesus was circumcised when he was about 8 days old.\nBut I don’t think that this would be an adequate reason for the Vatican to consider that it might now  permit the priestly ordination of women!\nThe doctrine of the Virgin birth was only formulated around the 4th century, and is derived from the gospels of Matthew and Luke.  The question is now: “When did Jesus become God?”  For Mark it was when he was baptised by John in the waters of the Jordan.  For both Matthew and Luke, it was at his conception.

No less so was Geoffroi II de Charnay.  The bailli Venderesse had a letter signed by Charles VI to retrieve the Shroud.  Who drafted this letter?  Had Charles actually bothered to read the letter or was it in a stack of “unimportant correspondence” for his routine signature?  At the very time that Venderesse was seeking to retrieve the Shroud from Lirey, Geoffroi II was in Paris with a celebratory party to mark the arrival of Isabel of Bavaria as preliminary for her coronation as Queen of France.  Geoffroi II took part in the joustings as did Charles VI himself, all a very cosy party for the lads and mates of the king.  And Venderesse was all too easily discouraged from his assigned mission, directed against a fellow bailli. \nD’Arcis himself may well have been confused about the matter.  He may have been aware that the genuine Shroud had perhaps once been in Besancon, and that there was said to be a shroud still there.  Unknown to him, this was the replacement shroud that had been painted and the poor fellow had probably confused one with the other, as the replacement had been done in secret. \nHe had his own interests and problems to think of as well.  Here the lucrative pilgrim tourist traffic was heading off to some little insignificant village church in Lirey, while his own seat was in a state of disrepair.  During the Christmas period in 1389, the entire nave of Troyes’ cathedral collapsed, and shortly afterwards the rose window of the north transept fell out.  D’Arcis had to hire 30 labourers just to clean up the mess.  A bishop needs to think of his priorities and where the money should be going. \nNow coming to the matter of the relationship between Antipope Clement VII and Geoffroi II:  Was it merely a question of disturbing a lucrative tourist trade of a relative, as David Mo would suggest, or were there in fact higher motives?  Is it not possible that Clement, as a family relative, in fact had inside knowledge of the true origins of the cloth that Geoffroi II was displaying? Did he know that in truth the Shroud had been captured from Constantinople, and that therefore there were rather bigger issues at stake.  On 5 January 1390, Clement sent his stern letter to Bishop D’Arcis.  On the same date, he sent a letter to Geoffroi II, stating that he could continue to hold the Shroud expositions, though he should limit the lavishness of the accompanying ceremonial.  There was not even any mention that Geoffroi II was required to describe the Shroud as a ‘figure or representation’ of Jesus’ shroud. \nDid Bishop D’Arcis send his memorandum to Clement VII with all its accusations against the de Charnay family?  I think not.  That is an invention of Ulysse Chevalier, echoed by his co-conspirator Herbert Thurston, who wrote lies for the Catholic Encyclopedia.  \nAs David Mo says, “To speculate is free”, but I think my own are closer to the mark!\n\n","date":"October 26, 2014 at 6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/accusations-of-intellectual-dishonesty/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Accusations of Intellectual Dishonesty"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Barbet provides a very rational explanation.

Unless the statement meets certain rigid criteria, it can I think be only given the same weight as any such statement by a well-informed Catholic theologian, and such statements are not necessarily deemed to be infallible.  \nThe doctrine of infallibility, officially defined at the Vatican I council of 1870, says that when the Pope is officially defining church dogma, the Holy Spirit is also. There are three  requirements for infallibility to be invoked:\n1.  The pronouncement must be made by the official successor to Peter.\n2.  The subject matter must be in the area of faith and morals.\n3.  The Pope must be speaking ex cathedra (from the chair) of Peter, and must be intending to proclaim a doctine that binds the entire Church to assent.\nIf any one of the above 3 requirements is missing, the papal declaration is not considered to be an infallible doctrine.  Not everything the Pope says is infallible.\nThus any Pope may consider the Shroud to be the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, or else he may prefer to refer it to as an icon, and he may write as such whatever.  As the matter is hardly to be considered one of “faith and morals” it is unlikely that even an official position would ever become binding as a matter of Catholic doctrine, regardless of whether the cloth’s authenticity be ever conclusively proved or not. In such matters, it is to be expected that the faithful will come to their own conclusions about where truth may rest according to how well they may be able to inform their individual consciences.  This implies a duty to become as well-informed as may be reasonable for the particular individual.\n\n","date":"April 9, 2013 at 7:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/09/an-important-distinction-in-catholic-theology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An important distinction in Catholic theology"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There is much that could be stated on the history of biblical criticism, too much to encapsulate here in a brief comment.  \nMuch of the New Testament itself includes an attempt to interpret the ancient scriptures in terms of the new Christianity, to see those who had accepted Jesus as Lord and Saviour as the new People of God, supplanting the exclusiveness of Judaism by extending salvation to the gentiles. \nIn the first few hundred years of Christianity, the patristic period, the preferred method of interpreting the scriptures seems to have been an allegorical approach (Clement & Origen in Alexandria).  Thus Origen claimed that the most meaningful aspects of divine revelation could be extracted only by allegorization, a view echoed by Clement. \nLater from about 350 AD, Theodore of Mopsuestia (c. 350-428/429) and John Chrysostom (c. 347-407), patriarch of Constantinople, developed an exegesis that took more account of literal meaning and historical context. But the allegorizers could claim that their method yielded lessons that, while arbitrary, were more relevant and interesting to ordinary Christians.   \nIn the West, the Alexandrian method was adopted by both Ambrose and Augustine.  Augustine, though not primarily an exegete, composed both literal and allegorical commentaries and expository homilies on many parts of Scripture, and his grasp of divine love as the essential element in revelation supplied a unifying hermeneutical principle that compensates for technical deficiencies.  Jerome paid close attention to the grammatical context, often appealing from the Greek Septuagint to the “Hebraic verity”.    \nThe scholastics made further progress during the medieval period.  Thus for Thomas Aquinas, the literal sense, expressing the author’s intention, was a fit object of scientific study; the figurative senses unfolded the divine intention.  There is much more that could be said on the contribution of the medievalists. \nThe Protestant Reformation, with its emphasis on scripture as the sole source of divine revelation could hardly have occurred without the contemporaneous invention of printing.  However both Luther and Calvin reverted to favouring the literal approach as that to be preferred against the allegorical.  Hence it is hardly surprising as a strategy that the first steps in modern biblical criticism to recover from this position were those by German Protestants. \nPerhaps the first steps were taken by Griesbach in 1776 who printed the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke in parallel columns, giving them the name synoptic.  Others also made their various contributions: Bengel, Lowth, Lachmann, Wellhausen and others.  \nMajor breakthroughs occurred at the start of the 20th century from both Schweitzer and Bultmann.  Butlmann in particular seems to have been particularly concerned at the apparent conflicts between science and religion, which he attributed to the mythological world view current at the time the scriptures were written, and which he saw as inessential to the fundamentals of faith, but which in the modern context masked it.  Other Protestant scholars followed on, such as Karl Barth with his existential approach.  \nThe Catholic response was much more slow, anchored as it was in the Greek Septuagint, as prevalent in New Testament times, and in Jerome’s Latin Vulgate.  Perhaps the first breakthrough occurred with the 1893 encyclical of Pope Leo XIII “Providentissimus Deus” ‘On the Study of Holy Scripture’.  There followed the war-time 1943 encyclical of Pope Pius XII “Divino Spiritu Afflante”, ‘ On Promoting Biblical Studies’.  Both encyclicals are reproduced in a 1955 Douay-Rheims translation I still hold of the Latin Vulgate.  I recall reading both encyclicals there as a young man.  Perhaps the greatest impetus and encouragement to modern Catholic Biblical Studies arose from the 1965 Vatican II Council document, “Dei Verbum” ‘On divine revelation’.  Thus the footnotes of the Jerusalem Bible version (a translation from French to English) provide a critical commentary in themselves for the general reader.\nCatholic scholars in biblical studies had a lot of catching up on their Protestant colleagues.  However in some quarters, it is now considered that they have well overtaken them.  \nAnd even yet I have said very little on the various types of criticism whether: textual, philological, literary, form, tradition or historical criticisms.  All are vast subjects in themselves.\n\n","date":"March 5, 2015 at 12:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/04/after-cnn/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"After CNN"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Concentrate, Colin, concentrate!\n\n","date":"April 9, 2013 at 3:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/09/an-important-distinction-in-catholic-theology/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An important distinction in Catholic theology"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Much of what is done is carried out on a part-time basis by voluntary enthusiasts, all with other priorities and life commitments.

These include American (N & S) native populations, Australian aborigines, NZ Maori and Hawaiian and a few others. However it has been asserted elsewhere that there have been about five reversions to Group O from mixed groups during the course of humanoid and human history. It is interesting for example that Group AB is now rare or absent among Maori and Polynesian populations notwithstanding that anthropologists trace the early origins of these peoples (about 3000 BC) to China where AB is currently 13% (Peking) 6% (Canton).

We have several Immigrants from India and Malaysia in our local parish in Wellington and elsewhere.  Some of them trace their Christianity back to the missionary efforts of St Thomas the apostle.  Xavier was particularly enlightened in his missionary efforts. He is justly credited for his idea that the missionary must adapt to the customs and language of the people he evangelizes, and for his advocation of an educated native clergy—initiatives not always followed by his successors.  His poverty that had so won the Paravas and Malays often repelled the Japanese, so he abandoned it for studied display when this was called for.  \nThere are now lively Christian communities in Japan and South Korea.  We have had Korean seminarians staying in some of our NZ parishes.  The church in China is a vexed question, essentially two Catholic churches, the state-sponsored one, excommunicated from Rome, and an underground church which is in communion.  Relations between the Chinese government and the Vatican remain somewhat strained.  There are tensions between Hindus and Christians in India.  A major obstacle to Christian missionary work in eastern countries is Islam.  A Moslem who converts to Christianity is likely to be persecuted and even martyred, even in Pakistan.  The state of the church in North Korea, is completely unknown, because of its oppressive government.\n\n","date":"August 31, 2012 at 7:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/31/another-jesus-survived-the-cross-legend-another-tomb-of-course/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Another Jesus Survived the Cross Legend: Another Tomb, of Course"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There is certainly a considerable amount of commentary available on the Argument from Ignorance.  Wikipedia cites Bertrand Russell’s over-simple example that no-one has proved that there is not a teapot (American readers may prefer a coffee percolator) orbiting the sun.  Therefore the argument from ignorance would say that there is in fact a teapot (coffee percolator) orbiting the sun.  However, the problem with this example is that there is no good reason for saying that this phenomenon occurs. \nTo say that the Shroud is authentic because no-one has proved that it is not, is I think, an insufficient argument by itself, and another more detailed analysis, or a different approach must be considered.  For example it might be argued that our technology is far superior to anything that was available in the fourteenth century, and if a 14th c. genius was capable of a technology that could create the Shroud, then a modern technologist would also be capable of creating the Shroud.  But we know of no technology that could create it; therefore it is HIGHLY UNLIKELY that there was a 14th c genius capable of creating it.  Futhermore, unlike the tea (coffee) pot example, there is strong circumstantial evidence why the Shroud may very well be authentic. \nThis will not satisfy the philosophic pedant, who will still say that the case has not been proven, and the reasonable Shroudie would then say PSHAW! to the pedant.  He would say that there are many aspects of life that we accept on merely reasonable grounds and circumstantial evidence, and that undue rigour is not required to sustain what is a reasonable belief.  \nIn the early 20th century, it was the objective of Russell & Whitehead to derive a rigorous and indisputable logical derivation for all of mathematics.  After some 300 pages of arcane Set theory, Russell was able to satisfy himself beyond any shadow of doubt whatever, that indeed he had proved that when one entity was added to one other entity, the answer was indeed two entities.  However the Russell/Whitehead project was doomed, and came to an abrupt end when Kurt Godel proved that within any rigorous mathematical system, there would be propositions within that system that could not  be proved.  The Russell/Whitehead symbolic logic system that they derived is now barely of antiquarian interest. \nAn analogous situation to Godel’s theorem also seems to occur in quantum physics.  Thus the philosophic assertion may be made, that unless a fact is observed, then there are no grounds for accepting that fact.  It was on some such grounds that Albert Einstein was most uncomfortable with the probabilistic approach that seemed so necessary to the laws of quantum physics.  He felt certain that there had to be underlying causative variables.  However there are no causative variables, they have never been discovered, and despite the so-called fallacy of the “argument from ignorance” it is asserted that they never will be!  \nI personally think that the Deity likes to have his little jokes with his creatures.  He seems to have wanted to teach Russell & Whitehead an important lesson in humility, and have said to Einstein, “Don’t tell Me what to do with My dice!”.  As far as the Shroud image is concerned, I think He may be saying, “Bet you can’t discover how I did it!”\n\n","date":"July 23, 2012 at 7:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/23/argumentum-ad-ignorantiam-mea-natibus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Argumentum ad Ignorantiam, mea natibus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Doctrine of Addai demonstrates that the principle of a visual aid in evangelisation was established very early indeed.

Nevertheless Avicius says that “Faith led him onward!” Is the Shroud Jesus’ love letter to humanity? Or is it his receipt for the cloth?

I considered that the contributions he made under the June 7 discussion under the heading of the Tilma of Guadalupe and the Veil of Manopello particularly worthwhile and made a point of saying so. But this did not satisfy him and he continued to harbour his resentments against me. Despite his extensive knowledge and particular specialist field, Mr Hamon needs to learn that the real world is not governed by specialists, irrespective of their particular expertise. It is governed by generalists, who if they are wise, will take due consideration of what experts may have to say, but without necessarily accepting it as gospel. Court histories are littered with any number of cases where alleged experts have been in violent disagreement on opposing sides and it is over to juries of ordinary persons with no specialist knowledge of their own to weigh the value of their evidence.

There is a considerable amount of detail about AAI already on the web, and there was little point on expanding on this.  My personal position is that I consider AAI, and indeed much of the pedantic rigorous type of philosophy is only of limited value in arriving at the truth of matters.  The Russell/Whitehead programme with its “logical positivism” was directed at developing a rigorous type of logical deduction.  There are clearly equally valid reasons, for a softer approach in coming to a rational belief as contrasted with the rigorous deducitve approach aimed at certain knowledge.  Much of reasonable human activity has as its basis, rational belief, without worrying about the baggage of rigorous logical deduction for every little matter that may occupy our minds.  Thus rational belief for most reasonable people is derived from the weight of circumstantial evidence as they may interpret it. \nThe limitations of the Rusell/Whitehead approach was effectively demonstrated following Russell’s massive work “Principia Mathematica” when Godel published his theorem of “undecidability”.  The uncertainties associated with Quantum Mechanics is another example demonstratinig the limits of certain knowledge.\n\n","date":"July 24, 2012 at 6:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/23/argumentum-ad-ignorantiam-mea-natibus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Argumentum ad Ignorantiam, mea natibus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I might observe that Galileo was not handed over to his enemies in the aristotelian-dominican-dominated Inquisition because of his comprehensive astronomical evidence and rational argument so much, as for his gross ingratitude in lampooning a hitherto admirer, friend, supporter and generous patron, Maffeo Cardinal Barberini, Pope Urban VIII, an enlightened and scientifically sympathetic pontiff, by assigning him the role of Simplicio in his Dialogue. Nevertheless, Urban exercised his prerogative of clemency to Galileo in setting aside the Inquisition’s sentence. Dr Hamon (if that is how he prefers to be so titled) might discover a valuable lesson in Galileo’s failure in human relations. \nGalileo’s own views on the relationship between scientific research and biblical interpretation have been endorsed by the Vatican since 1893. In 1979 Pope John Paul II reiterated this view and stated that Galileo had suffered injustice at the hands of the church. A statement by the pope before the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1992 is interpreted by some as a rehabilitation of Galileo. \nNevertheless, Johannes Kepler was never able to pursuade Galileo that planets moved in elliptical orbits rather than circles, as it seems that Galileo himself still retained some vestige of a Platonic idealism, rather than committing himself to the more accurate mathematical model devised by Kepler.   \nAs with Galileo, posterity may find that Dr Hamon is correct in his assertions (though lacking the same quality of evidence as Galileo’s), and then again it might just not.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 10:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/13/argumentum-ad-populum-of-the-day/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Argumentum ad populum of the day"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, Why don’t you give it a rest, and just concentrate on addressing issues, it’s getting just a little tiresome!\n\n","date":"June 14, 2013 at 4:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/13/argumentum-ad-populum-of-the-day/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Argumentum ad populum of the day"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Well, I think it’s all in your perception only.

Very many homes in the so-called red zone have been declared unsafe for further habitation, and many families have had to be rehoused elsewhere into the “green” zones. Many buildings in the CBD were condemned as unsafe and had to be demolished. \nIt is now early autumn in NZ, and climate change seemed to leave us without much of a summer to speak of. Today Ash Wednesday 2014, the city of Christchurch has been hit yet again, this time by an unseasonal 100 year storm which swept over the country from the Southern Ocean.  Christchurch received the worst of it, with many of the city’s streets turned into raging rivers by flooding.  There have been extensive land slips and the usual power outages.  It was once a beautiful city, referred to as the garden city of New Zealand.  It was originally set up by John Godley as a very English city, and its Anglican stone cathedral was a glorious piece of architecture, an icon of Christchurch, which has since had to be demolished. \nAsh Wednesday heralds the start of Lent, a time of penance, even with the reversal of the natural seasons in our southern hemisphere.

In a comprehensive standard text by Koontz & O’Donnell “Principles of Management”, as early as p.19, the authors include a section on the Roman Catholic Church when reviewing Early Contributions to Management Principles.  “If one is to judge by age, the most efficient formal organisation in the history of Western Civilization has been the Roman Catholic Church.”  They continue with comments on appeal of its objectives, effectiveness of its organization, and management techniques, hierarchy of authority, scalar territorial organization, specialization on functional lines, early use of the “staff device” etc, all imitated by  by other organizations, but only in latter years.  Other scholarly writers on the topic of organizations (e.g. Mooney) have also commented on the Catholic Church as an organization.  \nMeanwhile media speculations on the resignation of Pope Benedict continue to proliferate.

One does not have to go back to the case of Galileo to find such examples.  One simple case is in the Church’s attitude to the faithfuls’ study of Holy Scripture.  From the various Tridentine anathemas, there was a singular breakthrough in Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical Providentissumus Deus of 1893.  Breakthrough though it was, Pope Leo’s encyclical today still looks quaintly cautious.  Pius XII’s “Divino Afflante Spiritu” of 1943, addressed to all, gave further impetus to the promotion of Biblical studies.  The Vatican II document “Verbum Dei” on divine revelation bears little relationship to the counter-reformation Tridentine position.  The Pontifical Academy of Biblical Studies comes lately to their subject compared to Teutonic Protestant studies, but very likely have now surpassed them.  \nThere has been a similar evolution in doctrine concerning human reproduction from the more recent time.of Pius XII’s “Humani Generis” as recently as 1950.  \nI maintain that the Church’s present position on a solely male priesthood.is more likely based on certain anthropological considerations, than on any theological position,  Even today, many traditional patriarchally based societies would find a female priesthood difficult to accept.  One partiular difficulty is the tradition of certain pre-Christian religions in associating female roles in worship to that of temple prostitution.  However that tradition has no palce in cosideration of a proper role in the Christian priesthood.  St Paul’s Galations 3:28 makes it clear that there is to be no distinction between male and female, Jew or Gentile, freeman or slave, etc, but all are one in Christ, without distinction. \nI consider that it will only be a matter of time, and further development of doctrine, before we will eventually see an evolution towards acceptance of a female Roman Catholic priesthood, in those societies where it may be found acceptable.\n\n","date":"November 17, 2012 at 3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Female roles in the temple prostitution of Roman, Greek, Egyptian and other Middle Eastern religious practices, would have been well within the collective memory of the early Christian church, and may well explan why a female priesthood was at that time a non-starter.

The formulae of the words the evangelists put into His mouth very likely come from an early liturgical practice of the first Christians.  We do not know who else was or was not present,apart from the apostles.  Obviously someone had to set out the table and clean up afterrwards, and we can easily guess what gender they probably were.  It is not unreasonable that both Mary his mother, Mary Magdalen, and possibly other women were also present.  Being women, the evangelists would see no need to mention them. \nAfter the Resurrection and before His Ascension, He bresthes on them so they receive the Holy Spirit and He imparts the power to forgive sins.  Again we do not know who was present apart from the Apostles.  I suggest that in these cases, the evangelists silence is  insufficient to assert that any others were absent. \nThe Apostles’ laying on of hands to effect ordination is recorded in the Acts.  \nThe cultural attitude towards women can easily be adduced from a commentary by John Gill in relation to Gal 3:28: \n“The apostle’s design is to show the common right of believers, of every nation, condition, and sex, and to encourage the Gentiles, and demolish the pride, vanity, and boasting of the Jews, their men especially, who valued themselves upon these “three” very things which the apostle here makes no account of; as that they were Israelites and not Gentiles, freemen and not servants, men and not women; and in their public prayers they give thanks to God in this form,”\n“blessed be the Lord our God, the King of the world, that he hath made me an Israelite; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a Gentile; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a “servant”; blessed be the Lord who hath not made me a “woman”;”\ninstead of which last the woman say: “blessed be the Lord who hath made me as he pleased”  \nGill’s commentary, illustrates well the cultural attitude of male Jews towards women, and in my view goes a long way to explaining the evangelists’ and others’ silence about their roles in the early church, Jewish Christians in particular. Paul demonstrates a slightly more enlightened attitude.   I maintain that these are an inadequate reason for the Church in the 21st century to maintain a similar attitude.

The vote keeps the British church offside many other Anglican churches worldwide, including Canada, where women have been bishops since 1993.” Globe & Mail web-site.  \nMotion won required two-thirds majority in two groups – Bishops and House of Clergy – but failed by six votes among laity.  Proposition cannot be considered again until 2015.  \nNot only have women been bishops in Canada and elsewhere since 1993, but there have also been two women Anglican bishops in NZ, my earlier posting noted above.  \nConcerning apostolic succession debate above (Dan & Andy).  The Anglican Church traces its succession of the Archbisop of Canterbury back to its first bishop, St Augustine of Canterbury.  The Anglican Church in its history, has faced many conflicts between the Archbishop and Monarch in its history, including for example Thomas a Becket, and even Cardinal Wolsely vs Henry VIII.  – there have been others.  The last mentioned when Henry set himself as the Head of the Church in England resulted in a break with Rome. \nFollowing the Oxford movement in the 19th century, an attempt was made at rapprochement, when the validity of Anglican orders was examined in Rome.  The decision given by Pope Leo XIII in his encyclical Apostolicae Curae, was that during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and afterwards, there was a clear decision not to ordain priests for the purposes of consecrating the eucharist as practised in both the Roman and Eastern Orthodox churches.  It was considered that this constituted a break in the apostolic succession.  Very many examples could be given of the hunting down and execution of Roman Catholic priests, who deigned to celebrate Mass in various houses of the aristocracy many of whom still clung to the old religion.  By the time the Anglican Church resumed an acceptable FORM of the eucharist, it was considered that there were then no longer any validly consecrated Anglican bishops who had apostolic powers to ordain.  \nThe situation has since been further complicated by a number of Anglican bishops being consecrated by validly ordained Orthodox bishops as part of the consecrating group.  \nThe situation is therefore very much more complicated than Andy Weiss has asserted.  We can all hope and pray that there may come a time when both the Roman and Anglican churches may once again be in communion.  \nI note from the Globe & Mail posting mentioned above, that there are 3500 women Anglican priests worldwide.  Concerning Andy’s assertion that the arguments for women priests are entirely secular, I consider that the biblical text of Galatians 3:28 is a persuasive scriptural argument otherwise.  The tradition of a male priesthood I continue to maintain is based more on anthropogy that theology.  The argument that Christ was a male, is a specious argument at best.  A similar aversion to women in all sorts of professions has been  tradition in many male bastions, even mathematics.  One should read up on the histories of Hypatia, and Sophie Germaine to see the true source of male objections to women in such occupations.  Emmy Noether in the 1930s was considered by Albert Einstein to be the most significant mathematician since Isaac Newton.

Ordination of women is not to considered a valid option in the present church today.  However it has not been taught as an infallible doctrine of revelation and has not been issued as an “ex cathedra” doctrine.  Therefore, although it requires external observancy, I maintain that the issue may be intelligently debated, without necessarily falling into error.  It is not on the same level as for example questioning the divinity of Christ, which necessarily requires an internal assent to remain within the church. \n(2)  It is the tradition of the church that only men may be ordained, and therefore can never become a valid option!\nResponse:  Not all traditions of the church are immutable.  I maintain that this tradition is based on a human cultural tradition that subordinated women to men, as an anthropological phenomenon, and that the tradition has no sound basis in theology. Therefore this tradition may not be immutable.  \n(3) Christ chose the option to become a male human, and therefore only male priests can be true representatives of Christ in their priestly ministry.\nResponse:  In order to become fully human, the Son of God had to choose to become either male or female.  He might have chosen to become androidal or hermaphrodite, but then it would be argued that he would not be fully human, and that would be in error.  The cultural environment of 1st century Palestine demanded that he become male.  A woman in 1st century Palesine would be incapable of being any kind of religius leader, let alone even a rabbi.\nSt Paul’s teaching in Gal 3:28, shows that all are to be admitted to the life in Christ, that there is no more “male nor female”.  Here he is teaching theology.  Paul’s teaching concerning other female roles, his preference that they be silent in the assembly, that their heads be covered, are in the nature of discipline and are not of a theological nature. \n(4)  Christ never ordained women as part of his commissioning!\nResponse:  The gospels, written by men, record that Jesus called men to become his disciples.  Nevertheless, his attitude towards women was revolutionary in the extreme.  He debates with the Samaritan woman at the well, unheard of!  He defends the woman taken in adultery, discerns the men’s holtile motives, and prevents her being stoned, unheard of!  He allows a highly suspect woman to anoint his feet, over the Pharisees’ objections, unhear of!.\nHe commissions those at the Last Supper to observe his actions over the bread and wine as a memorial.  It is quite likely that women were also present, very likely in a subservient role as befitted their station in that cultural environment.  There were women at the foot of the cross after all the men had fled, with the sole exception of the disciple whom Jesus loved.  After his resurrection he imparts the power to forgive sins.  The gospels are silent on whether women were so commissioned or not, but if they were it is unlikely that the evangelists would make a point of saying so.  Women are present in the upper room when he presents himself as resurrected, and also when the Holy Spirit descends on those present at Pentecost.  He commsissions all to go forth and teach all nations his commandments. (He never said, “But don’t ordain any women!”)   It is Mary of Magdalen whom He first reveals himself as surviving the grave. \n(5)  John Bourgeous was disciplined for simulating the ordination of a woman, and this demonstrates the teaching of the church that women may not be ordained!\nResponse: I have discussed this at some length above.  Bourgeous was quite properly disciplined for this act of defiance against his superiors.  It still does not follow that this teaching is immutable. \nConclusion:  I await with some expectation that some other sound theological reason might be discovered, for prohibiting the ordination of women.  However I suspect that any such will be no less specious than those I have discussed above.\n\n","date":"November 21, 2012 at 8:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/bishop-justin-welby-chosen-to-lead-anglican-communion/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Bishop Justin Welby Chosen to Lead Anglican Communion"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis: “Thomas Cranmer was “evicted for heresy” ”  [DB note: s.b. “executed for heresy].\nCranmer succeeded William Warham as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1533; he determined to take the English Church down the Protestant road; he denied transubstantiation, and denied Papal church supremacy in England; and with Thomas Cromwell aided and abetted Henry VIII in his designs for the English church; He argued that Henry’s first marriage to Catherine of Aragon was invalid from its beginning; he devised the 39 Articles (originally 42)  and composed a Litany still used in the Anglican church today.  Henry himself preferred to maintain the English Church as Catholic rather than Protestant.  Edward VI succeeded Henry in 1547 but died in 1553. The accession of Mary (C of Aragon’s daughter) resulted in a Catholic reaction against Cromwell, and he was eventually stripped of his ecclesiastical titles and executed for heresy.  Mary’s strenuous attempts to restore the Catholicism of the English Church together with Cardinal Pole, was short-lived with the accession of Elizabeth,  The Church under Elizabeth went down the Protestant road, as originally envisaged by Cranmer.  It was this Protestantising of the English Church which resulted in Pope Leo XIII’s finding that Anglican orders were invalid.  However as I mentioned previously, there are now some validly ordained Anglican bishops because of vallidly ordained Eastern Orthodox bishops being included in the consecrating party of some Anglican bishops.  Clearly the situation of the English church during the time of the Tudors had rather more to do with the demands of politics, both domestic and international, than they ever had to do with religion.

His five-fold tiling is a favourite among recreational mathematicians; subsequently the tiling, which does not yield a repeating pattern was discovered in certain crystals.  The Wikipedia article on him is comprehensive, and includes criticisms of his views on the relationship between quantum theory and consciousness.  Interestingly, considering these views, he has described hmself as an atheist and he is an ardent supporter of the Humanist Association.  Contrariwise, he has also been awarded an honorary doctorate from a Belgium Catholic university.  He has also claimed to have evidence of a pre-existing universe before the Big Bang. \nI think there may well be philsophical and possibly scientific problems in associating consciousness with a scientific approach, even at the quantum level.  During life, animal consciousness appears to have an organising principle in the brain. When the brain deteriorates after death, this organising principle no longer survives.  Theologians have traditionally adopted a “spirit-based” approach to deal with this problem.  In quantum theory, it seems that the various fields are always associated with particles, hence the Higg’s boson to explain the gravitational field.  Are we to assert the existence of a field of consciousness? However, if a scientific approach is to be taken, this would seem to require the existence of a conciouness particle.  But wherein are such particles organised? \nOr am I to consider the concept of parallel universes, whereby consciousness.particles, possibly undetectable, can cross the boundaries between such universes?

It has certain definite physical characteristics.  The invention of lasers producing high intensity coherent light (light waves in phase) enabled Michigan researchers Leith and Upatnieks to apply the continous wave laser to holography. \nWe need I think to distinguish this purely physical optical phenomenon, from the metaphorical use of the word light, when we come to consider the “mystery of consciousness”, or such phrases as “Truth is Light”, “I am the Light of the World” and so on.  In these latter phrases, I suggest we are NOT referring to a literally physical aspect of light, but we are drawing on the mental imagery which our human experience of the physical properties of light can conjure up for us.  Thus an object remains visibly concealed from us until it is able to reflect the physical light that falls on it, when it then becomes manifest.  Whereas when we say that “Jesus is the Light of the world”, or even a human response such as “Suddenly light dawns” we are saying that these are ways of expressing a sudden insight of human understanding of something previously not understood.  \nThe distinction between the actual physical phenomenon, and our metaphorical use of the phenomenon is important, so that we can be quite clear as to what it is we are talking about.  Clearly the mystics, and I would include Teihard among them, frequently draw on such metaphorical uses of physical phenomena, and while this may aid our understanding and uplift our vision, paradoxically it can also render their intent obscure and confusing, if they are interpreted in too literal a way. \nTo say that consciousness is a type of hologram, I would prefer to say is best understood in this metaphorical sense.  I doubt if it should be interpreted literally as a hologram.  The advantage of saying that it is a metaphor, is that it provides us with a mental model as to what consciouness might be like, but not that it is to be thought of as a literally physical hologram.     \nDistinctions are important I think.  Teilhard was frequently accused of being a pantheist, but unjustly so.  But there is clearly a trap there for those engaged in exploring the mystical, of those things which our present understanding constrains us from as yet fully comprehending.  To see consciousness as an integral part of the universe, also runs the risk of pantheism.  The great religious break-through came when Mosaic monotheism made a clear distinction between Creator and Creation, between God and the Universe.\n\n","date":"August 23, 2012 at 12:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/22/can-our-consciousness-operate-independent-of-time-and-space/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Can our consciousness operate independent of time and space?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"As an avowed authenticist, I have noticed that the trolls and blather on this site are not merely confined to the skeptic lobby. \nAbsent the righteous vituperation, and John K still makes the valid point of the importance of the Shroud to Christianity, an under-utilised witness to the sufferings of Jesus, and a witness to the reality of the message of great love that he preached.  \nElsewhere I have recently written that the focus on the “authenticity debate” that we see too often on this site is an unnecessary distraction from that message.

Because, IMO, broken legs would hasten death but not immediately cause it. Unable to lift themselves up by their feet to counter their body weight, asphyxiation would indeed result in one final display of cruelty.” \nSee separate thread Stephen Jones’ on Zugibe vs Barbet. Barbet’s theory was that that the crucifarius had to exercise a see-saw motion transferring weight between arms and legs to maintain breathing; this could not be sustained indefinitely and the usual cause of death was therefore asphyxiation. Zugibe claimed that the weight could be taken on the legs and that breathing was therefore not a problem, cause of death being shock. By breaking the legs, death would be by asphyxiation regardless. \nGospel accounts claim that the soldiers broke the legs of the other two because of the forthcoming sabbath. J P Meier claims that John’s gospel is the more accurate, the Friday being Preparation day for Passover, the year probably being 30 AD. Exposing crucified bodies when Passover occurred on the sabbath was particularly objectionable. When they came to Jesus, he was already dead so they followed the legal requirement of percussio, piercing the heart, enabling the body to be released to the family. From reading Barbet, I get the impression that it was not unusual for the bodies to be exposed for perhaps several weeks, suggesting that the sabbath was not usually a  consideration, unless some Roman concession recognising local Jewish sensibilities perhaps made it an exception.\n\n","date":"December 21, 2013 at 4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/20/christmas-card/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Christmas Card"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"John, Thank you for sharing your insights.\nYour mention of Adam & Eve. and also Joshua & Jericho:  The literal interpretation of Scripture, while it may be promoted by certain fundamentalist sects, is certainly not the Catholic position.  Nevertheless there is a truth in all of scripture, which needs to be discerned and not just be taken at face value.  Like all good literature, the books of the BIble can operate at several levels.  Sometime during the last year, I was privileged to hear an excellent homily from a particularly gifted preacher who we are blessed in having in our local parish.  He presented the story of Adam & Eve, the garden and the snake in a way that all our sophisticated congregation could relate to.  “We have all been there.” He made the story perennial, current and relevant,  He was able to extract the Truth and meaning of the story, in a way that no biblical literalist ever could.  This is the real value of such stories, but it requires a special insight and understanding to be able to do this. \nIncidently, I understand that some paleontologists have been able to trace all of humanity to a single female source through mitochondrial DNA, and I think a particular fossil they found was nick-named ‘Eve’ as a result.  You can probably find this on the web.  One message here I think is that it underlines the universality of the human family, the brotherhood (or sisterhood) of our species.  Perhaps this is one message of the Genesis story. \nThe flood stories that the Jewish exiles discovered in Babylon permeate much of the ancient Middle East.  Such stories can be found whereever large rivers occasionally caused devastation in those civilisations.  There are no such stories in Egypt where flooding of the Nile is predictable, benign and beneficial.  One example is that of Utnapishtim in the Epic of Gilgamesh, as the hero sets out on his quest for immortality.  The Jewish writers took this story, and many parallels can be found, such as building the ark, sending out ravens and so forth, and gave it a new religious meaning, which we read in the story of Noah.  The fundamentalists are still looking for the remains of the ark on Mt Ararat, but they will never find it, as they have missed the point of the story. \nFor me, Teilhard was a true pioneer in his attempts to find a synthesis of science and religion, but llike all true prophets he was too far ahead of his time, and the church authorities were not ready for him.  He continues to be denigrated by conservative elements, as like many such with feet in two disparate disciplines, he was not received by either scientists or theologians.  His Jesuit superiors forbade him to publish during his life-time, and most of his published work is posthumous.  I made the comment above that accusations of pantheism against him were in fact unjust.  Consequently your own comment above that Pope Benedict has expressed admiration for his work is refreshing, and hopefully a breakthrough in appreciating Teilhard’s particular insights.\n\n","date":"August 23, 2012 at 8:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/22/can-our-consciousness-operate-independent-of-time-and-space/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Can our consciousness operate independent of time and space?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks for the URL Gabriel, it was worthwhile doing a Google translate from the original Spanish.

He chose his regnal name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi.  He is the first Pope born in the Americas.\nA comprehensive background of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Bergoglio \nHe is one of five children of an Italian railway worker. After studying at the seminary in Villa Devoto, he entered the Society of Jesus on March 11, 1958. Bergoglio obtained a licentiate in philosophy from the Colegio Máximo San José in San Miguel, and then taught literature and psychology at the Colegio de la Inmaculada in Santa Fe, and the Colegio del Salvador in Buenos Aires. He was ordained to the priesthood on December 13, 1969, by Archbishop Ramón José Castellano. He attended the Philosophical and Theological Faculty of San Miguel, a seminary in San Miguel. Bergoglio attained the position of novice master there and became professor of theology.\nImpressed with his leadership skills, the Society of Jesus promoted Bergoglio and he served as provincial for Argentina from 1973 to 1979. He was transferred in 1980 to become the rector of the seminary in San Miguel where he had studied. He served in that capacity until 1986. He completed his doctoral dissertation in Germany and returned to his homeland to serve as confessor and spiritual director in Córdoba.\nAs Cardinal, Bergoglio became known for personal humility, doctrinal conservatism and a commitment to social justice. A simple lifestyle has contributed to his reputation for humility. He lives in a small apartment, rather than in the palatial bishop’s residence. He gave up his chauffeured limousine in favor of public transportation, and he reportedly cooks his own meals.\nUpon the death of Pope John Paul II, Bergoglio, considered papabile himself, participated in the 2005 papal conclave as a cardinal elector, the conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. A widespread theory says that he was in a close race with Ratzinger until he emotionally asked that the cardinals not vote for him.[3] Earlier, he had participated in the funeral of Pope John Paul II and acted as a regent alongside the College of Cardinals, governing the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church during the interregnum sede vacante period.\nIn New Zealand, the run-up to the announcement of the conclave’s decision, Breakfast News interspersed its interviews with news rep Garth Bray at St Peter’s Square with reports that the NZ Parliament had just passed its second reading of the Same-Sex Marriage Bill by 77 votes to 44.  During the committee hearings several submissions were rejected and not heard as they were deemed to be too offensive to be seen by Parliament.  This included submissions by the ultra-conservative Catholic Action group.  Clearly there were better ways to be effective in opposing the Bill than the Catholic Action group were able to find. \nWhat has mystified me since the new Pope Francis was announced, is how I seemed to know his name about an hour beforehand.  As I was preparing the morning cereals and wifely cup-of-tea, I was pondering what the new Pope might be called.  I had rejected the names Pius, John, Paul and Benedict.  It occurred to me that he might choose Francis in view of the wold’s ecological crisis, and it seemed to be a natural choice.  How did I know this?  The Holy Spirit moves in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform.\n\n","date":"March 13, 2013 at 4:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/13/cnn-enhance-your-conclave-experience/","cat":"off_topic","title":"CNN: Enhance your conclave experience . . ."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"As sure as God made little green apples, you can’t become Francis the First, AFTER there’s been Francis the Second!\n\n","date":"March 13, 2013 at 8:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/13/cnn-enhance-your-conclave-experience/","cat":"off_topic","title":"CNN: Enhance your conclave experience . . ."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Argentine seems to be a land of contradictions.  As news broke of the election of Pope Francis, a scuffle broke out in the Chamber of Deputies.  The right-wing deputies wanted to hear Pope Francis’ first speech, while the left-wing deputies wanted to proceed with the set agenda item of honouring deceased President Chavez.  The Left being in the majority got their way.  Cardinal Bergoglio seems to come with some right-wing baggage arising from the crimes of the 1970-76 military junta when the church was widely seen as siding with the regime.  Progressive liberation priests disappeared, many being murdered.  Cardinal Bergoglio somehow survived, despite his advocacy of the poor. He denies the various allegations made against him during these dark days.  Concerning the scuffle in the National Congress, the “Atlantic Wire” commented: “Argentina’s Congress got in a fight over a guy that once sympathized with an authoritarian regime in order to hold a ceremony for another guy who was in charge of an authoritarian regime? Latin America is weird, sometimes.”\nCorruption and self-interested manipulation of the system also seems endemic to Argentina.  Both the Peronistas and subsequently the Kirchners came to power on a mandate of helping the poor.  Both have faced charges of corruption and feathering their own nests. \nWhat with his wily Jesuit background and his familiarity with the worst aspects of his homeland, one could hope that Pope Francis might well be more than a match for the schemers and corruption in the Vatican, and be able to sort out the banking scandals and other abuses. Reports suggest that he is not a familiar figure in Rome, and clearly he will need some inside help to get to the bottom of these matters. \nGlobally, Catholic Bishops have sometimes expressed their frustration at their views being ignored because of the power wielded by the Curia establishment.  Time will tell whether their concerns can be better addressed than seems to be the case in the recent past.  Will there be a Vatican Council III?  Who knows? That is what is probably needed. \nOne might hope that a papal chemical engineer might be roused to some interest in initiating further investigations into the Shroud of Turin.  The young Jorge Bergoglio entered the seminary at age 22, and perhaps any chemistry he once knew has long been forgotten. He would first have to penetrate the overly-protective Turin custodial wall to succeed in this, and perhaps in the initial stages of his pontificate he is likely to have rather more pressing priorities.\n\n","date":"March 14, 2013 at 5:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/13/cnn-enhance-your-conclave-experience/","cat":"off_topic","title":"CNN: Enhance your conclave experience . . ."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"if a proper scientific protocol of disciplined sampling, such as that originally promoted by Chagas, had been followed, there would be no need whatsoever even to discuss this matter; irrespective of whether the samples showed a 14th c. or a 1st century date.

To refer to it as a “spiritual body” seems to me a contradiction in terms.  A pure spirit does not have a body, nor is a body pure spirit.  It is christian doctrine that Christ’s body was resurrected, and we are to understand this as having some physical meaning, not merely a resurrection in the spirit. \nIf we are to look for an analogy, then I prefer one that sees our own familiar universe as a sub-set of a higher universe.  Thus an ant on a table-top may see his own universe as merely two-dimensional with no up nor down.  However from our own three-dimensional universe we may observe the ant and perceive that it does actually exist in a three-dimensional universe.  I think perhaps that the resurrection was something like that.  Christ was able to alight onto the table-top of our own three-dimensional universe from his multi-dimensional higher universe.  The question of passing through walls and closed doors does not enter into the equation.  And I don’t see that this concept involves the creation of any kind of new physics, but is merely a broadening of our perspective.

One of the semantic problems is that the term “spirit” in most languages seem to have several different meanings.  Essentially there seem to be two approaches, a) metaphysical, b) theological.  Significant metaphysical contributors include Leibnitz, Hegel and Berkeley, and it is necessary to read what they have to say about the subject to arrive at any conclusions, if that is at all possible.  On the theological aspects of the problem, my preference is for a Thomistic approach.

It is now generally considered pseudonymous, and almost certainly non-Pauline.  It is absent in some of the early canons, but was eventually included for its pastoral content.  It is hardly surprising that it might cite a passage or so from a gospel account.  \nWith the early expectation of the Parousia there would seem little point in committing the events of Jesus’ life to writing.  Because this expectation went unfulfilled, the decision would then have been made to commit the oral traditions received into the written form of the gospels.  That they originated from  a set of various oral traditions is evident from their pericope format, a set of structured brief episodes likely recited during communal worship, now gathered together into a coherent narrative.  \n2)  My point was that there was little if any evidence to demonstrate that Paul had any personal acquaintance with the earthly mission of Jesus, whereas the gospels are primarily concerned with setting down this narrative.

They derived from certain oral traditions, to some extent independent.  These traditions occurred within a society for which oral tradition was far more important than it is for instance in modern western society.  They rapidly assume a fixed form to the extent that any deviations from the accepted format can be deemed to be an incompetence.  I am familiar with this fixed attitude towards oral transmission of cultural traditions, particularly genealogies and rituals, among NZ Maori and Pacifica peoples.  It also occurs in African primal societies. \n2)  These oral traditions were used in different ways by the individual evangelists.  Thus both Matthew and Luke, as well as using Mark, have access to another source common to them.  Also Matthew and Luke each have access to a third and fourth source but which are not used by the other.  John’s gospel is to a large extent independent, but like Matthew and Luke also uses much of Mark’s Passion narrative.   They were also written at a time when there would have been witnesses still living.  The essential point is that in spite of whatever individual differences in use of source material occur, or their approach and style, all four gospels are fundamentally corroborative, \n3.  The conversion of Paul occurs well after the events of Jesus’ earthly life at a time when the followers were being persecuted.  In fact we are told that he supervised the stoning of Stephen.  He is not concerned with narrating the events of Christ’s death nor of his resurrection, but seeks to interpret them in his own particular way.  He is not a witness to the actual resurrection event as reported in the gospels, but a witness to the resurrected Christ as manifest to himself in his own particular conversion at a much later date. \n4.  Paul’s conversion is in fact narrated in Acts by the same author as the third gospel, Luke.  In fact Luke reports Paul’s conversion at three separate places:  Acts 9:1-9;  Acts 22:3-16;  and Acts 22:2-16, with some differences in detail owing to the use of different sources.  \n5. Paul’s own letters, although set down in writing at an earlier time than the gospels, report his own experience of Christ resurrected as the personal manifestation to himself.  There seems to be no specific evidence that he was familiar with Christ’s earthly mission or had even encountered him.  In his own words, it was as if he were born out of due time.\n\n","date":"November 19, 2015 at 5:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hello John.  I agree that the concept of spirit, and much else, is something different from matter.  However, in the history of both philosophy and theology, the concept has been highly contentious.  The Catholic Encyclopedia link I gave above is an interesting brief discussion, but I believe it is a transcript of the older early 1900s version and it may possibly be now somewhat dated.  Nevertheless it is still informative.  \nMy Encyc Brit package has much to say in an article on such metaphysics, but of course with no real conclusion.  It is evident that Leibnitz, Berkeley and Hegel had much to say on the concept of spirit, but there are several others, both ancient and modern.as a Google search on “notions of spirit” easily demonstrates. \nRecently my local U3A group ran a series of discussions on Evolution covering a lot of similar ground.  The later works of Darwin seem to see the development of morality and religion as part of the evolutionary process, and seems to have an essentially materialist bias.  It culminates in the work of Richard Dawkins.  As with any group of people discussing the topic, it proved to be contentious and of course resulting in no real consensus.  People will believe what they choose to believe. \nI think there is much of informative value in what the evolutionists can tell us.  My personal belief is that it demonstrates God’s plan of revelation to us.  But to ignore the contribution that religion has made to the development of civillisation in the course of its history is a gross error of judgement.  To me it corroborates this plan of God to bring mankind to Himself.  I prefer the approach of Teilhard de Chardin, in his seeking to synthesize science and religion.\n\n","date":"November 18, 2015 at 2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Response to Sampath: \nThe book, “Acts of the Apostles” is presented at its outset as a continuation of Luke’s gospel.  Both are addressed to one Theophilus, who may be some official, a real person, or it may just be a literary device, similar to that used by some other Greek authors.  “Theo-philus” could be translated as “Lover of God”, that is it may be intended for a general reader who wishes to know more about God.  \nPerhaps 50% of Mark’s gospel is used by Luke (In Matthew it is about 90%).  Like Matthew, Luke also uses Q.  However there is also material unique to Luke (L).  This includes the “old age” birth-story of John the Baptist, Luke’s Infancy narrative, and several parables (e.g. Good Samaritan, Prodigal Son).  All the material about John the Baptist is deliberately placed before that of Jesus.  Luke tends to humanise the portrait of Jesus compared to the starker picture presented by Mark and Matthew, there is a concern for piety and prayer, it comes from the Septuagint tradition, and there is compassion for the poor and despised.  However there also seems to be some ignorance concerning certain Jewish customs and Jewish geography.  (Luke does not appreciate that it is impossible to have a solar eclipse during Passover.) \nFrom about Ch 13 of Acts dealing with Paul’s mission to the Gentiles, the author adopts the pronoun “We” as if he is a companion on Paul’s journeys.  This may be the case, or it may be a literary device to establish the authority of his text with Paul as his guarantor.  Several differences from Paul’s own accounts and his pattern of thought have seemed difficult to reconcile the author of Acts as a close companion of Paul.  So he may be working from sources other than his own experience. \nThe three accounts in Acts of Paul’s conversion pose no difficulty in reconciliation.  In Acts 9:1-9 the conversion is part of the narrative;  In Acts 22:3-16, the conversion is presented as Paul recounting his experience to appease the rioting Jews seeking to kill him; In Acts 26:2-18 it is presented as his own account before King Agrippa and the governor Festus before Paul’s departure for Rome.  The differences are in only minor matters of detail. \nIf you are look for a good annotated on-line Bible text, then I recommend the USCCB version which I often use myself when on-line.

Only c. 31 verses of Mark are found nowhere in Matthew or Luke. In the material common to all three Synoptics, there is very seldom verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke against Mark, though such agreement is common between Matthew and Mark or Luke and Mark or where all three concur. \n2) The postulated common saying source of Matthew and Luke, Q, would account for much verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke when they include sayings absent from Mark. The fact that the sayings are used in different ways or different contexts in Matthew and Luke is an indication of a somewhat free way in which the editors could take material and mold it to their given situations and needs.  \n3) The placement of Q material in Luke and Matthew disagrees at certain points according to the needs and theologies of the addressees of the gospels, but in Matthew the Marcan chronology is the basic scheme into which Q is put. Mark’s order is kept, on the whole, by Matthew and Luke, but, where it differs, at least one agrees with Mark. After chapter 4 in Matthew and Luke, not a single passage from Q is in the same place. Q was a source written in Greek as was Mark, which can be demonstrated by word agreement (not possible, for example, with a translation from Aramaic, although perhaps the Greek has vestiges of Semitic structure form). \nIt is therefore a reasonable conclusion that both Matthew and Luke had access to Mark’s gospel, but there has to be an explanation as to why there is common material in Matthew and Luke not present in Mark.  Augustine’s speculation that Mark was an abbreviation of Matthew does not stand up to scrutiny in terms of modern scholarship.  Nevertheless the theory does re-emerge from time to time and has done so recently, but it remains a minority view.  Note that there is more agreement between Mark-Matthew and Mark-Luke than there is between all three.  This points to Mark as being a source used by both Matthew and Luke.  We then need an explanation as to a separate common Matthew-Luke source for material not found in Mark.  The Q source theory satisfies this requirement.  There is much that continues to be debated, such as whether there was a type of original Aramaic version of a Proto-Matthew now lost, which Mark may have used, but these debates are of more interest to specialists in exegesis, and being speculative I think are of lesser general interest.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2015 at 3:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Response to Don Andy at Nov 25, 20:18 pm:\nAndy, I note you have now been promoted to Deacon.

The notion of an after-life and a general resurrection was a very late development in Jewish thought.  (It can certainly be found in Maccabees)  In the New Testament the specific word “Paradise” (of Persian origin) only occurs three times: Luke 23:43, II Cor 12:4, Rev 2:7.  Certainly the Sadducees, the Jewish priests, rejected the notion of a general resurrection, even in NT times.  \nHowever the Septuagint LXX, which was the common Bible in those days uses the word “Paradise” some 46 times, but uses it in a variety of ways.  This was the Greek Bible which was translated in Alexandria in the 3rd c BC, originally to serve the requirements of Greek-speaking Jews, and partly for the requirements of the Great Library of Ptolemy II in Alexandria.  LXX comprised the Jewish Bible and several other works, the so-called Apocrypha, or deutero-canonical works.  It is frequently quoted in the NT.  Its general use by the early Christians to make their case, resulted in the Jews rejecting it ~100AD, and reverting to the original Jewish texts only.  Despite its use by the Catholic Church for 15 centuries, mainly as the Latin Vulgate, (also the Greek Orthodox) the Protestant reformers also decided to reject it, although not without some internal controversy. \nThe idea of an afer-life is clearly an early Christian teaching found in the New Testament, in the gospels and epistles, and finally as the New Jerusalem of Revelations.  A memorable saying of Jesus to the Sadducees found in John’s gospel is “Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad” (I paraphrase from memory).  Because it is in John, some liberals such as the ‘Jesus Seminar’ tend to reject this as a reliable saying of Jesus.  We also have the words from the cross to the ‘good’ thief, “Amen, this day you will be with me in paradise.”  \nSo it all depends what sources you’re prepared to use, but it is clearly an orthodox teaching, found in the practice of canonising as saints those whose lives have been exceptional.\nInterestingly, I searched in the index of my 380 page “Source Book of the Bible for Teachers”, published as long ago as 1970, but there was nothing listed under ‘paradise’ or ‘after-life’ and the only reference to ‘resurrection’ was confined to that of Jesus.  So maybe the denial of an after-life is not such a new idea at least in liberal circles. Orthodox Christians will beg to differ and will cite the NT refs.\n\n","date":"May 18, 2012 at 9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/18/do-christians-misunderstand-heaven/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Do Christians Misunderstand Heaven?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is perhaps not all that surprising that Jewish ideas of an after-life developed in such a cosmopolitan city as Alexandria.

So we might say that the development was some process of syncretism.  My own religious view is that God chooses his own methods of revelation of His Truth to humanity,  Clearly the Alexandrian Jews came to believe in an after-life which went well beyond the traditional Jewish idea of Sheol as the the abode of the dead.  The concept became part of early Christianity, was authenticated from the words of Jesus, and was developed further by the early Christian writers in the NT.  I do not see that the Christian view of heaven would sound so bizarre to Jesus as the lead article asserts.

The Indians had developed a true denary system including a zero place holder.  The system was adapted by the Arabs, using two different forms for the symbols.  The system was first introduced into the West by Gerbert of Aurillac when he became Pope Sylvester II around 1000 AD, and who had been exposed to Moorish education.  It only became popular during the 1200s when Leonardo Fibonacci, similarly educated, published his ‘Liber Abaci’.  Previously commercial transactions were calculated using a 10-base abacus, and written down using Roman numerals which had originated from shepherd’s tally sticks.  Astronomers and mathematicians continued to use a Babylonian 60-base system even well into the 1500s.  Coming back to New Testament times, both Greek and Hebrew used a 10-base alphabetic system.  The forehead bloodstain in the shape of the numeral ‘3’ only appears as such after 1898 when Secondo Pia’s negative photo of the Shroud became well known, and reversed the stain which on the original cloth appears as a Greek epsilon.

The full title of Ifrah’s Ch 29 is actually ‘The Origin of Hindu-Arabic Numerals’.  It was the Hindus who invented our modern denary counting system, and it included a place-holder zero.  The only precedent for it is the ancient Babylonian base-60 system which only survived in astronomy and mathematics.  No other civilisation ever came close to any similar system.  The Indian system migrated extensively into  South-East Asia, but the symbols were modified and adapted to suit local writing materials and styles.  The Arabs adapted the system, and two separate sets of symbols developed one eastward and the other westward. \nThe actual symbol used for the Cheddai date 346 (=AD 595) in the copper-plate deed appears as three near-horizontal scribed strokes with a vertical stroke down the middle.  The 3 symbol used in numbering the verses in the AD 875 poem is actually very close to our modern 3 with a small tail.  Ifrah has several tabulations of the symbols used at various times, and there is quite some variation, some of them particularly stylised.  The first appearance in the West occurs in a Visigoth manuscript ‘Codex Vigilianus’ of AD 876 where the 3 appears more as a stylised z with a reversed tail.  In this CV manuscript the numerals 1 and 6 to 9 are very close to our modern styles, the 2 is upside-down, but 4 & 5 are hardly recognisable as modern symbols.  Around 1000 AD Gerbert of Aurillac. as Pope Sylvester II attempted to introduce the system in commercial transactions by using numbered counters called ‘apices’ on a counting board replacing the abacus.  The appearance of the numbers would then depend on the observer’s perspective of the counter, which explains the upside-down 2. The apices system never really caught on. In the 12th century, Adelard of Bath translated several Arabic mathematical works and the apices method was discontinued.  Leonardo Fibonacci 1180-1250 had been educated by Arabic masters in North Africa and his published work ‘Liber Abaci’ popularised the arithmetic, counting systems, and symbols, pretty much as we know them today.\n\n","date":"March 30, 2015 at 5:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Note for SDJJ:  Hello & welcome.

I’ve been out of Shroud circulation over the last week or two because of current commitments on a few time consuming projects, but have followed this fascinating discussion.  Thanks to Yannink for initiating.this blog, and detailed exposition of Roger’s work.  Several commentators including Colin and Gabriel make I think some valid points. \nLike Colin I have some problems with the gas diffusion model, mainly because of the high resolution of the image, its lack of directionality, and the 3D encoding.  I feel there has to be some other process involved, more instantaneous than any diffusion process would allow, although diffusion of the gases may have been some kind of preliminary necessary for the action of image formation. \nI’ve previously mentioned Giovanna’s de Liso’s work on seismic image formation, “Shroud-like image formation during seismic activitiy”; Giavanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010″ at http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf .  I thought her paper showed some fairly persuasive looking images\nHowever so far I’ve been unable to find any enlightening commentary on her work.  I did not obtain a reply after sending an Email to her, asking her for any current comment. \nThe sharpness of the image seems to me to require some kind of light or other radiation, or a contact process. \nI feel I may be coming to the point where I may have to concede that the image formation has to be some kind of supernatural event.  I consider that so far the explanations that have been attempted fail to explain the unique qualities of the Shroud image, and we are all like the blind men of Gotham floundering around trying to describe a phenomenon we can’t begin to conceive. \nThe situation is not helped by the inertia of failing to pursue various assorted experimental programmes to look into the matter in a more systematic and enlightening way.\n\n","date":"June 15, 2012 at 5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My quick response to Yannick’s comments is one I gave earlier in the year when a similar topic was discussed. \nThe way to set up an experiment of this type is to start small scale with a range of variables.

The cloth’s early historical anonymity could be simply explained if, during that period, it was not known to exhibit an image. Although Wilson noted that botany specimens could develop, in seventyplus years, into “strikingly precise images in a sepia color closely akin to that of the Shroud”, he discounted all image formation processes that could not have been completed within the thirty-six hour entombment of Christ’s body. Wilson, The Shroud of Turin, p. 247. In 1981, S. F. Pellicori produced an image on linen sensitized by contact with a body covered in myrrh, olive oil, and skin secretions and theorized that the sindonic image had developed over a period of decades or centuries. See Drews, p. 19, citing S. F. Pellicori and M. S. Evans, The Shroud of Turin Through the Microscope, 34 Archaeology, pp. 34-43 (1981). In 1993, Dr. Leoncia Garza-Valdes suggested that bacteria had not only invalidated the results of the Shroud’s carbon dating, but had also formed the sindonic image over the course of a century. Garza-Valdes, pp. 56-57. Were an image not readily observable after the Resurrection, the Shroud’s earliest custodians may well have believed it to be only a blood-stained burial cloth, folded it, and hidden it away with other Passion relics, the image\nthereby being permitted to develop unperceived until the cloth was extracted from  concealment.”\nMore speculation – We don’t know!\n\n","date":"June 17, 2012 at 8:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"That seems like a fair comment, Colin.

Quite a good source to read is “The Quest For The True Cross”:  Carsten Peter Thiede and Matthew D’Ancona; Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2000, though now a little dated.  At the time of publishing, the University of Arizona had yet to do its carbon dating of the titulus in 2002.  You can of course Google to Wikipedia on “Titulus Crucis” for a summary. \nSanta Croce in Gerusalemme was built by St Helena on the site of her former palace in 325 AD, and after scavenging the Holy Land for relics of Christ’s Passion and Crucifixion, she relocated several of them here, although she distributed some to other locations as well.  Many of the original authentic relics definitely existed.  At the time of Egeria’s visit the “title” was shown as one of the relics at Jerusalem in 383: “A silver-gilt casket is brought in which is the holy wood of the Cross. The casket is opened and (the wood) is taken out, and both the wood of the Cross and the title are placed upon the table.”  \nFragments of the True Cross were dispersed throughout Christendom, the main portion of the Vera Crux was held in the custody of the Bishop of Jerusalem whence it was captured and recaptured.  Eventually the Crusader kings took up the practice of carrying it into battle as a talismanic weapon.  It finally disappeared in 1187 on the field of Hattin in Galilee in the Frankish battle with the sultan Saladin.  It was last seen tied to the tail of Saladin’s horse as he dragged it through the streets of Damascus as a trophy of his triumph.  \nIn view of the imperial court’s seizure of all these relics, as part of an exercise in enhancing its own authority and reputation, it is hardly surprising that such a relic as the Shroud, in whatever form it may then have been kept, remained hidden from them.  This acquisitive imperial streak of course continued with the Byzantine general John Curcuas, when he took under threat of force, the Image of Edessa, whatever that may have been. \nThe original Titulus Crucis was hidden around 452 during an attack on Rome by Visigoths and forgotten until 1492, when it was said to have been rediscovered by workmen restoring a mosaic, and was found behind a brick inscribed with “Titulus Crucis”.  In view of these dates, it is curious that the Arizona carbon dating asserted that the present artifact was made between 980 AD and 1146 AD.  If the dating is correct, the only explanation must be that it was intended as a replica of the original, but then why wait until 1492 to announce its rediscovery?  Possibly it was some kind of closely guarded secret know only to a select few sacristans??  \nDespite the Arizona dating, D’Ancona and Thiede seem to make a very plausible case for the relic, and if it is indeed a replica, then very likely it is a close imitation of the original. \nI would guess that the flagrum viewed by Sprott during his visit, is very likely some artifact recovered during an archaeological dig, possibly at Herculaneum (buried at the same time as Pompeii), or else is a reconstruction from Paul Vignon’s analysis of the scourge marks on the Shroud image.\n\n","date":"July 26, 2012 at 7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/26/god-only-knows-if-these-relics-are-truly-what-they-claim-to-be/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"God only knows if these relics are truly what they claim to be"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"From the perspective of a sometime student of Religious Studies, I think one of the most important, objective, distinguishing and defining features of Christianity is that it originates from a real, historic event. Other religions have other origins: They may include the deep thinking and reflections of their wise men, myths and legends from the mists of times long past, the human aspiration for a share of the divine, the struggle of a people for a defining identity, an awareness of a spiritual reality, or claims of a divine revelation.  Yet others have less to recommend them, based on superstition or originating from an ambition to impose the secular power of an elite, the demands of submisssion or a rebellious spirit against long-held traditions.\nChristianity may also share in some of these other features. \nHowever, for me, the importance of the Shroud, assuming its authenticity, is that it is a tangible witness to the reality of this historicism.  Others may interpret its significance how they will. For me, it is evidence that God did intervene in mundane human affairs, it inspires belief in this reality, and therefore gives real hope to humanity.\n\n","date":"May 2, 2013 at 4:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/02/good-question-what-would-proving-shroud-do/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Good Question: What would ‘proving’ Shroud do?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Science can only ever be a crutch of support.

Ian Wilson first mentions this work in his 1978 book at Chapter XXII.  Doubtless there are now more detailed and better write-ups available on this work, probably on the Shroud.com site. \nJackson and Jumper recruited another Air-Force colleague who seemed to match the TSM’s physique and draped a cloth over the subject.  They measured the body-cloth distance and correlated their results with readings from a densitometer on a Shroud negative, obtaining a perfect match.  Their further investigations with the VP-8 image analyzer followed, leading to the various 3-D images so familiar to us now. \nHow objective generalized scientific conclusions resulting from.that work may be written up is a matter of skill in accurate report writing.  I’ll confine my conclusions merely to saying that the Shroud clearly contains 3-D encoding of the subject, a property first noticed by Paul Vignon following the development of Secondo Pia’s photographic negatives.

Not only may they be a divine revelation, but their purpose is a private communication, so that there have to be elements reflecting the psychology and understanding of the recipient, for the revelation to be effective.  Thus if Hagin believed that Jesus was nailed through his palms, even with three-sided nails, then that is what he might very well see, and that would not necessarily nullify the vision. The test of the vision would be how effective Hagin was in his ministry to the sick. “By their fruits shall you know them!” A similar situation applies in the case of stigmatists. It seems that it is usual for genuine stigmatists to receive the imprints of Christ’s wounds, on their bodies corresponding to where they believe they occurred. \nWe can blame St Jerome for the tranlation of “cheir..” as “manus” rather than “carpus”.

In Dan’s subsequent posting on this topic, Gabriel hints that there must be implications about the image-forming process.  One might hypothesize for instance that if it has a chemical basis, then perhaps the gas(?) molecules emitted by the body are inherently unstable, and in the finite time that they take to arrive at the cloth are partly converted to a stable form, resulting in different concentrations at the cloth, giving the correlation between luminance (conversely opacity) and cloth-body distance.

In Luke 24, however there are two angels who give the women the message, the women go to tell the 11 apostles, Peter runs to the tomb, confirms their story, and then Jesus appears to two of the apostles on their way to Emmaus, but is unrecognised.  In John 20, only Mary Magdala is mentioned as coming to the tomb while it is still dark, sees the tomb is empty, she tells Peter, and then Peter & John confirm the story of the empty tomb; Meanwhile Mary waits outside the tomb weeping, she sees two angels who ask her why she is weeping, and then sees Jesus, mistaking him for the gardener.

However I suspect John Cleese is no longer in the business. \nTurning to the serious business of setting up a new scientific study of the Shroud, one could not do better than researching the background history of the STURP project.  Some of this is outlined in Ian Wilson’s 2010 “The Shroud”, chapter 5 ‘Under the Microscope’.  A more comprehensive and detailed story on the setting up of STURP is set out in the drafts of John Klotz’s forthcoming work “Quantum Christ”, particularly his chapter 7, ‘Game Change: Science Goes Deep, 1960-1978’. His Chapter 8 describes the ‘120 Hours in Turin’.  \nThe STURP team was to a certain extent self-selecting, but it comprised a very broad mix of several disciplines, a mix of pro-authenicists, those who were initially indifferent, and to some extent those who were initially anti-authenticist.  It was able to exploit the opportunity of the 1978 exposition celebrating the 400th anniversary of the Shroud’s arrival in Turin.  It proved to be the most detailed scientific investigation into the properties of the cloth and its image that had then been carried out.  Even so, there were a number of aspects that were overlooked and missed, and not studied due to lack of time and preparation, unexpected, or possibly insufficient forethought. Each of course had his own discipline and specialty, and if a particular specialty was not included in the team, that aspect could not be given proper attention. \nAn important aspect that is sometimes overlooked in discussions, is the question of funding, and the ernergy and efforts taken by a few individuals to raise the necessary, some $US2.5 million as at 1978. \nI’m inclined to the view that the only way a new STURP project might be implemented is if a small team of determined, qualified and competent people can set about formulating a definite game plan to bring it about.  They would need to be of sufficient youth and energy to see the project through during their own likely life-times.  Shroud conferences might be useful forums to air such a project and could generate useful discussion and ideas, and possibly provide useful avenues for specialist recruitment. \nOne advantage STURP was able to exploit, was in being able to draw on contacts with close affiliation to Turin, particularly Father Rinaldi, who was able to ease the way for their work.  Italy is not USA, nor the UK, nor for that matter Poland nor Switzerland.  It has its own culture and way of doing things, and social contacts are important in being able to get things done.  \nWithout such a broad, concerted and determined approach by those comptent to do so, I fear nothing will otherwise happen.  But if it does happen, expect to be prepared for a very long road ahead to see it through before a conclusion can come into sight.\n\n","date":"September 13, 2013 at 5:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/10/i-say-let-all-of-us-help-david-help-us-all/","cat":"crowdfunding","title":"I say let all of us help David help us all"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Les,\nThank you for your gracious response to my comments.\nWith regard to lions and crocodiles, it was intended to be aimed at the more fanciful speculations that frequently occur on this site from time to time.  If the nail image on the Shroud is adequately demonstrable, I have no problems with that.  \nWith regard to relative frequencies of nailing versus binding, the sources seem to have differning opinions on the matter.  I did go exploring to see if I could find some authoritative comment.  Quite a good report with several sources cited seems to be: “Crucifixion in Antiquity, the Anthropological Evidence”, by Joe Zias which can be found at:\nhttp://www.joezias.com/CrucifixionAntiquity.html  .\nIt includes the following comment: \n“Scholars have in fact argued that crucifixion was a bloodless form of death in that the victims were tied to the cross (Brandenburger 1969, Jeremias 1966). Martin Hengel, however who wrote what is perhaps the definitive scholarly report of the subject of Crucifixion in antiquity, takes along with Hewitt (1932) an opposing view and argues that nailing the victim by both hands and feet was the rule and tying the victim to the cross was the exception. During the first revolt of the Jews against the Romans in 66-73 CE Josephus mentions that in the fall of Jerusalem (70 CE) “the soldiers out of rage and hatred amused themselves by nailing their prisoners in different postures (JW 5.11 and 451).” \nThere is much more informative comment in the Zias paper.  He claims for instance that even Jews carried crucifixion nails along with other amulets, and were indeed permitted to carry them even on the sabbath.  This suggests that they were not all that uncommon.  One aspect is that it seems that the nails were bent over making them difficult to remove from the wood, without damaging the bones and flesh of the condemned victim.  So the record seems to lead to conflicting results as to their prevalence. \nI suggest that the nails were prized as amulets not so much for their rarity as for the superstitious appeal they may have had with their macabre association with a horrible form of execution.\n\n","date":"August 16, 2012 at 7:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/16/i-think-i-see-another-different-nail-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"I think I see another, different nail on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There is a clear distinction between writing a novel and reasonably objective reporting of facts, but I guess even news reporters have to make their stories sufficiently interesting if they’re to make a living at it.  In this case it is Les Fredette making the claim of associating his “sighting” of the Shroud nail image with the nail said to be found in the Caiaphas tomb, so I guess that is a genuine report of sorts.\nAs with many archaeological sites discovered during urban development work in and around Jerusalem, investigations into the Caiaphas site were badly done.  It cannot even be confirmed that the said nails were actually found in the Caiaphas ossuary, and like many such discovered artifacts they turned up in the hands of a private collector.\nDespite crucifixion being a surprisingly common form of punishment (A Syrian governor crucified 3000 rioters in Jerusalem around 4 BC following the death of Herod the Great), very few crucifixion nails have been discovered.  They were highly prized by the Roman soldiery as curative talismans, are rare, and so are collectible items.\nAs crucifixion was a common form of punishment, I guess there plenty of such nails available in those times,  So the Caiaphas nails could have come from any crucifixion at all.\nIf one of the nails was buried with Jesus, there would have been some hard bargaining with the executioners to acquire it, and maybe they retained the others, although various other relics are claimed to be nails from Christ’s execution,  If the nail was bloodied, that may have provided a reason for internment of the nail with the burial cloth – it would not normally be retained by a Jewish family as it was obviously unclean.\nThe Time report mentions apocryphal writings that claim that Caiaphas eventually became a late convert to Christianity, but this too is very likely fanciful.\nI have seen lions and crocodiles in summer clouds, but they weren’t there either!\n\n","date":"August 16, 2012 at 4:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/16/i-think-i-see-another-different-nail-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"I think I see another, different nail on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"What a fascinatng and beautiful set of comments, Kelly, and I like your analogies very much – they’re not trivial at all. \n1.  On Theology:  It is my persistent view that God will not compel belief – He invites it! Come share My Life with me is the invitation.  To reject God in the face of irrefutable proof is the sin against the Holy Spirit for which there can be no forgiveness.  But God is merciful.  So He hides His irrefutable proof, and it still remains an invitation, notwithstanding the five “proofs” by St Thomas Aquinas. \n2.  On Proof:  There are various degrees of proof.  My school years, now long gone, were at the time when Euclid was still part of the core math syllabus.  My teachers were such that we learnt his proofs of geometry, not merely by rote, but by means of logical induction, developing our sense of critical thinking.  In the early 1900s, Russell & Whitehead became dissatisfied with Euclid’s proofs, considering them non-mathematical.  But their project of transforming mathematics into more rigorous logic eventually failed as a result of Godel’s theorems and is now only of antiquarian and specialist interest.  Nevertheless a more rigorous approach in Pure Mathematics did emerge, and mathematical proofs are now seen as the idealised model of irrefutable methods of proof. \nIn the experimental sciences, the concept of proof is necessarily less rigorous than tht of mathematics, and are subject to amendment as new information comes to hand.  However the standard confidence level of 95% commonly used is entirely arbitrary.  In the Social Sciences and Applied Probability exercises, it is even less rigorous, and margins of error are routinely accepted.  I spent some 10 years with an Internal Audit office, and our conclusions had to be weighed on the balance of probabilities, merely sampling transactions on some systematic basis.  In my engineering days, an impatient supervisor once had to inform me that it was only the scientist who could pursue the rigorous truth, and the engineer had to be satisfied with an answer that would suffice for now.  In a court room, the weight of circumstantial evidence is sufficient to secure a conviction.  So there degrees of proof, depending on the circumstances in all matters of human affairs.  \n3. On Faith:  In contrast to rigours of Truth are matters connected with Faith.  We make several life judgements taken merely on faith.  But they are generally based on the degree of faith that we can feel comfortable with based on our experience and knowledge, that is, a rational or informed faith. A bride and groom make their vows based on the confidence they have come to accept in promises made by the other person.  They may be let down or be eventually disappointed, but hopefully their vows may survive despite what life throws at them.  To make life-changing decisions based on snap judgments only is to trivialize faith, and that way lies inevitable disappointment.  \n4.  The Shroud:  Somewhere between the rigorous requirements of scientific truth and an informed faith lies the mystery of the Shroud.  Each one may come to their own decision as to whether this cloth wrapped the divine body of the Saviour of the world or is something else.  For me personally the weight of evidence is too strong to reject it as anything but the former.  It is the love letter left by Jesus, and is meant for our time, to strengthen our faith.\n\n","date":"February 16, 2013 at 4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/16/imagining-the-shroud-of-turin-again-and-still-by-mathew-n-schmalz/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Imagining the Shroud of Turin AGAIN, and still by Mathew N. Schmalz"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"All of the papabile were given their red hats by either J P II or Benedict.

The nose; 2. The left knee-cap; 3. Both heels . The dirt on the nose and the left knee cap is almost certainly dirt from the road, as Jesus fell under the weight of the heavy cross beam tied over His shoulders. The dirt on the heel area was probably collected as Jesus stood at Calvary (a quarry area in Northern Jerusalem near Golgotha) waiting to be executed by Crucifixion. Joseph Kohlbeck and Richard Levi-Setti compared dirt samples taken from the Shroud with limestone from ancient Jerusalem tombs. \nWeb-site http://www.factsplusfacts.com/travertine.htm has the following extract:\n“Joseph Kohlbeck, Resident Scientist at the Hercules Aerospace Center in Salt Lake, Utah, and Richard Levi-Setti of the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago, examined embedded dirt particles taken from the foot region of the Shroud’s surface. Using a high-resolution microprobe, Levi-Setti and Kolbeck compared the spectra of dirt samples taken from the Shroud with samples of a relatively rare form of calcite, travertine aragonite, found near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem. The chemical signatures of the Shroud samples and the dust found near Golgotha were identical except for some minute fragments of organic cellulous linen fiber that could not be separated from the Shroud samples.”\nWeb-site http://holyshroudguild.org/ceacutesar-barta.html  has the following:\n“New evidence may explain image on Shroud of Turin” by Kohlbeck and Nitowski. Biblical Archeological Review (BAR), vol 12 n. 4, 1986, pp.23-24): By César Barta & Giorgio Bracaglia\nKohlbeck claims that in Jerusalem there is limestone and that this particular limestone is primarily travertine aragonite (New evidence may explain image on Shroud of Turin” by Kohlbeck and Nitowski. Biblical Archeological Review (BAR), vol 12 n. 4, 1986, pp.23-24) In addition, the Jerusalem samples also contained small quantities of iron and strontium but no lead. When a calcium sample from the Shroud was examined, it turned out to be aragonite which also exhibited small amounts of strontium and iron. Dr. Nitowski concluded that the Shroud at one time must have been in Jerusalem.”\n“Excerpt from a letter to Father Otterbein by Dr. Nitowski:\nLimestone (calcium) samples were collected from as far south as 30 miles from Jerusalem to as far north as the Galilee and Mt. Carmel.  As previously reported, Kohlbeck and Damian had matched a heavy calcium concentration from the foot area on the Shroud of Turin to samples collected in Jerusalem. This evidence was called into question, so sampling around Israel was performed to ascertain if such a test was valid. From as close as 30 miles from Jerusalem, the limestone changes and does not match either Jerusalem or the Shroud of Turin. Therefore, the match between Jerusalem and the shroud is a valid one. The Shroud of Turin was indeed in Jerusalem at one time during its history.\nSister Damian of the Cross, OCD (Dr. Eugenia Nitowski)” \nI get the impression that most of these conclusions were reached in 1986.  I also discovered that there were two other current sites, but these had privileged access rights only, possibly confined to specialist members of the STURP group.\nI aslo recall that some of the investigations showed that a sample was exclusive to a particular tomb associated with Holy Sepulchre.  \nIt looks as if an update on this question of travertine aragonite limestone may be needed, and as Gabriel mentions, possibly some further corroboration is required.  The traces of strontium and iron seem particularly significant, and the fact that the travertine aragonite limestone seems confined to within 30 miles of Jerusalem.\n\n","date":"March 23, 2012 at 5:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hi Antonella, It wasn’t clear to me that the initial posting had come from you until I followed up the link.

I am personally unaware of Feynman’s own religious beliefs although Encyc Brit includes the following extract:\n“Feynman’s views on quantum mechanics, scientific method, the relations between science and religion, and the role of beauty and uncertainty in scientific knowledge are expressed in two models of science writing, again distilled from lectures: The Character of Physical Law (1965) and QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985).”\nYannick: – Note that it is not Feynman referring to the ENEA work, but Garofalo!\n\n","date":"March 23, 2012 at 4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Re Travertine Aragonite Limestone residues reported by Kohlbeck etc:\nI obtained a very prompt response from Barrie, but sadly unless the original samples can be found in the Ray Roger’s files or samples held by STERA and as yet uncatalogued, it may very well be a lost cause.

In Isaiah 14:12 he is used as an allegoric subject of a taunt-song against the King of Babylon: “How you have fallen from the heavens, O Morning Star,* son of the dawn!  How you have been cut down to the earth, you who conquered nations! 13 In your heart you said: “I will scale the heavens; Above the stars of God* I will set up my throne; I will take my seat on the Mount of Assembly, on the heights of Zaphon.”  \nSo that he then becomes identified with the sin of pride, setting himself above the stars of God.  This theme of pride then seems to be taken up in the NT.  When the 72 return from their mission into Israel, they comment on how even the demons obey them and Luke has Jesus give the reply: ‘Jesus said, “I have observed Satan fall like lightning* from the sky.” [Luke 10: 18] which seems to echo the Isaiah passage.  He continues: “19 Behold, I have given you the power ‘to tread upon serpents’ and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you. 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”  I suggest that Jesus is implying that the forces of evil have an existent spiritual reality.  \nThis idea of Satan falling from the sky, finds an echo in Revelations 9:1:  “1 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star* that had fallen from the sky to the earth. It was given the key for the passage to the abyss. 2 It opened the passage to the abyss, and smoke came up out of the passage like smoke from a huge furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the passage. (etc) ”  \nThus, in Christian times Lucifer came to be regarded as the name of Satan before his fall. It was thus used by John Milton (1608–74) in Paradise Lost, and the idea underlies the proverbial phrase “as proud as Lucifer.” \nHowever, it is also apparent that those who suffered from various forms of mental illness were thought to be possessed by a devil or an evil spirit.  The two should not be confused by a modern mind, and I think it reasonable to believe that there are in fact evil spirits who desire the downfall of mankind.  How much of this is spiritual reality, and how much of it is merely a projected personification of the forces of evil is difficult to say.  \nAs a footnote, it is curious that in some primal societies, even today, those who suffer from certain types of mania, are sometimes seen as having access to a form of spiritual power, and are consequently granted an excess of temporal power or leadership, sometimes to the detriment of the tribe.  In history, to what extent have the several tyrants been driven by a type of megalomania, because they were perceived as having access to a type of divine power?\n\n","date":"August 29, 2015 at 6:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/28/is-pope-francis-walking-on-the-mystical-side/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Pope Francis Walking On the Mystical Side?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“To everything there is a season” (Ecclesiastes): A time to know, A time to believe, A time to question, A time to doubt, A time to reject! a time to accept!

It is essentially the paper he presented at the Societe de Saint Luc, Bulletin March 1938.\nFirst it must be understood, that the condemned person carried the cross-beam, the patibulum, to the place of execution where the upright stipes was kept permanently in place. With the victim lying on the ground with arms outstretched along the patibulum, the victim’s hands (wrists) were nailed to the cross-beam. The stipes would have been about 6ft high only, to make it reasonably easy for the execution party. The patibulum with the victim suspended by his wrists was then lifted onto the top of the stipes, which may have been fitted with a mortice and tenon joint to keep it in place.  The weight of the body, would then have sagged, resulting in the arms being at an angle of about 65deg to the vertical. The feet would then be nailed to the stipes. \nBarbet envisages the following procedure for removal of the body, which would be in a state of rigor mortis: \nFirst the nail through the feet would be removed from the stipes. Barbet does not dwell on the method. However, as an engineer, I can readily envisage a forged pinch-bar made probably of wrought iron which would serve the purpose. Wrought iron has been known from ancient times. The only problem is that it is malleable, and might be likely to bend, unless it was heat-treated and alloyed with some other metal. But I can readily envisage that the nail could be removed without further bodily damage. Remember that the Roman army was equipped with good metallic swords.\nThe patibulum with the victim still suspended would then be removed from the stipes. Barbet envisages a party of five would then transport the deceased, still attached to the cross-beam, to the tomb. This transport would be facilitated by the body being rigid in rigor mortis. He envisages that two men would support the patibulum, two would support the body mid-section using cloth bands, and one would support the feet. He claims to note that the right heel is poorly marked, and that this is the only part of the body touched by the transport party. \nThe absence of post mortem blood flows on the Shroud, points to the likelihood of this blood being lost during transport, (unless it was otherwise collected) and the body being laid on half the shroud, only at the place of burial. The nails would be removed from the patibulum, and the hands then with some little force be moved to the groin position. Barbet asserts that this can be readily done, even in the case of rigor mortis. \nThe above description is necessarily a terse summary of Barbet’s highly detailed description, which includes aspects of the post mortem blood flows. His work should be consulted if more information is desired. \nCrucifixion nails were highly prized by the Roman soldiery as medical talismans, so that few examples now survive. Of the nails that St Helena recovered, Constantine is said to have used one in his helmet, and converted another into a bridle for his horse. \nWith adequate tools, I can readily envisage that it would be quite feasible to remove the nails, without further damage to the body, particularly if the type of wood was selected with this ultimate requirement in mind, and if done with respectful care.\n\n","date":"December 6, 2013 at 4:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/05/it-is-too-bad-that-this-one-minute-apologist-interview-ran-for-two-minutes/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It is Too Bad That This One Minute Apologist Interview Ran for Two Minutes"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"After reading through the various web postings, I can see that this could be a most intriguing situation, and there may well be object lessons to be learnt for other church jurisdictions.  I suspect it would not arise where a church formed part of the legal establishment, such as the Anglican Communion in Britain.  I read that it appears to have arisen in South Carolina because the diocese became an incorporated body under state law in 1973 and presumably the judge is constrained by the contents of the incorporating document and the persons named in that document.  This would be a fairly common situation under several state, national and ecclesiastical jurisdictions.  In NZ for example most RC (arch)diocesan property, including parish churches would be registered under NZ law as the property of the (Arch)bishop of (diocese), “a corporation sole”.  I don’t know that the name of the (Arch)bishop at any particular time would appear on any secular registered state document or not, or whether if any kind of conflict arose whether the matter would be settled by some process based on the discernible facts of the case, and how Catholic Canon Law might influence any such decision.  \nThe ENS site has some fascinating opposing views and comments on the matter, which would be entertaining if they were not so sad.  One comment suggests that if the suit was successfully defended, then the remnant church would then be obliged to maintain several old buildings, which are registered historic places, but would be unable to fund their maintenance with their depleted congregations.

However the closing verses of the gospel indicates its final form was compiled by a Johannine school, probably at Ephesus.  The source for the several detailed discourses, particularly those at the Last Supper are a serious problem.  The discourses are several, long and involved.  They purport to have been said by Jesus. John’s gospel was known by about 100 AD, but its acceptance as canonical did not come about until 180 AD.  There are few indications that it was originally Aramaic, and there is an absence of the usual signs of translation into Greek.  The assertion that the words were first written onto wax tablets and later transcribed onto goat-skin, would seem to owe more to a ‘post hoc’ creative imagination to justify a position, rather than on any kind of hard evidence. \nThe percentages of Mark’s gospel found in Matthew and Luke, as quoted by Max, are inaccurate.  Encyc Brit states that of Mark’s 661 verses, some 600 appear in Matthew (i.e. 90.8%), and 350 in Luke (53.0%).  Only 31 verses of Mark (5.7%) appear in neither.  Where any two of the synoptics agree against the third, it is always Mark and Matthew that agree against Luke, or Mark and Luke that agree against Matthew.  Matthew and Luke never agree against Mark.  This points to Mark’s gospel being used as a source by Matthew and Luke.  Furthermore there is a distinct “telling it like it is” in Mark, whereas Matthew and Luke are more circumspect.  A simple example from Jesus’ preaching in his home-town: In Mark we have “Is this not Jesus the woodworker?”  becomes in Matthew “Is this not the son of the woodworker?” and in Luke “Is this not the son of Joseph?” (no mention of a manual trade!)  Mark’s writing of Jesus’ anger or the disciples’ shortcomings is more restrained in the more respectful later gospels of Matthew and Luke.  \nThe common material found in Matthew and Luke, but not in Mark, generally the logia or sayings, have been postulated as coming from a separate source, sometimes referred to as ‘Q’.  However the placing of this material varies in both gospels after chapter 4.  The commentaries in the Jerusalem Bible translation, under general editorship of Alexander Jones, are not entirely satisfied with this theory.  They fall back on Papias 125 AD assertion that Matthew wrote the sayings in the Hebrew tongue, and identify it as “Matthew Aramaic”.  They see a certain roughness in some of Matthew which justifies this position, and claim that even Mark used some of this material.  I am uncertain to what extent these commentaries may be concerned to respect the patristic sources, which for all we know may only be faulty best guesses on their part to provide an adequate explanation as to the origin of the gospels,  Other patristic sources which say much the same thing are merely echoing Papias.  Yet it was Papias who said that he preferred the oral traditions to anything written, thus testifying to a “teaching church” rather than a “writing church”.  Not all the fathers had a great respect for Papias’ opinions (e.g. “a man of little brain”).  \nAs to the congregation for which Matthew’s gospel was written – the general consensus seems to be that it was written for Judaic converts to Christianity, somewhere in Syria, possibly Antioch.  There is frequent reference to Christ fulfilling the prophecies of the OT, Matthew is concerned to portray Jesus as the new Moses – he brings him out of Egypt, he has him preaching from a mountain (c.f. Luke has him on an open field), and so on.  However Matthew is also concerned to demonstrate Jesus as the Messiah to the gentiles – gentiles in his ancestry, the wise men from the east, frequent cures involving gentiles.  \nThe conclusions we may draw from either internal or external evidence, can never be final, and I think it ill behoves any of us to make dogmatic assertions about whatever opinions we may conceivably reach.  Like the Shroud, the origins of the gospels in their final form are hidden in the mists of time, but they exist for the present, to enhance our lives, and to give witness, as we may allow them to do so.\n\n","date":"January 15, 2013 at 12:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My posting was prompted by the Louis comment: “The problem is that the fragment is in Greek.

The preachng was very likely in Aramaic, fishermen’s competence in literacy was probably limited to their commercial requirements, although a few of the disciples, e.g. Levi (or Matthew), probably had scribal literacy, wax tablets would hardly create any kind of permanent record, more likely an initial aid to prompt oral recall, transcription into koine Greek – yes;  the Greek Septuagint was the version of the OT commonly used, its use by the early Christians prompted a Jewish reversion to a Hebrew text only late in the first century but without the Septuagint, apocrypha (deutero-canonical) texts,   However the gospel authors went much further than merely transcribing Aramaic preaching – they were writing for a gentile church, where the common language was essentially koine Greek.\n\n","date":"January 13, 2013 at 3:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Because of the varying views among biblical scholars, the ultimate authority I prefer to have recourse to is the very long and comprehensive article on Biblical Literature contained in the Encyclical Britannica, which is at least a reasonably universally recognised authority.  This is not to say that Encyc Brit is necessarily infallible, as several of its various articles have been completely revised over the decades as new information comes to light through research and scholarship.  However I consider that for the most part, it is as reliable an authority as is available at any given time.  From the article’s introduction I surmise that the principal contributors on the gospel sections include: The Rev. Krister Stendahl: Bishop of Stockholm, 1984-88. Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Divinity, Harvard University, 1981-84; Dean, Divinity School, 1968-79.  Others have also contributed.  \nA few Encyc Brit extracts on authorship and dating of John’s gospel follow: \n“Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown. ”\n“Because both external and internal evidence are doubtful, a working hypothesis is that John and the Johannine letters were written and edited somewhere in the East (perhaps Ephesus) as the product of a “school,” or Johannine circle, at the end of the 1st century. The addressees were Gentile Christians, but there is accurate knowledge and much reference to Palestine, which might be a reflection of early Gospel tradition. ”\n“The Jews are equated with the opponents of Jesus, and the separation of church and synagogue is complete, also pointing to a late-1st-century dating. The author of John knows part of the tradition behind the Synoptic Gospels, but it is unlikely that he knew them as literary sources. His use of common tradition is molded to his own style and theology, differing markedly with the Synoptics in many ways. ”\n“Yet, John is a significant source of Jesus’ life and ministry, and it does not stand as a “foreign body” among the Gospels. Confidence in some apostolic traditions behind John is an organic link with the apostolic witness, and, from beginning to end, the confidence is anchored in Jesus’ words and the disciples’ experience-although much has been changed in redaction. Traces of eyewitness accounts occur in John’s unified Gospel narrative, but they are interpreted, as is also the case with the other Gospels. ” \nIt notes that John’s Greek is relatively simple, and that various background influences have been suggested including: Greek philosophy; Works of Philo of Alexandria, Hermetic writings, Gnosticism, Mandaeism, Palestinian Judaism; Wisdom components from Qumran.  \nAll of the above is consistent with my previous assertions that John’s gospel is a product of complex redactions, that its final form was written in Greek and compiled by a Johannine school, probably in Ephesus towards the end of the end of the 1st century, that its detailed knowledge of geography and Judaic religious practices support an apostolic origin but not necessarily final authorship.  Clearly there had to be some process from when the original Aramaic or Hebrew sources became embedded into the gospel’s final Greek form.  Evidently the contributors are not prepared to speculate on what that process might have been, nor to such components as oral recall or written notes.  Neither shall I.  The observation that some two dozen biblical scholars consider a much earlier dating viable is interesting, but here it depends on what they mean by that.  The gospel itself is extremely complex, As its origin clearly has links to apostolic times, there had to be some material, either written or oral, available quite early.  However the complex treatment of that material evidently took some duration, and we only know the gospel in its final form.  There would seem to be little point in compiling such a complex gospel until such time as a need for it came to be recognised.  The highly developed theology in chapter 1, as to the Word existing from the beginning, contrasts with the synoptics’ origins of Jesus, Mark’s opening section on his baptism in the Jordan, and the Mattean and Lucan infancy narratives, which I think are strong arguments against John’s predating the synoptics. \nMy response on the synoptic statistics, to follow.\n\n","date":"January 15, 2013 at 4:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Response: No, I do not!  From mine above re John: “Confidence in some apostolic traditions behind John is an organic link with the apostolic witness, and, from beginning to end, the confidence is anchored in Jesus’ words and the disciples’ experience-although much has been changed in redaction. Traces of eyewitness accounts occur in John’s unified Gospel narrative, but they are interpreted, as is also the case with the other Gospels.” (Encyc Brit);  Also: “its detailed knowledge of geography and Judaic religious practices support an apostolic origin but not necessarily final authorship.”  And: “As its origin clearly has links to apostolic times, there had to be some material, either written or oral, available quite early.”  BUT – All within the context written above!  I previously noted Papias’ comment that Matthew had written the sayings in Hebrew and everyone translated them as best they could.  I could speculate that this might be the so-called ‘Q’ source, and it might be the reason that Matthew’s name came to be associated with the so-named gospel to give it apostolic authority – in that gospel, the disciple named Levi is changed to Matthew.

It is almost certain that Jesus was not married – the gospels and most NT apocrypha silence about a wife are persuasive evidence that Jesus was not in fact married and there can be litle argument about that.  The responses above suggest a reaction against some unspecified assertion that he was.  I doubt if any serious scholars would now make such an assertion. \nHowever in early Christianity, both orthodox and gnostic, there was an active debate about the competing merits of celibacy and married life, because of an early unfulfilled expectation of the Parousia – evidence for this debate can be found in Paul’s writings for instance.  The fragment, if indeed it is authentic, should only be seen in that light.  It may be evidence of some sect’s attempts to justify marriage as a way of life, as opposed to celibacy.  An alternative explanation may be that “the wife” is intended to refer to the church.  \nThe prolonged duration of the testing period to establish authenticity, suggests that there may well have been some kind of problem with establishing authenticity.

But then you refer to “words often in the same order” and this could imply something about phraseology.  The most meaningful statistic when comparing who depended on whom, seems to me, to be the measure of number of verses.  On that basis, it is a false assertion that 88% of Mark is in Luke, although I could concede that Luke may have used 88% of Mark’s vocabulary, but that would seem to me irrelevant when discussing use of material.    \n“In approximate figures, Mark’s text has 661 verses, more than 600 of which appear in Matthew and 350 in Luke. Only c. 31 verses of Mark are found nowhere in Matthew or Luke. In the material common to all three Synoptics, there is very seldom verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke against Mark, though such agreement is common between Matthew and Mark or Luke and Mark or where all three concur.”\n“The postulated common saying source of Matthew and Luke, Q, would account for much verbatim agreement of Matthew and Luke when they include sayings absent from Mark.

The way you have written his name, presumably a transliteration from some Hebrew source, suggests to me the possibility of a family connection with the Maccabees, I wonder.  There is a strong tradition that Peter in Rome was the authority behind Mark’s gospel, see closing verses of I Peter (epistle) for instance.  Whether he was the same John Mark that disappointed Paul in Acts, or whose mother’s home was a regular meeting place, we might guess.  As we have discussed previously (e.g. ossuary stats etc) the reservoir of Jewish names was much more limited than modern names, but it seems quite likely it could have been the same person,  \nJB has an interesting complicated take on the origin of the synoptics, which I think may owe something to your French RC exegetists.  Following Papias, (I imagine), it postulates a primary Matthew Aramaic with sayings and some narrative, but originating from an oral tradition.  It then claims that Mark, as well as Matthew Greek used this primary Matthean Aramaic, but that Mark omitted the sayings.  Nevertheless it claims that Mark’s gospel is a gospel in its own right that can stand on its own.  It claims to detect more primitive forms in parts of Matthew, more so even than Mark.  If Mark had Peter as a source, it puzzles me why he should feel the need to have recourse to another external source, and why he should then  omit the sayings.  The final Matthew Greek, and Luke even more so, is more circumspect concerning “unfavourable” reporting compared to Mark.  \nAs I have repeatedly attempted to express in our exchange, the production of the gospels into their final form was not I believe a simple matter, but was rather more complex, and a fertile ground for speculation as to how it all came about.  I’m drawn towards a conclusion of extensive, possibly ongoing, redaction by a teaching church responding to current needs as it saw them, but conserving apostolic tradition as well as it could.\n\n","date":"January 17, 2013 at 8:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think that was probably an over-statement on my part.  I would stand by the comment I made on Luke, but the Greek found in John’s gospel is said to be fairly simple (Encyc Brit).  I have already commented that there was clearly some process whereby the original Aramaic preaching came by some unknown process to be finalised into its ultimate Greek form.  What that process was, I think, is lost in the mists of antiquity, notwithstanding the assertions of some two dozen NT scholars.  It seems that Clement as early as 150 AD considered the gospel to be apostolic.  \nJB notes that the absence of reference to “the sons of Zebedee” in John’s gospel, may point to John the Apostle being the initial author, and early fathers (e.g. Iraeneus) claim that John wrote the gospel in Ephesus and Revelations on Patmos.  However JB also mentions one tradition that John was in fact martyred during the 1st century.  In the 6th century, the church of Ephesus claimed to possess the autograph of the Fourth Gospel.  At the end of the 2nd century, Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, claims that John’s tomb is at Ephesus, identifies him with the beloved disciple, and adds that he “was a priest, wearing the sacerdotal plate, both martyr and teacher.” There were in fact two rival sites in Ephesus claiming to be his tomb.  Legend was also active in the West, being especially stimulated by the passage in Mark 10:39, with its hints of John’s martyrdom. Tertullian, the 2nd-century North African theologian, reports that John was plunged into boiling oil from which he miraculously escaped unscathed.   \nOne resource I have, mentions that the education of young Jewish boys in 1st century Palestine apparently included instruction in the “Hebrew scriptures”, but I would be uncertain whether that would refer to the Septuagint (it was in general use at this time), or the actual Hebrew scrolls.  So there may have been some more general acquaintance of pure Hebrew than I had granted, but of this I’m not certain.  \nThe complexity of thought in John’s gospel, and the evidence of several external influences, including the dualistic thought of Qumran, and traces of gnosticism, and so on, would seem to argue against a single author of the gospel in its final form as we now have it.  It may be that a single religious genius might have had the ability to write it, but I think it does strain the bounds of plausibility that one fisherman wrote the entire bulk of it,  A series of redactions by a Johannine school, probably at Ephesus, working on an original autograph has I think got more going for it.  Against this argument, might be the unity of the whole.    \nConcerning an earlier comment I made about the lack of appreciation in monolingual cultures about the multi-lingual capabilities in other societies:  In NZ we have several well-known Maori and Polynesian writers who are quite comfortable in writing in either English or their native tongue, and who reguarly win national awards for their work, perhaps one advantage of living in a smaller country.  At Victoria University in Wellington, the senior lecturer in professional writing for many years was in fact a highly thought-of Maori professional writer.  My own nephew, whose mother was Ngati-Porou, a professional polytech teacher, has won prestigious national awards as a playwright for instance, and is comfortable in writing in either language.  My point in mentioning this, is to demonstrate that there may be less difficulty for Judean evangelists writing in the Greek language than has been imagined.\n\n","date":"January 17, 2013 at 4:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A minority view holds that there were Aramaic texts which formed some part of the basis of the synoptics.  However it is not a common view, and this view might well only stem from the evidence of the more naturally Aramaic style of the authors.  It would seem most likely that Jesus would preach in Aramaic, and also speak Aramaic among his intimates.  It needs to be remembered that in these early cultures there was a strong tradition of accurate oral recall (It is still evident in the recital of traditional NZ Maori genealogies and their other customary recitals) – there was not the same requirement to rely on written material as there is in a modern culture.  So whether there was the need for Aramaic written sources or not can be argued.  No Aramaic original sources have ever been found.  Furthermore, both Mark and Matthew were writing for predominantly gentile churches, essentially Hellenic.  Luke’s polished Greek is certainly the original language, and likewise there can be no question about John’s Greek.  If the fragments mentioned above are authentic, it is hardly surprising that they would be primitive or koine Greek. \nWe should note that even in Mark, Aramaic phrases occur which are then deliberately transliterated into Greek.  This would hardly be the case if the original language of Mark was Aramaic.  Encyc Brit comments: “In Mark, some Aramaic is retained, transliterated into Greek, and then translated-e.g., in the raising of Jairus’ daughter (5:41) and in the healing of the deaf mute (7:34). The well-known abba, Father, is retained in Mark’s account of Jesus’ prayer in Gethsemane. In the two miracle stories, the Aramaic may have been retained to enhance the miracle by the technique of preserving Jesus’ actual words. And a cry of Jesus on the Cross is given in Aramaized Hebrew.”  All this would seem to argue that the original language here was Mark’s rough Greek.\n\n","date":"January 13, 2013 at 6:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Ignorance upon ignorance compounded!

I tend to blame Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida for their impact on present educational systems through their philosophies of relativism.  The comments there are in sharp contrast to the intelligence of the readers frequently displayed here on Dan’s site. \nThe question of what is real and what is imaginary was first examined in great detail by the 17th c. mathematican, philosopher and scientist Rene Descartes.  Beginning at “Dubito, ergo sum” and then proceeding to “Cogito, sum”, he finally arrived at his ontological proof of the existence of God in his work “Meditations”.  However even this conclusion was flawed, as the God that Descartes had constructed by this means was no more than Descartes’ own idea of God.  It was one of a number of key errors in Descartes’ reasoning, which even extended to mathematics.  He would not believe for instance that the lengths of various curves could be resolved, despite the discovery of the calculus, and his own invention of coordinate geometry, and as demonstrated by the the work of Pierre de Fermat.    \nIf Descartes made major errors.in his philosophy, and in other fields, what chance have lesser minds to arrive at the truth?  Perhaps most of us resort to falling back on the empirical principle:  “What is reasonable?” or “What conclusions would a reasonable, well-informed person come to?” as a working principle for daily living.  But of course, even this has hazards and to be wrong is to be human.  To fall back onto earlier certainties such as the philosophies of Aristotle and St Thomas would appear to be retrograde.  Even the principles of so-called “scientific scepticism” can be demonstrably unproductive.  Can scientific experiment yield truth?  It seems only about the material world, and only then if rigorous sampling protocols are followed!  The interpretations and conclusions therefrom are another matter. What does “What is reasonable?” mean?!\n\n","date":"December 13, 2012 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/13/livescience-goofs-again/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"LiveScience Goofs Again"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Fringe lunacy giving religion a bad reputation.

B. Segal, whom Wilson rightly regards the best modern authority on\nEdessa, and its earliest Syrian versions do not relate the existence of any miraculous image of Jesus.  Segal concluded that Christianity did not arrive in Edessa until late in the second centuryand Wilson himself has recently acknowledged that the factual underpinnings of the Abgar legend may well be.attributable to that latter era.”\nMarkwardt cites ‘See Wilson, The Blood and the Shroud, pp. 161-175’.  I don’t have a copy of that particular text, but I expect to be able to follow it up. \nIn his 2010 book “The Shroud”, Wilson, Bantam Press, he discusses the issue comprehensively on pp 116 – 123.  He recounts Eusebius story of Abgar V and the alleged correspondence with Jesus on p.116.  He writes: “So what about that hornet’s nest of controversy?  Immediately needing to be made clear is that, even without its tenth-century Image of Edessa component, the Abgar story is one that historians have long viewed with the greatest scepticism.  Pope Gelasius (pope 492-496) … (letters declared apocryphal) … modern day scholars … fully justified. (allusion to John 20:29 … written afterwards) ” Continues.  “Abgar V was part of a dynasty of rulers bearing the same name, and one successor slightly more favoured by historians as the Abgar whom Addai converted (AND WHO THEREFORE MAY HAVE BEEN THE TRUE RECIPIENT OF THE IMAGE OF EDESSA / SHROUD) IS ABGAR VIII, WHO REIGNED 179 TO 212 [Daveb emphasis]”.\nWilson continues this discussion.  He is evidently not entirely pursuaded that the recipient is not Abgar V, as he finds it difficult to accept that Edessa was ignored by 1st C Christian missionaries because of its proximity to Antioch and Palestine, compared to other further cities that were in fact evangelised.  He also provides support that Addai was in fact a 1st C missionary.  Nevertheless, it is apparent that he is not as dogmatic in this position as YC has alleged, and is prepared to consider other explanations. \nI am more pursuaded by the Markwardt 2008 hypothesis: “… when the royal scribe, at the direction of Abgar (VIII) and under the supervision of Bishop Palut, applied the precepts of the Discipline of the Secret and inserted, into the official archives, an allegorical narrative designed to protect Abgar (VIII) and those who had participated in his baptism,and that it is this allegory which was subsequently transposed into the ancient Syriac and Greek Abgar (V) Legends”  ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET, pp 26-28;\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf\n\n","date":"October 5, 2012 at 5:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/28/losservatore-romano-weighs-in-on-the-coptic-papyrus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"L’Osservatore Romano Weighs In on the Coptic Papyrus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick Clement’s pathological dislike of Ian Wilson and all his works blinds him to what Wilson is actually saying, and YC is only too willing to read Wilson out of context.\nThe paper Wilson presented at Valencia begins with a correct reprise of a paper he first presented in 1973 to the British Catholic Herald, and followed up in his 1978 book “The Shroud of Turin”  In the second paragraph of the present 2012 paper, he then gives a succinct correct summary of what that theory was (para as quoted by YC).  From this en passant comment, it is unreasonable of YC to say that Wilson is still taking the legend as historical fact, if in fact that was ever Wilson’s view..  \nBut that is not the main topic of the 2012 paper which now readdresses the missing years between 1204 and 1350, for which he is clearly having some new ideas, dismisses the Templar claims put forward by Barbara Frale, and also presents some new material to support his case that the Shroud and Image of Edessa were very likely the same object.  But Wilson is not being close-minded or dogmatic about this hypothesis, acknowledges that there are Byzantine scholars who disagree with this theory, and uses conditional expressions such as “…if the Image of Edessa really was our Turin Shroud…etc”.  He points out his reasons how objections to the theory might be overcome.  All of this he is entitled to do, and at least he has made the effort to consider others’ views, and without rancour!  \nIn 1999, Jack Markwardt in his paper “Antioch and the Shroud” was able to write, pp1-2:\n“Segal concluded that Christianity did not arrive in Edessa until late in the second century and Wilson himself has recently acknowledged that the factual underpinnings of the Abgar legend may well be attributable to that latter era” (and cites: See Wilson, The Blood and the Shroud, pp. 161-175)\nMarkwardt in his subsequent 2008 paper ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET, gives a most credible explanation for the origin of the legend in the time of King Abgar the Great around 200 AD, see pp 26-28.  It includes the following passage:\n“It is doubtful that, even under the tolerant Commodus, the details of Edessa’s conversion would have been accurately recorded for fear of unforeseeable imperial consequences. Nevertheless, and despite what might have been originally reported, the archives were assuredly modified after Septimius Severus assumed power in 193, and perhaps again, in about 201, when he issued an imperial edict banning conversions to Christianity. The recently-baptized Edessan king, as well as the city’s new Bishop, confronted a serious dilemma: How could the most historically-significant event in Church history be recorded without incurring the resultant fatal consequences? The author suggests that by 200, and with orthodox Christianity now firmly established in Edessa, the quandary was overcome when the royal scribe, at the direction of Abgar and under the supervision of Bishop Palut, applied the precepts of the Discipline of the Secret and inserted, into the official archives, an allegorical narrative designed to protect Abgar and those who had participated in his baptism,and that it is this allegory which was subsequently transposed into the ancient Syriac and Greek Abgar Legends.” \nMarkwardt continues giving an explanation of how the allegory might be read, identifyng the various 200AD historical personages in terms of the Abgar legendary characters. \nI see this as an excellent example of how allegorical legends are to be read and interpreted correctly, penetrating a mystery, instead of dismissing them as mere fairy tale concoctions.  They more than often have a valid historical basis, which a literalistic turn of mind is doggedly determined to remain blind to, and will forever be unable to comprehend.\nI should think that even this relatively detailed note of mine will if it is read at all be wilfully misinterpreted by those who cannot see beyond the limits of their own preconceptions.\n\n","date":"October 5, 2012 at 5:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/28/losservatore-romano-weighs-in-on-the-coptic-papyrus/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"L’Osservatore Romano Weighs In on the Coptic Papyrus"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I’m unaware of the two plays Max mentions, perhaps he has not quoted the titles correctly.

However pure logic tells me that it is the percentage of verses that matter for the purpose of this debate (who was copying whom).  \nConcerning the question of Hebrew/Aramaic vs Greek, I suspect there’s a lack of appreciation of the multi-lingual capabilities of other societies by those writers who are constrained to live in a mono-lingual culture.  Hence they see a difficulty where none exists.  \nKoine Greek was the common language in the eastern part of the empire, various Aramaic dialects a close second, (Peter’s style of speech revealed him to be a Galilean to the maid-servant), with local pockets of other indigenous languages.  I believe pure Hebrew very likely had tended to become confined among the Jews for religious purposes only, and therefore unlikely to be a suitable means of transmitting the gospels to a wider congregation.  I have already conceded that there had to be some unknown process for transmitting the Aramaic preaching and sayings of Jesus, into their final Greek form.  [Papias’ comment that Matthew wrote the sayings in the Hebrew language, may or may not be the case – they might well have been the original Aramaic collection.]  However the general consensus seems to be that there are only tenuous signs of translation in the Greek gospels.   \nFor the record, the version of Encyclopaedia Britannica I use is the “2006 Ultimate Reference Suite” which unsurprisingly post-dates 1939, and has yet to pass its “use-by-date”.  Notwithstanding minority dissenting research since 1970, such research hardly seems to have affected the generally held consensus of the majority of exegetes since published elsewhere.  That is not to say that it may one day do so.  Whether that will be a good thing or no, there is now some evidence of an unfortunate ill-informed trend among some powerful conservative religious lobbyists even to abandon Marcan priority.  Such an unfortunate trend can hardly create confidence in the worth of “recent research”, and one might suspect kudos-seeking from those pursuing the alleged discovery of novelties, rather than an honest distilling the truth of such matters..\n\n","date":"January 16, 2013 at 4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“G.o.d.ot: “… nothing happens twice …” – open to two possible interpretations.

Wrist nailing:  The only scriptural source we have for Christ being nailed to the cross, as against having his arms tied to the cross-beam can be found in John ch 20.  This is the post-resurrection story about Doubting Thomas.  There appears to be no other gospel reference. Possibly other references might be found in prophetic utterances under Isaiah.  Thomas’s statement and Jesus’ response are respectively:  “Unless I can see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe. … ”  “Put your finger here; look, here are my hands.  Give me your hand; put it into my side. … ”  Jn 20:25-27.\nThe Greek word (transliterated) used here for “hand(s)” is ‘kefir’s, lit hand.  Ian Wilson makes the point that the word also includes the wrist.  We see an example of this in Acts 12:7, when Peter escapes from prison.  “and all the chains fell off his wrists”.  The same word ‘kefir’s is used.  The four major reputable English translations of John 20, all use the word hand.  However at Acts 12:7, three of them use wrist, and only the New Revised American Bible use hand at Acts 12:7.  The three that translate ‘kefir’s as wrists at Acts 12:7 are: NRSV, Revised English, New Jerusalem.\nSomebody may be able to check a copy of the Latin Vulgate, and I would speculate that Jerome translated the Greek as “manus” rather than “carpus”.  Consequently generations of artists have shown portrayals of the crucifixion with nails through the palms of the hands rather than the wrists. \n2.  Height of Jesus:  Forensic pathologist Kelly Kearse has recently debunked the myth that 1st c Palestinian men were only 5’-0″ tall, she has an earlier posting on this site covering this matter. \n3: Stigmatists:  It seems that stigmatists generally receive the marks of the crucifixion wounds, in those parts of the body where they personally believed they occurred at Christ’s crucifixion.  Regardless of whether the stigmata are authentic or not, it seems that there are also some psychological elements at work.  It cannot be assumed that Christ’s actual wounds are necessarily the same as those shown on stigmatists.\n\n","date":"May 21, 2012 at 8:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/21/medjugorje-and-the-shroud-and-what-mark-shea-wrote/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Medjugorje and the Shroud and What Mark Shea Wrote"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks for that John, I’ve been wondering about this since last Easter, after I had chased up our local scholar priest who looked into the matter for me and provided the information I’ve shown above.

However John does not say on what side the wound was given.  There are several references in the early Fathers of the Church establishing a tradition that the wound was given on the right side, and this is precisely what analysis of the Shroud image shows. \nNow, the Shroud itself acts as a mirror.  Imagine yourself holding up say a bed-blanket by its corners, and imagine that your bodily image is projected onto the blanket on the side facing you.  This is roughly the way that a Shroud would be draped over a human body. Your right-hand side will be projected onto the.left side of the blanket image. and vice-versa your left-hand side will be projected onto the right side of the blanket, just as looking in a mirror.  On the original Shroud cloth the wound certainly appears to be on the left hand side because of this.  But you need to view it on one of the several photographic negative images to reorient it to the correct view, when the image will then appear correctly on the right-hand side.  Similarly on the Shroud cloth, the right foot appears to be crossed over the left, when in actual fact, the left foot crosses over the right and is therefore in front, also as shown on the Shroud negative photographs. \nThere is quite a lot that can be said about the wound in the side, and forensic pathologist Dr Pierre Barbet conducted several investigations into the various wounds, examining the negative photographs and experimenting with recently dead cadavers and amputated limbs during the 1930s.  His book “A Doctor at Calvary” published in the 1950s is a classic in Shroud forensic literature.  \nHe considers that the cross could not be more than about six foot high as both the crucifixion and the blow itself had to be given by foot soldiers in the execution squad.  The blow itself was not part of the actual execution, but was a legal requirement to establish the fact of death before delivering the body to relatives.  The blow itself seems to have been given by the Roman “lancea”, a long bladed spear, and the size of the wound matches the size of the lancea blade exactly, from various Roman military artifacts which have been recovered. \nDr Barbet discussed the details of the side wound in chapter 7 “The wound to the heart” of his book.  He considers that the blow was delivered above the sixth rib, obliquely but almost horizontally, and the soldier would be seeking to pierce the right auricle of the heart which is always filled with blood.  The water described in John 19:34 is pericardial fluid which would have accumulated in a great amount from the trauma of crucifixion.  Barbet was also a classicist of some ability and is able to support his analysis by reference to considerable Roman military and other sources as well as by his forensic abilities. \nI hope these few notes might give you a better understanding of the various technicalities implicit in your question.\n\n","date":"December 26, 2012 at 4:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/24/merry-christmas-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Merry Christmas Everyone"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis: Tnanks for this – a good terse summary of the situation which set me off on a train of ideas.  Concerning the conflict of values, it is probably endemic to the human situation. I vaguely recall, perhaps in an encyclical, or it may even be in Aquinas, that it is not in man’s nature to seek to do evil as such, but rather that it is in pursuing a perceived good that may result in evil. For example the good that is perceived in liberal secular values is the freedom of choice, and the exercise of individual rights, but which is often devoid of the concomitant obligations that go with such freedoms.  \nIt is interesting that the Catholic Herald article sees more common ground between the traditional values of the Nigerian Archbishop of Jos and those of Vladimir Putin with his Russian Orthodox background, than he has with those of the now entrenched Western secular values. \nConcerning the posted topic, the alleged conflict between science and religion, much of it stems from the extreme polarities on both sides: the biblical literalism of the evangelical wing of religion, and the extreme scientism of the so-called free-thinkers. Truth will not be found in adopting either of these positions.  Religion has been brought into disrepute by extreme evangelicalism and has wounded its credibility. The historical religious conflicts in both Europe and the United Kingdom, had the effect of the various colonies adopting a public policy of secularism.  In NZ for instance this became manifest in the 19th century Education Act which demanded that education in public schools shall be free, compulsory and secular.  The consequence has been that most NZers are religiously ignorant and utterly unaware of the historical influence of Christianity in their heritage, values and culture. It has been left entirely to the churches to educate their congregations in this heritage. \nReligion has also been brought into disrepute by the human failures of more orthodox churchmen, particularly with the media’s focus on anything with a whiff of scandal. Historically, the religious conflicts of the distant past, with the persection and martyrdoms of religious opponents can also be cited. It is an unfortunate legacy, that raises legitimate questions in the minds of the opponents of religion. \nEver since the times of Copernicus and Galileo, there have always been scientists who also found a truth in religion and belief in God, sometimes unconventional, but at least an awarness that there was something more than just the material world of their particular specialty. The orderliness of nature revealed in “Goldilocks Zones” for example persuades many scientists today towards some belief in the inference of creation by design. \nThere is a middle way between science and religion, and one may hope that it may yet be attained. However there can be little hope for compromise where rigidly held extreme views are held entrenched.\n\n","date":"February 20, 2014 at 3:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/20/mixing-believers-scientists-and-many-who-are-both/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Mixing Believers, Scientists and Many Who Are Both."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Emmett you’re thinking ultra-realism in representational art.

One of the evangelists (John, from memory) even attributes movement of the stone to the EQ, but includes an angel in the story. My personal view is that the story of the EQ is not intended as a mere literary device, but was an actual event. It provides a “naturalistic” explanation for the movement of the stone. It’s also possible that the EQ may have had a role in forming the image, such as by the release of radon gas which commonly occurs during EQs, and also possibly by concurrent variations in the geo-magnetic/electric fields.

The TS happens to be one of the very few burial cloths that no longer contain human remains. Clearly the image formed before corruption set in. Are images that form soon after death then eradicated by corruption products. We do not know, because no-one has ever looked, and it has never been researched. \nIt is not necessary to believe that the TS image was caused by naturalistic means, nor is it necessary to believe it was caused by some supernatural agency.  However, before asserting that the image was created by some miraculous means, then one ought to eliminate the possibility of it being caused by some as yet unknown natural process.  To date this has not been done.\nThere are very many amazing cures, such as at Lourdes, and other various wondrous events. However only a very few of those that are examined are eventually declared to be miraculous.  The Medical Councils at both Lourdes and at the Vatican Causes of Saints exercise extreme caution in attesting that examined events have no natural explanation, and only a small percentage are so validated.  That is not to say that other unattested cures may also be miraculous. The TS, arguably the most important relic in Christendom, needs to be approached with similar caution, before making any rash assertions about it. \nConcerning the role of earthquakes in forming the image. I did not say that radon gas caused the image, only that it may have had a role.  This has been researched by Giovanna De Liso in the seismically active area of Piedmont over a period of 12 years. Her efforts are one of the very few cases where I have seen any naturally caused images that appear at all persuasive. She used variously treated cloths, measured the various effects of radon gas, atmospheric conditions, variations in the magnetic and electric fields and so on. It seemed that the presence of iron-bearing rocks were important. She claimed that images only formed under very specific circumstances. She produced images of a snake and a metallic key. Her paper has sometimes been criticised, because these were only small objects. You can find her paper at:\nhttp://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf  \nI am personally inclined to the view that the TS image is what I call a second-order miracle.  That is, Providence so arranged matters that the very many necessary rare conditions that would produce an image, came together at the same time. It may not have required that the Laws of Nature be suspended for it to happen. However, for all we know, it may not be as rare as we might imagine. We need to remember that the image is not that of a glorious resurrected Christ, but is that of a very dead corpse. To my mind that would seem to rule out the likelihood of the image being caused by the Resurrection event.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2013 at 12:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Matthias: I would be prepared to allow that the Shroud image may have been some kind of by-product of the Resurrection process, whatever that might have been. However I see a strong objection to that hypothesis in that the image is that of a corpse. The gospels refer to the appearances of Christ after the Resurrection, St Paul records his own experience of the risen Christ, and in John’s Revelations, the images of Christ are of a triumphant Son of Man in glory.  None of that is consistent in my mind with the image displayed on the Shroud. One of the reasons why there has been such little progress in arriving at a decision on the origins of the image over the last 40 years, is the inaccessibility of the Shroud to scientific enquiry.  In 1978, the nature of the image was quite unknown, apart from a few properties such as the negativity of the image and its apparently 3-D properties caused by its variations in brightness.  This last is I think strongly suggestive of a possibly naturalistic cause. In 1978, it was not even known if the image was a product of painting or not.  Since then, the Shroud has been largely inaccessible to further enquiry. Investigations have since been confined to very small samples of threads only. I mentioned De Liso’s investigations above, which I think demonstrate that a naturalistic cause may be feasible, and there have been a few other suggestive although less successful attempts as well. As previously mentioned, I’m inclined to consider that the image may be what I have called a seond-class miracle, in that Providence so arranged matters, that the particular circumstances that would produce a naturally caused image combined to do so. We do not even know if in fact whether it is normal for images to form on burial cloths or not, only to be obliterated by subsequent corruption, because no-one has ever bothered to research it.  There are one or two other cases, not as spectacular as the Shroud image, where images were known to form by deceased persons.  The image on the Shroud is not perfect, and there a few gometrical distortions. This would tend to argue against a miraculous cause of the image, which one would expect to show a high level of perfection if it were indeed miraculous.\n\n","date":"September 18, 2013 at 4:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Academia as such has not a good track record when it comes to taking the TS seriously, ever since the time of Yves Delage in 1902.  It has been mainly left as a field for individual scholars who had sufficient enthusiasm for it.  When it comes to the wider religious aspect, there seems to be a dichotomy.  For example, most New Zealand universities have a Religious Studies department, and there are opportunities for obtaining a major, and post-graduate qualifications.  I suspect most of these tend to be studied on a phenomenological basis in their general approach. However I also suspect that enrolments in the RS departments are probably fairly small, and would have little influence within the wider university campus. Back in the 1980s I obtained a RS major from Massey University in Palmerston North, which I found to be particularly broadening and enlightening. Both Auckland and Otago Universities offer courses in Biblical Studies for a B Theol degree, and again there are opportunities for post-graduate studies. The various church seminaries also have their curricula of course, but these would usually have vocational and ministerial objectives, rather than academic.  The general university approach in our present age has tended to become in my view far too compartmentalised and narrow, diected at specific occupational training, and truly educated people with a broad range of knowledge and understanding have now become a rarity. I have cited the NZ experience, which is what I know, but I dare say the situation is not much different in other westernised countries.\n\n","date":"September 15, 2013 at 5:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/15/more-scientific-research-on-the-shroud-of-turin-why/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"More scientific research on the Shroud of Turin? Why?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"You may believe it if you so wish, and you may offer it as an opinion, and you may even be right.

The Catholic Church, having learnt its lesson from the Galileo case were one of the few institutions that were prepared to accept Steno’s theories.  Steno became disenchanted with the bickerings within the scientific establishments of his time, entered Holy Orders and lived a life of extreme frugality.

We know that the heaviest element that can be produced by nuclear synthesis in the sun is Iron, about half-way through the Periodic Table.  The other heavier elements can only be produced by an explosive super nova.  From the known constant speed of light, the rate of recession of remote galaxies and the limits of our visibility, we know that the universe is roughly 14 billion years old, about three sun lives.  We are in fact made of star-dust! \nNone of this was known to the ancient patriarchs, nor the writers of the New Testamment and it has only become known to us in the last few hundred years, or even less.  They had a calling to communicate the Word of God, and this had to be done within a comprehensible cultural context of their time and place.  To God, a million years is but a day, in fact there is no time with God, – everything for God is NOW, our ancient past and our unknown future!  Who can know the mind of God?  \nThe Old Testament was not written down complete and “issued” once and for all at one paricular time.  It was a process that took some thousands of years, from ancient folk stories told around camp fires, through the monotheism of Abraham, the Exodus and wanderings through the desert, the Davidic dynasty, the Babylonian exile, and the triumphalism of the Macchabees.  There is poetry and music there in the Psalms and the Canticles of Canticles, there are guides to proper behaviour in the Proverbs and Wisdom selections, There is a call to repentance in the prophets, and there is a history of a peoples on their way to God. \nThe original Creation story is in chapter 2 of Genesis.  It is a primitive story, God is seen as anthropomorphic, He walks in the Garden, and talks, He asks questions “Where are you?”, He forms the woman from a rib taken from Adam.  We have a talking snake.  Around 540 BC, the banished exiles encountered Babylonian science, and so reformulated a more elevated story of Creation which we find now placed in Chapter 1 of Genesis.  However they were not about to abandon the truths they felt were contained in the ancient story of Chapter 2, and retained it.  They heard of the flood stories such as those in the Epic of Gilgamesh, resulting from random unpredictable flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates.  They took this story, gave it a divine meaning to their purposeful God, and incorporated it into their ancient story of Noah.   \nWhen we come to the Shroud, it remains a scientific mystery.  Some see it as primary evidence of the Resurrection, a fifth gospel, a love letter from Jesus, comprehensible only in our own time with our technology.  Modern man imagines he knows better than the ancients, dismisses the old religion as myths now irrelevant, “God is dead!” The guide to proper behaviour, if there is such thing, is enlightened self-interest.

One of these concerned “Religious Freedom” which Pell saw as being threatened by a secular agenda, promoted by Race Discrimination Commissioner. Tom Calma in September 2008.  A sample of Cardinal Pell’s approach to this issue: \n“In case there was any doubt about the matter, in August Mr Calma and Conrad Gershevitch delivered a conference paper on the inquiry which opened with these words: “The compatibility of religious freedom with human rights is the subject of the most comprehensive study ever undertaken in Australia in this area. …’”\n“Let us spell this out.  The clear meaning of these words is that religious freedom is not a human right and may not be compatible with human rights.  This is an astonishing claim from a senior officer of the body responsible for the protection and advancement of human rights in Australia.

He categorises three types: a) God does something that nature cannot do; b) God does something that nature can do but in a different order;  c) God does something that nature can do but without the operation of the natural principles.   \nThe Catholic position seems to be that Catholics are required to believe in miracles, but beyond those contained in the Creeds, are not normally required to believe in specific miracles as an article of faith.  The Church may recognise specific miracles, such as when examining the causes of saints, but these are not usually compelling on Catholics.  \nIn considering the reported miracles of Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament, it needs to be remembered that the gospels and other writings were written for the purpose of proclaiming Jesus as Lord, and all may not necessarily have occurred as actual events.  Thus we may readily accept the miracles reported as cures or exorcisms, but we may have a mental reservation about such reported miracles as the conversion of water into wine at Cana, Jesus walking on water, the multiplication of loaves and fishes, or the calming of the storm.  There may have been other explanations, or they may have been the particular author’s interpretation of actual events that occurred. \nHaving said all that, it is within the power of God as author of nature, to set aside the laws of nature that He has devised. \nThe evidence of witnesses may be compelling, as seems to have been the case of Fatima in Portugal on 13 October 1917: \n“Anywhere between 70,000 and 100,000 people, who were gathered at a cove near Fátima, witnessed the sun dim, change colors, spin, dance about in the sky, and appear to plummet to earth, radiating great heat in the process. After the ten-minute event, the ground and the people’s clothing, which had been drenched by a previous rainstorm, were both dry.”   \nIt might be asserted that the cause was a mass hallucination, but this explanation seems unlikely, and merely begs the question.  Such hallucination would normally demand a high level of uniform hypnotic suggestion, and would normally be more diverse in what was reported as observed.\n\n","date":"September 13, 2014 at 4:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/13/mystery-is-never-ever-proof-of-anything/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Mystery is never ever proof of anything"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Been there!

When it comes to gnostic and other ancient writings (scribblings?) you need to know that they are sometimes deliberately obscure.  For example:  “Is the writer wanting to make a claim that is to be literally interpreted?  Or was he intending it to be interpreted allegorically?  Is the wife intended to be a person?

It is obviously a gnostic work.  Prof Watson claims to recognise that the Coptic fragment has been compiled from a copy and paste of bits and pieces from a Coptic translation of the Gospel of Thomas, and therefore asserts it is a forgery.  Hopefully a chemical analysis of the ink will settle the matter one way or the other.\nThe gnostic gospels are not the only “scripture” to be obscure.  John’s gospel was written towards the end of the 1st C, during an intense period of persecution, and consequently we can expect a sub-text to have been written into it.  Albert Dreisbach for instance in a Shroud Conference paper, Atlanta 2005, asserts that there is a hidden message concerning Jesus’ burial cloths in the resuscitation story of Lazarus, which only occurs in John. \nMark’s gospel is much more primitive and tells his story in a more direct way.  It his gospel that identifies the names of the brothers of Jesus and his trade as a woodworker.  Matthew’s and Luke’s gospels are rather more circumspect.  From the Greek word used for brother (adelphos), John P Meier asserts that they were blood brothers of Jesus, not half-brothers or cousins.  My own view of this is that they could easily have been adopted by Mary and Joseph.  Adoption was very prevalent in those times because of parents’ early mortality.  There were several orphans, and adoption gave precisely the same rights as blood under both Jewish and Roman law.  That is one reason why I would be prepared to concede that Jesus himself may have adopted a son and there may be more to the inscriptions on the Talpiot ossuaries that many are prepared to admit.  He may well have been the disciple whom Jesus loved.  The whole business of the Talpiot ossaries was very badly handled archaeologically by the IAA, (merely in the interests of expediting a residential development) and now we shall never know because of their cleaning of the ossuaries and disposal of the contents in a common grave.  Consequently I see the controversy concerning the James ossuary as an IAA exercise in futile damage control and covering their backsides. \nNotwithstanding the words of Pope John Paul II on the issue of ordaining women, it was to be expected that Jesus would appoint men only as his disciples because of the prevalent culture of the time and place, not for any theological reason.  His own attitude towards women was a revolutionary breakthrough, and in the Acts it is apparent that women were occasionally appointed as deacons, and not merely in passive supportive roles.  The gnostic gospels, were for what they’re worth, might suggest that Mary Magalene had a very prominent role in missionary activity, which was downplayed by the orthodox.  We shall probably never know for sure.\n\n","date":"September 27, 2012 at 4:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/26/national-post-quality-punditry-from-across-the-globe/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"National Post: Quality punditry from across the globe"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Congratulations, Andy;  That is great news!

In Saudi Arabia, they may not be licensed to drive, and in public must always be accompanied by a man, such is the retention of an archaic desert nomadic morality.  In Afghanistan there has been a continuing battle for the education of young girls, often accompanied with mass slaughter of those who so dare to challenge.  In India in not so distant centuries, it was expected that the widows would also mount the funeral pyre, and if dowries were not as expected the in-laws would persecute the bride.  In African tribal societies, similar subordination is prevalent.  \nI have personal acquaintance with similar perspectives in Maori and Polynesian societies.  A close female relative was to receive an award for her artistic achievements.  Protocol demanded that she be excluded from sitting in the front row with the other recipients, only on account of her gender, and with some distaste I was obliged to sit in her place, although I had little to do with what was her own personal achievement.  Such subordination practices are quite common here in these societies.  However it also seems to continue in certain conservative European societies, the background milieu of most or all 20th century Popes who may thereby be influenced by their upbringing and culture.  Equal status in the workplace and the right to a vote are comparatively recent innovations even in societies we might regard as enlightened.   \nJesus challenged such perspectives, and his relationships with women, engaging them in discussion as recorded in the gospels was a signal departure from the common practices of the time.  However, a female apostle in those times would not be at all practicable and would only give rise to scandal and gossip and was clearly not then achievable.  In the minds of many of those times there might well have been an unwarranted association with the temple prostitution of pagan cults.  In fact it is remarkable that the early church went as far as ordaining women as deacons. \nOf the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human gene, only one pair determines gender, a random accident of the individual’s conception.  Such an accident is a poor indicator of one’s ability to function effectively as any kind of pastor.  I see it as depressing for the Catholic Church that we might yet be overwhelmed by conservative Anglicans, even their bishops, converting on the grounds of their objection to women ordinands.  In Canada and New Zealand, Anglican women priests are not at all uncommon, and in NZ we have seen at least two strikingly effective women Anglican bishops.  \nI cannot see what differences in floppy bits can possibly have to do with the acceptability of women priests or bishops in those cultures prepared to accept them, Papal edicts to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\n","date":"July 1, 2015 at 6:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"AONU: Interesting comments.  When I need to refer to a biblical text when on line, I sometimes find the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) version convenient.  You can find the particular chapter at: http://www.usccb.org/bible/2kings/2  \nI suggest that your seeing a prophetic symbol of the Shroud is no more than an insight personal to yourself.  I would see the mantle as a kind of symbol of Elijah’s prophetic office which now passes to Elisha.  The metaphor of the mantle falling to a successor is common enough even in modern secular language.  A Jerusalem Bible (JB) annotation mentions that the “sons of the prophets” were groups who lived in community, and although Elijah himself was a lone prophet, Elisha seems to have been closely associated with them.  \nJB also comments on Elisha’s request for a double-portion of Elijah’s spirit, as befitting an elder son who inherited a double portion of his father’s goods, even though the prophetic spirit is not inherited but is a gift from God.  JB comments that God indicates that the request is granted by allowing Elisha to see what is hidden from human eyes, while the “sons of the prophets” see only the human circumstances, not the spiritual reality behind them.  The “sons of the prophets” recognise that the spirit has now passed to Elisha, by reason of the mantle, or perhaps by seeing Elisha using it to part the waters.  \nThere are some other interesting annotations at the foot of the USCCB page, which you may like to check out from the link I’ve given above.\n\n","date":"July 3, 2015 at 5:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Re multiverses:  Gabriel may be aware of a particular text, “Parallel Worlds – A journey through creation, higher dimensions, and the future of the cosmos”  Michio Kaku, Doubleday, 2005, recommended reading for anyone interested in such scientific speculations.  In it Kaku has a fascinating Chapter 8 “A Designer Universe?” where he expands on the idea of ‘Goldilocks Zones’, of which there are several, all persuasive arguments for a designer universe.   He explores the idea of multiverses quite thoroughly.  It seems to be quite a valid proposition, but seems likely to remain only a speculative concept, unless there is a major breakthrough allowing us to penetrate beyond our own universe.  The “anthropic principle” invoked by some seems to say little more than “We’re here because we’re here”, hardly a remarkable insight. \nThe historic changes in human understanding of reality has I think influenced modifications to our understanding of religious matters, often for the better.  Genesis chapter 2 was the first of the biblical creation stories, an anthropomorphic God, a desert nomad camp-fire story perhaps, but with a difference from other contemporary creation stories in that God was a separate being from His creation.  The Babylonian exile ~540 BC exposed the early Israelites to more scientific concepts, and they wrote a more compelling story of creation which we now find in Genesis chapter 1, apparently influencing Augustine, but they still did not throw out the older story.  \nIt gave us a three tiered universe;  above the earth in the sky was the abode of the gods and the heavenly host;  below was Sheol the abode of the dead and the demons.  Despite any advances in Greek astronomy the three-tiered concept remained intact well into medieval times, infuencing such writers as Dante, until finally put to rest by Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler.  \nThe old Genesis stories remained dogma, even influencing men of science.  Niklaus Steno was obliged against his better judgment to compress his discoveries of stratigraphy into a period of 6000 years, and could find few to support him otherwise.   However Laplace’s dogmatic determinism was dealt the death blow by the discoveries in quantum mechanics, where outcomes became matters of probability.  \nCharles Darwin’s theories posed more challenges for traditional concepts of creation, but I think Teilhard de Chardin showed us a better way with his insights.  I am not familiar with Tipler’s writings, but I would affirm that there always needs to be an ongoing dialogue between science and religion.  All new ideas are challenged, as they disturb our comfortable received concepts of reality.  But having been tested in the crucible, the truth will always emerge.  \nI have few problems with the concept of transubstantiation.  We are not the same people we were as recently as seven years ago, not a single atom of us.  If God can renew the material reality of every human being on earth in that space of time, then it can be no problem for His Christ to be truly present in a piece of consecrated bread, nor in a chalice of wine, any appearances to the contrary.\n\n","date":"June 30, 2015 at 4:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“I will not go quietly into the night…”:\nA misquote from the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas 1914-1953, best known for his brilliant classic radio play “Under Milk Wood’, a day in the life of a small Welsh village.

But I suspect that rather more is required.  His paper “A NEW CYCLIC-LOADS MACHINE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF MICRO-MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SINGLE FLAX FIBERS COMING FROM THE TURIN SHROUD” by Giulio Fanti, Pierandrea Malfi;  can be found at:\nhttps://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aimeta-fanti.pdf   And he has some good citations of earlier work by various ones. \nThe paper has considerable technical content which may be difficult for some.  Essentially the concept is that the cellulose degrades with time, and by calibrating against properties of known ages of cloths, an estimate of the sample’s age can be made.  A significant problem is that time is not the only dependent variable, but also the history of the cloth, its storage, handling, humidity, also affect these properties.  My recollection is that he tested some four separate parameters, and there was a considerable spread of the various estimated ages.  His attempts at measuring the age of his TS samples seems to be generally considered inconclusive by most reviewers, as far as I know, although he asserted his results were at least consistent with 1st century provenance.  \nA significant problem will always be the reluctance of relics’ guardians to allow the release of samples from intact relics, because of a natural enough wish to preserve the integrity of the relic.  This will always seem to make adequately representative sampling a difficult issue.  There is clearly a preference for non-destructive testing methods. \nSome, including the late Ray Rogers, considered that the presence of a starch coating on the TS fibres indicated that the TS was of ancient provenance, because of the change in linen production methods in medieval times which left no such coating. Rogers also considered that the absence of vanillin was another indicator. \nClearly much more is required than what has been achieved to date, and it may well come.  Nevertheless it is one matter to determine the age of the cloth, but even if it was proved to be first century, there would still be those skeptics who would assert that the image was produced by some medieval artisan, by some means as yet unknown! \nMuch more scientific work and historical research, on several fronts is required.  Access to the relic hampers scientific testing.  Time and the inevitable destruction of any records that may once have provided clues hampers historical research.

Frankly I prefer a phenomenological approach, such as that taught in the better Religious Studies departments, and which tends to be more comprehensive in its understanding of Religions generally.  It seems to be a trend within the history of philosophy that whenever it pontificated about some esoteric topic, that the topic became specialised in a way that proved more successful outside Philosophy’s hallowed halls.  It was true of Aristotle’s Physics for example, and I think it is very likely true of Religion.  The philosopher’s approach often seems to be narrow, even reductionist, with what seems to be the Philosopher’s emphasis on “knowledge”, and the “nature of knowledge” where it might better apply itelf.  What modern philosophy has to say about religion is a far cry from St Thomas’ Summa Theologica for instance, notwithstanding Professor Gutting’s 12 years of training with the Jesuits, and his instructing of Catholic students at a prestigious university.  \nHis criteria for evaluating religions:  “the three great human needs religions typically claim to satisfy: love, understanding, and knowledge” are just too reductionist for me, and I doubt if I can agree that,this is what religions are indeed about.  There is nothing here for instance of the divine, the spiritual, the otherness, little about the role of social cohesion, or sense of community, or “The Idea of the Holy” (e.g. Rudoph Otto), the numinous, the mysterium tremendum, or the cosmic and the ultimate end of humanity.  It is little more than a warm fuzzy!   \nProfessor Gutting is apparently a specialist authority on the work of Michel Foucault, who along with Jaques Derrida have both been an unfortunately powerful influence in much of 20th century thought and development, but who have also been variously described as two French clowns who contributed little that was worthwhile, whenever it did occur to them to be at least comprehensible.  I doubt that Michel Foucault ever had anything of worthwhile utility to say about Religion.  If modern Philosophy has anything at all useful to say about Religion, it would very likely be confined to commenting on the nature of religious knowledge, and very little else, a very circumscribed aspect indeed.\n\n","date":"January 23, 2013 at 7:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/23/philosophy-the-way-of-the-agnostic-and-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Philosophy: The Way of the Agnostic (and the Shroud)"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There are known facts, there are speculations, and there are interpretations.

But that is not the reality of where many people seeking a faith happen to be at.  What should one say to these – “Sorry, that it is all or nothing – you’re either in it totally or you’re out!”  That does not seem to me to be the truly Christian approach.  For many, the fulness of faith is something that can develop over a period of time.  We get a hint of this in Matthew’s gospel, 19:1-9, where the Pharisees question Jesus about divorce.  They asked: “Then why did Moses command that a writ of dismissal should be given in cases of divorce?” Jesus replied “It was because you were so unteachable that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but it was not like this from the beginning.”  I think we see here that there can be degrees of commitment, according to the capability of the person, even though it is not the way of perfection.  \nAs I’ve indicated above, I’m not at all happy with Professor Gutting’s approach, that all religions are about “the three great human needs … love, understanding and knowledge”.  That to me is too anthropocentric, and is not what religion is about at all.  As my local pastor is so fond of saying: “It’s not about me; It’s not about you; It’s all about God!”  But that is a way of perfection, and many of us are still children in the faith.  However the God-centric approach does not appear to be part of Prof Gutting’s consideration at all in what he has recently posted, but perhaps he is providing a way for the tepid or agnostic.\n\n","date":"January 24, 2013 at 11:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/23/philosophy-the-way-of-the-agnostic-and-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Philosophy: The Way of the Agnostic (and the Shroud)"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I watched the video right through, and it was OK, coverage of basic forensics was adequately dealt with, but no mention of the possibility of a naturalistic process, and they clearly attribute the image to the Resurrection event,  In view of John Calvin’s rejection of the Shroud image (he considered it unthinkable that it wouldn’t be mentioned in the gospel accounts, if true) it is interesting that many Evangelical Christians are now showing an interest in it.  The PITN folks are an off-shoot of the “Church of God” movement, which had very fragmented beginnings, and quickly divided into various assorted sects.  Part of the problem was the life-style of a few of the founders, which involved frequent serial adulteries, and mishandling of their finances – check “Church of God” in Wiki and elsewhere.  I’d tend to agree with Dan’s comment that the present PITN movement.seems to be profit driven (profits from prophecy) with its emphasis on sale of books and conventions, but they wouldn’t haven’t this fault on their own.

The Allies’ northward advance up the Italian peninsula to Rome was still blocked by Kesselring’s Gustav Line, which was hinged on Monte Cassino.  A mass landing to bypass Cassino, had occurred to the north at Anzio, but time spent in consolidating these forces allowed Kesselring’s reserves to develop a powerful counteroffensive, reducing this attack to a shallow beach-head. \nThe decision to bomb the historic Cassino monastery was a difficult one, was controversial, and not made lightly.  I recall discussing the issue in the 1960s with a work colleague, a veteran of the Cassino campaign.  He told me that it was plain the German army was occupying the monastery, and using it as an unassailable defence fortification.  Vehicle wheel marks were clearly visible on the ground and appeared over several nights showing evidence of their troop movements, and eventually the decision to bomb was taken.   \nThe comment that several Savoy family documents concerning the Shroud were destroyed is significant, and of course one wonders what they might have contained.  I think it renders somewhat fatuous the demands of purist historians for documentation as proof for various assertions made, when it is plain that many such key documents have over the course of centuries been lost in vary many suchlike actions.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2015 at 2:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/20/picture-tweet-of-the-day/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Picture Tweet of the Day"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Rick’s comments are I think somewhat naive. Historically, the churches’ position on a social option for the poor and oppressed has been uneven. It has ranged from an outlook that has promoted a philosophy of passive Christian patience, forbearance and acceptance of one’s lot to the then somewhat radical but essentially conservative social teaching of Pope Leo XIII, sometimes described as the Catholic Church’s “best kept secret”.  \nThe Industrial Revolution of the 19th century led to the gross exploitation of the working classes, not only male workers but women and children as well, at the behest of capitalist profit. There have always been extreme right wing regimes oppressing the poor for similar reasons.  These factors inevitably led to the teachings of Karl Marx who saw Religion as the opiate of the poor, their only available refuge. The response of the churches to these conditions has often seemed ambiguous.\nThe Liberation Theology of the late 20th century as one solution to these problems was often condemned. In South America some Catholic churchmen joined underground revolutionary movements and took up arms to fight against reactionary government forces, fifty Bolivian priests openly espoused armed revolution, and a group of Maryknoll priests and nuns assisted Guatemalan guerrillas. There is a diversity of theological commitment, but also a unity of shared concerns and theological perspectives. \nAn excellent essay on the topic by Ernest Wallwork can be found in the textbook “Critical Issues in Modern Religion” – ‘Christians in the Revolution of the Oppressed’. \nThe extreme religious escapism evident in Filipino flagellations and self-crucifixions, and by similar devotional excesses elsewhere I do not see as a minority practice such as the snake handlers of some southern USA groups, but as a more general outlet of religious expression and social frustration. \nI see the sermon of Pope Francis as a signal, and hopefully heralding a repositioning and coming of age of a theology and option for the poor and oppressed.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2013 at 5:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/04/pope-francis-we-encounter-the-living-god-through-his-wounds/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Pope Francis: We encounter the Living God through His wounds"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I have for many years considered that the heart of the Christian message is contained in the text of Matthew 25:31-46, although the other evangelists don’t seem to make it quite so explicit. It paints the scene of the Last Judgment when the Son of Man comes in his glory, escorted by all the angels, and separates the sheep from the goats. The essential criterion are the corporal works of mercy: “Come … For I was hungry and you gave me food; I was thirsty and you gave me drink; (etc)”.  This seems to be the main theme of the present sermon of Pope Francis.  He associates it with putting your hands into the wounds of Christ, maybe “getting your hands dirty” would be an Anglophile way of expressing it.  It is also significant I think that this text immediately precedes the Passion narrative, when Christ incurs those wounds. \nComing from Pope Francis with his South American background it is a refreshing re-emphasis of the core of this Christian message. The Latin population expressions of religion have often in the past seem to have been marked by extreme mortifications, such as the Lenten flagellations and personal self crucifixions, seen in these countries. Meditation and other expressions of personal piety has also, I think, tended to have been over-emphasised, at the expense of this reaching out to those with real suffering. Yes, fasting, prayer, penance and meditation all have their place, but need not be taken to such extremes that they displace the real caring and reaching out on which we will be finally judged. Such works as those of Mother Theresa of Calcutta, the work of the St Vincent de Paul Society, founded by Blessed Frederick Ozanam, and the personal or institutional efforts of many Christians, such as nursing, missionary charity, prison chaplaincy, are various ways in which this message can be realised.\n\n","date":"July 4, 2013 at 6:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/04/pope-francis-we-encounter-the-living-god-through-his-wounds/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Pope Francis: We encounter the Living God through His wounds"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Does that include cat-fish?

In the gospel of Matthew, the disciple named as Levy the tax collector in Mark, is changed to Matthew, presumably to give this gospel apostolic authority.  \nPapias writing in the second century says that Mark was Peter’s amanuensis (secretary), although one of the Fathers also says that Papias is a person of very little brain (I think it was Irenaeus).  In the concluding verse of I Peter, apparently written by Sllvanus at Peter’s behest, “my son Mark .. (sends you greetings)”.  However some authorities dispute this, as I Peter is written in the best Greek (i.e. not Galilean – although Silvanus might be competent).  So the guarantor of Marks’ gospel is said to be Peter. \nLuke’s gospel is said to have been written by the companion of Paul, and frequently addresses gentiles.  Encyc Brit ,makes the following comments: ” … style of this preface follows the pattern of Greek historiography, and thus Luke is called the “historical” Gospel. Historically reliable information cannot be expected, however, because Luke’s sources were not historical; they rather were embedded in tradition and proclamation.  Luke is, however, a historian in structuring his sources, especially in structuring his chronology into periods to show how God’s plan of salvation was unfolded in world history. …” \nEncyc Brit makes the following comments about John’s gospel:  “Irenaeus calls John the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel in Ephesus. Papias mentions John the son of Zebedee, the disciple, as well as another John, the presbyter, who might have been at Ephesus. From internal evidence the Gospel was written by a beloved disciple whose name is unknown.”  Thus it cannot be assumed that it was the disciple John who wrote the gospel of that name.  One hypothesis is that John’s gospel and the epistles of that name were written and edited by a Johnannine school in Ephesus towards the end of the 1st century.  There is much debate among the authorities, and it seems nothing is certain. \nAn enlightening insight into the varying purposes of the gospels is arrived at by asking the question “When does Jesus become the son of God?”  In Mark’s gospel, it is when the Holy Spirit descends on him at his baptism by John in the Jordan.  In Matthew’s and Luke’s gospel it is at his conception.  In John’s gospel, it is from the beginning of time “In the beginning was the Word”  so each one of the gospels has its own particular intent and focus.

The Synoptic gospels attempt to connect the Last Supper with the Passover meal may have been a late stage insertion, and for the Synoptic evangelists a symbolic passover meal.  John asserts that the Friday was Preparation Day.  This made the actual Passover fall on the sabbath and consequently of particular solemnity that year.  It’s the main reason why the three bodies could not stay on their crosses beyond the Friday.  There are two years that fit the bill, either 30AD or 33AD.  \nThere are only four major chronological events that give us any indication of when significant dates in Jesus’ life occurred.  These are: (1) his birth – about 6BC or 7BC,  a few years before the death of Herod the Great in 4 BC; (2) John the Baptist commences his preaching in the 15th year of Tiberius – depending on the method of counting this is sometime between Sept, 27AD to Aug, 29AD; (3) Pontius Pilate procurator 26 – 36AD; (4) Jesus dies on a Friday which is also Preparation Day when Pilate is procurator. \nMeier concludes that the date is Friday, April 7, 30AD.  Essentially it depends on how long Jesus’ ministry lasted commencing with John the Baptist’s preaching, and Jesus’ death.  Reading the Synoptics, it’s only about 18 months.  In John, Jesus goes up to Jerusalem from Galilee, for a number of great feasts, probably when there would be large crowds.  Meier concludes that the ministry lasted 2 years and a few months.  Only if the ministry was some three years longer, could the 33AD date be accepted as the year of Jesus’ death.\n\n","date":"May 26, 2012 at 7:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/26/quake-reveals-day-of-jesus-crucifixion-or-something-like-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quake Reveals Day of Jesus’ Crucifixion (or something like that)"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I didn’t think it was directed at you but to another!\n\n","date":"April 27, 2013 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/25/quote-for-today-better-to-be-proven-a-fraud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today:  Better to be Proven a Fraud?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"JK:  Thanks for your comments John.  Here at the end of the world, our music groups still occasionally sing that hymn at Mass – the full force of the conservative reaction now prevalent elsewhere has still a little way to go in NZ.  I remember the hymn being very popular in various youth and family groups during the 1960s. \nJV:  I believe that one only sees contradictions in the gospels if you fall into the trap of interpreting them literally.  To do this one ignores the literary artistry that is a gospel.  Each one of the evangelists has his own purpose in writing a gospel.  Both infancy narratives place their birth stories in Bethlehem, to suit a “prophecy” that the Messiah will be born there.  It is quite likely that Jesus was actually born in Nazareth.  Matthew does not even know that Nazareth is the home town of Joseph and Mary, and mentions no stable nor inn.  Matthew’s purpose is at least two-fold – his gospel is intended to include the gentiles, so he has wise men coming from the east, and includes Ruth a Moabite in the genealogy; he also wants to present Jesus as the new Moses and uses several devices to show this.  He wants to bring him out of Egypt, so has to have a reason for getting him there first.  The Last Supper was not a Passover meal, but a farewell meal, which symbolically became associated with the Seder.  And so on. \nMeier’s text is extremely authoritative, and has been cited by Pope Benedict in some of his writings.  It was partly written as a reponse to tendencies in the Jesus Seminar group.  You can probably find Meier’s credentials on the web. At the time of writing his book 1991, the jacket blurb included the following: \n“John Paul Meier is a Biblical scholar and Catholic priest. He attended St. Joseph’s Seminary and College (B.A., 1964), Gregorian University [Rome] (S.T.L, 1968), and the Biblical Institute [Rome] (S.S.D., 1976).  Meier is the author of nine books and more than 60 scholarly articles. He was editor of The Catholic Biblical Quarterly and president of the Catholic Biblical Association.

The campaign was a major influence in shaping a sense of national identity in both countries.  We are seeing several TV documentaries and magazine articles from archives and records of soldier’ memories.  Recently there have been documentaries on the chaplains’ roles. \nIt seems that during both world wars, it was a common practice before battle for the Catholic padres accompanying the troops on the front lines to invite all who wanted to receive Holy Communion beforehand, regardless of their religious affiliation.  In fact the relationship between all the different padres generally seems to have been cordial and cooperative.  When the troops returned home after cessation of hostilities, they were disappointed to discover that the old sectarian differences had again resurfaced, and that the unity of purpose once evident in the thick of battle against the common enemy had now been set aside.  Some commentators have attributed this apparent hypocrisy as being one cause of a falling away from religion that occurred during the 20th century from the 1920s onward.   \nPerhaps we are seeing more of a sense of unity between the churches now, initiated by Pope John XXIII, and followed up by his successors, and also by the Second Vatican Council.  \nIn Wellington there is an Ataturk memorial, commemorating the conciliatory attitude of Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey, and victorious commander of the Turkish forces at Gallipoli.  It was largely through his efforts that has enabled access to the many ANZAC war graves there.  However in modern Turkey, it is now a different story, where the trend to Islamisation away from a secular state, seeks to downgrade the memory of Ataturk, and to attribute the Turkish victory solely to the will of Allah.  Such are the fickle perceptions and reactions of humankind, forgetful of the past, and mindful only of the aspirations of a moment.\n\n","date":"May 25, 2015 at 8:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/24/rejecting-authenticity-out-of-hand/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rejecting Authenticity Out of Hand"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Correction & elucidation, last para, last three lines: It might be said that the only truth that gnostic scriptures contain is the evidence they provide on what the particular gnostic circle claimed to believe.

Until then the only serious work had been the forensic pathology examination of the photographs of Pia(1898) by Vignon and Delage, and of Enrie(1931) by Barbet, Bucklin and Willis. The work of the 1969 Commission was all done in secret, the names of the participants not even being known until 1973.  Nearly all of them were chosen from the diocese of Piedmont, although all reasonably expert in their particular specialties. They were not all Catholics, but included agnostics and Protestants.  The nature of the cloth was not even known until Raes was able to confirm that it was indeed linen of a particular flax, and with some contamination of cotton. In 1973, Frei was commissioned to offer some photographic advice, based on his reputation in police investigation work. Frei was able to take the opportunity only then of collecting his first pollen samples. The findings of the 1973 commission were necessarily limited by the constraints of the intended scope of their work.\nThe impetus for the STURP team possibly originated with the discovery of the 3-D properties of the photographs using the VP8 analyser, and the decision of a few American scientists to attempt exploiting the opportunity of the intended 1978 ostentation. At this stage the nature of the image was completely unknown.  Barrie Schworz was recruited to join the team. He tells of his anticipation of a free trip to Turin and expectation that it was no more than a painting and that would be the end of it.  But of course that was not to be, and the rest is history. Such was the state of ignorance even as late as 1978.  \nThe setting of the 1988 C14 Radiocarbon dating was fraught with conflicts of egos, thwarted intentions of sampling protocols, the scepticism of some custodial authorities, the ignorance of so-called experts in textiles and other disciplines, and an assortment of various personal and professional agendas, and finally the selection of a totally unrepresentative sample.  Few I feel could come out of the whole sorry exercise with any kind of worthwhile credit at all. \nWhat assurances can there ever be that human egos can be set aside, and a proper disciplined professional approach to any future scientific investigation can ever be achieved?  Is it possible for human subjectivity to be set aside in any such investigation? Or will fallen human nature, with all its personal ambitions and agendas, always compromise what ought to be a proper objective assessment of this most important treasure?\n\n","date":"October 11, 2013 at 6:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/10/responding-directly-to-colin-berry/","cat":"science","title":"Responding Directly to Colin Berry"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Wiki article on this gnostic gospel is comprehensive and informative. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Judas \nIreneus mentions a “Gospel of Judas” in his “Against Heresies” 180AD, and it seems quite likely that his reference may have been to an earlier Greek version of this Coptic copy which dates to the 3rd-4th centuries. It follows a common gnostic practice of being in dialogue form rather than  narrative form as in the canonical gospels, although note the long discourse sections in John ch 13-17. [John’s gospel was suspected of showing gnostic tendencies until about 180 AD, and Eastern Orthodoxy remains hostile towards the Book of Revelations.] \nThe only known commentaries on gnosticism until the mid-20th century were those as filtered by the naturally hosile proto-Nicene fathers, and access to these early maunscripts following the Nag-Hammadi discoveries has led to a greater understanding of what the various forms of gnosticism were about. Elaine Pagels of course has written extensively about them, but of course she is known to have her own singular view about them.  \nPersonally, as a some-time student of general Religious Studies, I consider them of value in throwing light on what the various gnostic sects believed, and they are also informative of an apparent evolutionary trend for religious movements to fracture in various ways towards sectarianism. Following the lead of Ireneus, orthodox Christianity will always show hostility towards such manuscripts as they are clearly heretical. It might be said that the only truth they contain is what the particular circle happened to believe. This also says something about certain trends in Religion generally.\n\n","date":"April 10, 2013 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/10/remember-the-vinland-map/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Remember the Vinland Map?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My  advice is “Don’t let it beat you, David G.”  Keep on keeping on if you can.

It is certainly considered as such by its owners, and by a very large catchment of Christians throughout the world. It is not a “laboratory specimen” – It is unique.  It is true, as he ssys, that this subjective value necessarily influences what can be done and not done in any scientific investigation. For instance, it constrains the amount of destructive testing that might be carried out. \nNor were normal laboratory conditions with its more usual lack of time constraints available to the STURP team.  The programmes they formulated had to be planned so as to be completed within whatever time would be allowed to them. Shortly before their departure, the custodial authorities asked that their “12 hour programme” be sent; in response they sent their 96 hour protocol instead.  It was clear that Turin politics were at work, another hurdle they had to deal with.  There were delays in arrival of essential equipment. The Italian Customs authorities also impounded the equipment, merely because of the standard radiation sticker on their X-ray machines.

You will also be aware of De Liso’s work on the effects of earthquakes on testing of image formation to which I have often referred. \nThe authors speculate about a devastating earthquake in Jerusalem for which I think there is scant evidence and is unnecessary. A moderate earthquake is quite capable of tossing rocks about. Earthquakes have not affected the C14 dating of any other object, and it is highly speculative and dubious to assert that it affected the Shroud dating, when other more credible explanations for skewing the date are available (e.g. cotton contamination of C14 sample). \nThe late Ray Rogers gave strong arguments as to why the Shroud image was not caused by radiation of any kind.  The release of radon gas during seismic activity together with other seismic effects, such as variations in geo-magnetic and electric fields may have been a necessary contributing factor but it is questionable as a primary cause.

Ussher was no intellectual slug, was an expert on semitic languages, and remains a highly respected biblical scholar for his time. In particular he is credited with correctly distinguishing authentic and spurious epistles credited to Ignatius of Antioch of the 2nd century. By back-working the biblical genealogies he had calculated the date of Creation during the Saturday evening of October 22, 4004BC, somewhat older than that calculated by Johannes Kepler, who was famous for his laws of planetary motion. \nThe Danish Nicolaus Steno, originally trained in medecine, made major break-throughs in anatomy, including discovering the parotid salivary duct, and other discoveries in anatomy which had remained unchanged since the time of Galen. Appointed as physician to Grand duke Ferdinand in Florence, he became fascinated with the layered limestone strata of Italy. He made major discoveries in crystallography, particularly quartz.   \nSteno was the first to realize that the Earth’s crust contains a chronological history of geologic events and that the history may be deciphered by careful study of the strata and fossils. He rejected the idea that mountains grow like trees, proposing instead that they are formed by alterations of the Earth’s crust.\nMost scientists of his time considered that fossils such as shells either grew in the rocks, or else were the inundation remnants of Noah’s flood, and Steno found little support for his ideas, except from Gottfried Leibniz. Steno was constrained by the religious bigotry of his time to compress his geology into a period of 6000 years. Having learnt their lesson from the Galileo case, the Catholic Church was one of the first institutions to abandon the 6000 year old world history concept. Nevertheless elsewhere the idea survived well into the 18th century. \nDisillusioned with the backbiting and rivalries within science, Steno abandoned it and caught religion, converted to Catholicism (he had worked with the younger Medici family in Florence) took Holy Orders, and was commissioned as the Pope’s envoy to Germany and Scandinavia where he lived and died in extreme voluntary frugality. Pope John Paul II beatified him in 1992, somewhat ironically on October 23 within a day of the same date that Archbishop Ussher had set for the creation of the world.  \nSteno’s biography can be found in Alan Cutler’s “The Seashell on the Mountain Top”, Heinemann 2003. I think the best line in the book is “The summit of Mount Everest is marine limestone!”\n\n","date":"April 24, 2014 at 7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/24/ridiculous-quote-for-today/","cat":"quotations","title":"Ridiculous Quote for Today"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"#2: “The second law does not apply to the evolution of stars or biological evolution.” No scientific authority cited!  \nAt this stage I shall bow out of the debate, which is too far off-topic from this site dedicated to discussing the Holy Shroud of Turin, and go back to putting my faith in Goldilocks zones, and the consequential inference of a designer universe!

What bad science and bad religion seem to share in common is a certain arrogance and lack of humility.  There are certainly any number of examples of bad science.  However, science itself seemed able and bound to accommodate itself when sufficent evidence was mounted to discard older discredited theories.  However the process of getting there was usually fraught with much disputation, often acrimonious.  The phlogiston theory had to give way to Joseph Priestley’s oxygen; Despite the atomic theory being a working hypothesis for chemists from the 18th c. the experimental physicist Ernst Mach was denying the existience of atoms as late as 1905, dirving Boltzman to suicide; Soon afterwards Einstein demonstrated their existence from applying Boltzman’s theories to Brownian movement;  Similarly “conservation of mass” was disproved as an infallible statement from Einstein’s E = mc^2 equation;  Immutability of the elements was altered by Rutherford’s work in radioactivity;  Laplace’s insistence on determinism was dealt a blow by the demonstrable randomness of quantum mechanics.  \nThe debate concerning entropy, may have originated with Teilhard de Chardin’s observation of the development of complexity being an apparently opposing principle.  Many of Teilhard’s forecasts, particularly relating to inter-personal communication have now come to pass.  Nevertheless, the law of increasing entropy has been shown to be true for all observable closed systems, notwithstanding increasing complexity.  However as recently as 1978, Ira Levine was able to state in his text-book “Physical Chemistry” that “There is no guarantee that laws that hold on a terrestial scale must also hold on a cosmic scale.  Although there is no evidence for a cosmic violation of the second law (of thermodynamics) our experience is insufficient to rule out such a violation. (etc)”  op. cit. p.96.  He mentions the discredited steady-state theory of Hoyle et al. \nLevine I think demonstrates the correct attitude of scientific humility.  Michio Kaku in his “Parallel Universes” makes the point that the plethora of “goldilocks” properties, on both the micro and macro scale has persuaded a number of scientists that the universe, and in particular our own solar system, did not eventuate by chance, but rather by cosmic design.  Yet others less credulous take refuge in the invention of the so-called “anthropic principle”. \nAny search of Shroud sceptic sites reveals to all the misplaced “faith in science” of a certain prevalent attitude, together with what appears to be deliberate misinformation, and illustrates well the point that Sheldrake makes in his article.\n\n","date":"December 2, 2012 at 7:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Why does the Huffington Post, on its leading Religion page publish a columnist who on her own admission is not religious, and also on her own admission is ignorant about archaeological religious discoveries, or on any religious matter at all?

I feel that the gentlemen are merely arguing minor details.  The Universe and all that is within it are the product of a Creator God.  How this happened, Science can point the way.  While Dawkins et al might argue that random fluctuations, natural selection and Darwinian survival of the fittest are all that is required to explain our present situation, a more fundamental approach is required.  All that exists in the universe depends on the fundamental properties of matter.  These properties could very well have been somewhat different from what they actually are.  \nA few minor examples:  “In order to create life, our planet must have been stable for hundreds of millions of years.  But such a stable world is extremely difficult to make.  Commencing with matter, if the proton particle were just 1% heavier, all atomic nuclei would be unstable and fly apart, and life would be impossible.  To create DNA, protons must be stable for hundreds of millions of years.  When we look at the four fundamental forces of nature, these are also critical.  If the weak force were either weaker or stronger, then neutrinos could not form supernovae, and there would again be no elements heavier than iron.”  There are many such examples   Any search on “Goldilocks zones” or “Goldilocks properties of matter” can provide persuasive evidence that there is an intelligence which shapes our ends.  Getting lost in the detail provides little further enlightenment.  There is no fundamental reason why the universe should not be otherwise than what it is.  That the universe is what it is, can only point to a Creator God, timeless and omniscient.  The so-called “anthropic principle” sheds no further light except that “We’re here, because we’re here”, hardly a rigorous scientific statement.\n\n","date":"December 5, 2012 at 3:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Opinion may be divided on the matter.

As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases.” \n Entropy & Life: “Organisms inherit the ability to create unique and complex biological structures; it is unlikely for those capabilities to be reinvented or be taught each generation. Therefore DNA must be operative as the prime cause in this characteristic as well. Applying Boltzmann’s perspective of the second law, the change of state from a more probable, less ordered and high entropy arrangement to one of less probability, more order, and lower entropy seen in biological ordering calls for a function like that known of DNA.

The hoax ocurred at Piltdown Common,in Sussex England following a series of discoveries there in 1910-12.  It was one of the most successful scientific hoaxes ever perpetrated, and puzzled scientists for over 40 years, as it appeared to be an anomaly in the evolutionary chain, some referring to it as the missing link,  Further genuine discoveries highlighted the anomaly, and in 1953 a close examination of the Piltdown remains showed them to be a modern cranium, the jaw and teeth of an orangutan, and the tooth of what was likely a chimpanzee, all fraudulently planted in shallow gravels.  The fragments had been deliberately stained with chromium and iron sulfate, and the teeth subjected to artificial abrasion. \nIdentity of the perpretator remained a mystery, Suspects included the discoverer Charles Dawson, motive – seeking admission to Royal Society; a friend of Dawson’s – Samuel Woodhead; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who lived nearby; Sir Arthur Keith prominent in museum circles.  Teilhard worked with Dawson and was also a suspect;  Rev Rutler says Stephen Jay Gould a palaeontologist was convinced of Teilhard’s guilt, but Gould only obtained his PhD in 1960, so could not have been privy to the identity of the hoaxer. \nIn 1996 two British palaeontologists examined contents of a trunk stored at the British museum in 1975, and discovered bones stained exactly the same way as the Piltdown remains.  The trunk belonged to one Martin A C Hinton, keeper of zoology at British Museum in 1936.  Hinton had worked with Dawson in 1912, and his requests for a weekly wage had been rebuffed.  It seemed that Hinton had planted the bones to embarass Dawson, and had used the bones in the trunk to practise on beforehand.  \nSo even reverend gentlemen such as Rev Rutler can poison the well, and besmirch the character of those whose theology they disagree with.  But Teilhard leaves a better legacy than Rutler can ever hope to attain.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2012 at 2:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/06/rutler-the-mainstream-media-falls-for-the-latest-hoax/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rutler: The Mainstream Media Falls for the Latest Hoax"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Our climate in NZ is more benign, though variable.

The Shroud puts the Biblical literalists into a similar bind as it does the skeptics!  Christianity is a product of history and the canon of scripture is the product of the early Church, not the other way round!  The writers of scripture were not concerned to write history in the style of Heredotus or even Josephus, but to proclaim their understanding of the gospel for the congregations of their time.  The Shroud image is not mentioned in the gospels for a very good reason!  It would no doubt have confused and perplexed the Jewish disciples for whom any image was anathema.  Likewise the “unclean” burial cloth was also an embarrassment.  Doubtless they were relieved to send it off to a ‘good home’ in non-Jewish Edessa.  \nNo doubt American Creationists will continue to believe in the literalism of Genesis, and not see it for what it is, an Israelite expression of the truth that God is the Master of Creation;  Our modern understanding that He chose to do this through an evolutionary process does not change this fundamental truth.  I recommend they read “The Seashell on the Mountaintop” by Alan Cutler, Heinemann 2003, the story of Nicolaus Steno, 1638-1686, the founder of modern geology.  The best line in the book is: “The summit of Mt Everest is marine limestone.”  Creationists no doubt believe the devil put it there!  I think Jesus had a similar problem with the Sanhedrin.

I think it means involvement with community.  The Salvation Army and the St Vincent de Paul Society have been doing this for over a hundred years.  The corporal works of mercy come into it.  \nOur great NZ poet James K Baxter set up a commune for waifs and strays at a place called Hiruharama (= Jerusalem) a long way up the Wanganui River which had been a former mission station led by Blessed Mother Mary Aubert (from Lyons). \nIn the foreword of his “Jerusalem Daybook” he tells the story of a certain hermit who bought a large corrugated tank and furnished it with the necessities of life.  There he lived a blameless life without interruption from the world.  But there was one great hardship.  Every morning and evening volleys of bullets would rip through the walls of his tank.  He learned to lie on the floor to avoid being shot, but occasionally sustained wounds;  the walls were pieced by many holes that let in the wind and the daylight and sometimes the rain.  At first he plugged up the holes, but gradually began to use them for a useful purpose.  He began to watch the people passing by, and to see the outside world.  Eventually the tank rusted away and fell to pieces, and he walked out of it with little regret.  There was a man with a gun standing outside.  \n“I suppose you will kill me now” said the hermit, “but I would like to know why have you been persecuting me, why are you my enemy when I have never done you any harm?” \nThe other man laid the gun down and smiled at him.  “I am not your enemy”, he said.  And the hermit saw that there were scars on the other man’s hands and feet, and these scars were shining like the sun.  \nBut Baxter tells the story much better than my brief paraphrase of it.

This is a presumption. It may be that the Shroud image is naturalistic, and one might then expect that if given adequate access to the relic, then Science might some day discover all that is to be known about it.  However in our present state of knowledge it is equally possible that the image has a supernatural origin.  How is the competent scientist of Faith to take account of this very real possibility?  \nDoes he ignore the possibility that it may be miraculous, knowing than that whatever scientific endeavours he persists in may well be fruitless, as his Science may be incapable of providing the answer? Or perhaps he may look for some kind of boundary where Science and the Supernatural might meet? This second path seems to be the one trod by such as Fanti, Carpenteri and Jackson. For various reasons they seem to have discarded the purely naturalistic explanation and seem to be searching for some kind of amalgam of science and the supernatural. Yes, it involves conjecture and speculation and an agnostic scientist is unlikely ever to accept their conclusions. As in all such new ideas they will sometimes go astray, as seems to have been the case with the Carpenteri paper.  But what if they happen to be right in their suspicions that a purely naturalistic explanation will never suffice?  \nIn the absence of adequate experimentation, a purely naturalistic explanation cannot yet be ruled out. I should like to see a concerted programme of experiments with time-expired lab animals to see if it is possible to produce Shroud-like images by naturalistic means. Whether that is indeed possible cannot yet be excluded. \nIn the meantime, other well-meaning attempts to explore the boundaries between science and the supernatural need not be deplored. However, they might be constructively criticised when their unwarranted speculations are asserted as more than just possibilities, and are published as formal papers in scientific journals.

Here goes for about the 12th attempt: \nConcerning the D’Arcy memorandum alleging that the image was painted: \nThe position is clearly set out in Markwardt’s 2001 paper “Conspiracy against the Shroud”, and Wilson 1978 also comments on it.  \nIn 1900 Ulysse Chevalier apparently had available to him a near-finished Latin draft from the Troyes diocesan archives addressed to a Scribe, which would imply that the alleged memorandum was never even sent to the Scribe, let only to Anti-pope Clement VII.  However rather than producing this draft, Chevalier cobbled together a text from prior separate notes, which included editing marks such as marginal notes, cross-outs, and substitute wording, and manufactured for it an end of 1389 date; as by its archival retention it would be clear from the near-finished draft for the scribe that the memorandum had not in fact been sent to Clement.  \nMarkwardt refers to the two source documents: “In 1993, Hilda Leynen discovered that two distinct drafts of the D’Arcis Memorandum were maintained in the Champagne collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, one very rough and containing bracketed words, and the other a relatively neat and polished product.”   \nFrom Chevalier’s cobbled Latin text, Herbert Thurston published an English translation in the Catholic periodical “The Month” in 1903.  Wilson 1978 provides the full text of Thurston’s translation as Appendix B, the fraud apparently even escaping Wilson’s attention.   \nThe relevant text cited by Markwardt is included in his Note 6:\n‘6  The memorandum refers to an alleged investigation conducted, in about 1355, by Henri\nde Poitiers, Bishop of Troyes. “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he\ndiscovered the fraud and how the cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being\nattested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not\nmiraculously wrought or bestowed.” ‘ \nWilson makes the point that Latin lacks a definite article, and that the verb used was not “pingere” (to paint) but “depingere” (to copy).  Thus the key phrase can be just as easily translated as: “… by an artist who had copied it … ”  which sheds rather a different light on the whole bizarre episode.  Thus relying on a questionable translation of a fraudulent memorandum may be the stuff by which art historians might make a living, but to others it may seem rather slender grounds for asserting that the origin of the Shroud image was ever an artist’s paint-brush! \nVery likely, D’Arcis’ alleged copy assuming it existed, may have been commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original she had taken from St Stephen’s at Besancon for safe-keeping and the venerable cleric was confused about the matter.  The 1880 assertion that both the Besancon and Piedmont Shrouds were authentic burial cloths beggars belief, would seem to be based on no more than an excessive piety, by 1880 the French Revolution would already have deposed of the Besancon icon, the reverend gentleman would no longer have had access to it, nor would he have had access to the 1898 Pia photography.\n\n","date":"November 26, 2014 at 4:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Free-thinkers!

It can boast as its ultimate logical outcome the Reign of Terror which followed the French Revolution, the founding of Freemasonry, and Free-thinkers dominated the French Academy of Science when Yves Delage attempted to present a scientific paper on the forensics of the Shroud of Turin. Having no objective criterion but one’s own subjective interpretation of what comprises adequate reason, it ultimately led to the totally subjective philosophy of Michel Foucault and others of his ilk.  These are they who would turn their backs on the Act of Providence that bestowed a Church which is heir to Christ’s guarantee of the charism of a divine authority.

He seems to favour the idea that leeches were used to paint the blood stains.  The main source for the claim seems to be the work of Heller & Adler (1981) that Kelly Kearse mentions in a recent posting.  The Shroud com “Facts 3” page also cites Schwalbe & Brillante as sources, but I had not been entirely successful in tracing their work.  I suspect it all comes back to Heller & Adler. \nSvensson & Heimburger also refer to the H&A 1981 paper, including the following comment: “From a forensic point of view, we must notice that this article has been published in a peer-reviewed journal (Canadian Society of Forensic Sciences Journal) dedicated to Forensic Science.”  They then list seven results which they deem the most important.  They give the following entry on item 7:\n” ‘Protease tests, leaving no residues’. This is very important: “Within a half hour this solution completely “dissolved” the non-birefringent red particulate coated fibrils coating, leaving no particulate residues… This protease treatment also removes the golden yellow fibrils, corroborating their identification as “serum” coated fibrils. Interestingly, fibrils freed of their coating using this technique closely resemble the non-image fibrils when viewed under phase-contrast…”   I take it that here they are quoting an H&A finding, and, unless I’m mistaking the intent, it seems to me that here is the main source for the assertion that there is no image under the blood stains.  \nAnother aspect raised by CB was the very low potassium levels, which he claimed also suit his leech theory.  Low potassium levels, are yet another by-product of physical trauma as explained in this paper. \nI was surprised to see how recently this S&H paper had been published (30 July), and it seemed to cover a lot of new material fairly definitively.

I think it is thoughtful and well-written.  However, let us not forget that Colin’s web-site seems to be agenda driven, with its heading “The Turin Shroud: but for the pseudo-science it might have been dismissed long ago as a medieval fake”  Contrast this with the more circumspect heading on Dan’s site intro –  “Is the Shroud real? Probably.”   Colin would win more friends if he was less provocative as to his intentions, and could demonstrate a modicum of open-mindedness about even the possibility of authenticity.  However I particularly like the point he makes about “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns” – for I suspect there are many such.  In the meantime “Peace!” and let us hope that it is more than just a “Cease-fire!”  \nI have been attempting to give some thought about the question of “pareidolia” as to their real presence or not, and what objective ways there might be of ascertaining this, or at least a better indication than mere subjectivity.  There has already been extensive comment following the posting of the recent paper on this topic.  One of the shortcomings of that paper, and indeed a considerable volume of most other material on the web concerning image analysis and identification, is that they all seem to seek to make comparisons with known pre-existing imagery, such as for example the attempt to make comparisons with an alleged back-of-cloth facial image with the known front-of-cloth image.  This approach clearly has limitations, and does not allow for the discovery of anything new not yet known, or at least possibly admissible.  \nA passing thought is the simple human ability to recognise ordinary alphabetic lettering despite a variety of fonts.  By objective measures only, there would seem little to connect say Lucida Black with Times Roman, serif fonts with non-serif, Gothic and Arial, etc.  Yet the human eye and brain readily succeed in achieving this recognition.  I think it doubtful that any objective measure could succeed in confirming this identification in the same degree.  OCR succeeds to some extent, but perhaps it needs to identify the font character set beforehand.  I suspect that similar comments may apply to pareidolia, that there are inherent difficulties with objective measurements.   \nThe frequency distribution of any variate is completely defined by its statistical moments, although it is rare to go higher than the fourth – 1st moment = central tendency (mean); 2nd moment = variability (standard deviation); 3rd moment = skewness; 4th moment = flatness or peakedness (kurtosis).  Higher moments tend to be unstable.  The situation becomes somewhat more complex for multi-variate distributions, and the grey-scale pixels on the Shroud cloth comprise degrees of greyness on a 2-dimensional matrix (surface of the cloth).  There is also the backgound inherent banding from the weave of the cloth. \nIt occurs to me that it should be possible to divide the cloth into a grid of squares wherein the various normalised moments can be ascertained.  There is a further complication with areas which may be blood-stained or not blood-stained, and whether the cell is an image area or non-image area.  Ideally it should be possible to ascertain grid moment outliers as areas of interest for further inquiry into pareidolia phenomena.  Yet a further complication is that pareidolia imply a geometrical shape, which again implies some kind of inter-connectedness between neighbouring pixels.  The computing requirements for such an investigation would be phenomenal, and perhaps it is no wonder that subjectivity has to date been the mainstay of attempts at identifying pareidolia – however such subjectivity has proved to be controversial and lacking agreement.  I think perhaps I have now exhausted my present thoughts on the topic, but possibly it may continue to tease my regrettably now senescent brain.  Perhaps a younger investigator may see something worthwhile in pursuing a few of these ideas.\n\n","date":"January 12, 2013 at 4:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/12/stop-taking-cudgels-to-each-other/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Stop taking cudgels to each other?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I would think that I would go further than some of the comments above.  In BT’s original comment for instance, I think that there can be a presumption that the technology available to any medieval forger, with all the properties that the TS is known to have, ought to be discernible to a competent technologist of the 21st century, if the TS had indeed been forged.  That no such technology can be so discerned, is for many a persuasive argument that forgery is at least a very unlikely.scenario.  Yannick Clement has often made the point that the bloodstains have been made before the image was formed, and that there is no image under the bloodstains   Furthermore the flow of the bloodstains conform with that of a crucufied man.  This has been discussed in considerable depth by a number of forensic specialists.  \nWe then would have to say that by some means your unknown forger was able to create an image which was a true negative, that the brightness of individual “pixels” encoded 3-D information, and so on, all that trouble just to produce a result  that on first inspection gives just a watery looking pale image that could only be truly discerned in the 20th century from photography, or VP8 analysis.  The word “symbol” is an understatement, and “mystery” is much closer to the mark.  \nMost of us are well past the point of claiming as BT alleges, that as the image cannot be explained, Shroudies claim that this is ” a convincing argument for authenticity”.  But together with all the other properties of the image, it still remains a powerful argument for authenticity.  \nThere are various naturalistic theories of how the image may have been formed, but none have been subjected to the crucible of rigorous testing.  Neither a naturalistic, nor artificial, nor even a miraculous means can yet be asserted, despite all the research that the TS has been subjected to.\n\n","date":"November 30, 2012 at 7:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/30/strong-ignorance-is-not-strong-evidence/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Strong ignorance is not strong evidence"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Mario’s comments above make a great deal more sense to me than those of the other correspondents here.

The Shroud was not “turned down in 1390 by Clement VII”, nor was it required to state that “it was not authentic.”  Permission was obtained to exhibit it on the understanding that the De Charnays should continue to describe it as a “likeness or representation”.  Rather than being prompted by the Bishop D’Arcis’ memo on the matter, Clement may well have suspected its true Constantinopolitan origins, and therefore adopted this requirement for reasons of discretion.  If Clement had any real reasons for suspecting a forgery because of the D’Arcis memo, he would not have twice ordered D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication, nor would he have permitted the exhibitions to continue.  His actions are more consistent with seeking to avoid an adverse reaction from either Rome or Constantinople. \nConcerning the Besancon Shroud:  It may well be the case that it was a planted substitute for the true Shroud, and its somewhat similarly vague presentation was an attempt at imitating some of its principal features.  Quite likely this was the actual cloth giving rise to D’Arcis complaint being mistakenly  misinformed as being painted, his error being to ascribe this to the Lirey Shroud.\n\n","date":"December 21, 2015 at 11:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Talk of “peasant stock” is so elitist, so yesterday, and so suggestive of the vestiges of an Indian caste system. \nMy own forbears were a motley lot: several master mariners, a professor of mathematics, a blacksmith, bush-fellers, a butcher or two, a jeweller, a rural mid-wife, members of the royal house of Orange-Nassau, a high-born Ngapuhi lady – daughter of a renown ariki in the north, a dress-maker, a hawker, and other assorted types.

There were early Jewish Christian conclaves there, even in apostolic times, and certainly Sts Peter and Paul were both there.  It did not require the presence of the imaged Shroud of Christ for a knowledge of his actual appearance, and it seems likely that many Jewish men were in fact bearded, and wore their hair long, which contrasted with the prevailing Greek and Roman fashions, clean shaven and cropped locks.  \nHowever there is at this time a variety of appearance in such iconography as there is, and this would seem to be an important point.  The iconography needs to make a connection with those to whom it is directed, and therefore an artistic and evangelizing imperative prevails, that the subject should not seem culturally alien.  \nA case study example:  The first Catholic missionaries to New Zealand were French Marists from Lyons to the Maori mission stations, soon followed by Irish clergy for the Catholic settlers, perhaps fleeing the Irish troubles, or the penal colonies in Australia.  Even in my boyhood, the statuary and holy pictures of Christ, the Holy Family and the various saints, inevitably reflected a European complexion, blue eyes and fair-skinned which I heard one priest describe as the “Iced-lolly” variety.  \nBut this is not the only kind that occurs.  Try this simple Google experiment:  search on “Maori Christ” and click on ‘Images’, and you will see the tattooed moko, the feathered cloaks, and the highly prized huia feather as hair adornment showing high-born status, together with the other cultural features, such as unshod feet.  Doubtless other cultural ‘icongraphy’ also occurs, whether it be Chinese, Korean, or Filipino.  \nThe earliest Shroud-like images of Christ appear to be the St Catherine’s Pantocrator, the Homs vase image, and the gold solidus of 692, all seemingly commissioned by Justinian II.  Following his defeats and eventual reinstatement, Justinian seems to have interpreted his earlier representations as a sign of divine wrath, and abandoned these earlier attempts at realism.  The iconoclastic movement also no doubt played a part. \nHowever the Image of Edessa also seems to have had a major influence in church iconography at this time, and there is an almost universal consistency in the portrayals claiming to be of Mandylion status.  \n I think it is extensive enough to demonstrate that indeed, a single image can and did in fact spark off an artistic revolution across a very wide area!\n\n","date":"December 25, 2015 at 4:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"‘ “The earliest Shroud-like images of Christ appear to be the St Catherine’s Pantocrator, the Homs vase image, and the gold solidus of 692, all seemingly commissioned by Justinian II”.\nAbsolutely not. ‘\nThank you for the pictures, David but I see rather more Shroud-like features in the three artefacts I mentioned, than merely long hair and a beard, and these features are not displayed in the pictures you have provided, interesting as they are.

The collapse was not caused by the weight of the train, but occurred during a violent storm, and failed because the lateral bracing was insufficient to withstand the wind loading from the storm.  \nI spent some 5 years on Railway bridge construction and another eight years in a Bridge Design Office early in my engineering career, so it’s something I was once expert in.

No, not really.  But there never has been, and I think never will be, another web-site to match Dan Porter’s shroudstory blog site.  But nothing stays the same, and everything changes.  So I suppose I can now attend to that long list of “things to be done” compiled by the other long-tolerant member of my household. \nIt has been a wonderful experience meeting you all on-line, even when our views were completely different.  The tragic loss for me is that I’m unlikely to meet you all again, except by happen-stance.  \nHere at the other end of the world, there seems to be little interest in the Shroud of Christ.  Even during the exposition earlier this year, there was scarcely a mention of it in the Catholic News media, and I note that even CathNews NZ has only a few token news items about it on its web-site.  I ought to have written something about it for them, but I didn’t.  I did run a few well-attended lectures about the Shroud for my U3A group,  Perhaps with the extra free time now available, I can develop that into something more. \nGod seems seldom to intrude into human affairs, but treats us all as free spirits.  This was the way that Dan Porter ran his blog, seldom intruding, no heavy-handed moderating, nor imposing his own particular perspective, but leaving us free to exchange our views, no matter how well or how badly informed we might have been.  There was always someone else only too ready to correct us, contradict or lampoon even, no matter that they themselves were right or wrong. \nAs a child, I recall my Nana had a small icon of the Shroud facial image, and sometimes I came across the occasional popular magazine article.  My first real education on the Shroud began in 1960 with a presentation, likely based on Barbet’s work and given by our University Dominican chaplain,to a roomful of sceptical engineering students, but it impressed a few of us at the time.  Much of the content has since been debated on this site, and will now persist in being argued elsewhere.  I purchased Ian Wilson’s 1970 book, and learnt a great deal more about it.  \nI found Dan’s site I think in 2011, and convinced by Wilson that the Shroud was the Mandylion, blogged accordingly.  My views have since changed and I now think it was something else, perhaps the Image of Camuliana, the Image of God Incarnate.  The pollen debate has been disconcerting but still an adequate argument.  \nI continue to be persuaded that the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth.  No-one in medieval times had the anatomical knowledge to persuade 20th century pathologists that it was nothing else, perfection of Greek statuary notwithstanding, and the historic clues prior to Lirey are adequate or at least suggestive.  The Jerusalem aragonite limestone on the feet is persuasive, and the image is a close match with the gospel accounts of the crucifixion.   \nThe cause of the Image continues to be enigmatic, but I suspect not necessarily a divine mystery.  It took Colin Berry some four years of experimenting before he persuaded himself that he might have found some kind of an answer, but if it was a medieval artisan, then we don’t know who it was, and he left no trace of what must have been several failures before he struck gold.  And he never ever did it again.  \nSome thoughts on professionals and amateurs.  The patriarch Abraham began as a herdsman, Jesus as some kind of woodworker;  the followers he chose were ordinary common folk, fishermen mainly, and Paul was a tent-maker, hardly prepossessing material for a major religious movement which now pervades the globe.  \nThe mathematics of Pythagoras remain as true as they ever were.  But in the other sciences, what was heresy yesterday is tomorrow’s dogma, and what was dogma is now heresy.  Similarly history, always written by pro tem victors, is persistently rewritten.  The Renaissance men knew nothing of such specialisation but sought an all-round general education and comprehensive world-experience, and it is they I have sought to emulate. \nI shall miss you all.  Thank you so much for being a significant part of my life.  I shall turn 77 this Christmas, with some aches and pains and hearing loss, but some adequate mental faculties still mercifully remain.

He struggled with alcoholism for much of his life, converted to Catholicism, had a profoundly spiritual awareness, and wrote not only some hard-nosed poetry, plays and other works, but also regular columns for the Catholic newspapers.

Much of his poetry has a raw edge to it, reflects human situations, whereas Thompson’s poetic genius seems more concerned with the divine.\n\n","date":"August 18, 2013 at 4:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/17/the-barefoot-man-it-is-christs-shroud-not-turins/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Barefoot Man: It is Christ’s Shroud not Turin’s"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Prof Fanti Quote: “…  and I tend to suppose authentic also the Oviedo Sudario, the Tunique of Argenteiul and the Titulus Crucis (being the first more reliable for me than the last) from knowledge I have on these Objects …” \nThe Titulus Crucis certainly existed, was said to have been discovered by St Helena in 325 AD, and was attested by pilgrim Egeria in 383 AD, and by other later notables.

We might ask whether Mark made any notes soon afterwards of what he heard from Peter, whether these were transcribed in Aramaic or Greek, and whether they were later incorporated into a complete gospel.

I would agree that these would most likely arrive at a standard fixed form.  Peoples of this era and even indigenous people today had and have specialists with remarkable recall of oral transmission. I see it here in NZ with both Samoan and Maori who can recite very long genealogies entirely from memory handed down from their forbears. It’s also evident in their knowledge of astronomy for navigation. [Recall Alex Haley’s “Roots” and his encounters with African peoples] These oral traditions (particularly Matthew’s) would have been recited as part of liturgies.  The Parousia was soon expected and there would be little point in setting them down in writing until it became apparent that eye-witnesses were dying out, and the Parousia was not as immediate as they had imagined. I could agree that there may well have been a few written sources which were available for the evangelists to draw on. \n2) The argument from Luke’s Acts, I believe will not stand up. There is too much discrepancy between Paul’s own teachings in his epistles and Luke’s interpretation, for Acts to be contemporaneous with Paul. There is no need for Acts to record the death of Paul, and this is a flimsy argument to assert that Acts predates it. \n3) If Papias has Mark as Peter’s amenuensis, why does he then say that Mark wrote as he remembered, but not in the right order, as if Peter was not then available to correct any errors that Papias believed Mark had got incorrect? And clearly Matthw and Luke both draw on Mark’s final gospel (95% of mark in Matthew). \n4) Concerning the prophecy of the temple’s destruction, one could brutally say that these are words that Matthew and Luke put into Jesus’ mouth, after the event. It is not included in Mark 13, in the discourse on the end-time. However, with the political situation in Jerusalem from about 65AD, any astute observer would likely have had little diificulty in foreseeing the destruction of the temple together with the associated Roman suppression. \n5) I see the final redactors of the gospels, particlarly Matthew and Luke, not so much as original authors, but more as editors each with a specific purpose, who assembled a mix of oral traditions and written material, set their own particular viewpoint upon this material, before the gospels attained their final form. The pericope form so prevalent throughout their gospels is the clue that this was the process they followed.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2013 at 6:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"O.K: The relic was hidden in 455 to protect it during the Visigoth attack, but it seems that its hiding place was known to a few. Antoninus in the 6th century reports seeing a titulus in Jerusalem (see below). Wiki states that sometime before 1145 the present relic was placed in a box which has the seal of a cardinal who became Pope in 1144 (which would seem to be Pope Lucius II). So it seems that the present artifact dates at least from this time. I would think that Helena was well enough endowed with crucifixion relics, to have insufficent motive to arrange a forgery of any other. I should also think that both Helena and Lucius would be suffiently versed in Greek and Latin, not to reverse the lettering. Thiede argues that the lettering may have been done by a Jewish scribe (hence the reversed lettering) and the order of Hebrew, Greek and Latin, matches what is historically plausible, whereas a forger would have adhered to what is in the NT canon [John = Hebrew, Latin, Greek]. Joe Nickell is known to dismiss this argument as second-guessing, as forgers commonly do the unexpected. I’m not sure why you argue that the 1st century scripts were unknown in 1000 AD. If the original had badly deteriorated during the first millenium, then Lucius or someone else may have thought to create a replica from what then remained. \nThe report of Antoninus differs from the present text. ‘The 6th century pilgrim Antoninus from Piacenza describes a Titulus in Jerusalem and its inscription: it said “Hic est rex Iudeaorum” (Here is the king of the Jews), while the one kept in Rome shows “Iesus Nazarenvs Rex Iudeaorum” (Jesus the Nazarene king of the Jews)’. Either Antoninus is relying on a faulty memory when he writes this, or it is some other titulus.  \nThe carobon dating was apparently reported in the peer-reviewed journal “Radiocarbon” – Francesco Bella; Carlo Azzi (2002). “14C Dating of the Titulus Crucis”.

The letter was rediscovered in the archive of the Abbey of St. Caterina a Formiello, Naples; it is folio CXXVI of the Chartularium Culisanense, originating in 1290, a copy of which came to Naples presumably as a result of close political ties with the imperial Angelus-Comnenus family from 1481 on.

Polemis concedes, with Stiernon, only that after Theodore’s fall from power did his contemporaries call him by Angelos. See Wolfe (240). The use of the name Angelos and the credibility of Theodore’s letter in 1205 are supported by the following. In 1202, when the Western princes launched the Fourth Crusade from Venice, Alexius IV, the son of the deposed Isaac II, appealed to the crusaders, promising to end the schism of East and West, to pay for their transport, and to provide military support to the crusaders against their original target, Egypt, if they helped him to depose his uncle and to sit on his father’s\nthrone.

The absence of smears on the cloth make it unlikely that it was used as a body bag, and also that there was a minimum of handling of the body.   \nBarbet is specific on the cause of the blood belt on the back.  \nCrucifixion was carried out with the victim made to lie on the ground, his arms possibly temporarily bound to the cross-beam, while the hands / wrists were nailed to it.  The execution squad would then lift the cross-beam onto the top of the upright, and probably tacking it to stop it from tipping.  The feet were then nailed to the upright, Barbet claims by a single nail.  \nAfter he had expired, it was then a simple matter to remove the nail from the feet and then to lift the cross-beam off the upright.  Rigor mortis would have set in, and the body would have been quite rigid and would not sag if it was carried horizontally.  Barbet claims that it was not until they had reached the tomb that the body was placed on the Shroud, as otherwise it would have been drenched with the blood from the interior vena cava.  He is quite detailed on this point, mentioning discussions he had with officials from a local abattoir who were familiar with this particular blood flow.  \nDuring the journey the greater part of the blood was either lost or collected.  Only that remained which coagulated on the skin.  He maintains that the rear part of the right heel is poorly marked compared to the sole, and that this was the only part of the body that was handled.  He postulates that a band or a twisted sheet was used to support the thorax, and that this is the cause of the blood belt.  The flow has congealed transversally on the back, has even managed partly to reascend, and consists of irregular windings, which bifurcate and come together again several times.  The band would have become saturated with blood, but only a small part of it shows on the skin as the blood belt from the folds within the twisted sheet. \nWith the minimum of handling so evident, he considers that the cross-beam was used to support the top half of the body and it was not removed until they reached the tomb, which was nearby.  In Barbet’s detailed scenario there is no need for a stretcher or body bag, and it seems that the distance that the body was carried was not far.    \nJohn 19:40-42:  “40 They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. 41 Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried. 42 So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by.”\nNote:  ‘a garden in the place where he had been crucified;  in the garden a new tomb;  the tomb was close by’.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2014 at 5:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Shroud of Turin was never a body bag.

It also referred to a window in a Swiss church showing the Besancon Shroud, with Besancon clergy and the shroud shown there is claimed to be a virtual copy of the Turin Shroud with the double image.  Clearly differences of viewpoints will always appear on the web expressed in different ways, and they’re not always accurate.  However the general consensus of opinion I’ve found is that although the original Shroud from Constantinople was sent to Besancon from Athens, it was in the possession of the Charnay-Vergy family when St Stephen’s was destroyed by fire.  A cloth claiming to be the true Shroud was later displayed at Besancon in the new church.  I did not pursue whether the Swiss illustration was of the original or its supposed replacement, but the church window was I think 15th century, well after 1355.  But I think there are other illustrations of it.  Possibly these only display a ventral image.  The inference to be made is that Jeanne de Vergy provided a substitute copy she had commissioned to replace the original one held at Besancon.

In any event, a shroud of some type was on display at the Chapel of the Holy Shroud in Saint-Etienne (Besançon), which building also possessed one of St. Stephen’s arms (before the fire of 1349). In due course, the painted shroud was placed in the newly upgraded Cathedral of Saint John (1669). It had become an important object of veneration in the seventeenth century, a period of conflict (Thirty Years War, annexations and withdrawals of France from this region) and yet another round of the plague. Indeed, the surrender of the city in front of the French armed forces, in 1674, was conditioned only upon a requirement to keep this relic at the Cathédrale Saint-Jean de Besançon.

Bergeret and Piana have provided photos of a wooden chest labeled in recent times as that in which the Shroud was “brought back by Othon de Ray in 1206.”  Scavone opts for the 1219 date. \n– At some time before 1349, Jeanne de Vergy, concerned that at Besancon the Shroud was under threat from various causes, decides to rescue the Shroud for France, and brought to her marriage to Geoffray I de Charnay 1351-54.  Malijay argued further that she presented it first to the French king, Philip VI de Valois (d. 1351), who in turn awarded it to Geoffroy de\nCharny. \n– Besançon’s historians wrote that on March 6, 1349, a fire in St. Stephen Cathedral resulted in the apparent destruction–certainly, the disappearance– of their Shroud and the loss of all church documents attesting to the circumstances of its arrival in that city.  It would have been unwise to announce that Lirey now possessed Besançon’s lost precious relic.\n– In 1624 J. J. Chifflet, Besançon’s first historian, convinced that the original Shroud was consumed in the St. Stephen fire, wrote that in 1377 it was miraculously discovered in a niche in the new cathedral. In 1902, based on the illustrations of the Lirey and Besançon shrouds from Chifflet’s book,  Vignon wrote that the Shroud of Besançon was clearly a replica of that of Lirey, made between the years 1349 (the fire) and 1375. Besançon’s own historian Dom François Chamard (1902) agreed–though he was not forthcoming about how Lirey had obtained the original.  \n– Towards the conclusion of his paper, Scavone makes the case that the copy was commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the Shroud she had taken from Besancon, that the succession of four bishops meant that no-one really knew what the original Besancon Shroud looked like, that the copy was attested by a bishop who was a family connection, and that this was the actual copy referred to in Pierre D’Arcis’ notes, and that D’Arci’s was confused as to which was the genuine Shroud.  \nIt all hangs together very neatly, and my summary notes barely do full justice to Scavone’s detailed case.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2014 at 6:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"While I can applaud Colin’s rigour in exploring all possible avenues of enquiry, I don’t think I can buy into his body bag argument.  \nAt the cross, the arms would have been set fixed in the outstretched position of crucifixion by rigor mortis.  The image of course shows the arms brought down to the sides with the hands carefully crossed covering the pubis.  The question arises as to when the burial party forced the arms into this position, which probably took some effort to do. \nIt was Barbet’s opinion that the taking down from the cross and the transport to the tomb was accomplished simply by a party not needing more than five men who merely removed the cross-beam from the upright, two carrying the cross-beam with the arms still attached, two supporting the trunk, and one at the feet.  There may have been a cloth casually wrapped around the body to catch any blood for its inclusion with the burial.  At the tomb, the arms would have been removed from the cross beam and brought into their final position for the burial.  \nA particular problem with the image I’ve often noticed and mentioned, is that it is a near orthogonal projection like a photograph, and it is difficult to imagine how this could have come about.  This does not seem to me like a body bag image which ought to show the sides and the top of the head, and would also show a more distorted randomised image, if that was the case.  I’ve sometimes wondered if some of the 100 lb package that Nicodemus brought was used to pack the sides of the body, which would go some way to explaining orthogonality. \nDespite the assertions made that the Besancon Shroud was also an authentic burial cloth, I think that this is a misapprehension made merely to assert its validity, and that it is more likely to have been a painted copy commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy in her efforts to placate the Besancon authorities that the Shroud she had taken for safe-keeping had been restored to them.  That her stratagem worked is attested by the spurious claims made for her substitution.  It would seem that Bishop D’Arcis believed in the existence of a painted copy, but was confused as to which cloth was the copy.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2014 at 1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Andrea is free to believe what he will.  He may prefer the  alleged explanation of Pierre D’Arcis that it was so cunningly painted that it succeeded in deceiving a succession of medical forensic pathologists from Yves Delage to Fredererik Zugibe.  That will not satisfy others more rationally minded.  Scavone makes the point as early as his page 3 that the Shroud remains relatively free of historical documentation.  I should imagine that the 1349 fire at St Stephen’s would leave little in the way of any documentation of any real event there whatsoever.  What little might have remained in the region was dispatched by the French Revolution.  In those circumstances it is fatuous to demand documentation to make a case for anything, and one must be satisfied with what little can be discovered, some even from family traditions.  Geoffray de Charnay’s descendants could only say that his acquiring  the Shroud was as “a reward freely given” which assists very little.  If the Shroud was not “cunningly painted” then its emergence in Lirey by some means demands an explanation.  We can hardly suppose that Othon de la Roche had any motive for sending it to either of the De Charnay or de Vergy families in Troyes, when his own castle was at Besancon in Burgundy. \nThe “historical critical” method which Andrea seems to consider is the touchstone of historic discipline puts me much in mind of Bertrand Russell’s approach to mathematics with his logical positivism.  Russell devoted some 300 pages of his Mathematica to prove his conjecture that if one object was added to yet one other object of the same class, that the result was in fact two such objects.  I exaggerate not!  Russell’s Mathematica is now merely of antiquarian interest, and it discovered little that was new.  I fear that the “historical critical” method is of the same genre, and it is hardly likely to discover anything that is not already known.

Because they were dominated by so-called free-thinkers and so-called rationalists. The British have seldom shown an interest in Shroud investigations, apart from their involvement in the notorious Carbon-14 dating tests, and they fluffed it.  They were even talked out of a rigorous sampling protocol.  Dr Berry’s assertions that there is no evidence of crucifixion in the subject of the image, pretends an ignorance in the 1930s work of forensic pathologist Dr Pierre Barbet, and so Dr Berry has fluffed it.  McCrone’s otherwise highly reputable laboratory came to false conclusions and so he has fluffed it. Madame Flury-Lemburg a most highly recognised textile specialist, claimed that the material of the cloth was uniform, and so she fluffed it.

If Andrea Nicolotti or David Mo had lived in the Pacific or in Africa they might have a rather different view of the worth and value and authenticity of oral tradition of non-literate peoples, the prevailing milieu of 14th century Europe.  Setting aside the plagiarism controversy, I would recommend as a first lesson the reading of Alex Haley’s “Roots The Saga of an American Family”.   It seems that Haley borrowed extensively from Harold Courlander’s “The African”.  Nevertheless “Roots” had great influence on awareness in the United States of African-American history and inspired a broad interest in genealogy and family history.  \nMuch of its success derived from the oral traditions in Africa which were found to match the Afro-American traditions that Haley had come to know through his own family in the USA.   Likewise the Polynesians navigated the Pacific by means of the oral traditions handed down to them.  In NZ today the Maori folk recall their genealogies with great reliability, together with the various historic events significant to them.  The scriptures themselves are derived from oral traditions, the alleged contradictions between the four gospels for instance are generally of insignificant import, and their consistency is remarkable.     \nTo demand a non-existent documentation of a 14th century non-literate society, in the wake of massive destructions of such evidence from a persistent war-torn environment, is I think to rob Europe of much of the tradition of its own significant historical events.   \nYes, Russell’s “Principia Mathematica” was a massive and significant work.  However few mathematicians today have even bothered to read it.  It seems that the Russell-Whitehead vision of building a mathematical edifice solely on principles of logic was dealt its death blow by Godel’s 1931 theorem of undecideability.  “Moreover, Kurt Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem (1931) proves that there cannot be a single logical theory from which the whole of mathematics is derivable: all consistent theories of arithmetic are necessarily incomplete.”  Nevertheless, scientists, engineers and even mathematicians continue to do mathematics and see it as a worthwhile and valuable activity!  \nI suspect that the much vaunted “Historical Critical” approach to the discipline of History is in similar vein to Russell’s essentially Platonic view of mathematics, and no less likely in its inability to discover anything new of great moment!\n\n","date":"November 30, 2014 at 5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Dr Berry attacks the members of STURP, and asserts that the matter would be better handled by an institution.

That morning, my daily newspaper had published a fascinating item on the latest news about Rosetta / Philae / CP7.  The contrast between the scientific approach taken on these two disparate topics seemed so comedic to me, that it prompted my comments in reply to Louis which Dan promoted in the lead posting above.  \nScientific interest in the Shroud commenced in 1898, with the first photographs taken, and probably the greatest achievement occurred with the mainly American STURP investigations of 1978.  Their success and advanced technology seemed to have left the locals somewhat mortified and humiliated, and STURP was shut out of the 1988 radiocarbon investigations.  There seem to be other signs of reluctance to involve the wider scientific community, such as the non-release of a series of detailed micrographs taken which could reveal further information.

All this seems to some professionals to be a little bizarre. \nThe disciplined approach with generous funding taken by the wider European scientific community to investigate a lump of rock 308 million km from Earth, is in sharp contrast to the lack of any systematic investigation of a holy relic which is of considerable public interest, but which languishes for want of a similarly coordinated approach, and at an insignificant small fraction of the cost of Rosetta.\n\n","date":"June 18, 2015 at 6:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/17/the-masters-of-comedy-in-piedmont/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Masters of Comedy in Piedmont"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Granted that the quest for candidates for canonisation is a significant agenda item for Rome, as seemed particularly the case for JP II, the demands of papacy as CEO require that no single issue become an isolated focus to the exclusion of other significant priorities.

Everyone’s life experience and world view has value, and is valid to them.  What is not permissible is to assert dogmatically that the Shroud is not the authentic burial cloth of Christ, nor to assert dogmatically that indeed it is.  It is conceivable that the Shroud is what it appears to be, and equally conceivable that it may not be.  My own personal opinion based on the information which I have considered over a long life, that it is the burial cloth is well enough known.  That opinion as is the opinion of others are all worthy of respect if honestly derived.  \nBecause the Shroud may be what it appears to be, it ought to be approached with the proper reverence and respect that admits such a possibility.  It cannot be dismissed as an insignificant rag, or merely a cunning device created for the gullible and superstitious, regardless of whatever our personal opinion may be of it.  Too much about it is unknown. \nIn Andrea’s posted comment above, reasons are given for his rejecting its authenticity.  Andrea has written a book arguing that the Shroud is not the Mandylion, and therefore he would seem to have a vested interest in asserting that it is not authentic.  Quite likely he may be correct in his assertion that it is not the Mandylion, but that is quite insufficient by itself to assert non-authenticism, as there are any number of other possibilities, some of them unknown.  Wilson’s Mandylion theory was only one such brave attempt to derive an explanation for the apparent gap in its history.  Andrea, along with others, considers it has failed to do so. \nHe asserts that for thirteen centuries no-one in history has ever spoken of the Shroud.  That is his own peculiar rigorous view of history, where he seems to require a specific document outlining and specifying all the features of the Shroud that we now know.   A more open approach to history would place some value on the very many less specific and obscure references that we find in Byzantine sources, but to an open mind would seem plain enough, particularly if allowance is made for a typical Byzantine obscurantism when discussing matters of the Holy.  It is therefore incorrect to assert that no mention is made. \nHe then refers to the comments of the Bishop of Troyes and the Pope, presumably Pierre D’Arcis, and Avignon Pope Clement VII.  Much of what is asserted here derives from the work of Chevalier and Thurston, both of whom had a peculiar agenda of asserting non-authenticity in response to the photography of Secondo Pia and the forensic work of Delage and Vignon.  Both Chevalier and Thurston have been charged with a conspiracy to misrepresent their sources.  A rigorous approach to history should be satisfied that the claims that D-Arcis and Clement VII are asserted to have made are indeed factual, and are without the bias of Chevalier and Thurston.   \nHe then ventures beyond his own field of specialised competence into the forensic.  He dogmatically asserts that the image could not have been produced by a dead body without the intervention of a craftsman, and that the blood flows are unrealistic.  Given the particular properties of the Shroud cloth, he cannot know this, and several forensic pathologists, experienced in such matters, have asserted otherwise.  Nor does his assertion that the Shroud cloth is technologically medieval stand unchallenged.  There are good reasons for asserting that the yarn was processed according to ancient methods, particularly the bleaching process.  \nHis brave attempt at asserting that twelve separate radiocarbon tests dated the cloth to medieval times, conveniently passes over the fact that all the tests were carried out on one single unrepresentative sample, so that it would be incomprehensible and incompetent of the laboratories if the results did not match.  In fact the actual tests are known to have failed a chi square test for consistency, so even that remains an unresolved issue.  \nI am uncertain as to his intent in mentioning coins, but it is curious that there are Byzantine solidi from about the sixth century which are a close match to the Shroud facial image.  Perhaps his allusion is to the debatable coins over they eyes issue.  He seems to dismiss such matters as pollens, although there remains sufficient evidence from spring pollens exclusive to Jerusalem environs, including the Dead Sea area.  \nHe omits any reference to the presence of Jerusalem aragonite limestone found on the feet, nose and knees of the image, as if from a fall, and from walking the Via Dolorosa.  \nPerhaps none of the matters I have mentioned are sufficient by themselves to assert authenticity, but taken together I find them a powerful argument.  There still remains the enigmatic image of a man of sorrows.  And yet with all our modern technology, no-one yet knows how that image was created.  The Shroud may indeed yet prove to be the burial cloth of Christ, notwithstanding the naysayers.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2015 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The National Geographic article on the new archaeological site in Turkey is somewhat ambiguous on the age of the complex, except to say that it is thought to date from earliest Byzantine times.  It may have been too late for any significant Christian relics to be deposited there.  \nIt is Markwardt’s theory that Bishop Ephraemius took an important icon from Antioch to Cappadocia in 540 AD to preserve it from the attack by Persian Chosroes.  He argues that it was the Shroud.  The Image of Camuliana was paraded around Cappadocia and Anatolia in 554.  In 574, Byzantine emperor Justin II brought two important relics to Constantinople, a relic of the True Cross, and an image of Jesus which was said to have originated in Camuliana.

Later Heron of Alexandria constructed similar orreries. \nThe “antikythera” (so named from its location) was discovered in the Aegean in 1900 by Greek sponge divers and lying in 200 ft of water.  In 1958 Derek Price was permitted to examine its remains.  It is essentially an astronomical clock, with an inscription giving instructions, It included mechanical gearing, and a dial with signs of the zodiac.  It included a slip ring which could be used to adjust the mechanism, as predating Julius Caesar’s leap year calendar, the constellations would gradually get out of sync with the lunar calendar then in use.  \nIt included several gear trains, and signs of minor repairs indicated that the device actually worked and was in use.  From the setting of the slip ring it seems that the ship sank about 65 BCE, but then little further was heard of such devices, until about 1000 AD, when al-Biruni an Iranian savant traveled to India and described a very similar machine.

Geoffray de Charnay  had indeed subjected himself to a similar earlier period of voluntary English imprisonment, as you indicate above had John II.  Wilson is at pains to cover De Charnay’s fascination with the ideals of knightly chivalry, and of course mentions his earlier namesake, the Templar Prior of Normandy executed with Jacques de Molay.  The inference seems to be that De Charnay was attempting to found a successor order similar to the Templars.  \nThe Lirey badge of course shows the De Charnay arms on the dexter side of the shield implying that De Charnay was still alive when the badge was struck to commemorate the first showings at Lirey, so that it had to be before 1356.  Part of Wilson’s purpose in mentioning this fascination with knightly ideals seems to be to exempt him from any deliberate fraud in creating the Shroud, as out of character for such a person.  The Shroud image itself is quite unlike any concurrent artistic model of a dead Christ.  Whether De Charnay had the financial or technological resources, let alone the time available to him in what seems to have been a busy warrior’s life seems an unlikely proposition.  \nYou’ve spent some three years experimenting in your attempts to produce something even vaguely like the image.

In general, analytic solutions are usually only available for the simplest cases, such as in laminar flow of incompressible fluids, particularly if they can be modeled in two dimensions only.  \nA lot is known about the turbulent phases and the significance of boundary layers, momentum exchanges and so on, but knowledge and analysis remains imperfect, theoretical only, and to some extent speculative.  In most practical cases of any complexity it is necessary to resort to physical modelling.  Some skill and knowledge is required to ensure that the requirements of dimensional analysis are satisfied, and it is usually not enough to construct merely a geometrical model.  Depending on what phenomena are thought to be most significant the model must be consistent with several various dimensionless numbers, such as the Reynold’s No., Mach No., and so on.  \nThe situation becomes more complex in the case of compressible flow, more so if random temperatures occur such as in a fire. \nThe “Trench Effect” mentioned by Max would seem to be some kind of convection phenomenon caused by the fire, possibly due to some kind of confined air flow from the temperature gradients.  In different practical situations, other as yet unknown effects might also occur, and can usually only be identified by physical modelling.  \nI would think it unlikely that the “Trench Effect” per se would be of direct relevance in creating the Shroud image.  As yet we do not know the processes that might have been involved in creating the image, assuming that it might be naturalistic.  However if fluid flow was involved in its creation, then a physical model would in time be necessary to test any hypothesis, and some as yet unknown fluid phenomenon might yet be involved.  Concerning collimation, it was for this reason that I had wondered whether earthquake stimulated radon emissions might be relevant, in confining and directing whatever particulates might have caused the image.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2015 at 3:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I think there are several problems, no matter how John 20:8 might be interpreted.  If even St Augustine & St John Chrysostom had different views on the matter, I can’t see how one view can prevail over the other.  To follow Augustine’s view could be to fall into the trap of religious reductionism.  Although Augustine could have been right. \nWhat cloths did Peter & John see?  Why did Mary Magdala mistake Jesus for the gardener?  If he was clothed in the Shroud as a himation as Max contends, then the cloths they saw could not have been the Shroud.  They could only have been the bandages and ties.  The head cloth in a separate place had probably been removed by Nicodemus and Joseph A.  To put a supernatural interpretation on it, it may be that Mary saw Jesus draped in some kind of miraculous or heavenly garment, but then he says he has not yet ascended to the Father!  Then it could be that the cloth they saw was in fact the Shroud.  Meacham’s paper refers to the glutinous properties of the myrrh, and then Peter & John have to get their heads around the idea that a grave robbery has occurred, that only the body has been taken away after the difficult matter of removing it from the glutinous coated Shroud.  Alternatively if they saw the image had formed on the Shroud, this might persuade them to believe in the Resurrection.  But only if the image had already been formed, and had been fixed.

There’s plenty to think about there. \nThere would seem to be definite limits to how far the rigour of the scientific method can take us.  As John Klotz correctly asserts we cannot order our lives by this method.  Decisions must be made, and we do so in normal life by a collection of probabilities.  Sometimes we are right in our assessment, and we therefore succeed. But sometimes we are wrong. That’s just a fact of ordinary life. Yet most of the time, we can still pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and start all over again. \nAn obvious limit to the scientific method is that there are no certain agreed proofs for authenticity, but plenty available for testing non-authenticity. But when most of the available proofs for non-authenticity have been exhausted and have failed, this only notches up an increased likelihood for authenticity, but can never make it certain. \nAnother apparent limit of the scientific method, is conflicting interpretation of evidence. We see this in court rooms everyday, where opposite sides are quite capable of calling expert witnesses to the stand to bolster their case. Where they conflict, both cannot possibly be right. At this stage it is the jury’s prerogative to call the verdict, again based on probability.  \nIn the case of the Shroud, the scientists have been hamstrung by lack of access.  And so science has been so far unable to have its last word on the matter, even though it may well already have the methods to carry out definitive tests, one way or the other.  \nThere still remains plenty of scope for experimentation without the need for direct access. There have been attempts to replicate the image, but so far these have only been rudimentary. The search for a naturalistic explanation of how a dead body might form an image on a piece of ancient linen has hardly been explored at all.

Both originate from primal religious rituals but are seen to survive even in mature religious rituals and even every day social rituals.  A topical example of a contagious ritual would be the pressing of a copy of the Shroud to the original with the intention that the mystique or power of the original would be imparted onto the copy.  An example of imitative magic would be the creation of a doll, with recognisable features, perhaps using the hair of the intended victim, to do harm to an enemy.  Imitative magic survives in some forms of emblems. It was widely used in medieval medicine by prescribing foods that had the appearance of the affected organ, e.g. walnuts for brain fever.  The sign of the cross for instance might be technically classified as such by imitating the form of the cross. \nA kiss might by a principle of contagious magic provide adequate defence against the power of the magician, or conversely inhibit the power of the magician.  This explanation has been grossly simplified, merely to explain the basic principles involved.  However once explained, several examples can come readily to mind, e.g. the finger of God reaching out to the finger of Adam in the Sistine Chapel Creation scene. \nTouch is a fundamental principle in the Polynesian and Maori concepts of “tapu”.  The head is particularly tapu.  In the old days, Maori chiefs had sometimes to be fed by their womenfolk, as food is “noa” or common, and the chief might be in a state of tapu, and could not touch the food himself. Attendance at a Maori funeral makes one tapu, and so requires the eating of food at its conclusion to return everyone to a state of “noa”.\n\n","date":"March 14, 2013 at 8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/13/the-shroud-connection-shape-shifting-jesus-described-in-ancient-egyptian-text/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud Connection: Shape-Shifting Jesus Described in Ancient Egyptian Text"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If all the philosophers were laid end to end, then like economists, they still would never reach a common conclusion!\n\n","date":"March 31, 2014 at 6:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/31/the-shroud-that-defies-scientific-explanation/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud that Defies Scientific Explanation?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I’m not at all sure about that.

As a side-issue on perception:- The rural aborigines in outback Australia are renown for their remarkable tracking abilities. In an otherwise barren landscape they are capable of perceiving the minutest traces of the path of an animal or fugitive over the course of several days.

Clearly there are realities, invisible to some but visible to only a few, while others will make something of a perceived pattern which has no real significance.

She seems to have successfully produced 3-D image of a key and a snake. Some have commented that they are the most successful images produced to date; others have commented that they are only of relatively thin objects. Her paper “Shroud-like image formation during seismic activity” by Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010, may be found at http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf and is well worth reading. Note that the PDF is ‘secured’ so I’m unable to copy and paste extracts here.\nThe most successful images were produced in connection with the seismic release of radon gas in the neighbourhood of iron-bearing gneiss rock formations, with electrostatic discharges and infra-sound emission and with variations in the local geomagnetic field. It seems that the lack of any one of these variables resulted in no image. \nI have been unable to find out very much about this author, and she has not responded to my enquiries in English. I am given to understand that she may work with Prof Giulio Fanti, and has supported his “corona discharge” hypothesis, so some consider she may be suspect. My own view is that the paper should stand on its own merits. Twelve years of dedicated work resulting in the successful production of 3-D images is not to be ignored.\nRadon-222 is the longest-lived isotope of radon with a half-life of 3.28 days, emitting alpha particles, and is a decay product of radium. It is prepared synthetically for treatment of cancer, as the daughter product is Bismuth-214 which produces penetrating gamma radiation. In an earthquake the quantities would be very small. However Radon-222 has been implicated as the most significant non-tobacco cause of lung cancer in apartment dwellings in USA. \nI recall that there have been subsequent papers citing De Liso’s work which you may find on the shroud.com site. The collimation hypothesis is something that requires further investigation, and we shall have to wait for any further information which may possibly come to light in due course.

I have not heard it referred to as “Partial Least Squares” before, and I have not heard of this as a form of analysis distinct from “Least Squares”.  I might guess that it could get its name from taking the Partial Derivatives of the Least Square equations on each of the multiple variables to obtain the coefficients  and equating the various partial derivatives to zero to minimise the various least square sums.  \nIf you are familiar with ordinary multivariate regression analysis, I’d be inclined to use that, if not, then consult any standard text on Statistics and Probability theory, most of which will include a chapter on MVR.  \nVery tersely:  Let there be n sets of data points in k independent variables x(j) where the x(j) are measured about their sample mean values.  Then the objective is to obtain an estimate y’ of the dependent variable y about its mean value.  Geometrically the problem is one of finding the equation of the plane which fits best, in the sense of least squares, a set of points in k + 1 dimensions.  The equation will be of the form:  y’ = Sum [ a(j) . x(j)] (j = 1 to k) where a(j) is the coefficient to be found for each x(j).  \nTaking the partial differentials of the sum of the least squares expression yields k separate equations which must be solved to obtain each of the a(j).  \nEquation j will then be of the form:  Sum [ a(i) . Sum [ x(j) . x(i) ] ](i = 1 to k) = Sum [x(j) . y] \nNowadays, one would use one of the multivariate spreadsheet packages which include matrix analysis such as that in MS Excel, and it’s all a lot easier.

The Voice of Russia web-site mentions that a few of the alleged relics from the True Cross proved to be fir, and I guess there wouldn’t have been much of that ever growing in Jerusalem. \nI’ve written postings on the Vera Crux on this site before.  The Crusaders carried the cross-beam, found by Helena, as a talisman into battle; It was lost in 1187 on the field of Hattin in Galilee in the Frankish battle with Saladin, who dragged it tied to the tail of his horse through the streets of Damascus, after which it disappeared.  I guess his soldiers might have used it for firewood.  I’d say there wouldn’t be many authentic relics from the cross-beam, although possibly some fragments might have found there way back to Europe. \nA surviving fragment of Helena’s Titulus Crucis was said to have been rediscovered in 1492 in the Church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome.  The surviving fragment is clearly only a portion of the original.  It weighs 687 gm, measures 25.3 cm × 14 cm × 2.6 cm, is made of walnut wood, was originally painted white, and with incised letters showing traces of red or black.  The sequence of the lettering is Hebrew (or Aramaic), Greek and Latin, which is at variance with the gospels of Luke and John who both give different sequences.  Some have argued that this sequence difference is an argument against forgery. The Greek and Latin lettering reads from right to left, either through ignorance or as a parody of the Hebrew.  In 2002, the University of Arizona conducted carbon dating tests, and asserted that the present artifact was made between 980 and 1146 AD.  But of course we’ve heard all about problems with C14 tests before.  On the other hand it may have been intended as a replica of the original, which certainly existed as attested by several witnesses including Egeria 383 AD, Antoninus 6th c, Saints Cyril of Jerusalem, Ambrose of Milan, and John Chrysostom.  \nA good reference work which makes a fascinating read on the True Cross is: “The Quest For The True Cross”:by Carsten Peter Thiede and Matthew D’Ancona; Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2000.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2012 at 7:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/voice-of-russia-relics-of-the-true-cross-and-more/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Voice of Russia: Relics of the True Cross and More"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"There are several bugs like this circulating at present.

Such bias as there was, seems merely to have originated with the anti-Idumean heredity of the Herods, which is extraneous to Revelations.  Nor do I see the vaw-vaw-vaw replication of 6-6-6 in the text. \nThe Greek texts – both 1550 & 1894 Textus Receptus & the Byzantine Majority – use the Greek numerals khi-xi-sigma.  The sigma appears to be a possible typo for the obsolete letter digamma, as otherwise sigma had the value 200, but being placed at the right suggests here a units value.  [khi = 600, xi = 60, digamma = 6]  The texts, Alexandrian and Hort & Westcott, both give the number in words “exakosioi exikonta ex”, and which Jerome transcribes in words as “sescenti sexaginta sex”.  Clearly the number is six hundred and sixty-six, and not six-six-six.  \nIfrah’s text on the history of numbers [From One to Zero] has a comprehensive chapter on gematria giving several Hebrew, Greek and Arabic examples.  \nThe transliteration he gives for applying the number to Nero is QSAR NERON, which he transcribes into their Hebrew equivalent, but reading from right-to-left as:\n“nun-vaw-resh-nun,  resh-samekh-qoth” thus “50-6-200-50, 200-60-100” which adds up to the number 666.  \nThe Book of Revelations makes the greatest sense to me when I see it in terms of the imperial persecution of the early Christians along the lines as interpreted by Stendahl & Sander as I’ve summarised above.\n\n","date":"June 24, 2015 at 8:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/was-laudato-si-and-the-popes-visit-to-the-shroud-related/","cat":"2015","title":"Was Laudato Si and the Pope’s Visit to the Shroud Related?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Others, not only Max, have commented on the number of the beast in this thread.

The examples I have given all show the number was interpreted as six hundred and sixty six.\nhttp://www.greeknewtestament.com/B66C013.htm , see verse 18. \nIs Max able to demonstrate an original text supporting the argument that the number was meant to be six-six-six?  \nMost of the several gematria examples given by Ifrah, tend to commence with a given text or phrase from which a number such as a date or a year can be derived.  Going in reverse from a number to a presumed text, as in Rev 13:18, seems more unusual a practice and is obviously fraught with ambiguities in interpretation.   \nThe only evidence for Herod the Great’s purported massacre of infants is given in Matthew’s infancy narrative, and seems to be a literary ruse so he can bring Jesus out of Egypt as the new Moses.  There is no other historic evidence for this crime, although there were several crucifixions and executions of Jews about this time resulting from a few rebellions and riots.  \nI am of the opinion that the Herodian dynasty did a lot more good for the Jewish people than evil which was overstated by the Jewish writers including the evangelists, but this went unappreciated because of their Idumean ancestry.  Herod the Great himself sold much of his own silver to purchase bread during a Jewish famine, and he frequently intervened with Rome on their behalf to forestall imperial offending of Jewish religious sensibilities.  \nHowever I do see merit in Max’s occasional mention of the verses in Rev 19:11-16 where the cloak worn by the rider of the white horse, “Faithful and True” may be a hidden reference to the Shroud.\n\n","date":"June 25, 2015 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/23/was-laudato-si-and-the-popes-visit-to-the-shroud-related/","cat":"2015","title":"Was Laudato Si and the Pope’s Visit to the Shroud Related?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"On the Book of the Revelation to John: \nThe Revelation (i.e., Apocalypse) to John is an answer in apocalyptic terms to the needs of the church in time of persecution, as it awaits the end-time expected in the near future. The purpose of the book is to encourage and admonish the church to be steadfast and endure.\nThe form of an apocalypse shows affinities with contemporary Jewish, Oriental, and Hellenistic writings in which problems of the end of the world and of history are linked both with prophecy of an eschatological nature and with “sealed” secret mysteries. Such revelations are traditionally received in trances, characterized by strange symbols, numbers, images, and parables or allegories that represent people and historical situations.\nApocalypticism is essentially dualistic, presenting the present eon as evil and the future as good, with an ultimate battle between the divine and the demonic to be won only after one or more cosmic catastrophes. The aim of apocalyptic literature is to depict in the age of present tribulation a knowledge of a future glorious victory and vindication, thus giving hope and assurance. \nIn Revelation, it is God who gives the revelation to Jesus Christ to be shown by Christ through an angel to his servant John, in exile on the island of Patmos, in order that John become his seer and prophet to the church. John is to write down what he has seen, what is, and what is to come. In contradistinction to most Jewish apocalyptic works, Revelation is not pseudonymous and John is to give finally unsealed, clear prophecy related to the present and to the end-time.\nAs in the rest of the New Testament, the starting point of eschatological hope is the saving act of God in Jesus, a historical centre pointing toward historical developments that will bring about the establishment of God’s kingdom and vindication of his people, ransomed by the blood of Christ, the Lamb who was slain. It provides certainty and encouragement with the example of the faithfulness of those who have already witnessed unto death (martyrs) and their reward-special inheritance in the eternal kingdom.\n… …\nThe letters sent from the heavenly Christ through John (chapters 2 and 3) exhort, comfort, or censure the churches according to their condition under persecution or danger of heresy. From chapters 4-22 there are series of visions in three main cycles, each recapitulating but expanding the former in greater and clearer detail with groups of seven symbols predominating in each (seals, chapters 6-7; trumpets, chapters 8-10; and bowls, chapters 15-16). \nThis material is interspersed with visions of God in his heavenly council, various visions of catastrophe and of Satan, the destroyer, the appearance of two witnesses and other martyr examples to spur the church to endurance, the victory of the archangel Michael over the dragon (Satan) by the blood of the Lamb (Christ), and the representation of the powers of emperor cult and false prophecy as beasts who bring destruction to the unfaithful in God’s judgment. \nIn summary, the seer reminds the reader that the words, because they are of God, are trustworthy and true. The motif that the Lord is coming soon is again repeated. This reflection of the early Christian watchword suggests a sacred liturgical style. The last verse is the closing benediction-perhaps not only of the letters in the beginning of Revelation but of the whole of Revelation, which was to be read aloud in a worship setting. \nApocalypticism was introduced into Asia Minor after AD 70 (the fall of Jerusalem), and c. 80-90 a prophetic circle was formed near Ephesus. Its leader was John, a prophet, who might well have been the author of Revelation, which is deeply steeped in apocalyptic traditions. \nThe “Johannine circle” bearing the tradition of John, the Apostle of the Lord, and from which emerged the Gospel and letters bearing his name, might have been a continuation of the prophetic conventicle of Ephesus in which John was prominent. The various writings do not have to be consistent except in their basic faith in Jesus Christ; and, as the situations to which they addressed themselves were different, different styles and content were required.\nThe seer was probably involved in an actual historical situation in the late 80s under Domitian, a time when there was open conflict between the church and the Roman state. \nThere is a tradition supported by Irenaeus, a 2nd-century bishop of Lyons, that in this persecution punishment was death or banishment. John’s prominence might have led to banishment to Patmos, an isle off the coast of Asia Minor, from his homeland in or around Ephesus. From Patmos he wrote a circular letter to the churches in Asia.  \n… … Revelation is written in fantastic imagery, blending Jewish apocalypticism, Babylonian mythology, and astrological speculation. It is pictorial, dramatic, and poetic. \nRevelation contains long sections characterized by Greek that is grammatically and stylistically crude, strangely Hebraized to give a unique, almost Oriental, colour. This may have been deliberate. Although Revelation is replete with Old Testament allusions, there are no direct quotations, and this may reflect the seer’s conviction that the work is a direct revelation from God. \nIn other sections the poetry of Revelation might stem from the seer’s experience in the heavenly throne room of God, from hearing the hymns of the angelic host, or from his recollection on Patmos of the liturgical practice of the church. The image of the Bride and wedding feast together with the “Come, Lord Jesus!” have associations with the eucharistic liturgy of the early church.\n… …\nThe mysterious name of the first beast, 666, in 13:18, can be calculated by “gematria,” assigning their numerical values to letters of the word and summing them up. The most adequate solution is Nero (the numerical value of the Hebrew letters for Caesar Neron equals 666), a demonic Nero redivivus (revived), who returns from the dead as Antichrist.\n… …\nThe cosmic battle in heaven is fought by those willing to give their lives, who mix their blood with the blood of the Lamb, whose blood “ransomed men for God.” The writer of Revelation based his hope for the church on perseverance, on endurance even to death, and on what the future will bring when the church will live with the glorified Christ, slain as a lamb. The harlot of Babylon will be destroyed and the church will endure; Babylon falls and the new Jerusalem, the city of God that is to come, is depicted in all its glory. These are the hopes to strengthen the persecuted church, assurance that God will soon triumph. With trumpet call and heavenly voices there is the joyful promise that “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.”  \nThese selected extracts originally by Rev.

I didn’t say there were no angels, there may well have been.  But it would be pointless for Providence to send angels if angels were not already part of the cultural understanding!

The point is made that tests are proceeding to test the ink which should give a definitive answer one way or the other.  Karen King has not asserted that the fragment is authentic at all, but in her position she has to remain open to the possibility until proven otherwise. \nThe fragment has nothing to do with Dan Brown theories despite the titillation aroused.\nThere is a general misunderstanding abroad, particularly among Christians, about the role of a University Religious Studies department or faculty, a discipline in which I happen to hold a NZ Bachelor’s major.  It is the function of such a faculty to study ALL aspects of ALL religions, not just one’s own favourite brand of Christianity.  In my studies we covered Biblical Studies, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, various Oriental Religions, Zorastrianism, Ancient Mesopotamian Religions, Polynesian, Maori, Melanesian and Aboriginal Religions, as well as Modern Critical Issues in Religion to name a few.  I have presented at Stage III seminars papers on Baal Hadad, Epic of Gilgamesh, Pope Leo XIII’s social encyclicals, Hans Kung and Teilhard de Chardin.  I have read up on Gnostic Writings, studied the Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, Confessions of Augustine, countless Catholic and Protestant writers and so on.  None of this has compromised my own Catholic Faith, but in fact I feel it has broadened and deepened it.  Critics of such studies migh reflect that the great Jesuit missionary St Francis Xavier considered it important in missionary work that there should be a full understanding of a peoples’ culture if such work was to succeed and bear fruit. \nGnostic scripture is a valid research topic for any University Religious Studies department.  Much of the Nag Hamadi scriptures go towards confirming what Iraeneus and other Church Fathers had to say about gnosticism which up until recently was all that was known about it, from these naturally hostile sources.  \nI quote a recent news report: “The text is not evidence Jesus was married, said the professor, Karen L. King, a historian of early Christianity at Harvard Divinity School, who is scheduled to discuss her discovery at an international gathering of Coptic scholars in Rome on Tuesday. But she said it may cast new light on the history of early Christianity, including the formation of Christian views of celibacy and whether women were members of Jesus’s inner circle (etc)”  \nNevertheless, the sensation mongers will continue to make more of this ALLEGED finding than can at present be justified.  That cannot be helped, but is just part of the tiresome modern business of people making a living from news gathering and its presentation.\n\n","date":"September 25, 2012 at 7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/24/when-asses-flew/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When Asses Flew"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It seems significant that portraits of Pope Pius XII pervade the Mundabor blog.

But we are also told that there will come a day of a new creation. What its nature might be, we may only speculate. \nAnthropologically, such cults as relics, and even the cloak of Elisha, probably owe their first origins to expressions of primitive magic, particularlly of “contagious magic”, where certain specific objects were believed endowed with magical properties, communicated by touch, such as is still practised in the use of relics for healings. There are several instances of the use of objects in the gospels and in Acts, Jesus’ garments and Paul’s apparel.\nI think that David Goulet’s remarks, that it is faith that creates the miracles, not the relics by their own power, is close to the mark.

The last ten years of my engineering career were spent in the Internal Audit department of a major national organisation in New Zealand. It was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding times of my working life.  Conventionally, Auditing is often thought of as focusing on monetary issues, but during the 1990s I noticed that its scope tended to become extended to a wide variety of other important public activities, with recruiting of a variety of professions well beyond its traditional focus on mere accounting.  I attended a number of auditing conferences, including an international conference in Auckland.  One of the conference highlights I recall was an audit paper focusing on environmental activities for example.  The matter of licensing for various patented processes and franchises is commonly a subject for professional audit, where the reputation of the process may be at stake.  Essentially auditing is concerned with providing assurance, and this as I see it is the purpose of “peer-review” of scientific papers and their related claims.  Auditing has its own literature on technical processes, sampling methods, and standards.  It is supported by a vast network of a wide variety of general and specialised auditing associations directed at auditing education and standards. \nMy own work was focused on providing assurances for various major capital-intensive engineering projects, as to their feasibility, the associated risks, and the likelihood of realising the benefits claimed for them (pre-audit), as well as post-audits to provide a data-base of experience, and current audits, ungluing stalled projects. \nHowever, auditors (read “peer-reviewers”) are all-too human and the audit process can be corrupted by failures of objectivity, personal interests and bias, or telling the customer what they would prefer to hear, rather than telling it as it is. Historically in NZ, we have even had an Auditor-General who was sacked on a corruption charge because of misuse of a credit-card. I also observed that there seemed to be a few major international auditing organisations whose methods and training seemed somewhat lax and did not meet what I believed to be adequately rigorous professional standards. The adverse non-objective reaction to Yves Delage’s paper in 1902 will be well-known to Shroudies. \nProper Peer-review processes needs to meet the same high standards that are aspired to in every other branch of auditing and provision of professional assurances.\n\n","date":"April 7, 2013 at 5:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/07/when-it-comes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-has-peer-review-lost-its-luster/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When it Comes to the Shroud of Turin, Has Peer Review Lost its Luster?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"In his replies to ‘Weaving fan’, Jones missed out using the argument that cotton contamination in the Raes sample shows that the cloth cannot be of European manufacture, but had to be from the MIddle East.

I am wondering if the dye found suggests that it was a medieval repair, rather than an ancient repair, as also might be suggested by the C14 tests.  In that case it takes us back to the absence of vanillin as possibly the only remaining argument that the main cloth is of ancient provenance, but that it does not locate the origin as either Europe or the Middle East.

He believes that Bishop Avercius was given temporary custody of it ~200 AD to convert the court of Abgar the Great in Edessa, thus giving rise to the Abgar legend whose true meaning is deliberately concealed by an allegory (by citing a predecessor), and also to the Hymn of the Pearl, and then it was returned to Antioch.  When Persian king Chosroes attacked Antioch in the 6th century, he believes that Bishop Ephraemius took it to Anatolia and hid it there for safe-keeping, but died before he could retrieve it.

Yale remains neutral on the subject and merely consider themselves the guardians of a valuable and controversial manuscript.

Any stats handbook or elementary text will explain its significance and how it is calculated. A very large number of measurements of the same property of an object will have a scatter which can be expressed as a ‘sigma’. If there more than about 10 measurements then the distribution will approximate to the “normal distribution” and it can be expected that some 95% of the measurements will be within 2 sigma of the mean. If there are fewer than 10 measurements, then the “Students’ t” distribution should be used. If the measurements don’t show this, then we get into the area of Type I and Type II errors, which is explained in the text-books. \nI know little about the techniques of carbon dating, but I believe that “calibration” refers to the modification of the theoretical dating curve (an inverse exponential) because of historic variations of C14 in the atmosphere. One method of calibration is by counting ancient tree rings, and testing the wood for its C14 age, and making the necessary date corrections to obtain a standard curve.

I would therefore not look there for any biblical exegesis on the matter of earthquakes as they are beyond their ken, no matter whether the exegetes are evangelical pastors or even editors of newsletters of the BSTS. \nTo those of us living on the “ring of fire”, such as Japan, California, Chile or New Zealand, earthquakes are an everyday occurrence, and we design our buildings and structures to take account of them. Most of them are scarcely felt and of no great significance. In NZ perhaps we get at least one earthquake of around M*6 about once per year. In the last 24 hours as I write this, there have been three in NZ of around M*3, and one of M*5.\nhttp://www.geonet.org.nz/quakes/felt \nCompared to the more active “ring of fire” localities, Israel is an area of moderate seismic activity. In 2013 there were several shocks of around 3.5, In 1927 there was a 6.2 which killed 500, injured 700; and in 1837 an earthquake left 7000 dead. The effects of an earthquake event will depend a lot on how well buildings and structures have been engineered against earthquake. Countries of only moderate seismicity may in fact be more vulnerable as there is not the same awareness in the more active zones, and they are less prepared for them. \nStephen Jones exegesis only refers to Matt 28:2 the “resurrection” earthquake (possibly an after-shock) and seems to ignore the “crucifixion” earthquake of Matt 27:51; “At that, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; the earth quaked; the rocks were split; the tombs opened …” all of which seems plain enough. Mk 15:38, and Lk 21:45 only refer to the temple veil being torn in two, which may be considered at least suggestive. All three synoptics also refer to the darkness. John’s account passes over these events. A resurrection after-shock provides a naturalistic explanation of a sealed rock being hurled from the tomb entrance. Boulders  are commonly hurled from rock faces because of the emerging P wave, and they may be tossed some tens of metres or more. That Matthew ascribes it to an angel suits his purpose of indicating some divine intervention. Some might ascribe the “angels” to the early perception of the Shroud body images, as does De Wesselow for instance. \nThe paper’s authors, as does Jones, become fixed on significant earthquakes said to have occurred in 33AD. They do not look further afield into the possibly more accurate dates of earthquakes occuring around April 7, 30AD.  Nevertheless, it is quite likely that such an earthquake might have gone quite unnoticed elsewhere, as it probably does not require such a major earthquake to produce the events reported in the gospel accounts.  Even a moderate earthquake could release sufficient radon to be an issue in producing the Shroud image, as De Liso has indicated from her moderate seismic region of Piedmont. \nNo recorded earthquake has ever been credited with modifying C14 dating of any known artifact or other object.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2014 at 3:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max came up with the Stuttgart Psalter image of the scourging scene some few years ago.  I found it intriguing:  the unusual depiction of a naked Christ; the dorsal view; the crossed hands over the pelvis; the flagellation marks; the two executioners either side; maybe even the alleged suggestion of epsilon finger signs.  \nHowever there seems to be a historical problem in associating it with a presumably Byzantine Shroud image.  The Psalter is said to be Carolingian, perhaps 800 – 814 AD.  At this time tensions between East and West were strained, and there seems to have been little close contact.  Note that the Mandylion did not arrive in Constantinople until 945, and it is not until after this that the supposed full image was revealed.  There are of course earlier suggestions of a full body image might have been known.  The time also coincides with an iconoclastic period in Byzantine history.  In the case of the Pray manuscript there is a link through King Bela III, who was for a time heir apparent to the Byzantine imperial throne. \nBut there seems to be no such historic link that might support the Stuttgart Psalter as being informed by the Shroud image.  I’d like to ask Max if he has any ideas on what any such historic links might have been.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2015 at 11:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"We have been here before at the link provided in Colin’s first comment above:\nhttps://shroudstory.com/2015/02/07/more-press-coverage-of-the-upcoming-cnn-series-about-jesus/  \nI had attempted an answer in my comment of Feb 8.  I even provided some clues as to the presence of the full length image seen in Constantinople and elsewhere.  But the discussion then degenerated into some infantile visual lampooning of my comments making sensible discussion impossible, and I do not seek to make the same mistake twice. \nBriefly, it was not only mere prudery that would have concealed the full length double image, but several other factors as well, and indeed it would be difficult if not impossible to identify a time window within the first millennium when the true nature of the Shroud image could have become publicly known.  \nSome of these factors included:  need for secrecy in face of imperial persecutions until the time of Constantine;  continuing need for later secrecy in face of imperial acquisitiveness of Passion relics;  early reluctance (based on O.T. prohibitions) to depict icongraphy until about the sixth century;  Periods of iconoclasm 726 – 786 & 814 – 842, with icon veneration not being restored until 843;  Byzantine reluctance to reveal to the public gaze those relics considered especially sacred (Mike M comment above);  Byzantine superstition concerning the use of Christ imagery on coinage and for military purposes; a specific reason relating to fear of earthquakes, and likely implicating the Shroud specifically.   \nPrudery also may indeed have played a part.  Even early crucifixion scenes showed a fully robed Christ on the cross.  The Syriac Gospel Book of 586 shows Christ dressed in a full length sleeveless tunic, and as late as the ninth century he wears a colobium over a loin-cloth or a perizoma. \nIn 740 AD Constantinople experienced a series of continuous earthquakes, and this would seem to mark the time when what is likely to have been the Shroud was sealed in a golden chest, and remained closed to all but the emperor for fear of further earthquakes, until about 1201 when it was then regularly displayed in an elaborate ritual.  This seems to have been the ritual observed by Robert de Clari in 1204.  \nThis Byzantine reluctance to expose those things considered particularly holy to the public gaze survive even to the present time.  A vestige of it might be seen in the use of the iconostasis during the consecration in the formal liturgy, concealing this sacred moment from the eyes of the general congregation.  Even in the Roman church until the 1950s we were taught that only the priest might touch the sacred vessels.  \nI mentioned that there were clues.  Perhaps the most salient can be found in the Hymn of the Pearl composed by the Edessan Hymnodist Bardesan about 200 AD, probably on the occasion of the baptism of the court of King Abgar VIII the Great.  It would seem likely that Bardesan might have had the opportunity to view the full-length image at this time. \nA Prince, the son of the King, is divested of his shining robe, and must wrest a pearl from the serpent;  he travels to Egypt, snatches pearl, returns home, but his robe now seems an image of himself;  There are several interpretation, but an obvious analogy is that of Christ being sent to redeem humanity from Satan.  The hymn concludes: \n“On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness. And the image of the King of kings Was depicted in full all over it…”   \nOne interpretation of this strange verse would seem to be: Mirrored image on previously clean robe represents mirrored image of Christ on his clean burial cloth; Robe’s reflecting images suggest ventral and dorsal sindonic images; Suggests that Bardaisan had seen the full body-image at Edessan royal court.  Note the particular recognition of a “Mirror Image”. \nYes, the verse is enigmatic, but recognizable in meaning in terms of the Shroud image.  It had to be enigmatic, to avoid provoking the Emperor in Rome.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2015 at 5:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I doubt that it’s valid to take measurements from the Abgar icon.

A heavenly vision revealed that the city would not be freed of such ill until such time as the linen cloth with the Lord’s face on it should be locked up and hidden away, far from human eyes. And so it was done. The sacred linen cloth was locked away in a golden case and carefully sealed up, and then the earthquake stopped and the heaven-sent ills ceased. From that time on nobody has dared to open the case or to see what might be inside it, as everyone believes and fears that if anyone tries to open it the whole city will be struck by another earthquake.”  \nAlthough it refers only to the face, it cannot be the Mandylion which had been frequently displayed since its arrival in Constantinople as recently as 945.  This cloth is evidently held in greater esteem than even the Mandylion.  The only other acheiropoietos Christ-image impressed upon linen then present in the city of Constantinople was the Image of God Incarnate.  The reference to the face can be easily attributed to the writer’s limited understanding of what the golden case actually contained. \nThere were two significant candidate earthquakes in Constantinople which might have prompted this seclusion of the relic, the series in 740, and another in 869.  Damage was limited in the 869 quake and it could not be described as continuous, but the 740 series of quakes endured for a year: \n“In the same year (740) a violent and fearful earthquake occurred at Constantinople on 26 October, indiction 9, a Wednesday, in the 8th hour. Many churches and monasteries collapsed and many people died. There also fell down the statue of Constantine the Great that stood above the gate of Atalos as well as that of Atalos himself, the statue of Arkadios that stood on the column of the Xerolophos, and the statue of Theodosios the Great above the Golden Gate, furthermore, the land walls of the City, many towns and villages in Thrace, Nicomedia in Bithynia, Prainetos, and Nicaea, where only one church was spared. In some places the sea withdrew from its proper boundaries. The quakes continued for twelve months.”  [Theophanes, A.M. 6232, p. 412.6 ff]  \n‘The imperial covenant with God was broken at the turn of the thirteenth century. Nicholas Mesarites’ statement, in 1201, that Jesus’ resurrection was being reenacted in Pharos Chapel ceremonials which involved a sindon that had “…wrapped the mysterious, naked dead body after the Passion” confirms that he, and the other participants in this rite, had viewed the image, very likely whenever they lifted the cloth to a vertical position. Three aspects of Mesarites’ statement identify this sindon as the Turin Shroud: his description of the body as naked, his use of the adjective aperilepton, meaning “unoutlined”, which aptly describes the relic’s blurry image, and his claim that the cloth had defied destruction, alluding no doubt to the fire damage evidenced by the relic’s so-called “poker holes”. ‘ [Markwardt, St Louis conference paper]  \nThe covenant was evidently broken by the disreputable emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195-1203).  He was deposed by the leaders of the Fourth Crusade at the instigation of the newly-installed Byzantine co-emperors, Isaac and his son, Alexios IV.  His serial treachery and flagrant desecration of the tombs of his imperial predecessors amply demonstrate that he cared nothing about loyalty or honor, and that he would have thought nothing of breaking a centuries-old imperial covenant with God. \nSo that for some 460 years from 741 to 1201, the Shroud had been consigned to utter obscurity.\n\n","date":"December 7, 2015 at 2:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It seems clear enough that the Mandylion was not the cloth that was sealed in a golden case, such that all but the emperor were forbidden to view it, as reported in the Tarragon manuscript. \n[In 1995, a Byzantine scholar, Krijnie N. Ciggaar, published a French translation of the anonymous Tarragonensis 55 (generally known as the Tarragon manuscript), datable to ca. 1075-1098, written in Latin, and maintained in the Public Library of Tarragon, Spain: Ciggaar, Krijnie N., Une Description de Constantinople dans le Tarrogonensis 55’, Revue des Etudes Byzantines 53, pp. 117ff. (1995). ]\nNor would it seem were there any disastrous earthquakes in Constantinople following the Mandylion’s arrival there in 945, that would have prompted such an action.  But there were such earthquakes there in 740 and a lesser one in 869.  \nPrior to its departure from Edessa, the Mandylion had been viewed several times during the preceding centuries, its container had been opened and the cloth had been viewed by the clergy and the faithful.  Bishop Abramios of Samosata had closely inspected it on its acquisition by the Byzantine Army.  On its arrival in Constantinople it had been viewed by the emperor’s sons after having been carried in procession.  Symeon Metaphrastes recites that, upon the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople, “everyone was looking at the marvelous image of the Son of God on the holy cloth … “.  John Skylitzes’ Synopsis of Byzantine History recites that, in 1036, the Mandylion was carried in procession through the capital in an attempt to end a six-month drought, and Abu Nasr Yahya, a Christian-Arab writer, claims to have viewed the icon within the Hagia Sophia Cathedral in 1058.  It is virtually certain that some Byzantine artists were given access to the Mandylion in order to produce the copies which are dateable to 944-ca. 1090.  \nThis is in stark contrast to the cloth described in the Tarragon manuscript, hidden from all eyes except that of the emperor!  So, what was it?  \nThere is little mention, if any, of the Image of God Incarnate after the iconoclasm periods of 726 – 786, and 814 – 842.  Some had therefore concluded that this Image had been destroyed during the iconoclasm.  However there is no known report of this image having been destroyed.  In fact, as it was acheiropoietos, “not made by human hands” its destruction would have been deemed a sacrilege, as opposed to those images that had been made by human hands, and so deemed legitimate targets for destruction.  Fr Heinrich Pfeiffer believes it was not so destroyed, but possibly adopting a Mandylion = Shroud thesis, he associates it with the Veil of Manoppello.  I have been unable to discover his justification for this conclusion, but perhaps someone else might know his reason.  \nNote that the 740 year of the severe continuous earthquake coincides with the first iconoclasm period, and might well be deemed a justification for ongoing iconoclasm, if depictions of icons were deemed to prompt divine wrath such as in the form of earthquakes, or incidentally even military defeats. \nHowever the fact that the Image of God Incarnate, aka Image of Camuliana, was deemed to be acheiropoietos, would be sufficient to shield it from iconoclasts, and so the solution of sealing it away in a golden casket hidden from all eyes would be adopted. \nThere are several problems in the attempt to identify the Mandylion with the Shroud, as many have reported.  But it seems that a Shroud-like image was being displayed in the Pharos chapel in 1201 accoring to Nicholas Mesarites.  And yet the Mandylion continued to be separately identified in the inventories. \nA good case can be made for the survival of the Image of God Incarnate from the iconoclastic period, that it was the cloth sealed away in a golden casket for some 460 years, hidden away from all eyes except those of the emperor, and this was the cloth that came to be known as the Shroud of Turin.\n\n","date":"December 10, 2015 at 5:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/why-didnt-i-think-of-that/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Why Didn’t I Think of That"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Mario, the extract from the Tarragon manuscript I quoted at Dec 7, 2:46 pm, refers to the cloth being locked up as a result of continuous disastrous earthquakes.

This might account for the absence of any representation of the Shroud double image from the first millennium.

Upon returning to Hungary, after his betrothal was annulled, his recollections of what he saw may have informed the illustrator of the Hungarian Pray Codex.

The contacts with Eric Jumper and Bill Mottern then naturally followed with the discovery of the remarkable properties yielded by the VP8 analyser.  The results of Frei’s pollen sampling were also coming to light at this time. It would be natural to expect that the two discoveries, the VP8 images and the pollens, linked with the earlier pioneer forensic studies, might have had a profound effect on the attitude of Jackson and his early cohorts on how they might then perceive the authenticity of the Shroud. \nHowever the final STURP team expanded to some 30+ scientists of various backgrounds and specialties.  Not all of them were particularly religious.  The interest the topic generated in most of them seems to have come from the enigmatic properties of the object of their study, and its largely unknown aspects, rather than from any particular religious viewpoint. A few were known to be agnostic, there were dissenters, but for the most part they seemed to have pursued their investigations in as professional a manner as could be achieved under the constraints they had to work within. The initial attitude of many seems to have been downright skepticism, and it was only through the application of their various scientific inputs, that they came to a greater respect towards the object of their enquiry. \nThe one bad apple in the whole bunch seems to have been the close-minded Walter McCrone, who seems to have betrayed the trust placed in him, as the main recipient of the blood-stained tapes.\nIt is perhaps also unfortunate that the STURP team lacked some desirable expertise in a knowledge of textiles, and in artistic iconography. However, it did its job as well as it could under the circumstances, and its conclusions can hardly be said to be tainted by any kind of religious bias.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 4:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/27/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-solid-as-a-brick-wall/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Solid as a Brick Wall"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"2Tim 3:16: “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,”  Elsewhere scripture says “My ways are not your ways, it is the Lord who speaks!” These suggest to me that there are higher truths than what the biblical literalists would have us believe.

He also happens to mention discussing the matter with some abattoir officials who were familiar with this emptying of the vena cava during the killing of oxen. \nThe blood was therefore either lost or collected. Only that remained which coagulated on the skin, to a limited extent while it was flowing.

Mark’s is the basic original narrative, and the other evangelists have built on it either adding material known to them, or else omitting material by way of refinement.  The basic events are that Joseph took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and placed him in the tomb. \nIndividual additions are:  ‘laid in a tomb hewn out of the rock’; ‘rolled a stone against the entrance’; ‘no-one had yet been buried there’;  ‘it was Joseph’s tomb and he had hewn it’; ‘Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes’;  ‘bound the body with burial cloths along with the spices’; ‘there was a garden and the tomb was close by’.  \nConcerning transport, Barbet notes that the Shroud image blood-stains indicate a minimum of handling, that the tomb was close by, and the body would have been completely stiff in a state of rigor mortis.  He creates the scenario whereby the nail is removed from the feet, the cross-piece is lifted off the upright, two men carry the cross-piece, two men support the mid-section using something like a twisted sheet, and one man supports the feet.  \nHe notes that this explains the dorsal blood-stain at the waist, and that there is a small smudge mark on the foot.  Very likely the head-wrap placed during crucifixion still covered the face, and is only removed during the laying out.  Under this scenario, no cloth is required to protect the carriers from gore, and the lack of smudging even suggests that not even a modesty cloth was used.  \nIt would not be possible to place the body in a transport stretcher without removing the nails from the hands and the cross-piece, breaking the rigor at the shoulders, and then forcing the arms down to the sides.  As the tomb was close by, there was no need for this.  Even transporting the body on a stretcher a very short distance would have resulted in smudging;  there is none.  We can forget the stretcher scenario.   \nSeveral forensic pathologists who have examined either the Shroud or its photographs or both, have been convinced that the image was that of a real corpse, not merely a picture of one, that the man was a victim of scourging and crucifixion, and they have given their various forensic analyses.  Various explanations have been offered for the colour of the blood-stains. \nWhatever the shortcomings of Max Frei’s work, he had been trained in botany, was a noted criminologist , head of the Zurich Police Scientific Laboratory 1948-72, had analysed several important crimes and accidents including the air crash of UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, and even in retirement was still consulted by the police forces of many nations.  His work on Shroud pollens has been supplemented by Israeli botanists Danin and Baruch and also by palynologist Thomas Litt.  \nHugh Farey to my knowledge has not been trained in palynology,  His objection to the identification of insect-borne pollens is irrelevant.  The gospels make the point of a garden at the burial site, it was spring and the flowers would have been in full bloom.  Whether the pollens arrived on the cloth by insects or by mourners placing flowers there, is beside the point.  Palynology is a difficult science and there are ambiguities, but there remains sufficient indication of a Middle East provenance. \nThe image shows travertine arogonite limestone, consistent with Jerusalem limestone, not only on the soles of the feet (road-dust) but also on the nose and the knee.  The arch-fraudulists might have us believe that their model coated with flour paste or whatever else, suffered a fall on his way to the artist’s studio, and accumulated this debris from the caves of Troyes.  \nWe know that Geoffrey I de Charnay was a virtuous knight of distinction, a devout Christian, and unlikely to be party to any kind of fraud.   Further there is sufficient evidence that the Byzantine imperial relic collection boasted of having a tradition of image imprinted burial cloths of the Saviour, and gave them various names, and that following the Frankish Crusader spoliation of Constantinople in 1204, they were never seen there again. \nThere is absolutely no record of any medieval artisan creating the Shroud image, his imagined success remains inexplicable, and he only ever did it once, not even leaving a relic of his attempts to do so.  As an Easter liturgical prop for the faithful, the Shroud lacks the artistry expected of such a rubric.  As evidence of an historic crucified Christ, it is compelling.\n\n","date":"July 13, 2015 at 7:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I’m sorry that the thread prompting Colin’s promoted comment above has been broken as I have no wish to go to the trouble of repeating myself in response to it.  \nIn the original posting, Colin had asserted that, based on the synoptic gospels, the fine linen brought by Joseph of Arimathaea was not the same as the burial cloth used to wrap the body, but in fact was merely used for transport.  I believe I successfully refuted that, Colin seemed to have no answer to it, and all he could do in reply was to make the comment posted above, essentially reverting to his argument that the Shroud was the result of a medieval thought experiment. and accusing me of a pro-authenticity argument.  That is not the case as he very well should know, as my comments were specifically directed at his faulty interpretation of the synoptic accounts.  \nI had made no comment whatsoever concerning miraculous flashes of radiation, a scenario I do not subscribe to, and it is egregious of him to include it in his argument. \nIt is reasonable to claim that the image of a corpse on a cloth of fine linen may very well have been a burial shroud of a kind, and his pleading that this is no more than a pro-authenticity argument, is in fact no more than an anti-authenticity argument.  Touche! \nHis continuing insistence that authenticists ought to see it as no more than being used for transport, when there is no scriptural evidence that any cloth, let alone one of fine linen, was ever used as such, itself begs the question, a complaint he makes of others.  \nEssentially the synoptics say that Joseph brought a Shroud, took the body down, wrapped it in fine linen, and laid it in the tomb, no mention of using it for transport at all. \nNow if he wants to concentrate on a medieval thought experiment, he should talk about that, and not introduce faulty extraneous material diverting discussion away from the subject.  \nThere are adequate reasons to call the cloth a burial Shroud, as that what it seems to be, many who have examined it in detail were so convinced, and have offered their evidence in support of their contention.  However there is no record whatsoever of anyone having come up with any kind of medieval thought experiment to create it, nor of repeating his endeavours, nor do we yet know how he might have gone about it, nor can we guess who it might have been.  It is purely a speculative induction based on a reluctance to acknowledge that it might in fact actually be Christ’s burial cloth.  \nBut I congratulate Colin for his industry in venturing into his experimental approach.  Either one way or another, we might learn from his efforts how the image was formed or not, as the case may prove to be.\n\n","date":"July 13, 2015 at 5:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I recall having  read Rudolf Otto’s “Idea of the Holy” as part of a university course some thirty years ago, was much taken by it notwithstanding he was a Protestant author, seem to recall having to write a Stage III essay on it, I still have the book, and I think my opinion of it would still be one of praise.  I think Otto seemed to have a good understanding that God’s ways are not man’s ways, and  made it very clear that God is not to be judged in terms of human standards – He is the ineffable!  If you do not understand the statement “mystery of a God sometimes awful”, I suggest you do not understand Otto. \nThe point is that God has given man the freedom to act how he will, and with it goes the responsibility of man to use that freedom for good, not evil.  If man uses his freedom to do evil, then it is man who has to be held accountable, not God!  That is the true meaning of sin!  It is man who has acted in an evil way.  For whatever reason, God does not choose to correct every evil act perpetrated by man.  Indeed, to do so, would be to abrogate man’s responsibility in the matter.  Otherwise, one might construct a scenario whereby man could do whatever he willed, secure in the knowledge that God would correct any consequent evil arising from such an act, and could then abdicate from the responsibility of his actions.  But that is not how our world works.   \nWhen it comes to the consequences of natural disasters, the earth will do what the earth does, whether it is earthquake, flood, storms or tsunami.  God has given man the intelligence to deal with such disasters, which are not to be seen as punishments from God as the old superstitions believed.  An illustration:  I read in the news of some moderate earthquake occurring where there are poor construction standards and which has had devastating effects with great loss of life.  However if the same earthquake occurred in New Zealand, California or Japan, then it would only have moderate effects with much less trauma, as engineers there have set construction standards to withstand such forces.  There was great loss of life in Japan following a tsunami there a few years ago.  The effect has been to create an awareness of the danger, and not have people rushing to the coast to ogle at the wonder of a tsunami.  To take an extreme case: If you build your house on a volcano, you are not entitled to be surprised at the consequences.\n\n","date":"January 3, 2015 at 5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It seems to me that during the course of human development that there have always been several pathways to God:  the primal (commencing with the Lascaux cave art of 30,000 years ago), the need for caring for the natural environment (apparent in the totemism of aboriginal clans), for social order ( the polytheisms of ancient civilisations), the revelatory (Abrahamic monotheism), the philosophical (beginning with Socrates), the Christ event, the mystical (search for a greater union with the ineffable), the miraculous (Fatima 1917, cures at Lourdes and by intercession).  \nWe do not need to shrink from the scientific path.

David Attenborough’s series on the evolution at Galapagos, which is currently being repeated on TVNZ is most curious, but leads me to come to rather different conclusions from those of an atheistic evolutionist. \nA benign God does not force himself onto the consciousness of his creation, but invites our belief, challenging us with the clues that he has given as to his reality.\n\n","date":"January 1, 2015 at 2:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"As David Mo indicates Science seems to work quite well without the God hypothesis, I dare say in much the same way as I seldom needed to have recourse to theology when attempting to resolve a difficult structural analysis problem.  But that seldom prevented me praying for enlightenment that I might achieve a solution for the more intractable problems.  \nThe case of Laplace is curious.  He was an avowed determinist, in much the same way as Omar Khayyam’s “And the first Morning of Creation wrote / What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.”  His major scientific contribution was in demonstrating the stability of the solar system, notwithstanding its apparent perturbations, Newton previously having concluded that divine intervention was occasionally necessary to restore equilibrium.  Laplace was able to announce the invariability of planetary mean motion (average angular velocity).  He is noted for his first use of the “potential function” in his gravitational work, and which subsequently found applications in such diverse fields as magnetism, electricity, heat flow, and fluid mechanics (specifically in the equation of continuity).  The Laplace partial differential equation is pervasive throughout physics. \nSurprisingly, despite his philosophic determinism, Laplace also made major contributions to the theory of probability, proving the Central Limit Theorem and that the distribution of errors in large data samples approximates to the normal distribution.  I am unaware of how Laplace reconciled his determinism with his achievements in probability.  I believe Laplace’s determinism was dealt the death blow, by the later discoveries in quantum mechanics, where everything seemed to be entirely probabilistic.  No underlying variables determining which specific atom would decay into another were found, only that a definite quantity ever did, leading to Einstein’s expression of frustration “The old one does not play dice with his creation”.  I think it may have been Schrodinger who  scolded Einstein “Stop telling God what to do with his dice”. \nThe problem of evil in a God-given world is perennial, and many great minds have attempted to address this problem, the most ancient being the Book of Job, albeit with a conclusion I consider unsatisfactory, as Job ends up by overcoming all his adversities, hardly the common experience of more general personal suffering.  It does attempt an answer to “Why do bad things happen to good people, while sinners may seem to prosper.”  Augustine and the ancient Jewish writers thought they found an answer in man’s first act of disobedience to God-given commands and a doctrine of original sin, together with some personified demonology. \nTo some extent it depends on how evil is defined.  Is it part of God’s plan, for example, that it is the “Selfish gene” that should predominate, and determine the course of evolution by ensuring endurance and hence survival of the fittest?  Is this what made Christ’s redemptive act necessary, but yet pointed to a better way in the command to “Love one another” rather than compulsively following the fallacy of exclusive self-interest?      \nApart from the adversities arising from Nature in its act of giving birth and final fulfillment, whatever that might come to, true evil always seems to be a product of man’s freedom to act in a way contrary to what his true nature ought to be.  Thus the Nazi holocaust was the product of men free to act in a way contrary to decent human values.  The excuse of “acting under orders” was never able to exonerate them.  Nor could it be said to be a product of Laplacian determinism, but despicable acts of men acting freely, and certainly under no compulsion from God. \nI appreciate that what I have written may convince no confirmed atheist, who sees the presence of evil as his principle argument against the divine.  However, if there is evil, there is also good, and we might well ask whence does good come from.  It is significant I think that we are able to discern the distinction between the two, and we should ask “how does that come about?”\n\n","date":"January 2, 2015 at 5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Bottom line:  Man cannot abdicate responsibility for the consequences of his actions by laying the blame elsewhere, whether it is the God-given freedom to act, or “the devil made me do it”, or else a stunted upbringing!

In 1828, Thomas Telford, the first President of the British Institution secured a Royal Charter which defined civil engineering as: “… being the art of directing the great sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man, …” .   Possibly the besetting sin of the engineer is that of Prometheanism, placing himself in the place of God, of which he is sometimes accused by lesser mortals.  \nNevertheless, few of my professional colleagues cannot have had the experience of being subject to idle sidewalk oglers all unqualified to a man beholding their efforts, each one of them utterly convinced that any fool could do a far better job of whatever enterprise was being undertaken at the time.  In local government work for instance it seemed a common habit of elected members of the employing authority wanting to make an otherwise undeserved name for themselves to make the engineer the whipping boy for the council’s own failures, as it seemed evident to them that every engineer was an incompetent idiot.  Such comments inevitably stemmed from an inability to grasp the inherent problems that the engineer was struggling to master at the time.    \nHowever the engineer is in good company.  It is evident from the above thread, that mere mortals consider that they could do a far better job of creation than the Almighty, given the same starting materials and skills.  It seems to be a manifestation of the same disease, with an undue focus on anthropocentrism.\n\n","date":"January 8, 2015 at 2:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"This posting began with the need for a dialogue between Science and Religion on the basis of  there seeming to be a strong case for intelligent design, which in the history of philosophy and religion has always been generalised as God.  Fundamentally the case is made on the existence of observed order in the universe which seems to demand an intelligent origin.  I had indicated that some of those indications might be found in what have come to be known as “Goldilocks Zones”, of which there are many, the existence of consciousness which seems otherwise inexplicable, and the enigma of quantum entanglement.  \nThe existence of evil does not negate any of these arguments, is a separate issue and cannot be used to disprove the existence of intelligent design in any rational way, however repugnant the evil.  ‘Evil’ cannot exist as a concept without the concept of ‘Good’, but it is evident that both ‘Good’ and ‘Evil’ also exist as practical realities.  What is ‘good’ and what is ‘evil’ has always been a moot point among philosophers and religionists who have considered these matters.  A utilitarian for instance would only see as good that which serves self-interest.  A Darwinist might only see as good that which enhances natural selection and survival of a species.  A Christian theologian would only see as good that which brings a person closer to his concept of God, and that is evil which alienates the person from God.  An agnostic humanist might depend on more emotive arguments involving the repugnance or appeal of specific acts. \nIt is evident that the existence of God has been an attractive concept for very many philosophers throughout the ages, from the time of the Greek and Jewish philosophers, the Christian scholastics, notably Aquinas, more latterly Immanuel Kant and various others.  However there is not unanimity on the matter, so clearly the question of God’s existence cannot be said to be a matter of certain knowledge.  It is necessarily a matter of a faith belief based on a personal assessment of evidence, but in view of the intellectual support for it, it may clearly be held as a rational belief.  \nI choose to belief in the existence of God because I think it more likely than not, and I believe that Jesus Christ is the human face of that God.  I also consider that modern civilisation owes a debt of gratitude to Christianity with its heritage in such fields as music, art, literacy and literature, mainly though monasticism and the founding of the first universities, the doctrinal motivation it provided in a wide assortment of charitable activities and beneficent altruism, together with its missionary activities making civilisation accessible to pagan societies previously held in the thrall of superstition.   \nIt was Aquinas who pointed to the order in the universe, unifying philosophy and theology, so that no longer were deities to be considered as capricious beings, but that order was to be expected, thus making the underpinning of the scientific revolution possible.  \nI also believe that God endowed man with the freedom to choose, a freedom which is not enjoyed by the lower orders which are only subject to natural instinct.  Moral choices are unavailable to lower animal life.  A sentient being capable of choosing between good and evil, but not capable of choosing evil, is a contradiction, in fact a “Nothing”, and I could respond to David Mo by saying that “Nothing is impossible to God!”  With that freedom goes the responsibility of choosing for good, and being held accountable for one’s actions. \nMary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” was subtitled ‘A Modern Prometheus’, so that the besetting sin of her mad scientist protagonist was that of ‘Prometheanism’, putting man in the place of God!  Thus her Doctor Frankenstein was indeed at fault.  \nI had resolved to contribute no longer to the web-site, as I have too often found it an exercise in fruitless frustration, but had relented in the case of this particular off-topic.  However I do not see it as my personal vocation to justify my preciously held beliefs to any committed atheist impervious to any rational argument to the contrary.  I do have more fruitful avenues  I can pursue, without indulging in idle word-play. Consequently, I propose no further comment on the subject.\n\n","date":"January 4, 2015 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"One purpose of my earlier engineering analogy was to demonstrate what a perilous and thankless task it is for anyone going around creating a Universe, more so for all we know, if one is inclined to make a habit of it, say creating multiple universes.  \nOne fundamentally starts with nothing, endows it with some dimensions, creates a singularity so that it all flies apart into matter and anti-matter, dissipate the antimatter, and give your matter some four or so fundamental forces, so that you get the quarks developing into the right kind of atomic particles which will form useful elements that can combine with one another after they’ve congregated into star systems.  After a few of the stars have gone through their life cycle in about 5 billion years, you can get a few super-novae started so that you can get some elements heavier than iron, as these will also be useful.  \nYou look around for some benign locations that seem fairly stable, and you’ve fixed things so that some of the lighter elements will form organic molecules which will eventually turn into double helixes for DNA and become life forms.  You know how useful competition is for ensuring survival and development of the better parts of this mix, so that these life forms will struggle against each other and a few will become dominant. \nAfter a few star cycles in about 14 billion years, and throwing some rocks around to extinguish the worst of the aggressive animals you begin to see signs of rudimentary intelligence in your mammalian life, particularly the primates.  They still compete with each other, but they’ve got to the point where they see advantages in social organisation and mutual cooperation and you’ve got the beginnings of some kind of moral order.  \nThe competition and selfish gene are eventually successful in producing something called homo sapiens, a sentient being capable of sustaining himself, having a moral conscience, and who is beginning to understand what this is all about, even becoming aware that all of this didn’t get going all by itself.  \nHowever, the quest for dominance and exploitation and primitive rudiments are still there, so that you know you’re going to have to send your divine Son along to sort out the worst of it, and to tell your Creation what it’s all about.  You give them due warning of this, by raising up a few prophets, enlightening them so as to prepare the way.  You know that some will listen, and that this will be enough for an enduring sense of right for at least a few thousand years.  However you also know that the worst of the lot will turn against him, he’ll get himself crucified and he’ll have to come home, but that’s OK. \nNotwithstanding all of the trouble you’ve taken to get this lot on the road to eventual salvation, you also know that like the engineer in the earlier story, you’ll still have idle sidewalk oglers, who’ll be asking “Why didn’t you do it differently?”  Some are never satisfied! \nDo you get the point of it all, yet??!!

I know a great deal more about Genesis than you give credit for, and I dare say more so than even yourself!  The problem of God’s omnipotence, perfection, innate goodness and foreknowledge, versus the problem of man’s free will and the pervasiveness of evil has exercised the greatest of minds since time immemorial.  Solutions to it were attempted in the two creation stories of Genesis, in the writing of the book of Job, in Socrates who mistakenly thought it sufficient merely “to know the good”, in Plato’s unrealistic idealism, Plotinus’ neo-Platonism which had a major impact on early Christian theology, in Augustine’s doctrine of original sin, and in Aquinas’ recovery of Aristotle’s philosophy from Averoes.  However, the problem only occurs because of the importance they all give to anthropocentrism,  I have said that “Nothing is impossible to God” and noted the inference this gives to what is in fact possible and impossible in creating a sentient being with free will capable of both good and evil.   \nMy rewriting of the Genesis story owes little to such mythologies of imagination, and the mental gymnastics of arm-chair philosophers, and a great deal more to the scientific facts of the case.  I am impressed with how life forms adapted remarkably quickly in their migration from South America to the hostile Galapagos in such a relatively short time as a few million years.  This could only be possible if the innate property of adaptability was implanted in them.  It required a struggle between competing individuals for dominance, and the dissolution of those unable to adapt, in fact a “selfish gene”.  This pervades all of Creation, is the product of a wise God, but has consequences for the problem of evil.  Man has now reached the stage in his development, where he can now seek solutions to many of these problems.  Christianity provides a frame-work, motivation and world-view for so dealing with it. \nThe way the world and the entire universe was created is evidently the best solution that is possible to be created.  I would liken David Mo and other such commentators to the comforters in Job, or as in my story, to idle uninformed sidewalk oglers who ask “Why didn’t you do it differently?”\n\n","date":"January 10, 2015 at 2:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Excellent point, jesterof!\n\n","date":"May 24, 2013 at 6:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/24/an-atheist-going-to-a-heaven-he-doesnt-believe-in/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"An Atheist Going to a Heaven He Doesn’t Believe In"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The loony literalists have a lot to answer for, as they bring both God and religion into disrepute, and no sensible or intelligent young person is going to believe in that type of religion, but nevertheless they still attract followers from the disillusioned, the hurt and the vulnerable.

People may either accept them or reject them and I don’t mind either way.  If they speak to anyone with a more scientific bent than mythological, that’s good!  If they don’t, that’s also fine.  \nI have already indicated that Creation in Gen II is an extremely ancient story, it was probably based on some kind of oral tradition.  In Gen II, God is anthropomorphic, He makes a woman from out of Adam’s rib indicating that they are of the same kind, He “walks in the garden”,  He can’t find Adam there and tries to search for him, He asks questions, “Where are you, Adam?”, there is a talking snake, and so on.  Nevertheless, like all primal mythologies, it has its own particular truth which mainly operates at the symbolic and psychological levels, and which spoke to the people then and can speak to us now.    \nDuring the 6th century BC, the Jewish people by their exile were exposed to the influence of Babylonian science, and one result of this was their writing down of the more cosmic Creation story of Gen I.  Nevertheless they did not abandon the older story, but placed it second in their setting down of the book of Genesis.  The setting down of Genesis I more accurately records the sequential order of the actual Creation process.  The “days of Creation” are of course not actual days of 24 hours, as reportedly explained by Pope John XXIII to Nikita Krushchev when they first met.  Or as another biblical text has it, a day in God’s eyes can be a thousand years, and a thousand years can be but a day.  \nThe perception of evils experienced by mankind, and promoted as an argument against God’s existence by David Mo and others, is based on the false premise that man is the supreme good.  There is a higher good, which may be found in necessity.  Man has been endowed with reason and intelligence, which enables him to progressively deal with the evils which trouble his species.

So we are talking fashionable Greek and Roman hair styles here, and not how a proper Jew in Jerusalem might groom himself.\nAs Saul, he had joined the Pharisee sect, avid for the literal compliance with the Law of Moses, but upon his conversion he seems to have turned his back on this and now castigated this Law which could not save. His mission was concerned with gentiles, Greeks and Romans, and the Jews had rejected him.  He himself had only ever seen Jesus as if in a vision, not in ordinary mortal life. \nHe closes off the discussion at verse 16: “But if anyone is inclined to be argumentative, we do not have such a custom, nor do the churches of God.” The whole section vv 4-16, is directed at appropriate dress in a Corinthian Christian church, no room for any long-haired hippies hair nor weirdie beardies. Nevertheless, long hair and beards continue to be the normal style in Jewsish congregations to this very day. Jesus had long hair and a beard! I wonder if Paul would have banned him from attending church? \nInteresting Shroud foot-note on Tarsus. During the Roman and early Byzantine periods, Tarsus was one of the leading cities of the Eastern Empire, with an economy based on agriculture and AN IMPORTANT LINEN INDUSTRY. Modern Tarsus continues to be a prosperous agricultural and cotton-milling centre.\n\n","date":"May 7, 2013 at 1:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Some various interesting issues raised above. My comments: \n1) Jason – Jesus & long hair.\nCheck out any image collection of Jewish Rabbis. For example:\nhttp://www.fotosearch.com/photos-images/rabbi.html\nExcept for modern liberals/radicals, and lady rabbis, they all usually wear long hair and untrimmed beards. There are any number of other examples. Just Google ‘jewish rabbis images’, there are vast quantities of images of Jewish rabbis. When archaeologists start digging in Jerusalem, they are soon confronted by long-haired bearded ultra-orthodox ready to stone them. Check out the recent video of Barrie Schwortz. Sparse and all as it may be (still more than what I have), Barrie wears what hair he has, long and there’s also a tuft of beard! \nThe earliest icons of Jesus tended to follow the Greek & Roman models of short hair and were beardless. There was a major change in the 6th century to a long-haired bearded Jesus, and there are strong correspondences with the Shroud image suggesting it may have been the template for the facial image. St Augustine claimed that no-one knew what Jesus looked like. But he lived in the West and wouldn’t have understood the reasons for these icon representations. \nThe evangelicals’ argument for a short-haired beardless Jesus, seems to be little more than a recent reaction to traditional Catholic portayals of Jesus. Possibly they may be influenced by their own westernised image of what constitutes proper Christian appearance. In other words they seek to make God in their own image and likeness instead of the other way around. Thankfully they haven’t yet got him in a white shirt and tie with matching dark jacket and pin-striped trousers! \n2) Did Jesus exist?\nThe idea that Jesus never existed as a real person is far more prevalent than is generally realised. There is a considerable body of scholarly opinion ready to argue that Jesus is little more than a fanciful re-creation from classical myths and legends. These assertions are addressed in an excellent work “Did Jesus Exist” by Bart Ehrman, an agnostic professor of New Testament studies, currently head of Religious Studies at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Ehrman makes a strong case for the existence of Jesus as a real historical person, providing several independent sources, and responding to the denyers.  Check out his blog site at:\nhttp://ehrmanblog.org/did-jesus-exist-as-part-one/\nHis book is available through Amazon. I read a copy from my local public library. \nThe Shroud gives testimony that a person suffered the extreme punishment of crucifixion in a manner described by the gospels, and provides supplementary corroboration of the real existence of the man Jesus. \n3) Question of the reality of the Resurrection:\nSome 15 years or so ago, I presented a seminar paper on the works of Catholic radical theologian Hans Kung. It seemed to me as I recall that Kung was prepared to interpret the Resurrection as a mystical or symbolic event, but which had no necessarily historical reality. At the time, I thought that here was an interpretation that many would-be Christians would be able to accept, and so remove a hurdle to their belief. It is a fact of our times that many would-be Christians are of a similar view, that the Resurrection as a real historical event is a hurdle that denies their full acceptance of Christianity. The liberal radicals, such as those in the ‘Jesus Seminar’ cannot accept it, seeing it as illogical and unthinkable. \nIn my previous posting #8 above, I posed a set of questions concerning the Shroud:\n“Why is the image that of an uncorrupted body, why are there no smears or tears in the cloth from removal of the body from its sticky surroundings, and where is the body that goes with this burial cloth??” There is only one reasonable answer!\n\n","date":"May 6, 2013 at 11:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A quick check of Michael Molnar’s eclipse web-site and the summary book reviews suggest he seems to have done a thorough job of research, on the astronomy events, and the then cultural perceptions of astrology. However I would certainly hesitate to place any significance on astrological interpretations or predictions. There have been various suggestions for an explanation of the Star of Bethlehem as there were a number of planetary conjunctions around this time. For eight months in 7BC, Jupiter and Saturn were within 3 degrees of each other; There was a triple conjunction of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter in early 6BC. Chinese annals record novae in 5BC and 4BC. \nAs to Jesus’ age, you need to relook your math. If born in 6BC, he would be aged 36 in 30AD and aged 39 in 33AD, the two favoured dates for the crucifixion when Preparation Day fell on a Friday. Herod the Great died in 4BC, so 6BC is a credible date for Jesus’ birth. From Luke 3:1, John the Baptizer began his preaching between the Augusts of 28AD and 29AD. This would support the synoptic inference of 18 months for Jesus’ mission if he died in 30AD but is a problem for the 3 year mission inferred from John’s gospel.\nIt cannot be known if Matthew’s story of the “magi” and the star is recording a real event or is a literary device. For example no other source records Matthew’s story of Herod’s slaughter of the infants, although there were several riots in Jerusalem around this time resulting in mass crucifixions and Herod’s arteriosclerosis had advanced, making him mentally unstable.  \nThere are three reasons why Matthew would use such a literary device. The first is that astrological signs were an accepted way of underlining and emphasising the importance of major events, such as the birth of a messiah, king or great leader. The second reason is that Matthew is speaking to a gentile church, so he brings in gentile wise men (Luke has Jewish shepherds). Matthew includes gentiles in Jesus’ genealogy and Jesus cures a Roman centurion’s servant and a Canaanite’s daughter.  A third reason is that Matthew wants to proclaim Jesus as the new Moses and so wants to bring him out of Egypt, but he has to get him down there first. So whether the story is actual or a way of stressing the significance of Jesus’ birth can be optional. You pays your money, and you makes your choice!\nI’ll stretch a point, and say that Providence has its own way of communicating its message, and maybe astrology was one of the ways in those times.\n\n","date":"May 9, 2013 at 9:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"1) Long hair again:\nFirstly I am not being dismissive of 1 Cor 11:4-16. But I see it in the context of what was to be considered the proper conformity of dress and appearance of a Corinthian Christian in the 1st century, as addressed by a missionary well familiar with Greek and Roman culture. It might be seen as unnecessarily socially provocative not to conform in this way. To then argue that therefore Christ was necessarily short-haired and beardless is grasping a straw and to read a message into scripture that is not there. \nIan Wilson in his 2010 book “The Shroud” gives several pictorial or iconic images of Christ. Until the 5th century, there were occasional portrayals of Christ as short-haired and beardless. From the 6th century, concurrent with the discovery of the Image of Edessa, whatever that might have been, the icons become standardised with long hair and forked beard. \nYou may look in vain for images of 1st century Jews to discover their hair style, as you would be aware that they were averse to any kind of images. However in his 1978 “The Turin Shroud”, Wilson cites two authorities quite independently of the Shroud, H Gressman and Daniel-Rops. Gressman’s work is in German; Daniel-Rops work is “Daily Life in Palestine at the Time of Christ” (Londom Weidenfeld 1962). Wilson points out that Aaron, Moses’ brother is specifically stated as having a beard, and beards were only shaved off as a sign of deepest mourning.\nGressman has apparently shown that an unbound pigtail was a common fashion for Jewish men in antiquity in the simple form of long hair caught at the back of the neck. Daniel-Rops claims that except on public holidays Jewish men wore this pigtail plaited and rolled up under their head-gear.\n2) Matthias – Bart Ehrman:\nEhrman as I recall claims to have been brought up as a conservative evangelical. He now claims to be an agnostic, not necessarily an atheist. Nevertheless he seems to be an excellent New Testament scholar, and his work on “Did Jesus Exist” I found quite intriguing. I found I was not able to agree with him on some minor technical details. For example he denies the the idea of the resurrection cycle of ancient fertility gods. I was only too well aware of the Phoenician Baal cycle epic having presented a seminar paper on that topic, which would contradict Ehrman’s viewpoint. There also seemed to me to be a few other minor errors. As he claims to be an agnostic, I would be cautious in accepting what he might have to say about Christ’s divinity, not having read the work. However he might have a useful perspective on how this viewpoint developed in the early church if based on cited sources, as I expect he would. \n3) Importance of Resurrection – Marcus Borg:\nI rather suspect that Borg’s viewpoint might not be too far removed from Kung’s which I mentioned previously. I mentioned that it had some appeal for me at the time I read it, as I saw it as removing a barrier to Resurrection skepticism. I no longer hold this view, partly because the Shroud persuades me that it was a real historical event. As for what Resurrection is or was, we only have the NT accounts, supplemented by various orthodox Christian writers, to be read with proper judgment, and an authoritative teaching church. I cite Paul from memory: “If Christ be not risen from the dead, then our faith is in vain!”\n\n","date":"May 7, 2013 at 8:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is certain that Jesus was not an Essene. The sect observed a form of ritual purity even more extreme than the Pharisees which is completely at odds with the teachings of Jesus in the gospels.  However, it is possible that the group of Jesus and his followers may have observed the Essene calendar which was more ancient than then commonly observed. We might speculate whether the Essene calendar still prevailed in Galilee. Scholars have attempted various explanations for the disconnect between the Synoptics and Johannine gospels on this point. \nThe Paschal lamb sacrifice was associated only with the first night of the Exodus and after that only upon the entry into the Promised Land and while both Solomon’s Temple and the Second Temple still functioned. It would not have been observed during the Babylonian Exile. It was discontinued with the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD. It is now only practised by Samaritans on Mount Gerizim. The Jewish Seder meal now only includes a lamb’s shank bone in memory of those times. A Jewish group in recent times sought to resume the sacrifice on Temple Mount but the authorities rejected the proposal as being too provocative. \nAs the requirement for a paschal lamb involved temple sacrifice, a conventional paschal lamb would not have been available at the Last Supper if John’s account that the crucifixion occurred on Preparation Day is accepted. We may conjecture that the early Christians, including the evangelists may have read back into the Last Supper (a farewell meal) the meaning of a Passover meal with Jesus as the symbolic Paschal Lamb, and with the Passover observance so imminent. In many respects, such as the timing of the crucifixion when the lambs were to be sacrificed, this symbolism is singularly appropriate.  \nJohn P Meier addresses the issue in his “Marginal Jew”. The following is an extract from my notes:\n“Although all evangelists agree that the crucifixion occurred on a Friday, John’s gospel asserts that this was also Preparation Day (Jn 19:31) making the Sabbath (Saturday) the day of Passover, a Sabbath of special solemnity therefore, and the reason why the bodies could not remain on their crosses.”\n“The synoptics on the other hand seem to envisage that the Last Supper was intended as the meal for Jesus and his disciples to observe their Passover.  Scholars have attempted assorted solutions to resolve this problem.  These have included assertions that there were various practices within Jewry, including one claiming that the meal actually occurred on a Tuesday thus allowing more time for the subsequent events to unfold, or that the synoptic verses connecting the meal to Passover were late stage insertions.  Meier opts for John’s statement that Friday was in fact Preparation Day, making the year either 30 or 33 AD.  Possibly the first Christians saw the Last Supper, with its institution of the Eucharist, as supplanting the Passover rites, and therefore ascribed it a comparable status in the synoptics.” (Meier finanally adopts Thursday, April 6, 30 AD for the evening of the Last Supper)\n\n","date":"May 9, 2013 at 5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"An important frequently overlooked question: “Why is the image that of an uncorrupted body, why are there no smears or tears in the cloth from removal of the body from its sticky surroundings, and where is the body that goes with this burial cloth??” There is only one reasonable answer!\n\n","date":"May 6, 2013 at 6:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I would concur with one prelate’s expressed view that Pope Benedict’s comparison with the Essene practice of not sacrificing animals was merely an intellectual musing of no particular significance. I think he was merely drawing attention to the Christian view that Jesus was the true Paschal lamb. \nWhereas the synoptics set out to establish the meal as an observance of Passover, John 13:1 deliberately states that it was before the festival of Passover, and then at Jn 13:2 introduces the farewell meal merely by saying “They were at supper …” with no indication that this is intended as a Passover meal. Not even the institution of the eucharist is mentioned, but is only foretold by the discourse on the “Bread of Life” back in chapter 6.  The long discourses in John’s account of the Last Supper cover new and other material entirely, quite distinct from that in the synoptics. \nI think it is a fair bet, that the symbolism of Jesus as the Paschal Lamb was read back into the compilation of the proto-synoptics, so that the farewell meal was then given the status of the disciples’ Passover meal. \nHowever, the Dead Sea scrolls reveal that a community following a solar calendar observed the Passover on a Tuesday, and it is credible that the disciples may also have done this. In that case the synoptics have compressed a juridical process that may have taken a few days into a few hours.  The difficulty of reconciling the synoptics with John’s account will now be apparent.\n\n","date":"May 9, 2013 at 7:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“the truth claims of Christianity neither rise nor fall on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin”.

Much of early religious beliefs which still survive originated in Iran, which were in turn influenced by Hinduism.  Whereas much or our early science originated in Iraq – the Babylonians for instance developed an extremely sophisticated numbering system with a base 60 and it included a zero place holder, and this survived well into the 13th century and was even used by early European mathematicians. \nWhen we come to Saint Paul, his home city of Tarsus was a renown centre of Stoicism, so we can expect that Paul had been exposed to some Greco-Roman philosophy.  Extract from Encyc Brit:. “Once the basis of Paul’s thought in the context of Jewish concepts of his time is understood in the light of modern scholarship, uncompromising predestinarian views of some of Calvin’s followers can be seen to be an overly rigid interpretation of Paul’s meaning. Attempts to derive Paul’s ideas from Greek or Gnostic influences have been largely abandoned. Paul stands out more clearly as a Christian Jew, whose conversion experience convinced him that Christ was the universal Lord under God, the agent and leader of God’s kingdom. Paul thus maintained that through Christ every barrier is broken down: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:28)” \nHowever Paul had been trained as a Pharisee, and as the word indicates, this in turn had developed from the Persian Parsees,  \nThe pagan Iranian god Mithra, derives from the Hindu Mitra.  He was seen as the god of contract and agreement, was associated with the creation through the sacrifice of a bull, and this ritual survived even into the later Roman version of Mithraism.  With the development of Zorastrianism,in Persia (6th C BC), the Mithraic cult slowly went into decline, but with some residues surviving.  Zoroastrianism was essentially dualistic, and might be creditied with such development as angels, devils, ideas on the soul, and other aspects we can see in the later Wisdom literature.  The Greeks never accepted Mithraism because it was associated with their old Persian enemies.  However about 100 AD, it took some hold in Roman military circles, and became associated with emperor worship. \nThe Jewish exiles in Babylon from the 6th C BC, were exposed to much of their thought, and it influenced redactions of the scriptures.  For example Ch 1 of Genesis was written as a consequence of exposure to Babylonian science, and supplemented the anthromorphic Jawhisitic account which was relegated to chapter 2, and they also took the Babylonian flood stories and gave them a divine meaning through adding to their earlier stories of Noah. \nFrom about 200 BC, many of the released exiles settled in Alexandria, a major centre of scholarship with their massive library, whence we have the Septuagint additions.  Jews here were no doubt influenced by Egyptian funerary rites, and also by Greek Platonism,  The origins of a resurrection theology, and the concepts of the soul were likely influenced by these.    \nWhat can we make of this syncretic approach to religion?  My own personal view of such matters is that not only did man pursue God in the distant past, but God also pursues man according to his divine plan.  I am much minded of Francis Thompson’s epic poem “The Hound of Heaven” in this pursuit.  \nMuch more could be written than what I have briefly sketched above, and a good text on Man’s Religions might elucidate more, but there is also much out there that is quite erroneous.  One needs to search out the more reputable accounts.\n\n","date":"October 4, 2012 at 7:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/29/blogger-please-dont-get-upset-if-your-catholic/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Blogger: Please don’t get upset if you are Catholic"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Iceangel71 makes the same error as those carbon dating the Shroud.

Granted that it is the only other sample available, there is a good reason for this in that it was the custom at the time to revisit the tombs after one year and to place the bones in an ossuary.  The only way that a proper induction can be made is for REPRESENTATIVE samples to be taken in accordance with standard scientific protocols, and to calculate the statistical significance of the results.  If one is to be scientific about it, the 95% Confidence Limits ascribed to the Carbon dating can only be ascribed to the single sample, and by no stretch of the imagination to the complete cloth.  The proper protocols in the case of the carbon dating were cavalierly set aside, consequently the said dating is worthless – even more so as it turns out the sample was very likely an invisible reweave patch, and not part of the original cloh at all. \nThere is a quaint irony in the Caiaphas family ossuary, in that Caiaphas was a Saducee who did not believe in the general resurrection of the body.  The ossuary custom arose in late Judaism because of the development of a resurrection doctrine among the Pharasaic sect from about 200 BC.  Did Caiaphas come to believe that there might be something in the doctrine after all?  There are apocryphal writings suggesting that he may have done.  Or was his family merely following the current social custom?  The ossuaries of Simon of Cyrene and his two sons have also been found.

Never mind! \nWhat I had written now appears under its own posting (I agree [x 3] Mostly!], but I don’t see Fr Dunk’s response there. It was certainly not intended to set off a debate on Argumentum ad Ignorantium, but as a brief summary of a few enigmatic properties, particularly the orthogonality of the image, which suggests to me some kind of vertically directed action.

Can Hugh or anyone else think of a cause for this? \nThe top of the head is in fact “represented”, as a vertical projection. If we are to insist on a “strictly scientific” approach, then accuracy in expressing ideas is essential. It is quite clear from the blood flows around the head, that the cap at least pretty well covered most of the head, if not indeed all of it. From the various ancient authors who give some details about particular crucifixions, none mention that any were so capped, but it is specifically mentioned in the case of Jesus, and the reason for it easily inferred. None of the others so capped, if indeed there were any, left behind any evidence of it. \nNevertheless I can find a point of agreement with Hugh, that there is little room for dogmatism if there are credible alternative different views about conclusions, but not so much if they rely entirely on idle speculations or fantasy.

I bet he’s never heard of the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Babylonian survivor of the Great Flood, Utnapishtim.  I don’t know that any rational person believes in the God that Krisetc doesn’t believe in.  “Faith without Rationality is Fanaticism” and maybe deserves lampooning!

It is not too difficult to imagine that when laying out a real body, that the shroud could easily become wrinkled, off-centre, and skewed; if the shroud was wrapped in any way around the body, then parts of the cloth would also no longer be symmetrical about the centre.  These effects may account for any apparent loss of symmetry in the image.  Off-topic: Mario shows the top of the sheet loosely draped at the top of the head.  Previous discussion has tended to conclude that the shroud was drawn firmly over the top of the head, because of head measurements between the facial and occiput images, even though there is no top-of-head image which requires another explanation (e.g. a head-cloth).   \nMy fundamental point is that it is not necessary to look for distortions in the body to account for any loss of symmetry.  It can be adequately explained by the actual disposition of the cloth that occurred during the burial rite.\n\n","date":"July 19, 2014 at 5:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/18/comment-promoted-a-misalignment-between-the-left-and-right-shoulders/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  A Misalignment Between the Left and Right Shoulders"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I love that picture of “The Fool” all decked out in his pretty best, complete with swag over his shoulder, (no doubt he’s remembered to bring his toothbrush).

British Medical journal ‘The Lancet’ and the London Times reviewed the findings as well-reasoned and scientific, and ‘Paris Figaro’ also voiced its support.\nHowever the Paris Acadamy was so dominated by ‘rationalists’ and ‘free-thinkers’ that the Academy refused to publish the full text of the lecture.\nIn his “final” letter to ‘Revue Scientifique’, Delage stated: “… I recognize Christ as a historical personage, and I see no reason why anyone should be scandalized that there still exist material traces of his earthly life.”\nIt is evident that scientific bodies and individual scientists are not immune from their own kind of rationalistic fanaticism, every bit as much as any evangelical Biblical literalist or jihadist.

He was born in 1918 and is now 95, and as far as I know aspires to be as reasonably active as any person can be at that age. He is widely regarded in NZ as the Grand Old Man of extremely radical Religious Studies.  Just Google on “Lloyd Geering” – the Wiki article is reasonably accurate, and you can see there that he enjoys several civil honours, including the Order of New Zealand and a knighthood.  He has been a remarkably prolific writer, the ‘Fishpond’ site listing several of his works. His radicalism outdistances the likes of Cupitt, Spong, Crossan et al by several miles. He has been a leading participant in the Jesus Seminar movement. Up until quite recently he was the principal pastor of ‘St Matthew’s on the Terrace’ in the central city, Wellington, a church formerly Presbyterian, but now given over to a ‘catch-all’ congregation. \nHe first came to public prominence in 1967, when as a Presbyterian minister, a conservative group in New Plymouth city charged him with heresy for denying the reality of the Resurrection, accusations of heresy being a not infrequent occurence in NZ Presbyterianism. The proceedings were extensively reported in the daily newspapers throughout NZ at the time, rather surprising in the officially secular state that NZ claims to be. He was eventually acquitted, but the extensive publicity had served him and his purposes well. It gave some impetus to the study of Religions in NZ universities. Unfortunately, part of his legacy will be to take NZ further down the road towards a national atheism, and a somewhat anti-religious bias, denying the founding missionary culture that has in fact formed much of our ethos.  \nI have attended a few of Lloyd Geering’s lectures, and spoken with him, as he has been in much demand as a speaker and ‘authority’ on religious matters generally.  The dichotomy in his professed atheism but continuing participation in religious affairs I find difficult to comprehend.  A now-deceased acquaintance close to the heresy trial had commented to me that he seemed to cut a somewhat pathetic figure. However such a personal view belies the extensive albeit negative influence he has had on the perception of religious matters in this country. Perhaps he is yet another example of how a negative reaction against a fundamentalist evangelical upbringing with its biblical literalism can swing to its opposite extreme.\n\n","date":"May 28, 2013 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/26/forced-by-the-evidence-to-jettison-long-held-assumptions-about-catholic-relics/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Forced by the evidence to jettison long-held assumptions about Catholic relics"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, I think you are mistaken in saying that Geering is not worth attention.

I surmise that the only reason why Crossan postulates that Jesus was scavenged by wild dogs, is that it was the common fate of many crucifixion victims.

The taking of bribes to allow the release of bodies was considered a severe moral offence. The four gospel accounts are more or less corroborative, so that Crossan’s grounds for dismissing them seem somewhat flimsy. \nI had not encountered Barbara Thiering previously, but she seems to out-Pagels Pagels. Jesus scholar Geza Vermes commented on her work:\n“Professor Barbara Thiering’s reinterpretation of the New Testament, in which the married, divorced, and remarried Jesus, father of four, becomes the “Wicked Priest” of the Dead Sea Scrolls, has made no impact on learned opinion. Scroll scholars and New Testament experts alike have found the basis of the new theory, Thiering’s use of the so-called “pesher technique”, without substance.”\nN T Wright has written:\n“It is safe to say that no serious scholar has given this elaborate and fantastic theory any credence whatsoever. It is nearly ten years since it was published; the scholarly world has been able to take a good look at it: and the results are totally negative.” \nThe author of Revelations of course allows that Satan will be allowed to roam but will ultimately be defeated Rev 20:10.\nI have often thought that the Book of Job was the closest that anyone ever came to resolving the problem of evil, why bad things happen to good people.

No authenticist can accept the C14 results as representing the true age of the Shroud, and there are several reasons for coming to the conclusion that it is indeed the burial cost of Christ and dates from that time.\n History attests that such an object did indeed exist, even well into Byzantine times, but it disappeared from Constantinople following Venetian and Frankish crusaders sacking the city of its gold and relics,  Several forensic pathologists have studied the present relic and have come to the conclusion that the image is that of a real crucified man who in addition suffered the gratuitous mockery punishment of a crown of thorns.  The stains on it are anthropoid blood and likely that of the victim.  There is only one known person who was capable of vacating his burial apparel leaving it intact.  There is much additional corroborative evidence.  So that the belief that the Shroud is authentic is not at all irrational. \nDavid Goulet makes the point “The fact we are even having this conversation is proof that the sampling was flawed” and that is a valid point.  As Sampath states, the sampling was not composite and breached the original sampling protocols designed by Chagas, himself a skeptic as to authenticity, but which would satisfy correct scientific sampling criteria.  In the face of this breach, it is not incumbent upon authenticists to demonstrate heterogeneity of the Shroud to make their case, but it is incumbent upon the C-14 protagonists to demonstrate their case that it is homogeneous.  This can only done by composite sampling, and to date that assertion  rests only on unaided visual inspection, while many questions persist casting doubt on the sample taken, notwithstanding Hugh Farey’s uncritical and unscientific protests of the validity of these highly dubious results.  \nThe alternative that the authentic burial cloth of Christ should somehow miraculously appear as originating in the 14th century by some strange supernatural agency, is I suppose barely possible, but seems to be the stuff of fairyland (oral pun is unintentional).\n\n","date":"November 14, 2014 at 9:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"erratum, para 1, “… burial ‘cloth’ of Christ …”\n\n","date":"November 14, 2014 at 9:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Emmett you can very quickly bring up the biblical text you want to check, if you have some idea of whereabouts the text is.

And although a grounding in statistics and probability theory had been part of the course I was still not satisfied.  I obtained my first formal qualification in Statistics and Probability the following year in 1963, the two set text books being by A H Mood of the RAND Corporation, and P G Hoel of the University of California, both classics of their type.  That a great-uncle had founded the Statistics department at the University of Melbourne and authored text books on the subject some decades earlier is purely incidental. \nIn the ensuing years I built on this foundation, developing skills in quality control, inspection systems, queuing theory, accident analysis, flood predictions, earthquake engineering, hazards analysis, projects evaluation, along with many others.  In all of them, statistics and probability theory were often a significant part of the analysis.  I learnt about Operations Research, Game Theory, Monte Carlo Simulation, Reliability Theory, Markov Chains, Probability Generating Functions, and various other arcane techniques.  Towards the end of my career, I had been designing sampling systems for various Audit groups, and providing the needed assurances on various capital projects with inherently uncertain outcomes.  I had meantime added to my statistics library including advanced works by William Feller of Princeton, and Sheldon M Ross of Berkeley, among various others.  \nIt is now nearly 15 years since I retired from all that, and with advancing years, I have probably now forgotten some of the more esoteric techniques.  I can still manage a Monte Carlo simulation, but a Markov Chain might be more of a challenge.  It remains a rapidly advancing discipline and doubtless new techniques have also since come to light.  I can however still remember the fundamental principles.  \nA quote from my first text book by P G Hoel, in his Chapter 12 on Statistical Design in Experiments seems apposite: \n“It is a common experience for experimenters who are unacquainted with statistical principles to seek statistical assistance when their experiments fail to produce the results anticipated by them.  In some experiments the data were obtained in such a manner as to exclude any valid conclusions of the type desired; in others there is little that can be done to extract further information from the data because the experiment was not designed with a statistical analysis in mind.  Only rarely are the experiments that give valid conclusions as sensitive as they would have been if a standard statistical design had been employed.  Too many experimenters do not seem to appreciate the obvious injunction that the time to design an experiment is before the experiment is begun.” \nHoel goes on to give a few simple elementary illustrations including the design of a simple agricultural experiment.  Mood makes much the same observations in his Chapter 7 on Sampling, only in different words.  It is evident that homogeneity cannot be assumed in any experiment, but that heterogeneity is to be expected, and is indeed the normal situation. \nNothing statistically significant can be said about the results from a single sample.  Certainly the record shows that contrary to Hoel’s injunction, the participants in the 1988 radiocarbon C14 sampling of the Shroud had not appreciated that the time to design an experiment was before it had begun.  The foreplay had been acrimonious, the debates as to the sampling site prolonged, and the concern for conservation overplayed.  It is ironic that even when this single sample had been divided among the three laboratories, there were variations such that a statistical trend across the sample became evident, suggesting the likelihood of heterogeneity.  \nIt remains a blight on the history of science that such eminent laboratories agreed to such an approach.  Why did they do it?  Answer, Because they had so much to gain in reputation by demonstrating their new technique, and contrariwise so much to lose if they had abdicated. \nThe 1988 C14 result is statistically meaningless.\n\n","date":"November 16, 2014 at 4:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Tell it to Paul G Hoel & Alexander McFarlane Mood!\n\n","date":"November 16, 2014 at 5:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"HF: “However, as anybody who has followed this site for any length of time knows, both the historical and scientific evidence for authenticity is hotly disputed even among authenticists.” \nAnd ‘as anybody who has followed this site for any length of time knows,’ the only historical and scientific evidence that is hotly disputed among authenticists, are matters of finer detail.  Zugbibe disputed the finer details of Barbet’s analysis, but despite this he displayed no illusions that the cloth was that of a real crucified male, nor did he debate whether or not the evidence of the crown of thorns was faulty.  Other forensic pathologists took a similar line.  Even though he is not a professional palinologist, Hugh himself vigorously attacked the question of pollens, despite the fact that professional palinologists had asserted that there were pollen residues exclusive to Palestine, and even so, Hugh himself was unable to exclude them completely. \nDaniel Scavone has provided not merely one historical reference for evidence that the burial cloth was in Constantinople, but several references.  It is true that some authenticist historians dispute whether all such references refer to the Shroud, but some at least seem to be clearly specific, particularly if those that might refer to the Mandylion are excluded.  The cumulative effect of the record makes a strong case that it was indeed there. \nHugh’s response does not deal adequately with the question concerning homogeneity, which at present can only be based on unaided visual inspection, and he continues to imply fallaciously that it is the authenticists’ responsibility to demonstrate heterogeneity despite the opportunity for composite sampling to prove his case being abandoned, because of an unproven inference.  \nFurthermore, no one yet can explain how the image of a real crucified male that persuades pathologists of its organic origin, came to be expressed on the cloth.

Their statistical training is typically only ever superficial.  It is manifest in the laboratories claiming of a 95% confidence limit in their test results which is clearly incorrect and could only apply to the individual sample piece.  The claim that it applies to the entire cloth rests on an unsupported supposition that the sample was representative. \nI regret to say that it is also apparent enough in the responses given here by a trained scientist.  It was also apparent in the uncomprehending responses of scientist Professor Luigi Gonella to the searching queries raised by archaeologist William Meacham who exceptionally seems to have been fully aware of the need for properly representative sampling.   \nI make few additional claims to my own competence in these matters that are not also shared by any other professional properly trained in the disciplines of statistical mathematics and probability theory.  I became passionate about the subject and made the effort to attain that competence.  There may be other engineers or scientists who have made similar efforts.  I may even have met one or two but not many. \nThe paper “Chronological History of the Evidence for the Anomalous Nature of the C-14 Sample Area of the Shroud of Turin” by Joseph G. Marino and Edwin J. Prior 2008, is enlightening.  The first 45 points of evidence in that paper give the reasons why the authors consider the sample to have been anomalous, which happens to by own view of the matter.  However, not all will agree with that opinion and for the present we may set those aside.\nIn an Appendix they provide a further 32 points of evidence.  These were to address important points of the C-14 process, specifically: “a) the need to exercise caution in giving too much importance to it as an individual test; b) the method’s limitations; and c) the need to place the test in a multi-disciplinary context. The C-14 aspects also give important historical background information leading up to the 1988 testing.”   \nIn an editorial footnote, they refer to a subsequent Addendum to the paper, which lists yet a further 26 points of evidence.  Much of the Addendum is taken up with Meacham’s objections from his book passionately entitled, “The Rape of the Turin Shroud: How Christianity’s most precious relic was wrongly condemned and violated.”  \nThe Marino – Prior paper and its Addendum can be read at:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/chronology.pdf\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/addendum.pdf   \nIf correspondents read nothing else about this matter, then they should at least read the Addendum, so they may be adequately informed about these issues.\n\n","date":"November 16, 2014 at 10:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/14/god-in-his-lab/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"God in his lab"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If you are unable to come to your own decisions, you have the option of weighing the arguments as such or putting your faith in a person.

Much of the above discussion is of the Either – Or variety.  I suggest that it may be so complex, that we do not really know what can be excluded, and that it requires some combination of causes.  They may include chemical, physical, internal, external, particulate or radiation or various combinations. \nIf amines are involved, there may be a clue in the imaging cut-off distance of about 4 cm.  Hugh has made the point that cadaverine and putrescine will rapidly permeate over a large area even beyond his laboratory doors.  If they were directly involved in the process, we would expect there to be a much larger cut-off distance in the imaging process, so perhaps as Max says, they are a red herring.  Perhaps it is in a short-lived precursor, such as lysine, or some other amine-like chemical.  Bodily chemicals which may become available at time of death are several, complex, and they interact.  Until an effort of concentrated study is made by those competent in this field of chemistry, to set out what the credible options might be, I feel so much of any discussion on the topic will remain as useless speculation. \nIf Colin Berry had had a less agenda-driven experimental programme, than attempting to demonstrate how an entirely fictitious artisan could forge the image, than in discovering how  such an image might have occurred by a naturalistic means, then all his work might have had results rather more intriguing than otherwise.

You do not indicate whether the option you favour is a miraculous occurrence, or that by the hand of an artisan. \nThe orthogonal presentation of the image is I believe a particular problem for some assumptions for the arrangements of the cloth.  I have difficulty with a tightly wrapped body, which I would expect to show images of the sides, as well as a distorted widening of the image.  \nFor orthogonality to occur with no images of the sides, I think we would have to expect that at the time of image formation, both the ventral and dorsal aspects of the cloth would need to be fairly close to being planar, such as might occur with a photographic plate.    \nI see at least two possible ways that this might occur.  John’s gospel asserts that Nicodemus brought some 100 pounds (Roman) of myrrh and aloes (a lot).  In addition the burial occurred in a garden during the spring, when there would be ample foliage and flora at hand.  If the sides of the body were packed with the myrrh, aloes, foliage etc before being tightly wrapped, then both the front and back of the cloth might be just sufficiently planar to present an orthogonal image, and also conceal the sides of the body.  Such packing of the body might also allow later family visits to be relatively free from the stench of putrefaction.\nAlternatively, as the time was getting close to evening when a Great Sabbath would commence at about 6:00 pm, then the work of burial may have been cursory only, with the intention to complete it after the Sabbath.  In that case the cloth may have been loosely draped under and over the body, which may have allowed orthogonality.  Clearly also, the burial party would have disposed in some way of Nicodemus’ package, it is interesting that it is deliberately mentioned by John. \nFinally I suggest you refer to Mario Latendresse’s paper where he endeavours to demonstrate how the image might be satisfactorily explained using a live model:\n“The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened Before the Images Formed and no Major Image Distortions Necessarily Occur from a Real Body” Mario Latendresse, Ph.D\nThe full paper can be read at: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.160.656\nYou may prefer merely to check his slide show, which is self-explanatory:\nhttp://www.sindonology.org/papers/latendresse2005aSlides.pdf   \nI am not entirely happy with a miraculous explanation, as in that case I would expect a greater degree of perfection and total absence of any distortion, and even greater clarity.  Whatever caused the image, I believe could only occur under a remarkable and rare combination of physical, biological and environmental circumstances.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2015 at 7:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max’s scenario of a tightly wrapped cloth cannot have produced the orthogonal image we see on the Shroud without a miracle having occurred.  His hypothetical explanation of a wetted cloth that stretches and then shrinks back to its original shape won’t do the job without distortion occurring,  Even if the particulates that formed the image were somehow constrained to act solely in the vertical direction, there would still be distortion, and the sides of the body would also be imaged, but they are not.  The Latendresse model is the cloth disposition that would allow orthogonality of the image. \nI am sympathetic to Yannick’s hypothesis that the image may have formed by some unknown natural means, because of some exceptional circumstances concerning the burial, such as its environment in the tomb, and the use of myrrh, aloes and other herbs and flora.  David Hines experiments in this field seem intriguing, and possibly promising.  The occurrence of an earthquake with its after-shocks, release of radon gas, and the concurrent variations in the geo-electro-magnetic fields might also have been a necessary factor, for all we know. \nAs other correspondents have mentioned, the integrity of the blood clots seem to exclude the deliberate removal of the body by persons unknown.  Although very few other cases of imaging of corpses are known, it would be unusual to inspect shroud wrappings of a corpse after three days to see if any imaging had in fact occurred.  Any subsequent unwrapping after three days, then any imaging may have been blotted by putrefaction effects.  I suggest it would be pointless to examine the modern wrappings of corpses, as the circumstances of Jesus’ burial would not be fully replicated.  Some time ago, Hugh F had proposed carrying out experiments on frozen mice to see if imaging occurred, but I’m unaware that he’s made any progress with this intention, apart from gathering the necessary materials.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2015 at 4:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/08/guest-posting-by-yannick-clment/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Guest Posting by Yannick Clément"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Response to Hugh:  I see the debate as relevant because it has been argued that placing coins on the eyes is confined to pagan or Hellenistic burials, NEVER to orthodox Jews, and therefore the images of coins CANNOT be on the Shroud, as this is alleged as being an orthodox Jewish burial.  There are obvious errors in that argument.  \nWay back on Oct 5, 11:05 am, O.K. provided a reputable source saying that it was an Orthodox practice, and gave an explanation for it, whether or not the source is accepted, or perhaps rejected because it did not suit David Mo’s point of view.  Max has provided a number of Jewish examples where coins have been found in skulls, or in ossuaries, or in sarcophagi, and this is at least suggestive that the practice was at least sporadic if not more frequent.  The fact that not all cases were found on the eye sockets is easily disposed of because afterwards the bones were placed in ossuaries and there was then no point in replacing the coins on the eye sockets.   Furthermore, members of Jesus’ burial party may have been influenced by Hellenist customs.  \nI agree that the Domenico counterexample of there being very few shrouds found in Jewish burials is not relevant, for the simple reason that it was more common at that time for the bones to be placed in ossuaries, and it would seem that any remnants of burial shrouds or other burial garments would have then been normally disposed of, possibly burnt.  The TS survived only because its occupant vacated it, presumably due to his resurrection, and it remained intact.  \nTherefore the question of images of coins on eyes remains a viable hypothesis.  Max and some others claim that they have discerned such images, while others do not.  Note that Giovanna De Liso in her seismic experiments obtained an image of a metallic object (a key), so that apparently an image causing object does not need to be organic.  I think that’s about as far as the debate may take us.  The images of coins on eyes remains as a possibility and can only be denied if it can be conclusively shown that the images do not in fact exist.

The argument is therefore more than merely academic, but its resolution in favour of the images being present would be decisive in resolving this issue.  \n2)  The question of the coins bearing an image and therefore not appropriate for Jewish burials or other use, will not hold water.  The census tax of one denarius, clearly has an image of Caesar (Mt 22, Mk 12, Lk 20), the Pharisees can readily procure one when asked to be shown it, so that the coins were clearly in common use.

We do not know how literally this was followed, or if it is a gloss.  Were the customs followed to the letter, or just in a general way, or at all?  We do not really know.\nSecond: Spices of 100 Roman pounds is a large sack of potatoes, about 40 kg.  Obviously something was done with it.

This work is a major classic in anthropology and is often cited;  I came across it during my course in Religious Studies. \nAlthough the evolutionary sequence of magical, religious, and scientific thought is no longer accepted and Frazer’s broad general psychological theory has proved unsatisfactory, his work enabled him to synthesize and compare a wider range of information about religious and magical practices than has been achieved subsequently by any other single anthropologist. \nIn making a vast range of primitive custom appear intelligible to European thinkers of his time, Frazer had a wide influence among men of letters; and, though he traveled little himself, he was in close contact with missionaries and administrators who provided information for him and valued his interpretation of it. His other works include Totemism and Exogamy (1910) and Folk-Lore in the Old Testament (1918). He was knighted in 1914. \nIf Frazer claimed that the practice of placing coins or potsherds over the eyes of deceased Jews. then it is almost certainly correct.  Note that the ref provided by O.K. gives an explanation of the practice unconnected with Charon and the Styx: “… the intention being to keep deceased from seeing the way by which he was carried to his last home …”  Whatever, the practice may very well derive from a more ancient custom which may have had other connotations.  Coins found in the mouths of some skulls, may very well have dropped through from the eye sockets.  Images of coins on eyes of the TSM may well be back on the agenda.\n\n","date":"October 5, 2014 at 3:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, you wrote at Reminder 2: ““As early as 1994, I myself thought there was a cloth laid on top of head too.

There had to be some explanation as to why there was no ‘top-of-head’ image.  Measurements on Shroudscope showed there was a distance of some 35 cm between the tip of the nose on the ventral image and the likely position of the back-of-head occiput bump on the dorsal image.  This seemed to imply that the cloth was drawn firmly, even tightly, over the top of the head leaving virtually no room for an air gap.  The general conclusion, with some dissenters, was that there had to be some object such as a cloth or cap masking the main cloth from the top of the head.  Your flowers might do it.

However the confusion giving rise to my perhaps uncharitable derision is I think evident in several of the comments which you yourself felt obliged to rebut, and very well too. The main problem I see with a certain type of too prevalent Protestant fundamentalism, is not so much because of its claims to be based on scripture alone, so much, as to how the same scripture is read and interpreted, and how it is perceived. It seems to me that rationality and critical thinking are relegated to a distant second or even third place, while personal perspectives mask the Truth of the text with claims of being guided or inspired by the Holy Spirit. There is a word for this and it is called “fanatacism”. Of such was the Tower of Babel built! I doubt if your readers could comprehend the concept that the Shroud might well be the “love-letter” from Jesus written to be fully understood only in the modern era with our technology and science, as it is not referred to directly in the New Testament. But the early Christians had to be discreet in the face of persecution, they did not cast “pearls before swine”, they knew how to keep their most precious secrets, and only oblique references will be found. For example, what reading might one make of Revelations 19:12-14 with its reference to the rider called Faithful and True on a white charger with a cloak soaked in blood and an army of heaven dressed in linen of dazzling white?

Check the dorsal image of the head, there is a pigtail which appears to have some kind of oily dressing on it. The TSM has long hair. It is only the biblical literalists such as those in the “Church of God” who want to insist that Jesus had short hair. They misread scripture. Paul (brought up in Tarsus in Cilicia, and who never met Jesus in mortal life) tells the Greek Corinithians (not the Jewish Christians) to ask themselves whether nature itself does not tell them that long hair on a man is nothing to be admired (I Cor 11:14). Clearly the fashion in 1st century Corinth, and indeed throughout much of the Roman Empire was for short hair. Paul would not want his Greek converts to make themselves targets of mockery on the specious gounds of not complying with such trivial local customs. A blogger claimed there was a verse in Peter, I couldn’t find it; I think he confused Paul with Peter. A more interesting claim concerned the Arch of Titus erected in 81 AD in the Sacra Via in Rome celebrating Titus’ pillage of the Temple in Jerusalem. A frieze shows the victorious army carrying off the menorah and other temple spoils. It is claimed that the figures have short hair. Artistic licence and ignorance aside, it is not at all clear to me whether any short-haired figures depicted are Jewish captives or Roman soldiery. It seemed to me that some of the figures were certainly bearded and had hair of a reasonable length that could be called long. Someone more knowledgable may be able to comment with better authority than I can. Search on “Arch of Titus images”. \nClaims that Jesus had short hair seem to be based on no more than an anti-Catholic bias against classical depictions of Christ, and tenuous arguments are found to support such spurious claims. \nThe standard depiction of a bearded Christ seems to have commenced with the icons of the 6th century, and it seems very likely that the Image of Edessa (whatever that might have been – some speculate that it may have been the facial image of the Shroud) was the template for those icons. There may even be an earlier depiction, as an early mosaic found at Urfa also shows the same image with long hair and beard. \nA search on “Jewish rabbi images” will all show them with long hair and beards, particularly the ultra-orthodox, who clearly seek to follow what they believe to be the proper biblical traditions. \nIt is known that Moses’ brother Aaron had a beard so that it became included in a blessing, the nazirite under a vow was obliged not to cut his hair, the One on the throne is described as with hair like wool.

We know a great deal about how the pyramids were likely made.  At present everything about the forming of the Shroud image is sheer speculation.  \nVery likely the pyramids were built with the assistance of earth ramps, and you might be aware that Egypt has no shortage of sand, a particularly tractable material.  We know a great deal about Egyptian mathematics, particularly from the Rhind papyrus, 17th century BC copy of a text 2 centuries older still, and also from the Golenishchev Papyrus (in the Moscow Museum of Fine Arts), dating from the 19th century BC.  \nThe blocks would be easily sledded up the ramps on timber rails using milk and fat for lubrication.  That such ramps were built is evident from a satirical problem set out in the Rhind papyrus. a satirical letter in which one scribe, Hori, taunts his rival, Amen-em-opet, for his incompetence as an adviser and manager. “You are the clever scribe at the head of the troops,” Hori chides at one point; “a ramp is to be built,  730 cubits long, 55 cubits wide, with 120 compartments–it is 60 cubits high, 30 cubits in the middle . . . and the generals and the scribes turn to you and say, ‘You are a clever scribe, your name is famous. Is there anything you don’t know? Answer us, how many bricks are needed?’ Let each compartment be 30 cubits by 7 cubits.”  There are three other problems like it in the same letter.  Further information is needed, but the point of the humour is clear enough as Hori sets these difficult but typical tasks. \nThe Egyptians did not seem to know Pythagorean triples (the Babylonians did), but were able to set out exact right angles, and it is evident that they originated surveying with resetting of land boundaries following the annual NIlitic floods.  They had an adequate numbering system, were familiar with binary fractions, and were capable of calculating areas and volumes, even of pyramids.   \nYou will have to find another enigma to make an adequate point on divine intervention, but don’t bother with citing Stonehenge!\n\n","date":"July 12, 2015 at 5:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/11/ignorance-with-wings/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Ignorance with Wings"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"On Colin’s site I can see that individual fibres are coloured, adjacent to uncoloured fibres, and some fibres are only partially coloured along their length.  I did not see any examples where only the PCWs were coloured, but the medullas of such fibres were uncoloured.  It is my understanding that a common claim made for Shroud fibres is that the superficiality of the colouring is such that it is confined to the outer surface of the fibres only, specifically the crowns;  alternatively it is confined to an impurity layer of starches on the fibre surface.  The figure of 200 nm, sometimes up to perhaps 500 nm, is sometimes quoted as the upper limit of the thickness of the colouring.  Raymond Rogers claimed to have removed the colouring from a fibre which left the underlying fibre intact and otherwise unaffected, which seemed to persuade him that the colouring resided on the impurity layer.  Surely this is what is meant when superficiality is claimed for the colouring.  I can applaud Colin’s attempts and industrious efforts at his experimentations.  But I do not see that he can yet claim that the colouring has a comparable superficiality to that of the Shroud fibres.  Surely for his claims that the scorching model is valid, he has to demonstrate that the colouring is confined to no more than the primary cell wall of the fibres, leaving the medullas unaffected.

The carpet was found in the grave of a Scythian prince. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC. This carpet is 283 by 200 cm (approximately 9.3 by 6.5 ft) and has 36 symmetrical knots per cm² (232 per inch²).

Its central field is a deep red color and it has two wide borders, one depicting deer and the other horsemen.” \nOf particular significance is “… The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving”.

And why does it contradict a number of artistic and historical traditions?” \nThere is only one man who had the capability, imagination and resources to create it.  He is unique.  Roger Bacon b. ~1220 England, d. 1292 guess where, Oxford!! His career is worth the effort of researching by anyone interested in investigating a possible medieval provenance of the Shroud.  The only problem is that Bacon was an extremely busy chappie, very likely he would have left some record of his efforts, and he was probably engaged on so many other projects, he would not have had the time to dedicate to it. \nOrdered by his Franciscan superiors to desist from his researches, and counter-commanded  by Pope Clement IV to send him his researches under secrecy, he prepared and dispatched three massive volumes.  Unfortunately the death of Clement in 1268 extinguished Bacon’s dreams of gaining for the sciences their rightful place in the curriculum of university studies.  He was Aristotelian in his outlook rather than Platonist.  He extolled experimentation so ardently that he has often been viewed as a harbinger of modern science more than 300 years before it came to bloom.  \nBacon had a sort of laboratory for alchemical experiments and carried out some systematic observations with lenses and mirrors. His studies on the nature of light and on the rainbow are especially noteworthy, and he seems to have planned and interpreted these experiments carefully. But his most notable “experiments” seem never to have been actually performed; they were merely described. He suggested, for example, that a balloon of thin copper sheet be made and filled with “liquid fire”; he felt that it would float in the air as many light objects do in water. He seriously studied the problem of flying in a machine with flapping wings. He was the first person in the West to give exact directions for making gunpowder (1242); and, though he knew that, if confined, it would have great power and might be useful in war, he failed to speculate further. (Its use in guns arose early in the following century.) Bacon described spectacles (which also soon came into use); elucidated the principles of reflection, refraction, and spherical aberration; and proposed mechanically propelled ships and carriages.

He paints the following scenario. \nOveruse of farmland resulted in crop failures and the previous Barrow Culture was abandoned about 3200 BC.  It was succeeded by a stone circle culture spreading right across Europe from about 3000 BC, commencing with “wood-henges”, then stone from about 2700 BC, with joints and dressings imitative of wood-work.  Purpose not strictly known but includes: Elite burial sites, Community & Trade centres, Religious activities, Military purposes.   Cosmology significance include astronomical alignments, and important “ley-lines”.  Bones of some 50 or so cremated bodies were discovered. \nPalmer asserts that about 2100 BC some 80 bluestone pillars, each weighing 4 TONS (NOT 40 TONS) originating in the Preseli Hills, were used to build two incomplete concentric circles.  The method of transport although presently unknown for certain cannot be classified as a “mystery” in the same sense as is the enigmatic Shroud image.  There are two fundamental theories.  One is that they had already been transported there by a glacial ice sheet.  The alternative that they were transported by sea, and then manhandled overland to the site would be well within neolithic human endeavour (Note they were 4 tons each not 40 tons). \nAbout 2000 BC, the lintel circle and horseshoe of sarsen stones were constructed, originally some 30 uprights (only 17 survive) each of about 50 TONS, brought from some 30 KM away.  This remodelling reduced the importance of other stone circles within about 240 km. Other works at Stonehenge followed including the unfinished avenue to the Avon River.  \nIn 1150 BC, the ash from an Icelandic volcano eruption blocked out the sun from N. Europe, killing vegetation, trees and crops, and the Stone Circle was then abandoned.  Their gods had failed them!  In Britain there were no known monuments nor ceremonial burials 1100 – 600 BC.  From 500 BC, Celtic ideas surfaced, religion focused on springs and wells, emanating from the Mesopotamian Ainu cult. \nThe construction of the Egyptian pyramids remained a mystery until their solution was discovered.  Earth (sand?) ramps were built to the placement locations and the stones hauled into place by sled using manpower.  Whether timber rollers on timber rails were used has been discussed, or whether milk was used as a lubricant.

Both are applied sciences reliant on the research of specialists in the pure sciences.  Both involve human risk and safety, medicine in a direct personal way, the engineer in a more vicarious way involving the general public.  The physician may bury his mistakes; the engineer is more likely to leave monuments to his.\nThe physician depends on advances and pure research in organic chemistry and in the subtleties of human biology.  However ultimately the acceptance of new drugs will still depend on the empirical results of blind testing, along with its margins of error, confidence limits, and singular exceptions.  Except perhaps in such cases as electronics, manufactured materials, simple structural analysis and the direct application of mathematics, the engineer is very much more dependent on empiricism, having to deal with the uncertainties in the forces and materials of mother nature.  Yet he must find workable solutions.\nThe hydraulics engineer for example would love to have a solution of the Navier-Stokes equation of fluid flow, one of 23 problems nominated by David Hilbert in 1900 for 20th century mathematicians to solve.  Along with the Riemann hypothesis, it remains as yet intractable.  Hilbert’s #1 problem, Cantor’s cardinality of the continuum, appears to be in a class of Godel’s undecidable problems.  Clearly there are limits to the pure science approach that not even mathematics can resolve.\nDuring my career, I was frequently involved in the resolution of contractual disputes, frequently attending seminars on formal arbitration and the role of the expert witness, to assist me in this.  It was evident that equally competent experts were quite capable of arguing contrary cases supporting either side.  They had their roles to play, but it left me with few illusions that any expert should have the last word on any matter of moment.  For that, I shall put my trust in what appears to me to be the more reasonable conclusion.\nIt is an error of human judgment to place one’s absolute faith in scientism.  It has its practical value, but it also has its limitations.  Yesterday’s scientific dogma is tomorrow’s scientific heresy.  One need only mention the controversies of the dual nature of light, particulate or wave-like, Newton’s laws of motion superseded by Einstein’s theory of relativity, the successive and contradictory theories in quantum mechanics.  And as yet, there is still no Grand Unified Theory.  We are Lilliputians only capable of simple small-scale stuff.\nIn the grander scheme of things, we may need to have recourse to empiricism, what in fact appears to us to be reasonable, hopefully illuminated by any divine spark resident within the human psyche.  We may seek the truth, and occasionally we may even attain it.  But to err, is still to remain human.\n\n","date":"December 1, 2013 at 6:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/30/it-may-not-suit-the-scientific-mind-set/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"It may not suit the scientific mind-set"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A favourite ploy by some Catholic conservatives is to accuse Teilhard of pantheism.

To claim that the shroud matches any of them is mere speculation.”\nIan Wilson’s 2010 “The Shroud” fig 9c (facing p.146 in my copy) clearly shows a Roman coin c.100 BC, with a gladiator using a flagrum in a contest, with a branching lash giving four thongs at its ends. The scale of the coin is too small to show the plumbata, which might or might not have been incorporated for purposes of gladiatorial combat, as distinct from legally inflicted punishment by scourging.

I respectfully suggest he may like to refresh his youthful memory, by reference to Ch 4. “The Preliminary Sufferings”, p.92 of the 1963 Image edition. \nThe Roman coin I mentioned at #58 above had four lashes to its flagrum, Ian Wilson’s reconstruction has three lashes; William Smith apparently has other versions, so that clearly flagra were constructed as personal weapons, their design being merely limited according to the morbid imagination of their owners.  HF claims that Wilson’s flagrum was designed merely to fit the case of the TS, but this is in fact not so, if he would reread Barbet.  \nBarbet asserts that all these wounds have the SAME shape (difficult with only a blood-soaked sponge), he likens them to a halter some 3cm long, the two circles representing balls of lead, the line joining them being the mark of the thong.  They occur in PAIRS of TWO (not three) parallel wounds, and he deduces that each flagrum had TWO thongs, laid out in the form of a fan, the centre being the executioner’s hand. On the thorax they are oblique, horizontal on the loins, and oblique once more on the legs. He comments that on the FRONTAL image, there are long oblique furrows which must have been produced by the ends of the thongs. Having struck the calves of the legs with their leaden balls, they have turned around the outer edge of the leg and lashed the front with their points (a skill easily acquired by a sadistic executioner). Barbet has previously commented from his knowledge of the classics, that scourging commonly occurred with the prisoner facing the pillar to which he was bound, with his arms being bound above his head. There are no scourge marks on the arms!\nBarbet deduces that there must have been two executioners, likely of different heights, for the obliqueness differs on each side. He finally notes that painters have been content at most, with vague formless excoriations, and none have ever attempted such minute details.\nHowever if we are to follow the logic of Hugh Farey’s argument, then not only does the TS also have all its other highly unlikely properties devised by his entirely notional forger, but this genius also had the perspicacity to paint the image with identical scourge marks, apparently radiating from the hands of two executioners of different heights, either side of the prisoner, but with no marks on the arms.  I wonder if Hugh has ever heard of Occam’s razor, for there is a simpler solution than the one he has to devise, and that is that the TS is in fact what it appears to be! \nBarbet was of course an experienced forensic pathologist, who experimented with cadavers and amputee’s limbs, and was also extremely knowledgeable in the Greek and Roman classics.  I am unaware of any credentials he may have had in teaching science at a boys’ secondary school, but this is perhaps not so relevant to the case.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2013 at 9:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Hugh, I think others may also have asserted similarly as yourself.

Although all the names appearing there were common in 1st century Palestine, I consider that the fact that all the names may be associated with one specific family are highly significant, despite arguments to the contrary and denials by the I.A.A.  Pellegrino is on record as claiming that the Jesus ossuary contained little in the way of human remains, merely a carpal bone, and some shreds of linen. We might easily guess as to the reason for the carpal bone.  The linen fragments might have come from the TS, or else from some other cloth used as part of the burial. As to other outrageous claims made particularly by Jacobovici, they may be dismissed as absurd, and of a Dan Brown character. It will never be known if Talpiot was the Jesus family tomb or not, because all the material found in the ossuaries were buried in a common grave, and the ossuaries cleaned, in accordance with the lack of any scientific interest in possibly early Christian sites, typical of the I.A.A.\nMme Claude cites J P Meier’s “Marginal Jew” in discussing the paternity of Jesus, but Meier clearly dismisses the allegation of bastardy as a 2nd century myth invented by those hostile to Christianity. \nWhatever Talpiot is, it has to be no later than 70 AD, when the Jewish practice of placing remains in ossuaries suddenly ceased.\n\n","date":"October 7, 2013 at 12:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/06/one-persons-take-away-from-a-shroud-lecture/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"One Person’s Take Away from a Shroud Lecture"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A fascinating document, written in 1951.

It’s the classic work on Shroud forensics, has become something of a touchstone, a starting point for all Shroud forensic debates, is well-argued and is most authoritative as by an experienced forensic pathologist who also happens to know enough of the classics to be well read in matters pertaining to crucifixion, and punishment and other contemporary practices.  I see it still features prominently on the web, copies are available from Amazon, and you can probably find a copy in a good second-hand book-shop or a public library.  \nThere can be no doubt that the Shroud man fell while carrying his load, attested by injuries to the knees and nose on which there is the same dirt as on the soles of his feet, travertine aragonite, a rare form of limestone but which is commonly found in Jerusalem.  The impact of his load impacting on his shoulders as a result of falling are also evident.  All three synoptic gospels recount that Simon of Cyrene was pressed into service to assist with carrying the cross, and it may therefore be inferred that the scourged man had some difficulty in carrying it. \nBarbet goes into considerable detail in describing all these injuries as a result of falling, too long to replicate here, which is why I suggest you obtain a copy of his book.  A colleague, one Judica, had asserted that Jesus carried the whole cross, the lower half of the cross-beam hanging down in front, with the upper half over his right shoulder.  Judica had apparently asserted that the injuries to the left shoulder resulted from the upper half  of the cross beam falling across the man’s upper back and impacting on the left shoulder.  Barbet disagreed with this scenario, and considered that only the cross-beam was carried.  \nThere seem to be two possible ways the cross-beam might have been carried: Either a) as shown in the drawing above with the cross-beam  across the nape of the neck, with the man’s arms bound to it; Or b) as a workman might carry a beam on his shoulder, with the point of balance slightly behind, and held in place by the hands in front on the top surface.  Barbet was familiar with the second practice through workmen carrying railway sleepers (US = cross-ties) and the injuries incurred as a result of occasional falls.  He seems to envisage the trailing half of the cross-beam as crossing to the left when carried for purposes of balance, so that a fall would result in both shoulders being impacted.  His detailed description is so specific that you need to read it. \nIf you are able to obtain a copy of his work, your comments could be very enlightening in any further debates on the subject on this site.\n\n","date":"March 15, 2015 at 1:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I shouldn’t call it a rebuttal, but at least may be worth some serious consideration.\nNor can carrying the patibulum only be called a myth.  The assertion was probably first made by Barbet who devotes two separate sections to the question, a) Instruments of execution b) Carrying of the cross.  Barbet went to some pains to refute the assertions of a colleague, Judica, who had assumed that the whole cross was carried. \nNor was it necessary that the cross beam be carried across the nape of the neck as shown in the illustration.  Barbet referred to a time as a railway sapper in his youth when it was common for the workmen to carry a railway sleeper on the right shoulder, something which this correspondent is very familiar.  He even described the results of some of their falls and likened the evidence of their excoriations, including both on the right and left shoulder as a result, matching both the Shroud and Tunic evidences.  \nTo raise the whole cross requires ropes, some tricky logistics in hoisting, and backfilling with tamping to anchor the upright in its hole, to ensure that it stays securely vertical.  The only evidence for it is the partly damaged stone ring.at Holy Sepulchre, and whose use as such is conjectural.  Have any other stone rings be discovered, A ring would seem to require some tiresome and skillful work to construct from stone, but I suppose it might be done, they don’t occur naturally.  It would be a much simpler exercise merely to raise the patibulum with the crucified body on to an already fixed upright, and such ruthless efficiency is worth serious consideration, particularly if there are a number of prisoners to be executed.  Fixed uprights were a common enough feature throughout the empire, and having discovered an efficient way of carrying out executions, why would they vary it from a normal practice which had become standard? . \nBarbet’s explanation is worth reading in some detail, as he would seem to cover all the bases, including accounting for the apparent evidence on the Shroud and Tunic, classical references to the practices of crucifixion, its origin, and so on.\n\n","date":"March 14, 2015 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Some interesting comments, Jim.  It was Barbet who gave weight to the fixed stipes, prisoner carrying only the patibulum idea, and he cites a few classic authorities and Roman military efficiency in support of it.  In your para (1) you seem to support this notion, and then in your para (2) & (4) you revert to the prisoner being nailed to the full cross on the ground and then raising it using ropes.  Are you speculating that the stipes were kept upright at the site as a deterrent, and on the arrival of the execution party, the stipes were removed from their holes, the full cross then assembled, and then prisoner nailed on to the full cross?  If the stipes were only loosely kept in their holes, what would prevent thieves making off with the stipes for use as timber?  \nNot all agree that Zugibe successfully rebutted Barbet’s scenario.  As I recall from Zugibe’s published papers, his volunteer mounted a fixed-in-place cross, his hands being placed in gauntlets fitted with strain gauges, and his ankles bound by a strap to the upright.  The arm tensions measured were much less than those claimed by Barbet, as some of he weight was taken by the feet.  He then claimed that this data refuted the need for wrist nailing. \nIf we use Barbet’s scenario of nailing the prisoner to the cross-bar only, then the full weight needs to be taken by the arms at the time of raising, and for that case wrist nailing would be required.  Alternatively, Zugibe’s volunteer, with his ankles comfortably strapped, hardly simulates the excruciating pain of putting his whole body weight on a nail through his feet.  The prisoner would seek to relieve this pain by transferring his weight to his arms, when again the need for wrist nailing arises.  When the pan in his wrists and arms became unbearable, he would again transfer his weight back to his feet.  Thus giving rise to Barbet’s notion of a see-saw action.  So I don’t know that Zugibe’s account can be taken as the last word. \nIf the cross-bar only was carried, then it may not need to have been carried as you describe in para (2), with it lying across his back against the nape of the neck, with his arms bound to it.  It could be carried on one shoulder lying parallel to the direction of travel.  The prisoner’s wrists could still be bound to the leading end of the cross-bar to prevent him dumping it.  The excoriation below the left shoulder is consistent with a fall when the trailing end of the cross-bar impacts on his shoulder.  Barbet claimed to have observed similar wounds by railway workers when they occasionally stumbled when carrying railroad cross-ties.   \nAs crucifixion has not been regularly practised since about 325 AD, we can’t know the full details, and doubtless there were some variations in local practices anyway.  So that any reconstruction inevitably involves a degree of speculation.  Any comments?\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 2:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/14/rebuttal-of-a-long-standing-sindonological-myth/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Rebuttal of a long-standing sindonological myth"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Upon the death of Herod the Great, and after a riot had broken out in Jerusalem following an unwise speech by Archelaus when three thousand worshipers were killed, Archelaus left for Rome to ratify Herod’s will.

It seems that Chevalier accepted the 1525 document as valid, so what motivated Chevalier to make so much of the D’Arcis memorandum, in a deceptive way according to Markwardt?  The family connection between D’Arcis and Geoffroy I, via Alix de Joinville is intriguing, and so it would be surprising if D’Arcis did not know of King Philip’s donation of the Shroud to Geoffroy, so why did he denounce it, claiming it was painted by an artist?  Was it jealousy, or did he consider that it would be more appropriately housed in his own cathedral in Troyes, rather than an insignificant collegiate church in a small village?  The text of the bailli’s requisition of the Shroud from the De Charnay family, seemingly authored by D’Arcis, suggests that this would seem quite likely. \nJones’ 1343 dating of the king’s intention to endow Geoffroy with the Shroud certainly seems plausible, and he gives reason for this bequest, the (possible?) saving of the king’s son John II at Angiers.  The suggested involvement of the two Avignon popes Clement VI and Innocent IV, who Jones seems to imply knew of the plan to house the Shroud there, may explain the later Clement VII’s (another family connection) command of silence to D’Arcis. \nHugh’s comments concerning the alleged effigy of Geoffroy II in Froidment is apt, and it may be that this effigy is not Geoffroy II at all, but conceivably another knight of the same name, I think I can now count up to four separate Geoffroy’s de Charnay, including the templar burnt at the stake in 1314.

Galen’s studies in 22 volumes became the last word on anatomy until the sixteenth century.  Some dissections were carried out by Mondino de Luzzi (1275-1326) in Bologna.  In 1489 Leonardo da Vinci began a series of dissections on 30 cadavers until he was ordered to stop by Pope Leo X.  In the sixteenth century, the printing press enabled Galen’s work to be widely disseminated, and was criticised, drawing by drawing by Vesalius, who had permission to dissect the corpses from gallows.

If Steve Sekula does his job properly, then it can only be of benefit to his students.  The absence of these two disciplines is only too manifest on this site from to time.\nYoung people no longer seem to be able to think logically, and it all seemed to go downhill when Euclid was dropped from the school syllabus.\nSome social commentators, and even scientists seem to blame two French clowns, Jacques Derrida and Michael Foucault with their post-modernist philosophy, which can be summed up succinctly as “There’s no such thing as a truth statement”, essentially a nihilistic approach.  Unfortunately their influence has been unduly pervasive throughout much of Western culture.\nWe saw many “Wizards of Oz” during the 20th c, Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini; Their kind is also only too evident even during these early years of the  21st c, Gadaffi, al-Assad etc, .  However it takes a great deal of courage, bravery and heroism to pull aside the curtain and reveal that there’s nothing there at all.\nSekula could be stepping on tricky ground with the Shroud, but maybe the important thing here is that he covers the ground and evidence comprehensively.  It is probably not the sort of topic that can lead to a definitive conclusion, but may demonstrate the distinction between definite knowledge and a reasonable belief.

Are there any other icons represented in the negative? I don’t think so! \n(3) Again it is not necessary to appeal to the supernatural for the TS to be authentic.\n(4) Powdered paint is a novel speculation.

I’m unaware of any corroboration of this assertion. \n(6) Pollen & limestone traces. You assign an insight to your medieval forger centuries ahead of his time. \n(7) The original blog appears to fail to identify the true reason for the faulty C14 results – a medieval patch and failure to take representative samples.\n(8) I disagree that there are several examples of painted wrist nails. The only ones I’m aware of can generally be attributed to being modelled on the Shroud (possibly Pray manuscript). On the examples you claim, can you say if the thumb is visible or not? Jerome translated the Greek word chiras as manus (hand), resulting in centuries of artists showing palm-nailing. A foot-rest or seat prolongs the dying trauma. Gospels recount that Jesus died in 3 hours, which surprised Pilate. A seat or foot-rest was therefore unlikely in Jesus’ case.\n(9) Scourging: The scourge wounds have clearly been inflicted by the flagrum unique to the Romans, of which various examples have been found.

The longitudinal seam attaching the strip is visible and has been reported.    Clearly there must have been a longitudinal cut, otherwise a selvage would be visible at the seam.  It has been sewed according to Mme F-L by a Masada like cross-stitch. \nThere appear to be a number of possible options.\na)  The M-L hypothesis that the cloth was from a larger bolt of cloth, and cut into suitable widths to give a commercial product, perhaps of two cubits width; \nb) The original cloth was perhaps 117.2 cm wide, which was wider than the standard commercial width and was therefore deliberately reduced in width to make it standard, corresponding to two cubits. \nc)  The strip was made at some time after the image was formed, so that it would be more centrally placed for display purposes, and so appear symmetrical when mounted.

However, the question ought to be “Can I accept that they are indeed there or not?” The problem I have with this is that neurosurgeon specialists will tell us that the brain is wired to see patterns. So that what we may at first interpret as a visual pattern may have no substantive reality.\nAs an impressionable child, I still vividly recall being frightened in the dark by the patterns of light I perceived as various threatening faces or animals, which even entered my nightmares. My mother was an expert teller of imaginative stories, particularly of the ghostly kind, and perhaps these helped me to lay my childish fears to rest, and I came to rationalise my spectres as no more than tricks of the light, which indeed they were.  \nI am minded of the lines in Shakespeare’s play, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” having often taken part in several group readings. At its conclusion, King Theseus has the lines: “Or in the night, imagining some fear, / How easy is a bush supposed a bear!” In fact the whole play deals with questions of reality and perception in a way that only Shakespeare is capable of doing.   \nThis whole question of reality and perception in AMND is dealt with in an intriguing essay, “A Bush or a Bear?” by Cory Akin and can be found at: http://www.nwc.cc.wy.us/waw/essays/Essay54.pdf \nI have no objection to Vincenzo and Max continuing to have their party, atributing a reality to the resemblances they see, where the rest of us cannot. I am also familiar with the fact that primal peoples, Pacifica, Maori and African, will also attribute a reality to visual patterns which a modern rational mind may scorn. However if a substantive reality is to be attributed to patterns which some claim to see on the Shroud cloth, then I think it requires at least a level of reasonable consensus that such patterns are in fact perceived by more than a few. Otherwise it becomes too difficult to take these claims more seriously than perhaps we might. Even so, the question must remain as to whether they are merely tricks of the light, a trick in the weave, a pattern which are no more than a perception of our neurologically wired brains.\n\n","date":"May 22, 2013 at 7:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/20/the-worldwide-conspiracy-to-ignore-vincenzo-giovanni-ruello/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"HIGH NOON!

The margin of error must inevitably be quite large as age is not the only dependent variable.  The specific history of the parent cloth, such as frequency of folding and the various storage environments are also significant in affecting the parameters measured.  Thus the authors claimed a margin of error of 400 years, and found it was compatible within the time that Jesus lived.  The paper is highly technical and it is helpful to know something of the theory of Strength of Materials, a standard discipline in Engineering.  Parameters measured include Young’s Modulus, tensile strength, loss factor.  Other methods have also been used including Raman spectroscopy.  \n#5)  Cause of the image:  This remains unknown;  Possibilities include a) some as yet unknown naturalistic process; b) an artisan’s deliberate attempt by a process which still remains a secret; c) a miraculous divine intervention.  Despite various attempts to replicate the image, none have been really successful, and few if any attempts display all the known properties of the Shroud image.  If it was the result of an artisan, his identity is unknown and he left no record of either his attempts, or of his failures.  The forensic evidence displays a knowledge of anatomy not known in medieval times.  \n#6)  Unsmeared blood marks:  This is also part of the forensic evidence.  If say an artisan used even a crucified corpse to produce his image, then removal of the corpse would surely have resulted in smearing.  There are good indications that the blood marks occurred before the image.  However a miraculous resurrection could be expected not to smear the blood marks.  \nIt is important I think to weigh the totality of the available evidence, not necessarily any single one.  The evidence is necessarily circumstantial, and in such cases the total weight is what must determine any decision on the question of authenticity.

Meanwhile each must come to their own conclusion.  Those who assert that the Shroud is authentic, need to show why.  Those who assert that it is not, need to show why not!  \nAssuming authenticity, one thing that the Shroud does demonstrate, is that the image was fixed before there was any sign of corruption, and this image once formed did not deteriorate as a result of any subsequent corruption.  What then happened to the body?  \nOnce fixed, we still do not know soon the image first appeared – was it within the 40 hours or so Jesus was in the tomb, or was it much longer, even a hundred or so years.  I’m inclined to think it likely it was in the tomb, as otherwise why would a ritually unclean cloth be so carefully preserved?  Despite what Augustine has to say about what John came to believe when he entered the tomb (i.e. Augustine asserts he believed what the women had said), Augustine did not know about the Shroud image. claiming no-one knew the physical appearance of Jesus.  However if the image had already appeared, this gives a new slant on the particular text.  The image may still have had its own part to play in helping to form the disciples’ conviction that Jesus had indeed risen.  We can speculate, but we cannot assert either way.  But de Wesselow may not be the only one who can be mistaken about the role the image may have played.  They were plain folk, and it probably required several pieces of evidence for them to be eventually convinced: the empty tomb, the appearances in the upper room, at Emmaus, at the lake edge preparing a meal, even his Ascension, and just possibly the image on his burial cloth!

Indeed if a sedile was used, the victim might survive even for one or two days, or if the victim was tied to the cross instead of being nailed. However on p.84 in his “Doctor at Calvary” Pierre Barbet mentions the crucifragium as a Roman custom in passing. He cites Seneca, Ammienis Marcellinus, Origen and Plautus who all refer to it. It was a certain way of bringing about death. The reason being a natural instinct was for the victim to relieve oncoming asphyxia by using his legs to relieve the arm tension, and this resulted in a kind of see-saw motion, as the victim attempted to maintain breathing. In order for the crucifragium to be effective therefore, it would seem fairly likely that the femur was broken, as breaking the tibia would probably require a much greater leverage, being more resistant, and would probably result in only breaking the fibula first. The victim would then be no longer able to breathe and would quickly expire. The reason why it was carried out on the two thieves was that the Jews asked Pilate for it so that the bodies would not remain on their crosses during the sabbath which that year also happened to be Pesach [John 19:31]. \nBarbet also comments on the reasons for the more rapid death of Jesus as being the various pre-crucifixion trauma including scourging, buffeting, his Agony in Gethsemane etc. \nThe piercing with a lance was carried out as a legal requirement to ensure death had occurred whenever relatives asked for the body. \nAs a physician interested in these matters, Jesterof really needs to study Barbet’s text closely if he has not already done so, as he may be able to comment usefully upon it.\nAnother useful briefer reference is a paper “Crucifixion in Antiquity, the Anthropological Evidence”, By Joe Zias found at:\nhttp://www.joezias.com/CrucifixionAntiquity.html .  There is some variation from Barbet in the Zias’ reference, specifically the actual “cause of death” from crucifixion.

Later, Mahomet and Saladin’s domination of the East would likely have destroyed any remaining Christian relics, and any in France would more likely have come from Constantinople.

From this time on, several churches notably in Georgia begin to display icons depicting Christ, with facial features that bear striking resemblances to the Shroud image. They usually claimed to be based on the Mandylion image of Edessa. Edessa at this time had become a major centre of Syriac Christian scholarship. If the Mandylion was not in fact the Shroud, it would seem to have at least been based on it. However it was also claimed to have been “not made by human hands”, a description which readily fits the Shroud image. \nAs for there being no references to such images before the 6th century, it is just that Byzantine scholars are not adequately equipped to read pre-Constantine Christian code. We have for example the inscription of Avercius Marcellus, bishop of Hieropolis ~180-200: He describes his return journey from Rome having seen all the cities of Syria, in the company of one Palut, the name of one of the first bishops of Edessa, thus: \n“Faith everywhere led me forward, and everywhere provided as my food a fish of exceeding great size, and perfect, which a holy virgin drew with her hands from a fountain and this it ever gives to its friends to eat, it having wine of great virtue, and giving it mingled with bread.”  \nThe “fish of exceeding great size” is clearly not meant to be the eucharist, separately referred to at the end of the paragraph, but represents something else. It is during Avercius’ time as bishop that Abgar VIII becomes Christian, probably being baptized by Avercius, with the “fish of exceeding great size” as a visual aid, and hinted at in the pseudonymous allegory commissioned by Abgar VIII to mark the occasion, which became known as the doctrine of Addai. Avercius very likely returned the “fish of exceeding great size” to its place in Antioch, but it was subsequently brought back to Edessa, upon the impending destruction of that apostolic city.\n\n","date":"January 19, 2014 at 3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Anonymous’ Freudian slip: “… in the era prior to the arrival of MANDYLION in LIREY”  Oh, indeed??!! \nOrthodox Church use of Mandylion to bolster its own position: That in my view says little about the true nature of the Mandylion.

The path to maleness or femaleness originates at the moment of “meiosis” when a cell divides to produce sex cells or gametes having half the normal number of chromosomes.  A male XY cell divides to produce sperm, half of which is X and half of which is Y.  A female XX cell divides each producing an egg, all with one X cell.  If a Y sperm fertilises an egg, it produces a male XY; if an X sperm fertilises an egg it produces a female XX.  So the mystery is, “If Jesus was truly a man, where did he get his Y chromosomes from?” \nNow aberrations do occur, and in fact the whole history of life forms has depended on them, successful aberrations surviving and being passed onto new generations to become new life forms, less successful aberrations dying out.  For examples several disorders are associated with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, but conceivably other more benign aberrations might also occur.    \nA related theological question is, “In what way way is Jesus both God and man?”  The stock answer is that he did not have a human father, and the evangelist’s account only relates in the angel’s message to Mary “That the power of the Most High will overshadow thee.”  This probably suffices for the state of contemporary medical knowledge of the time, but is somewhat lacking in modern biological detail.   \nWe might speculate that it was God’s plan that Mary should have some chromosome cell aberration, enabling her to pass on a Y chromosome, possibly inherited from her father, or it may have involved some other unusual variation, or it might just have been some kind of miracle.  Some things I guess, we are just not entitled to know, and it need not affect one’s faith, unless one adopts a particularly and possibly unjustifiably dogmatic view of biology.

I think it may have been the Council of Nicea that determined after several “heresies” in the early Church that had merely sought a solution to the problem, that Jesus was truly God and truly man.  If Jesus is truly man, then God has placed a deliberate temporary limit on Himself as to how He might manifest the second person of His trinitarian self.  I should think He can go only so far without abandoning this agenda of adopting a truly human nature.  If He went beyond that limit, it might be said that in fact the worldly manifestation of Jesus was not in fact truly human at all, but actually something else, and that might be a problem in asserting the truth of his human nature.

It was even a popular public topic in the Greek market places.  \n“Arianism, which denied Christ’s essential divinity, aroused an all-pervasive reaction in the 4th century; the task of the first two ecumenical councils, at Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), was to affirm the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. In the 5th century the Christological question moved to the fore, and the Council of Chalcedon (451), completing that of Ephesus (431), defined Christ as one person in two natures. The Christological controversies of the 5th century were extremely complex, involving not only theological issues but also issues of national concerns—especially in the Syrian-influenced East, where the national churches were called non-Chalcedonian because they rejected the doctrinal formulas of the Council of Chalcedon.”  [Encyc Brit] \nThe ‘one person in two natures’ is a convenient formula within the human limitations of language to express a supernatural truth, and it is evident that it did not find universal acceptance outside of the establishment orthodoxy.  It continued to exercise many great minds even well after Chalcedon.  Perhaps to some extent it is merely semantics and a playing with words, in terms  limited by mere human experience.  And of course all of this occurred outside of our modern understanding of detailed human biology. \nIt might be argued that ‘to share all human traits’ is not necessarily to be fully human.  How, for instance, is it to be fully human without having a human father?  The scientific questions concerning AB blood type and the necessity of Y chromosomes to be male, perhaps raise modern issues to be addressed.  I don’t pretend to have the answers to these questions, and perhaps the mystics might have a better answer than the theologians.  We are taught by a church, which although divinely inspired and led by the Spirit, still comprises only human teachers using human language.  There is a greater Truth.  A scriptural verse keeps coming to my mind, ‘ “My ways are not your ways” saith the Lord. ‘  Perhaps we can do no better than that and accept it.\n\n","date":"April 14, 2015 at 4:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/13/with-anyone-interested-in-listening/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"With Anyone Interested in Listening"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis: “As commented earlier, If it were not for him (Wilson), there would be no shroud websites,books, papers, conferences, congresses and…. this shroudstory blog.”  Agree completely!

One does not have to resort to anti-christian conspiracies to do so.  I use several sources, one of them for instance is John Bowden former editor and managing director of the SCM Press, London, and he is hardly likely to be anti-christian in sentiment.  An article by Bowden I have before me, gives a date of authorship of Acts as “probably between 85 and 95 AD”, likely towards the end of Luke’s life.  \nThere are several significant omissions in Acts, so that of the deaths of Peter & Paul is hardly noteworthy.  Apart from chapters 1 & 2, we hear nothing of what happened to most of the original apostles, even though there are many other traditions concerning them.  We hear nothing of the Alexandrian church although it was clearly very healthy and significant, and there are only occasional references to the church in Antioch, although it became a principal early centre of christian scholarship.  \nNevertheless the tensions between the Jewish and Gentile wings of the early church are sufficiently memorable for Luke to draw attention to them in Acts, and are frequently evident in Paul.  A further example of this tension might be seen in Luke’s mentioning the neglect of Hellenistic widows and orphans, necessitating the appointment of gentile deacons, as it seems the Jewish members were still not prepared to minister to them.  So this attitude held sway for quite some time.  \nWhen we come to the gospels, all of this seems very much in the past.  Thus it is the specifically Jewish rejection of Christ which is at fault, whereas there seems to be an attempt to attenuate the fault of the gentile Roman authorities.  Thus ‘Pilate knows that it out of jealousy that the chief priests had delivered Jesus and he seeks to free him’, possibly to be seen as the author’s attempt to minimise the true responsibility of imperial authority in the final condemnation, and to excuse it by placing the blame on the Jewish authorities.   \nFurther evidence is suggested in the destruction of the temple, omitted in earlier Mark, but which seems to have already happened “as prophesied” in the other three gospels, although perhaps it might not have been so difficult to foresee.  \nWith the expectation of an early Parousia, little point in committing the account to writing would be seen, as everything was soon to come to an end.  When this didn’t happen and as the first witnesses passed on, this perception would clearly change, and the need for leaving a written record proclaiming Jesus as the Christ then became more compelling.\n\n","date":"April 20, 2015 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I cannot accept OK’s assertion that the gospels were set down as early as he says, nor in fact does mainstream New Testament scholarship.  There are several arguments against it, but I shall attempt to confine my comments to a few brief remarks.  \nIt seems clear enough that Mark was the first of the gospels to be set down fairly close to its present form, although it seems the final original chapter may been lost and replaced by a later addition.  Occasionally some have argued for a Matthean priority, but it seldom withstands scrutiny.  Examining the common material in Matthew Mark & Luke, one finds a closer affinity between Matthew & Mark, and between Luke & Mark, than between Matthew and Luke, and this therefore argues for Marcan priority.   There is additional common material found in Matthew and Luke, not found in Mark, and this has argued for an additional separate Q source.  All four gospels closely follow the Marcan narrative of the passion death and resurrection, with only minor changes of some details, according to the specific author’s proclamation intent.\nInterestingly there is a concluding literary discrepancy between Matthew/Mark and Luke.  Thus Matthew’s narrative begins at Bethlehem, (the Nazarene origins of Mary and Joseph seem unknown to him), and following Mark’s cue, the apostles are instructed to go to Galilee where Jesus will meet them there.  Luke on the other hand knows of the Nazareth origins of the family, and has his own separate nativity narrative with a journey to Bethlehem.  However Luke concludes his gospel by having the apostles remaining in Jerusalem.  In Acts, Luke continues with his Jerusalem location, (literary continuity), the first half of the work being devoted to the Jerusalem church, and the second half on Paul’s mission to the gentiles.  It concludes with Paul going to Rome, the centre of the empire, the centre of the world.  Thus Luke’s mise-en-scene traverse is Nazareth – Jerusalem – Rome!  The church is now “global”, has “arrived” and this makes for a satisfying conclusion.  Luke is not interested in recording the death of either of his leading characters Paul or Peter, it is not part of his “proclamation” and its omission is a weak argument for assigning either Acts or Luke a prior date.  \nTurning now to the Pauline epistles, it is evident that Paul devotes much focus to the tensions between the Jewish origin of the apostles and his own “subversively regarded” mission to the gentiles.  The tensions between himself and Peter are recorded.  Luke, companion of Paul, also devotes some attention to it in the Acts, such as at the Council in Jerusalem, and elsewhere.  Luke has Peter seeing a large sheet descending from heaven with many “unclean” animals who he is instructed to eat, a partial resolution of this tension.  \nHowever this tension is not reflected in the gospel accounts.  The gentile church is fully established, Matthew’s gospel is clearly directed to a gentile community, probably Syrian, but perhaps not necessarily Antioch.  His gospel is used in the Syrian church.  We do not see the Jewish-Gentile contentions evident in the Pauline epistles, nor in Luke’s Acts.  The contentions are now in the past, and the church is essentially gentile.  As early has his nativity account Matthew even has gentile wise men visit the infant in the manger.  Contrast this with Luke’s Jewish shepherd visitors.  It is reflected even in Matthew’s concluding discourse where the apostles are instructed to preach the gospel “to all nations”.  I think all these are strong arguments for a relatively late compilation of the gospels. \nThe actions and sayings of Jesus would have given rise to many oral traditions, and typical of such societies would soon have acquired a set form to be learned by rote by those trained to proclaim them.  They would have soon been committed to writing.  The distinctive pericope form of nearly all of the gospel narratives, clearly indicate that this would have been the case.  Most of them are terse, brief episodic accounts of individual separate incidents, and are not in the form of a fully integrated continuous narrative.  The various authors of the gospels would have assembled their sources, giving them a form and using them to express their own individual particular proclamation intent.  Their integrity can be deduced by the relative consistency of the four separate accounts, and reliance on a social tradition well used to critical appraisal of formal oral recitation by rote.   This last cannot be over-emphasised, but is still evident in other present primal pre-literate societies.  It is not necessary to assert an earlier compilation into their present final form.\n\n","date":"April 20, 2015 at 4:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"OK: The only argument you seem able to muster for a pre-70 AD compilation of the gospels is that the death of Peter and Paul are omitted in Luke’s book of the Acts.  I have already given reasons why this is an inadequate argument.  \n“The Gospels are stories about Jesus, not the problems (greater or smaller) of the early church.”  Yes, but you’re not reading the sub-text, and you are not applying any principles of form-criticism.  We could equally say that in Paul, his epistles are directed at admonishing his converts to follow the Christian way of life, yet the tensions between the Jewish and Hellenistic wings of the early church are very much to the forefront and are frequently mentioned, Luke recalling them in Acts.  These tensions are clearly in the past when we come to the gospels, which are generally addressed to a fully Hellenised church.  \nThe consensus seems to be that Mark’s gospel was probably written between 64-70 AD.  This is in agreement with a tradition that Mark wrote his gospel after the death of Peter.  In Mk ch 13, Jesus foretells the destruction of the temple, but it still seems to be standing at the time of writing, and this leads on to a discussion of the end-time when the Son of Man will come in glory.  Matthew and Luke, depending as they do on Mark, were clearly written at a later time.  Matthew’s “prophecy” of the destruction of the temple seems to already have occurred.  The “abomination of desolation” is a phrase adopted from Daniel which refers to Antiochus Epiphanes erecting a statue of Zeus Olympus  there, and is equated with a similar subsequent desecration of the temple by the Romans, which seems to have already occurred.  \nI cannot see how you can call the Parousia a pseudo-theory.  If everything was going to come to an early end, there would seem to be little point in leaving any kind of early record for any posterity.  Clearly when the Parousia did not happen as expected, this perception changed.  \nThe consensus of all main-stream New Testament scholars is that the gospels of Matthew, Luke and John were all written at some time after 70 AD.  Your hypothesis that they were set down before this time is singular to yourself and finds no good support from elsewhere.  I suggest that the literate character of your modern western experience blinds you to the strength of oral traditions in pre-literate societies, which traditions and pericopes formed the basis of the original gospel sources.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2015 at 4:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I am rather more informed on New Testament scholarship than you seem prepared to give me credit.

You are concerned that a later compilation of the gospels compromises the argument for their factual reliability, whereas their reliability easily rests on their mutual consistency and the strength and integrity of oral tradition in 1st century Middle Eastern cultures.  It is not surprising that Matthew places the words of Daniel in the mouth of Jesus;  Matthew’s detailed knowledge of the scriptures pervades his entire gospel.  Your evaluation of the consensus of NT scholarship as worthless, is your own personal subjective judgement having no good standing, and as you say leaves you open to a charge of fanatacism rather than demonstrating objectivity.  \nI have nothing more to say on the matter.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2015 at 3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The obituary and memorial accounts in Dan’s last link above to the Amherst College Magazine make for very sad reading.

As yet, I think it is fair to say that the Shroud cannot qualify as being a legitimate historic document, despite all the advances made in Shroud research, although it might do at some time in the future.  No historian is going to run the risk of compromising his reputation by using the Shroud as such a resource.  It does not as yet meet the required criterion of rigour.  Any historian using the Shroud as a source for his assertions, would be moving outside the limits imposed by the discipline.

Kosiewicz had analysed the rates of vanillin loss from lignin at a variety of temperatures for over 2 years, and shown that loss rates of vanillin was very low.”\nAs Colin points out, the rate of loss, being a chemical and not a radionuclide process is dependent on several environment factors.  Roger’s math model showed the loss rate for 95% of vanillin in lignin was 1319 year at temp 25C, but increased to 3095 years at 20C, and so it’s apparent that the loss rate is very susceptible to temp variation.  Rogers claimed that the fire of 1532 would not have affected the results much “as the cloth would not\nhave absorbed much heat”. Rogers also stated that if the Shroud was created in 1260AD then 37% of the vanillin would have remained in the cloth.  No samples from any part of the shroud itself gave a positive result for any trace of vanillin.\nRegardless of the detailed figures, I believe that the key finding that there was no trace of vanillin, has surely to be significant.  Yet Rogers claimed that vanillin and also significant cotton contamination was found in the sample swatch.  If that is so, then that also has to be sgnificant. \nI delved further, and was rewarded with the discovery of a detailed paper, being a debate on this work: “Private Internet Debate Challenges Ray Rogers’ Thermochimica Acta Paper”\n– An exchange of views between Mark Antonacci and Dr. Thibault Heimburger.\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/debate.pdf   \nPaper was submitted for publication to Barrie Schworz some six weeks after Roger’s death, and Barrie obviously considered it bad form to allow it.  However this is really an excellent detailed paper, and those at all interested in the topic should study it.  Antonacci disputes Roger’s findings, and gives several criticisms against it.  Interestingly, Antonacci maintains his belief that the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Rabbi Yeshua.  Antonacci’s paper is then followed by a rebuttal from Thibault Heimburger, who I think does a reasonably competent job of countering many of Antonacci’s arguments.  \nThe debate is too long and detailed to summarise in brief, but both arguments should certainly be examined closely by anyone at all interested in the issues raised.  The paper was ultimately posted on the Yahoo ShroudScience group by Giulio Fanti on May 11, 2005. \nMessage to John Klotz, Yannick Clement, and Colin Berry:  If you haven’t already done so, you all really need to peruse the Antonacci / Heimburger paper before commenting further on this topic.

All of them were secretive in much of their work, and often reluctant to publish.  Newton completed his best work during his house confinement during the Black Plague in Oxford, withholding his discovery of the calculus until after Leibniz had already published; Fermat was prone to announcing his discoveries without proof nor documentation, challenging others to replicate them, Gauss was aloof and reclusive, often not publishing his best work e.g. writing to Bolyai, that he had already made those geometrical discoveries and Bolyai still had two-thirds of the work required to complete – this was typical of Gauss; Many of Gauss’s discoveries were only revealed in note form after his death. \nEstablishment of the Royal Society in England and the Academy of Science in France, both in the latter 17th century, was a watershed in scientific development.  However science in general remained the poor relation of academia until the middle of the 19th century with the first developments in heavy industry and technology.  As Corporates and Nationals became more involved during the 20th century, the scope for individual pioneering work seems to have become more constrained with increasing demands for rigour and peer review.  Research was directed at those areas where a profit might be made, or where national interests might best be served.  \nThere is little monetary gain to be obtained in researching the sindon, and much of the work seems to have been carried out on a volunteer basis by passionate individuals who were drawn into its mysteries.  Hence the work is vulnerable to criticism by those whose vocations and career experience have allowed them to draw on more generous funding and resources where high standards of scientific achievement have been demanded.   \nI get the impression that Ray Rogers very likely carried out much of his work alone, and this was probably the result of his choice of subject.  In any pioneering work, there has to be trade-offs between quantity and quality – and in the area of undiscovered country, quantity has to be a strong temptation.  I understand there remain as yet some eight or so unopened crates held by STURP, containing as yet unknown further results of Roger’s work on the Shroud.  \nWhereas Antonacci has made severe, possibly valid, criticisms of Roger’s claims on inferences from the vanillin content or its absence, Heimburger’s response to those criticisms also needs to be acknowledged.  The vanillin content and cotton contamination of the C14 sample swatch is surely significant, in relation to the absence of both in the main cloth.  Heimburger’s comments on Mme Flury-Lemburg’s limited understanding of the Shroud and its complexity as at 1988 has also to be noted, as also his comments on the capabilities of medieval “invisible repair” work. \nIt is evident that there is yet a long way to go in Shroud research, but this will require a level of funding that may be difficult to access, and also a change in the understandably protective attitude of their artifact by the relevant church authorities.

Any fair-minded critique of Wilson deserves to be heard.  However I would tend to concur with Jones’ general view that Freeman’s paper is not so fair-minded.  It is only too apparent I feel  that Freeman’s agenda is suspect.  I am not persuaded by Freeman’s arguments.  It includes for example this type of circular reasoning (to precis):  Early Byzantine art forms would not present a dead Christ (and so would not show blood stains for instance)  Notwithstanding the apparent presence of Vignon markings on their images (icons and coins) showing Christ, he is shown as alive and triumphant, without blood stains;  therefore the image on Shroud could not have been used as the model on their icons and coins.  There is more that I am not satisfied with, for example that there were so many relics and imitations that there could have been no original model; that although the negative image clearly shows a dead Christ, this is not so apparent on the original cloth.  I may attempt to address these after I have studied Freeman’s paper in more depth. \nI did not see in Freeman’s paper an attempt to address Jack Markwardt’s modification of Wilson’s hypothesis, that the Shroud was kept in Antioch until the the 6th century; nor Scavaone’s modification that it was kept in Besancon after being sent to Athens, rather than being held by the Knights Templar.  Both of these hypotheses seem more credible than Wilson’s primary hypotheses. \nDespite Andrea’s claim that much other research had already been carried out in European countries, Ian Wilson deserves credit for reaching a wider public in English-speaking countries, and making the Shroud of some topical interest in these countries.  As far as I am aware his is one of the few attempts to vest the Shroud with some kind of historical provenance prior to the 14th century, and thus oblige a sceptical world to take it more seriously, than it had hitherto.\n\n","date":"September 2, 2012 at 5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/01/hat-trick-to-freeman-jones-unhorsed-too-bad/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Hat trick to Freeman!

We only remember their successes, and overlook their failures.\n1) Aristotle’s Biology became a classic which survived into the European Enightenment, but he screwed up badly in his Physics.\n2) Robert Hooke, devised many inventions and devices for the Royal Society, including his invention of the microscope, but refused to accept Newton’s Theory of Light, and persisted in his belief that colours arose from a mixture of Darkness and Light.\n3) Johannes Kepler who first postulated the elliptic orbit of Mars, believed that the space between the planets was comprised of Platonic polyhedra.\n4) Galileo Galilei was unwilling to accept Kepler’s elliptic orbits, and preferred to maintain a Platonic ideal of circular motion for the planets and moon.\n5) Isaac Newton spent much of his final years in pursuing the mystical notions of Hermetic philosophy, and despite his universal renown, quarreled with everybody, including tearing out several pages from his Prinicipia which referred to John Flamsteed’s work.\n6) Few scientists in the 17th c would accept the pioneering work of Niklaus Steno in geology, but preferred to believe that fossil shells either grew in the parent rock or were the remnants of the Noachian flood.\n7) Huygen’s theory of light as a wave gave way to Newton’s theory that light was comprised of corpuscles.  When Thomas Young’s experiments with interference patterns demonstrated that light was indeed a wave there was an outcry from scientists in Britain offended that their hero was being challenged.  It was left to the European Fresnel to develop the wave theory of light.  Even so the wave character of light must have been evident to Newton from his light rings observable during lens grinding and the fringe patterns at the edges of his prism colours.\n9)  Despite chemists working on the hypothesis of an atomic theory for some 100 years, Ernst Mach would not accept Boltzmann’s atomic theory working from statistical mechanics, declaring as late as 1905 that he did not believe in atoms which were merely conjectural.  Mach’s influence with the European academies resulted in Boltzmann committing suicide.\n10) Albert Einstein could not accept the random behaviour of quanta, and spent the last years of his life fruitlessly searching for underlying variables that did not exist.\n11)  Einstein had demonstrated that no object with mass could exceed the speed of light, as otherwise the mass would become infinite.  Recent LHC work indicates that neutrinos may very well exceed the speed of light.\nAll these men had remarkable scientific achievements to their credit, yet they were clearly not infallible, and their obsession with some pet theory would sometimes lead them well astray and off the mark.\nWe need to remember this when faced with unsupported narrowly-focused pontifications from a scientist with much to his credit, and whose principal defence appears to accuse his opposition of pseudo-science, or of claims of personal ad hom arguments.\nWith so much unknown about the origins of the Shroud image, it is unfortunate that so much effort is being expended on a lame-duck theory, when there may well be more fruitful lines of enquiry to pursue.\n\n","date":"March 17, 2012 at 5:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/17/welcome-to-colin-berrys-new-straw-shedder-blog/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Welcome to Colin Berry’s new Straw Shedder blog"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick, If you didn’t want to try it with the family cat, you could maybe hunt out a few mink, beaver, even a fox or two or possibly a lynx, from up Ungava way.  ;-))\n\n","date":"January 2, 2013 at 6:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Just watched the video.

I believe there would be very little evidence for Jesus seeking to remove the yoke of the Romans from the Jewish people. \nThere was a yoke, but I believe he saw it being imposed more by the Jewish authorities, Pharisaic Laws and the Saducees, rather than the Romans.  An objective view of history might come to the conclusion that the Jewish people never had it so good under the peace inaugurated by Octavian Augustus, and even the Idumean Herods were great benefactors, and relatively benign, despite the gospel accounts and the aversion of the Jews to their Edomite governance.  \nThe gospels seem to reflect an expectation that the Messiah would be some kind of political liberator, but nowhere is that apparent in Jesus’ life-mission.  The political reality of the Jews, sandwiched between the Romans and the Persians or Parthians, would make any prospect of their being any kind of a buffer state unrealistic, and the Romans were by far the best choice of any options they had.  The rebellions commencing about 66AD, eventually proved disastrous. \nIf there is to be any kind of acceptance of Jesus within the Jewish tradition, it must I think be seen in his prophetic role within the tradition of the later prophets, in proclaiming an option for the poor, the underprivileged in his demands for justice, and his condemnation of immorality. It is consistent with and echoes such calls as those of Amos, Micah and Malachi. Jesus’ condemnation of the Pharisees and Saducees, as a “brood of vipers” and “hypocrites” is foreshadowed by their somewhat similar condemnations. \nJohn Dominic Crossan’s “Power of Parable” provides some fascinating insights into what appears to be a double-edged sword of Jesus’ message, a theme in Rabbi Boteach’s work. Thus early in Matthew’s gospel he condemns slandering and abuse of others, yet later he fulminates against the authorities with his “hypocrites” and “brood of vipers”.  A further aspect mentioned by Crossan is that the Synoptics, particularly Gentile Luke, paint Jesus as the victim of the Jews, with their saying “His blood be on us and upon our children”, which has provided unjust rationalisation of historical anti-semitism.  However in John’s gospel, Jesus is not the victim, but is the one in control of his situation. The decisions are his, even the choice of his moment of death. \nHis answer to the question of the temple tribute to “Render unto Caesar” doen not betoken a political liberator. But he clearly intended to be the liberator of those who were in fact heavily burdened, and had little interest in the misplaced Jewish nationalism of that time!\n\n","date":"September 10, 2013 at 7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/10/david-rolfe-challenge-to-richard-dawkins-embedded-in-pj-media-article/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"David Rolfe challenge to Richard Dawkins embedded in PJ Media article"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis, I am adequately aware of Crossan’s doctrinal short-comings.

I found much that is good in Crossan’s “Power of Parable”.  To attack everything that a person teaches, because of other errors, is I consider a form of “Ad hominem” argument and a “Non sequitur”.  Concerning my principal argument that Jesus sought to be a liberator of those who were genuinely suppressed, I find it interesting that Pope Francis is apparently seeking to revive an acceptable form of Liberation theology.  I am an advocate of John P Meier’s historical approach.  I do not see anything in the gospels or in Paul, supporting the idea that sees Jesus as any kind of a political liberator from Roman imperialism, as apparently argued by Rabbi Boteach.

He illustrates this showing a needle through the hand of a stabbing victim, the exit point certainly close to the base of the hand, and pretty well at the wrist.  Other pathologists, Willis & Bucklin seemed to agree with Barbet on the matter, exit point at the wrist. Zugibe’s theories on the nail not completely through the wrist relies entirely on his assertion that adequate support at the feet would relieve the tension in the arms. Arm tension would be 207 lbs without any support at the feet. This tension would tear through the palms, unless it was taken by the carpal bones.  Zugibe claimed that foot support would reduce the tension to only 67 lbs. Doing the statics, Zugibe is therefore saying that the arm tension is only taking 56 lbs maximum of the vertical weight of 176 lbs, and that 119 lbs minimum are being taken by the single nail through the feet.

This could only have been the patibulum, maybe about the size of a timber rail-road sleeper. This is feasible for your average rail-road man. The complete cross with upright would be far too heavy to be feasible for him to carry. It implies that the upright (stipes) was already in position securely in the ground. If it wasn’t already in the ground, but joined to the patibulum at the site, and the crucifarius nailed hands and feet while lying down, this is far too much work for the execution party to lift the body and cross complete into the hole, and is inefficient. \nIt implies that the hands only were nailed to the patibulum with the crucifarius being held lying down.  The patibulum with the crucifarius suspended from it, is then easily lifted onto the stipes. Now at this stage, the full weight of the body drops suspended by the hands, and the full arm tension of 207lbs has to be taken by the hands.  It is necessary that the hands take the full arm tension during this process, and this can only be done if the wrists are nailed so that wrist bones can take the tension.\nWith the patibulum now in position on the stipes, the feet can then be nailed onto the stipes with however many nails it takes. It is only then that the arm tension can be relieved by transferring some of the weight onto the feet. \nThe only other way it can be done is if two of the execution party take the weight of the body until the feet are nailed.

Barbet envisaged a type of see-saw motion, necessary to enable the crucifarius to breathe.  Therefore he considered that the weight had to be taken completely by the arms, at least at some phase during this motion. For a 175lb body with arms at 65deg to the vertical, the arm tension is easily calculated to be 207lb.  That’s too high a tension to be taken by the flesh of the palms. It has to be taken somehow by the wrist bones if tearing is not too occur. \nZugibe’s experiment involved strapping the volunteer’s feet to the upright, and measuring the arm tension with load cells fastened to the volunteer’s gauntlets. He claimed that the maximum arm tension was then only 67lb.  So it all depends if you consider whether strapping the feet in this way is an adequate simulation of a nail through the feet. I personally can’t see it. Taking some 75% of the body weight onto the cluster of tarsal bones must have been excruciating, and I would think there would be a natural tendency to transfer the weight back onto the arms, and the risk of palm tearing would be too high. \nRoman executioners would no doubt vary in their competence and experience. I would expect that most would go for the wrist, and some would be better at it than others, sometimes possibly with the accuracy and expertise that Barbet claimed. Correspondents obviously vary in their opinions as to the whereabouts of the nail exit position. However it is just not possible to sustain a 207lb arm tension by palm flesh alone, and somehow or another it needs to be taken by a wrist bone, or a cluster of bones.\n\n","date":"December 14, 2013 at 6:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/13/was-zugibe-deliberately-and-dishonestly-trying-to-mislead-his-readers/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Was Zugibe deliberately and dishonestly trying to mislead his readers?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"A fascinating interview, Louis, which sheds further light on Prof Fanti’s viewpoint.

As John Klotz mentioned to me in an email: “If there is ever an appropriate time to deal with the pssing of a loved one, perhaps Holy Week is the week to do it.”  \nThere are fundamentally three aspects that merit comment: 1) Publishing the book before the science had been peer-reviewed; 2) the reaction of the Turin authorities disclaiming the samples; 3) the science that Fanti used to obtain his conclusions. \n1) There has already been comment on this back-to-front way of doing things.  However it is apparently notoriously difficult to obtain peer-review in reputable journals to obtain an objective reaction on scientific work conerning the TS, although apparently the work has indeed been submitted. Perhaps Fanti considered his “discovery” was too important to languish while agenda-driven reviewers debated his paper. I would doubt that that his motive was profit-driven book sales – I would guess that the remuneration of a dean of a mechanical engineering institution would be more than adequate for one’s needs.  The obvious diasvantage is that it leaves open accusations of seeking sensationlism.  It is unfortunate that only Italian versions are available, as there is a larger catchment of interest.    \n2) The reaction of the Turin authorities in disowning the samples used seems to be gross over-kill, in fact an own-goal.  If Turin had misgivings about the samples, a more cautious reaction would seem to have been more prudent.  It may be that Fanti has provided a strong argument for authenticity, but Turin has now shot itself in the foot by disowning this work. In the land of the Florentine Niccolo Machiavelli, one might have expected more political nous, and less silly posturing.  \n3) There has been little in any English press releases about any details of the work beyond the claims made and the general methodologies, but no specifics.  One is left making all sorts of speculative inferences, and possible objections come readily to mind. One expects that there is no fundamental theoretical basis for the inductions made, but that it is entirely empirical, essentially a type of statistical regression analysis.  The underlying assumption seems to be that the various properties tested will be solely age-related with little influence from other variables.  For example (a) various species of flax – there are many such – Is it known how their properties vary across species? Can the flax species for the various samples be identified? Properties can be expected to vary according to the various processing methods to extract the linen, variable chemical effects, dyeing, retting processes, effects of heat? What about the correlation ratios, and tests of significance? Until a lot more information is available, we are left in a vacuum of ignorance at drawing any kind of valid conclusion!\n\n","date":"April 1, 2013 at 4:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/01/alan-boyles-cosmic-log-on-fantis-new-book/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Boyles Cosmic Log on Fanti’s New Book"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Piero for your ref on earthquake lights, a phenomenon I had not taken account of, as it seems to be fairly rare.

We usually have a few earthquakes of at least intensity 5.0 each year,  occasionally up to 7.0.  I recall very few reports, if any of the occurrence of earthquake lights at these times.

It usually occurs near the ground during thunderstorms, in close association with cloud-to-ground  lightning. It may be red, orange, yellow, white, or blue in colour and is often accompanied by a hissing sound and distinct odour. It normally lasts only a few seconds, usually moving about and then vanishing suddenly, either silently or explosively. Ball lightning has been reported to cause damage by burning or melting but is usually harmless. Its causes and its relation to common lightning are not known, but among the suggested explanations are: air or gas behaving abnormally, high-density plasma phenomena, an air vortex containing luminous gases, and microwave radiation trapped within a plasma bubble. Sometimes bead lightning is mistaken for ball lightning. Bead lightning is most apparent when the current in a cloud-to-ground flash persists for an appreciable fraction of a second. In these cases, the luminosity also persists and the channel may have regions of enhanced luminosity that resemble a string of beads.”\n\n","date":"July 17, 2014 at 5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/15/a-telling-interview-with-giulio-fanti/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Telling Interview with Giulio Fanti"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I find it difficult to follow Piero’s line of argument here.  The use of electricity was practically unknown in ancient times.  L Sprague de Camp in his “The Ancient Engineers” p.252 suggests that electro-plating of metals may have been known in Iraq and possibly the Orient.  He refers to some mysterious jars found near Khujut Rabu’a near Baghdad in 1936 and also at the ruins of Seleucia-on-the-Tigris, which may have been used for this purpose.  Otherwise occasional demonstrations of static electricity were little more than a toy and entertainment, but their nature certainly not understood. \nPiero also refers to Cordiglia’s attempts to create an image using 90,000 volts of electricity.  The potential difference between cloud and ground in a lightning strike are of the order of 10 to 100 million volts, the peak return currents are of the order of 30,000 amperes, peak temperatures in the return-stroke channel are of the order of 30,000 deg C, leader stroke reaches the ground in about 30 ms, and the return stroke reaches the cloud in about 100 ms.  (Encyc Brit). \nI’m not sure what he means by the radon being a joke, and he asks what was the radon plateau reached to create an image.  I can only refer him to De Liso’s work which seems to be one of the few papers where this has been explored, but she does not seem to cover this question in a quantitative way.   Some investigators have attempted to postulate hypotheses involving radon, but its role of course is not at all known.  \nIt is not known what created the TS image, and I believe that all options are on the table.  Radon may have been involved, not necessarily as a primary cause, but possibly as providing some kind of collimation of the image forming particles whatever they were.  We can speculate, but without the essential experimental investigations being carried out, I believe we remain still working in the dark.  I suspect that the process may be so complex, that the use of Occam’s razor here to isolate a single cause is unlikely to enlighten the true cause of the image.\n\n","date":"July 16, 2014 at 5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/15/a-telling-interview-with-giulio-fanti/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Telling Interview with Giulio Fanti"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I disagree.

However, in discussing the instruments of crucifixion Barbet is able to cite several classical sources to support his case, whereas Zugibe seems to be relying entirely on his own static experiments with volunteers and drawing his conclusions entirely from those. \nPart of Zugibe’s critique is that the high arm tensions calculated by Barbet, are not necessary as he claims that the foot support was sufficient to reduce these arm tensions considerably.  That could be debated, as during the death agonies of the crucified he would at times seek to relieve the pain in his feet by transferring the weight to his arms. \nHowever it is Barbet’s contention that the vertical stipes was a permanent fixture, and that the condemned man was only required to carry the patibulum, the cross-piece.  Stipes were certainly a permanent fixture in the colosseum. Having been brought to the place of execution, the man is laid flat on the ground, and his outstretched arms nailed to the patibulum. Binding might be used to restrain his struggling. With the nailing complete, four executioners could then easily lift the patibulum on to the stipes. At this stage the man’s complete weight is taken by the arms, the arm tension increasing as his feet leave the ground and his body falling to the vertical position. It is only when his feet are nailed to the stipes that he can relieve his arm tension. Consequently this method requires that the nails be placed in a location where they will not tear through the palms, as the arm tension can exceed 200 pounds force. \nIt is only if the man is nailed to the full cross while lying on the ground, that wrist nailing might be avoided. The whole cross with the man attached would then have to be lifted by the execution party, and placed into a prepared hole.  This is obviously a rather more onerous and inconvenient process for the executioners. I am not informed of any sources that assert that this method was ever a normal practice, despite many artistic portrayals of it. \nBarbet traces the background history of the implements used for crucifixion, and is able to cite classical texts in support of his argument. Wherever the nailing may have occurred at the base of the hands, it seems to be quite necessary that the nails be placed so that the man’s weight could be transferred using bony structures to avoid tearing of the palms at some stage during the process.\n\n","date":"March 25, 2014 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I have just noted Charles Freeman’s comments #2-#6, and his expectation that Fanti might have a defender. He should be more patient, we have a 12 hour time zone difference, and his comments were posted in the middle of the night here. \nProfessor Fanti is an academic mechanical engineer, not a pure scientist; although it is true that European engineering tends to be more focused on the pure sciences than are practitioners with an English or American tradition which tend to draw more on applied sciences. \nIf authentic, the actual true dating of the Shroud will only give one limit for the dating of the crucifixion, the earliest possible but not the latest possible. Likewise the actual true dating of the crucifixion would only give the latest possible date of the Shroud but not the earliest possible. \nFanti’s methods of dating depends on a systematic mechanical erosion of the cellulose over time. But there are other factors which can cause this erosion such as questions of handling, storage, folding, climate amongst others. Common with all man-made products from natural substances, there will also be considerable variability among specimens, an aspect familiar enough to all engineers. Fanti’s methods depends on an underlying assumption that time is the dominant factor. \nThe graphs he has prepared from fabrics with known dates have a considerable spread reflecting this variability, and there are also outliers.  The methods are novel, and in their early stages of development, and even drawn from a fairly limited population. More data is required to corroborate them further, and to obtain better fixes.  However they will only ever give probable limits because of the innate variability. Nevertheless they seem likely to be worthwhile, as a method of corroboration or as a flag to challenge other dating results. The disparate results from the various methods he has developed show that more refinement is necessary, and it may be that a combination of the methods is required to achieve any reliability. \nApplying the methods to dating of the Shroud requires that the subject samples chosen for dating are representative, and the samples he had available might therefore be challenged on this account. \nTo average out the results to obtain a magic date of 33AD might be seen as an abuse of the method verging on pseudo-science, and which is unnecessary towards obtaining a general acceptance of the techniques he has used, which remain in an early stage of development.\n\n","date":"March 25, 2014 at 4:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"More repetition ad nauseam changes nothing!\n\n","date":"March 27, 2014 at 5:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Eight out of the ten most recent comments at the present time have all been made by Yannick Clement under this particular posting. They all say exactly the same thing.  Does he imagine that such repetition makes his argument any more valid? It does not! He is entitled to his views on the matter, as others are to theirs. I for one do not accept his arguments. I am prepared to accept that he may very well be right that the Mandylion was not the Shroud, but I remain personally of the view that it very well may have been.  And I am entitled to hold this view as Yannick is entitled to hold the opposite. \nYannick, Charles and various academics may imagine that the Mandylion and Shroud were two different objects and speculate on alternative routes by which the Shroud may have come to Constantinople, but they are utterly unable to muster a smidgeon of evidence to support any case for any such alternative route. \nIt is too plainly evident that the 6th and 7th century iconography throughout Eastern Christianity has Shroud-like likenesses and features. It is known that these were frequently claimed to be based on the Image of Edessa, whatever that was. Futhermore it is also known that the original image, later called the Mandylion, only emerged in Edessa from about the year 540AD. To borrow an overworked favourite expression of Yannick’s “This speaks very loudly to me!” \nIn 943AD the Armenian general John Kurkuas on behalf of the Byzantine emperor swept through Mesopotamia with an army of 80,000 men conquering everything before him, and arrived at the gates of Edessa. We all know the startling offer he made. But he only wanted one thing, “Give us the Mandylion!” Generals on such a winning streak as Kurkuas had do not set out on an expedition for just any old painted icon.  Again “This speaks very loudly to me!” \nOn its eventual arrival in Constantinople, the future emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, describes the image in terms which seem very like that of the Shroud image ‘extremely faint, a moist secretion without pigment or painter’s art’; others saw it as blurred.  Once more, “This speaks very loudly to me!” \nNo other object in the history of the Byzantine imperial relic collection received any such celebratory reception as did Kurkuas’ delivery of the Edessan Mandylion in Constantinople! \nThis sequence of argument speaks louder I think than any notional interpretation of ancient texts such as the “Acts of Thaddeus” nor any of its later accretions. Hence it is at least equally valid to hold the view that the Mandylion and Shroud were one and the same object, as it is to hold an opposing view of the matter!\n\n","date":"March 27, 2014 at 4:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"David Goulet, Thomas: Two of the most interesting and informative papers on the Mandylion theory are by Jack Markwardt, particularly his “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” of 2008;\nhttp://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf  \nMarkwardt provides many ancient references associating the burial cloths with ancient liturgies. He makes a case for the Shroud being taken to Antioch in apostolic times, where it was hidden in a wall at the “Gates of the Cherubim” in 362AD and forgotten until its rediscovery there in about 540 and then taken to Edessa, prior to Antioch’s destruction by earthquake and Persian invasion. \nThe doctrine of Addai, purporting to be an exchange of letters between Abgar V and Jesus, he considers to be a coded allegory written at the behest of Abgar VIII the Great, commemorating the conversion of Edessa to Christianity during the closing decades of the 2nd century. The purpose of writing it as an allegory was that the benign emperor Commodus was succeeded by the despot Septimius Severus, when persecutions recommenced. He makes a case that Bishop Avircius of Hieropolis, was dispatched by Pope Eleutherius to baptize Abgar VIII’s household, that Avircius was granted temporary custody of the Shroud at Antioch as a kind of visual aid for his mission to Edessa, and later returned it to Antioch.  The Shroud’s later rediscovery in the walls of Antioch is echoed in the myth that it was discovered in the walls of Edessa during reconstruction after flood damage. \nThe temporary presence in Edessa is reflected in the “Hymn of the Pearl” attributed to the 2nd century Edessan hymnodist Bardaisan, who it would seem may have seen the full body image at the court of Edessa, judging from the closing verses of the hymn.  \nAs Thomas says, there remains ambiguity and greyness, but in my view Markwardt’s paper goes a long way to filling out the gaps, from the Wilson theory, as it would seem unlikely that Edessa became Christian as early as the apostolic age.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2014 at 3:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Following the stoning of Stephen, Herod Agrippa instituted a persecution of the apostolic church in Jerusalem, and many fled to Antioch. If the Shroud is indeed authentic then it had to be in the custody of the apostlic leadership and would also have been taken to Antioch, along with other relics of the Passion. In the year 70AD the city of Jerusalem was destroyed, and any surviving relics would not have been held there any longer. \nSo it is in Antioch that we must assume that the Shroud was taken, and unlikely ever to be held in Jerusalem subsequently. It is an error to place too much weight on the Doctrine of Addai, and the description of the portrait as a towel or veil. Eusebius discovered the story in the archives of Edessa about 315AD and incorporated it into his Ecclesiastical History. It refers to an exchange of letters between Abgar V Ukkama and Jesus. Eusebius incorrectly assumed that it was literally true. \nHowever the Doctrine of Addai also incorporates several subsequent accretions. For example it describes the finding of the true cross along with the crosses of the two thieves, ascribing the discovery to the wife of the emperor Tiberius, whereas the discovery is more properly attributed to Saint Helena the mother of Constantine, and who lived ~248 – 328 AD. Furthermore it describes the death of Addai and the erection of a memorial to him, which only occurred ~190AD. It is only too apparent that the “Acts of Thaddeus” is pseudonymous and was written probably not too long before Eusebius first discovered it. \nThe Image of Edessa first emerges there about the year 540AD, and was most likely taken there from Antioch with the impending destruction of the city by earthquake and by Persian invasion. \nIt can be no coincidence that very soon after the Image’s first apearance in Edessa ~540 that there is a veritable welter of icons all with Shroud-like features, and all ascribed to being copied from the Image of Edessa.  It is too improbable to assert that this Image of Edessa was different from the Shroud image for these likenesses to be so pervasive. \nI have suggested above at #61, from Markwardt’s explanation of the origins of the Doctrine of Addai, that it was intended as a coded allegory referring to the conversion of Abgar VIII ~180-190AD, when the image may have been used by Bishop Avercius to assist in this.  The Bardaisanic “Hymn of the Pearl” suggests that Bardaisan had indeed seen the full body image at the court of Abgar VIII.  Very likely the Shroud was returned to Antioch by Palut the first bishop of Edessa, rather than its being retained in Edessa. \nOn its eventual arrival in Constantinople, what was thought to be known of the Mandylion was written up in a lengthy Narratio including the Doctrine of Addai. Eventually the Byzantines discovered that the Mandylion which they had captured from Edessa was in fact the burial cloth of Christ. However they were not about to abandon the various legends attributed to it and which they had worked into their various liturgies. That would be unthinkable to the Byzantine mind-set. So the myth that there were two different objects survived. \nMuch of the early history of the Shroud has been lost as it was in the possession of the Arian heretics in Antioch for some time, and any documentation they may have had was destroyed by the Orthodox who were the ultimate victors.  \nIt is a gross error to read the Doctrine of Addai or the Acts of Thaddeus as a literal version of whatever the image was that was used for the conversion of the Edessan court, and certainly not for Abgar V Ukkama.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2014 at 6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/24/giulio-fanti-in-the-spotlight-and-a-crash-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Giulio Fanti in the Spotlight and a Crash Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"O.K: “While we can be certain to the high degree that Othon took possesion of the Shroud, it is possible that he, or his descendants entrusted the cloth to the Templars.”\nLouis: “O.K.

Geoffrey I de Charnay had a strong interest in knightly chivalry of the type practised by the Templars. It is just possible that the two Geoffreys were connected.\nIf Louis or O.K. are aware of any other information linking the Templars to the Shroud I should like to know of it. \nOthon de la Roche was an ancestor of Jeanne de Vergy, the second wife of Geoffrey I de Charnay, and therefore she could be considered to have a claim to the Shroud.\nScavone makes a case that Othon would have delivered the Shroud to his home cathedral at Besancon, then in Burgundy, possibly as early as 1207. Burgundy was contested both by France supporting the Avignon anti-pope, and by Germany supporting the Pope in Rome.  With Germany threatening to take Burgundy, a case can be made for Jeanne de Vergy taking the Shroud from Besancon to save it for France. I believe there may also have been a family connection with Pope Clement VII of Avignon. Soon afterwards, fire destroyed the St Stephen’s cathedral in Besancon. \nThere was a Shroud subsequently in Besancon showing a ventral image only, a copy of the genuine Shroud, and likely the basis of the D’Arcis false allegation that the Lirey Shroud was a painted copy. The Besancon shroud was later torn up for bandages.\nNote that the Lirey memorial badge shows not only the De Charnay arms, but also significantly the De Vergy arms, and that after the death of Geoffrey I, Jeanne de Vergy took possession of the Shroud as Geoffrey II was still a minor.  \nI suggest a reading of the Scavone paper so that it may be weighed against the Templar hypothesis.

Most of Nickel’s other arguments are answered by reference to Ian Wilson’s most recent book “The Shroud”, Random House, 2010. \nDespite Bishop D’Arcis’ most carefully worded letter of 1389 to Avignon Pope Clement VII, he was unable to provide a single documented reference supporting his charge that Bishop Henry of Troyes had looked into the matter “some 34 years ago or thereabouts” and found that it “had been cunningly painted”,  Note that he is even unspecific about the date, even though any supporting documentation would still have been available to him.  The truth of the matter is that very likely all the churchmen, Bishops Henry, D’Arcis and the Canons of Lirey, were all moved by avarice to meet their debts, as apart from the Shroud, they had missed out on the largesse of other relics seized from the sack of Constantinople.  Pope Clement VII may have known more about it than he let on.  He had a close connection with the de Charny family, and he enjoined D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication.  \nWe do not know the history of the Shroud, as its original owner in the West, the gallant and most honourable knight Geoffrey de Charny was killed at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 defending his king, before he was able to reveal how he came by it.  However Ian Wilson attempts a credible reconstruction of its history as the Mandylion of Edessa, and musters several sound arguments to support it.  This may not suit the pedants who insist only on facts, but it is the unavoidable vagueness of the history of those turbulent times.  That so much can be reconstructed is a credit to Wilson’s perseverance and energy. \nWilson also itemises several criticisms of the C14 tests, and describes the jostling for control between John Paul II’s chief scientific advisor Dr Carols Chagas and Turin’s Professor Luigi Gonella.  Chagas’ well thought-out protocol was scrapped, and Gonella and the AMS laboratories had their way.  Without even touching on the likelihood that the C14 sample was a patch, and not the original material at all, Wilson lists the following criticisms:- \n1. Choosing only of labs using the AMS method, all three being clones of one another;\n2.  No involvement of a professional textile conservator in choosing the sample;\n3, Taking just one single sample, from one single area;\n4.  Choice of site for the sample being well-documented as subject to prolonged repeated handling during the centuries;\n5.  No provision for any chemical analysis of the sample;\n6.  Unofficial purloining by Gonella and Riggi of unused portions of the sample for their own personal research purposes;\n7.  Denial of any other synchronous scientific approaches to the Shroud. \nNevertheless, no amount of logical argument will change the minds of the skeptics.  They have made up their closed minds on the issue.  And still retain the gall to call themselves scientists.  Maybe they’d make good lab technicians, and not attempt to be more ambitious.\n\n","date":"January 26, 2012 at 5:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/25/correcting-joe-nickell/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Correcting Joe Nickell"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I believe Hugh is correct in his interpretation of the meaning of “pareidolia”.  It seems to be a fairly recent word that has come into the language.  My Collins of about 1990 does not include it, nor is there an entry in my Encyc Brit of 2006.  My Collins does include the word “eidolon” from the parent Greek, – “1. an unsubstantial image; apparition; phantom; 2. an ideal or idealized figure  [C19 from Greek; phantom, IDOL]  On-line Collins gives the following meaning for pareidolia: “the imagined perception of a pattern or meaning where it does not actually exist, as in considering the moon to have human features”  \nIt would be a wrong use of the word to apply it to a published photograph of an easily recognisable scene or person, and yet the photograph would almost inevitably be made up of a series of closely spaced dots which the eye resolves as a clear pattern, as a result of an artifact of the printing process.  An ink-jet printer in fact produces a similar result but on a much finer resolution.  This is fairly close to what we see on the Shroud image.  However to see writing on the Shroud as some have asserted, would quite likely be a true pareidolia, if in fact the writing was not truly there.  The reports of a face on the surface of Mars resulting from mountain shadows is clearly a case of pareidolia.  But merely because the eye is capable of resolving a series of dots into a coherent image is not sufficient for the image to be classified as a pareidolia, if in fact it is a true representation of an objective reality.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2015 at 4:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/25/a-critical-summary-3-0-discussion-one-very-smart-bartender/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"A Critical Summary 3.0 Discussion:  One Very Smart Bartender"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The Spicer hypothesis that image formation may be related to an electric field intrigues me.

Certainly there are several occasions since 1355 when the Shroud was frequently displayed in this way and there are several illustrations of this type of depiction.  For those Eurocentrics who believe that it only dates from the 14th century, I suppose “always” is close enough.  For those who for various reasons believe that it dates from antiquity it most definitely is not.  \nWe have the evidence of Robert de Clari and Nicholas Mesarites both claiming to have seen an upright image of Christ in connection with burial linens in Constantinople.  Mesarites description of “rising again” implies some kind of mechanism was used for the purpose.  The Byzantines were not only competent engineers from ancient times but also ingenious, and were quite capable of producing such a visual display to full dramatic effect.  \nVern Miller produced photographs under raking light during the STURP investigations.  Several fold-marks across the cloth are clearly visible under these lighting conditions.  Very likely many of the folds arise from various ways of storing the cloth during its long history.  Sadly the folds are no longer visible because of the 2002 interference with the integrity of the original.  \nJohn Jackson has his own particular take on it and maintains that there are definite folds which correspond with the claimed tetradiplon pattern.

In the first place to use any word that has any meaning at all, such as the term “resurrection” you must first have a definition of what you mean by that, and so we have at least the beginnings of some explanation.  We also have the witnesses of the New Testament who pretty well corroborate one another as what they perceived as the “resurrected Christ”.   They all perceived him as having at least some transient corporeality;  he walked, spoke intelligently with them, they were able to touch him and feel the wounds of his crucifixion, he ate and even prepared a fish breakfast for them.  However there is also something mysterious about this corporeality, as it seems he was able to pass through the walls of the upper room where they were hiding, and he could suddenly appear and likewise vanish from their sight, as if into another kind of dimension.  So although we can have some understanding of what a resurrected body might be, I can agree that there are clearly natural limits to that understanding, as it is beyond any experience familiar to us. \nThe other flaw I see in your logic is “begging the question”.  You make a conditional statement that “if the Shroud image was created by the resurrection”, and then seem to assume that is necessarily true, which although it might be true, is not necessarily the case at all, as even assuming that the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth, you are unable to exclude a natural cause of the image.  The fact that a natural cause is as yet unknown, still cannot exclude that possibility.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2015 at 4:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/26/dan-spicer-we-have-a-simple-explanation/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Dan Spicer:  We have a simple explanation."},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Although Edessa was nominally part of the Byzantine empire, the Edessans were more oriented towards a Syriac tradition and somewhat resented their Byzantine subjection.

Two other very similar images are the St Catherine’s Pantocrator and the Homs vase, all three distinctive as showing an upper body image, all from the first reign of Justinian II, and quite unlike any Edessan-based Mandylion image which more often usually terminate at the neck-line.  \nMarkwardt interprets the change in the post-exilic solidi to a younger beardless Christ as a result of Byzantine superstition.  Was it appropriate to use the “Image of God Incarnate” in this way?  Justinian did not have long to wait for his answer.  Overthrown, having his nose cut off, and sent into exile, he interpreted the defeat as a sign of divine disapproval of this use of the image.  Consequently when he was eventually reinstated the coin imagery was changed to an idealised youthful and beardless Christ.  \nIt is apparent that the Shroud image was known in Constantinople during Justinian’s reign, and in all likelihood was already there.  At this time the Mandylion was still in Edessa, but it was Ian Wilson’s contention that its purported full-length image did not become known until after it arrived in Constantinople in 945.  The weakness in the Wilson argument then becomes apparent.  The Shroud was never the Mandylion.  Even Mark Guscin in his PhD thesis seems to become confused by the prevalence of face-only images and reports of a pre-945 full-body image.  The two images are evidently quite distinctive from each other.  \nit is also Markwardt’s contention based on the Tarragon manuscript, that following a series of continuous earthquakes during the mid-8th century in Constantinople, the Shroud was hidden away in the imperial palace, only to be revealed by a later emperor Alexios around 1200.

This water stain damage is discussed in some detail in Ch 6 of Ian Wilson’s 2010 boook.  He was able to write authoritatively on this feature as he was involved in a TV demonstration with Italian photographer Aldo Guerreschi who had photographed the stains identified during Dr Flury-Lemburg’s 2002 restoration work.  The repetitive pattern of the stains shows that they occurred when the cloth was loosely folded accordion style into some 52 segments making a bundle roughly 12 inches by 13 inches.  It had to be in some kind of container to hold this arrangement. Flury-Lemburg and Guerreschi thought an earthenware jar the most likely as other similar ancient articles had been found so stored.  A reasonable explanation is that the staining was caused by a puddle of water in the bottom of the jar, possibly as a result of condensation.  The TV demonstration replicated this water-staining damage.  \nIn the same Chapter 6 Wilson also mentions the folding implied by the well-know four sets of the “triple poker hole” patterns.  The cloth then had to be folded in four making a package roughly 7 feet by 2 feet.  An artist’s copy of the Shroud datd 1516 shows these holes, which were therefore unrelated to the 1532 fire.  They also seem to be suggested in the Hungarian Pray manuscript of 1195. \nIt would therefore seem that the writer of the comment has confused the two incidents – the water staining and the poker holes.  It seems credible that the water-staining may have occurred during the Shroud’s very early Middle East history, as other artifacts have been found so stored.  Alternatively it may even have occurred during one of its frequent post-1355 peregrinations around central Europe (France-Italy-Swiss Alps).  Check Wilson’s 2010 “The Shroud” for a fuller description.  I would doubt that the water staining damage was ever shown in any pre-1532 drawing without some specific reference to it.\n\n","date":"January 30, 2013 at 6:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/29/paper-chase-new-the-shroud-a-critical-summary-of-observations-data-and-hypotheses/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase (NEW): The Shroud: A Critical Summary of Observations, Data and Hypotheses"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The question of the removal of fold marks during the 2002 intervention seems ambiguous and enigmatic.  I found two seemingly contradictory papers on the Shroud.com site.  [Search word was ‘Restoration’ yielding several links and titles of papers]  \nA summary of the Dallas conference yielded a series of Q&A dealt with by Mme Flury-Lemburg concerning her intervention.  She asserted there had been no ironing, nor laundering, nor steam cleaning, nor the use of weights to remove wrinkles; a weight had been used merely to keep a glass cover in place during the work.  \nConversely a paper: “SHROUD RESTORATION DATA”  First published in LINTEUM, the Spanish Centre for Sindonology magazine, 2002.  http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n58part7.pdf includes the following:-\n“Aims: [includes –>]  ** Remove the organic remains, dust and dirt that had accumulated between the Shroud and the backing cloth;  ** Stretch the Shroud to iron out crease marks”\n“Effects: [includes –>]  **Crease marks have been taken out with a system consisting of small lead weights.  The Shroud has thus “grown”, and now measures 441.5 x 113.7 cm” \nThe two papers therefore seem to be mutually contradictory concerning the removal of crease marks.  I did not search for further information for corroboration one way or the other. \nDuring its history, it is evident that the Shroud has been kept for long periods of time folded or rolled in various ways.  This is evident from repeated / symmetrical patterns of water stains, the ‘poker hole’ pattern, the Chambery 1532 burn holes, and in recent centuries by being rolled on a baton or staff.  \nIn 2004, Aldo Guerreschi simulated a folding indicated by the ancient water stains.  The simulation was broadcast on British Television in presence of Ian Wilson who describes it in his 2010 book.  The cloth was folded twice lengthwise and then with 12 loose folds widthwise accordian style and placed in a replica of a jar used for storing the Dead Sea scrolls.  Guesrreschi succeeded in obtaining an identical pattern of water stains. \nThe poker hole pattern indicates that at this time it was folded with one fold lengthwise and one widthwise.  The Chambery burn holes indicate it was at that time folded once lengthwise and also widthwise to produce two symmetrical rows each of four holes.  In recent centuries it has been rolled on its staff.  In addition we have Wilson’s tetradiplon theory so folded to produce a landscape face.  There may have been other long term foldings which are now unknown.  Perhaps it was folded in particular ways for Byzantine displays as suggested by Jackson, or even storage in a casket.  \nThe retention of fold marks is said to occur because of the breakdown of the linen cellulose crystalline structure.  I suggest that this breakdown will not necessarily be as uniform as it might be in a modern machine-made product.  There will be variations in thread strength and texture resulting from hand-spinning and hand-loom weaving.  Perhaps it cannot be expected that residual fold marks will be clean straight lines across the cloth, but will pursue the line of least resistance determined by its hand-made heterogeneity, previous foldings, and such factors as edge distance discontinuities.  It would seem unlikely that the folds were ever ironed or pressed into place for permanence.\nJackson has attempted to rediscover the ancient methods used for folding, and each of us will have our own views of how successful or uncertain these might be.  Whatever, with the apparent, or at least possible, removal of wrinkling in 2002, any rediscovery or review of this work would seem to be a forlorn hope.\n\n","date":"October 20, 2014 at 11:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/20/quick-reaction-to-in-the-belly-of-the-beast/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Quick Reaction to In the Belly of the Beast"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Or was it “I think I see”??

A contemporary engineer and resourceful inventor, Heron of Alexandria had created a device giving the illusion of turning water into wine.

We admit to some surprise that the high quality linen cloth you ordered should be cut to exactly 8 x 2 old Assyrian cubits, as these went out of fashion some centuries ago around about the time that Sultan Mu’awiyah, blessed be his name, delivered the city out of the hand of the infidel, we believe in the year 661 according to your own system of reckoning.    \nWe are mystified at your demand for such a high level of purity in the linen thread, to be absolutely free from cotton.  You must be aware that multi-tasking is an essential economic necessity in these straitened times, and we expect our spinners to be adept at all fibres. Consequently all our fibres are heaped around our work-rooms, float about in the air and can generally get quite mixed up. It wasn’t always like this, but we believe there are some excellent compensating “spin-offs”, if you’ll forgive our little pun. \nWe note your requirements for certain botanical contaminations from specific geographical areas.  We are on good terms with our brethren in Anatolia who can arrange for the necessary exposures during the appropriate seasons, but would caution you concerning the prohibitive cost of this little indulgence.  We cannot however recommend sending the cloth to the Dead Sea Area at this time of year, as our brothers the Mamluks and Abbasids are presently engaged in what may politely be called duck-shooting activities, and we would fear for the safety of our couriers and of your order.  We are not at all certain whether in fact the plants you refer to, are any longer extent in the area.  It is now a fairly barren kind of place. \nThe most perplexing item of your specification  seems to relate to some peculiar geology requirement we have never heard of. What in fact is this travertine aragonite limestone of which you speak?  And just why do you want to contaminate our lovely linen products with such unspeakable dirt, even if it is from off the streets of the blessed city?  What are you? Some kind of nut? \nOur public librarian claims to have sighted a record of a similar kind of order as yours, but it was well over a millenium ago.  He believes it was requested by Joe someone, he thinks it looked like Harry Matthews, or maybe ‘Arry-Matthis or some-such. \nMay we interest you in purchasing some fine Persian carpets instead.

I still await some confirmation that the flexed thumb suggestion is not a myth.”\nRigor mortis is irrelevant in this case, as flexure occurs immediately on nailing.  Whether the muscles relaxing after death would make any difference, so that the palms are merely hiding the thumbs in a natural position, the fact remains that Barbet demonstrates that the flexure definitely occurs, and his attributing it to damage to the median nerve seems credible as his amputated arms were fresh. \nOne might speculate a severe case of psychosis scrupulus dubitationis scepticissimi.\nThe following extracts from Barbet, or better still read the full original, or else merely jump to the last three paragraphs.  If experimenting, it is important to use freshly amputated arms immediately! \nBarbet:\n“I did not appreciate the importance of all this till I had made the following experiment: having amputated an arm two-thirds of the way up, I took, immediately after the operation, a square nail with sides of 1/3 of an inch (like those of the Passion), the length of which I had reduced to 2 inches for convenience of radiography.  The hand was laid flat with its back on a plank, and I placed the point of the nail in the middle of the bending fold of the wrist, the nail being vertical.  Then with a large hammer, I hit the nail, as an executioner would do who knew how to hit hard.” \n“I repeated the same experiment with several men’s hands (the first had belonged to a woman) .  Each time I observed exactly the same thing.  Once it had passed through the soft parts, and the nail had entered fully into the wrist, I could feel it, in spite of my left hand holding it firmly, moving a little obliquely, so that the base was leaing towards the fingers, the point towards the elbow;  it then emerged through the skin of the back of the wrist at about a centimetre above the point of entry, which I observed after removing the nail from the plank.  Radiographs were taken at once.  I had thought, a priori, that the nail would dig deep into the wrist, and would probably pass through the semi-lunar bone, crushing it on its way.  The movements of the nail while it was sinking had, however, made me suspect that it had found a more anatomical path.” \n“In fact, in the radiograph taken in profile, the nail, which is a little bit oblique, in a backwards and upwards direction, passes between the projections of the semi-lunar and of the capitate, which remain intact. The radiograph taken from the front is even more interesting;  the shadow of the square nail appears to be rectangular, on account of its obliquity.  The nail has entered into Destot’s space, it has moved aside the four bones which surround it without breaking one of them, merely widening the space.” \n“The dissection of the hand confirmed my radiographic results.  The point of entry, being a little outside and medial to Destot’s space, the point of the nail reached the head of the great bone, slid along its mesial slope, went down into the space, and crossed it.  The four bones were pushed aside, but were intact and by reason of thus being pushed were closely pressed against the nail.  Elsewhere the latter was resting on the upper end of the transverse carpal ligament.  (Etc). …” \n“I have in fact repeated this experiment a dozen times since then on the hand of an arm which has just been amputated, moving the point of entry all round the middle of the bending fold.  In each case the point took up its own direction and seemed to be slipping along the walls of a funnel and then to find its way spontaneously into the space which was awaiting it.  (Etc) …”  \n“But these experiments had yet another surprise for me.  I have stressed the point that I was operating on hands which still had life in them immediately after the amputation of the arm.  Now, I observed on the first occasion, and regularly from then onwards, that at the moment when the nail went through the soft anterior parts, the palm being upwards, the thumb would bend sharply and would be exactly facing the palm by the contraction of the themar muscles, while the four fingers would bend very slightly; this was probably caused by the reflex mechanical stimulation of the long flexor tendons.” \n“Now dissections have revealed to me that the trunk of the median nerve is always seriously injured by the nail;  it is divided into sections, being broken sometimes half-way and sometimes two-thirds of the way across, according to the case.  And the motor nerves of the opponens muscles and of the short flexor muscle of the thumb branches at this level off the median nerve.  The contraction of these themar muscles, which were still living like their motor nerve, could be easily explained by the mechanical stimulation of the median nerve.

My reading of Barbet is that it is mere hammering of the nail into the wrist through the Destot space, which Barbet claims results in damage to the median nerve, thus stimulating thumb flexure.  I do not recall that Barbet discusses the median nerve in connection with breathing efforts, which is the phenomenon challenged by Zugibe.  Perhaps David Mo’s distaste of such clinical details, has resulted in some confusion.  \nA few paragraphs towards the end of his discussion concerning the hands, Barbet does state the following:\n“But, alas, the median nerves are not merely the motor nerves, they are also the great sensory nerves.  When they were injured and stretched out on the nails, in those extended arms, … they must have caused the most horrible pain. (etc)” \nThe gospels indicate that death occurred within three hours of Christ being crucified, and this brevity of time surprised Pilate.

Barbet was not to my knowledge an ophthalmologist but an extremely experienced forensic pathologist.  Regardless of whether a person on this site is an ophthalmologist or not, I should assume that if he can affix the initials MD after his name, he knows rather more about anatomy than one who is unable to stand the site of gore.  \nZugibe’s scenario appears too contrived to me.  He has a volunteer step up to a simulated cross and binds his hands into gauntlets fitted with strain gauges and binds his feet.  On that basis he claims that arm tensions do not exceed 67 lbs as against Barbet’s 207 lbs. He does not appear to have considered the mechanics of the actual process involved in crucifixion.  The most efficient way a Roman soldier might be expected to direct this operation, would be to nail the prisoners arms on the cross-beam while lying on the ground, and then a squad of no more than 5 soldiers can lift the beam on to the upright (stipes).  During this procedure the full weight of the body is taken by the arms, and it matters not if the feet are nailed subsequently, the arms have had to bear a tension of about 207 lbs each as correctly calculated by Barbet.  Hence wrist nailing would be required.  A scenario of requiring the binding of the prisoner to an upright cross, and nailing his arms to the cross-beam in situ presumably requiring the assistance of ladders, sounds altogether too clumsy and unreliable.  To obtain Zugibe’s figures requires the body to be supported by some unknown means (soldiers?, pedestal? ropes?) until such time as the feet are nailed.  \nI interpret Anoxie’s claims that because the amputated arms of Barbet were severed from the central nervous system, that damage to the median nerve could not have caused the thumb retractions observed by Barbet, and that therefore his interpretation of that being the cause is faulty.  I should like to be more persuaded about this point.  Barbet is careful to say that his nailing occurred immediately after amputation, claiming that there was still life in the arms(?).  Is it not possible for the nerve cells to respond to such a stimulus in that situation, i.e. as soon as they are severed from the central nervous system?  I should like a professionally competent based response to that question.\n\n","date":"July 30, 2015 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Attempting to hammer an 8 mm thick square nail into a man’s arm to near the end of an unbraced cantilevered cross-beam which is supported only at its mid-point, while standing on a ladder leaning against the cross-beam would be a rather hazardous and clumsy way of doing the job.  The cross-beam would tend to pivot on its central support, would vibrate and offer a most unsatisfactory surface for hammering.  Far better to lay the cross-beam on the ground where it can offer proper resistance, and hammer the nails in there.  Ask any friendly builder.  I have known research workers who did all their correct scientific calculations, but failed to take into account the basic engineering requirements of their project, occasionally with near-tragic results.

However in the case of the Shroud, the presence of vanillin in the Raes area would almost certainly indicate that repairs were carried out there post-1532, especially if the fire had eliminated vanillin in the original cloth.  This would seem to be a most important conclusion. I think we can forget the Jackson hypothesis on CO contamination skewing the C-14 results.

I note a comment in Stephen Jones’ posting that the limestone was only found under the right foot.  This is inexact. It was also found on a knee-cap and the nose, as if from a fall, prompting John Klotz to recount a story, being tripped up by his dog ‘Bogie’ with the result that John actually fell on his nose and his knee-cap, an unduly extreme form of dedicated corroboration.  ‘Gabriel’ has often mentioned that the published paper on the limestone lacked peer-review and attempts should be made to confirm the results.  It has also been suggested that the strontium impurity if quantitatively measured should prove an excellent indicator of geographical provenance.  The issue clearly needs revisiting. \nWe also discussed the poker holes in Dan’s posting of February 25, when Stephen first commenced his Part 2.6, which it seems draws heavily on some of Ian Wilson’s commentary, although it has seemed sensible for Stephen not to have accepted the incident reported by Arculf as their cause. There are a number of possible scenarios. One such is that at some early stage the Shroud may have been used as a folded altar cloth and damaged by grains of burning incense.  Certain ancient eucharistic rites mention that altar cloths are to be so viewed as being the sindon of the Lord.  Another possible scenario is that it may have been subjected to an unknown trial by fire, as I mentioned in a comment on the Feb 25 posting, arising from another comment by Wilson. \nWilson’s other source is an Arabic document found in Egypt referring to a trial of the “Image of Edessa”: “Hail Abgar, who was worthy to behold the image of the Lord made without ink on cloth, the image of the worker of miracles. It was not effaced or burnt when it was tested by fire and water before the great multitude.” This may well have been some otherwise unknown trial.  However in view of the reference to Abgar, there is a problem here identifying this implicit test as causing the poker holes which obviously happened when the Shroud was folded into four layers. (A) Four layers doesn’t fit with Wilson’s theory of tetradiplon. (B) If this test did cause the poker holes, it is an extremely rare reference to an occasion when the Shroud was folded in this way. The Arabic document does imply a practice of subjecting such objects to trials by ordeal, and perhaps this did happen to the Shroud cloth at some unknown time. Or perhaps we should just accept that the holes may have been caused by some mere mishap such as burning incense.\n\n","date":"March 23, 2013 at 8:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/23/stephen-jones-adds-another-part-to-his-series/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Stephen Jones adds another part to his series"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“I  told Dan and his commenters that the Holy Spirit had been prompting me to warn both them and Dan that they who personally attack me, a Christian who is only seeking to serve his Lord, that Jesus will, if they don’t repent, avenge their attacks on me.”\n“I strongly believe that Jesus is going before me in this and that He will progressively reveal what REALLY happened in the C-14 dating of His Shroud.”\nIt is easy to fall into the trap that one is the spokesperson for Jesus.

Dare one mention the horrors committed by the western Crusaders against their orthodox brethren in the east, the methods of the Spanish inquisitors, the horrors perpetrated by both Elizabethan and Jacobite persecutors against those they disagreed with.

An obvious one is that he will have to deal with the description of the cloths found in the tomb. Mr Hamon has from time to time mentioned a few other more obscure indications. Are there suggestions or secret indications of the Shroud in various obscure references to linen, apparel and so on? Why did Mary Magdalen mistake the resurrected Christ for the gardener – was it because he wore a himation like a gardener, in reality the Shroud? What is behind the vision of the large cloth that Peter sees descending from heaven – is this an obscure reference to it?

There are a number of very early references that altar cloths were to be considered as the burial cloth of Christ (I can chase these references if wanted).  Possibly there may have been occasion(s) when the Shroud was actually used as such. \nWilson’s hypothesis that they may have occurred as a “trial by fire” is described in Ch 11 of his “The Shroud” 2010. The trial was reported by Bishop Arculf (check internet on Bishop Arculf). Two competing groups in Edessa were claiming the cloth, The report claims that the Sultan cast the cloth towards the fire, the cloth floated over it and then drifted towards one of the claimant groups, “the believers”.  Wilson also mentions another separate source which also refers to a “trial by fire and water”.  Wilson notes that the use of a hot poker was a common means of “trial by fire”. \nThe separate source is an Arabic document found in Egypt referring to a trial of the “Image of Edessa”: “Hail Abgar, who was worthy to behold the image of the Lord made without ink on cloth, the image of the worker of miracles. It was not effaced or burnt when it was tested by fire and water before the great multitude.” This may well have been some otherwise unknown trial. \nThere are problems with the Wilson hypothesis: (1) It is second-hand reporting based on Arculf’s oral report of his perception to Abbott Adamnan of Iona, and recorded in Venerable Bede;  (2) The event occurred in Jerusalem, but explained by being temporarily housed there during post-earthquake rebuilding in Edessa; (3) Arculf reports the cloth as being about 8 feet long which can only be the Shroud if it was folded in two; (4) Arculf does not report an image on the cloth; (5)The cloth may have been an outer burial cloth, possibly used for transporting the body from the cross to the tomb; (6) One needs to read past the legendary elements to the story; (7) The event occurred about 679 AD, which argues against Wilson’s Mandylion hypothesis. when it was still supposed to be hidden in its frame.

In modern times we might see the outcome as a random event, but in ancient times such outcomes were seen as an expression of divine will.  Even in late medieval times in Europe those suspected of being witches were subject to various ordeals to test innocence or guilt.  \nI am coming to the view that the event reported by Arculf may have referred to an outer burial cloth, possibly used for transporting the body from the cross to the tomb.

The names of the Commission are now a matter of record, but they did include Professor Curto an expert on textiles and an agnostic, later replaced by Professor Gilbert Raes of Ghent, who was granted some significant samples.  It also included Noemi Gabrielli an art director, presumably knowledgeable on matters of art.  Conclusions of this Commission were quite indefinite.  The best they came up with was a set of recommendations for further testing, and that no fraudulent substance had been detected, and the results of the sticky-tape pollen sampling by Max Frei.  Attempts to analyse the bloodstain samples were quite fruitless, and had to await the later investigations by the STURP specialists.  \nThe imaging specialist on the later STURP team was Barrie Schwortz.  As well there were those with X-ray equipment, and various other radiant equipment, UV and IR.  The initial ignorance concerning the true nature of the image can be gleaned from Barrie’s later comments, that he imagined he was getting a free trip to Turin, discover that the image had been painted, he would see the sights, and return home.  And of course that is not how things turned out at all.  Even loose cannon Walter McCrone maintained to his dying day that the image had been painted.  That was the extent of the ignorance concerning the nature of the image in 1978.  It was only when STURP examined the cloth by back-lighting so that only the bloodstains remained visible, and when X-ray plates determined the absence of any heavy minerals, that painting could be conclusively excluded.  \nThe STURP project was carried out under tight constraints and protocols, not merely in time, only 72 hours being granted, but also the requirement of prior approval for their experimental programme.  There was therefore only limited opportunity for extending this predefined scope as a result of any fortuitous or serendipitous discovery during the project.\nIt may be true that the reasons for the image negativity with its left-right and light-dark reversals, because of the type of imaging process inherent in whatever process caused the image, whether by contact or other, was not understood and had not taken root.

It may even be that repairs were carried out in different parts of the cloth, by different persons and at different times.  \nThe 2005 Benford-Marino paper may illuminate this.  The authors mention their interview with Mr Michael Ehrlich of the firm “Without A Trace” in Chicago.  Ehrlich confirmed that the modern time-saving method of “Inweaving” would be invisible from the front, but easily recognisable from the back as claimed by Flury-Lemburg.  This seems to be the reason why she dismissed the possibility of “Invisible weaving”.  Frau F-L is one of the few persons who have inspected the back of the cloth, and of course there is no sign of the “Inweaving” which she would assert would be visible there.  This would seem to be the principle reason why she is so frequently quoted as claiming that there is no invisible weaving. \nThe B-M paper continues:  “However, the technique used in 16th Century Europe, called “French Weaving,” is an altogether different technique from Inweaving.”  It results in both front and back side “invisibility.” but nowadays is only done on small-scale repairs because of time and cost.  “According to Mr. Ehrlich, French Weaving involves a tedious thread-by -thread restoration that is undetectable.”  The paper gives arguments why it seems very likely that French Weaving was the method used.  \nBut that is not all!  The authors provide a reference by Professor Piero Savarino, later scientific advisor to Cardinal Poletto:  In his 1998 booklet, he stated that the 1988 C-14 testing might have been erroneous due to “extraneous thread left over from ‘invisible mending’ routinely carried out in the past on parts of the cloth in poor repair”.  Thus it seems likely that “invisible mending” was regarded as maintenance work routinely carried out!  Hence this raises the likelihood that there are other parts of the cloth which may well have cotton contamination, along with the mordants, dyes and other substances used in such work.  In other words, just not the area from the Raes sample.    \nConsidering the difficulties there have been in discerning the contamination in the Raes area, and its implications for the 1988  testing, this raises the possibility that any such future testing would require intense scrutiny of the samples to ensure that they also were not from areas subject to such repairs.  This might well prove extremely difficult, as it seems to be only discernible by teasing the threads apart.  \nAs to who carried out such work Benford and Marino believe it was done under Savoy Duchess Margaret of Austria in the 16th century.  But it might well be that similar work was also carried out by Sebastian Valfre in 1694, and also by Princess Clotilde in 1868-69.  \nOther possible sources of minor cotton contamination could include loom remnants from a previous weave, apparently postulated by Raes, and also from the variety of cotton gloves used by the STURP team in 1978.  It is known that the STURP team did examine various areas of the cloth under the microscope in attempts to discern cotton, but apparently found none.  However in view of Mr Ehrlich’s comments that the work was invisible from the surface, this may not signify a great deal.  It appears necessary to tease the threads apart in order to discern it.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2014 at 7:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks Max.

If one can take the inference from the Piero Savarino ref, and the plenitude of weavers skilled in the art who were available during the period 16th – 19th centuries, there might well be more areas of the cloth which were so repaired by various others.  \nRegarding Hugh’s comment that such repairs are readily visible under the microscope and that (weaving) inconsistencies frequently appear on the cloth, my understanding is that STURP searched for cotton in other areas by microscope, but were unable to identify any at that time.  So it seems to be yet another enigmatic aspect of the cloth.  It seems that nothing should be assumed if whenever any further samples might be taken for testing.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2014 at 4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"\nMax Patrick Hamon :Actually in “the Gospel of Mark” the Aramaic is Peter’s not Mark’s…\nI couldn’t disagree with that comment.\n\n","date":"August 22, 2012 at 4:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/21/another-review-of-thomas-de-wesselows-the-sign/","cat":"books","title":"Another Review of Thomas de Wesselow’s “The Sign”"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I fall back on John P Meier’s precept: “What can be gratuitously asserted, can be gratuitously denied!”  The absence of a wife in the gospels points strongly to the likelihood that Jesus remained celibate.

This is evident for example in describing Jesus’ trade as a woodworker.  A similar trend is evident in describing his family relationships.  Here are my notes on his brothers:\n“Meier discusses the fourth century doctrines of Mary’s perpetual virginity, but considers that the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus mentioned in the gospels are in fact blood-brothers or sisters of Jesus – he refers to the typical use of the Greek word ‘adelphos’ (brother or half-brother) rather than other terms (e.g. ‘anepsios’) in common use for relationships such as cousin or step-brother – thus he rejects Jerome’s and other patristic interpretations of these relationships. ”   In view of the legal status of adoptees, I think it may be inferred that the word used for “brother” might also include these.  \nA summary extract on his virginal conception:\n“The tradition that Jesus was virginally conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit is also affirmed in both Infancy Narratives.  The truth of the claim, which was hardly verifiable even when Jesus appeared on the public stage as an adult, is a fortiori not open to verification today.  Decisions on this tradition, limited within the NT to the Infancy Narratives, will largely be made on the basis of one’s philosophical views about the miraculous and the weight one gives to later Church teaching.”\n“In any case, the precise origins of the virginal conception tradition remain obscure from a historical point of view. A counter-tradition that Jesus was illegitimate is not clearly attested until close to the 2d century AD; it is most likely a mocking, polemical reaction to the claims of the Infancy Narratives, perhaps as filtered through popular disputes.” \nExtract on his marital status:\n“In the face of all this information about members of Jesus’ family, the total silence about a wife or children is best taken as indicating that Jesus chose the highly unusual – but not unknown – path of celibacy.”  \nIn view of Meier’s rigorously conservative approach to his analysis of the material (i.e. any speculation is absolutely minimal) I feel that his analysis is probably the best we are ever likely to derive on the historical Jesus, until any new evidence might come to light,\n\n","date":"August 21, 2012 at 4:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/21/another-review-of-thomas-de-wesselows-the-sign/","cat":"books","title":"Another Review of Thomas de Wesselow’s “The Sign”"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If the gospels were ever originally written in Aramaic, we have no way of knowing what the original word for ‘brother’ used in these drafts was, as we only have the Greek.

The Western consensus seems to be that the evangelists wrote in Greek, with various degrees of literary competence in the koine, e.g. it is said that Mark’s Greek is a bit rough, whereas Luke’s is more literary.  Although Aramaic is likely to have been the native tongue of two of the Synoptic evangelists (Matthew and Mark), Greek was more the lingua franca throughout all of the eastern empire.  If there was a desire that these works be read in the churches, then Greek would likely be the language in which they would be set down.

I think the value of Occam’s razor in this case is that it can now be argued a) firstly, that the “simplest solution is that the image was caused by some as yet unknown means from shrouding a corpse, and that this occurred before corruption commenced”; b) secondly, that the “simplest solution as to the identity of the corpse is that it was Jesus Christ, who as it happens is the only person who ever claimed to have survived death”; c) thirdly, that the “simplest solution of there no longer being any body present with no sign of manual removal, and no other known place of burial, that the said claims of Jesus Christ, for which there is testamentary evidence, is that they are VERY LIKELY to be true”! I think this is the strict logic of the case and the appropriate use of Occam’s razor. Ultimately, however, as such a claim is outside normal human experience, and it is just possible to conjecture that the body was in fact deliberately removed, the truth of the Resurrection can only be accepted as a Faith decision. The Shroud image is a persuasive but not strictly conclusive argument which can support that Faith decision. The steps (a) through (c) is I think the appropriate use of Occam’s razor. It is not necessary to argue that the image was caused by the Resurrection event itself, for it to be a sign of the Resurrection, whether it was so caused or not. The gap in de Wesselow’s argument is that it does not adequately explain the disappearance of the body, nor who may have removed it, nor for what purpose, nor does it explain who removed the boulder blocking the entrance to the tomb. Clearly the authorities intended that the body remain in the tomb, and the gospel accounts record that the first witnesses did not really expect such an event as the Resurrection, and were in fact slow to accept it.

However there are very few crucifixion nails available, as they were highly prized by the soldiery as some kind of curative talisman.  However there is at least one other nailed crucifixion victim known as a nail was stuck in his ankle bones.  This man had apparently been wrist-nailed.\nThe only gospel reference that informs us that Jesus was fastened by nailing is John 20:25-28, referring to doubting Thomas “Unless I see the holes that the nails made in his hands …”, there seems to be no other gospel reference to the method used  The Greek word for hands transliterates as “kefir’s” which any Gk dictionary translates as “hands”.  However, in Acts 12:8 describing Peter’s miraculous delivery from prison, the same word “kefir’s” is used (.. the chains fell from his hands …).  It is unthinkable that the chains bound only his palms, and three of the four modern translations have “the chains fell from his wrists”.  Evidently the word includes the wrist area.\nI have been unable to drop onto a Latin Vulgate version, but I rather suspect that Jerome translated kefir’s as ‘manus’ rather than ‘carpus’ (= wrist).\nConsequently generations of artists show Jesus as being nailed in the palms, an impossible means of effectively suspending the weight of the body.  Many depictions get around this “suspension of disbelief” by showing him standing comfortably on a little pedestal, which stretches artistic licence a little bit too freely. \n“2.

It is true that I prefer well-established reputable authorities in drawing on my references rather than what might happen to be the current flavour of the month.   \nRe Matthew’s gospel:\nMatthew is the first in order of the four canonical Gospels and is often called the “ecclesiastical” Gospel, both because it was much used for selections for pericopes for the church year and because it deals to a great extent with the life and conduct of the church and its members.  \nThe Gospel grew out of a “school” led by a man with considerable knowledge of Jewish ways of teaching and interpretation. This is suggested by the many ways in which Matthew is related to Judaism. It is in some ways the most “Jewish” Gospel. Striking are 11 “formula quotations” (“This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet . . .”) claiming the fulfilment of Old Testament messianic prophecies. \nConcerning the Matthean Church:\nMatthew is not only an original Greek document, but its addressees are Greek-speaking Gentile Christians. By the time of the Gospel According to Matthew, there had been a relatively smooth and mild transition into a Gentile Christian milieu. The setting could be Syria, but hardly Antioch, where the Pauline mission had sharpened the theological issues far beyond what seems to be the case in Matthew. \nMatthew has no need to argue against the Law, or Torah, as divisive for the church (as had been the case earlier with Paul in Romans and Galatians, in which the Law was divisive among Gentile Christians and Jewish Christians), and, indeed, the Law is upheld in Matthew (5:17–19). For Matthew, there had already been a separation of Christianity from its Jewish matrix. When he speaks about the “scribes and the Pharisees,” he thinks of the synagogue “across the street” from the now primarily Gentile church. Christianity is presented as superior to Judaism even in regard to the Law and its ethical demands.\nThe Matthean church is conscious of its Jewish origins but also of a great difference in that it is permeated with an eschatological perspective, seeing itself not only as participating in the suffering of Christ (as in Mark) but also as functioning even in the face of persecution while patiently—but eagerly—awaiting the Parousia. \nThere is much more, but the above will suffice.

Its first few expositions at Lirey in the open air were sporadic events.  For perhaps a few decades during the 15th century there were annual expositions on the banks of the Doubs River, and it was also taken to Liege and to Macon to be exhibited there.  From 1453 to 1983 it was under the care of the House of Savoy, since when it has been in the care of the Turin custodians.  It was brought out for public veneration on particular occasions, and not left hanging freely on a wall in some cathedral, to be damaged by continual exposure to the light.  It is also known that during these seven centuries, the Shroud was cared for, maintained and repaired with some skill.  \nIf the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Christ, then its initial environment would have to be in the Middle East, Judea or Syria, a climate conducive to preservation.  Those who have studied the clues have it stored in an earthenware jar, or bricked up in a wall, or else stored safely in a deep well.  The written clues are few and only occasional, so it is evident that it was seldom exhibited or else used as a banner against invading armies, but kept as a secret to be known only to a select elite.  At some time it would have been taken to Constantinople to become part of the imperial relic collection.  This is not the story of an object subject to the damaging effects of exposure, moth or mildew, but an object that was carefully preserved.  \nWhat of other linen objects? \nAt an upper-Paleolithic excavation site at Dzudzuana Cave in the eastern-European country of Georgia, archaeologists discovered flax fibers that were preserved inside pollen chambers for 34,000 years. To date, they are the oldest evidence of man-made textiles ever discovered. The fibers at Dzudzuana showed evidence of having been knotted and dyed bright colors like turquoise and pink, consistent with the style of other artefacts left behind.\nFast forward a few thousand years of evolution and innovation and we find, at an ancient site in eastern Turkey, a piece of 9,000 year-old, simply-woven linen cloth clinging to a bone tool—presumably once wrapped around the handle for a better grip. Archaeologist and ancient textile expert Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood supposes this rudimentary fabric was produced on a crude loom of only four sticks, and woven in a manner derived from the already well-established practice of basket-weaving.\nWhen the mummy of the boy-pharaoh Tutankhamun was unearthed in 1922 CE, portions of the linen wrappings that covered his remains were almost perfectly preserved, the hieroglyphed dates still legible despite the millennia. \nThere are other examples, see: http://www.decktowel.com/pages/linen-history  \nThiebault’s review of artist’s copies of the Shroud as given above indicate that all of them endeavoured to replicate the faintness of the image that they saw.  The image of the Shroud was never a painting, and there is not a single piece of evidence that can support the notion.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2015 at 11:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Then you have some catching up to do.

Its origins are very ancient indeed, as most primal peoples believe in some kind of a spirit world, and “soul” would seem to be a derivative of this idea.  There is hardly a single philosopher or theologian who has not had his own unique ideas of the concept, few of them identical.  There is an excellent Wikipedia article on “soul” demonstrating these diverse ideas from very many civilisations, religions and philosophies.  \nExtracts from Encyclopedia Britannica:\n[Both the Chinese and ancient Egyptians seem to have favoured types of trichotomy:]  “The Egyptian ka (breath) survived death but remained near the body, while the spiritual ba proceeded to the region of the dead. The Chinese distinguished between a lower, sensitive soul, which disappears with death, and a rational principle, the hun, which survives the grave and is the object of ancestor worship.”\n“The early Hebrews apparently had a concept of the soul but did not separate it from the body, although later Jewish writers developed the idea of the soul further. Old Testament references to the soul are related to the concept of breath and establish no distinction between the ethereal soul and the corporeal body. Christian concepts of a body-soul dichotomy originated with the ancient Greeks and were introduced into Christian theology at an early date by St. Gregory of Nyssa and by St. Augustine.”\n“In Christian theology, St. Augustine spoke of the soul as a “rider” on the body, making clear the split between the material and the immaterial, with the soul representing the “true” person. However, although body and soul were separate, it was not possible to conceive of a soul without its body. In the European Middle Ages, St. Thomas Aquinas returned to the Greek philosophers’ concept of the soul as a motivating principle of the body, independent but requiring the substance of the body to make an individual.” [End of Encyc Brit extracts]\nJohn Klotz’s assertion that the idea that it is a concept “wrapped snugly in a Middle Age straight jacket” is a tempting one, but the concept is still very current and continues to be debated, if not so much by modern philosophers, then certainly by theologians.  However I tend to concur with his assertion that: “It is at the quantum level that we glimpse existence not fettered by normal [Newtonian?] considerations of space and time.”  It seems to be a hint that there are certainly other realms.  But the concept of Christ’s Resurrection only makes sense in terms of primordial consciousness, if He is identified with this primordial consciousness. \nI think that the concept of “parallel universes” is a useful mental stepping stone to our understanding of these other realms, and a “supernatural universe”.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2012 at 6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/11/yannick-clments-summa-theologica/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Yannick Clément’s Summa Theologica"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Christ’s body did not dematerialise at the Resurrection.

It utterly fails to acknowledge the role of religion in the development of science, commencing with the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas; pioneers in Renaissance science, including astronomers Copernicus and Galileo, Founders of the calculus Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz; and so many others who came after them, Kepler, Blaise Pascal and so on.  The break-through with Aquinas demonstrated that order was to be sought in the workings of the universe, and that phenomena were not the work of a capricious God or random Fate.  Even the battling Bernoulli family with all their internal strife were originally intended for the Church.  \nAt the heart of the Arab development commencing in the fifth century, was the motivation of Islamic objectives.  The atheism and agnosticism of some modern scientists with their so-called “rational” approach is a relatively modern phenomenon.  Commencing in the 12th c, the universities were founded on religious principles, and required religious affirmation.  \nThe assertion makes the assumption that professional scientists are unable to set aside their religious beliefs in a way that compromises their scientific endeavours.  It fails to understand the professionalism and integrity with which professional scientists approach their work.  \nShroud researches have advanced most significantly by those with a religious belief, or as a result of their research, came to such a belief.  What is being said is that only atheists can make a useful contribution to Shroud research.  This is even more ludicrous than asserting that only scientists with a religious belief should carry out such research!  To deify the work of Rogers, is to misdirect the object of true worship.  It also fails to allow that in fact, for all we may know, there may only be a supernatural explanation for the image. that only scientists can provide an explanation.

The English is excellent, making for easy reading, and if he sought assistance for this, it showed good judgement.  I agree with him up to the point that it cannot be definitively asserted that the image had a miraculous origin, as up to the present time there is insufficient evidence.  It is an error of judgement for a scientist, or even an engineer, to assert at this stage that it does have a miraculous origin, although one might have a private view about this.  However, where I think I may depart from Yannick’s expressed viewpoint, is that it MAY have a miraculous origin.  I suggest that one piece of evidence that could support this view, is the apparent lack of body deformation on the dorsal view – it appears to be suspended weightless in space – or to put it another way, it is as if the image was formed in the upright position.  It is of course possible that the body may have been placed on its side, which could also explain the lack of dorsal body deformation. \nIt is an obligatory requirement of Catholic belief that miracles can and do happen (Check out the Catholic catechism).  However there is no obligatory requirement for any belief that any specific event generally deemed miraculous, was in fact miraculous.  It is well-known that the Church requires aduequate proof of miracle(s) for the causes of canonisation of saints.  Most of these are otherwise inexplicable healings, but other miracles are also admitted (check catechism). \nYannick, and also others, in their various comments, often emphasise the importance of understanding the chemical processes involved in forming the TS image.  However I also think it important to be accepting of various possible explanations involving the discipline of Physics.  The science of Physics may be just as important as Chemistry, and possibly even more so.  I have often mentioned in other postings the work of Giovanna de Liso, who obtained intriguing high-definition 3D images under moderate earthquake activity.  \nEarthquakes may be viewed as some kind of supernatural activity in Quebec.  I can assure Yannick that we take them in our stride in NZ, and also doubtless they do in California and Japan, and also apparently in Italy.  Nor are they rare events in the Middle East.

The purpose is to determine the original form and the relationship of the life and thought of the period to the development of the literary tradition.”  Encyc Brit.  \n“Form criticism has become one of the most valuable tools for the reconstruction of the preliterary tradition. This discipline classifies the literary material according to the principal “forms”—such as legal, poetic, and other forms—represented in its contents, and examines these in order to discover how they were handed down and what their successive life settings were until they assumed their present shape and position. In their various ways laws, narratives, psalms, and prophecies are amenable to this approach. By this means some scholars have undertaken to recover the ipsissima verba (“very own words”) of Jesus by removing the accretions attached to them in the course of transmission.

A frequent like complaint against his article expressed by several on this web-site, including authenticity sceptic Colin, is that it is utterly unsupported by any scientific evidence, and in the opinion of many is actually contradicted by such scientific evidence as there is.  Touche! \nOf particular value in the ongoing debate in my view is the several fascinating related art works that have come to light as a result, which many of us were utterly unaware of.  The existence of these works is a significant phenomenon, but it is in the interpretation of their significance which remains elusive.  Which influenced what?  Charles’ advocates seem to be taking the position that the Shroud falls within the genre.  Contrariwise, his opponents might tend to take the position that it was the revelation of the authentic burial cloth of Christ that produced and influenced the genre and the consequential art works. \nOne significant criticism I think is that the article is highly speculative, relying as it does on the ‘flaky paint’ idea which remains utterly unsubstantiated, and cannot explain the particular properties of the image.  Whether the approach would satisfy the “historical critical” method mentioned by Andrea Nicoletti from time to time is a matter I am not qualified to comment, but I would say that it does not seem to be particularly evident here. \nCharles has mentioned that he has been in contact with various experts concerning his thesis and has claimed to have won some support.  I would guess that they are of a like mind to his own, no doubt art experts in their various field, and unsympathetic to any pro-authenticity argument.  I would wonder how well they understand what work has been achieved in the scientific investigations of the Shroud, how little they might actually know about it, and if any of them have anything resembling a scientific qualification of any kind. \nThe whole business underscores the necessity of a multi-disciplinary approach in evaluating the object.  Specialists locked in their own little world by themselves may be able to shed some light on singular aspects of the Shroud, but left to themselves will not give the answers that many of us crave and seek concerning this fascinating topic.  Whether it is a matter of textiles, artistic significance, historic documentation, the cloth’s origins, how the image may have been produced, its properties, corroborating evidence, forensics, botany, chemistry or physics, burial rites, significant contaminations, liturgical significance, there is plenty here that needs be considered.  Only a holistic approach to the problem is likely to produce a satisfying answer.  Each must consider how work by others in related and unrelated fields must be weighed against one’s own endeavours.

It is correct that the ‘suffering servant’ section seems to be from the end of the Babylonian exile, whereas the ministry of the original prophet Isaiah extended from 742 – 701 BC.  \nChapters 40–55 (Second Isaiah, or Deutero-Isaiah) are generally attributed to an anonymous poet who prophesied toward the end of the Babylonian exile. From this section come the great oracles known as the Servant Songs, which are reflected in the New Testament understanding of the passion and glorification of Christ.  Subsequent chapters 56-66 (Trito-Isaiah) are post-exilic.  \nI see it is as no coincidence that there is a very close correspondence between Isaiah’s suffering servant, which he likely identifies as Israel, and the sufferings of Christ.

There is said to be aragonite present on the nose, a knee and on the soles of the feet.  There is a persuasive argument that this is Jerusalem road dust from the TSM walking to the place of execution and from a fall during this journey.  \nAs to any other limestone present, it will depend on whether it is in the form of dust or has merely been shown to be optically present.  If in the form of dust it would be desirable to know if it is CaCO3 or aragonite, the two different minerals indicating separate sources.  If it has been only shown to be merely optically present, it is easily explained by absorption during the retting process of the flax in a limestone environment, which would include the environs of Jerusalem;  retting would also explain the presence of iron, quantification of trace minerals such as strontium potentially indicating a specific site.  \nThe pattern of the poker holes would suggest it may have then been folded to match the size of an altar table.  It has been argued that the holes may have been formed by grains of incense when the cloth may have been used as an altar cloth or even a corporal as Max suggests.  The ancient historical sources equating the altar cloths with the burial cloths is at least suggestive that it may have been used at some type of special liturgy for this purpose. \nIf the limestone is dust, it may have adhered to the cloth from the tomb or else from a limestone altar table.  \nCharles’ argument that gesso priming for painting the cloth is in my view a very weak one, as it is necessary to know the form of which the additional limestone occurs, CaCO3 or aragonite dust or merely optical lime.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2014 at 7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I believe that strict biblical exegesis can only take us so far, and that sometimes the insights of mystics are to be preferred.

The excesses of this movement was to relegate the scriptures to outright mythology, eventually leading to Pope Pius X condemning the error of “modernism”.  The theological conflict within the Church at this time was therefore between those who wished to modernise the Church for the twentieth century and those who wished to defend time-honoured religious traditions.  \nPia’s negative photographs of the Shroud appeared to support it as the authentic burial cloth of Christ and consequently the historical accuracy of the Passion as recorded in the gospels, and was therefore disconcerting to the progressive movement.   \nConsequently the progressive movement needed to discredit the Shroud in order to achieve their aims.

I would surmise he is well-enough versed in what constitutes fraud, and no less to write about particular cases, perhaps even more so than any historian.  \nThurston may have offered his own explanation for the origins of the Shroud, but it is Markwardt’s charge that it was Thurston and Chevalier who entered a conspiracy to deceive by impugning the Shroud’s reputation.  Part of his conclusion is as follows: \n“In order to defeat the conservative clergy, Chevalier and Thurston entered into a\ncivil conspiracy when, with knowledge of a plan by their progressive colleagues to cause\nserious injury to the reputation of the Shroud of Turin, they employed improper means\ndesigned to accomplish that end. Confronted by the truly confounding nature of the\nscientific evidence presented by Pia’s photographic negatives, they were forced to base\ntheir entire case against the authenticity of the Shroud upon the D’Arcis Memorandum.\nBy publishing a fictional transcription of that document and manufacturing a convenient\ndate for same, Chevalier effectively created the false illusion that the memorandum’s\ncharges of forgery were credible because they had been submitted to, and reviewed by,\nthe Pope in Avignon. By purposefully truncating his translation of that document, so as to\nexclude evidence that would have shown it to be a mere draft and would have\ncontradicted Chevalier’s arbitrary dating, Thurston effectively confirmed this false\nillusion.”  \nThere is more which can be read in Markwardt’s paper.  \n“Several years after publishing his abbreviated translation of the D’Arcis Memorandum, Thurston authored several articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia that labeled the Shroud a scandalous product of unscrupulous medieval miscreants and he steadfastly maintained this position for the rest of his life.” \nThe 1907 Catholic Encyclopedia article that Thurston wrote remains on line on the New Advent site today but is now merely of archival interest.  Despite the Pia negatives being available to him, Thurston’s article maintained that the image was painted, and made observations on the blood-stains that are patently false, as determined by the 1978 STURP project.  To rely on the D’Arcis memorandum, or to cite it as some kind of authority, in the face of the challenge which Markwardt has raised against it, specifically as based on the Chevalier-Thurston representation of it, is I consider irresponsible in an historian.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2014 at 5:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The fellow claims to be of average proportions, but I think he must be deformed nevertheless.

Although they have a historical basis, they are not intended to be history in the style of Heredotus or Josephus, but rather as proclamations.  The second half of Luke’s Acts deals with his journeys with Paul, yet they often seem not consistent with some of Paul’s theology expressed in the epistles. \nA particular perspective:  Matthew is concerned to portray Jesus as the new Moses, and his gospel is directed at a gentile community.  So he arranges to bring the infant Jesus out of Egypt, based on what may be a fictional massacre by Herod.

I haven’t included the informative annotations but you can easily check them out yourself, if you wish to learn more.  \nThe meaning is plain enough.  Mark’s is the basic original narrative, and the other evangelists have built on it either adding material known to them, or else omitting material by way of refinement.  The basic events are that Joseph took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and placed him in the tomb.  What part of this don’t you understand? Individual additions are:  ‘laid in a tomb hewn out of the rock’; ‘rolled a stone against the entrance’; ‘no-one had yet been buried there’;  ‘it was Joseph’s tomb and he had hewn it’; ‘Nicodemus brought myrrh and aloes’;  ‘bound the body with burial cloths along with the spices according to the Jewish burial custom’; ‘there was a garden and the tomb was close by’.  All perfectly consistent!   \nMark 15:45-46   44  Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died. 45  And when he learned of it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 46  Having bought a linen cloth, he took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock.

Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed.\nLuke 23:52-54  52  He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 53  After he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried. 54  It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin. \nJohn 38:38-42  38  After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus.

It tended to develop with the rise of the individual agricultural revolutions following the hunting and foraging periods of the several civilisations.  Probably one of the earliest alphabetic script of about 1400 BCE concerns an epic of the Phoenician god Baal-Hadad, a young virile god who dies in the autumn but is resurrected in the spring.  The cult had an attraction for the early agricultural Israelites, and was often condemned by the prophets, notably Ezekiel.  A feature of such fertility cults sometimes involved human sacrifice in order to fertilise the soil.  Following the return of the exiles, many of those who had married non-Jewish spouses were forbidden to return to Jerusalem and there was a strong Jewish settlement in Alexandria, eventually giving rise to the Greek Septuagint.  I have sometimes wondered whether their exposure to Egyptian funerary practices, together with the philosophy of Alexandrian Greek Platonism may have influenced the maturing development of resurrection theology from about 200 BCE.

It is typical of civilisations subject to random flooding bringing disaster that they will produce flood stories, and they even extend to India and other widely scattered locations.  In ancient Egypt, there were no such flood stories, presumably because the annual flooding of the Nile was predictable, and seen as benign and essential for maintaining soil fertility.  \nThe most notable story, was included as the eleventh tablet in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which dates from the third millenium, and was introduced subsequently, and is known from the library of Assurbanipal.  Following the death of his companion Enkidu. Gilgamesh goes on a quest to search for the secret of immortality. The secret is held by Utnapishtim, who dwells at the mouth of the rivers, and had been saved from the disastrous flood wrought by the gods.  In this story, the flood is seen as a deliberate spontaneous but erratic act to destroy humanity.  Utnapishtim as a protege of Ea is saved by means of an ark he builds, as in the Noah story.   In some other versions, he goes under the name Ziusudra or Atrahasis which date from the second millenium.  \nThe writers of the Noah story evidently became acquainted with such stories during the Babylonian exile, so that it is a fairly late inclusion in Genesis.  However the Judaic authors have their own agenda and interpretation, seeing the Lord their God as just and merciful, that man is perverse, and that God saves his faithful ones, and so design the moral of the story to suit their own purpose.  Although the Utnapishtim story remains as the best known, the Noah story is best seen against a general background of such flood stories, rather than any particular one. \nThe original concept of an ark, may have been suggested by a peculiar rock formation such as that apparently in the neighbourhood of Mt Ararat, and is an aetiological component of the story, designed to explain its origin, and also to provide the saving transport in the story.  The ark is a potent symbol both in Judaism and in later Christianity.  A peculiar salt pillar formation is probably behind the story of Lot’s wife.  Such aetiology is a common feature of ancient and primal myths.  \nSource “Epic of Gilgamesh”, N K Sanders, Penguin, my copy 1982\n\n","date":"July 23, 2015 at 5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/23/because-if-it-looks-unbelievable/","cat":"article","title":"Because If It Looks Unbelievable"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The ark is of course more than just transport.

In New Testament Christianity, the Church will be seen as a type of the ark, outside of which there is no salvation.  On the Sea of Galilee, the lives of the apostles are threatened by the storm, and by drowning, but Jesus comes towards them across the stormy waters, or in another version of a similar story he is with them in the boat but is asleep, and they wake him to calm the storm.

Maybe he’s a post-modernist who doesn’t believe in facts anyway, so what’s his opinion worth?  He’s obviously ignorant of Ian Wilson’s credible reconstruction of the the Shroud’s history, supported by extensive documentation. \nFact 1: 544 AD, Persian prince Khosraw with formidable army is repulsed from Edessa’s walls; Attributed to protective powers of the Jesus-imprinted cloth, confidently referred to as being brought to Edessa during reign of Abgar V, five centuries earlier.  Cloth had been recenty found sealed above the city gates, where it had been hidden when Abgar’s successors reverted to paganism.  Contemporary accounts refer to it as “not by hand made”, some call it a “sindon”, and also as “tetradiplon”, doubled in four, that it was therefore a much larger cloth folded considerably smaller than its full size. \nFact 2:  Previous depictions of Jesus in art, had shown him as beardless.  From this time on (544) the distinctive depictions of Jesus as long-haired and bearded, with many of the incidental features of the “Shroud” face (Vignon markings).emerge and are extensively copied and distributed throughout Eastern Christendom.  Yet, prior to 430 AD, St Augustine of Hippo had previously mentioned a general ignorance in his time about the physical appearance of Jesus.  Coinage is issued showing the Jesus likeness.\nFact 3:  943 AD: Byzantine general with large army at Edessa’s walls, negotiates for surrender of Jesus-imprinted cloth, in return for sparing the city and the release of Muslim prisoners. Cloth is taken to Constantinople.  Under Byzantine religious culture, public showings are extremely rare. \nFact 4: 1130 AD: High-ranking western visitors to Constaninople are occasionally shown treasures of the relic collection.  Normandy-based monk Orderic Vitalis and others report that the Edessa cloth, besides Jesus’ facial imprint, displays ‘the form and size of the Lord’s body to all who look upon it’.  \nFact 5:  ~1192:  Hungary’s ‘Pray manuscript’ shows body of Jesus laid out totally naked in identical ‘crossed hands’ style to Shroud.  The drawings depict the mysterious triple poker holes (ordeal by fire about 679 AD?), as well as indications of the 3-in-1 herring-bone weave of the Shroud textile,  \nFact 6:  1204:  French-led Fourth Crusade sacks Contantinople with pillaging of several relics.  Edessa Mandylion disappears.  In 1205, letter to Pope Innocent III complains of loss of “the linen in which Our Lord Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death”.  Wilson makes a strong case for it being kept in secret by the Knights Templar until their suppression by Philip the Fair 1307-1314.  \nFact 7:  1344: French knight Geoffry I de Charny, first-known Western owner of the Shroud fights Turks in Smyrna.  In 1349, back in France, he seeks and obtains permission from Pope Clement VI to build a church in his home village of Lirey, where the Shroud is later exhibited.  Connections can be made between Geoffrey I and an earlier namesake of the Knights Templar burnt at the stake with Jaques de Molay, both high dignitaries of the order.  Geoffrey de Charney is killed at the Battle of Poitiers 1356, before he is ready to divulge his ownership of the Shroud. \nFact 8:  1356; Bishop Henry of Troyes praises Geoffry I de Charny for his founding of the Lirey church.  In 1389, his successor Bishop D’Arcis of Troyes instigates royal officials to seize the Shroud from Geoffrey II de Charny but are folied.  Bishop D’Arcis writes forceful letter to Pope Clement VII, claiming that Bishop Henry had looked into the matter and that it had been cunningly painted.  Pope Clement VII declines his request that showings be stopped and orders Bishop D’Arcis to perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication.  Letter from Bishop D’Arcis is devoid of any documentary or factual evidence or proof, even though any documentation would have been available to him.  His charge seems to be based on hearsay.  \nConclusion:  To say that the Shroud emerged out of nowhere in 1353 is a gross exaggeration.  A credible history can be reconstructed.  We do not have the testimony of two bishops, but only one bishop who alleges that his predecessor found that it had been “cunningly painted”, apparently based on hearsay.

Certainly Prof Fanti has no known medical forensic pathology qualifications enabling him to make such a judgement. The caution is based on Pierre Barbet’s insistence that a dislocation will result in a shortening of the arm, not a lengthening.  Barbet has the arms stretched out at right angles to the body for nailing to the patibulum lying on the ground.  On elevation, the body sag results in the arms taking a position at 65deg to the vertical.  He writes: “… there has been a good deal of talk about the arms being lengthened by dislocation, and I have had some difficulty in convincing good friends of the shroud who are not, however, versed in anatomy; this is a matter that need some understanding. Dislocation could only take place in the joints of the shoulder and the elbow. A dislocation of one or the other would shorten the arm and would not lengthen it.” A shortening is not what is seen on the Shroud image.  The result of suspension from the wrists can result in an elongation of four or five centimetres at the most, and this conforms to the geometry of the arm taking up the position from horizontal to 65deg as the hypoteneuse of the triangulation.  “Doctor at Calvary” Pierre Barbet, 1963; ‘The Wounds of the Hands, p.107. Barbet had his original French work published in 1950; It would seem that the Padua and Palermo medical authorities have yet to be aware of it. Unless of course they can claim that Barbet was mistaken, or unless they have experimental evidence to be able to claim the contrary.

I may for instance find reasons why the apostles were mistaken, that the evangelists in proclaiming the message of Jesus iced the cake by introducing a mythic element of bodily resurrection, or that their message really meant something else and that the myth has been perpetuated in the church, and that we have failed to understand what was really meant.  \nHowever I am impressed by the social teaching of Jesus, his message of brotherly love, his sense of liberation from the fetters of the past, his sense of justice, of what constitutes true religion in the works of mercy, of doing good to others, even one’s enemy.  I may see this as a message that needs whatever it takes to survive, and to be embraced by all mankind.  \nI might then see the resurrection of Christ as present in spirit in the body of the church, or present in a sense of fellowship, or present in the persons of the suffering.  I reach out to this Christ as if he himself were truly present in these ways. \nIs this not a better way than that of the atheist who rejects any sense of the divine or any sense of mystery?  Is it fair to cast the stones of judgment against those who have honestly come to such a decision, for there are many of them?  Perhaps they follow more closely to the teachings of Jesus than those who prefer to rely on tired old doctrinal formulae. \nThat is the challenge and decision point for the Christian to make.  I think it is fairly close to the interpretation of Hans Kung who was prohibited from teaching in Catholic seminaries and universities on this account.\n\n","date":"July 6, 2015 at 2:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/04/christian-faith-eroded-to-the-very-core/","cat":"article","title":"Christian Faith Eroded to the Very Core?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It is worth going to the link to read not only the full text of Badde’s article, but to read some of the comments and Badde’s responses to them.  I would concur with Louis that there are too many doubts about the Manopello image, but Badde has his two witnesses with the Oviedo relic, and of course there are many more independent witnesses in the New Testament and even a few in the contemporary secular literature.  \nJ P Meier’s response to criticisms of the alleged unreliability of the NT seems to have been to have adopted a minimalist approach in his attempts to deal with the historical questions. \nBultmann’s legacy still survives, even though he is now considered passe.  He was correct in asserting that Jesus survived in the kerygma, in the proclamation of the apostles, but wrong in asserting that his bones were somewhere in Palestine.  That apostolic proclamation was that Jesus did indeed survive death and was resurrected in body and spirit, not merely in his teaching.  \nThe legacy of Bultmann is pervasive.  Within the last year or so a posting here confirmed that many clergymen (even a majority) in England rejected the bodily resurrection as a literal truth.  It also seemed to influence Hans Kung.  The Jesus Seminar remains an influential movement. \nIn 1967 here in NZ, a Presbyterian theologian, Lloyd Geering, gained a high profile when he was arraigned before the General Assembly for denying the resurrection and disturbing the peace and unity of the Presbyterian church.  The charges were brought by a conservative group of laymen and a conservative minister, but were dismissed without being much discussed.  Geering became a highly influential spokesman in the NZ religious scene.  Googling on his name will reveal a highly prolific literary output on religious themes, all of course denying the resurrection, and denying the notion that God is a real supernatural being who created and continues to look over the world.  \nAged now 97, he has until recently continued to have a high outspoken and controversial profile.  He was honoured in 1988 as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and in 2001 as Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. In the 2007 New Year Honours List he was made a Member of the Order of New Zealand. In 2009, his status as a Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit was re-designated to that of Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. \nMy own personal belief is that God wills that all shall be saved (c.f. Lumen Gentium).  However rejecting God in the certain knowledge of his existence would be a sin for which there could be no forgiveness.  Consequently He wills that belief shall remain a matter of faith only.

You’ll recall that James’ Epistle had something to say about this matter, to the effect that his good works demonstrate his faith. \nRegarding Geering.  I’m reasonably familiar with much of what he has to say on a wide variety of topics, having heard several of his broadcasts, attended some of his lectures, in personal conversation with him, and read some of his work.  I don’t really need any more.  Google on “Lloyd Geering Lectures” and you’ll see there that anyone would be impressed with the prodigious output of the man on a wide variety of topics. \nFor a succinct but comprehensive summary I recommend a NZ Listener interview of 15 August 2013, when at the age of 95 he had published his most recent work, “From the Big Bang to God”.  You might note there that he was greatly impressed with Teilhard’s “Phenomenon of Man” which he read in the 1960s.

The Queen’s assent as exercised by a G-G is required before a bill passed by Parliament can pass into the statute books.  If a government can obtain supply, then this is usually no more than a matter of routine, and it would be exceeding rare for a G-G to withhold the Queen’s assent, even if he had personal or conscience objections to the bill.  \nThe most notable case of a G-G acting against the wishes of Parliament was in 1975 when Governor-General Kerr dismissed Australian Labour Prime MInister Gough Whitlam, as Whitlam was unable to get his legislation past the Opposition dominated Senate.  Kerr dissolved Parliament by proclamation, declared Opposition leader Malcolm Fraser as interim Prime Minister on condition that supply would be granted, and then called for a general election which Fraser won by a land-slide.  \nThe situation would hardly arise in New Zealand which has a single House of Representatives, and Parliament only requires a simple majority to guarantee supply.  \nSir Anand Satyanand attended Sacred Heart secondary boy’s college in Auckland, an acquaintance mentioned that he was prominent in the schools G&S annual productions, and he was well-known as a prominent Catholic layman.  \nIn NZ, candidates for the Queen’s honours may be recommended by various informed lobby groups, these go forward to the Prime Minister’s office, and the G-G would bestow the honour as advised by the Prime Minister.

However both Matthew and Luke also introduce new material, which they know about independently of Mark and of each other.  John also seems to take Mark as the core story, but introduces a lot more.  So far that’s four very nearly independent witnesses.  However John goes further, and stymies any apparition fable that may have developed by introducing the story of Thomas, the reluctant believer, and Thomas is told to touch the wounds in the hands and the sides.  You can’t touch an apparition, nor a ghost!  \nIn the Acts of the Apostles, Luke has some disciples on the way to Emmaus and they encounter the Lord, at first unrecognised.

The first missionaries here were English Anglican led by Samuel Marsden in the early 1800s.  Irish goldminers, and ex-convicts from Australia gave a Catholic presence, and Bishop Pompallier with his French Marists arrived here in 1837.  The colony’s founding document was the Treaty of Waitangi signed by most of the Maori chiefs from about 1840, after which there was extensive British immigration.  Many of the settlers had been familiar with the religious dissensions and strife in their home countries.  Some were glad to leave them behind, others brought their dissension with them.  In 1870 the NZ Parliament passed the Education Act which made education free, compulsory and secular.  The secular clause had a profound effect on the NZ religious outlook.  Heavy NZ involvement in two World Wars on the other side of the globe, and subsequently in the Pacific also had their effect in forming the NZ psyche.   \nWe are led to believe that NZ is fundamentally now a secular society, but there is still a strong Christian presence, and for the most part there are good relations between the several denominations.  There are about eight universities in New Zealand from Auckland in the north to Dunedin in the south, a few of which have Religious Studies departments.  Geering was a significant forming influence in the founding of these departments.  The Presbyterian Church in NZ has had a reputation for heresy trials, and consequently Geering was arraigned before the General Assembly as a result of promulgating his beliefs.  \nAs I mentioned above, he has had a prodigious literary output, and in his time was the darling of religious broadcasters, and a favourite of lecture circuits.  Several of the Protestant churches combined to form a Union Church, and Geering has been active in this realm.  Apart from the churches, there is now a strong secular outlook in NZ society, resulting in a national spiritual void, which the likes of Geering have been able to exploit. \nOther NZers may have a different perspective from my rather terse analysis.\n\n","date":"July 5, 2015 at 3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/04/christian-faith-eroded-to-the-very-core/","cat":"article","title":"Christian Faith Eroded to the Very Core?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"It only requires a single fibre to determine if the Manoppello is made from true byssus or not, the test is very simple, and if a fibre has been taken as reported, then whoever examined it ought to have known immediately.

It suffices more or less to refer to the text in the comment above provided by Colin on May 4 at 2:00 am.  \nFirstly, D’Arcis himself had not spoken with the alleged artist.  He is reporting what he believes the investigations of Bishop Henri found some 34 years previously, and he was writing in Latin.  He is claiming that Bishop Henri inquired into the matter, and who did Henri consult?    D’Arcis says that Henri was urged by many “responsible people” to investigate it, and that Henri consulted “many theologians and (others)” who declared it could not be the true Shroud of Christ.  Why?  Because the gospels did not mention it, and if it had occurred then the evangelists would have done so!  That is a fairly specious kind of reasoning,  In the situation of the early Church there were excellent grounds for not mentioning certain matters that needed to be kept secret (disciplina arcana).  Note that no names of specific theologians who Henri is said to have consulted are mentioned. \nD’Arcis then continues:\n“In the end, after a thorough investigation and interrogation, and that the fact would not remained hidden until today, he discovered the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by (the?) artist who painted(?) it, namely that it was the talented work of said man, and not miraculously wrought or bestowed by divine grace “\nNote that this artist remains unnamed, unknown, and Latin having no definite article, it could have been anyone who painted any cloth like the Shroud some 35 years previously.  Does Bishop D’Arcis provide any corroboration for his allegation?  Not a citation, no reference from his episcopal archives, no quotation from what Bishop Henri had written, all indirect reporting.  Furthermore no document has ever been found or identified written by Bishop Henri that would corroborate anything that D’Arcis claims about Henri’s investigations. \nContrariwise, it is known that Bishop Henri was effusive in his praise for the De Charney’s efforts in founding the Lirey Church with its canons, and had nothing to say against their character, which would hardly be the case if there were any suspicion of fraud.  D’Arcis’ claims appear to be reduced to hearsay, and what he believed to be the case from what he had heard.  He may well be a hostile witness, as his cathedral is losing pilgrims to a tiny village church, and is badly in need of cash for major repairs.  \nWhat we know of D’Arcis’ writing is mainly due to Chevalier and Thurston, writing about 1905 and who had their own agenda, in following the developing Germanic theology, which sought to mythologise the Passion and Resurrection narratives in the scriptures, whereas Pia’s photography and Delage’s forensics had given them a more literal likelihood and challenged this direction.  This situation in the Church at the time prompted Pope Pius X to write his well-known encyclical against Modernism, “Pascendi Dominici gregis” on Sep 8, 1907.  A reading of this encyclical will demonstrate the directions that many churchmen of the time sought to achieve.  \nSkeptics who cite the D’Arcis memorandum as evidence against the authenticity of the Shroud are on swampy ground!

Now you are trying to call into doubt the content.”  No, both!  \nMarkwardt I think makes an excellent case, substantiated by citations.  Some of his conclusions: \n“The progressive clerical conspiracy against the Shroud successfully suppressed the simple truth that Pierre D’Arcis, sentenced to perpetual silence and fearing that a papal investigation would prove his charges baseless, thought better of having his draft memorandum transcribed and then prudently discarded it. … The conspiracy’s enduring influence is attributable both to the estimable standing and reputation of its participants and also to the false premise that they had conducted thorough research, amassed numerous authentic and corroborating documents, and based their conclusions upon hard documentary evidence.” \n“In 1903, Herbert Thurston confidently pronounced the Shroud a fraud and sanctimoniously proclaimed that “…the probability of an error in the verdict of history must be accounted…as infinitesimal”. A review of the complete record, however, persuasively establishes the ultimate irony that an inauthentic document and an inauthentic translation were used to undermine the case for the Shroud’s authenticity and that Chevalier and Thurston’s “verdict of history” was procured with manufactured evidence, withheld material facts, and false testimony.”  \nMy comments above addressed what substance there might be in the draft, and found it seriously deficient.  D’Arcis would have had complete and free access to all and any evidence in Bishop Henri’s archives, but provides not a single document, not a single fact, not a single phrase from Bishop Henri against the expositions.  It is all hearsay.  It is even suggestive of malicious motives, because of his own problems.  The best that can be said is that perhaps he honestly believed that survival of the burial cloths were too improbable and saw it as his duty to protest against what he saw as an abuse of a relic cult.  And so he made the best case he could, but his apparent inability to cite anything from Bishop Henri’s archives indicates that he had no real evidence.  The Papal Legate remained unimpressed, likewise Pope Clement VII. \nThe cordial relations between Bishop Henri and the De Charnay family are relevant, as it is unthinkable that Henri would be so effusive in his praise if he had any real objections to the expositions which would have occurred at an earlier date.  His status as bishop would have been a weighty consideration in allowing the marriage of his niece to Geoffrey II some years later.  \nYou appear to have swallowed the Charles Freeman flaky paint origins of the Shroud.

His epaulettes were decorated with the motto “Honour conquers all!”  Hardly the character of a person given to any kind of fraud!  \nHe is so highly thought of, that he is appointed to the coveted role of porte-oriflamme, and is killed defending his king at the Battle of Poitiers 1356, 19 Sept.  He leaves a widow and a young son Geoffrey II, who is still a boy.  It is likely that the Shroud was displayed in Lirey during his life-time, probably in 1355, as the medallion struck for the event shows his arms on the dexter side while those of his wife are displayed on the sinister.  The year would match the date implied by the D’Arcis memorandum.  \nBishop Henri of Poitiers was appointed to the See of Troyes in 1350, having previously been Bishop of Gap.  He survived until 1370, some 14 years after the death of Geoffrey I.  He was succeeded by two short-term bishops before Pierre D’Arcis.  It seems that Troyes remained relatively untouched by the wars, and there would seem to be little that would have imperilled the diocesan archives during this time.  \nIn 1356, 28 May, only a few months before the disastrous Battle of Poitiers, Bishop Henri goes on record as praising Geoffrey I for his founding of the Lirey Church.  There seems no suggestion that the Lirey expositions are a reason for any caution in this regard, and they do not seem to be mentioned.  At some subsequent date, Geoffrey II marries Margaret de Poitiers, niece of Bishop Henri through his brother Charles de Poitiers.  They have two daughters, Margaret de Charny and Henriette.  \nClearly the relationship between Bishop Henri and the de Charnay family were rather more cordial than the Bishop D’Arcis’ letter would allow.  There is no reference to Henri’s investigations, nor his consulting with unnamed theologians, nor of some chat with an unknown artist, nor is any such evidence cited by D’Arcis.  \nBishop D’Arcis received little sympathy from the Papal Legate on the substance of his complaint, and was twice enjoined by Pope Clement VII to perpetual silence on the matter under pain of excommunication.  If there was any evidence he could quote to bolster his case, it was readily available to him in the diocesan archives, but the best he can do is only to give a vague time lapse of 34 years as to its timing.  There is no quotation or citing of any text from Bishop Henri’s alleged investigations.   \nThe document is redolent of hearsay, misguided zealotry, and not a little self-interest.   During the Christmas of 1389, a disaster overtook D’Arcis’ Troyes cathedral which had been under construction for the past century.  The entire nave collapsed because of the failure of one of the arches, and the rose window of the north transept fell out.  Decades of fund-raising had gone to waste and he had a cathedral filled with rubble and broken glass.  He had to hire 30 labourors merely to clear the mess.  \nIn the meantime, thousands of pilgrims who might have provided the funds for his much-needed remedial work, were flocking to a tiny village church within his diocese, but over which he had no control because of its collegial status.  How galling it must have been for him.  \nOf the paint that he claims was so cunningly applied by his unknown artist, there remains not a vestige.  If Bishop Henri ever discovered the secret of the image as alleged, then he imparted it to no-one, nor was it known to his successor Bishop D’Arcis, nor has anyone else since ever discovered this marvelous secret.\n\n","date":"May 7, 2015 at 6:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I consider this whole point-scoring fiddling argument concerning Latin verbiology is irrelevant, unimportant, unnecessary, and a most unfortunate distraction from the more fundamental issue that there is nothing of substance in the D’Arcis memorandum, relied on so heavily by skeptics to discredit the Shroud.

Does daveb think it is all lies? Does he think that Henry of Poitiers did not suppress the exhibition of the Shroud? Does he think that Bishop Henry, or Bishop d’Arcis, was lying?”  \nChevalier created the impression that the memorandum was in fact dispatched to Clement VII.  My recollection of Markwardt’s paper is that he asserts that it was a final draft sent to a specialist scrivener expert in preparing formal documents addressed to the papacy, but there is no evidence that it went any further than this.  Markwardt’s reasons for stating this are Chevalier’s deliberate omissions, subsequently compounded by Thurston.  Hence it is an ‘alleged memorandum’.   \nThere is no evidence that D’Arcis’ predecessor, Bishop Henry objected to the expositions except the claim made by D’Arcis, who was unable to cite any document by Henry or provide any reference in his draft, nor even a definite date when it was supposed to have been sent, nor is there any present extant archived document by Henry to the purpose.  \nContrariwise, Bishop Henry is known to have been effusive in his praise for Geoffrey de Charney’s efforts and character.  \nThere are several possible reasons why D’Arcis objected to the expositions and prepared his draft.  D’Arcis was financially strapped for much needed maintenance and repairs to his own cathedral, whereas pilgrims who might have been expected to support it, were flocking to the small village church at Lirey for the expositions, so he made the best case he could in raising his objections.  He may have truly believed that the Shroud was a forgery, or else he may have been mistaken in what was in fact painted.  The Latin verb “depingere” can also have the meaning of “copy”, whereas “pingere” is more usual in describing something painted.   One explanation is that Jeanne de Vergy may have commissioned such a painting to replace the cloth taken from Besancon, and this is the actual cloth mistakenly referred to by D’Arcis some 35 years later.  \nIn view of any local ecclesial objections to the expositions, it is not surprising that they went into abeyance.  However the English defeats of the French, resulted in De Charnay’s widow and family being somewhat pauperised and deprived of much needed finance.  Hence the subsequent decisions of Geoffrey II and Margaret de Charney to renew the expositions, resulting in the D’Arcis’ objections.  An additional factor for caution in asserting authenticity, was the possibility of the Shroud being one of the many pillaged relics from Constantinople, with the implied threat of possible excommunication of those still involved.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2015 at 3:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“Domum pinxit” = “He painted the house” = maintenance work. \n“Domum depinxit” = “He painted a picture of his house” = “a landscape depiction”.\n\n","date":"May 4, 2015 at 5:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/30/colin-berry-yes-its-vitally-important-to-match-every-tiny-detail/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry: Yes, it’s vitally important to match every tiny detail"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Much as I would like to refresh my at one-time excellent school-boy Latin, I don’t really have the time to search the entire classical corpus to find a specific use of a particular word which might or might not satisfy the challenger. \nHowever “depingere” would seem to be derived from the verb “pingere” = ‘to paint’ and the preposition “de” used as a prefix meaning ‘from’; thus strictly, “depingere” would mean ‘to paint from’ that is, ‘to copy’.  \nSome on-line dictionary meanings: \nhttp://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/depingere\n“depingere:  See also: delineate, depict, describe, portray\nBurton’s Legal Thesaurus, 4E.

It was a blow taught in the military academies.  The exact wound is depicted in the “Dying Gaul” statue in Rome.  \nCertainly, Barbet approaches his subject as a committed Christian and Catholic, but his analysis throughout his work is thoroughly professional, and indeed at times he is critical of the pious interpretations of other writers, who adduce certain mystical or miraculous aspects to what are purely physiological occurrences.     \nThere is both pre-mortem and post-mortem blood flows on the Shroud and the Sudarium.  Particularly in the case of the Sudarium, there is more pre-mortem blood, as it seems to have been a type of hood placed over the head towards the end of the crucifixion to hide the grimace of the death rictus from passers-by.    \nIn the case of the three persons taken down from their crosses at the request of Josephus, only one survived, and yet none of them had been given the death blow, the “percussio”. \nIn the case of the blood flow across the back, Barbet makes a case for it having occurred during transport from the cross to the tomb.  Barbet is of the opinion that rigor mortis is manifest on the Shroud image.  \nAll four gospel accounts were written during the first century of the common era, but drew on pre-existing oral traditions and reports.  The Passion and Crucifixion narratives draw mainly on Mark as their basis, set down about 65 AD, but also use their own independent traditions and witnesses, corroborating one another.  They are unanimous that death had occurred.  The Quranic version on this interpretation was set down some hundreds of years later, cannot be said to have the benefit of eye-witness, and to this Christian, seems to have been written from a perspective to suit a doctrinal position only.  \nWhile Josephus is able to cite one single case of a survivor of crucifixion, I believe that no good case can be made that Jesus of Nazareth survived this terrible cruel punishment.  \nCordially, Daveb.\n\n","date":"June 7, 2015 at 4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/28/did-jesus-survive-the-crucifixion/","cat":"article","title":"Did Jesus Survive the Crucifixion?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Nope!

Consistent with other such discoveries, only 15 had inscriptions, of which 6 were female clan members.  Of the 9 male ossuaries, at least one of the names Yeshua or Youssef appeared, and on five of them both names appeared.  Two of these ossuaries were of brothers with pet names Yeshu and Youssi.  In one case the bones were identified as Yousefus cousin to Yeshuus.  Of the two remaining ossuaries one was identified as Youssef bar Yeshua, and the other Yeshua bar Youssef.\nProfessor Oulis discounted the likelihood that the ‘Yeshua bar Youssef’ box could be that of Jesus of Nazareth.  “The names were very common in 1st century Jerusalem”, he explained, “although admittedly this is a very unusual case.”  However,” he continued “We will need to review our statistical approach.”  \nHe referred to previous published papers where the expected occurrence of this particular inscription was said to be 1 in 10.  “Clearly,” he said “Even under the most favourable conditions, as at this tomb complex, the rate cannot be more than 1 in 45, and even this is exceptional.” \nIt has not been possible to verify Professor Oulis’ claims, as early after the arrival of the archaeologists, an influx of Haredim, opposed to such excavations, assailed the party, pelting them with stones.  The tomb complex has accordingly been shut down, and the architects are now working on a new design for the proposed hotel which will bypass the tomb site.\n\n","date":"April 12, 2015 at 4:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If every 1 in 10 ossuaries that had an inscription “Jesus son of Joseph” or its opposite was authentic, then every third male in 1st century Palestine would have had to have one of those names, and you can believe that to be the case if you wish, but I don’t happen to think that.

However there are two caveats 1) the soil is very common, and the ossuary might well have come from another tomb with similar soil;  associating it with Talpiot relies on various marker trace elements, and it has yet to be ascertained if other tombs in the area have similar or different quantities of these traces.  2) Golan the dealer expresses doubts, claiming that the ossuary came into his possession in 1976, whereas Talpiot was only excavated in 1980.  However Golan seems to be a fairly shady type of character, and his 1976 claim may only be a ruse so that he can retain possession of a pre-1978 ossuary as the IAA lays claim to any discovered after 1978.   Much has been made of the missing 10th ossuary which some have claimed was merely a plain box, but which others have believed to be the James ossuary.  If Golan is correct it just may have been acquired as a result of an earlier break-in, but in that case it would still seem to leave open the question of the tenth missing ossuary. \nNaturally “Jesus’ bones” feature in the report, that’s the sensationalist bait only.  I clearly recall when I became interested in this subject that James Cameron was insistent that the Jesus ossuary only ever contained a small carpal bone and some shreds of cloth, presumably a shroud.  So if Cameron is correct, the bones of Jesus is no issue at all.  At the time he had expressed hopes of getting some kind of match with the Turin Shroud, but of course nothing ever came of it.  One might speculate I suppose, that it may possibly have been an early repository for the Shroud, but excluding the bones.  Cameron’s more cautious approach was I believe in complete utter contrast to that of Jacobovici, who was clearly after making something more sensationalist out of the whole circus, with a purported marriage to Mary Magdalen, a son to them both, and the Jesus’ bones aspect.  \nWhen the controversy first broke, opponents were quick to point out that the names on the ossuaries were very common in 1st century Palestine, and the tomb could have belonged to anyone.  However it seemed to me then that these tended to ignore the probability of the particular combination of the full list of names,  Perhaps there may have been some ten families in Jerusalem with a similar combination of names.    \nI really need no reminder from Louis as to his position and his detailed research on the Talpiot affair, as I’m well aware of his position on this matter.  My own position verges on benign indifference.  I merely find the combination of names inscribed on the ossuaries a curious coincidence, that may have a quite reasonable explanation not yet understood.  But quite likely as Louis claims, it has nothing to do with the Jesus family at all.  I’m not sympathetic to any claim that Jesus was buried at Talpiot, but that might not exclude the possibility that some of his relations might have been.  We still have little idea where the Shroud might have been kept, it had to be kept somewhere, and it might not have been retained in Joseph’s tomb.  Perhaps Pilate’s wife had it all along.\n\n","date":"April 5, 2015 at 6:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"This posting began with two news items, one concerning a NY Times report concerning a geologist’s work who claimed to have identified the soil on the James ossuary as being consistent with the contentious Talpiot tomb.  Anyone at all is free to comment on this blog site about items that appear here.  My original comment is at April 5, 6:39 am, and having reread it, I see nothing to retract in it, but consider it to be a fair statement of the position. \nIt does so happen that I have particular training in statistics and applied probability, more so I would say than most other professional scientists, including even archaeologists, and a training which I often used and applied in my own professional career.  \nLouis clearly stated: “Just one fact: one in every ten ossuaries in Israel is said to have the inscription, “Jesus, son of Joseph” .”   That has been shown not be a fact at all, but as I said earlier, only hearsay and doubtless incorrect.  In order for there to be 1 in 10 ossuaries with the pairings of ‘Jesus’ and ‘Joseph’ inscribed on them, then 1 in 3.16 males in 1st century Jerusalem would need to have had one of those two names.  That is clearly not the case.  ‘Jesus’ and ‘Joseph’ may have been as common as Bob, Jack, Charlie, Bill, Bruce or Trevor in modern day western society, but certainly not as common as he implied.   \nAs at 1994, out of 231 inscribed ossuaries held by the Israeli Antiquities Authority, the name “Yeshua” appeared on only 10 ossuaries, and the name “Joseph” on only 19 of them.  The rate of occurrence might now have changed with further discoveries since then, but I should suspect hardly radically so.  Only two other ossuaries have been identified with an inscription corresponding to “Jesus son of Joseph”.  The rate is clearly not 1 in 10!  The ossuaries currently on hand, may be considered to be a sample of all 1st century ossuaries, including those yet remaining to be discovered.  There is no substantial evidence that 1 in 10 of all ossuaries in 1st century Jerusalem have that particular inscription, in fact quite the contrary.   \nI stand by my earlier claim, that out of any 100,000 similar sized families, perhaps only three such families had the identical combination of names as those inscribed on the Talpiot cache. \nTo make my position quite clear, I consider that Talpiot makes no challenge at all to Jesus having been buried in the tomb of Joseph of Aramathaea, that this tomb may well be the site of the current Holy Sepulchre church in Jerusalem, nor does it make a challenge to His resurrection from the dead, and no good case is made that he was married to anyone, nor that he sired a child.  All such attempted challenges in my view are utterly specious, for which there are adequate responses.\n\n","date":"April 6, 2015 at 3:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/05/easter-ink/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Easter Ink"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis has again misinterpreted my position.

Discard the joker.  Call all the spades cards “Jesus or Joseph”.  13 of the 52 cards (1 in 4) are spades.  There are 12 x 13 = 156 ways of drawing a pair of spades.  There are 51 x 52 = 2652 possible pairings altogether.  Then the chances of drawing a pair of spades = 156 / 2652 =  0.0588 … =  1 in 17.  So for there to be even a 1 in 17 chance of pairing “Jesus and Joseph”, 1 in 4 persons need to have one of those names.

It included the Upanishads, the Vedas, and the Bhagavad Gita.  Compared to the polytheisms in eastern and other religions, it seemed that the specific polytheism in Hinduism was more in the nature of “kathenotheism” or “one-god-at-a-time- ism”.  That is, all these various gods were really only different aspects of the Hindu concept of the One. \nRecently I attended a lecture by a retired Doctor of Divinity who referred to the ancient and medieval view of the three-tiered universe, with God above in the sky, earth in the middle, and Sheol below.  We now know that this concept is incorrect.  He preferred to think of everything existing “within God”.  That possibly comes close to Hindu and other eastern concepts.  \nThe Catholic historian Anne Fremantle referred to three fundamental heresies that have in various forms bedevilled Christian orthodoxy from its beginnings:  Pantheism, Polytheism and Prometheanism.  Pantheism confuses the Creator with Creation;  Polytheism confuses other supernatural beings with the one deity;  Prometheanism puts man in the place of God.  It is in avoiding these confusions that marks out Christian orthodoxy so distinctly from other religious expressions.  \nThe origins of various religions tend to follow a pattern:  the obvious one is a search for the mystical and divine beyond material reality;  another aspect can be found in the legitimisation of secular governance such as in the “mandate of heaven”, the religious coronation of kings who at one time had a distinctly priestly function, and is still evident in those nations with an establishment religion;  a third can be found in the various social mores of the particular culture as a form of social control.  \nWhile all of these different religions are part of man’s historic search for God, I feel that it is also part of the divine plan of God’s patient and persevering search for man to bring everything to Himself.  \nAs for distinctions between science and religion, they are both only distinct aspects of the one truth, and cannot fundamentally conflict.  Any perceived conflicts are only due to our limited finite understanding of the truth which with our limited understanding we find confusing.  The controversies following Darwin’s work on evolution is a case in point.  Established religion believed they had a correct view of Creation in the Genesis stories which were at odds with Darwin’s discoveries.  However Teilhard de Chardin was able to attempt a synthesis of the two concepts, but not without further controversy.  No doubt some new genius will eventually arise who can offer an even more successful synthesis of these two aspects giving us a theology which sees God as Creator in terms which the body of science might be able to more readily accept.\n\n","date":"April 27, 2015 at 4:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/25/flat-earth-society-shroud-of-turin-research-project-sturp-and-other-partisans/","cat":"article","title":"Flat Earth Society, Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) and Other Partisans"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Agricultural Man was long obsessed with the mystery and wonder of the annual fertility cycle, birth, death, rebirth.

The hymn is interpolated into the ‘Acts of Judas Thaddeus’ written in Edessa. The hymn tells how a prince the son of a king is divested of his shining robe, and is sent into Egypt to wrest a pearl from a serpent. He succeeds in snatching the pearl from the serpent, he returns home, and his robe now seems to be an image of himself. It is clearly an analogy of Christ sent to redeem humanity from Satan. \n“On a sudden, as I faced it, The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself. I saw it all in my whole self, Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it, For we were two in distinction And yet again one in one likeness. And the image of the King of kings Was depicted in full all over it…”  \nIt would therefore seem that Bardaisan had seen the full body image of the Shroud at the time that Bishop Avercius Marcellus, primate of Hieropolis, was sent by Pope Eleutherius to baptize Abgar VIII and his court at Abgar’s request, and given temporary custody of the Shroud from Antioch using it as a kind of visual aid for his mission. Other royal scribes wrote up the incident as an analogy, the ‘Doctrine of Addai’, including it in the royal archives, and relating it to an earlier king Abgar V Ukkama, to conceal its true meaning from the despotic anti-christian emperor Septimius Severus who succeeded the more tolerant emperor Commodus in 193AD, after the baptisms had occurred.    \nIt would seem that the noted Gnostic-Christian Bardaisan considered the Shroud image as authentic enough for him to write his hymn, and it would therefore seem to give the lie to any hypothesis that the Shroud was some kind of synthetic artifact created using some unknown and unspecified process by any Gnostic technologist of the 2nd century.\n\n","date":"April 9, 2014 at 7:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/08/lawrence-e-schauf-for-the-prosecution-the-trial-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","title":"Lawrence E.

During the period 1969-76, a secret commission appointed by Cardinal Pellegrino attempted to analyse the stains on the Shroud.  The several scientists included Prof Frache at Modena (forensics & blood), Prof Filogamo at Turin (blood-analysis).  At that time the normal tests for blood included: Peroxidase method commonly used to detect hemoglobin; benzidine turns blue, phenolphthaline turns pink; tests unsuccessful; failed to dissolve granules with acetic acid, oxygenated water, glycerin of potassium.  Clearly they faced a problem which they were not able to resolve at that time.  When their work was put to Adler around 1978, he had at that time had achieved some success with examining blood under UV light and with the resulting fluorescence. \nThe tests that Adler was able to perform seem to have been constrained by the inability to put these ancient stains into solution by the normal methods used when faced with a recent sample.

Mario shows the cloth loosely draped over the head, but a few of us were not convinced.  You need to go to Shroudscope;  You can measure the dimensions between the various features.  Using a tape measure, find the distance between the tip of your nose and the bump on the back of your head; It’s probably about 37 cm – 40 cm.  Try to identify these features on shroudscope and measure the distance.  I think you might be persuaded that the cloth was placed firmly over the top of the head.  Why then is there no top-of-head image?  Possibilities: (i) type of funerary cap or jaw strap masking the Shroud cloth; (ii) the imaging process acted near vertical only;  (iii) a mystery.    \n3)  Orthogonality of the image, no imaging of sides:  Loose draping of the cloth, with the intention to complete the burial rites after the sabbath might be a sufficient explanation, but a few believe that the wrapping would have to be completed on the day of burial regardless.  That means the imaging process would have to be constrained vertically.  I’ve previously been an advocate of a paper by Giovanna de Liso, (a protegee of Giuilo Fanti), who carried out a lot of research on imaging caused by seismic action in Piedmont.  She seems to have obtained images which may be associated with seismic variations in geomagnetic & geoelectric fields, but many are not persuaded by it.  Nevertheless I think it’s possible that there may be something in it.  Otherwise we seem to be left with either a miraculous explanation or some unknown process by an artisan.\n\n","date":"October 17, 2015 at 5:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I consider that David Roemer’s concept of logic is deeply flawed. \n“Are you aware of the fact that two books were written by atheists using the authenticity of the Holy Shroud to explain the Resurrection of Jesus historically?”\nEqually it can also be said that many Christians see in the ‘authenticity of the Shroud’ a conclusive proof of the Resurrection: the fact that the image had to be formed within 40 hours of death, has not been distorted or effaced by subsequent corruption, and yet there is no body.  The fact that atheists may use the Shroud to interpret and rationalise the scriptural texts as an explanation of what the women and apostles believed about the resurrection is no argument.  Christians have recourse to the Scriptures to explain their belief, and yet the devil may also quote scripture, check out the Temptation of Jesus in the desert recorded in Matthew. \nI first came across the “Hymn of the Pearl” during the 1980s while studying ‘Ancient Religions’ under Dr Brian Colless of the Religious Studies Dept of Massey University in NZ, and using his own translations of several ancient texts from a variety of sources, Babylonian, Iranian, Phoenician and others. \nDr Colless has a view that the ‘Hymn of the Pearl’ may in fact be Iranian and does not seem to consider the possibility that it is Syriac, that it may even be more Christian than Gnostic, but that may be arguable.  It is not necessarily a view held by other experts in ancient literatures. For example Markwardt cites sources that attribute it to Bardaisan, the notable Christian-Gnostic hymnodist of Edessa during the reign of Abgar VIII.

Some have argued that if a burial commenced before sunset on the eve of a sabbath, then completion of many of the rites was permitted, including wrapping of the corpse.  Assuming authenticity, that creates real problems on the question of image orthogonality, and the action would have to be constrained vertically. \nI mentioned De Liso’s paper, and I think it a great pity that many of her findings seem to have suffered lack of follow-up by others, except for some rather absurd speculations.  One of the effects of earthquakes is the release of radon gas from within the earth, a radioactive inert gas, one of the decay products from uranium.  It is very common in apartment basements, a leading cause of cancer, and is also used in its treatment.  De Liso only ever obtained seismic images in the presence of radon gas, along with variations in the electro-magnetic fields.  Regardless of whether or not the imaging was caused by radiation, I think it possible that the radon may have had some kind of collimation effect resulting in the orthogonality.  It is obviously just speculation, but otherwise it is all part of the intriguing mystery.  \n“Shroud-like image formation during seismic activity”; Giovanna de Liso; ENEA Frascati Conference May 2010.\nhttp://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DeLisoWeb.pdf\nUnfortunately the PDF is in secure format, and so it’s impossible to do any copy and paste of any extracts without retyping.  \nBecause of the forensic investigations, I cannot accept that a statue or bas-relief was used, and the medical knowledge would not have been available in medieval times, and so I consider it was of a real human body.  Imaged cloths, a few “not made by human hands”, were known in Constantinople until 1204, after which they disappeared.  My fundamental objection to the radiocarbon dating, is the setting aside of a valid sampling regime, along with other factors.  I suppose it might just be remotely possible that it arrived in medieval times as a miraculous gift from heaven, but prior history and other evidence argues against it.\n\n","date":"October 17, 2015 at 3:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thanks O.K.

The Byzantine emperor Heraclius recaptured it in 627 taking it first to Constantinople, and then returning it to Jerusalem.  \nAlthough hidden for many years, the relic made its reappearance in 1099 during the first Crusade.  In 1187 a Frankish army under Guy de Lusignan was camped at Sepphoris and carried it into battle against Saladin.  The crusaders were utterly routed on the Field of Hattin, and Saladin paraded the relic through the streets of Damascus in triumph.  The cross-beam was eventually lost; fragments found their way back to Europe as Relics of the True Cross, some no doubt bogus.\nSepphoris is an ancient  city in Galilee, rebuilt by the tetrarch Herod Antipas, and is about 8 km north of the Nazareth of Jesus’ boyhood.\nAfter The Horns of Hattin, Saladin was master of the Moslem world, and rode through the streets of Damascus with the captured True Cross tied to his horse’s tail and dragging in the dust. Did his soldiers use it for firewood? \nDespite the valiant efforts of Richard I during the Third Crusade, the True Cross remained in Moslem hands. The beam itself disappeared, but fragments of the cross that came off were collected and brought back to Europe after the Crusades, some no doubt bogus.  \nAlthough the so-named True Cross was an inspiration and death sentence to many brave men of the time, no trace of the relic is believed to exist today. Was this focal point of the Crusaders, the True Cross as it was called. Perhaps we will never know. The important thing remains that for those soldiers who took up the cause of the Crusades, it was real enough to die for.\nThe “Titulus Crucis” the headboard relic taken by Helena to Rome is a related relic. It is either authentic, or else is a medieval replica of the authentic original. The original was known to exist for several hundred years.\n\n","date":"August 6, 2013 at 7:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/06/nbc-a-shroud-in-turin-is-said-to-hold-the-image-of-jesus-a-piece-of-jesus-cross-was-found/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"NBC:  A shroud in Turin is said to hold the image of Jesus & A piece of Jesus’ cross was found"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"O.K: Thanks for the additional info.

You should be able to pick up a copy from any good public library.  Even the Introduction to it by Sir Julian Huxley will give you a good overview.  Teilhard was a palaeontologist, and a Jesuit scholar.  His Jesuit superiors forbade him to publish during his lifetime, so that all his works are posthumous.  Teilhard seems to see the breakthrough as “cephalisation”, and he uses self-coined words like ‘noogenesis’ and ‘noosphere’ to signify the coming of consciousness.  \nOnly hydrogen, helium and some lithium could be formed as a consequence of the Big Bang, the lighter elements are formed as a result of nuclear reactions in stars up as far as Iron (atomic no. 26); all other heavier elements require a super-nova explosion to form, so we are actually made of star-dust.  \nUp until the 18th century it was believed that a ‘life-principle’ was required to form the more complex organic compounds.   In 1828 Friedrich Wohler announced he had succeeded in synthesising urea from ammonium cyanate without using a kidney, and this signified the commencement of organic chemistry. \nThe real brain teasers are “Why is there something rather than nothing?” and the mystery of consciousness.

This article did not touch on any theories of the history of the cloth, but a later article may do so.  An earlier article endeavoured to present material on some of the scientific aspects, and this can be found on the same web-site.  An attempt was made in the earlier article to be conservative in the scientific assertions made, and the more radical claims made by certain investigators were treated cautiously or left open.\nSources on crucifixion practices included the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and an article on the Herodians by Margaret J Thorpe.  A quotation from an early sceptic of the Shroud’s authenticity, a Jesuit historian Herbert Thurston, was also given.  A 3-D image from a very recent web-site was also used and cited.  Dr David Willis, one of the very few English investigators on the Shroud’s medical evidence was also quoted, and Dr Pierre Barbet’s papers were also of assistance.  \nI note that the exegetical advice given.on John 20:25-28 and Acts 12:7 does not appear to be quite accurate, as a better transliteration of the Greek root word for hand used in those texts is “kheiron-” (or “chiro-“), but this does not derogate from the principal argument used there.   \nI rather suspect that DA’s aversion to Ian Wilson derives from his disagreeing with Wilson’s theories or speculations on the history of the cloth.  However he can hardly disagree with Wilson’s presentation on the identification of the Shroud Man as Rabbi Yeshua, when even Herbert Thurston was prepared to concede this.  The question of identification is relevant, as tens of thousands were punished by crucifixion, and therefore identity is a fair question. \nI am not a blind follower of Ian Wilson’s theories.  My personal belief is that both Jack Markwardt and Daniel Scavone, although both disciples of Wilson, come closer to the mark, by asserting that the burial cloths were in Antioch for some centuries before arriving in Edessa, and that very likely Jeanne de Vergy came by the cloth through her ancestor Othon de la Roche, and that it was kept at Besancon, rather than being held in secret by the Templars as Wilson asserts.  Any attempt to resolve the whereabouts of the cloth after the sixth century must still deal with the matter of the Vignon markings on both coinage and iconography.  It is apparent that the Shroud image was then known.  If not in Edessa, where was it?  Noone has come up with an alternative theory, not even DA.  it was certainly not in “Neverland”!  \nI note that DA has asserted that the Byzantines did not appear to rate the burial cloth very highly as a relic as they kept it hidden.  I think that although he may know all there is to know about Byzantine sources, he may have failed to understand the Byzantine mind-set when it comes to the sacred.  He ought to know for example that the most sacred moments of eucharist worship are concealed from the common gaze, as contrasted with that in the western liturgies.  That says a lot about the Byzantine attitude to the sacred, which cannot be judged from a western stand-point.  I’m sure that he must already be aware of this, but it is not evident to me in what he writes.  And I think that is what I take exception to.\n\n","date":"July 10, 2012 at 8:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/09/new-article-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Article on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The next time DA wanders into the jungle, taking pot-shots at the wild life, chopping down trees, and over-turning the furniture, he should not be amazed if he encounters retaliation from conservation-minded cannibals!\n\n","date":"July 10, 2012 at 5:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/09/new-article-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Article on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Russ Breault’s emphasis on the Message of the Shroud, succinctly summarised in the Lauer paragraph extract above, is truly what matters.

Circles represented the mathematical ideal of curved orbits.  Eudoxus 400-350 BC, had proposed a model of 27 nested spheres as a geocentric model but which was inadequate for Venus and Mars.  Aristarchus of Samos 310-230 BC proposed a heliocentric model but was unable to win support except from Seleucus in Babylonia.  Eratosthenes 276-194 BC, a remarkable astronomer, director of the Great Library, calculated the earth’s diameter to within 15% from the sun’s solstice angle at Aswan, accurately measured the angle of the ecliptic, compiled a star catalog (lost), and a calendar including leap years.  Hipparchus d.~127 BC, gave the fatal blow by rejecting the heliocentric model, discovered precession of the equinoxes, calculated the year to within 6.5 minutes, compiled first known star catalog of 850 stars in six magnitudes as used today, and introduced the ideas of epicycles, eccentrics and deferrents, provided trig tables.  \nPtolemy’s Almagest in 13 books, (fl 127-145 AD), drew heavily on Hipparchus but modified his geocentric model, extended the catalog to 1022 stars.  The Ptolemaic system remained Western Christendom dogma until the time of Copernicus and Galileo.  \nAround 1609 Kepler had derived his laws of planetary motion and determined that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse.  He had written to Galileo, but Galileo refused to modify his theory of circular orbits.  Why?  Because he wished to preserve the theory of ideals as represented by circles! \nThe Copernican-Galilean-Kepler heliocentric model could only remain as an unproven hypothesis until the 19th century when it was finally proven by two major projects.  These were the quest for the discovery of stellar parallax from the extremities of the earth’s orbit, to which many astronomers dedicated their efforts but were frequently frustrated in their attempts by inadequate equipment and faulty conceptualisation.  It was only finally resolved by the realisation that corrections had to be made for the varying angle of light incidence from Alpha Centauri, an analogy realised from the change in wind direction when turning about while sailing up the Thames River.  The second project was Foucault’s erection of his pendulum suspended by a single filament in Paris demonstrating the actual rotation of the earth.  \nFrom the time of Aristarchus’ first proposing his heliocentric model to its final proof by stellar parallax and Foucault’s pendulum is some 2,200 years.  Secondo Pia displayed his first photographs of the Shroud in 1898.  How long might it be before the mystery of the Man of the Shroud will be resolved?  So many imagine that they have resolved the question already, but there is as yet no consensus.  Will it ever come?

A.M. van der Hoeven, http://www.JesusKing.info, October 14, 2011 \nAs Kelly states, Adrie makes a good credible case together with a plausible story for the Shroud having been a type of temple garment.  I was in touch with Adrie a few months ago, when she graciously contacted me.  One problem for many will be her associating the authors of the first and fourth gospels as being the same person, viz John Mark.  There is no tradition for the authors being the same person, and likely NT scholars would see valid objections to it.  So we differ on that aspect, but I don’t see that necessarily derogates from the Shroud having been a temple garment.  It might just as well have been the garment worn by Joseph of Arimathea, or even his own intended shroud.  \nPlain shrouds for burial did not become obligatory until the 2nd century under Gamaliel II, who objected to the excesses of luxuriant funerals, which sometimes resulted in pauperising families.  I see no reference to herring-bone weave, Z twist in her paper as being any kind of requirement.  Her biblical references as to requirements include Ex 28:5-6, Nu 15:38.  Other related papers can be found on her web-site above.  \nSignificant that white linen garments are frequently mentioned in both the OT and NT, so there must have been some degree of active production of them.  The inventiveness and enterprise of artisans, weavers and merchants for producing exceptional or special quality products of any genre is a common enough feature of any market-place.  Joseph is said to have been a rich man, and this might account for no other comparable linen cloths of similar weave being discovered.  The temple veil is said to have been torn in two as a result of an earthquake; whether Joseph or Nicodemus had access to its remnants is an intriguing speculation.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 3:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"On checking web-site “The Tabernacle Place”, the veil in the wilderness tabernacle is said to have been: “This curtain, known as the “veil,” was made of fine linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn.

It beggars belief that it could have been woven in one piece, and I’d presume it was made up of stitched segments.  If indeed it was a replica, then presumably it was of linen, but how it could have been four inches thick seems a puzzle, unless it was padded, but there might be objections to that if it involved two kinds of material. \nIt does indicate that large linen cloths were likely available, but I’d doubt that the TS was made from remnants of the temple veil, particularly if they were embroidered.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2015 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/11/shroud-the-reasons-for-the-no/","cat":"article","title":"Shroud: The Reasons for the ‘No’"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"In Ian Wilson’s 2010 text,  pp 71-72, he quotes Methchild Flury-Lemberg as claiming that the likely reason for the edge piece was to provide a tailored selvedge finish to the cloth.

It is calculated from the amplitude of the movement of seismographs and then standardised to a distance of 100km from the estimated epicentre. Yes there are other more sophisticated measures in use, more difficult and time consuming to calculate, but in theory they should yield pretty much more or less the same results. Shallow earthquakes will be felt to be more significant in their effects than deep earthquakes of the same intensity.  The intensity needs to be distinguished from the Modified Mercalli scale which gives a subjective measure of the effects of an earthquake at various places.  The intensity is an absolute measure of the earthquake, the Mercalli attenuates with distance from the epicentre. \nA quick Google on “Earthquakes in Israel” shows that it is moderately seismically active. In 2013 there were several shocks of around 3.5, In 1927 there was a 6.2 which killed 500, injured 700; and in 1837 an earthquake left 7000 dead.  The effects of an earthquake event will depend a lot on how well buildings and structures have been engineered against earthquake. There are various techniques commonly used, such as ensuring components are tied together, spiral reinforcing of columns, base isolation in foundations, and other standard techniques. The design philophy is usually to ensure the structure can survive a moderate earthquake, and in a severe earthquake will fail in a safe and controlled manner.  These techniques are commonly used in Japan, California and New Zealand, where earthquakes are most significant and there is a heightened awareness of their effects. In locations of only moderate seismicity, damage may be more severe, as there is often less awareness of what can be done, and sesimic design does not receive the same attention. \nThere are several problems with the Carpenteri et al paper published in Meccanica.  One is that the authors for some unknown reason have focused on the year 33AD, when they might have looked more closely at the year 30AD, possibly a more credible date for\nthe crucifixion. Most informed students of the Shroud are unlikely to accept the proposition that the crucifixion / resurrection earthquakes affected the 1988 radiactive carbon dating results.  It has never arisen with the dating of any other artifact, no less likely to have been so affected.  \nPersonally I can accept the possibility that sesimicity may have had a bearing on the formation of the Shroud image, for reasons I have given elsewhere.  But this is not to say that the image formation mechanism is as outlined by the authors. It is credible that the high energies involved in earthquakes may have released neutrons. But we have yet to see replication of images so formed.  The images produced by De Liso apparently required the release of radon gas, which produces gamma radiation, not neutrons. There were other necessary components as well including concurrent variations in the geo-magnetic and electric fields. \nWith all the talk and theories of image formation, there has been a sad lack of attempts at persuasive experiments to produce images on linen cloth from cadavers, or even from time-expired laboratory test animals.  The best De Liso could come up with was a dead snake and a metallic key.  A more concerted effort is required if the various theories are ever to be brought to any kind of conclusion.  \nScriptural references to the crucifixion / resurrection earthquakes:  Matt 27:51 (crucifixion), 28:2 (resurrection) (specific); Mk 15:38 is suggestive (veil of temple torn in two); Luke 21:45 (likewise); John does not refer to darkness nor earthquake.\n\n","date":"February 17, 2014 at 6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/16/the-shroud-of-turin-story-brings-up-all-the-usual-issues-about-click-bait-journalism/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Shroud of Turin story brings up all the usual issues about click-bait journalism"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"John, I can certainly agree with the notion that the Shroud was Christ’s gift to humanity in general.  But if it is to be debated as to who should possess it as an earthly object or as a property right, then I believe that a good case can be made for St Peter having first claim, and it does not have to be on any kind of finders-keepers basis.  \nWe do not need to debate the primacy of Peter among the apostles, and I think we can assume that as given.  In John chapter 20, we read how “the other apostle” arrived at the tomb first and saw the linen cloths, but did not go in, but he gave way to Peter.  \n“4 They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first; 5 he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in. 6 When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there, 7 and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place. 8 Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed.” Jn 20:4-8 \nThe stone had been rolled away, and the tomb was now accessible to all and sundry, including the Roman and Jewish officials.  The burial cloths were still there, and they had held the body of their master.  What to do with them?  As head of the apostles, I think Peter would see it as his duty to take possession of them.  There is good testamentary evidence that he did precisely that, even taking them to Antioch when they eventually abandoned Jerusalem, and where he became its first bishop.  I know that some sources give a variety of versions as to what happened to the cloths, including one involving Pilate’s wife, while others say that they were given to Peter.  Peter’s custodianship tends to be corroborated by various subsequent writers.  I think he has the best claim.

Extract from my notes of 2008: \n“He discounts the birth stories in Bethlehem and concludes that, very likely, Jesus was born and grew up in Nazareth;  His education in Galilee would probably be limited to that attainable by an eldest son of a tradesman, he essentially spoke Aramaic, with only sufficient Greek for commercial transactions, and likely some Hebrew.  Meier discusses the fourth century doctrines of Mary’s perpetual virginity, but considers that the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus mentioned in the gospels are in fact blood-brothers or sisters of Jesus – he refers to the typical use of the Greek word adelphos (brother or half-brother) rather than other terms (e.g. anepsios) in common use for relationships such as cousin or step-brother – thus he rejects Jerome’s and other patristic interpretations of these relationships. ”  \nIt is based on the evangelists’ use of the word adelphos, when another common word “anepsios” would have sufficed if they were cousins.  However it occurred to me that adoption was very common in this period, because of the high mortality rates, and the general prevalence of orphans.  Under both Jewish and Roman Law, adoptees had precisely the same legal rights as those of natural descent.  It is fairly easy to find examples where emperors adopted sons and these succeeded to the imperial throne.  Under those circumstances, “adelphos” would be the appropriate term.  Other interpretations would tend to strain too much at the meaning of “adelphos”.  It is interesting that St Paul makes much of the notion that we are all made sons by adoption, and consequently heirs to Christ.  \nA direct quote from Meier’s summary “Roots of the Person”, chapters 8, 9, 10: \n“During the reign of Herod the Great, and probably towards its end (ca. 7-4 BC), Jesus was born in the hill town of Nazareth in Lower Galilee.  His mother was Mary, his putative father, Joseph.  We hear of four brothers of Jesus (James, Joses, Jude, and Simon) and at least two unnamed sisters.  It may be significant that all the names in the family hark back to the glorious days of the patriarchs, the exodus, and the conquest of the Promised Land.  Jesus’ family may have shared in the reawakening of Jewish and national and religious identity that looked forward to the restoration of Israel in its full glory.  That is all the more likely if Joseph claimed to be a descendant of King David.  At any rate, judging by the fiercely religious focus of Jesus’ life once it becomes visible to us, we may reasonably suppose that his family had been deeply devout Jews of a peasant Galilean type: firmly committed to the basic practices of the Mosaic Law (especially to its “boundary symbols” of circumcision, Sabbath, and pilgrimage to the Jerusalem temple), but not given to the niceties of Pharisaic observance. ”\n“As the firstborn son, Jesus would have been the object of Joseph’s special attention, both in training him for a trade and in seeing to his religious education.  The fact that Joseph is notably absent during the public ministry is best explained by the traditional idea that he had already died.  Jesus’ mother, brothers, and sisters survived into the period of the ministry, though not without some tensions between themselves and Jesus.”\n“We are specifically told by various evangelists that the family thought Jesus mad (Mk 3:21), or that his brothers did not believe in him (Jn 7:5), or that Jesus refused a request of his family to see him (Mk 3:31-35).  It is therefore all the more startling, when we glance ahead to the history of the early Church, to find Jesus’ brother James prominent in an early creedal formula listing witnesses to the resurrection (1 Cor 15:7) and in the leadership of the Jerusalem church (Gal 1:19; 2:9, 12) Acts 15:13-21; 21:18) – with other family members following in his steps.”\n“In the face of all this information about members of Jesus’ family, the total silence about a wife or children is best taken as indicating that Jesus chose the highly unusual – but not unknown – path of celibacy.”\n“Growing up in Nazareth, Jesus would have spoken Aramaic as his everyday tongue, while also learning some Hebrew from the local synagogue services, and perhaps more Hebrew from formal instruction provided by his father.  As he started to learn the trade of woodworker from Joseph, he would have found it useful, or even necessary to acquire some Greek phrases for business purposes.  Frequent visits by his family to Jerusalem for the great feasts would have exposed him to more Greek in that polyglot city.  Although he might have used Greek when dealing with Gentiles, and Hebrew when debating the meaning of Scripture with professional Scribes, the bulk of his teaching, directed as it was to ordinary Palestinian Jews, would have been delivered in Aramaic.”\n“Jesus’ teaching was delivered orally, and oral teaching could in theory have been the sole conduit of Jesus’ own education in the Scriptures and Jewish traditions.  In the oral popular culture in which he grew up and later taught, literacy was not an absolute necessity for common people.  Yet the matrix of a devout Jewish family, Jesus’ own preoccupation with the Jewish religion, and the debates over Scripture that Jesus held with professional scribes and pious Pharisees during his ministry all make his ability to read the sacred text a likely hypothesis.” \n“Jesus the woodworker of Nazareth was poor by our modern American standards, though relative to his own society he was no poorer than the vast majority of Galileans.  Actually, not knowing the grinding destitution of the dispossessed farmer, the city beggar, the rural day labourer, or the rural slave, he was not at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder.  While we would find the economic and political realities of Antipas’ Galilee unbearable, they were on the whole preferable to the chaotic last days of Herod the Great, the chaotic first days of the Jewish War in the late sixties, or the sense of oppression by foreigners that the presence of the Roman prefect aroused in Judea.” \nThere is more, and much of it dismisses the more fanciful and even some popular notions concerning this marginal Jew.\n\n","date":"September 29, 2015 at 9:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/28/the-shroud-of-canterbury/","cat":"article","title":"The Shroud of Canterbury"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"My notes above on adoption give a satisfactory explanation for the evangelists’ use of the word “adelphos” and provide a way of leaving intact the doctrine of Mary’s perpetual virginity.

Because of Church prohibitions on dissection, there was no further progress with Anatomy, and Galen’s work was the only authority available until Leonardo began his own dissections in the 16th century.  \nForensic pathologists have considered that the figure of the image is anatomically genuine, and given that the Shroud was first exhibited in the West in 1355, well before the time of Leonardo, it seems difficult to able to assert that sufficient anatomical knowledge was then available for it to be a work of human art.

The biblical account indicates two sightings of the star, one before the wise men began their journey (probably from Babylonia or Persia) and the other near their journey’s end, when the omen “came and stood over where the young child was.” A celestial object near the horizon of any given observer might be considered by him as pointing out some spot on Earth below.\nChinese annals record novae in 5 BC and 4 BC; in the early 17th century, Johannes Kepler advanced the view that the Star of Bethlehem may have been a nova occurring in or near some conjunction of bright planets.\nSeveral striking planetary conjunctions also took place within 10 years of the chronological point now taken as the beginning of the Christian era. A triple conjunction in early 6 BC, in which Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn stood at the points of a triangle, has often been mentioned as a possible explanation of the star. Prior to that, in 7 BC, Jupiter and Saturn were for eight months within three degrees of each other and three times within that period passed within one degree. Several years later, on June 17, 2 BC, the bright planets Venus and Jupiter would have appeared to observers in Babylon to have merged just before setting in the general direction of Bethlehem to the west.  \nAlternatively, interpret it as a literary device.  Several notable people in ancient times were said to have had asterism phenomena at their birth as a signal portent.  Matthew’s gospel is noted for several allusions to gentiles, some favourable, others less so.  If he wants important gentiles at the birth of Jesus, a sign from a star gives them a reason for their journey.\n\n","date":"June 30, 2015 at 2:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/25/who-is-he/","cat":"article","title":"Who Is He?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Louis & Jesterof may be interested in this little known case of incorruption in NZ which I only discovered this evening from an article in our archdiocesan newspaper.  The article is by Mgr John Broadbent, a highly regarded church historian in NZ. It concerns Fr Antoine Marie Garin, 1810-89, a French Marist missionary to NZ associated with Bishop Pompallier, and a major founder of Catholic education here, particularly in the Nelson province (Ernest Rutherford country). I’ve since discovered other material about Fr Garin, including a college student’s competition essay, but Fr Broadbent’s piece will have the authority of proper historical research behind it.  \nThe full article can be found at:\nhttp://wel-com.org.nz/wel-com-articles/3633-catholic-pioneers-fr-antoine-marie-garin and includes a portrait by noted artist Goddfried Lindauer. The article concludes:\n“Following his death on 14 April 1889 Fr Garin was buried in a temporary grave in Nelson’s Wakapuaka cemetery [I have a great-grandfather buried there (db)]; the whole district wanted to build a memorial chapel over his remains. The body was disinterred 18 months later and found to be completely intact, though the vestments had rotted.” “It is now buried under heavy concrete in the chapel’s crypt.”\nElsewhere it is stated that although the coffin was water-logged and his vestments had rotted, Fr Garin’s body was incorrupt, a number of winesses signing an affidavit to this effect.

It has lost its way, unable to tell truth from myth and even challenging whether there can be such a reality as objective truth.  Whether Erman’s book will find a postive response among the hallowed halls is an open question.\nThe origins of this general decay in Academia can probably best be traced to two French clowns Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, who by their theories of deconstructionism became the leading exponents of what has come to be known as the post-modernist school of philosophy.  The principal feature of this movement is that it is largely unintelligible and incoherent to any reasonable minded person,  Its second characteristic is its assertion that there is no objective truth, which is the principal reason why I fear that Erman’s book will fail to engage.  It is easily seen therefore that such a philosophy is necessarily the spawn of the father of lies!\nNotwithstanding its general incoherence, post-modernism has become extremely influential in shaping much social thinking and the soft sciences in current western thought, their outgrowths, and the so-called “mythicists” mentioned in this title posting are merely one more symptom of it.\nThere is an objective truth, for Jesus said “I am.the Way, the Truth and the Life”, and his followers not only knew him, and that he certainly existed, but they  laid down their lives for what he taught, for who he was, and in asserting his resurrection.

From 1948 until his retirement in 1972, Frei was head of the Zurich Police Scientific Laboratory.  He had worked on many important crimes and accidents including the air crash which killed UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold.  Although retired, Frei was still in 1978 consulted on crimes by police forces of many nations.  He had established an international reputation for himself by the analysis of microscopic substances.  Up until that time it seems that the more usual application of palynology had been confined to the examination of core samples for archaeology and palaeontology purposes.  Frei first became involved with the Shroud in 1973 under Cardinal Pellegrino’s Turin Commission, and was appointed for the purpose of notarising the photographs taken by Judica-Cordiglia in 1969.  Frei had previously published an article on the faking of photographs in 1955.  He was given his first permission to take his sticky tape samples at this time in 1973. \nWilson makes the point that, although Frei was initially skeptical about the authenticity of the Shroud, this skepticism had gone as a result of his own work, an admission which apparently caused him some emotion.  His upbringing was Zwinglian Protestant, and he was far removed from Catholic leanings.  \nIn his 2010 book, Wilson traces some of the subsequent history of the pollen investigations including the involvement of Whanger, Danin, Baruch and Litt.  Wilson concludes: “While there remains good reason to believe the fundamental soundness of Frei’s identifications, the argument for the presence of Middle Eastern pollen grains on the Shroud can no longer be advanced with quite the assurance it could thirty years ago.”  It seems to be a most unusual and almost self-contradictory conclusion.\n\n","date":"August 24, 2014 at 5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/22/coming-out-of-the-closet-on-pollen-and-plant-images/","cat":"books","title":"Coming Out of the Closet on Pollen and Plant Images"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Comprehensive article on Faidherbia albida is at:\nhttp://database.prota.org/PROTAhtml/Faidherbia%20albida_En.htm \nArticle’s geographic emphasis is mainly Africa where it seems pervasive and is highly valued there for a variety of purposes, but it does occur as far north as Israel.

Gian M Rinaldi’s comments above answer that to some extent, but do not address the specifics of Frei’s Shroud pollen samplings but rather other matters where it is asserted that Frei failed.  In his criminal work, Frei was clearly a pioneer.  He was following the methods of Edmond Locard who established the first ever police laboratory at Lyon in 1910.  Locard was famous for his important doctrine in criminology that “every contact leaves a trace”, which was the principal that Frei was following in applying his sticky tapes to recover pollen samples.  So it was pioneering investigation methods that he was attempting.  \nEven from Hugh Farey’s paper and the other investigators who have had access to Frei’s tapes, I am still left with the impression that there remains a residuum sufficient to corroborate a Jerusalem sojourn for the Shroud, and clearly this had to be some time before 1355.

John’s gospel has it that the Friday was Preparation Day before an important festival; that year Passover was to fall on the sabbath which made it special.  What was the state of the Jerusalem markets that Friday afternoon?  Had they closed early for a public holiday? How could he purchase it in the limited time available to him?  Was it originally intended as Joseph’s own burial shroud?  A. van der Hoeven published a paper suggesting that it may have been John Mark’s temple garment, and the same cloth dropped by him in the garden when he fled naked; she suggests that it was recovered by the guards, and that Joseph retrieved it when he went to seek permission from Pilate; which makes it close to writing a novel; but she does have a case that it may have been a temple garment.  Or did Joseph use it as such.  Charles has mentioned that most Middle East weaving thread was spun as “S” twist, whereas the Shroud’s linen is “Z” twist.

In addition to his medical qualifications in forensics Barbet was also a competent scholar in the classics, Latin & Greek.  He quotes several authorities: Horace, Seneca, Petronius, Artemidorus, Cicero etc.  \nThe usual practice was for corpses to remain on the cross to be devoured by birds of prey and wild beasts.  However the bodies could be asked for by families who wished to ensure a decent burial.  It seemed to Barbet that the law authorised this without hindrance and without payment.  Even the ashes of those condemned to the stake were returned to their relations (Pandectes).  That such clemency was the rule is proven by cases where free authorisation is refused are pointed out as exceptions.  He quotes Cicero who bitterly reproaches Veres for extorting heavy payments for giving up bodies to families; he says that such extortion is against the law.  \nHowever a judge might refuse to surrender the body where there is hatred against the criminal, or in cases of high treason.

The IAA quoted this source in their attempts to rebut Talpiot as being “The Jesus Family Tomb”.  My purpose was to show that, despite these names being very common in 1st c Jerusalem, the likelihood markedly increased when the full Talpiot combination was considered.  In a population of 917 ossuaries, 286 names appeared on 231 inscribed ossuaries; 686 ossuaries were uninscribed.  Agreed that the relatively small sample of 286 names will introduce a sampling error when applied to the full Judean / Galilean population at the time, and it cannot be an exact calculation without knowing the full census of names.  However the principle that the likelihood is very much greater when a combination of 7 or 8 names is considered, instead of just individual names on their own certainly remains valid.  It is not a “very weak argument”, and it is not “misleading”!\n2. Re Max comment, March 7, 9:12am:\nYour words not mine.  You must draw your own conclusions. I couldn’t possibly comment!\nI hold a respectable degree in civil engineering, have had a fascinating 40 year career spanning a wide spectrum of engineering and management disciplines.  I also hold majors in mathematics and religious studies, and minors in literature and various other liberal arts disciplines and accounting management.  Before I lost my hearing, I also used to play Beethoven sonatas, and had several dramatic interests.  I have found this comprehensive approach to suit my temperament best, providing me with a well-rounded outlook, rather than having a narrow focus on an obscure specialty of my own invention!\n3. Re Ron comment, March 7, 10:15am:\nPresence of the carpal bone in the Jesus ossuary is highly suggestive of a wrist-nailed crucified victim, and could be expected.  To invoke the isaiah scripture “not a bone will be broken” is highly dubious, and is merely following a literalistic interpretation of an evangelist’s comment.  I don’t know that the carpal was in fact broken.\nThere is no known record of a Jesus family tomb in Nazareth, but there is a possible candidate at Talpiot.  After the resurrection, Matthew has the disciples returning to Galilee, whereas Luke has them staying in Jerusalem.  Certainly there were family members who were living in Jerusalem (e.g. James).  There are also various other traditions as well, some of them highly questionable, and merely supportive of claims made by various ancient churches.\nThe question of the James ossuary remains contentious.  Excavation work at the site was hindered by ultra-Orthodox rabble indulging in their regular pastime of stoning the archaeologists.  The work at the site had to be hurried, and it is credible that errors were made.  The IAA initiated a vindictive prosecution for fraud against the collector Oded Golan, probably because he was suspected to have been involved in the antiquities black market.  The IAA was later obliged to abandon their case against him.  The Golan “James” ossuary was taken to Canada and subject to various scientific tests – electron microscope, ultra-violet – and the inscription dated to 63AD, the year of St James martydom,  Subsequent tests showed that the patina on this ossuary matched the patina on the other Talpiot ossuaries.\nConcerning the so-called Mary Magdalene ossuary, this is just one of the outrageous claims made by Jacobovici, which does nothing to enlighten the case.  If Talpiot is indeed the family tomb, the presence of the “Judah son of Jesus” ossuary can be explained by the prevalent practice of adopting orphans, possibly the credible sort of compasionate action that Rabbi Yeshua might well have done. I’ve commented elsewhere about this.\nI am not asserting that Talpiot is definitely the “Jesus Family Tomb”, and surely there are vested interests contaminating the case; Although I find the combination of names reasonably persuasive.  But there are enough signposts to show how badly the whole business has been mishandled, and sufficient doubt remains as to justify being more open-minded about the possibility, than the rantings of fundamentalist Christians who imagine that their cherished beliefs are being over-turned in reacting to allegations that are not even asserted.\n4. Re Yannick comment, March 7, 4:52pm:\nThis has to be one of the more coherent cases that I have seen Yannick make in respect of the Mandylion and Shroud being two separate objects, although I don’t necessarily agree with his conclusions.\nThere was more than one cloth taken from Edessa to Constantinople.  In the summer of 944 AD, the Emperor deputed Abraham, bishop of Samosata to receive the Mandylion.  Apparently he recognised the Orthodox copy as spurious, and was only satisfied when he had the Monophysite and Nestorian copies also handed over to him.

I am gratified that I no longer seem to be in a minority of one, in being prepared to be open-minded about the possibility of the Talpiot site being indeed the Jesus Family Tomb.\nThe various outageous speculations of Jacobovici had the unfortunate effect of provoking a fairly predictable response from the Christian far-right, in such videos as “The Jesus Tomb Unmasked” as if the discovery of a Jesus ossuary had to be a denial of the resurrection, whereas the Pellegrino comments clarifies the situation, and even adds to the case.  It is to be expected that wrist-nailing would indeed pop out a few carpal bones, such as the one found there.\nLikewise, it is also to be expected that the IAA would also wish to cover their butts, considering the incompetence with which they seemed to have dealt with this site and the artifacts found there, a potentially highly significant finding for primitive Christian historiography.\nMuch is made in the “Jesus Tomb Unmasked” video of how common in 1st c Judaism were the particular names found at Talpiot.  However they conveniently avoid the question of the particular combination of names.\nOf the 10 ossuaries registered, 6 were incribed with a total of 7 names.  If the James ossuary is included (it has the same patina as the others), then there were 8 names.\nHere are the frequencies(f) of the names found, that are included in a total population of 231 ossuaries with 286 names:\nMary (Miriam, Maria): f = 20, p = 6.99%; Talpiot occurrences x = 2;\nJesus (Yeshua) f = 10, p = 3.50%, x = 1;\nJoseph (Yosa) f = 19, p = 6.64%, x = 2;\nJudah (Judas, Yehuda) f = 18, p = 6.29%, x = 1;\nMatthew (Mattitiyahu, Mattai) f = 8, p = 2.80%, x = 1.\nGiven that there is a collection of 1st c Jewish ossuaries inscribed with seven names at random, then the combined probability of obtaining the Talpiot combination falls to:\nP = 8.73 x 10^(-5) = 1 in 11,456.\nIf the exercise is reworked to include the James ossuary, then the probability falls to 1 in 38,140.\nSo that considering the combination as such, changes the likelihood completely from that peddled by the deniers.\nIt is now probably far too late to obtain any other useful or meaningful scientific evidence about this case, as the ossuaries have been cleaned of their contents which have been placed in some common grave.  The only thing that can be hoped for, is to look for some textile match between the fibre traces and the Shroud or Sudarium artifacts.  I’m not aware of any progress in any such attempt.\nAlthough the body of Jesus may have been originally laid in some other tomb close to Golgotha, (Holy Sepulchre???) it seems not unreasonable that his burial cloths and any other residue, should be placed in an ossuary at a family tomb.  The cloths after all were unclean and a place had to be found for them in accordance with prescribed requirements. Joseph of Aramathea might well have been the kind of wealthy patron who would be prepared to make such provisions for Jesus’ family.\nI think it is a shameful scandal the way this whole matter has been treated, and it reflects no professional credit on anyone involved with it.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2012 at 3:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/even-more-on-archaeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Even more on Archaeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, Your words not mine.

And there are many comments that could be made about it.  Creation of ley lines was a common practice in ancient times (Iron Age), and there are several examples in Britain.  Their retention into medieval times was accomplished by siting churches, monasteries, cross-roads and other notable features on the old sites.  As well as linking various ‘sacred sites’ (e.g. stone circles) they had a practical use as aids to path finding for travellers, a sort of ancient GPS, and adjcaent features were inter-visible determined by the visible horizon, roughly 22 miles.  Stephen Skinner’s “Sacred Geometry” gives a good description of them. Modrn surveying has demonstrated that they were set out extremely accurately for their time. \nLinking the Shroud with the Holy Grail, Joseph of Arithmathea with Glastonbury / Avalon, and Arthurian legends, seems to have originated from about the time of the crusades, from about the twelfth century.  \nEncyc Brit comments re Avalon: “Avalon – island to which Britain’s legendary king Arthur was conveyed for the healing of his wounds after his final battle. It is first mentioned in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae (c. 1136), while the same author’s Vita Merlini (c. 1150) described it as “the island of apples [‘Insula pomorum’], called fortunate.” It was ruled by the enchantress Morgan le Fay and her eight sisters, all of them skilled in the healing arts.”\n“Geoffrey may have been attempting to connect his “island of apples” with Celtic mythology’s traditions of an elysium; and the name Avalon is certainly close to the Welsh word for apple, afal. Sir John Rhys, however (Studies in the Arthurian Legend, 1891), preferred to link the name Avalon with that of Aballach, a (hypothetical) dark Celtic divinity. Avalon has been identified with Glastonbury in Somerset, and this may be connected with Celtic legends about an “isle of glass” inhabited by deceased heroes. It is equally likely to have been an attempt by the monks of Glastonbury to exploit the Arthurian legend for the benefit of their own community.” \nJack Markwardt’s two papers linking the Shroud with his Antioch theory, provides comment on the linking of the Grail story with the Shroud and Britain.  It seems to have resulted from a mistranslation referring to an alleged British king, but which actually may refer to Abgar the Great.\n“A sixth-century entry in the Liber Pontificalis records that Pope Eleutherius, whose papacy extended from approximately 174 to 189, “received a letter from British King Lucius [Britannio rege Lucio] asking that he might be made a Christian through his agency In 731, the Venerable Bede reiterated this precise account and further reported that Eleutherius’ compliance with the king’s request for baptism ―was soon effected.  Nevertheless, because second-century Britain was under Roman rule and had no king, these two texts presented a historical conundrum, one which remained unsolved for almost fourteen centuries and until 1904, when Adolph Harnack, a respected Biblical scholar, deduced that the Liber Pontificalis entry had been intended to reference not Britain, but, rather, the Britio Edessenorum, Edessa’s citadel, and not King Lucius, but King Lucius Ælius Septimius Megas Abgarus VIII of Edessa, otherwise known as Abgar the Great.”  \n“Hints of a lost Syrian sindonic history are to be found in the legends of the Holy Grail, an object which, in recent years, has been increasingly linked to the Shroud. Some seventy-five years ago, Professor Eisen concluded that the earliest Grail legends attempted to account for the loss of real sacred objects known in fourth-century Syria and that these stories reflected a passionate desire to locate and recover such objects from concealment.”\n“A mere seventy years after Crusaders had discovered the Holy Lance in Antioch, Chretien de Troyes wrote the first of Western Europe’s Grail romances and coupled the mysterious Grail with a bleeding white lance. Soon thereafter, Robert de Boron mentioned an image of Christ on a shroud, identified the chalice as the Grail, and related that Joseph of Arimathea, the Shroud’s first owner, had died in Syria,  in stark contrast to later tales which, integrated with the Arthurian legend, placed him in Britain.”  \nMarkwardt’s two papers: “ANCIENT EDESSA AND THE SHROUD: HISTORY CONCEALED BY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SECRET” 2008, http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers/p02.pdf \n“Antioch and the Shroud” 1998, Dallas conference:\nhttp://www.shroud.com/pdfs/markward.pdf    \nSorry I had to spoil the fantasies!\n\n","date":"January 18, 2013 at 3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/18/facts-by-legends-rumors-and-imagination/","cat":"books","title":"Facts by Legends, Rumors and Imagination"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Glitch in my posting above:  WordPress doesn’t seem to like logic expressions!?\nIf 0.0699 greater than R, name Mary appears;\nIf 0.1364 greater than R greater than or equal .0699, name Joseph appears;\nEtc …\nIf R greater than or equal 0.2622, name does not qualify;\nOtherwise, results as reported above.\n\n","date":"March 7, 2012 at 4:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/05/even-more-on-archaeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Even more on Archaeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I read “The Jesus Family Tomb” back in 2008, and have regularly followed up web discussions, mainly hostile, since then,  Despite all the web hostility, I’m inclined to think that the Talpiot tomb was indeed the Jesus Family Tomb.  Randy makes a valid point above in quoting Pellegrino’s belief that no skeleton was ever placed in the Jesus ossuary, but only the burial cloths.\nThe case was not helped by Jacobovici’s highly dubious interpretation of some aspects of the case, including citing the aprocrophal “Gospel of Philip” and taking on board the Dan Green hypothesis that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were husband and wife, and that Judah was their son.\nThe various names of Jesus’ family members can be found in the gospels Mt 13:55, Mk 6:3.  The early 4th century Fathers in their doctrine of “Mary ever Virgin” asserted these were cousins of Jesus or other close relations.  John P Meier in “A Marginal Jew” is insistent that they were indeed brothers and sisters of Jesus, because of the gospels’ use of the Greek word “adelphos” in preference to “anepsios”,\nI’ve mentioned elsewhere on this site the extensive practice of adoption of orphans in 1st century Judaism and also throughout the Empire, because of the high mortality rates.  Under both Jewish and Roman Law, legal adoption created the same rights as did birth.\nMeier’s assertion can still maintain the “Mary ever Virgin” doctrine, if the various brothers and sisters were indeed adopted, and Mary and Joseph certainly seem to have been the compassionate type of people who muight well do this.  Likewise Judah could well have been the adopted son of Rabbi Yeshua, but the secret would be kept to avoid the implied threat to the lad’s life as son of “King of the Jews”\nThe case of the Talpiot tomb was badly handled by the Israeli Antiquities Authority from the very beginning, and they seem seldom to have ever shown any interest whatsoever in early Christian archaeology.\nNor was it helped by the casual treatment of the original 1980 discovery by the IAA, the challenge to cherished beliefs by protagonists of the Christian Right, archaeologists miffed that others were trespassing on their professional territory, and by a thriving black market in forgeries, each stake-holder having their own personal agenda on the discovery.\nThe opportunity to have explored one of the most potentially significant findings of early Christianity has now been irretrievably lost.  Pellegrino has expressed some hope that a match might be found between the Jesus ossuary fibre traces and the Shroud or Sudarium, but I’m unaware of any progress in this matter.\nThe IAA and other “nay sayers” have made much of the fact that the names on the ossuaries were very common in 1st c Judaism.  They conveniently overlook the unlikelihood of getting the full combination of names.  I carried out some probability analysis at the time together with some “Monte Carlo” simulation tests, based on the frequency of individual names found on 1st c ossuaries.  The odds for seven of the names occurring were calculated at 1 in 11,456;  If the James ossuary was also included, the odds worked out at 1 in 38,140.  It has to be significant!\nAs Pellegrino has said:  “If nothing else but an ossuary inscribed with the words ‘Jesus, son of Joseph’ were found in a tomb, bearing fibre evidence indicative of a missing body and two apparently sacred cloths, if these are indeed the two cloths described in John’s gospel, with a cross-mark attached to Jesus’ name, and a star on the lid – and if the antechamber bore a symbol known to the Jesuit order to this day as a glyph, translated as ‘Jesus Saviour of man’ – – if nothing else had been found, we would all be crazy not to look on with a sense of mystery and wonder.”\nBased on the precedent of the Talpiot Tomb discovery, I would not be too hopeful that the present work by Jacobovici and Tabor will receive any more sympathetic treatment, particularly if Jacobovici has pursued his usual tendency to flights of fancy.  If apostles are involved, we can for instance expect to see howls of anger from those ancient churches which still claim to hold their remains, whereas many of these claims are highly dubious.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2012 at 7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/fasten-your-seatbelt-more-archeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Fasten your seatbelt: More Archeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The use of ossuaries seems to have been fairly common in 1st c Palestine, from the time of say Herod the Great, but the practice ceased in 70AD.

The Simon of Cyrene ossuary has been definitely identified together with at least one of his sons (possibly both), as also has the ossuary of the high priest Caiaphas.  However some ossuaries included more than one set of bones, I think this may be true of the Caiaphas ossuary for instance.\nTypically about one year after burial, family would visit the tomb, and place the skeletal remains in a prepared ossuary.

I decided not to post a comment there as I have no wish to make all my personal details known to Google as required by their Sign-up process.\nThe video is yet another unfortunate example of how badly the whole business of Talpiot has been handled, including a whole lot of butt covering.\nMuch is made in the video of the incorrect allegation that the “bones of Jesus” had been discovered, whereas you’ll note in Randy’s posting at the head of this blog that no such assertion is made by Pellegrino, only some traces of fibres and a small hemispherical carpal bone in the Jesus ossuary.  The video chases this straw man diversion of “bones of Jesus” whereas it appears that there were virtually no significant skeletal remains at all.  Why were there no bones in this ossuary?  The answer is fairly obvious, but the video does not touch on this aspect at all, but responds to an allegation that in fact is not asserted.\nAgain, much is also made of the common use of the names found in 1st c Palestine.  I think I’ve already covered that aspect in my postings above.  The frequencies of the names used in my analysis were identical to those published in “L. Y. Rahmani, A Catalogue of Jewish Ossuaries, Israel Antiquities Authority and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (Jerusalem: 1994)”, probably the same source as used in the video.\nCertainly, the names were common, but when the full combination of names found is considered, the probability falls to very long odds indeed:  The odds for seven of the names occurring were calculated at 1 in 11,456; If the James ossuary is also included, the odds worked out at 1 in 38,140. It has to be significant!  Rather like the Lotto ticket analogy I mentioned.\nThe whole investigation was contaminated by Jacobovici’s quest for sensationalism, and his more outrageous statements which I’ve dealt with at length above.\nIt is now too late to pursue the investigation in any meaningful scientific way, unless a correlation between the ossuary fibres and the Shroud/Sudarium cloths can be taken further.\nI don’t see that there is a significant problem between the two different tombs at “Holy Sepulchre” and Talpiot; Holy Sepulchre, close to Golgotha may be where Jesus was laid, in accordance with tradition, but the osssuary with the burial cloths could still be taken to a family tomb at Talpiot.\nIncidentally, the James ossuary had an identical patina to the other ossuaries at Talpiot, suggesting that there may be more to it than admitted.\nThe whole business has been incompetently handled from the outset, and early Christian histiography is the poorer for it.  I will continue to have an open mind about it, but I do find the combination of names highly persuasive.\n\n","date":"March 2, 2012 at 5:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/fasten-your-seatbelt-more-archeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Fasten your seatbelt: More Archeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"When a tomb (or other archaeological site) is discovered during modern developmental work, the IAA becomes involved.  Any archaeological research involving burial sites is usually hampered by ultra-Orthodox Jews, so the work has to be done unduly quickly.  The IAA removes any ossuraries, any contents are buried in a common grave, and the ossuaries are then internally cleaned which removes practically all useful DNA information.  This happened in the case of Talpiot.  The “James” ossuary went missing, but was later found in the possession of a dealer, who was accused of fraud, although the case against him was eventually abandoned.\nAs with most tombs, Talpiot had at some time been plundered by thieves, and also had been entered by medieval Crusaders, who buried three skulls there, and may have also marked the entrance with the “Jesus, Saviour.of man” glyph (circle and chevron), unless it was done by early Christians.\nIf the “Jesus” ossuary had contained the Shroud, and other burial cloths, then one wonders when they might have been removed.  Both the Mandylion and Sudarium were known in the sixth century, so it seems unlikely that they were removed by the Crusaders, despite any thoughts that the Shroud may eventually have fallen into the hands of the Knights Templar.  One might fall back on the Abgar legend, or speculate that the thieves may have purloined the cloths off to early Christians.\nPossibly reasonable objections to Talpiot being the Jesus family tomb, include no mention of Nazareth or Galilee on the ossuaries, traditions that some of the family members were buried elsewhere, and the expensive costs involved for such an ordinary family.  We might speculate that if Joseph of Aramathea was prepared to fund a costly burial cloth for Jesus, he might also be seen as a wealthy patron to ensure a respectable burial place for the rest of the family.\nOne of the compelling or persuasive factors for me, is the very low probability of the combination of names, mentioned in my 7:27pm posting above,  Any player of a Numbers gambling game such as Lotto, knows that it is quite easy to draw one or two numbers of a combination, but the highest prizes are reserved for those who are able to beat the odds with a full line of six or seven qualifying numbers, which seems to be the case at Talpiot.\n\n","date":"March 2, 2012 at 4:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/01/fasten-your-seatbelt-more-archeology-from-tabor-and-jacobovic/","cat":"books","title":"Fasten your seatbelt: More Archeology from Tabor and Jacobovic"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Howse’s comment is vague, maybe he’s just uncomfortable with the whole idea of the Shroud, the 1988 C14 tests have resulted in a welter of negative perceptions about it, which will take a long while to dispel.

It is highly hydrophilic and can exist in crystalline and amorphous forms. The Fanti paper apparently asserts that the data from the calibration experiments demonstrate that the cellulose progressively degrades over long perionds of time and this can therefore be used for dating purposes.  I do not understand what is going on here, nor what in fact the experiments are supposed to be measuring. Perhaps someone more chemically enlightened can explain it. Are the chains breaking up into fewer glucose units? Are the glucose units giving up some of their water content? Are the proportions of crystalline and amorphous components varying? Or is there some other explanation? Apart from the C, O, H atoms there appear to be no other elements involved, and so I am not clear on what the various spectral analyses might mean.  One might guess that the various mechanical tests provide some measure of amorphous / crystalline proportions, perhaps water content, or even average chain lengths? \nEach of the various cloths used for calibration will have its own history, and the cellulose in each will therefore have reacted in different ways according to particular environments of exposures to light, temperature and humidity, as well as frequency of use, folding, and handling. Has consistency in the calibration results been demonstrated by various systematic samples from each cloth, or was only one sample from each cloth taken? \nA major reservation has to be that only one fibre of alleged provenance from the TS has been tested to demonstrate the final conclusion of a first century origin.  This is no better than what was done for the C14 tests, and some might say it does not even match that low standard. The wide scatter between the three methods used, have been averaged out to provide the first century result. Another verdict might be that the three methods would seem to yield inconsistent results.  \nEmpiricism is sometimes a last resort when a more rational scientific approach is unavailable or unyielding. It may often be seen in the social sciences, the softer sciences such as finance and economics, earth sciences and hydrology. It can only occasionally provide the starting point for a more rational scientific approach when convincing trends are adequately demonstrated.

Mme Fury-Lemburg is a universally recognised authority on textiles, and has worked intimately on the Shroud so that it is not strictly correct that Gabriel Val is the only authority that ever touched and saw the Shroud. The work of Orit Shamir seems mainly confined to the textiles found in the Christmas Cave at Qumran in connection with the Dead Sea scrolls. The linen textiles there were of a unique type confined to the Essenes. It seems that these particular linen textiles were indeed S spun. Diana Fulbright’s work as an archaeologist in the Judean desert provides ample evidence that linen there also included Z spun. She provides adequate photographs and citations. I would surmise that the particular spinning type would be reasonably recognisable by a person of her competence. \nI am aware of Andrea Nicolotti’s antipathy towards the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin.

I look for consistency, not endeavouring to prove one feature from another. All four evangelists mention Joseph of Arimathaea. Matthew and Luke are probably sourcing Mark. However John’s independent gospel also mentions him and includes Nicodemus. That is close to corroboration. Luke adds the gloss “”He had not consented to what the others had planned and carried out”, which discounts the assertion that he has voted against Jesus. \nThe story does not smell to me of invention, partly because it is not an obvious story to invent, as indicated in your comments. I am happy to place other interpretations on the text, that “he bought fine linen” as a possible form of literary shorthand for some other kind of acquisition. I have suggested other possible sources above, one view being that it was at one time a temple garment, possibly John Mark who some say was the Sanhedrin secretary (see van der Hoeven), possibly even Joseph’s own garment, or possibly even intended as Joseph’s own burial shroud. It is not so incredible that a wealthy Jew, even the putative Joseph of Arimathaea, should be able to lay his hands on a fine linen cloth even on Preparation Day. Burial was one in fact one of the few works permitted on the sabbath. \nThe assertion that the Shroud of Turin doesn’t match with funeral clothes in 1st century Palestine may rest on the fragments of one solitary plain weave shroud discovered by Israeli and British archaeologists (yet another case of a single sample being used for purposes of false generalisation). In fact it was not at all unususal to be buried in one’s own normal attire. In Jesus’ case, his clothes had been taken from him prior to his execution, the soldiers throwing dice for his seamless tunic. He was utterly naked on the cross, which was the usual practice, not even the loin cloth of artistic convention. \nMy comment on extravagant funerals does not rest on Diana Fulbright’s paper, but on an Enclopaedia Britannica extract concerning Gamaliel II (2nd century AD). “When he died, he was buried, according to his own wish, garbed in simple linen, to discourage the expensive burials that had impoverished many Jewish families.” You may quarrel with Encyc Brit if you so wish. \nOther commentators above have covered the question of the general availability of a variety of cloths in Jerusalem either locally produced or through external Trade.

(There are also other postings) Max seems prepared to take at face value John 19:19 “They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths, FOLLOWING THE JEWISH BURIAL CUSTOM.” It seems to be Max’s assertion that everything required by the Law would have been carried out, even if this meant extending the burial time beyond sunset, which I understand he considered legitimate. (The burial activity did not need to cease on the appearance of the third star, if it was already in progress.) Very likely there were others present that could assist Joseph and Nicodemus. As the market / shops probably closed around midday, one explanation he has is that the cloth was originally intended for Joseph’s own burial (hence no shopping required). Another explanation (Hoeven) is that it was John Mark’s temple garment worn as a himation, which Joseph was able to recover on his visit to Pilate.

It provides some fascinating insights into the radical approach to leadership Pope Francis is applying from his Jesuit formation into his mission of transforming the Church. \nThere are not only the more obvious signs of selfish exploitation mentioned by John Klotz in Francis’ references to the pollution of rivers such as in the Philippines, but also the more subtle signs in weather change, such as the expected devastating typhoon in Okinawa.  We are particularly conscious of this in NZ and the Pacific, brought about by man-made global warming.  Despite its mid-latitude geography, the Antarctic upper atmospheric ozone hole now extends to NZ, and our mid-summers now impact on us resulting in one of the highest UV light exposures on the planet.  Ice-shelves and glaciers are melting with the consequence of rises in sea levels flooding low lying Pacific islands, already evident in Kiribati and elsewhere.  Weather systems are becoming more and more unstable resulting in frequently changeable extremes.  One of the principal causes is man-made atmospheric pollution brought about by our excessive use of fossil fuels.  Accidents are inevitable with deep sea oil drilling, and occasional foundering of monster oil tankers, such as those that occurred in the Caribbean with major damage to sea-life.  Man’s selfishness knows no limits and the earth suffers the consequence.  \nOur approach to stewardship has been ambivalent.  We may use what the earth has to offer, but primal societies often understood the responsibility of the duties of care and conservation rather better than his modern descendants.

His main message could have been stated in one sentence: “He considers that when the Shroud is being subject to some scientific test, then only the protocols of that science should apply, and other disciplines should not intrude – in a word religion should be placed in the back pocket.”  There is nothing controversial in that.  But then he goes on and on, and allows his own religious perspectives to intrude and this then gets him into trouble!  \nBut there can be no doubt that the Shroud itself must have a religious dimension to it.  There can be no escaping it!  Many consider it a likeness of the founder of their own religion, the ony true religion, the only true likeness that can be verified, and they revere and worship this founder.  And we do not know yet how this image was formed.  Science has so far failed to ascertain how.  Science has made unprecedented advances in the 115 years since Secundo Pio first took the first photographs.  But despite all these wonderful advances, Human Science has so far failed to ascertain the nature of the image, nor how it was formed.  It is almost laughable.  There are only untested theories, and a few ambiguous experiments.  It is human to draw various inferences  from this lack of progress and to speculate.  If Science has an answer – let it speak – but for the present it can only remain silent and speculate.    \nYannick denigrates the work of a dedicated scientist, Giovanna De Liso, who certainly did not allow religion to intrude into her work, and over a period of 12 years and some 400 experiments later produced some of the few 3D images that have resulted from any experiments.  Because they involved earthquakes, which he dismisses as so much gospel midrash, they do not suit his own perspectives on the matter.  It is not known if the images she produced were on the cellulose or on an impurity layer.  But she obtained the best results when the cloths were imbibed with a mixture of myrrh and aloes!  Does this ring any bells?  But they involved radiation from radon, so they do not fit into Yannick’s own narrow perspective and those of his one true scientific hero!   \nThere is a sign of the Resurrection on the Shroud!  It is the image itself, and the lack of a human body.  How that image was formed, we do not know!  It may have been naturalistic, or it may have been otherwise.

This is inconsistency at its worst! \nHe then accuses myself and Carlos of being in the “supernatural freaks club of Fanti”.  This probably refers to an inference he makes that Professor Fanti apparently expects that the Resurrection has left some material trace on the Shroud.  I do not know if that is Professor Fanti’s position or not; it may be.  But it is certainly not my position, and the accusation is completely unjustified.    \nIf Yannick cannot see that the image itself is a sign of the Resurrection, then his viewpoint is even more limited than I had imagined, and he misses the principal message left by this sacred burial cloth of Jesus Christ.  He chooses to ignore the remainder of my last paragraph: “How that image was formed, we do not know! It may have been naturalistic, or it may have been otherwise.”  This statement can hardly put me into any kind of “supernatural freaks club” but is a fair statement of the present position.  Yannick pretends he knows that it is naturalistic, but he cannot know that this is so!  \nWith his own persistent narrow perspective, his persistent misreading and possibly deliberate misinterpreting of my comments, his inconsistency in debating the issue, and his unjustifiable accusations against me, the matter has become too tiresome for me to continue this debate with him any further.

But it was a physical event for which we as yet only have a limited understanding.  It was also a supernatural event.  The Resurrection involved a body, and that is physical.  It was not merely a spiritual event.  But it was supernatural.  \nThe apostles saw and touched Jesus after the Resurrection;  Thomas was invited to put his hand into His side, and to touch Him.  Jesus was seen to eat and drink with the apostles at Emmaus.  That is something which a mere spirit is incapable of.  To talk of a “spiritual body” is a contradiction in terms, it cannot even be a metaphor;  it can only be a euphemism for something that we do not understand.  \nThe distinctions are very important theologically and philosophically, and just possibly also scientifically.  We do not as yet know how the image on the Shroud was formed, and there is general disagreement as to whether this was caused by a naturalistic process, or whether it may have been a miraculous event, either miraculous by a providential concomitance of the circumstances that produced it by a naturalistic process, or else by the direct intervention of the Deity.  All perspectives have their supporters, and I see little point in debating a preferred method without knowing and understanding a lot more about the image than we have at present.  Such a debate generates more heat than enlightment.  At some time in the future, when further access to the relic may be allowed, Science may be able to discover a more definitive answer than is possible at present.  In the meantime, I believe all options as to how this image of Jesus Christ was formed are open.  \nRegarding evidence of the Resurrection from the image: Clearly initiation and completion of the imaging process occurred within some 40 hours of death, as there is no sign of corruption,  Whether the actual image was apparent immediately, some hours afterwards, or some years afterwards is not known.  But the initiation process was complete within 40 hours.  What happened to the body?  If it had been unwrapped from its burial cloth and taken, this would have left some trace, such as smearing from fluids, blurring of the image, or damage to the fibrils of the linen.  But there is no such evidence.  We can only be left with the conclusion that this cloth is at least persuasive evidence of the Resurrection as a real event in our time and space and hence in physical reality.\n\n","date":"December 17, 2012 at 3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is-it-absurd-to-think-that-the-shroud-can-show-a-physical-trace-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","title":"Is it absurd to think that the Shroud can show a physical trace of the Resurrection?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Yannick, you are persistently misreading what I am saying!

It has to be agreed that it is problematic, and frequently not as specific as we would like it to be in the 21st century.  But then there are reasons for this:  The early Christians followed the OT prohibitions on images;  frequent persecutions created reasons for secrecy, so there are only veiled references to such secrets in obscure and analogic (coded) format.  The cult of icons developed in the 6th & 7th centuries and were followed by periods of iconoclasm: Icon worshippers were persecuted 726 – 786 and 814 – 842.  Icon veneration was only restored in 843.  The Byzantine practice of religion tended to protect the most sacred of relics from the common gaze.  Following the fall of Constantinople in 1204, when the Crusaders set about their pillage of relics, papal threats of excommunication of those found to be in possession of them would discourage disclosure. \nPossibly the best survey of such documentation at present available is that by Daniel Scavone:  “Acheiropoietos Jesus Images in Constantinople: the Documentary Evidence”  by Daniel C. Scavone:  : http://www.sindonology.org/scavone-acheiropoietos.pdf   \nScavone has also addressed the problem of the period 1204 – 1355:  “BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400”;  http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers.htm   This paper does not favour the Templar theory, although from Louis’ comments, there would seem to be more to come to light on this aspect.  \nOther writers have also attempted to address the whereabouts of the Shroud during the first 500 years of Christianity, such as Jack Markwardt.  The material they have to work with is often obscure for the reasons given above, but might be considered if not persuasive, then at least highly suggestive.  Given the circumstances of history, that is probably the best that can be done for the present, until such time as more enlightening information might come to light.  But it is not the desert implied by the comments: “(a) a lack of written record which extends over 13 centuries, and which some might consider stretches credulity somewhat where a1st century provenance is concerned, and (b) a lack of written record between (say) 1300 and 1357.”  Read Scavone and make of it what you will.\n\n","date":"July 28, 2014 at 6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"In 1464, the same year that Duke Louis of Savoy made a settlement of 50 gold francs with the Lirey clergy for the loss of the Shroud, theologian Francesco della Rovere, soon to become Pope Sixtus IV wrote a book in which he mentions, “… the Shroud in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was taken down from the cross.

The Wiki site I mentioned, does mention the antikythera as a real object and makes the point that it was a type of mechanical computer.  The hoax aspect comes from various fringe groups who interpret the discovery of such devices in weird and preposterous ways.  \nAfter mentioning Archimedes’ description of his orrery, a type of planetarium. Sprague de Camp devotes some two pages in describing the antikythera and its discovery in some detail, and yet my text was published way back in 1963.  More would be known about it now.   It was essentially an astronomical computer, enclosed in a wooden box about a foot high, the size of a table clock.  De Camp describes its working and gear trains in some detail.  Apparently the Egyptians did not have leap years in their calendar, and so there was provision for resetting the device when the months went out of synchronisation.  Some repairs made to the machine would indicate that it did indeed work.  It must have required some very complex gearing as it would be relying on the Ptolemaic model of astronomy, rather than the later simpler Copernican model.  The ship containing the device sank about 65 BCE.  \nDe Camp writes:  “Nothing more is heard about such devices for over a thousand years.  Yet they must have been built, for about 1000 CE, al-Bhirini, an Iranian savant who traveled in India, described a similar machine”, and he makes some comparisons with the antikythera.  \nRegarding the Besancon Shroud, which you also commented on:  Scavone suggests that the original Shroud was sent by Othon de la Roche to his home cathedral in Besancon.  He postulates that this was obtained by his descendant Jeanne de Vergy who rescued it as the church was in a bad state of repair, and was later destroyed by fire.  He suggests that she later replaced it with a copy, which gave rise to the confusion from the Pierre D’Arcy memorandum alleging fraud, and as no-one knew what the original looked like, the Besancon clergy accepted it, believing it to be the original.  I may have read that the Besancon shroud included a copy of the ventral image only.  Make of this what you will, you can check Scavone’s paper, “BESANÇON AND OTHER HYPOTHESES FOR THE MISSING YEARS: THE SHROUD FROM 1200 TO 1400” ;  http://ohioshroudconference.com/papers.htm\n.\n\n","date":"August 1, 2014 at 4:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Modern interest in the Shroud originates with the then startling photos of Secondo Pia in 1898.  In 1902 Yves Delage presented the forensic work of biologist Paul Vignon and associates to the Paris Academy.  The secular mood prevailing within the Academy at the time, created problems for Delage which are a matter of record, the Secretary of the Academy for instance refusing to publish the full text of the presentation.  \nBoth the photos of Pia and the work of Delage & Vignon presented a challenge to a certain  dangerous Modernist trend within the Catholic Church at the time as it seemed that the Shroud imagery corroborated the texts of the gospels to the extent that the texts could no longer be dismissed as mere mythology according to the Modernist agenda.  \nBy manipulating the Pierre D’Arcis texts, Ulysse Chevalier was able to create an impression that the Shroud was an artifact dating from medieval times, and this argument was picked up by Herbert Thurston.  The Catholic Encyclopedia article of 1907-14 was authored by Thurston, is solely based on Chevalier’s thesis and slanted history of the D’Arcis memorandum, with no consideration of what was then known of the image, such as its peculiar photo-negative properties and the work of Delage and Vignon.  His judgment that ‘the immense preponderance of opinion among learned Catholics was adverse to the authenticity of the relic’ is fundamentally his own opinion, with its sole basis being a questionable interpretation of history with no consideration of any scientific aspect. \nFollowing the publication of his ‘Shroud of Christ’ in 1902, Vignon carried out further research, travelling extensively, studying icons and identifying features common to the Shroud image, culminating in 1938 with publication of his “Holy Shroud of Turin: Science, Archaeology, History, Iconography, Logic” and was accordingly awarded the French Academy Prize, the Academy seemingly relenting on its 1902 response to Delage’s presentation. \nIn 1931, much improved photographs were provided by Guiseppe Enrie,  These were studied by forensic pathologist Pierre Barbet, who conducted several experiments on cadavers and amputated limbs, and who published works 1935-1950.  Further forensic studies were carried out by Dr David Willis in England.  The reaction of Pope Pius XII upon being informed of Barbet’s findings was the tearful response: “We did not know; nobody had ever told us!”  \nUntil 1969, King Umberto and the Turin guardians had resisted all attempts at scientific investigation and the taking of samples, notwithstanding that the Savoys had from time to time taken threads or other small samples for occasional gifts to family members or other notables.  All investigations up until then were solely based on the Pia and Enrie photographs.  The Pellegrino secret Commission of 1969-76 appears to have been the first time that the Shroud was ever subject to any kind of direct scientific scrutiny, but was limited in scope.  The Raes textile samples, and Frei’s pollen samples date from this time. \nThere had been some general awareness of the Shroud image among the Catholic faithful, as I recall seeing copies of the facial image among family homes during my childhood and youth during say 1948-60 and I recall reading magazine articles about it.  Fr Peter Rinaldi had published his article in the Passionist monthly magazine “The Sign” in 1934, and also creating some interest in Scientific American”.  The more recent film “The Silent Witness” also created considerable awareness.  \nBut perhaps it was only with the publication of Ian Wilson’s book in 1978, that propelled the Shroud to a greater awareness among the anglophone public.  Whatever the shortcomings in Wilson’s own research, the sheer scope and coverage of the many different aspects of the Shroud in his book, certainly acted as a major catalyst for public awareness.\n\n","date":"November 20, 2015 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/19/just-in-time-for-christmas-the-relic-master/","cat":"books","title":"Just in time for Christmas:  The Relic Master"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Sorry, the flying monk is St Joseph of Cupertino, patron saint of air travellers.

Prior to this, its dimensions were said to be 4.34m x 1.09m (Wilson).  The ratio length to width is almost exactly 4:1, suggesting a cubit of about 545 mm.  Multiply 1.09 by 4, the answer is 4.36m, i.e. 2 cm longer than 4.34m.  Now suppose a 2cm strip was taken from one of the ends, so that the original length was in fact 4.36 cm.  If Evaristo is correct,  and not less than 2 cm was removed along the length of the cloth during the time that the edge piece was removed, then the original width of the Shroud could not have been more than 1.09m, but which is in fact its current width.  That is if there is any significance in the highly suggestive 4:1 ratio.  The original width ought not to have been less than 1.11m, and applying the 4:1 ratio, the original length ought to have been 4.44m, that is, 10 cm longer than it is now.  \n2) Methchild Flury-Lemburg is on record as saying that she had only ever seen the same stitching of the side-seam in cloths at Masada.  [I’m aware of course that Charles Freeman does not accept this, and his lady-wife considers it a more common stitch]  Mme F-L offered the explanation that the Shroud came from a much wider bolt of cloth, and that the selvedge on the original remnant bolt was removed and resewn to provide the Shroud side-strip.  We are now being asked to accept the explanation that the edge was resewn under Savoy, by either Valfre or another, and who used a stitching identical to that which Mme F-L says was exclusively used at Masada. \nNotwithstanding any of this, Evaristo’s claims would seem sufficient to be able to assert that it is very likely that at various times, pieces were in fact removed and then skilfully resewn as to leave little trace of their removal.  The bottom line is that it reinforces the need for properly representative sampling, which was certainly not done in the case of the 1988 C-14 invasion.\n\n","date":"May 22, 2014 at 4:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Thank you Charles, a most interesting and fascinating observation.

Most of the expositions were outdoors.  I believe the most significant  tensions would be created by windage (aerodynamics).  These forces would be of two kinds: 1)  billowing normal to the cloth (equivalent to aerodynamic “lift”) 2) drag forces tangential to the cloth.  It seems likely that individual expositions may have lasted several hours.  In addition the cloth would have been subjected at each exposition to: removal from reliquary,  unwrapping / unfolding / unrolling,  transport to exposition site,  return transport to chapel, refolding / rerolling,  placement in reliquary.  There would be localised handling at suspension points with concentration of stress forces, and some abrasion which would be cumulative.  Also occasional accidents were always bound to happen.  Hygiene practices being what they were, bacterial contamination would add to localised degradation.  Likely there have been hundreds of such expositions, and that’s only the ones since 1355.  Other damage may have occurred prior to 1204.  The need for occasional repairs is, I think, self-evident.  It eventually led to the disastrous restoration of 2002.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2014 at 5:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Sails are held securely in place by adjustable lanyards so that they only flap incidentally a little bit during a tacking change in course.

Even mild to moderate winds results in flapping of the cloths, technically known as “flutter”.  It is caused by shedding of oscillating vortex trails at the trailing edge.  Cloth is particularly prone because of its lightness and flexibility, and because it lacks any rigidity.  The effect is to cause periodic varying tension stresses throughout the material, concentrated at the suspension points, and eroding the residual fatigue life of the fibres.  Linen being brittle would be more prone to fatigue damage than cotton or linen / cotton admixtures.  Thus if bed-sheets were changed weekly, and laundered say once a fortnight, 100 expositions might correspond to four years of regular laundry suspensions.  Check the corners of your bed-sheets if they’re hung out and pegged on the clothes-line.  Linen ones would be more susceptible than cotton.  I dare say that central France and Piedmont may have more gentle zephyrs than our notorious Wellington winds, but I would suspect that windage is likely to be the reason and cause of any significant damage, together with bacterial contamination.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2014 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/22/more-tomfoolery-the-carbon-dating-results-are-worthless/","cat":"books","title":"More Tomfoolery: The carbon dating results are worthless"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Anon is starting to become boring.

It is interesting that the stone head has a landscape framework similar to some mandylion representations, and it may be that there is a barely discernible epsilon on the forehead. The statue would seem to post-date 1204 when it may be assumed that the full image of the Shroud would then be known. If the epsilon is indeed present, it would seem that for some reason the sculptor has associated the Shroud face with the Mandylion image.  I know of no other mandylion with the epsilon sign. I think it may be presumptuous to attempt to read what may have been in the sculptor’s mind by this association. By no means can it be asserted as proof that they were one and the same object, but it may be thought highly suggestive. \nThe involvement of the templars as custodians of the Shroud post-1204 is contentious.  Daniel Scavone downplays the likelihood.  He notes that only relatively junior templars confessed to worshipping a head, and then only under torture, and they would not have been privy to the innermost secrets of the order. Scavone claims that the same accusation was levelled against the Cathars, and it was only at the suggestion of the inquisitors that the confessions of worshipping a head were obtained. \nAs the templars were in Constantinople during the fourth crusade, many of them would have heard the legends of the mandylion, a few may have seen it, and Robert de Clari claimed to have seen the Shroud image exhibited at Blachernae.  So they knew of both, but that does not necessarily imply that they ever had custody of either. But it’s sufficient to explain the Calvary as a templar construction. There is also the well-known templar mandylion representation at Templecombe. The Master of Normandy burnt at the stake with Jaques de Molay in 1314 was an earlier namesake of Geoffrey de Charnay.

According to the tradition based on a historic account written by Father Donato from Bomba in 1640, it arrived in Manoppello on an unknown day in the year 1506, when the physicist and astrologer Giacomo Antonio Leonelli, while was talking with some people, met a foreign man. He was invited to follow him into the Church. He received a mysterious wrapped veil. … While Father Donato was unrolling the veil, thus discovering the image of Christ, the foreign man disappeared.”\n“The veil stayed at the Leonelli family for almost one hundred years; but in 1608 the several heirs started to contend for it. … (etc)”\n“Father Heinrich Pfeiffer, Jesuit and Professor of Iconology and History of Christian Art at the Gregorian University of Rome, thinks the veil of Manoppello is the Roman Veronica. According to the historic reconstruction, Veronica, called “acheiropoietos”, reached Constantinople in VI century (coming from Jerusalem and then from Camelia, in Cappadocia). It stayed there until 705, when it disappeared mysteriously, perhaps to save it from the iconoclastic movements of the time. It was in Rome under Pope Gregorio; after several vicissitudes, it was carried into St Peter’s Cathedral, becoming an important destination for thousands pilgrims. After the demolition of the chapel where Veronica was held, in 1608, no trace of the veil was found. The veil appeared in Manoppello is thought to be the historic and legendary Veronica.”\n“In 1978 Sister Blandina Paschalis Schloemer, a clever iconographer, said on account of some researches and investigations that the sacred face in Manoppello and the sacred face of the Sacra Sindone (the Holy Shroud) in Turin are exactly superimposable.

He sees the origin of the Abgar legend as the archival record of the conversion set in allegorical terms to the predecessor Abgar V because of the anti-christian policies of the new emperor Severus, and the already precarious position of Abgar VIII in the imperial court because of his previous pro-Parthian policy.

His is only one scholarly voice, but the programme Meier set himself was long overdue and necessary. There are others who will attempt the task that Louis espouses. Nor do I agree that Meier’s work will be the cause of Christians falling away from their faith, quite the reverse. \nThe modern quest for the historical Jesus had its beginnings with the publication of the work of Schweitzer (1906-10) and Bultmann (1934). There followed an outpouring of other works by various scholars, which was given added impetus by the development of multi-disciplinary methods of modern criticism applied to ancient literature, and in particular to biblical literature.  \nWhile many attempts had scholarly value, the efforts of some authors were highly speculative sometimes even degenerating almost to the form of a novel, while yet others verged to the opposite extreme of reductionism and scepticism and a general rejection of the Jesus of traditional Faith, almost on principle.  Towards the end of the 20th century, the promoters of the “Jesus Seminar” for instance, adopted a kind of committee approach to validating the various sayings, yielding a reductionist approach biased towards general scepticism.   \nThe various Christian churches reacted to this “historical quest” in various ways; ranging from the fundamentalist literal approach of interpreting the scriptures and rejection of such novelties, to others with a more readily liberal acceptance of some of the assertions made.  \nMeier’s conclave, or imaginary round table, of a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew and an agnostic – all honest historians cognizant of first-century religious movements – brought a much-needed discipline into this quest for the “Historical Jesus”, that other such attempts had failed to do. Those scholars who follow Meier now have a sound basis on which they may build. \nThat many in the Western World are falling away, can be attributed to a variety of causes: the unduly loud voice of secularism, and indifferentism, the cult of the individual, a post-modernist philosophy, and a selfish hedonism, to name a few of the army of Legion.  It cannot be attributed to the scholarly work of such as John P Meier. \nElsewhere, others are heeding the call of the gospel.

He is William K. Warren Professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame. His fields include biblical studies and Christianity and Judaism in antiquity. Before coming to Notre Dame, he was professor of New Testament at The Catholic University of America. \nMeier makes careful distinctions between the “The Real Jesus”, the “Biblical Jesus” and the “Historical Jesus”, and we might also add the “Jesus of Faith”. It is to the “Historical Jesus” that Meier turns his attention in “A Marginal Jew”.  \nCertainly there are limits to what the historical method can achieve, and in order to discover the “Jesus of Faith” we must look elsewhere, such as to Benedict’s “Jesus of Nazareth”.  However in a rational age, this “Jesus of Faith” must surely need to correspond to the “historical Jesus” rather than some idealised pietistic fantasy.

But Meier’s approach seeks to be essentially historic and he is only interested in such speculations only to dismiss them as not being based on any factual evidence, and providing no real information for a proper historical approach.   \nI personally find it intriguing that it was at Sepphoris, as you say only 5km from Nazareth, that the True Cross (Vera Crux) eventually disappeared when the Crusaders were defeated by Saladin who captured it as a war trophy during the battle of Hattin.  I liked the romantic idea that it was as if the wooden cross had returned to the home town of Jesus, where he himself had worked in wood, and had included it in a romantic little essay I published in my parish magazine.  \nSepphoris had been rebuilt by Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee until he was banished in 39 AD.  \nEncyclopedia Britannica mentions several works on Sepphoris, but I doubt that they would shed any light on Jesus’ activities there.  They include: A.H.M. Jones, The Greek City from Alexander to Justinian (1940, reissued 1979), is a good introduction to ancient cities like Tiberias and Sepphoris.

The driving forces for that extinction primarily involve the selfish exploitation of the environment.  Our air, water, and land are all yielding to onslaughts from interests seeking immense wealth, whatever the environmental costs.”\nCuriously I had just read a short article from our Archdiocesan newspaper that I picked up last evening at church; Wel-Com, April 2014, “In search of the Ark” by Kieran Fenn, which addresses this issue. It is just a little too soon for the article yet to appear on the Wel-Com web-site. Fenn draws on Valdes, A.A. ‘The Bible Questions People Ask’. I was aware of the Babylonian origins of the Noah story and so the article attracted my attention. \nSome extracts:\n“The author took a pre-existing story, with all its interestng details, to transmit a religious teaching. The first lesson was that the flood came because of human frailty, a lesson for our own endangered planet..”\n“Sin accumulated to the point of corruption and perversion that provoked a catastrophe. With all this, the world came back to to the chaos that existed before creation. The order that God has put into creation could be destroyed by human responsibility.\n… No reason is given Noah; he is told to do it and wait. Ridicule from his contemporaries would follow, and Noah’s only answer could be ‘God ordered me to do so. I obey.’ No complaint comes from his lips over four chapters; no other biblical character is told so little and saying so little. Finally God reveals the secret of the rain.\nThe message is clear according to the ways of the Old Testament. If humanity obeys God’s orders, it will be saved. If it disobeys, it faces self-destruction. God specifies the measurements, materials and form of the ark. We have to shape our lives according to God’s dimensions and then we will transcend any storm. Those who do not listen to God’s guidance will drown.” \nReserves are one way of assisting the survival of threatened species, and NZ conservationists have been active in ensuring the survival of many species of our vulnerable indigenous bird, insect, reptile and plant life by moving colonies to predator-free near-by islands, and taking action against exotic introduced predators.  We have recently scored a major success in the UN against whaling in our Southern Ocean. \nHowever there is a much wider issue, that of the survival of the planet. The depredation of large forests which in the past have ensured atmospheric stability, aggravated by our ever-increasing use of fossil fuels, the consequential global warning, melting of the ice caps with rising sea levels, and the drowning of low-lying islands and present coastal areas which will no longer be inhabitable. Most of us are already experiencing the effects of climate change, its effects on changing food production patterns, more frequent climate disasters, and major fatalities in local populations. \nAdam was given steward-ship of the earth. Too often he has seen this as a license to exploit rather than conserve.  There are still lessons to be learnt in the story of Noah.  There is one threatened species I shall not miss from our planet, that of the ever-depleting global-warming deniers!\n\n","date":"April 5, 2014 at 4:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/05/the-extinction-of-humanity/","cat":"books","title":"The Extinction of Humanity?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Andy, I can assure you that the first several chapters of John’s book is good solid factual history of the scientific studies of the Shroud, particularly the development and work of the STURP team.

In particular the Type I weapon they illustrate cannot be the weapon used to produce the Type I flagellation marks.  It shows four thongs with three pellets each thong located near the tips.  Barbet states that the majority wounds occur as dumbbells in pairs, implying two pellets for each of two thongs.  Most of the flagellation marks on the front of the body are produced by the tips of the thongs whipping around to the front, implying that the pellets were at some distance from the tips.  \nThe Faccini-Fanti Type II wounds they say are not clearly visible to the naked eye and have been elucidated by image enhancement, a method unavailable to any medieval copyists.  They seem to envisage that the Type II wounds were produced by a type of lictor fasces.  Very likely they were inflicted during the journey to the crucifixion site.  \nA close-up inspection of the Mario Latendresse Shroudscope images, either Enrie negative or Durante positive, shows that the vast majority of the flagellation marks are on the dorsal image, with only a few visible on the ventral image.

Crucial to his case is the actual date of composition. There had been an exposition of the Shroud at Turin in 1868, so that it may have come to Elgar’s attention fairly early in his life (1857-1934). Secondo Pia’s attempts at photography occurred during the eight day exposition commencing on May 25, 1898, and he succeeded on May 28, the Shroud being returned to the Royal Chapel on June 2. The Wiki entry states that Elgar composed the work during 1898-99, although another source I referred to gave 1896, which would seem to be too early if Pia’s photos were the inspiration. Possibly the 1896 date may be unreliable judging from the Wiki commentary, which has the entry:\n“Elgar’s account of the piece’s genesis was that after a tiring day of teaching in late October 1898, he was daydreaming at the piano. A melody he played caught the attention of his wife Alice, (etc)”. \nOther possible intriguing solution are given in the Wiki account, including various popular tunes which Elgar stated were incorrect, and also other explanations including an approximation to the math constant pi, from the intervals 3 1 4 2, although apparently this is a fairly common sequence in composition.   \nThe Roman liturgy for the Easter Saturday vigil Paschal Candle ceremony requires the celebrant to cut on its surface a cross with the figures of the current year, each figure being placed in one of the cross quadrants, and to inscribe the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet above and below, and saying “Christ yesterday and today the beginning and the end Alpha and Omega all time belongs to him (etc)”. He then inserts the five grains of incense into the form of the cross as symbols of the five wounds. I am unable to comment on the Greek practices, whether an L shape or cross was incised.\nThe allusion to the swastika as a combination of four gamma symbols is interesting, but I think only illustrates that symbols can be a rich and imaginative source of inspiration. The swastika itself is a very ancient symbol and would pre-date Masada. It’s form is usually reversed from its more familar Nazi form. It can be found in ancient India and also China. My Chinese daughter-in-law from North China frequently decorated eggs with rows of such symbols as signs of ‘good luck’.\nElgar composed several religious works, including a number of Oratorios both before and after the Enigma Variations. Was the Shroud the inspiration for the Enigma? Who knows? Like many artistic creations, it may have had manifold inspirational influences, some no doubt subconscious, although Elgar seems to have made it clear that there was one particular enigma behind it.

It seems to have had an Indo-Aryan origin but other cultures also imported it. Earliest examples associate it with the sun, whence sun-god, whence any supreme god according to the culture. It was Indian Buddhism that introduced the symbol to China. The central position sometimes included a disc or wheel indicating the sun, and the arms supposedly the rays pointing in all directions. There were variations, sometimes only with three spokes somewhat similar to the Manx three-legged symbol. \nA problem I have in interpreting the Shroud “poker holes” as a gamma symbol is that the shape of the hole pattern depicted above is an inverted gamma pointing in the opposite direction. It is more like an L or even 7. Depending on which one of the four patterns is observed, two show an L and two show a gamma, because of the folding when the holes occurred. If the ‘L’ is intended as an abbreviation for “Lumen” then this is Latin, not Greek of course, whereas the holes seem to have occurred during a Greek-speaking period rather than during Roman Latin. \nIf, however the pattern is intended to be a Gamma, then I wonder if it can be associated with the Trinity. The Greeks picked up the Hebrew habit of gematria (Gk “esopsephia”) during New Testament times (e.g. Rev use of the numer 666 for antichrist). The Greek numerary system at this time used 30 alphabetic symbols for numerals, divided up into three groups of ten, for units, tens, hundreds. The symbol gamma denotes the numeral 3! Is this an instance of “disciplina arcani”, a secret way of saying that this object belongs to the Tri-une God? Or if it is intended to be a gamma on the Shroud, then “This is God’s cloth”? \nOf course it all depends on whether the pattern is deliberate or a providential accident with incense during worship!\n\n","date":"June 11, 2013 at 10:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/11/the-poker-holes-on-the-turin-shroud-deliberately-put-there-to-designate-the-cloth-as-sacred/","cat":"books","title":"The poker holes on the Turin Shroud deliberately put there to designate the cloth as sacred?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Matthias: I know of three papers by Pam Moon, I think Dan listed two of them in a posting a few days ago.

Constantine VII of course closely inspected the Mandylion on its first arrival in Constantinople, commenting on the “watery” appearance of the image, while his step-brothers were unable to discern it very well at all. \nIn addition we have the references quoted by Albert Dreisbach in his paper “Lazarus & Jesus” at the Atlanta conference in 2005:\n“… we should not be overly surprised to discover as early as A.D. 325, Pope Sylvester I established: that Mass be celebrated on an altar covered with a cloth of linen consecrated by the Bishop, as if it were the clean Shroud of Christ. ”\n“Theodore of Mopsuestia (ca. A.D. 350-428) expresses this motif’s incorporation into the liturgy, describing the role of the deacons in the liturgy as follows: ”\n“When they bring up (the oblation at the offertory) they place it on the altar for the completed representation of the passion so that we may think of Him on the altar as if He were placed in the sepulchre after having received the passion … the deacons who spread\nthe linens on the altar represent the figure of the linen cloths at the burial….”\nThese allusions, although they do not specifically refer to a cloth with an image, clearly demonstrate that the burial cloths were considered particlarly significant in the liturgy, they were clearly in the minds of the liturgists, and it is rational to infer that there must have been some specific known object giving rise to this outlook, for an emphasis to be made on “burial cloths” in the liturgy.\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 6:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/11/the-poker-holes-on-the-turin-shroud-deliberately-put-there-to-designate-the-cloth-as-sacred/","cat":"books","title":"The poker holes on the Turin Shroud deliberately put there to designate the cloth as sacred?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"“… hopefully I will continue to see Christ more in others and not just his image on the shroud.”\nSeeing Christ in the image on the Shroud is the easy part;  I’ve ussually found that seeing Christ in others can somtimes be very difficult indeed.

Effectively that nothing in the weaving or sewing techniques speaks against a high-quality product of textile workers of the first century AD. It might equally be said that it is within the capability of 20th century textile workers, although the process of extracting the linen from the flax is clearly quite different. The important point she makes however is that the cloth cannot be rejected as not being of 1st century provenance simply on the grounds of the weaving or sewing techniques used. \nHowever, elsewhere she rejects it as being of medieval provenance because of the width of the cloth. She refers for example to bed-sheets which commonly had a seam running down their middle, as medieval looms lacked the width of ancient types. \nI think it a serious error of logic in focusing on only one property at a time and then making a judgment simply on that. It may not suit the scientific mind-set, but it is how evidence works in our law-courts. The TOTAL evidence must be weighed to arrive at a successful conclusion. I prefer to think in terms of Venn diagrams. Thus evidence might satisfy Propositions A, B, C and D but not satisfy Propositions E and F. It may be that E and F are so critical as to negate the conclusion, or it may be that they are can be considered as not so relevant. However if all propositions A through to F are in fact satisfied then there is clearly a strong case.\nIn the case of the TS, there are several points of evidence that point to its authenticity. Some of these are very strong, others less so. The question of weaving and sewing tends perhaps to be the type of evidence that allows the admissibility of authenticity without it being necessarily corroborative. The forensic evidence is particularly strong and tends to be coroborative. The question of halophyte pollens demonstrates that the TS was certainly at some time in Palestine, other pollens that it was there during the months of March or April. The arogonite limestone is persuasive but needs further independent confirmation. \nIt is important not to lose sight of the whole picture. Experts may carp and niggle over particular aspects exclusive to their particular specialty. But experts never get to sit on juries, their role is advisory only. The judge’s direction is always couched in terms of what the evidence leads a reasonable person to conclude.\n\n","date":"November 29, 2013 at 4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/28/unraveling-unusual-stitches-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"books","title":"Unraveling Unusual Stitches in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I am unable to comment on whether Mrs Charles Freeman can speak as authoritatively on ancient textiles as I understand that Mme Methchild Flury-Lemburg is able to.

Key points made seem to be: a new tomb close to crucifixion site and in a garden;  Nicodemus bringing 100 pounds of myrrh and aloes;  took the body of Jesus, wrapped it with the spices in linen cloths; following the Jewish burial custom; it was Day of Preparation; tomb close at hand they laid Jesus there.  What one makes of all that still leaves much room for ambiguity. \nFrom “following Jewish burial custom” and “tomb close by” I think Max would argue that most of the burial rite would be carried out, including tight wrapping and other certain rituals, and that there was ample time to do this.  Others would argue the opposite, that the point seems to be made that it was Preparation Day which that year would fall on the sabbath, so it was especially sacred, and maybe the author is hinting that there wasn’t time for the full rites, and that allows the cloth to be loosely draped. \nI recently came across a paper (maybe on this site), I forget the details, but it was suggested that the body was tightly wrapped and was lain horizontal, but that the image was formed with the body vertical (e.g. round (not flat) buttocks) and the cloth at that stage was loosely draped.

My response to that question would have to be:  “Quite possibly.  But that there are some big ‘howevers’ “.  \nHugh has mentioned Fanti’s general approach, essentially measuring age-related changes in the spectral and mechanical properties of linen.  You can find his related papers or references to them on Barrie Schwortz’s shroud.com web-site.  Two in particular are: “Non-destructive dating of ancient flax textiles by means of vibrational spectroscopy” Authors: Giulio Fanti, Pietro Baraldi, Roberto Basso, Anna Tinti;  and “A NEW CYCLIC-LOADS MACHINE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF MICRO-MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF SINGLE FLAX FIBERS COMING FROM THE TURIN SHROUD” Authors: Giulio Fanti, Pierandrea Malfi.  \nI will confine my technical comments to the mechanical testing, the Cyclic-Loads machine.  Cyclic load testing has been used for several decades to measure the fatigue characteristics of engineering materials, particularly metallic materials such as steels and aluminium, and has a reputable history in engineering.  It is particularly suitable for testing materials which are susceptible to very many cycles of heavy loading over the life of the different components, such as engine parts and highly stressed components in railway bridging where heavy loadings are repetitive.  Typically all materials will fracture after a certain number of cycles for any given stress, down to a certain stress called the “endurance limit” below which no number of repetitions will produce fracture.  \nAnother mechanical characteristic of materials is the “Young’s modulus”.  This is the stress required to produce unit strain,  All materials will stretch when subject to a tensile load.  The strain is defined as the amount of extension divided by the length of the sample; the stress is the load divided by the cross-sectional area.  Young’s modulus is calculated by dividing the stress by the strain.  Several materials show elastic behaviour so that up to a certain elastic limit, strain is directly proportional to stress and Young’s modulus is fairly constant over this range.  Many materials however, such as aluminium are not elastic, and their stretch behavior increases with loading, so that for these more plastic materials the modulus is defined by adopting an appropriate engineering convention for them over the range of loading.   \nThe mechanical properties chosen by the authors as seemingly age-related were: breaking stress; two Young’s Moduli 1) relating to the last part of the increasing loading cycles, 2) relative to the first part of the decreasing loading cycles;  two loss factors relating to dissipated and stored energies and other factors.  \nMechanical properties of the flax fibres versus known ages of the samples were then correlated.  The authors write: “This goal was reached performing stress-strain measurements in 350 loading-unloading cycles of 85 different flax fibers belonging to samples of 12 different historical and modern flax fabrics, see Ref. [14], dating back to up to more than five thousand years ago, obtaining approximately 16,000 manual acquisitions.” \nThe authors thus obtained five correlation curves for their five parameters.  A measure of the “goodness of fit” when carrying out such work is the “Pearson’s correlation coefficient” = R.  If R = 0.0, then there is no obvious correlation between the parameter and age and consequently no obvious relationship;  If R = 1.0 then there is perfect fit and the parameter gives a very high predictability of true age.  For the five parameters, the authors claim values of R between 0.90 and 0.95, which on the face of it would seem to be quite high correlation ratios.     \nRather than taking a simple average of the five dating methods, the authors then proposed a “weighted mean” of the five methods giving greater weight to some apparently more reliable parameters than others.  They claim: “The resulting uncertainty of the historical dates deriving from the measured mechanical parameters has a standard uncertainty of about 200 years.” \nTaken singly, the five individual parameters give a very large range of possible dates for the TS, and with quite large margins of error.  The oldest date is 556 BC, error 336 years; youngest date 456 AD error 538 years.  However their weighted mean is 372 BC error 214 years.  I might be happier with this last result, if the authors had given a correlation coefficient for their choice of the weighted mean formula.  \nThere are many extraneous factors that can affect the mechanical properties of flax fibres.  The authors note the possible historic effects of humidity and heat.  They claim that these effects are manifest in the appearance of the fibres, such as their colour.  Various fibres were rejected for testing on these grounds.  Other effects, not evidently considered, result from the history of the parent fabric, such as repetitions of folding, rolling and methods of storage and their particular environment.  \nGian Marco Rinaldi above has referred to the subjective selection of apparently older fibres, which may raise a doubt as to the integrity of the selection process. \nI do not agree with Hugh’s conclusion that the results show such poor correlation that the method cannot be considered as useful.  However we need to know a lot more about the raw data, than has been forthcoming to date.  There is certainly the problem of obtaining sufficient calibration samples.  Acceptance of any new scientific method always requires its replication and peer review by other independent investigators, and of course so far, this has not happened. \nIn principle however, the method of mechanical testing might provide a type of credibility check on other more established dating methods, but because of the importance of extraneous effects mentioned, and these will always be unknown, it seems likely that quite large errors of at least 200 years or more, can never be eliminated.\n\n","date":"June 28, 2015 at 5:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/28/update-on-new-book-by-giulio-fanti-and-pierandrea-malfi/","cat":"books","title":"Update on New Book by Giulio Fanti and Pierandrea Malfi"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"The besetting tragic flaw of even successful novelists is an inability to distinguish fantasy and reality!\n\n","date":"May 17, 2012 at 2:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/16/two-reputable-researchers-professional-skeptic-joe-nickell-and-forensic-anthropologist-emily-craig-really/","cat":"books","title":"“Two reputable researchers, professional skeptic Joe Nickell and forensic anthropologist Emily Craig” Really?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"LMAO? “Like My Auntie Olga??”  So Jefferson writes an absoutely preposterous novel, and writes up his own critique, and then expects to be taken seriously when he pontificates on his shallow assessment of the Shroud?  “… easily created image??”  I don’t think so.

Strictly the term can only apply to a single coin placed in the mouth. \nFew expressions of religions have not been affected by cross-culturation, and it is evident throughout the various expressions of Christianity today.  Iranian religion for instance had a profound influence on Judaism, associated sects particularly the Essenes, and also on Christianity.  This is no new discovery.  Many fundamental religious beliefs and concepts had their primitive origins in Iran. \nThe presence of coins in Sadducee graves does not ipso facto demonstrate that this is evidence of their being unduly influenced by Greek pagan practices.\n\n","date":"June 21, 2015 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

Strictly, Charon’s obol is a single coin placed in the mouth, and coins that are sometimes found in the mouths of skulls, have sometimes dropped there from the eye sockets.  The ancient practice extended from Ireland, to Britain and most of Europe, and further east.  There were actually more Roman graves with coins in the skulls (about 50%) than ever occurred in Greece.  Greek playwrights were fond of lampooning the practice, because of its association with paying the ferryman.  (What would happen to the deceased, if they did not pay the ferryman?)  On another web-site, a Magyar grandmother explained the practice of placing coins over the eyes, so that visitors might not see their own death reflected in the person’s eyes.  Clearly there are a variety of cultural reasons for the practice.  The eyes are the windows of the soul, and visitors should not intrude thus far into the deceased’s privacy.

How representative is such a group from such a narrow age range; what university faculties were represented or were they all psychology students; would a preponderance of female observers result in a greater tendency to see pareidolia; is there a localised religious bias, i.e. were they Southern baptists, or from Yale or Harvard; etc.?  There might also be a scaling factor, an A4 photograph is much smaller than a 4m x 1m linen cloth.  From the report it would seem that the average observer in the religious context might see perhaps two religious words, more or less.  If many more words were reported by several observers, would that mean that the words are in fact very likely present, rather than not, and would a larger artifact need to be adjusted for scale?     \nIn any real experiment, the objective must needs be limited.

I have carried out several Monte Carlo simulations during my working career and also since then during personal research projects, so I’m well acquainted with what they can and cannot do.   Typically each possible outcome depends on a number of events all with different probabilities and frequency distributions.  A random number generator then determines whether a particular event occurs or not according to each event’s probability, and the outcome for a particular simulation obtained.  Several simulations, perhaps 1,000, are then run, and the overall probability distribution for the outcome obtained.  Several different approaches may be possible.  I have some difficulty in envisaging how a Monte Carlo simulation might be applied in deciding whether a perceived object is real or not.  Can you elucidate what you envisage?  \nTurning now to the authors’ paper and the overall problem:-\n1.  From the paper, it would seem that if several investigators asserted that they could see very much more than 2 inscriptions (say mean plus two SDs)  then that ought to be evidence that the inscriptions are in fact real, but if less than this they may only be pareidolia.  If the investigators all claimed independently to see the same inscription in the same place, that would be good evidence that the inscription was real.

In university sponsored psychology experiments it is common to use psychology students as the observers as being part of their practical training.  This creates a selective bias.  The students become trained guinea pigs, and after some experience may well guess the real purpose of the experiment, and so develop a skill in detecting the expectation of the experimenters, and seeking to please their professors, give a result that meets that expectation.

Frei was founder and director for 25 years of the scientific department of the Zurich Criminal Police.  Presumably his services were extensively and frequently used to secure criminal convictions in all of that time. His services had also been used for criminal work in Turin, when he was asked to notarise the 1973 shroud photography. His basic training was in botany. May we not assume that the techniques he used in retrieving and identifying pollens from the Shroud would not be too different from his practice in his criminal cases. \nScientific standards and protocols may be refined, improved and made more rigorous in the course of time.  Would not Frei be following the protocols he had developed during the course of his criminal work and accepted as good practice at the time. Does the criticism arise from measuring the standard of his work against a more recent and different standard? \nIn his 2010 book, Wilson tabulates a full-page detailed catalogue of 58 pollens identified by Frei, adapted from a posthumous work on Frei’s behalf by Professor Heinrich Pfeiffer. Further charts were publised by Dr Werner Bulst. Professors Danin & Baruch identified 91 species of thornbush exclusive to the Middle East. Dr Thomas Litt criticised the Danin/Baruch work as it appears that Baruch had not removed the pollens from the tapes to ensure accuracy of identification as apparently Frei had done. It was only at that stage that Danin disowned Baruch’s work. \nI now find it perplexing that Frei’s own work should be brought under a cloud.  What is the nature and source of the criticism, and how robust is this criticism? \nIt is vital that this matter be resolved. Otherwise Frei’s pollen samples are persuasive evidence that the Shroud during its history has at various times been in Southern Israel, in Jerusalem during March-April (Passover), and in Anatolia, as well as Western Europe.

I seem to have been blocked from posting on that thread, else told it’s a duplicate comment.  I’ll try posting it out of context here instead.  Here goes: \nConcerning the D’Arcy memorandum alleging that the image was painted: \nThe position is clearly set out in Markwardt’s 2001 paper “Conspiracy against the Shroud”, and Wilson 1978 also comments on it.  \nIn 1900 Ulysse Chevalier apparently had available to him a near-finished Latin draft from the Troyes diocesan archives addressed to a Scribe, which would imply that the alleged memorandum was never even sent to the Scribe, let only to Anti-pope Clement VII.  However rather than producing this draft, Chevalier cobbled together a text from prior separate notes, which included editing marks such as marginal notes, cross-outs, and substitute wording, and manufactured for it an end of 1389 date; as by its archival retention it would be clear from the near-finished draft for the scribe that the memorandum had not in fact been sent to Clement.  \nMarkwardt refers to the two source documents: “In 1993, Hilda Leynen discovered that two distinct drafts of the D’Arcis Memorandum were maintained in the Champagne collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, one very rough and containing bracketed words, and the other a relatively neat and polished product.”   \nFrom Chevalier’s cobbled Latin text, Herbert Thurston published an English translation in the Catholic periodical “The Month” in 1903.  Wilson 1978 provides the full text of Thurston’s translation as Appendix B, the fraud apparently even escaping Wilson’s attention.   \nThe relevant text cited by Markwardt is included in his Note 6:\n‘6  The memorandum refers to an alleged investigation conducted, in about 1355, by Henri\nde Poitiers, Bishop of Troyes. “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he\ndiscovered the fraud and how the cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being\nattested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not\nmiraculously wrought or bestowed.” ‘ \nWilson makes the point that Latin lacks a definite article, and that the verb used was not “pingere” (to paint) but “depingere” (to copy).  Thus the key phrase can be just as easily translated as: “… by an artist who had copied it … ”  which sheds rather a different light on the whole bizarre episode.  Thus relying on a questionable translation of a fraudulent memorandum may be the stuff by which art historians might make a living, but to others it may seem rather slender grounds for asserting that the origin of the Shroud image was ever an artist’s paint-brush! \nVery likely, D’Arcis’ alleged copy assuming it existed, may have been commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original she had taken from St Stephen’s at Besancon for safe-keeping and the venerable cleric was confused about the matter.  The 1880 assertion that both the Besancon and Piedmont Shrouds were authentic burial cloths beggars belief, would seem to be based on no more than an excessive piety, by 1880 the French Revolution would already have deposed of the Besancon icon, the reverend gentleman would no longer have had access to it, nor would he have had access to the 1898 Pia photography.\n\n","date":"November 26, 2014 at 4:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/25/environmental-study-of-the-shroud-in-jerusalem-videos/","cat":"video","title":"Environmental Study of the Shroud in Jerusalem Videos"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"If the cloth was on its way for sale in Jerusalem, then you’d be concerned about conserving its sale value and you wouldn’t be folding it into 52 squares with 1 foot sides.

Margaret de Charnay used a donkey to transport it across the hills to the Savoy castle, and held her precious relic in such high regard, that she’d be careful about such matters as folding.  They wouldn’t be storing it that way in the imperial collection at Constantinople either.  The solution that cries out as the most likely explanation, is that it was stored that way, perhaps hurriedly, to conceal and hide it from those who would pillage it, somewhere in the Middle East, perhaps by a custodian monk in Antioch, or even perhaps by a few of the apostles in a time of persecution.

It had been folded twice lengthwise and then with 12 loose folds concertina fashion.  The pattern is discussed in Wilson 2010, his Chapter 6 and Fig 12.

These explanations have not been accepted by John P Meier in his “A Marginal Jew”. . \nMonsignor Meier’s credentials are excellent – a Catholic priest in good standing with his Church – professor of New Testament at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., who has been both president of the Catholic Biblical Association and the general editor of the Catholic Biblical Quarterly.  He is possibly the foremost biblical scholar of his generation.  His “A Marginal Jew” is cited in Jesus of Nazareth  by Pope Benedict XVI. \nMeier discusses the fourth century doctrines of Mary’s perpetual virginity, but considers that the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus mentioned in the gospels are in fact blood-brothers or sisters of Jesus – he refers to the typical use of the Greek word adelphos (brother or half-brother) rather than other terms (e.g. anepsios) in common use for relationships such as cousin or step-brother – thus he rejects Jerome’s and other patristic interpretations of these relationships.  \nThe on-line CCB version of Mark includes a note affirming the traditional doctrine and asserting that ‘adelphos’ may be extended to other relationships.  I think I would prefer Meier’s scholarship on the matter ahead of the CCB editors. \nHowever another explanation, not apparently considered by Meier is possible.  Adoption was much more common in the ancient world.  High mortality rates meant that there were very many orphans.  Under both Jewish and Roman Law, adoption gave precisely the same legal rights as birth, and in that case ‘adelphos’ would seem an appropriate term for adopted siblings.  Mary and Joseph may well have had such a generous spirit.  \nIt is even conceivable that Jesus himself may have adopted one of his “brothers”, and perhaps this was the “Disciple whom Jesus loved”;  such a relationship would have been a secret one for the lad’s own protection as natural heir to the “King of the Jews”.

The “brothers and sisters” of Jesus identified in Mark 6:3 might well have been “in utero” siblings, or they may have been adoptees as a concession only. \nChasteness involves rather more than physical acts or biological physique, and is more properly attributed to an attitude in a person’s mind.  That in no way compromises any other doctrine concerning the purity, and piety of the Mother of Jesus, nor need it compromise the awe and reverence that the faithful can approach her as intercessor.

For example, there was uncertainty in displaying images of Christ for purposes of battle standards; a series of defeats determined that such displays were contrary to the divine will.  The Shroud itself displays an abject defeated Christ, and is not the stuff to inspire confidence as a protective device in the defence of cities.  Following 12 months of continuous earthquakes in Constantinople, the Image of Camulliana, the Image of God Incarnate, was kept concealed in a box for some hundreds of years, and was only opened towards the end of the first millenium. \nNevertheless there are clues.  They might be found in Galatians 3:1, the inscription of Abercius alluding to his being accompanied in his travels by an image of a “large fish”, the Edessan Bardesanic Hymn of the Pearl, the discovery of the Image of Camuliana and its parading around Cappadocia, hinits in the Mozarabic rite, the references to images “not being made by human hands”, the development of epitaphioi displaying a Shroud-like Christ, Western visitors’ reports of the burial cloths being held in Constantinople showing an image, the report of Robert de Clari, and various others. \nHowever the whole approach is one of secrecy, and there was often the underlying belief that such imagery was not for the public gaze.  This seems only to have been relieved towards the end of the Byzantine era.  This is what makes it so difficult to be specific about such evidence as there is.  It is also obvious that there was often confusion and misunderstandings in the record, with many false trails.

Paul’s first journey about 40 AD took him only as far as Iconium and ‘Antioch’ in Pisidia.  \nAdrie vd Hoeven has postulated that the Shroud was originally John Mark’s temple garment, so it is possible that Mark had it in his possession.

He seems to have picked up the idea from scientists at an Albuquerque pre-STURP conference, some of whom had been involved in the nearby atomic bomb tests. Many will recall Wilson’s illustration of a permanent shadow of a pipe-line hand valve left by the Hiroshima 1944 explosion. \nFor radiation to be the primary cause of the image, it would seem necessary to have recourse to a miraculist explanation, which seems to be the road that Giulio Fanti and his associates seem to be pursuing.  However a miraculist explanation ought only to be pursued when other explanations, particularly naturalistic explanations have been exhausted, and this is far from being the case.  Quite simply, the experimental studies have not been pursued.  No-one can say what happens to a linen cloth fabricated to the ancient processes, containing a dead body for say 36 hours given inhibition with aloes and other spices, under the right environmental conditions. \nRay Rogers succeeded in obtaining some coloration of Edgerton bleached linen treated with dextrin and saponaria on exposing it to ammonia. This is as far as experimental work has gone. It says nothing about image resolution of detail. Rogers believed that Maillard reaction was the primary cause, but also believed that it required something else.  He was dismissive of radiation being involved, because of the superficiality of the image which could not be attained by radiation. \nGiovanna de Liso’s 12 years of experiments in the moderately seismic area of Piedmont has produced to my mind some of the most promising images so far. She claims that images only formed under certain combinations of specific conditions: earthquake, release of radon gas (common in earthquakes), simultaneous variations in the geo-magnetic and electric fields, and in the presence of iron-bearing rock. It is conceivable that radon gas may have an important bearing, perhaps on collimating the molecules forming the image. Perhaps this is why the image is orthogonal apparently aligned parallel to the gravitational field. Perhaps the time-dependent instability of these molecules were a key factor in image intensity producing the 3-D effect. \nThere remains considerable scope for further research before nauralistic explanations can be excluded. Notions of a body floating in space between two parallel horizontal layers of linen being spontaneously radiated by body emanations tend to bring serious Shroud research into disrepute, and is properly labelled by skeptics as pseudo-science of the worst kind. \nThrow away the excimer lasers, and concentrate on some proper and credible scientific experimental research.

All three have a striking resemblance to the Shroud image.  There are various references to a full body image, the “Image of God Incarnate” around this time, so it was known to the Byzantines.  By contrast, copies of the Mandylion only ever show a disembodied head, and the fatal flaw in Wilson’s theory is that the Mandylion’s supposed concealed image of the body was not known until after its arrival in Constantinople in 945.  \nThe Image of Camuliana was taken to Constantinople in 572 AD, and became the basis of military labara, and became known as the “Image of God Incarnate”.  Some have attempted to identify it with the Veronica or the Veil of Manoppello, but I’ve never seen any convincing argument for this.  Others have suggested it did not survive the iconoclasm periods.  The most likely explanation, due to Markwardt is that it was hidden away following a series of continuous earthquakes in 740, after which the earthquakes ceased.  The re-enactments of Christ’s resurrection in the Pharos chapel are reported in 1201, and so it is evident that the covenant of concealment had then been broken under Alexios III.  \nO.K may be curtly dismissive of Markwardt’s thesis, if it so suits him.

One also needs to refer to his 1999 and 2008 (Ohio) papers as well.  He refers there to written accounts which assert that the Shroud was given to Peter, he was the first bishop of Antioch and so that he took it Antioch seems a fair inference.  His 2008 paper expands on this, and although various church treasures were allowed to be confiscated by Julian the Apostate, the icon was concealed to be rediscovered at a later time.  In a similar way, when Antioch was besieged by Persian Chosroes, most of the church treasures were allowed to be pillaged, but Ephraim its warrior-bishop set out on a special mission to Anatolia and was allowed to be reinstalled on his return, so his abandonment of the city was not seen as an act of cowardice. \nSoon afterwards, the Image of Camuliana was discovered and paraded around Anatolia by Byzantine priests and then taken to Constantinople.  It is the very first image which was attributed to be “acheropoeitos”, not made by human hands.  It became the template for military labara, and subsequently there are references to a full-body image by various emperors and others in Constantinople well prior to the arrival of the Mandylion there in 945.  It is a reasonable inference that this was the icon that Ephraim had taken to Anatolia, but dying before he could retrieve it. \nContrariwise the only argument that Peter may have taken the Shroud to Rome, or that it subsequently found its way to France during the first millenium, are the third century Shroud-like images in the catacombs, which might merely indicate some known acquaintance with its likeness, and flagellation scenes such as in the Carolingian Stuttgart Psalter.  There is no dovcumentary evidence, not even a myth or a legend concerning a mysterious image in Rome or elsewhere, except the later Veronica images of a Byzantine provenance. \nThere is rather more to the story of Ms Hood than appears at first sight.  It is known that wolves roamed the Black Forest in medieval times, that they sometimes ate grandmothers and little girls, and that various woodsmen there might sometimes rescue them.  As for “talking wolves” certain Pharisees were once described as “wolves in sheep’s clothing” could clearly talk, and some of them no doubt indulged in cross-dressing.  The story is a factual archetype, and if Markwardt’s paper is to be likened to a fairy story, then a better tale is needed for an analogy.

Bardesanes was a pioneer of the Christian faith in Syria who embarked on missionary work after his conversion in 179.\nHis chief writing, The Dialogue of Destiny, or The Book of the Laws of the Countries, recorded by a disciple, Philip, is the oldest known original composition in Syriac literature. Bardesanes attacked the fatalism of the Greek philosophers after Aristotle (4th century BC), particularly regarding the influence of the stars on human destiny. Mingling Christian influence with Gnostic teaching, he denied the creation of the world, of Satan, and of evil by the supreme God, attributing them to a hierarchy of deities.\nAided by his son Harmonius, Bardesanes wrote many of the first Syriac hymns to popularize his teachings. Their literary value earned for him renown in the history of Syriac poetry and music.\nOf the “Hymn of the Pearl” Markwardt writes: “Bardaisan (154-222), a Gnostic Christian, a philosopher, and the composer of numerous Syriac psalms, was born of nobility at Edessa. According to tradition, he attended school, as a youth, with the future Abgar the Great,and Segal concludes that ―certainly he frequented the court of Edessa. As the king’s life-long friend and a frequent visitor to his royal court, Bardaisan would certainly have viewed the Portrait of Edessa, perhaps when it was first presented to Abgar, and certainly after it had been placed in one of the royal palaces, and he is, no doubt, the source of the several obvious metaphorical allusions to the Shroud which appear in the Hymn of the Pearl.”\nHowever, the idea that some Gnostic artisan was able to create the Shroud image by some unknown means is utterly speculative and can have no supporting argument except speculation. There is only one case of a crucifixion victim being crowned with thorns, the random act of a Roman soldier with a perverse sense of humour. For any such Gnostic artisan to create the image from a crucifixion victim he would have to find another who had been so-crowned. The image itself contributes nothing to Gnostic argument, but on the contrary reinforces orthodox Christian belief. If the “Hymn of the Pearl” is intended to refer to the Shroud image, it is remarkable that one such as Bardesan was able to put it to such good purpose.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2014 at 6:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/08/russ-breault-and-pastor-caspar-mccloud-discuss-the-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"Russ Breault and Pastor Caspar McCloud Discuss the Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I understand that Bardesan, a notable Gnostic lived in Edessa and some credit him with having written or influenced the writing of the “Hymn of the Pearl” which is occasionally quoted by authenticists as evidence that the body image might well have been known as early as the second century.

Perhaps the one thing they had in common was the claim to posession of a “Secret Knowledge” (Gnosis). Up until about 1945 with the discovery of the Nag Hammadi scrolls, practically all that was known of the gnostics was seond-hand from their enemies the early orthodox Church Fathers. The publication of Elaine Pagels’ book “The Gnostic Gospels”, based on the Nag Hammadi texts extended the general understanding of gnosticism, although few scholars accept Pagels’ interpretation of these texts.  \nThe only possible Gnostic reference to the Shroud image is that contained in the “Hymn of the Pearl” generally attributed to Bardaisan (154-222), a “Christian Gnostic”, the author of several Syriac hymns in Edessa, a contemporary and confidant of Abgar VIII the Great, the probable instigator of the Doctrine of Addai.  At the conclusion of the Hymn of the Pearl, the Prince protagonist, who seems to be a Christ-figure, sees his robe in a new light: \n“On a sudden, as I faced it,\nThe garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself.\nI saw it all in my whole self,\nMoreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it,\nFor we were two in distinction\nAnd yet again one in one likeness.\nAnd the image of the King of kings\nWas depicted in full all over it…” \nSome writers see in these verses the image of the Shroud. It would seem to indicate that Bardaisan may have been privy to viewing the full body mage of the Shroud at the court of Edessa.

Certainly in the first few centuries of the church, the catacombs give witness to the practice of the eucharist being celebrated there.  The current use of saints’ and martyrs’ relics being included in church altar stones can be traced to this tradition.  We have recently discussed the presence of very early icons being discovered in the catacombs.  \nI should think that the mind-set which places value on relics very likely finds its origins in burial rites which go back as far as prehistoric times and can be found in most ancient civilisations.  To some extent it finds expression in the various forms of ancestor veneration, and the respect shown to the remains of the dead.  In its mildest form, the earthly remains become a sign of the value of the person’s earthly life, respect is to be shown to them, and where there is a belief in an after-life they connect us with their spirit. \nIf Charles had ever spent any time at all in the Pacific area, he would only be too well aware of the sacredness that Polynesian and Maori peoples place on their burial grounds and the human remains of ancestors, which go well beyond any Eurocentric concepts or ideas.  He may not consider this to be relevant.  On the contrary, it is a very natural and human practice indeed, and it reflects deep-seated values in the human psyche, which are more universal than one might admit. \nWhat was it that drove Saint Helena on her mission of retrieving early Christian relics from Jerusalem?  At the very least she realised how the value of such relics would add to the prestige of imperial authority, because of the natural human awe placed on such tangible objects.  There may be elements of ‘contagious magic’ associated with the cult of relics, but there are also honest motives of true piety as well.\n\n","date":"September 7, 2014 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/11/the-top-ten-relics-of-christ/","cat":"video","title":"The Top Ten Relics of Christ?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"I would really like to see a good presentation given by Russ Breault, and I know there are several available.

It is at least definitely arguable.  And it all depends on who is right, Zugibe or Barbet.  And it also depends on how the crucifixion was carried out.  There is not necessarily a majority of Shroudie medical experts who concur with Zugibe. \nWhat did Zugibe do to prove his hypothesis?  He fundamentally had a volunteer step up to a cross;  he bound his feet to the upright; and the volunteer had his hands strapped into gauntlets fastened to the crosspiece.  Let’s not kid ourselves that this represents a real crucifixion. \nDid  the crucificerius carry the full cross, or only the cross-piece?  Barbet argues that he only carried the cross-piece (patibulum) and that the upright (stipes) was already in place.  Others have asserted that he carried the full cross and after the nailing, the cross was raised and dropped into a ready made hole and stabilised maybe with a few rocks.  \nNow if it was just the cross-piece, then after the hands(wrists) had been nailed, it would be the work of not more than five men to lift the cross-piece onto the upright.  During this raising process, the full weight of the body is taken by the arms, and that would have required wrist nailing.  Once the cross-piece is in place, and at this point there is a tension of 207 lbs on each arm, (very difficult to breathe), then the feet are nailed to the upright.  This is not like stepping up to a footrest! \nIf he carried the full cross, then he is nailed to the cross with it lying on the ground.  The cross then has to be raised into position.  This is a fairly tricky process, but it might be done by placing the base of the upright near the hole and anchoring it.  Executioners then have to raise the cross, probably using ropes which have to be fastened near the top of the cross without slipping;  when it is upright, they have to get it to drop into the hole, and then stabilise it.  This is altogether a more complicated way of doing the job, and I therefore tend to favour Barbet’s scenario of cross-piece only.  \nThe gospel accounts claim that Jesus died within a few hours, and Pilate was surprised at his rapid death.  Asphyxiation seems more likely.  The Shroud image shows a distended chest, which is one reason why Barbet favoured asphyxiation as the cause of death. \nYou see indeed it is quite credible!\n\n","date":"December 1, 2015 at 12:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, from what you have written above, it seems that you may be of the view that the Mandylion and the Shroud were the same object.

To achieve this, there can be no seat (sedile) nor foot-rest.  You have a nail through the foot at the base of the second inter-meta-tarsal space, and it can only support your weight by pressing against the Lisfranc space-line separating the tarsal bones from the meta-tarsals.  That’s painful, so you transfer your weight back onto the arms.  With your arms at 65 degrees to the vertical, that results in 207 lb tension in each arm.  That’s not only painful but exhausting.  So you transfer your weight back on to your feet.  Etc, etc.  \nThe distended chest of the shroud image gives it away as cause of death by asphyxiation.  Pilate was amazed at the rapid death.

They strain at gnats and swallow camels. With no formal training in Critical Thinking, they fail to understand the  concept of ‘weight of evidence’ as far as all the properties and other features of the TS is concerned. The TS is a challenge to their particular world-view, and creates a chronic anxiety that this world-view of theirs may indeed be false.\nConcerning the mixing of kinds, there is no Judaic prohibition on mixing cotton with linen. The prohibition relates to the mixing of animal and vegetable products sucj as the mixing of cotton or linen with wool. It is possible that its origins  may have been associated with the practice of pagan priests mixing these products in their garments, or else to restrain lower orders from wearing expensive linen. Its religious significance comes from the concept of distinctions whereby Yaweh’s people of Israel were to be separate from gentiles. \nConcerning the mixing of cotton with linen:\nIts earliest occurrence commenced in Egypt about 200AD with the manufacture of fustian, whereby cotton and linen were used separately for warp and weft threads to compensate for the weaker properties of the other, expense, brittleness, susceptibility to dyes, etc. It slowly spread through North Africa, not reaching Spain until the 13th century. \nCotton found its way to Italy possibly as early as the 13th century. Bulk cotton and linen fibres were stored in the same spinning work-rooms, the cotton permeating the air, getting on the clothes of the spinners and contaminating linen thread. Cotton as a contaminant of linen would therefore date from this era. There is no such contaminating cotton in the linen threads of the TS, except for that in the Raes area. I have seen several photographs of many of the STURP scientists minutely examining the TS for signs of cotton with microscopes. None of them found any cotton. \nPossible sources of surface contamination, include the stitching of the 1534 patches with cotton, and perhaps the cotton gloves used by the STURP team. \nFrom about the 13th century, cotton was deliberately mixed with linen for a number of reasons: it bulked out the more expensive linen; it compensated the brittleness of linen, and would accept dyes more readily. On the other hand linen was more durable and longer lasting, as lacking pectin needed by moths it was more resistant to insect attack. \nRaes discovery of cotton in his sample, found its way into Ian Wilson’s 1978 book, leading to the speculation that it was more pervasive, and that perhaps the cloth had been woven on looms also used for weaving cotton, and it was therefore of Middle East provenance.  That speculation is no longer viable.  \nUntil 1842, the Savoy showings of the TS were always displayed by five bishops holding it along its edge, often in the open air, doubtless with prospects of all sorts of contamination, and damage to the cloth. There are several different illustration of these events on record. Even bishops in those days did not take regular showers! \nIn 1868, Princess Clotilde replaced Valfre’s lining with a new red silk lining. She may well have been the one who carried out the evident repair in the Raes area. She had the skills, and the resources. From 1868, the manual displays had ceased, and from that date, the displays were always held in a static frame. If Clotilde did the repair work, that would certainly account for the skewing of the C-14 date. It may also account for the decision to abandon the manual displays. \nThere is much more evidence corroborating the authenticity of the TS, than the mere absence of cotton in its main body. They include the absence of vanillin as one such. However the absence of cotton is merely another link in the chain of evidence, which places its provenance well before the 1355 display at Lirey. \nGet over it! You’re wrong!

On the same page, next paragraph, Wilson is quoting the cloth dimensions in feet and inches, so we might surmise the figures mean ‘threads per inch’.

The bolt was then expertly cut lengthwise, firstly for the main cloth of the Shroud, and then secondly for a narrow side strip. The two raw edges were then expertly sewn together, so that the final Shroud cloth presented two selvedges on its two outside edges. The seam was not visible from the face side and was only revealed when the backing cloth was removed. It seems that in her 40 years of working with ancient textiles, Mme F-L had only come across this type of invisible seam only once before, on the 1st century textiles found at Masada. Wilson provides a diagram of the seam from a Masada cloth sample.

Alternative options that might need considering are that if it was a temple garment, it may have been Joseph’s own garment, or if not, perhaps Joseph had intended it to be his own burial shroud, as until the time of Gamaliel II (2nd century), it was quite normal for Jewish burials to include items of considerable expense. Plain-weave shrouds only became fashionable for the wealthy after Gamaliel II. \nA major reservation I have with the paper is her apparent identification of John Mark as seemingly the author of both the second and fourth gospels, the beloved disciple, the young man who ran away naked during Jesus’ arrest, and the temple secretary.  I am unaware of any authority who would make the same identification, and I feel there is much that can be said against it. \nJohn Mark is conventionally thought of as being the author of the second gospel (a source for Matthew’s and Luke’s), the cousin of Barnabas, who according to Acts deserted Paul during his mission to the gentiles, whose mother’s house in Jerusalem was a centre for the apostles to where Peter fled after his release from prison; probably the amanuensis to Peter in Rome, and who seemed later to recover Pauls’ favour and also assisted him; and who later is said to have founded the church in Alexandria where he is said to have died. He may have been the young man who fled naked in the garden.  \nBy contrast, the author of the fourth gospel is said to have written it in Ephesus, dying there at an advanced age, is generally identified as the disciple who Jesus loved and who lay on his breast at the Last Supper, could have been one of the sons of Zebedee, and a fisherman in Galilee, seeming unlikely material for a temple secretary.  \nAs the identification that Adrie makes, seems to make up a significant component of her paper, I feel that this attempt at overstating her case is likely to run into serious objections, and the paper may unjustifiably stand to fail on this account. I feel nevertheless that she has made a credible argument for the Shroud cloth having been a temple garment, which may even have been John Mark’s. However I also feel that other explanations are also possible and cannot be entirely excluded.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2013 at 6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/29/paper-chase-the-seam-and-missing-corners-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Much of the Danish work seems to have been done by Karin Margarita Frei (connections with Max Frei?? – just speculating).  My chemistry is limited, but I note that altho’ 87Sr and 86Sr are both stable isotopes themselves, the amount of 87Sr has been increasing over time because it is also a decay product of 87Rb, and this is said to be evident in meteorites.  Is there a possibility that this may compromise its value as a provenance indicator of ancient textiles?  Thus we may know the 87/86Sr ratios of an ancient textile, which may have remained unchanged over time, but is it valid to compare this with a present geographic / geologic region if the ratio in that regions may have changed because of decay of 87Rb?  Can anyone elucidate?  If this is a potential problem, would it not then be valid to compare textiles of comparitive ages if the provenance of any one of them were known?

At this point, Adrie postulates that the other disciple is John Mark, wondering if the burial cloth seen there is indeed his temple garment. This disciple whom Jesus loved is more conventionally thought of as being behind the authorship of this gospel, and is more usually thought of as being the son of Zebedee in Galilee. I find it more credible that John Mark as mentioned in Acts Paul’s epistles and I Peter, the likely author of the second gospel, is a different and distinct person from the John mentioned in the fourth gospel as the disciple whom Jesus loved as a euphemism for the author of that gospel, and who hesitated at the entrance of the tomb.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2013 at 7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/29/paper-chase-the-seam-and-missing-corners-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Each of the four gospels has a short section on the calling of the first few disciples. The Synoptics all have a reasonably consistent story of this event, although Luke gives a slightly different version of it. In John however the 3rd and 4th disciples have different names from those in the Synoptics, and it is a different story. \nIn both Matthew and Mark, the event takes place at the Lake of Galilee and all four are fishermen, Simon and his brother Andrew are called, together with their partners James and John, the sons of Zebedee; Mt 4:18-22; Mk 1:16-20. Luke does not mention Andrew, but it is still a fishing scene; Jesus gets into Simon’s boat, preaches, a sub-story of a large catch of fish is added in, the three of them then follow Jesus; Lk 5:1-11. In John the story is different. Jesus passes by where John the Baptizer is preaching with two of his disciples, the Baptizer comments “Look there is the lamb of God!” Hearing this the two disciples catch up with Jesus and asks him to show where he lives. One of the disciples was Andrew “the brother of Simon Peter”. Early next morning Andrew meets his brother Simon saying “We have found the Messiah” and takes Simon to Jesus. The next day Jesus meets Philip and says “Follow me.” Philip finds Nathanael, and an interchange between Jesus and Nathanael follows concerning Jesus seeing him under a fig tree, consistent with John’s presenting Jesus as a person with special supernatural knowledge; Jn 1:35-50. \nIn view of the disparities between the 2nd and 4th gospels descibing the calling of the first disciples, there has to be a conclusion that the two gospels were written by two different authors. If the young man who loses his linen cloth in Mark’s gospel is the author of that gospel (Why else mention the incident?) then he cannot be the same person identified as the “beloved disciple” which appears to be a euphemism for the disciple associated with the writing of the fourth gospel. In that case the Adrie hypothesis that the two men are one and the same person has to fail.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2013 at 1:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/29/paper-chase-the-seam-and-missing-corners-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"At the core of Adrie’s story construction of the burial garment, is the loss of the young man’s linen cloth in the garden. The story is only recounted in the second gospel and nowhere else. For this reason commentators have tended to identify the person as that gospel’s author.  From Papias 2nd century, the traditional author of the second gospel is said to have been Mark, Peter’s amenuensis in Rome. Mark’s role as amenuensis is supported by the closing verses of I Peter, although that epistle is said there to have been transcribed by Silvanus.  \nI find it difficult to ascribe the complex fourth gospel to John the son of Zebedee, a fisherman, although it seems that this John did finish up in Ephesus.  He could well have been the witness referred to in the conclusion of that gospel and provided the oral tradition for much of the narrative. If the long and complex farewell discourses are the authentic words of Jesus, then someone must have written them down at the time or soon after. An alternative view is that the gospel was written by John a presbyter. The gospel is extremely complex operating at several levels, and a more likely explanation might ascribe it to a Johannine school in Ephesus, with contributing elements from various ones, but finally synthesised into a unitary whole, perhaps by a single author and some additional later glosses by others. \nOnly a linguistic analysis of the second and fourth gospels could detect if they were the same author, but in view of the lapse of time between their writings, this may not even be successful, as writers will develop their vocabulary and style over such a period. I suspect that any analysis would conclude that they were different authors.\nPart of the difficulty in identifying the various participants is the very limited number of first names available in first century Palestine, and any single name whom we may assume is attributed to a single person may in fact belong to several.\n\n","date":"April 29, 2013 at 4:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/29/paper-chase-the-seam-and-missing-corners-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"daveb_of_wellington_nz","post":"Max, I don’t think I have a problem with that, and I recall we have discussed this very thoroughly in another recent posting.  It is Papias who says that the second gospel was written by Mark, although apparently Papias also makes the reservation, “although not in the right order”, whatever he might have meant by that. The way I read Adrie’s paper is that she identifies the “beloved disciple” in the 4th gospel as John Mark.  I think it is more a euphemism for the disciple associated with the writing of the 4th gospel. The fourth gospel is the only one to use that expression.  Now following your argument that “Mark” is setting down Peter’s version, he would be aware of that gospel’s section on the calling of the first four disciples.  But in the fourth gospel, this story is quite different.  So I maintain that the “John” associated with the writing of the fourth gospel cannot be the “Mark” associated with the second gospel, who seems to be the “John Mark” mentioned in Acts 12 and elsewhere. If you do not see that as a persuasive argument, can you provide sufficient reasons for identifying John Mark as the “beloved disciple” in the fourth gospel? That would then argue that this “beloved diciple” is not in fact associated with the authorship of the fourth gospel at all, because of the disparity of the two stories I’ve mentioned.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2013 at 7:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/29/paper-chase-the-seam-and-missing-corners-of-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud"}]}
