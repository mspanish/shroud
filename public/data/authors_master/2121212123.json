Fanti never claimed that. You are wrong. Dr. Di Lazzaro used VUV (vacuum UV). So, I hope you’ll want to be more exact in your writings. Perhaps you wanted to write: “Giulio Fanti’s claimed that Corona Discharge effects…” or: “Giulio Fanti’s claimed that Corona Discharge and UV effects…” (because he indicated us something similar the “brilliant Body of Resurrected Jesus” that passed through the linen cloth, something similar the Jackson’s hypothesis…). * * * * * Here Particular References: 1 “Forces of the Quantum Vacuum” An Introduction to Casimir Physics Edited by: William M R Simpson (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel), Ulf Leonhardt (The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) Link: http://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9383 >Forces of the Quantum Vacuum presents a number of theoretical approaches to Casimir, van der Waals and Casimir–Polder forces that have been fruitfully employed in mainstream research, and also reviews the experimental evidence for Casimir forces. … etc. … 2 “Quantum vacuum energies and Casimir forces between partially transparent δ function plates” J.
