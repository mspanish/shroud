Actually the Shroud image ALIKE the Image of Edessa (in Yeshu’a’s likeness) can be described as “an imprint” and “a moist secretion with no paint or artistic craft, transferred with no artistic intervention onto the cloth”. Another historian, Ian Wilson, can see the relevance re the two characteristics if Charles Freeman just can’t Besides ALIKE the cloth of Edessa, (see The Acts of Holy Apostle Thaddaeus, –6th Century CE– that calls the cloth a tetradiplon (cloth doubled-in-four-layers),  a Greek term that only appears twice in historical texts, and both times refers to the Image of Edessa, the Turin Shroud was doubled in four layers (see the symetrical burn-marks as proof).

Still the fact remains, most  curiously Max has been silenced from August the 10th 2015 onward i.e. just after Louis (a freelance journalist) asked Dan to do sthg about Max as the latter challenged Louis to prove his exegesis of Jn (the empty tomb episode) was wrong (Louis with his mouth full of the name of “his giant” in Biblical exegesis disdainfully told Max he “would be laughed out of court”. However Louis has NEVER substantiated his claim and demostrate Max’s exegesis was wrong and did ask Dan to Silence Max, which Dan did.Until proven otherwise, Max WAS kicked out of Dan’s blog and Louis did have SOMEthing to do with this.Max showed me several emails he sent Dan and the latter had not even the courtesy to reply (Max last email dates back to December the 4th, 2015.
