I don’t understand why community bothers you so.  Pelican was once part of the A-blog community (and was as off-topic and chatty as anyone), and Colin could become part of it still.  \nWaPo already knows about the A-blog’s off-topic tendencies and is OK with them.  There are other WaPo blogs that do the same thing, btw.  For better or worse, that’s how it is.  WaPo wants to keep all of them going.  If you disagree, contact Marty Baron,  \nCommunity blogs exist at other media outlets as well and proprietors often welcome them.  If it doesn’t resonate with you, that’s your prerogative.  I hope you find what you seek elsewhere.\n","date":"February 19, 2014 at 11:35 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/brief-message-to-joel-achenbach-washington-post-re-your-hijacked-posting-on-pseudoscience-and-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"chatroom","title":"Brief message to Joel Achenbach, Washington Post, re your hijacked posting on pseudoscience and the Turin Shroud"}]}
