I went to look at the video stream. I get this message that reads, “We apologize. The content is not available due to copyright restrictions.” THANKS A LOT FOR NOTHING Wondering what is going on, I log onto http://www.sindone.org, the official Holy Shroud web site run by the Archdiocese of Turin. There are a couple of pages in Italian that say nothing meaningful. If I click on the English tab, the pages that come up are leftovers from the 2010 exhibition. THEY HAVEN’T UPDATED THE OFFICIAL HOLY SHROUD WEBSITE IN THREE YEARS. I then tried the much ballyhooed i Phone app. It is one of the worst apps I have ever downloaded from the Apple i Tunes store. It is free but you have to pay the Apple store $3.99 for the data. %he app they are pushing questionable science and history in awful English. For instance, “Some sources seem to consider the possibility that these linens would also guard the image of God. The relics are certified in Jerusalem and Constantinople. Whereas the hypothesis connecting the Shroud to the Knights Templar is to be rejected, since there are no evidences.” YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ENGLISH TO READ THROUGH THE TRANSLATED TEXT..","date":"2013-03-30","mins":"7:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/awaiting-live-stream-from-rai-uno/","cat":"event","title":"Awaiting Live Stream from RAI Uno"}]}
