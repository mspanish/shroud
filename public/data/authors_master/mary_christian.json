{"art":[{"author":"mary_christian","post":"i have been amazed at the similarities between Akiane’s Jesus and the image that i found from a friend that was the likeness of Jesus just as He appeared to me in the middle of the night when I got up to get a drink.  He looked right through me as if to know everything i ever did and thought and all my concerns or questions were immediately stilled and satisfied in this bath of permeating love.  When I looked into His eyes they were like a tunnel of blue flickering gems (but they werent gems. but they were soooo crystally and blue) and it seemed i was looking into eternity.   Later God revealed to me they were flickering because they were flames… the hottest kind!  the air was prismatic with a million different colors but all white at the same time. and same with Jesus- i knew his beard was brown, etc.. but it was all washed in perfect white.see pic of Jesus:(copy and paste it into your browser at the top of your screen.)take a look at the painting of what Jesus looked like when He appeared to me.  I think you will enjoy comparing this with akiane’s work.  they are strikingly similar.","date":"September 29, 2011 at 12:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"mary_christian","post":"hi friend peter clarke.when Jesus came to me in my room and captured my gaze with His, His eyes were flickering blue like sapphire but with lots of light.  i felt like i was looking into a tunnel of eternity in his eyes.  it was almost 5 years later when i finally asked him about His eyes and He revealed to me that they were fire… and when that puzzled me, He said they are the hottest flame.  I posted the whole story just this week if you scroll down.","date":"September 30, 2011 at 12:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"mary_christian","post":"so it sounds like there was more on the letter besides the line you quoted, but you forgot? i had a similar experience when God came to me… He was speaking the most profound and eloquent words… i dont even know if i knew what they were in my brain but my spirit could understand everything.. they were beauty and love and poetic and perfect.  but i couldnt remember a lick of them when i awoke.  But i know this- they fed my spirit-man which is fortified only from heaven (God) and that is the part of me I want fed more than any other! You may have experienced a true sight when you are only able to see/hear/percieve with spiritual eyes.  Hebrews 12 talks about a very real, present spiritual reality (note part where he mentions “city”)22But you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly, 23to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirits of righteous men made perfect, 24to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.25See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks.","date":"September 30, 2011 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
