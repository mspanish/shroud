I couldn’t understand how parents can be so cruel to their children, it broke my heart knowing that the person I loved had to suffer so much during his childhood. I wish I would’ve been there for him when he was little as well as for you. Like Mary said, pray the Lord to heal your spiritual and emotional wounds. There is a very special place for you in heaven. Your suffering on earth would be compensated when the time comes. Hang in there, open your heart to the Lord, maybe, if you listen carefully to Him, He will tell you the purpose of your suffering, maybe He will guide you to make good use of your experiences. I will keep you in my prayers. Blessings to you.
