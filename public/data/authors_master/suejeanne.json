In 1981, there was a wonderful exhibit at Brooks Institute in Santa Barbara about the research on the Shroud – I went to that (having recently started taking classes to become a Catholic, I read about the exhibit in a Catholic newspaper I found at church) – there were cards of various sizes with the image on it, I bought quite a few of them to give to friends and relatives – I was just so thrilled to have seen this. Couldn’t it have been like a photograph imprinted on the cloth from incredible light emanating during the Lord’s resurrection? It was nice to see Mr. Swortz on the program – I always look for him when I hear there is something on the tv about the Shroud..","date":"2011-01-26","mins":"5:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/25/reminder-the-real-face-of-jesus-airs-today-on-the-history-channel/","cat":"video","title":"Reminder: The Real Face of Jesus Airs Today on the History Channel"}]}
