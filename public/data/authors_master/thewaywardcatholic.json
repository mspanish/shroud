{"misc":[{"author":"thewaywardcatholic","post":"First, thank you for linking to my article in the Guardian Express. \nSecond, I didn’t mean to imply that Protestants don’t believe the Shroud is real. My point was that there are some out there, whether Protestant, Catholics, non-Christians or non-religious who try to dispute relics, not only of the Catholic faith but also of the Christian faith claiming they are somehow faked. I used the history of the Shroud as an example of how, as our science continues to get better, we are able to provide more proof as the authenticity of such relics and articles. \nThe greater point of the article, as this is an opinion piece written by a Catholic, is how every time a pope says something, the secular press jumps on it saying the Pope is going to change church doctrine, etc. etc. which are usually taken out of context.\nAgain, thank you for commenting and linking to my article. \nPaul Roy\n\n","date":"November 28, 2013 at 8:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/28/a-quote-you-wont-want-to-use/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Quote You Won’t Want to Use"}]}
