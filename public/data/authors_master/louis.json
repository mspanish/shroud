As a man Jesus would eat when he was hungry, drink when he wanted to do so (much more than John the Baptizer), sleep when he was tired, and so forth. He could thus marry.The Mary Magdalene issue came under the limelight with the so-called Jesus family tomb, proposing that all the “family” members were buried in Talpiot. However, this book and documentary are agenda- driven. They were also meant to try to demonstrate that as a rabbi Jesus would have to marry.The problem is that Jesus was not a rabbi in the conventional sense, he could only have been a rabbi in the broad sense. He assumed more than one role in his earthly ministry. Why should he have to be married? Jeremiah was single. Was John the Baptizer married? Did he pitch a tent to live with a wife in the wilderness?The tomb topic caused such a sensation that the Princeton conference was held in Jerusalem. It was then that I asked Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ, Emeritus Professor of Biblical Studies at Catholic University of America, Washington DC, if he would attend. He told me that he wouldn’t although he had been invited, in fact he was coming close to retirement then.Earlier, Father Fitzmyer had been invited to examine the Aramaic inscription on the “James ossuary” on display in Toronto. The ossuary had been the topic of a book by Hershel Shanks and Ben Witherington III, an interesting work,with some unjustified conclusions. He also reviewed the book on the “Jesus family tomb”. His points of view, as one of world’s top biblical scholars — who translated ancient Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Greek and Latin texts into English — were of paramount importance.The truth about what can be learned about Mary Magdalene ( Father Fitzmyer’s interpretation of ancient Greek texts and review of a book that appeared after the Princeton conference) can be found in the following:https://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Parts_I_and_IIand:https://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Parts_I_and_IIKaren King has been pushing her agenda-driven hypotheses a bit too far.

While I personally do not find it difficult to accept what you call “accumulation of circumstances”, that surely will not be welcome by anti-authenticists. More will be needed to convince them, and it will have to be a lot more convincing than what has sometimes been published on the relic so far:https://www.academia.edu/6568383/Does_the_Shroud_show_a_Mandaean_burialLet me know if you were able to open the file.More recently,it has been argued that the Jospice Mattress Imprint was painted and this, too, will be tackled shortly.

The more you clutch at straws, the less will you be able to convince sceptics.Thanks for the link to the video, which I will watch later today and comment on later. Teilhard had foresight, he mingled science with systematic theology because he knew what was to come, more than many other clergymen, but not all questions were answered. Remember that Pope John Paul II said the Shroud takes us to the “mystery of life and death”, but he also criticised what he judged to be Buddhism’s negative soteriology in his book “Crossing the Threshold of Hope”.We cannot sweep the mysterium iniquitatis under the rug, and I am sure you know we are surrounded by it. One can see your efforts to get above it, others don’t even try. When Father Victor White lay dying after a motorcycle accident, Jung could not visit him because he was very old and the doctor’s advice was for him not to travel.

The NYT news item just serves to demonstrate that the geologist is clutching at straws, the money is not his, it came from those who are behind the agendas,who it seems also have funds to squander. The same also can be said about the Swiss millionaire whose identity was not revealed, for obvious reasons, and who was behind the “Jesus’ wife” fragment that Karen King, with her own agenda, was actively promoting. Good for Harvard, they were about to leap by publishing a report, then decided to look before leaping, and gave up the idea. It is now clear that the fragment of the papyrus was manufactured, is fraudulent, as maintained by me on this very blog right from the beginning, though it was defended by another commenter.Professor Wolfgang Krumbein has contradicted himself. In the beginning he said the James ossuary was exposed to sunlight and environmental conditions for centuries. Later, he alleged that robbers had opened a hole in the Talpiot tomb and stolen  it, another one clutching at straws. Not even the owner, O.Golan,believes him, because he had already said, years ago,that it came from Silwan.The claims about the patina came from Charles Pellegrino, however he did not publish a scientific paper because he is not an archaeologist and, I think, he does know that it will simply not sell. Patina can be manufactured, and the IAA returned the James ossuary to its owner, also making the statement that the second part of the inscription was a forgery, as I had always maintained, in fact published an article about it three months before the IAA statement. We have to be very careful while reading news items about “findings” in the fields of biblical archaeology and biblical studies.Talpiot IV will be written shortly, meanwhile the rest of the story, for those who are interested:  https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_III","date":"April 9, 2015 at 7:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/09/art-scholars-on-scientific-evidence/","cat":"art","title":"Art Scholars on Scientific Evidence"},{"author":"louis","post":"It must also be noted that nothing is being said about the fact that geologist Aryeh Shimron is not an expert in limestone ossuaries,he knows about plaster. He says that an earthquake in the fourth century filled the tomb with soil, but how is it that it did not happen to another tomb, just twenty metres away? Not even O.Golan, the owner of the James ossuary, believes his story. He wants at least 300 tombs to be examined.Andrey Feuerverger, who worked on the statistics, was misled by the proponents of the so-called Jesus family tomb to interpret the inscription on one ossuary as identifying Mary Magdalene. He admitted that later and wisely wrote in his report that “any tampering with the tombsite and other possibilities for fraud” would have to be “weighed and taken into account.” He abandoned the topic completely after the sensationalism. The University of Chicago professor mentioned in the article (link) above is even wiser,Patina is also not considered to be a reliable indication, it can be manufactured. In an official report written years ago Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem District Archaeologist, wrote that the patina “inside the relatively deep letters is not the same as on the ossuary’s four sides and the decoration lines.”Why?There is more:Shimron ignores a telltale incision, known by the best scholars. About this, Professor Kloner wrote:“each of the letters of the two words “brother of Jesus” are carved less deeply than those on the right side of the inscription.”Note: “brother of Jesus” is “Akhui d’Yeshua” in Aramaic, therefore Kloner says “two words”. the right side says “Yaakov bar Yehosef”, “James son of Joseph” in Aramaic.What does this mean? Two hands and two chisels — and two different periods.","date":"April 10, 2015 at 6:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/09/art-scholars-on-scientific-evidence/","cat":"art","title":"Art Scholars on Scientific Evidence"},{"author":"louis","post":"Further to the above,there is an interesting article entitled “The Master’s Tomb in Jerusalem: Apostolic Memory from the First Century” on the website of the Beth Immanuel Sabbath Fellowship, an Orthodox Messianic Jewish congregation in Hudson, Wisconsin.The article mentions the inscription “In dumum Domini ibimus”, meaning “Let us go the house of the Lord”.

The textiles were dated to AD 73, at which point the Zealots were still active. The Sadducees, Pharisees and Judaeo-Christians had no connections with this group. To say that the textile with the “L” denotes Christian presence in the region in the first century is like saying that the Gospels are fairy tales, filled with lies. Judaeo-Christians and Zealots had nothing to do with each other. If the two groups are mixed then it will mean that Jesus was quasi- zealot, the reason why he was nailed to the cross, and I don’t know whether believing Christians will countenance that.Masada has it myths, largely because Josephus was not always accurate. That is why it is no longer considered a symbol of Jewish resistance/nationalism. Many of the human bones buried there were found together with those of pigs. These could be the result of Roman burials with blood (animal) sacrifice.It is possible that there was Christian presence there, but not before Christianity had been recognised by the State, around the fifth to the sixth centuries.","date":"July 23, 2014 at 7:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/22/origin-of-the-gammadia/","cat":"art","title":"Origin of the Gammadia"},{"author":"louis","post":"Scripture has nothing to say about the exact moment when Joseph deposited the body in the burial cloth.

I hope to be able post it online with an English translation.From my point of view, IW challenges the reweaving hypothesis because he was the first Shroud scholar to examine it closely and did not observe any patch. Of course, the patch is said to have been invisible because of the stitching and, for me at least, it still is one among many hypotheses on how the 1988 carbon dating results may have been skewed. IW also demonstrated support for Dr. Garza-Valdés and that was because of the relic’s surface. Today, no scientist would admit that the bacteria would be sufficient to skew the results, the contamination would have to be much more.    One must remember that Oxford is willing to open the doors of the laboratory for fresh carbon dating, but then is there any hypothesis that is accepted by each and everyone in the realm of Shroud studies and beyond it? It is for this reason that I think IW is right in saying that it is not necessary to appeal to the laboratory.There are things in this world that are sort of “unseen”, they work behind the scenes, dropping hints, appearing spontaneously, influencing people to change their minds.

The reasons are in the book you cited and I, for one, am convinced.Now, tell me, if fresh carbon dating does not give a first-century date what will happen? There will be an uproar and Shroud scientists, historians, enthusiasts will have dozens of articles and papers, pdf or not, peer-reviewed or not, and the problem will still not be solved.

It is not that famous one preserved in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. We now now that the burial place was “honeycombed with tombs”, to quote Bahat, so how many dead bodies were washed on the “stone of unction”? Jesus was the only one who had his dead body washed on this “stone of unction”? Does the NT say that the body was washed? No, it doesn’t. Did the artist think about this?If the artist intended to show a sarcophagus,then he had little culture, he was mixing Egypt with Israel, mixing Jesus with a pharaoh.Did the artist think about the door of the tomb?

Since the relic is unique, as demonstrated by all the studies conducted so far, many people do think that it was the cloth that wrapped Jesus as he lay in the sepulchre. What is certainly difficult to agree with is Wesselow’s theory that it led to the birth of Christianity.Then, there appear to have been early traditions that were not put down on paper, such as the veneration of the Virgin Mary, which even reached Islam, in fact she is mentioned more times than Jesus in the Koran.The great frustration for Shroud scholars is that much was deliberately destroyed in Edessa, and a lot was stolen or even destroyed when Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade, so it is clear that there is no choice but to rely more on science to see how much more can be learned.Yet, even if the Shroud is proved to be genuine, it would still not answer many existential issues that are constantly raised.From my point of view, and for Christians at least, it appears to be understanding what is meant by “mysterium Christi”.","date":"September 9, 2012 at 5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/06/quote-for-today-hans-belting-and-commentary/","cat":"art","title":"Quote for Today: Hans Belting and commentary"},{"author":"louis","post":"Some food for thought“Knowing Jesus.

More data is needed,both in the case of the TS and the “Veronica”.  Did you see what Phil Dayvault found in Turkey?

Pope John Paul II signed an agreement with the Arab prelate Mar Dinkha of the Assyrian Church of the East, of Iraqi origin, bringing the Catholic and at least one Orthodox Church together when it comes to doctrinal issues. The same cannot be said about the Orthodox Churches in Egypt. Pope Benedict XVI referred to von Harnack during the speech he delivered at Regensburg University, aware that the Lutheran Church also has some difficulties when it comes to this point, not least because Martin Luther also grappled with it. To go further, both Harnack and Albert Schweitzer had problems with the Lutheran Church in which they were raised precisely because of this, distancing themselves from the institution while remaining Christians, in the broad sense of the term.David: You agree with what I stated in #14 on the rock and the earthquake in the last line of your above comment by giving a very plausible explanation about what really may have happened.

There is a key to understand this extremely important detail and it was given by Jesus himself: do not be guided by the material world, the truth lies beyond what is material. This fact was further interpreted by the gnostics and eventually led to the Creed as defined at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325. The problem was whether to interpret Jesus as half-human, half-divine or fully divine and not human.

It is a highly complex topic on which I am working and will write about when there is time.Scripture can leave people confused at times and has confounded scholars.

It is for that reason that there is now   an “Annotated Jewish New Testament”, a Jewish interpretation and a nice job, not drifting from the Jewish milieu.The Jews never denied the crucifixion. Not long ago the Israeli writer Amoz Oz wrote that guilty conscience was invented in his country 2000 years ago. Lest I be misunderstood, I hasten to say that there can be no accusation of “Christ killers”. The Gospels narratives leave no room for doubts that both Roman and Temple authorities were responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion and death. According the late Pinchas Lapide,who was a respected Jewish scholar and holocaust survivor, the Temple authorities handed Jesus over to the Romans.No Jewish archaeologist or scholar has any doubt that Jesus was crucified and buried in Jerusalem. It is some unfounded claims that led to the controversy about the place of burial in Jerusalem, but no doubt was expressed about the crucifxion, death and burial in Jerusalem: https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_IIIThere are claims that some pathologists in Europe have stated that Jesus survived the crucifixion.

It will not convince anyone at the other end that Jesus was buried in Kashmir, despite my article, the link to which is above, on this thread.The centuries that followed Christianity were marked by gnosticism and an obsession with monotheism. We see the results today with non-Christian scholars challenging the beliefs of the “Abrahamic faiths”, insisting that new discoveries in science demonstrate that they are wrong. In fact, this began in the eighteenth century, when Sir Francis Younghusband was told by Hindu scholars that the Genesis creation account did not correspond to reality.Freud only concentrated on the Bible’s monotheism in his book “Moses and Monotheism”, and did not take other cultures into account:   https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds_incomplete_speculation_on_monotheismC.G.Jung went much further, although he was baffled in India when he found that good and evil could exist together with no problems.It is important to remember that in the next few decades there will have to be a science-theology dialogue where “what kind of monotheism is there” will have to be discussed.It is wrong to think that racism only existed in some cultures. The Muslim arabs imported black slaves from Zanzibar and the Portuguese are said to have learnt from them. Racism is is there in Israel,in India (with the caste system) and in other cultures and among people of all religions. “The lighter the colour of your skin, the better” is something one sees in all cultures.The British may have been brutal in India at times, but that did not prevent M.Gandhi from being “obsessed” with Christ, to the extent of being accused of being a Christian secretly. He was so influenced by the Sermon on the Mount, that it became the basis of his “Ahimsa” (non-violent resistance), that ultimately led to the country’s independence. Christ is generally recognised as avatar, incarnation of God, by the Hindus. They did not mix things up, rejecting Christ because of occasional British brutality.The Jesus in Kashmir story has nothing to do with colonialism, slavery and so on, it is based on religious belief.","date":"August 31, 2015 at 7:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

Anyone who has read enough about the topic knows that this hypothesis has been dismissed by the topmost scholars. So what did he do? He has appealed to the Patio tomb, twenty metres away, bringing in yet another theory, based on flimsy evidence. He went to the extent of bringing world-renowned epigrapher Father Émile Puech into the scene to show the less accurate of two replicas of the so-called Jonah ossuary leading the priest into a trap, the same thing he did with Professor François Bovon, who died last week. Nothing has been proved, but that does not deter him. He also smiled when Father Puech told him that Jesus was resurrected and so there could be no remains in any ossuary.Realising that this second theory is also bound to fall apart, he has now announced a (bombastic) book and documentary to be launched together with Discovery in a few months time. And what is it about? It is about “God’s bride”, that is, Jesus and Mary Magdalene. And what is it based on? A fourth-century, repeat, fourth century, gnostic document. Worse, he has twisted the meaning of one line to suit his fancies. Well, by now he should know that he will not have the success he expects because the flaws have already been shown by some of the world’s best scholars.Jacobovici is also one-track minded, he has not studied enough, and if he did he would think twice about what he is proposing, realising that he faces the possibility of being swallowed by quicksand in the very beach he is taking us to see some entertainment which he is advertising as serious studies. He who smiles last smiles most.We should avoid extreme positions, whether it comes to the TS or to developments in Biblical Archaeology.","date":"November 6, 2013 at 5:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/blowing-the-antonacci-proposal-to-bits/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Blowing the Antonacci Proposal to bits"},{"author":"louis","post":"Professor Giulio Fanti wrote about the earthquake in connection with his image-formation hypothesis, not as something to do with how the 1988 CD results were skewed.

Unfortunately a “group mind” has been formed on this blog and it is being contagious, newcomers on the Shroud scene inheriting the characteristics of some of the older Shroudies, part of an “inner circle” which decides what can be published, what should be suppressed, what should be ignored, doors only open to chummies who dance to a pre-determined tune. Why be surprised that many scholars whose contributions could be of immense importance have refused to enter the realm of Shroud studies? Are they blindfolded? Is their intelligence also being underestimated?To go more deeply into this “group mind” we have Gustave le Bon, who influenced Freud.

But, to cut a long story short, let us start with the fact that the papal custodian Cardinal Anastasio Balestrero ignored the letter sent to him by Dr. Harry Gove et al. The letter warned that “fundamental modification in the proposed procedures may lead to failure” The number of laboratories were reduced to three and the protocols prepared by Dr. Carlos Chagas, President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, were rejected apparently due to the pressure exerted by Professor Luigi Gonella.There was some discussion a few days ago about the laboratories in which thread Charles commented a few things, defending them against what he considered could be judged as libel. It is obvious that the laboratories wanted to be in the limelight and chose to ignore the protocols, that is why he was asked about them.One bad mistake STURP made was to not include a textile specialist in the team and no expert from this field was present when the sample was taken. As I. Wilson wisely noted, “the choice of site for that one sample being well documented as having been subjected to prolonged, repeated handling throughout centuries.” Worse, no chemical analysis of the sample was made. God knows what else was in the sample other than just pure linen. So what we have here is a succession of errors that makes Rogers paper worthy of consideration.

Naturally, it is important —- to a certain extent —- to learn and be guided by what science can tell us as long as we don’t drift into scientism, that is one of the reasons why I have always had a high regard for Gould.

The same book also says that Jesus was a bastard. Is that what you want? Further, whatever it says, Jesus was executed as a criminal, not as a saint. The Sadducees did not believe in the after-life, whether the burial cloth was black, white, purple or green would make no difference to them. We can presume that  it was white because Joseph bought it, and he did not believe that Jesus was a criminal. Moreover, by handling the body he became ritually clean, unable to go to the Temple, which also signified a break with the Temple leadership. It was a hasty burial, the the body must have been left with the minimum conventions followed, until it could be probably attended to after the Sabbath.According to the late Father Raymond E. Brown, who was a world-renowned Biblical scholar, Joseph did not have time to give Jesus a proper burial, which would include washing the body, anointing it with oil and then clothing and wrapping it. The New Jerusalem Bible I use says Joseph “took the body, wrapped it in a clean shroud.” The problem is of course what is meant by “othonia”, but then it was not that important for the authors of the gospels as the risen Christ and, we must not forget, the Greek they used was not Plato’s Greek.","date":"May 30, 2014 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/25/dissent-of-the-day-ill-say-one-thing-for-jones/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dissent of the day:  I’ll say one thing for Jones"},{"author":"louis","post":"Hi MikeThanks for the comment.

Certainly not, ritual purity was of paramount importance for them, the Pharisees would look like liberals if we are to make comparisons.2) The order to execute Jesus came from the Sanhedrin, however it had to be carried out by the Romans because these prohibited Jews from executing anyone. Actually the court members had the Romans execute Jesus because they were afraid of the people, but we know that they also had others, less important people, stoned to death by mobs.3)We have no other rabbinic sources, but so what? It cannot be taken for granted that what we read in them is absolute truth. Have you consulted Neusner, Schaefer?4) Raymond E. Brown was a highly respected Biblical scholar. Neither him nor me carved any interpretation on stone. I find no difficulty in agreeing with him when it comes to the haste in Jesus’ burial, that is, when it comes to his contention that there was no time to follow all the conventions like washing, anointment with oil, but nothing beyond that.

The gospels tell us that the disciples were in a hurry, that’s all:1) Assuming Joseph of Arimathea was not around, he had to be found and told that Jesus had died2) Joseph had to go to talk to Pontius Pilate and request the body for a decent burial3) Pilate had to send centurions to the crucifixion site, who verified that Jesus had died4) The centurions had to go back to Pilate’s palace5) Relationship between the Jews and Romans was not easy. Pilate had to be careful, if he made a mistake it would be reported to Rome and he would lose his job. He must have questioned Joseph in order to be convinced that he was doing the right thing, perhaps even drawn out some document to defend himself just in case anything went wrong6) Nicodemus had to go to buy a burial shroud, or ask someone to buy it for him. People would be be more worried about getting the animals for blood sacrifice, no one would think about burial shrouds, given that it was the eve of Passover. The population of Jerusalem must have swelled, it would not be that easy to move around, perhaps causing more delay in getting hold of a burial cloth7) Joseph would have then have to go to the crucifxion site with the burial shroud 7) The body would then have to be removed from the cross, wrapped in the burial cloth and taken to the tombSo, philology aside, we can imagine the time it took to remove the body from the cross and lay it in the tomb.","date":"June 4, 2014 at 2:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/25/dissent-of-the-day-ill-say-one-thing-for-jones/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dissent of the day:  I’ll say one thing for Jones"},{"author":"louis","post":"Max, there are too many details which will need time for analysis and reply.

We do not know how much he found out as many of his papers are preserved at the Library of Congress, beyond the reach of researchers:https://www.academia.edu/5565370/Historians_put_Freud_on_the_couchIf it is Jesus we see on the Shroud as a  burial cloth then it is likely to be a supranormal phenomenon (resurrection). The Courtauld-trained agnostic art historian Thomas de Wesselow in fact thinks that both are one and the same thing: https://www.academia.edu/10819998/Book_Review_The_Sign_by_Thomas_de_WesselowThe sect that is propounding the belief that Jesus survived the crucifixion and went to India in order to pave the way for the claims of its founder conveniently ignores that the New Testament narratives do not talk about a normal body but a glorious body when it comes to the post-Easter appearances. Caravaggio got the point and painted two faces of Jesus in his “Supper at Emmaus”.","date":"September 6, 2015 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/04/editorial-in-thermochimica-acta-by-bella-garlaschelli-and-samperi-on-rogers-2005-article/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Editorial in Thermochimica Acta by Bella, Garlaschelli and Samperi on Rogers’ 2005 Article"},{"author":"louis","post":"Daveb, Professors Gonella and Chagas did not believe in the authenticity of the Shroud and neither did Cardinal Ballestrero, although he changed his mind after 1988, giving the impression that he had been led into a trap.

What they say turns Jesus into a liar and trickster, telling people that he would be resurrected on the third day and then quietly went to Kashmir.The rationale behind the talk is said to be to generate bonds of faith. Really? Why have there been no approaches to synagogues, particularly messianic synagogues, which have been growing in the US, Hindu temples, Sikh gurdwaras,Dawoodi Bohra,Khoja and Ismaili  mosques, and so on? Most of these places will have no nasty things to say about Jesus.As far as I know the convention had also to do with the sect’s missionary activity, where Mark Guscin’s research into the Sudarium of Oviedo would be used to reiterate the claim that Jesus survived the crucifixion. Why did “Shroudies” not question the sect’s belief about Jesus,which has absolutely no historical basis?A convincing explanation is needed.Deep inside the move is an obsession with monotheism, which can be dangerous and cause a lot of harm, as Jan Assmann told us. Freud only concentrated on Moses because of his background, ignoring other approaches:https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds_incomplete_speculation_on_monotheismAs a matter of fact, Hindu cosmology corresponds with what we know about the universe today, which is what Carl Sagan pointed out.

Is that ecumenism? Is that how bonds of faith should be promoted? Is this what “Shroudies” want Rome to see?Further, Dan received a private email that he felt obliged to publish and this was followed by nasty comments including attacks on the Christian faith by a member of the sect.I am sure you’ve read most of the Shroud material and know about what has gone in the realm of Shroud studies, not forgetting the message from the Pontiff that was read out by Bishop Kevin Vann of Fort Worth, Texas during the last Shroud conference in Dallas.What has changed after that? The Church knows that many people want to make sure that they are right in their Christian faith by seeing “proof” that the Shroud is authentic. It does not want that kind of approach.

So there is no point in fuming and fretting. All Christians have to live by faith, not by material supports, which can serve as props for faith depending on whether one believes in them or not. So,basically, we have to believe what is in the New Testament:“Jesus said to him: You believe because you can see me. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe”.John 20:29, from the New Jerusalem Bible (editor: Dom Henry Wansbrough, OSB), which is the version I use.I do think that the Shroud is authentic and that the 1988 results may have been skewed.

We also dwelt on the attitude of Professor Luigi Gonella, however de Brienne, although disagreeing with his position, refused to attack him because he found him to be a very friendly man.    It is not surprising that Professor Gonella was defending his position as late as 2000. Did he have any choice? Perhaps it had something to with face-saving, given that he trampled on the well-researched protocols of Professor Carlos Chagas, far more qualified than him, and we do not know what went on behind the scenes for him to get his way in 1988. It is doubtful that he needed any “nihil obstat” from “someone higher up in Turin”. The relic is not a part of the “depositum fidei”.

For more, have a look at what New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan told ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos today, expressing opinions that were voiced more than a decade ago by the late Cardinal George Basil Hume, Archbishop of Westminster.It has also been good to read that collinsberry is being taken seriously when he objects to personal attacks,character assassination and dogmatic statements expressed arrogantly, which are not at all conducive to good discussions.","date":"March 31, 2013 at 12:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/res-ipsa-loquitur-the-facts-speak-for-themselves/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Res ipsa loquitur:  The facts speak for themselves."},{"author":"louis","post":"Not even a thinker as deep as Pope John Paul II believed that the Shroud could offer a counter thrust.

That the Resurrection was a less historical event, in terms of the number of people who saw the risen Jesus. But how did these people see the risen Jesus?

I have also defended myself when some commenters have hurled insults at me, trying to get me out of the blog either by poking fun at me or by making little of what I write, even using foul language in the process. As far as I know, none of them have published anything in a magazine or a daily.I am not here to flatter anyone in order to gain support from other commenters or to resort to tactics like pitting one commenter against another. On the contrary, I try to help by posting a link to a bit of news or some article that commenters will find useful.","date":"November 24, 2015 at 6:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/22/three-questions-about-the-reweaving-hypothesis/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Three Questions About The Reweaving Hypothesis"},{"author":"louis","post":"Sampath, a few days ago you defended the “earthquake theory”, remember?

It is a sequence, which will enable you to grasp the approach that is taken. Needless to say, it will be modified as time goes by, because we learn about developments in science and religion almost every,single day.I can say something about a few points you have mentioned in your comment. We are indeed in the “shadows”, however there is a clash between Buddha because Buddhism is a negative soteriology and Jesus, linked to the Judaeo-Christian tradition, which does not say the same thing. Actually, in Buddhism some concepts are very vague and, in the end, there is “nothing”. Science tells us that nothing comes from nothing and nothing goes to nothing. Viewed from that angle, the Judaeo-Christian tradition is more convincing.So if there is “something”, What is it? Read the introduction:https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJNote that Stephen Hawking keeps on changing his mind. He is a very good scientist, but I have the feeling he is also influenced by biology and this is a kind of guide to the direction he is taking.If we get back to the “shadows” you mentioned, Who created them? It was a problem that C.G. Jung discussed with his closest friend, the American Dominican monk Father Victor White. Their friendship almost came to an end and, yet, the deep spiritual bond was not broken. Evil, in the Swiss psychiatrist’s view, was God’s “shadow”. Really? And why? He based himself on Genesis:. https://www.academia.edu/7344691/C._G._Jung_Father_Victor_White_and_privatio_boniIt is not that the topic they were discussing was not the object of dispute before them. It was present even in Old Testament times, possibly causing the split between Enochic Judaism and the Essenes:https://www.academia.edu/12734802/Book_Review_Beyond_the_Essene_Hypothesis_The_Parting_of_the_Ways_between_Qumran_and_Enochic_JudaismIn our own days, we are confronted with what happened during the Nazi holocaust, which leads us to the Bible again and to questions that remain unanswered:  https://www.academia.edu/12823419/Book_Review_Jesus_and_Yahveh_the_names_divineIf you read what is in the first link you will notice that some things are not compatible with what we learn from biblical archaeology today.

So, if you have read what is in the link above you are bound to ask, If archaeology cannot give the final verdict and the Bible narratives include some Near Eastern myths where does that get us? Do we (that is, those of us who are Christians) have to become like Heidegger, or, better, like Wittgenstein, and think about becoming monks?:  https://www.academia.edu/6085481/Why_was_Wittgensteins_burial_attended_by_a_religious_ceremonyOr do we have to toss what we learn from archaeology and Bible aside as unconvincing, leading to blind alleys, and become atheists like Freud?:https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds_incomplete_speculation_on_monotheismIn my view, none of this needed, we have to wait for more developments in science and religion and both have to be put together:https://www.academia.edu/14727603/Why_Stephen_Jay_Gould_proposed_the_principle_of_Non-overlapping_MagisteriaJust too many links had to be posted here, but it was necessary in order to drive my point home.

It is important to note, however, that the Jesus movement, to become the Church later, was a “Resurrection movement”, not an “Empty tomb” movement.

Even if the Church does agree — with Oxford employing a thorough cleaning process — and no first century date is obtained this will only give rise to more theories, which the laboratory will not accept.

Jumper to Speak on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"louis","post":"Really, Barrie, I mean what I say and I will tell you why;Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti is a theologian, not a biblical scholar. In his position he could only be courteous, it was part of public relations, nothing more, and he would do the same if some “Jagadguru” of a Hindu sect had gone to see the Shroud.It is correct that I never Fathers Otterbein and Rinaldi personally, but it doesn’t seem that it makes a big difference. So what is this talk about “sincere dialogue” they would accept? I make it a point to read what is being said, and from what I was given to understand there were to be two other sessions in Hampshire after the “Shroud talk”, one dwelling on Mark Guscin’s work on the Sudarium and the other on “Jesus in India”. Would the good fathers call this “sincere dialogue”? Can you show me any document to substantiate your claim?Did you notice that there was a board at Hampshire saying “The Holy Shroud”. How can it be called the “Holy Shroud” in a convention held by a sect that believes that Jesus survived the crucifixion and went to India? That would make Jesus the biggest liar, trickster or expert magician in history and the relic would have to be preserved not in Turin but in some Museum of magic and there are several of these in the world.My article has been online for a number of years and I presume you have not read it. I received an e-mail from an important person investigating the Shroud officially, and whose name I cannot reveal, telling me that it laid the Kashmir tomb theory to rest:.  https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The_Quest_for_Jesus_in_Shroud_researchIn this article there is mention of a Russian man who believed Jesus had been to India, apparently indulging in make believe because of his private agenda. It is on some of this man’s research that Holger Kersten based his book. I am only mentioning Kersten here because you mentioned him during the Q/A at the end of your talk in Hampshire. Was it necessary to mention him? Wasn’t that a sign of encouragement for the sect that is claiming that Jesus is buried in India?I have to go go further on this point and ask: would you do the same thing when lecturing on the Shroud in the Catholic and Protestant churches in the USA?If it is your interest in promoting “sincere dialogue” there are other Muslim sects about which you may not be aware. One of them believes that Jesus was indeed crucified and died on the cross:http://ismailignosis.com/2013/03/29/the-crucifixion-in-shia-ismaili-islam/I am obliged to go further and say that obsession with monotheism can be dangerous. You must be reading the news. Einstein wrote against it, but for different reasons. And what was that? He was a scientist, and was influenced by Spinoza. I prefer to subscribe to Descartes’ view until there is real evidence that can prove he was wrong. I have a very learned Orthodox Jewish friend and we sometimes discuss world events and the Bible over coffee. He once asked me why Christians could not view Jesus as Jews viewed Moses. He believed in Jesus’ sayings as spiritual. He then told me that he believed that the Koran’s view of God was different from what is written about the deity in both Torah and Tanakh. See how it is? Whose monotheism is correct?In today’s sceptical world, churches are becoming empty in Europe, American youngsters are not that religious, 70% of Israelis are secular. It is due to what RD wrote, and also due to world events. Freud became highly sceptical because of the evil he knew that was coming with the Nazi holocaust:https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds_incomplete_speculation_on_monotheismand the scepticism is even seen in literature:https://www.academia.edu/12823419/Book_Review_Jesus_and_Yahveh_the_names_divineThere is a lot to think when there is time.","date":"September 25, 2015 at 7:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"author":"louis","post":"David, could you please explain further, with reference to the discussion?","date":"September 25, 2015 at 8:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/24/facebook-barrie-schwortz-on-inidanappolis/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Facebook:  Barrie Schwortz on Indianapolis"},{"author":"louis","post":"Further to my previous comment, who got a really special showing in 2010, with the right to swing incense in front of the Shroud, was a Russian Orthodox prelate.

The definition of what existed prior to the Big Bang proposed by the priest-scientist Father Georges Lemaitre is a very difficult point There are scientists who say that there were quantums fluctuating in a vacuum and that is because in science nothing comes from nothing. If there was cosmic chaos, where did it come from? So there is no creatio ex nihilo? Is chaos being converted into order and, if so, why is it taking such a long time? Is it as slow as the evolutionary process? A lot of suffering has gone on, be it due to processes relating to physics or to others relating to biology, that is, in the evolutionary process. And what can be said if both physics and biology are linked more deeply?This is a problem in the Judaeo-Christian context, but it is not so in religions that believe in a cyclic process. In Buddhism the ultimate end is nirvana, which is “nothing”. Who can imagine nothingness? What is the meaning of it all? Is it some kind of joke coming from a cosmic magician? Buddha is said to have dodged questions he could not answer posed to him by followers by telling them that they were wasting time with speculation instead of concentrating on how to get out of the karmic ladder. It is a negative soteriology, with no room for a deity. True Buddhism can only be practiced in a monastery and even that can be difficult. We have had Rupert Murdoch accusing the Dalai Lama of being a shrewd politician, walking around wearing Gucci shoes. Is Richard Gere truly a Buddhist? He can only be believed if he gives away his millions. As Jesus said, “Where is your treasure, there is your heart also.”I take comfort in the fact that Christianity is not the religion of the book, it is the religion of the person, and that person is Jesus.

Any good pro-authenticity scholar can tackle a sceptical viewpoint openly, as it has been done in the book “The Shroud. Fresh light on the 2000-year-old mystery”.As far as I know, the Church has asked scientists to make research on the provenance of the Shroud, but this will take time and you can be sure that there will be advice on which new techniques to choose. However, to be fair again, the previous tests can not be ruled out when the important characteristics they have demonstrated are taken into account. When Jung read Nietzsche, in fact dedicated some time to lecturing on “Zarathustra”, he discovered that the philosopher was very much a Christian — unconsciously. It was not exactly hard to reach this conclusion. Shortly before his death Nietzsche dispatched a letter to the Vatican Secretary of State asking him to look at “the crucified one”, referring to the state of his health. The cynicism did not hide his unconscious and, for some reason or the other, he was given a Lutheran burial. You will wonder why all this is being said,so here is the explanation:Richard Dawkins has been described as a “cultural Christian”, but it is much more than that. He is unconsciously very much an Anglican, so much so that he carries with him all those old (and mostly forgotten) prejudices against the Catholic Church that were once in vogue in the Church of England. He discussed evolution with Archbishop Rowan Rowan Williams, a most noble mind in Christianity today, knowing that the prelate believes in the theory of evolution, although he also believes that man was made in the image of God.Some of Dawkins’ hostility seems to be derived from the fact that the Shroud is in the hands of the Catholic Church, which he hates. (Perhaps he is second only to Cromwell, or third in the line, that is, after Paisley). So there is the problem of a “Catholic” relic in the hands of an institution for which he has only demonstrated hatred. Is he the right person to teach about morality? He is pulling the rug under the people whose faith has sustained them in the face of tremendous difficulties and suffering. Faith among people in such circumstances prompted a “tough hombre” like (US Army) General Creighton Abrams to convert to Catholicism in Vietnam.      The other difficulties are that image information does not fall within his area of expertise, which means that he will necessarily have to rely on what other scientists say and have said. If he could only be like Hawking, who also denies the existence of God, but is a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science —- and demonstrates no hatred.","date":"October 21, 2012 at 3:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/21/on-the-day-of-the-bsts-meeting/","cat":"event","title":"On the Day of the BSTS Meeting"},{"author":"louis","post":"Benedict XVI said “Holy Saturday” because the image shows a dead man and the words “at the same time luminous” could mean in the process of resurrection.

We humans tend to be selfish, we only think about our survival. The rest is a long story that will be dealt with elsewhere, perhaps in a book.But, coming to the question of image formation, Ray Rogers was a good scientist, however  he seems to have been something of a positivist, avoiding the Why lurking behind the How.What followed was oxidation, Maillard reaction and so on.As in the interview below, I again ask: why should it have happened only to the body of Jesus? Was the tomb Joseph of Arimathea arranged for him very hot? Were other Jews buried in air conditioned tombs? What about those 800 Pharisees who were crucified by the (Hasmonean) Jewish king Alexander Janaeus in 86 BC? Can we be sure that their bodies were all thrown into pits or buried in trench graves? Rome had not yet dominated Palestine, so bodies were presumably not left to rot on the cross. Surely the richer Pharisees were buried in tombs, wrapped in shrouds. https://www.academia.edu/11355553/Dr._Paolo_Di_Lazzaro_explains_his_research_on_image_formation_on_the_Shroud_of_Turin","date":"March 29, 2015 at 9:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/27/ray-schneiders-five-part-eight-hour-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"presentation","title":"Ray Schneider’s Five Part Eight Hour Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"louis","post":"A large part of our hope lies in excavations being conducted in Sanliurfa.","date":"June 2, 2014 at 12:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/01/program-and-presenters-for-the-st-louis-shroud-of-turin-conference/","cat":"event","title":"Program and Presenters for the St. Louis Shroud of Turin Conference"},{"author":"louis","post":"I said “assuming that the Shroud did indeed wrap the body of Jesus”.

Note that he does not address me directly, he addresses the readers, betraying his intention to impress them. After all, he is the editor of the BSTS newsletter, where, unfortunately, standards began to fall after Ian Wilson ceased to be the editor. Here we go now:I will not address him directly, because he is asking for this sort of exchange, and it is not my intention to impress anyone.He says he did not dwell on Professor Fanti’s DNA findings because he  does not know enough about them and that sounds strange. He normally makes some research to contest what other commenters are saying on this blog. He is now invited to do some research and contest Professor Fanti here, on this blog.When Hugh has no arguments he becomes desperate and takes the path of redactio ad absurdum. He rejects the argument that Jesus’ healing and curing miracles were instantaneous. “A true miracle worker”, he writes “could make it happen as quickly or slowly as he wished”. Since the context is Jesus I will stick to it.So I will ask Hugh if he believes that Jesus loved to watch people suffering. Did he, when people asked him to perform a miracle, make them wait, say, for half an hour, sipping a glass of wine meanwhile? We must remember that Jesus, unlike John the Baptist, ate and drank well. Hugh should read the NT carefully,or if he is unwilling to do that, ask his parish priest or some biblical scholar within easy reach what is the criteria of the Catholic Church when it comes to miracles. He also says that the Resurrection did not have to be an instantaneous process. Know why he says that? Because he is afraid that Shroud research will point in that direction and it will be a step forward in favour of authenticity and he is anti-authenticity. It will not be something new because it has been dwelt upon before in the USA, and Professor Fanti has gone a bit further, but more is needed, as stressed by me in italics in the interview-article.I would like Hugh to answer a,b,c,d,e above.

All I can say now that is that just a few basic points in the research were mentioned and the rest will indeed have to be addressed shortly. After all, it was an interview, not a peer-reviewed paper. I always keep an open mind, willing to listen to the objections of those who do not believe that the Shroud is authentic. My background is not science, so I have to listen more than say, but at the same time, as one who also writes on the science-theology dialogue, Bible, Biblical Archaeology, Biblical studies, Parapsychology and so on I also prefer to see scientists like Hugh listening to what I have to say when it comes to the Bible and theology.","date":"October 14, 2014 at 9:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/12/just-the-facts-maam/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"\"Just the facts, ma’am.\""},{"author":"louis","post":"I wish Hugh would post his comments in the proper way,avoiding writing “Hmmm’, “wooo” and what not. That is a sign of disrespect. Professor Giulio Fanti has not been discredited, he presented papers in Bari and the rest were read in Saint Louis. The University of Padua does not belong to Ted Turner, it has no money to throw down the drain.Hugh has called himself a “core Catholic” but does not understand miracles, not exactly current discourse among those who consider themselves “enlightened”, but accepted by many Christians and the Church of which he is a member.Anyone who reads the New Testament carefully will notice that the miracles are divided into categories, and so we have healing and curing and nature miracles and so on. Nature miracles — like the feeding of the five thousand — did not have to be instantaneous, only the healing and curing miracles and the last miracle had to be so. In the last miracle Jesus did not wake up and wait for someone to bring him a stretcher. God is not subject to time, we are, or does someone who believes in God also believe that He was created after the big bang?Regarding the book and the paper authored by Professor Fanti, it is the method that is important, the author leaves it to the reader to accept or reject it. The fibres he has in his possession are authentic, that is why Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia wanted them back.If Hugh had read the interview-article carefully he would notice that Professor Fanti is still working on the thirteenth-century patch hypotheses, no paper has been published, so one must wait.Professor Fanti did not say that he identified all the pollen grains listed by Max Frei-Sulzer. The important thing here was to stress, as I did, that Ray Rogers was wrong when he felt that they could not be used in Shroud research. One must remember that Professor Litt never said anything about the state of the grains,he merely questioned the identification of Gundelia tornefortii.Padre Pio is revered in Italy and in many places around the world. Around eight hundred thousand people flocked to see his body when it was exposed and one can be sure that Graham Greene would be in the queue if he were alive. The article mentions what was the English liberal Catholic novelist’s reaction after attending his mass. Greene also carried two “holy pictures” of the priest in his wallet for the rest of his life. Professor Pietro Baraldi is a respected scientist, he teaches Applied Chemistry and Geology at the University of Modena.I knew Hugh would have nothing to say about the Jospice Mattress Imprint, and that is because Professor Fanti’s findings confirm, to a certain extent, my own point of view, written in an article that was published years ago. Hugh prefers to support the view, expressed in England recently, that someone, thinking that Les looked like Clark Gable(?!) painted that imprint. And what was Father Francis O’Leary doing meanwhile? Having a nice English breakfast, complete with coffee, eggs and sausages? No. The good priest, with whom I had some contact, was an intelligent and highly spiritual man. He knew that the imprint was not the work of an artist, in fact no one in the team brought by the BBC, none of the medical practitioners in England, Dr. Philip Calahan and Dr.Frederick Zugibe thought so. The only difference I had with Father O’Leary was that I refused to accept the imprint as a spiritual phenomenon.I would like to see some artist, preferably someone trained in Courtauld, provided with bilirubin or some other body fluid, and asked to paint an imprint exactly like what we see on the Jospice Mattress.It is unlikely that good Pope Francis will bother about testing the TS now. He has more important things to worry about and would not like the faithful to carry copies of the Turin Shroud around and preaching, “Look here, Jesus was resurrected’ or “God exists”. He knows that the primitive Christians did not carry any burial cloth to prove what they were saying, although the Jesus movement was a Resurrection Movement, not an Empty tomb movement.There is only one thing Hugh and I have in common in this topic.

I am not taking refuge in anything simply because the rationale behind the feeding of the five thousand is clear in previous comments and so is the question of the blind men. Jesus must have taken a few seconds to increase the intensity of the power that was leaving his body in the first case, in the second one I mentioned why it was so in a previous comment. As I said, there is a lot of subtlety involved when it comes to Jesus, be it the riddles that are the parables and so on. I did not study with Benedictines, but mainly with Jesuits from about about eight countries. In school I learnt from German lay brothers who had fought in the reichswehr or luftwaffe, got fed up of war, pondered about the destruction and hatred and decided to join a religious order. In college I played volleyball every evening, from Monday to Sunday, with Jesuit priests and seminarians, learning a lot about theology from them.

Will they go to another abode, not hell, but the so-called limbo?  The problem with the Noahide laws is that they are not unique, similar teachings can be found in other religions. They were promoted by Maimonides, for whom “Jesus is punished in hell for eternity, being made to sit in a cauldron of boiling excrement”, and Menachem Mendel Schneerson, known for some peculiar teachings, rejected by the open-minded Reformed Jewish synagogue members.","date":"October 14, 2014 at 9:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/12/just-the-facts-maam/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"\"Just the facts, ma’am.\""},{"author":"louis","post":"The comment by Charles on just how much science will ever be able to know is excellent.

They did not buy their Ph.Ds, and more Shroud scientists may contribute with their own research. It seems that Hugh has, also in this instance, not read the interview-article carefully. I used the words “beyond doubt”, in fact italicised them, and this has something to do with experiments and the depth of the image.2) and 3) Here again, Hugh has not read the article carefully. Professor Fanti stated that the fibres, both his and those which were with Ray Rogers, are genuine. I can go further and state that even those with Dr. Leoncio Garza-Valdès were genuine, so much so that Cardinal Giovanni wanted them back in Turin, much in the same way that Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia wants Professor Fanti to return the fibres that are with him.Professor Fanti states in the interview that the samples with Rogers were given to him by the archdiocese of Turin.4) Peer-review does not mean that what is stated is gospel truth. It only means that the paper is worthy of consideration. In any case, academicians have no monopoly on truth.5) No, the Shroud has not yet been reliably dated to the first century.6) Once again — for God’s sake! — Professor Fanti’s words are being distorted. He did not say that all evolutionists are atheists and neither do I think so. The context of his reply has to be read carefully.Pope John Paul II had said that evolution is more than a theory and even the Vatican referred to Père Pierre Teilhard de Chardin around two years ago, when Benedict XVI was the pontiff. I personally do not believe that the Bible was dropped from heaven in King James English. I have said it once and say it again: fundamentalism is dangerous to faith. Why? Because we see examples of fundamentalists, many pastors included, who think that “Everything is true or nothing is true” when it comes to the Bible. When they realise they are wrong, they leave their respective churches and become anti-Christian. Jesus himself was not a fundamentalist when he referred to Scripture! The last line in my article says that to understand Jesus one has to read between the lines. Christians do not have to be scholars like Schnackenburg or Harnack to understand that, it is a question of opening the heart.Jesus uttered one sentence that made such an impact on the Hindus, that it made him inextricable in Hinduism, where he is avatar, God incarnate. Swami Vivekananda, the father of modern Hinduism wrote that “Blessed are the pure in spirit. They shall see God” was enough to understand salvation, doing away with the need for Scripture and prophets. 7) Professor Fanti’s findings have only partially confirmed Max Frei Sulzer’s findings, much more is needed. That will depend on the availability of the rest of the collection, what remains of Frei Sulzer’s tapes and what was vacuumed from the Shroud during the restoration.9) It betrays the unconscious. Do I have to dwell on Freud here?Hugh says, “True, I did not comment on the Jospice Mattress, the Padre Pio handkerchiefs, or the DNA findings. i don’t know enough about them to say anything worthwhile, so I didn’t. So what?”.Here is what I have to say when it comes to these:a) Jospice Mattress: He defended the view, recently expressed in England,that the imprint was the work of an artist — on this blog itself some months ago. What he was trying to say was that both the imprint and the image on the TS are the works of artists. He had no arguments to present because Professor Fanti’s findings came close to what I have always said:https://www.academia.edu/8740927/Professor_Giulio_Fanti_discusses_the_controversies_in_the_realm_of_Shroud_studiesIt is easier to believe in telergy than in ghosts and one does not have to have be like Frederick Myers to understand that. b) Hugh did comment on the Padre Pio handkerchiefs above, although he says he did not. He wrote “wooo”.    c) He also did not comment about Professor Fanti’s DNA findings because they go against his argument that the Shroud is fake.Since he couldn’t find answers to a,b, and c, he writes “So what?” He will not admit defeat.Lastly, his last paragraph is pure redactio ad absurdum, and here is the reason: Why would Jesus have to wait for the disciples to bring the fishes and loaves of bread and then, say, with a gesture, fill the bellies of the 5000 hungry mouths without waiting for them to eat? That would be funny wouldn’t it? They waited for him to preach, so they could wait a little more to eat. A “core Catholic” should know the criteria his Church adopts when declaring what is or is not a miracle. There is no reference to the hungry 5000. I will not indulge in spoon feeding. Hugh apparently doubts that God is not subject to time. That is his viewpoint, but then he should subscribe to Hindu belief, which can be contradictory. He also says that the Resurrection did not have to be an instantaneous process. He apparently says that because he is afraid what Professor Fanti and Dr. di Lazzaro will discover.","date":"October 12, 2014 at 8:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/12/just-the-facts-maam/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"\"Just the facts, ma’am.\""},{"author":"louis","post":"It appears to be something like the hologram claim.","date":"November 8, 2014 at 11:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/another-st-louis-paper-available-the-halo-study/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Another St. Louis Paper Available: The Halo Study"},{"author":"louis","post":"The Orthodox Church would have little hesitation accepting an Image of Edessa – Turin Shroud link.

The knights built their churches with a Round, modeled on Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, probably the site of the Resurrection. Most of the Israeli archaeologists ( also heavyweights like Kloner, Bahat etc.) believe that that is the place where Jesus was buried.

Not even the Muslims in India, much less in Pakistan, believe that. And, as commented previously, the Manoppello veil needs a more close examination, although,of course, as you said, it has no “living eyes”.In the course in Parapsychology I did, we were taught that mysterious phenomena could be divided into:ParanormalExtranormalSupranormalThe first two are human and the third would be a force “from beyond acting in our world”, that is, a supernatural force. The events described in the documented case of the Tilma of Guadalupe therefore appear to correspond to Supranormal phenomena and explain how the “living eyes” were formed.","date":"June 8, 2013 at 9:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/07/the-shroud-of-turin-our-lady-of-guadalupe-tilma/","cat":"event","title":"The Shroud of Turin & Our Lady of Guadalupe Tilma"},{"author":"louis","post":"The saint Padre Pio had both spiritual and psychic abilities, he had forty of the latter.

With your qualifications you are the right person to continue his research and I would be the first one to suggest including you in the team that Turin may form in the near future for another hands-on examination of the relic.Unfortunately so many things have come to a standstill in Shroud research. I have had to postpone delving more deeply into the medieval part of Shroud history, having gathered just half of the material needed and waiting for the other half — it is very time consuming when one has to depend on the availability of documents of the period to read and interpret — to fill the gaps in order to present a convincing picture about the impact of the Shroud on notables during the period.One is forced to change direction for the time being, so there should be more news  — and views — about the image formation process next month.","date":"January 6, 2015 at 6:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Breaking news: One of the oldest images of Jesus found by Spanish archaeologists in Egypt?

We need more information because it was easy to say that the relic was “gifted” or “acquired”, but what exactly happened before that?That is the reason I am pursuing the Knights Templar as the possible owners of the Shroud.

Yet, the Templars had spies in Constantinople.Why did they keep quiet if they possessed the relic?

The other one was sent to the Vatican Secretary of State, without my knowledge, because the topic involved both Church and State and there were people trying to influence a decision that had to be taken in Rome. Whatever the discussions there, the decision they took was in favour of the line I was pursuing.I would not that be that harsh with Daniel Raffard de Brienne. He wrote for the best history magazines in France and was always frank with me. He did not really believe that the Knights Templar possessed the Shroud and it is possible, repeat, possible, that he was thinking about his ancestor Gauthier V de Brienne, who was the Duke of Athens, but it did not influence his views when we were discussing the topic.If we look at it that way, my great-great grandfather, a member of the Portuguese parliament in the 1840s, received the title “young nobleman” and awarded Knight of the “Ordem Militar de Cristo”, the Order of Christ — to which greats like Vasco da Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, Pedro Álvares Cabral belonged — by the King of Portugal. The Knights Templar were reconstituted in Portugal, becoming the Knights of Christ. That was what the Portuguese King Diniz insisted on when he took the matter to Pope John XXI.It does not in any way influence my decision to research the Templar hypothesis. I agree with Ian Wilson that the the historical group “fits the requirements with uncanny precision.”The Image of Edessa/Shroud was stolen during the Fourth Crusade, in 1204:   https://www.academia.edu/7447446/Was_there_a_link_between_the_Knights_Templar_and_the_Turin_Shroud_An_interview_with_Dr._Barbara_FraleIt was the Order of Knights Templar, not the Hospitalers, who guarded the relics and the Templars had heavily guarded monastery-fortresses.

He was still President of CIELT then and the organisation’s newsletter was still being published, in fact he mentioned my interview with Father Pfeiffer, on the Manoppello veil and the Shroud, in one of the issues.I have no copy of the “Dictionnaire”, only a book he wrote about the theory of evolution and two booklets, based on his highly conservative way of thinking. Sometimes people are afraid of what they tell journalists and, consequently, of what may be published, so I suppose that objections to the ancestor theory had already been raised, and he may have thought it wise to keep quiet about it.I, for one, have always kept confidential whatever information is given to me, publishing only that for which permission has been given in order to not put people into trouble.As you may have seen, it is precisely what you call an “open question” that I am dwelling on, the reason for a small piece on the Knights Templar that is being written, going just a small step further than what Ian Wilson has published.The mercenaries I referred to were the French and Italians on the payroll of the Doge of Venice, obviously not the Templars.

The early Christians faced lions, could heal and cure (admitted even by their enemies), lived a community life admired by non-Christians and so on, but surely not because of a burial cloth. You can bet on it: If it was a burial cloth, that would be clearly stated in the gospels, where as I said, it receives a little more than a passing mention.There is another problem.The Western world is becoming increasingly sceptical, but it is not the Shroud that will take them back to church, the Shroud will not provide solutions to all their doubts, much more is needed.","date":"February 11, 2014 at 2:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Annette, I left a response for you in # 98, however these Quotes and Replies are not working as they should and you may not have noticed it.","date":"February 11, 2014 at 1:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Hi Annette, Paul was thought to be mad because ” too much learning had made him mad.” It seems that his learning enabled him to distinguish Greek myth from Christian faith, and of course his very Jewish unconscious helped.

It could be that there are many people who ponder on the Shroud and think it bolsters faith in the Resurrection. I stick to the Church’s point of view, it can be a prop, and it is certainly not a foundation for faith. Jesus said, “When the Son of Man returns, will he find faith?”… You see?

He “saw” Jesus on the road to Damascus, actually saw a very bright light and heard a voice,and that episode left him blind for a while, so he had no need for any burial cloth. Notice that if you read the Gospels, the burial shroud is only given passing mention, it was just the ignition, and the Jesus movement went forward with the appearances.I used to think that Msgr. John P. Meier was a sort of liberal, but he proved to be conservative at times, and Father Joseph Fitzmyer was more liberal in interpretation but conservative in certain topics, and considered to have “impeccable critical credentials.” Father Jean Carmignac detected expressions in the Gospels that could make more sense in hebrew, so there may have been gospel manuscripts in this language that may have been destroyed during the persecution (remember, Paul was even flogged) and so only the oral tradition was maintained.Msgr.Meier is of the opinion that Jesus’ divinity was recognised before the Easter event, but that is not what Fr. Fitzmyer thinks. He stresses that the Resurrection is the central belief of Christianity and it was this event that led to the change in name, that is, from Jesus of Nazareth to Jesus Christ…. and he was of course not referring to the Shroud.:    https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJ","date":"February 11, 2014 at 9:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Thanks Ron, some sense of humour is also needed, it is “in”, what should also be “out” is the use of four-letter words – which makes it necessary to delete comments.","date":"September 14, 2013 at 3:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/14/intellectual-dishonesty-in-shroud-of-turin-research/","cat":"history","title":"Intellectual Dishonesty in Shroud of Turin Research"},{"author":"louis","post":"This is a good approach and will help to improve the blog, but it should go hand in hand with the prohibition of personal attacks and mean insinuations.

They were therefore duly answered but that was not the case when it came to Jesus. One reply was not at all convincing, it was simply no reply.  When it comes to Biblical studies, we, in the 21st century, have no pipeline to Jesus apart from the New Testament and the christologies, which are normative of Christian faith. The bodily resurrection of Jesus is a basic part of the NT kerygmatic proclamation and a fundamental affirmation of Christian faith. When J.D.Crossan rejects this, there is no reason why he should be included among Catholic biblical scholars, even though he is said to have “faith”.

However, to continue the argument, let us take Mark 15:40, “Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses, and Salome”, where he refers to the mother of the person hanging on the cross. Why didn’t he say “his mother” or “the mother of Jesus”? We can go on and on, but in circles, if only NT data is cited. As Father Raymond E. Brown wisely noted, “the scientifically controllable biblical evidence leaves the question of the historicity of the virginal conception an unresolved problem”, but also acknowledged that the long-standing (RC) tradition about the perpetual virginity supplies an answer to that part of the question.The “Lexicon für Theologie und Kirche” – H.Denzinger and A. Schonmetzer, used in the Catholic Church, says (in DS 44,46) that interpreters recall the long tradition about Mary as “Aeiparthenos” or “semper virgo” and prefer to understand the “brothers and sisters” in the broader sense. That is also the argument used by Dr. Matthew Levering. What he said was that the early Church Fathers, after analysing the entiretry of the biblical witness, concluded both that the NT offered no proof that Mary was the mother of the brothers and sisters of Jesus and that the living Mary discovered through ecclesial contemplation of the biblical texts had no child other than Jesus.It was a response to the “burden of proof” that many demand. One of those who demanded such a thing was Ben Witherington, who leaped with joy when the discovery of the James ossuary (provenance unknown) was announced to the world because for him it was an occasion for the Catholic Church to “revisit” the Virgin Birth. The ossuary was returned to its owner, with the government’s verdict intact, that is, the second part of the inscription “akhui d’Yeshua”, “brother of Jesus” is a forgery. That did not deter Witherington. The occasion for him to revisit his claim only arose when the James ossuary was said to have been in the Talpiot tomb, a totally unfounded claim according to the official reports. But it prompted him to say that James was buried elsewhere!It is a problem when scholars coming from a background that has no apostolic tradition, and therefore loaded with bias, ignore even the early Church fathers.But, above all, you seem to have forgotten (or do not know?) that even Jesus’ enemies did not believe that Joseph was his human father….","date":"December 31, 2013 at 2:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/28/it-continues-james-son-of-joseph-brother-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"It Continues:  James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus"},{"author":"louis","post":"David, it is important to stress that the government returned the James ossuary to Oded Golan but continues to officially maintain that the second part of the inscription, “akhui d’Yeshua”, “brother of Jesus” is a forgery, exactly as I wrote in my article that was published before the IAA report came out. When the police raided Golan’s apartment they found dental drills and it is known that he was in contact with a Coptic Christian antiquarian in Egypt, who did not appear at the trial. Now that is not to say that Golan himself forged the second part of the inscription, it is still not known who did the job.   “Akhui” can mean “brother”, “half brother”, “step brother”, “cousin”, “relative”, even “partner”, in Aramaic, just as “adelphos” “plural “adelphoi”, in Greek, can also be understood as “relative” or “kinsman”, as anyone who reads the Gospel according to Mark will understand. Above all, Jesus, nailed to the cross and sensing that death was approaching, was worried about who would look after his mother. What was “brother” James doing and why was he not around? Why did Jesus have to ask a disciple to look after his mother? Moreover, Mary herself must have thought about her future, making Jesus tell her where to look for help.The Orthodox Jewish community, particularly the ultra-orthodox branch known as the “haredim”, are very strict about burial sites and the government has to obey them. They were the ones who threw stones on Jerusalem District Archaeologist Amos Kloner. Do I need to say that the orthodox norms have to be respected, even though it complicates matters for those in the field of biblical archaeology? Other belief communities like the Shintos in Japan or the Native American Indians, for example, are also careful when it comes to burial sites. It is not so among the Hindus, because of the belief in reincarnation, also involving metempsychosis, and whose dead are cremated and the ashes scattered on large water bodies like rivers or seas.Statistics do help but it is not advisable to place much importance on them. What we can with certainty is that the names on the ossuaries are:Jesus? Son of Joseph( the more respected paleographers and archaeologists agree that the name “Jesus” is by no means certain, therefore the question mark. It is worth noting that this question mark appeared in the original report, decades before the controversy began)MaryMariam (or Mariame) and Mara(it is certainly not “Mary Magdalene”, as written in the two-part article “Jesus was not buried in Talpiot” on the Holy Shroud Guild website, which you found informative). As mentioned in my article, even Professor François Bovon of Harvard distanced himself from the allegations made by Jacobovici, realising that he had been led into a trap. He made it clear that, in his view, Jesus was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre area, as also maintained by Dan Bahat and Amos Kloner, both of them former Jerusalem District Archaeologists.

It was then run on a Shroudie e-mail list from Ohio, also before, repeat, before, the IAA declaration. Years after that a Protestant publisher kindly sent me the book on the topic by Shanks/Witherington to read and comment. I thanked them and sent them a copy of my article and they just kept quiet because they had to. Ben Witherington III, of Asbury Theological Seminary, had said that the Catholic Church had to “revisit” the Virgin Birth in the book on the James ossuary he co-authored. Later, as soon as the Talpiot sensationalism reached the front pages of newspapers across the world he quickly changed his mind and declared, “No, James is buried elsewhere”.The ossuary cracked when it was flown to Toronto. Where was the crack? Exactly between “Jesus son of Joseph” and “brother of James”.

Professor François Bovon was totally unaware of the premise of the programme when he was interviewed, and distanced himself from the Talpiot sensationalism by saying that his interest was not historical but on the level of literary traditions. Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer went further, and although he found Professor Bovon’s paper “Le privilege pascal de Marie-Madeleine” good he also pointed out that in Part III, “Acta Philipi”, “no evidence was given that the Mariamne in that writing was the name of Mary of Magdala.” It is a problem when you use fourth-century literature to claim something about what went on in the first century in Jerusalem.Charles Pellegrino was more cautious than Simcha Jacobovici,but did not seem to have dedicated more time to homework. He consulted Father Mervyn Fernando of Sri Lanka about the Resurrection when this priest is not known for biblical studies, more for theology one could say, having been drawn into this area by the half-Indian, half-Spanish priest Raimundo Panikkar whom he met in the ashram of another priest, the Englishman Dom Bede Griffiths, in the south of India. Why didn’t he consult biblical scholars in the US when there are so  many good ones there?  You are quite right when you say that Jacobovici has not been cautious in his assertions, and that he because he is desperate, even given to clutching at straws, going beyond Jerusalem by providing a link to the Kashmir tomb! So, if Jesus’ remains are not in Jerusalem they are in Kashmir, is it? It seems he had done even less homework than Pellegrino, as you will see in the article:http://holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/the_quest_for_jesus_in_shroud_research.pdf.pdf Unfortunately the myth is being used for political purposes.J.P. Meier, now a monsignor, is a good scholar, but has been challenged by two other well-known Catholic scholars, Luke Timothy Johnson in the US and Father Anthony Kelly in Australia. The Virgin Birth is not part of the earliest tradition, it was part of the developing Christology, but in New Testament times. Father Fitzmyer also sees a problem, which you can see in the interview-article“What do we know about the Bible? An Interview with Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ” on the academia.edu website.But we can can go further because while he does point to the fact that the only ones who touch upon it are Matthew and Luke, he also draws attention to another fact: Paul knows of Jesus’ Davidic descent and stresses Jesus’ birth “from a woman”. He also knows of Jesus’ divine sonship and implies his pre-existence and neither of these details are considered by him to be in conflict with the two other preceding facts.If there were adopted brothers and sisters around Jesus as he hung, nailed to the cross, there would be no worry about who would look after his mother.There should be some news for you about the combination of names after I work on this and other material in March. All I can say now is that people who found this significant at the time of the publication of the Pellegrino/Jacobovici book are now more cautious, distancing themselves from what was claimed by the duo.","date":"December 29, 2013 at 6:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/28/it-continues-james-son-of-joseph-brother-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"It Continues:  James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus"},{"author":"louis","post":"That is likely.

Why did he say this and not “broke the bounds of death”? It can be traced to his previous studies, before his conversion to Catholicism.But, what did matter mean to Jesus? Did he break the bounds of death or did he transcend matter? This is a question that requires lengthy discussion and will be dealt with later in a paper.For the time being, it must be pointed out that the Hindu belief in reincarnation makes taking any material goods for an after-life redundant and it would also be pointless because the dead bodies are cremated. There were other ancient peoples who believed in an after-life and took not only some precious material goods but also slaves and young girls with them, these being buried alive.The concept of resurrection, as primitive Christians interpreted it, based as it was on Jewish belief, was essentially different and the birth of the Jesus movement was a resurrection movement, not an empty tomb movement. The NT leaves no doubt about this.In today’s sceptical world not many theologians believe in literal resurrection and the “Jesus family tomb” story was specifically produced to deny the event. How much of it is true?https://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Parts_I_and_IIexplains the beginning and how the Knights Templar and the Turin Shroud come into the picture – with illustrations.https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_IIIgives a detailed account about the topic from the academic point of view.Is that the end of the story?

I have taken photographs of the clay cups and jars used by the Essenes in Qumran and the Pharisees were liberal when compared to them even when it came to ritual purity. It is believed that these clay bowls and cups were meant for storing soup, even for medicinal purposes, in fact one scholar even thought that there was a pottery — not stone — factory in Qumran.This pottery was found by the French Dominican archaeologist Father Roland de Vaux, Qumran excavator and first editor-in-chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls.   “The legend, yes.

It was exactly in this city that more than a decade ago I could sense what was to come.I went to a bookshop belonging to a big chain bookstore to ask if they had a book about Jesus in history. The young man at the counter looked at me and asked, “Jesus? How do you spell that?”. Knowing the mentality prevailing at that end I said quietly, “J-e-s-u-s”. He had to do his job, so he looked at the computer and said that the book I was looking for was not available. Around the same time I once saw a boy wearing a white t-shirt walking on the road. The words “Jesus died for his sins, not mine.” was printed on it.Well, we are talking about people in general, but this attitude reached the higher, more educated strata in the Western world a long time ago and can now also be felt in the academy and that is what I meant. It is there only in some universities, it seems, but my guess is that it will spread. The younger generation is not that interested in religion.Judaism and Christianity are evolving, times have changed, they have to adapt to developments in science, although science cannot explain everything.

One great New Testament scholar I had occasion to interview twice, once during the launching of his excellent guide “Responses to 101 Questions on the Dead Sea Scrolls” (Paulist Press), was Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ who was judged to be the scholar’s scholar in the United States before his retirement. It was published in a major daily in a different language and I hope to be able to post it soon.From what I could learn from him, biblical interpretation is a very difficult task, and he had also been judged as someone with “impeccable critical credentials”, also having been on the Pontifical Biblical Commission for a while. His opinion was therefore very important. He employed the historical-critical, whose shortcomings were pointed out by Benedict XVI in his book “Jesus of Nazareth”. It does indeed have its problems, although it is better than the “formesgeschichte”, form criticism, developed by German Protestant scholars around Bultmann. Father Fitzmyer’s exegesis was criticised by the biblical scholars at the John Paul the Great Catholic University, San Diego, California, a link to whom was given by me above and cited by Rick. The reason the scholars were critical was that their approach was different from the one adopted by the Jesuit professor. We therefore continue to see different approaches to biblical studies.J.D.Crossan seems to have interpreted the New Testament narratives in an allegorical way, against which Father Fitzmyer warned in the interview:https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJBut he does indeed have some faith, in the broad sense. It is something I have also observed in some practicing Christians, although they do not say it in public. It is very difficult to agree with the Irish-American J.D. Crossan and that is because he has ignored the depth of the post-Easter NT narratives, in keeping with his allegorical interpretation.","date":"January 7, 2015 at 6:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/07/we-also-have-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"We also have the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"louis","post":"i have to agree with Stephen Jones here.

That is because biblical scholars can, consciously or unconsciously, also be influenced by what discoveries in science can tell us.There is also the problem of interpreting what goes on in the world. Freud’s quest went beyond psychoanalysis and some bits of philosophy to speculation on monotheism. I believe that it was not only his view of human nature but also the rise of Hitler that made him write “Moses and Monotheism”: It was like asking why God had the pharaoh defeated to save the Israelites and did not do the same with the German dictator before the damage was done.   https://www.academia.edu/15308857/Freuds_incomplete_speculation_on_monotheismSo, are we to to become deists? Cardinal Avery Dulles made a sort of apologia for Abraham Lincoln by calling him a “Christian deist”. However, natural theology is no solution, on the contrary it can be misleading. It led Richard Swinburne to concentrate on the synoptics and ignore the Gospel according to John, which is the deepest, the most complete of the four gospels.If Freud was a son of the so-called Enlightenment, so was the ex-seminarian Renan, but only to a certain extent:    https://www.academia.edu/14727526/How_Ernest_Renan_was_a_priest_in_his_gutsBiblical studies today are slowly changing direction. It is important to understand that Jesus did not really behave as though he agreed with the messianic expectations during his time, he assumed more than one role. It had nothing to do with the somewhat common belief that a messianic king would throw the Romans out of Palestine, much less with the imaginary eschatological army of the Essenes, with the “Sons of Light” fighting the “Sons of Darkness”.It is not possible to diminish his role as the central figure of history objectively, as that would be trampling on ethics. What exactly that role signifies is still a matter of debate and will have to involve a convincing systematic theology.

Philippe IV had de Molay sent to the stake before Clement could issue a document in their favour, and the pontiff was doing his best to avoid a schism in France.No one could really claim de Molay as someone who disobeyed the pope, denied Christ secretly, and then produced a shroud with his image.

It is possible to understand that as editor of the BSTS newsletter  — also because it would be easy for him because he lives in England — it would be useful for him to hear a talk about the Shroud and also what people there had to say. What I think is not understandable is his distortion of the truth. There was no “ecumenism” there because what was trampled upon was Christian belief and a relic that is considered to be a Christian relic. I do not stand alone in my judgement, I am the only one who is speaking openly.Further, there was also to be a talk where Mark Guscin’s work on the Sudarium of Oviedo would be used to further the sect’s claim that Jesus survived the crucifixion. If Jesus survived the crucifixion and went to India he would be the greatest liar, trickster or expert magician the world has ever known. The relic would not be the “Holy Shroud”, it would have to be sent to one of the places listed in the link below:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_magic_museumsIt was very easy to hold this conference in England, where despite the fact that there is no separation of church and state, HM the Queen, also the head of the Church of England, has no voice and is little more than a rubber stamp. Would such a conference, “ecumenical” according to Hugh, have been held in the US or, say, Serbia of Armenia?  Hugh’s statement, which I quote below, makes no sense at all:“Those who have faith in the Resurrection from the Dead and believe that the Shroud is authentic have no fear that further investigation of the Holy Relic will destroy their faith by revealing that Christ was not dead after all, while those who have faith in the Resurrection and believe that the Shroud is medieval know that establishing that firmly will leave the question open for any religion to interpret in its own way.”I would like to see Hugh signing a petition to Pope Francis or addressing another letter to the Chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He knows very well, although he will not admit it — just as he evades addressing the issues in my previous comment — that what he is justifying would mean that both pontiff and archbishop would lose their jobs overnight and would have to return to Argentina, from where they come, to perhaps dance  tango in order to forget decades of wasted time.","date":"September 19, 2015 at 7:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/16/faint-images-the-case-of-the-shroud-of-arquata/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Faint Images:  The Case of the Shroud of Arquata"},{"author":"louis","post":"Hugh, my faith does not depend on the Shroud’s authentication and what I see is non-Christians delighted with what is being written by some Shroud scholars to further their hidden agendas.There is much indeed that you have not refuted and I invite you to read my previous comments.

You may have read something about the latter in England where even Hindus have taken part, and where they have never said anything against the creation account in the Bible and monotheism, although it goes against their religious beliefs and their cosmology corresponds to some extent with what science tells us today. On the other hand the “ecumenism” which you say you saw in Hampshire is pure fiction, a figment of your imagination. It was openly stated there that Mark Guscin’s work on the Sudarium of Oviedo would be used to promote the view that Jesus survived the crucifixion and I presume Holster Kersten’s “history”, which I refuted:  https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The_Quest_for_Jesus_in_Shroud_researchwas also used because the intention was to promote the “Jesus in India” rubbish, which neither Hindus or Muslims in India and Pakistan believe.It is of course possible for people with very different beliefs to live together in harmony and I count people of very different religious beliefs and agnostics and atheists as my friends.But I do not thing God smiled at what he saw at Jalsa Salana.

Carr, although having his own interpretation, did not contradict what I had proposed. To go a bit further now, telergy can also be invisible, without leaving marks on something material, because the origin lies in the psyche. It is possible that the Gerasene “demoniac” (Gospel according to Mark) possessed this psychic energy and would be considered a paranormal today. His paranormal abilities enabled him to break chains, recognise Jesus’s divinity and the psychic energy (telergy) released by him when he was healed by Jesus was felt by the large herd of pigs who rushed down the steep bank. The Gospel says that the man was left in his “right mind”. The Greek cultural influence in ancient Palestine — Hypnos — personification of sleep, Thanatos, personification of death, and so on — made the people interpret “invisible working”, that is mental problems, as “possession”. It makes sense to believe that Jesus healed both those who suffered from physical and mental diseases.

One of them said that he had gone to talk about God in that part of the planet and had found Him there. The faithful were invited to comment and no one said anything. After mass one of the persons who had accompanied me asked why I did not comment.

I did not wish to trouble good Father Francis O’Leary because he was busy trying to get as many funds as possible for the Jospice, but it was clear that he was convinced about the imprint formation process.

There was lack of objectivity at times, as in the case of one paper he co-authored on evolution, giving the reader to understand that it was some sort of automatic process, with no rationality involved. It is doubtful that even a sceptic as well known as Spinoza(!) would have agreed with such a view.

If you never have experienced anything pungent like formalin or ammonia, it will be difficult to explain that vaporized substances can penetrate a lot of covers. I mentioned those two because they are pungent and one can smell them even with a lot of covers over one’s face, but others can penetrate through different layers as well.That’s why I do not see anything unusual with the possibility of vaporized substances slowly penetrating through the pillow to chemically react with the mattress cover.__________________________________________JesterofThe supernatural explanation was the original hypothesis proposed, but not by the Church, however it was apparently not taken seriously. As you know by now, one paper attributed the phenomenon to bilirubin, another one to something to do with physics, but with spiritualist connotations, while my own paper dwelt on paranormal phenomena, based to a certain extent on the experiments made by Ochorowicz.and other studies.It is easy to understand what you are saying, the only problem being that there is no evidence of vaporized substances emanating from the body (including the head) to form the imprint. Given the report about the events leading to the imprint, including psychological processes, the psychophysical explanation is very likely, and that is the reason why paranormal phenomena have to be considered. If you have read enough of Freud you must have noticed that even he did have interest in psi and wrote an essay on the topic and this appears to have been prompted by personal experience. Many of his files are still not unavailable and there is the possibility that he might have realised that Jung was right up to a certain point but hesitated to admit this on account of his having previously told the Swiss psychologist to stop dabbling in the occult!     Unfortunately parapsychology is often dismissed as humbug, although it is recognised by the UN, and the fact that genuine parapsychological phenomena are spontaneous, and as a result can not be tested in a laboratory, is taken as ammunition by sceptics to poke fun at those who come with well-based propositions. Another mistake has been to confuse Parapsychology with Spiritualism. Parapsychology is neutral.","date":"May 25, 2013 at 9:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/22/struggling-with-naturalist-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Struggling with Naturalist Explanations"},{"author":"louis","post":"As I wrote yesterday, the dislocated shoulder has been on my mind for some years now.

Re #14 Here are the replies to David’s comments:1) “I should be interested to learn if any Crusader leader provided a Pope with inventories of the several relics looted from Constantinople. ” The answer is in the comment itself. Naturally no crusader would provide any Pope with inventories because the relics were looted. Further, who said all those who took part in the Fourth Crusade were crusaders? If one refrains from researching by appealing to wikipedia or other search engines, studying what historians wrote in books, even though that means hours before anything can be posted in reply, it becomes clear that mercenaries were involved and they were financed by the Doge of Venice. If de la Roche had the Shroud, it follows, he, too, was one of the looters, but as he is said to have been a devout Catholic the question that arises is Why did he not inform the Pope? He could have written a “confession” and told the pontiff that his intention was to keep the relic in safe hands. Destruction of documents in France? OK. But there should have been some document in Rome, so then comes the readymade answer that it could have been inside the archives looted by Napoleon?!   2) There were no dogmatic statements on my part.

The Volckringer pattern is another interesting example but appears insufficient because it does not explain the image as a whole, which is what even you almost say in your comment.  What convinces you that the image was produced according to the known laws of nature?Laws of nature are propositions and God does not seem to be bound by things he created for the material universe. The Resurrection, in which you believe, is the prime example.  Both natural and supernatural explanations for the image formation are possible and it is good to remember that Rogers was not dogmatic about what he wrote; he did seem, however, to be keen on avoiding metaphysical possibilities at any cost to suit a worldview.So do think about the reaction atheists, agnostics, or just-non-religious people have had when they saw the Shroud with an open mind.

Their unbelief also led them to a vacuum they could not fill, making Bultmann remain in the Lutheran Church and Heidegger request his parish priest for a Catholic burial.We must remember that the miracle stories were not rejected by Jesus’ enemies, it was in fact the reason why the religious establishment feared and hated him. He was considered to be a threat to the Temple, with its blood sacrifices and exploitation of the poor, and according to Father Raymond Brown, because half of it was a kind of “Central Bank”. That put even the fiercely anti-Roman Jewish rebel group sicarii on the list of the enemies of the Sadducees who controlled the Temple.The best Jewish scholars do not deny Jesus’ miracles.

It does not matter when Spinoza was excommunicated by the synagogue because the community knew what was to come before he wrote his books, after reading ancient literature and rubbing shoulders with Christians who rejected traditional beliefs. He was no fool, he knew what would be the outcome of his views within the community, therefore his burial in a Christian cemetery, although he was neither Jew nor Christian.If Einstein and Spinoza were here with us today and were inclined to pray they would, perhaps, join hands with Lüdemann — to pray to the universe.","date":"September 7, 2013 at 2:19 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/05/thoughts-on-the-thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers"},{"author":"louis","post":"“I believe in the God of Spinoza…”Einstein wrote to the rabbi in New York who wanted to know if he believed in a deity.

Sometimes even top scholars leave their field to proffer opinions on topics on which they are not exactly qualified to comment. If one is an expert in NT (martyrdom, for instance) it does not exactly mean that that is a green school to comment on artefacts in the field of biblical archaeology. Sometimes it can even demonstrate that the scholar is not really that well qualified in his/her field either. Take, for instance:http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/13/is-this-stone-the-clue-to-why-jesus-was-killed.htmlThe best scholars and archaeologists are aware that Jesus was nailed to the cross because he dared to challenge the Sadducees who worked hand in hand with the Romans when it ws convenient to them. When Jesus threatened the existence of the Temple, and consequently the moneybags that the Sadducees had, it was a sign that he had gone beyond the limits in their view. Raymond E. Brown was clear about this point in his classic “The Death of the Messiah”.Actually Jesus was not really tied to any monument, be it Temple or synagogue, as they were not essential to his message, which was purely spiritual. He could therefore preach in the fields, near the sea, on a mount and so on.Jesus did not reveal everything he knew; he spoke in parables which are riddles. Developments in OT archaeology can provide us with clues about why he could be cryptic:  https://www.academia.edu/18994343/The_key_role_of_Biblical_Archaeology_in_Exegesis_An_Interview_with_Professor_Israel_Finkelstein","date":"December 13, 2015 at 8:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/13/watertight-evidence/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Watertight Evidence"},{"author":"louis","post":"Hi ColinWe are not talking about dead ends, research is under way, as Pope John Paul II requested.

I am not writing “extraordinary nonsense”. Read a bit of Freud to understand what I am saying, I am not one to indulge in spoon feeding.Must I point out that, for the third time, you have not read the interview with sufficient attention? He refers to another scientist when talking about the “current scientific paradigm” and it is evident that his hypothesis about image formation requires a surge of energy currently beyond the scope of physics. Yes, as a scientist he knows the limitations. Of course VUV radiation is pure radiation and that is why I, not him, said “radiation-like”. Why? Because I do not believe that radiation had anything to do with the image. Now, it seems that you have not understood why I used that term.If you had also read the introduction carefully, you would notice that reference was made to the Gospel of Mark and the narrative was hooked on to the Shroud’s image formation process. I was talking about a possibility. If the Shroud did indeed wrap the body of Jesus, no amount of scientific study can reach 100% certainty, we humans will be waiting for “current scientfic paradigms” for generations to come. As a note of caution, that is my personal opinion. You will need to understand Jaspers to go further.When it comes to radiation pulses, the response was about what was needed indeed. Ray Rogers was unsuccessful in his experiments and di Lazzaro made some improvements with his method. You must have read that he encountered difficulties initially, so some “calibrations” were needed. It is obvious that he was talking about the know how.A miracle is out of the realm of science.

So Paolo di Lazzaro is being classified as an amateur? How nice,coming as it is from the editor of the BSTS newsletter. I understand that the newsletter has no party line, and that is correct, however it does seem that the Italian scientist’s research is being underestimated. Is’nt it so? It also appears that the responses in the interview have not been read with care, for the second time. Di Lazzaro used the words “current paradigm” with reference to another scientist.Obviously I respect his opinion because he responded as a scientist, not as a biblical scholar or systematic theologian. The part about the New Testament and systematic theology was my opinion in the introduction and I stand by what was stated.I personally believe that “current paradigm” means something, but only to a certain extent. Can science answer all our questions? Only someone indulging in scientism would say that. Science can indeed inform philosophy when it comes to some questions, as Dennett seems to have demonstrated, but he is religion-friendly and knows a lot about Catholicism. There are questions that science simply cannot answer. It is something that even Stephen Hawking seems to admit. How far can “current paradigm” be stretched?Colin: errr… Di Lazzaro never said that it was radiation. If you read my question it says “radiation-like…” and that was prompted because laser was used. From what I can understand, “extreme short pulses” are needed to explain the extreme superficiality of the image on the Shroud. If you can perform an experiment demonstrating such extreme superficiality, not forgetting to take all that is seen on the relic’s image into account, I would love to see it. Di Lazzaro is looking for people who can perform experiments, he never said that his research is the last word on the topic. ———————————–What is coming next, within the next few days, will require the attention of both of you, in the field of science.

I am rejecting it because we simply do not know how the Shroud image was formed. The painting, scorch, photography theories have failed to convince. If Jesus was indeed wrapped in the Shroud pro-authenticity Shroudies will also have a problem in demonstrating what exactly may have happened.

There is no doubt that the Tilma has many mysteries, but whether it was supernaturally produced is difficult to determine at this stage.

Actually Vivekananda, who was very learned, did not find the impersonal God of Hindu philosophy satisfying, he was looking for something concrete and found it in Jesus.He began to translate the “Imitation of Christ” into Bengali, the language spoken in the Indian state of West Bengal and Bangladesh, but was unable to finish it. He took Jesus so seriously that his only possessions were a staff and a small pot to carry water, that is how he travelled all over India, that is how he arrived to lecture in the US – penniless. He remained single throughout his life like a true brahmachari.

If the image was formed in a natural manner, what will it tell us? We know what was done to Jesus. It is in the Gospels. Mahatma Gandhi literally broke into tears the first time he saw a crucifix, when he left London, where he was studying law at the Inner Temple, and went to Rome on holiday and visited the Sistine Chapel. It is doubtful if he knew something about the Shroud.If supernatural agency was involved will it answer all our questions? It doesn’t seem so because science is telling us some things that clash with what is written in the Bible. There are things beyond the purview of the Bible and systematic theologians have not been able to answer questions that have been raised so far. We have to “rethink” what is meant by Monotheism. Is that heresy? No it is’nt. We must remember that Jesus said things that made people who heard him realise that he was presenting himself as someone different from the rest of mankind. He has his own views about God, Moses and Scripture. If the Shroud image was produced by supernatural means it will have to conform to these views.Life in the world is getting to be very uncomfortable, more people are now wondering if God exists and where he can be found.

It is correct to employ both science and religion, but the question that arises is how much can science and religion(in the conventional sense) can tell us?Since there are two approaches in (pro-authenticity) science, one “naturalist” the other “miraculist”, this is what we must ask:Naturalist: Why would only Jesus leave his image on the Shroud by natural means if many like him were executed and buried as criminals by the Romans? Not all bodies were left on the cross to be devoured by wild dogs. Was Jesus not entitled to an air-conditioned tomb?Miraculist: “Hundreds of thousands in degrees Celsius lasting for a few hundredths of a second”. One wonders if any measurement is indeed possible.Taken from:https://www.academia.edu/8841978/Professor_Giulio_Fanti_discusses_the_controversies_in_the_realm_of_Shroud_studieswhere the differences between the “naturalist” and “miraculist” points of view can be read.I now quote John Klotz:“If indeed the Shroud is Christ’s and, if science is deciphering its revelation, what is it telling us?”It is a very important question, one gives that gives rise to another query: How much can science decipher and just how much (conventional) religion can interpret?It is known that the Resurrection has no analogy in human history, in fact it is said to have uniqueness par excellence.I now quote the (Reformed) Protestant theologian Jürgen Moltmann:“The raising of Christ involves not the category of the accidentally new, but the expectational category of the eschatologically new. The eschatologically new event of the resurrection of Christ, however, proves to be a novum ultimum both as against the similarity in ever-recurring reality and also against the comparative dissimilarity of new possibilities emerging in history.”We have not got to the Jesus behind the text.

While Anglicans may have some Protestant beliefs they have rituals and doctrines that are very Catholic in style.The Anglican Church is much more interested in meetings with Catholics and Orthodox Christians than with Protestants, precisely because of the apostolic tradition. That is why Westminster Abbey now has many icons and “Virgin Marys”. The Orthodox Churches are also in some way or the other wanting some sort of communion with Rome, holding meetings or even signing agreements, like the one between Pope John II and Mar Dinkha IV of the Assyrian Church of the East, of Iraqi origin.It is obvious that for some people getting rid of old Anglican prejudices against Catholics is difficult and the funny side of the story is that this prejudice is still deeply ingrained in people who are no longer Anglicans or even atheists.

He tossed aside the protocols carefully prepared by Professor Carlos Chagas, president of the PAS.

Later, shortly before he died, the papal custodian Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero gave an interview saying that he was manipulated. Given what I heard from an authority close to the Vatican, there had been a lot of pressure on the Church.It is important to ask,Why all this pressure? Is it to clear the doubts of Christians with weak faith? Or is it to satisfy the desires of anti-Christians? If Rome placed that much importance on a relic that is not an article of Faith Pope John Paul II would have requested Umberto II di Savoia to allow him to place the relic on the High Altar at Saint Peter’s and not preserved at the Royal Chapel in Turin. Archbishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo is no fool, he is a highly-qualified prelate who is also well-informed.

While systematic theology is essential for the science-theology dialogue there does not seem to be much consensus when it comes to theologians, in fact I had to tell one scientist-theologian friend of mine that it looked like they have to imitate the icon artists — who pray for inspiration before painting— before they write something.Regarding the quotation form Elaine Pagels, it is something one could expect since she had no choice but to say some things like that.

In 1988 the Carmelite Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero is said to have been influenced by his religious order’s scepticism regarding “material supports” and there is some support for that point of view in the photograph where he appeared leaning over the Shroud. As everyone in the realm of Shroud studies knows, that led to disastrous consequences  —- some say Professor Luigi Gonella was also sceptical —- and Ballestrero later admitted that he had been manipulated.Whatever the case, the Volto Santo Church in Italy designed by architect Mario Botta (seen on the topboxdesign website) has the Shroud face at the altar. So perhaps the webmaster may have seen this as some justification for the image he posted. And then it is very different, for example, from Caravaggio’s first version (1601) of the “Supper at Emmaus”, with the post-Resurrection clean-shaven Christ, the rationale for this in the Gospel of Mark, chapter 12. His own idea about the appearance of Christ appeared in the second version (1606) of Emmaus.People who don’t know about this are puzzled when they only see the first version. Some years ago, while I was looking at the original in London, a group of very young school children appeared and sat on the floor to look at it and learn something about its history. The first question the teacher asked the kids was why Christ was beardless.The common idea of the bearded first-century Jew Jesus (very unlike the clean-shaven Romans) is kind of stuck in our minds and the webmaster did not have to look around for the best image.","date":"January 20, 2013 at 11:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/19/benedict-xvi-jesus-shows-us-the-face-of-god/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Benedict XVI: Jesus Shows Us the Face of God"},{"author":"louis","post":"Bill Donohue is mixing things up.An op-ed in the “New York Times” demonstrated very clearly why the “Gospel of Judas” says the exact opposite of what the channel/book claimedWhen it comes to the “Gospel of Mary” and other spurious documents, they are being used by scholars who take the feminist approach against what they think is a “male dominated” Catholic Church.

An arrangement was therefore made through Msgr. Stanislau Dziwisz, then the Pope’s secretary. The dying man was brought on a stretcher to the chapel where the  Pope said early morning mass, received Holy Communion(!) and then flew to Jerusalem.

Some of the books published after these meetings can be seen at:   http://www.ignatius.com/Products/LIWO-H/light-of-the-world.aspxNow, we cannot forget that there are mysteries, and the word “mystery” is often employed in Catholic doctrine, even in prayers. That is honesty.For the fundamentalists everything in the Bible is true, if not nothing is true. If something goes wrong, they lose their faith  and become anti-Christian, then go ahead and write books against Christianity. There are some former (fundamentalist) pastors in the US who did this.On the other hand, science is also full of mysteries, there is no point in science trying to take the place of philosophy or religion, although many scientists would love to see that happen.Stephen Hawking is a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and that goes to show his greatness, he knows that he may always have to change his mind, he recognises the mysteries in science That is being honest.As the Anglican priest-scientist John Polkinghorne has said more than once, science has its limits.

I will go further: Even if the relic is “proved” to be authentic, that it does show something about the Resurrection, it will not answer all questions.There is a lot in physics that is theoretical, so the Bing Bang theory proposed by Father Georges Lemaitre, the “Catholic priest” who Roemer refers to, may have to be changed.

His big mistake was to mix science and theology, leading to scientism, so he did not really answer the question he himself had posed, as commented on another thread yesterday.If David Roemer thinks that the TS is not authentic, fine, he is entitled to have that opinion,but then he should not write a paper as though it is about the relic, which it is not, and try to present it at Saint Louis and Bari.Some of the questions he is dwelling on have to be tackled, but not in the context of the Turin Shroud.","date":"July 15, 2014 at 11:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/15/david-roemers-rejected-paper/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"David Roemer’s Rejected Paper"},{"author":"louis","post":"We live in an increasing sceptical Western world.

So the blame for the misunderstanding has to be laid on my shoulders. The Italian physicist, guided by Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti it seems, was able to see that there was no double superficiality on the Shroud. That is clear in the interview. Years before this interview a prominent “Shroudie” did give me the same information, however I kept quiet, thinking about a line Ian Wilson wrote in his book “The 2000-year-old mystery solved” saying that when Professor Giovanni Riggi separated the relic from the backing cloth he saw some stains that looked like an image in the face area.Now the question that arises is: what exactly do we see there? Are they bloodstains or a bit of the face image? Turin says they are bloodstains.You may remember that I wrote an article entitled “Science and religion meet in Shroud research”, which was an interview with Professor Giulio Fanti on the double superficiality and other points in his research. It is no longer online but I am willing to post it again if that is what you wish.I think TSC, which has done some very good work, should be more active in the debate and update its site whenever needed. They are also free to contact me if there is anything they would like me to write on new research.I have always made it a point to be as correct as possible in writing articles and reviews, although unfortunately it seems that some things I have written have deliberately been ignored.

No sides are being taken here, as I respect both Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro and Professor Giulio Fanti.I think Turin could make the microphotographs in its possession available to us as it would put an end to the controversy.Best.","date":"November 19, 2015 at 9:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"louis","post":"How long did this take?","date":"November 20, 2015 at 5:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"author":"louis","post":"The Resurrection will never be scientifically comprehensible.

The quest has affected Jews, particularly after the Nazi Holocaust, and Christians and Jews with discoveries in science. It does not affect — so much — people whose belief in God is vague in the sense that they do not believe in Revelation, as Jews and Christians understand it, their belief is more a philosophy of life than a religion. It also does not affect — so much — people who have a religion/philosophy of life where there is no deity. They are more prepared to take things as they come because they expect nothing like believers in monotheistic religions and are therefore sort of indifferent to developments.That is the reason why churches in the Western world are becoming empty as each day passes by, why less Jews attend synagogues in the US, why the new generations are not tied to beliefs held by their forefathers, being more interested in “electronic friendships” and in building careers.In a way, RD made a strong effect when he went around London in that bus proclaiming that God does not exist, wrote a number of books against belief in a Supreme Being and so forth.But RD has had second thoughts, recently refusing to sign a letter criticising UK Prime Minister David Cameron for calling England a Christian nation. He is intelligent, understanding, perhaps, that there is more room for science-theology dialogue, that he leaped without looking to a certain extent.Whatever new discoveries science can show us, it is bound to affect all believers, whether they believe in monotheism or not, whether they believe in some deity (however vaguely he is defined) or not, whether they believe in no deity, only in some philosophy.The quest for Jesus in Shroud research is interesting to believers and atheists alike, to see who is right and who is wrong. But as I have stressed more than once, even if it is “proved” that the Man of the Shroud is Jesus, that the relic demonstrates the Resurrection in some way or the other, it will still leave questions answered. The Church could not be more correct in not including the relic as an article of faith, in not thinking of adding …”wrapped in the Turin Shroud” to what is said in the Creed.No one has to believe, like Gould, that life on earth began like a big joke, just like an accident. There is more to it, scientists cannot indulge in scientism, there will have to be more science-theology dialogue, to reduce the feeling of emptiness that many may feel if they are not indulging in electronic illusions:https://www.academia.edu/7343768/Viktor_Frankl_and_the_Human_Search_for_Meaning","date":"June 21, 2014 at 9:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/19/hathos-warning/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Hathos Warning"},{"author":"louis","post":"Thanks Max.

Being so, it was inevitable that elements from surrounding cultures crept into the text. Even the great (Protestant) scholar William F. Albright of Johns Hopkins knew about that. The best (Catholic) scholar to consult today is Joseph Blenkinsopp, his essay can found in the “New Jerome Biblical Commentary”, edited by Joseph A. Fitzmyer, Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy. If it depends on Finkelstein (secular Jew), most of it is myth.

We still do not know enough about the mind-body problem. Not everyone sees an all-loving Being of light, which goes to show that whatever people “see” are products of their unconscious. We cannot live in a world of make believe, where it feels nice to think that in the end what is left of us is not eaten by worms or consumed by flames. The topic goes much more deeper than that, it involves all living matter, inanimate matter, the universe as a whole. Cosmology is the biggest challenge.3) There was a tendency to exaggerate in ancient times in the region. It may have been due to an attempt to boost morale after the Babylonian Captivity, but that does not go to say that the authors were lying.4) It it not true that the Shroud has been “scientifically shown to have been made in the Middle Ages”. The C14 dating is controversial, the BM authenticated “Piltdown Man” and the Geological Survey of Israel is known to have authenticated forgeries.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (see no.1637) says that care must be taken to distinguish between demoniacal possession and psychiatric problems. We have the famous case of Anneliese Michel in Germany, who died during exorcisms, and the clergymen involved had problems with the law. It led to a book on the topic of evil, one of whose authors was Cardinal Walter Kasper, then archbishop of Stuttgart-Rottenburg.Some years ago I read a full-page newspaper report on the topic of the devil and exorcism, where Orthodox Jews, a reform rabbi and a Catholic priest gave their opinions. The orthodox Jews said they performed the exorcism by placing a pigeon’s anus on the navel of the person who was possessed so that the evil entity could leave. They then said that they burnt their fingernails when they were cut. When it came to this part I judged that this belief was derived from the Zoroastrian demonology of ancient Iran, probably during the Babylonian Captivity.(The narrative about the Gerasene demoniac in the Gospel according to Mark ends by saying that the man was sitting in his “right mind” after Jesus cured him. Did the “legion of demons” go into the pigs, or was that the interpretation of the bystanders, influenced by the Graeco-Roman pagan mythology that was in vogue in Palestine after the Romans took over?).The reform rabbi dismissed the belief of the Orthodox Jews, saying that it was not a part of his Reform Synagogue’s theology. The most a rabbi could do, he said, was to pray for the person with the problem to find his “I”. That would take us to Heidegger’s “dasein”.The Catholic priest just said that the Church only believed in one divine being, and that was God, he rejected demonology and exorcisms.Ultimately the topic leads us to the “mysterium iniquitatis”, the mystery of evil, which is an ongoing problem, one that has led fundamentalist pastors to abandon their churches. It appears to have been very controversial in the Old Testament period. The great Jewish scholars Ben Zion Wacholder and Shemaryahu Talmon tried to trace where the problem originated:       https://www.academia.edu/12734802/Book_Review_Beyond_the_Essene_Hypothesis_The_Parting_of_the_Ways_between_Qumran_and_Enochic_JudaismC. G. Jung dwelt on the problem of evil, studying and discussing it with his closest friend, the American dominican friar Father Victor White, who lived in Oxford. They parted ways because of this, the strong Christian spiritual bond being the only link between them:https://www.academia.edu/7344691/C._G._Jung_Father_Victor_White_and_privatio_boniHe was also a “Shroudie” in a way, with a copy of the Turin Shroud face hanging behind a small curtain in his study:https://www.academia.edu/6823292/What_did_Jung_see_in_the_Shroud(Click on http://www.sindone.info on the left)There is also mention of “idolatry” in the report. It does seem that we humans always look for something “palpable” when it comes to the divine. I have seen Muslims incensing photographs of Mecca and Jews kissing the Mezuzah and a photograph on the internet where an orthodox Jew is seen holding a cellphone close to the Wailing Wall so that his friend in Europe who was on the line could recite a prayer. This is also idolatry in a broad sense.So much for “superstition” and “idolatry”…","date":"August 28, 2015 at 11:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/28/is-pope-francis-walking-on-the-mystical-side/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Is Pope Francis Walking On the Mystical Side?"},{"author":"louis","post":"If Gary Habermas has really understood the post-Easter accounts he should know that the disciples did not carry any burial shroud around to spread the Good News.

This was pointed out in a book by one American Protestant scholar. One day or the other fundamentalists will have to confront what the universe shows us, and only those who believe that “everything is true or nothing is true” in the Bible will become agnostics, atheists or even anti-Christian. There are well-known cases. The broad-minded Christians, with a more mature faith, who have read more, at least some lines about what Karl Popper had to say about science, for instance, will know that there is no need to throw faith overboard. Did not the world’s foremost Jesus researcher Monsignor John P. Meier write that many of the things Jesus said are still riddles, that the parables are riddles? He did not say they were meant to  be riddles, but one can be sure that that was precisely Jesus’ intention. The riddles are the key to a deeper faith.

While one was a philosopher, the other was a psychologist who had deep knowledge about many subjects. Jung was head and shoulders above Buber when it came to learning. There would be no misunderstanding or suspicion today, for Buber would have understood why Jung was not on the wrong track in his quest.Jung sought help from the American-born Dominican Father Victor White, a psychologist and theologian at Blackfriars, Oxford, England, and a convert to Catholicism. He was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church but wanted some integration when it came to psychology and theology and Father White, who became his closest friend, could help him.The differences arose as a result of Jung’s “Answer to Job” and closed the door to the possibility of the priest becoming his successor. White may not have understood that Jung must have read Harnack, just as he read Nietzsche.But, despite the rift, the spiritual bond was still there. It is very likely that it was White who gave Jung a copy of the Shroud face, and he hung it behind a small curtain in his study. Was he hiding it? No, he wasn’t. Everyone knew that, whatever some of his writings on psychology, he was a Christian deep inside. Did he find something fascinating about the Shroud face because of some intuition?

What does Jesus’ resurrection mean in Christianity? As the world-renowned New Testament scholar Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer put it, “Even though some biblical interpreters would like to dismiss the idea of a bodily resurrection of Jesus and are skeptical about the empty-tomb tradition, we must emphasize that the bodily resurrection of Jesus to glory is a basic part of the New Testament kerygmatic proclamation and a fundamental affirmation of Christian faith.”Pierre Teilhard de Chardin wisely developed his conception of an Omega point independent of the evolving universe. He thought about the Alpha, then went to the Omega. But what sense does the evolving universe, in between the Alpha and the Omega, make? The question of this evolving universe was tackled by Gould, an atheist, and Polkinghorne, an Anglican priest-scientist, to give just two examples. The former thought it was a joke, the latter that it will be eventually destroyed.Isabel Piczek’s interpretation of the Shroud image makes sense in the context of an evolving universe, with the body of Jesus released from matter, at least no longer subject to it. I would hesitate to talk about “the possibility of the Resurrection”, but would certainly agree that there are signs that the Shroud “is consistent with it.”","date":"April 19, 2014 at 8:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/19/its-called-circumstantial-evidence-anybody-have-a-better-idea/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It’s called circumstantial evidence.

But the unbelief goes beyond that, it can take a sceptic to the Old Testament, where he fill find scepticism in the book of Ecclesiastes.So why blame Gould, when he said that he would be comfortable discussing philosophy with Pope John Paul II, and presented the Vatican with his NOMA? He was being honest, much more open-minded than Pinker or Harris are today.The Vatican is neutral when it comes to the TS, it does not say that it is a “snapshot” of the Resurrection, the canonisation process is for the authorities a much more visible sign of the “survival after death” that some Shroudies seem to be looking for, and confirms in the Church’s view what is called the “communion of saints”.The reasons for Rome’s reluctance to go ahead with fresh carbon dating became clear recently, there will be no bowing to pressure, it has learnt from Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero’s mistakes.Meanwhile scientists and scholars are doing their best to see what more can be discovered, we have St.Louis and Bari.","date":"April 24, 2014 at 12:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/19/its-called-circumstantial-evidence-anybody-have-a-better-idea/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It’s called circumstantial evidence.

It was stated that it is possible that there were Greek gospels before AD 70. The problem with many Christians is that they have developed a complex about the dating of the gospels and try to find “hard evidence” of eye-witness accounts, other texts and so on. Unfortunately Thiede was one of them and 7Q5 remains controversial and cannot be construed as hard evidence of a Greek NT text in the possession of the Essenes. As maintained by some scholars, many Essenes may have become Christians years after the crucifixion, in fact reports say that DNA studies of the Nasrani Christian (originally Jewish-Christians) community in India have demonstrated a link with the “kohanim’, Cohen, or priests, perhaps leading to some link with the Essenes. The Essenes believed that they, and not the Sadducees, the “saduchim”, were the true priests.  As Schweitzer noted, Jesus is “alive” when you read the gospels, the impact is very strong. That is why Jesus is “avatar” in Hinduism, having been recognised as such a divinity by the country’s towering figures like Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi. He is now inextricable in Hinduism and the more daring scholars say he would have been understood if he had been born there. If the search for eye-witness texts, fragments is unnecessary for non-Christians there, why should it be so important for Christian scholars?","date":"January 13, 2013 at 6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/09/jesus-wife-papyrus-update/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Jesus’ Wife Papyrus Update"},{"author":"louis","post":"He went to see the “huge rag” with his head stuffed with all kinds of prejudice.","date":"May 9, 2015 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/09/james-randi-visits-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_sites","title":"James Randi Visits the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"louis","post":"Where is the update here?

Of the two world renowned biblical scholars interviewed by me for a major newspaper some years ago, one rejected his view while the other pointed to the controversy. Thiede did not appreciate the article’s mention of the computer he used to check the compatibility of the letters in the fragment with “hundreds” of ancient Greek texts. What can be said today is this: The controversy is not over. From my point of view Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin’s view that Jesus referred to the Essenes as “Herodians” is roughly correct. They were not obliged to make an oath of loyalty to Herod and their War Manual has some details that show dependence on a Roman military manual. So, if they could use texts coming from the pagan “minim”, Romans, they could also house in their scriptorium texts written by a rival group, the Jewish-Christians, not part of “normative” Judaism like them. Someone in Qumran may have not liked the idea and tore the scroll and only a tiny fragment survived. The problem is that the fragment is in Greek. When was it written? Would the Jewish-Christians write in Greek, before AD 70,the year the Tenth Roman Legion under the command of Vespasian destroyed Qumran on the way to besiege Jerusalem? The interesting study made by Father Jean Carmignac shows the Aramaic/Hebrew background of the New Testament.

If that is not possible contact other Syrian Orthodox churches, but not in Syria because the community members are suffering a lot there right now.

Pinchas Lapide wrote that he cured both physical and mental diseases, while Geza Vermes, who I had occasion to interview, said he was a “healer and exorcist.” Was Jesus an exorcist or did he cure mental disturbances? The WHO has officially stated that the mind and body are one unit, and it is known that 86% of diseases are of psychosomatic origin. How could Jesus only heal the physically sick and leave those with mental disturbances aside? I learnt of one solution during a course in parapsychology, the clue is in the case of the Gerasene demoniac, but that is a topic for a paper. It can only tackle a part of the discussion because we are still left with the problem of evil, in fact yesterday Australian Cardinal George Pell, now at the Vatican, warned people in England who are endeavouring people to bring ex-Christians back to the faith that it is a problem they will face.Bultmann,the biblical scholar, had dismissed the miracle stories, influenced as he was by Heidegger, the existentialist. He continued to be a Lutheran, and Heidegger, the ex-seminarian who had fought with the Jesuits, returned to Catholicism, not failing to call a priest to his house to make sure he would be given a Catholic burial.  It is important to remember the extrabiblical testimony of Josephus about Jesus as a “worker of wondrous deeds”. So how we can clear doubts about whether to refer to the healing and curing as miracles or mysteries? In the synoptics they are called “deeds of might”, John refers to them as “works, deeds” and even “signs”. “Miracle” is derived from the word “miraculum” in the later Latin theological traditionter. Whatever term one might prefer, all have a Christological aspect.The great difficulty in accepting the miracle tradition is a philosophical one. It arose with the so-called Enlightenment and the prominent spokesman was Hume, who is quoted in the context till today. It is not the answer we are looking for. How can a modern philosophical interpretation of today’s world be an answer to an historical question?      I had been to Fatima years ago. Sister Lucia 1917 revelations turned out to be correct, the best example being the end of communism in the USSR. Her sister Jacinta’s body was found to be incorrupt when taken from the grave in the local cemetery to the basilica.","date":"September 13, 2014 at 6:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/13/mystery-is-never-ever-proof-of-anything/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Mystery is never ever proof of anything"},{"author":"louis","post":"Sorry, I meant God is not bound by the laws of nature.

One problem: he feels that Jesus learnt some form of medicine somewhere, but he did not say where, much less how come this knowledge was lost by the school of medicine. Johns Hopkins must do some research.","date":"September 13, 2014 at 10:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/13/mystery-is-never-ever-proof-of-anything/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Mystery is never ever proof of anything"},{"author":"louis","post":"What did C.

He also never went beyond any limit, as did some authors whose imagination ran wild. Regarding the IAA, I will not hesitate to defend them, not only due to personal experience, but also because they demonstrated a lot more ethics than the people behind the TV documentaries and the books on the so-called “Jesus family tomb” and the “James ossuary”. It is easy to see that they had no dog in the fight, no secret agendas and one must add that the uproar demanded an explanation from real scholarly circles, therefore the second documentary, which was an interview with some top scholars and those who promoted the “Jesus family tomb.” It turned out to be a success because Ted Koppel handled it very well and there was no doubt about who won the debate.One must not forget that, most important of all, to give the sensationalists who promoted the “Jesus family tomb” (Talpiot tomb) credibility also means calling those who wrote the Gospels (read in churches of all Christian denominations) liars who hid the truth, so where does that get us?John P. Meier has on the whole been good, but, as he himself wrote, the “historical Jesus” is not the “real Jesus”, and writing to please Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Agnostics is really not ideal. He should write about what he thinks are correct findings, not to please anyone. As for the shortcomings, they have been demonstrated by Professor Luke Timothy Johnson (USA) and Father Anthony Kelly (Australia).There is absolutely no surety about when the four gospels were written, John only being the more theological among them, and the disciples and primitive Christians came from an oral tradition. It seems clear that Jesus discarded a lot of things from the prevalent culture and would not have hesitated to appoint a woman as a disciple if he wished to do so.","date":"September 27, 2012 at 9:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/26/national-post-quality-punditry-from-across-the-globe/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"National Post: Quality punditry from across the globe"},{"author":"louis","post":"She is mixing things up, and three months before the IAA declared part of the James ossuary inscription to be a forgery this author published an article saying exactly this, even though it meant disagreement with a renowned scholar involved in the issue with whom another important article in the area of biblical studies had been published.

It looks like Professor Watson has assumed the role of Sherlock Holmes in trying to figure out the origin of the papyrus and his efforts are indeed worthwhile, however it is doubtful if the Gospel of Thomas had more to do with it. He seems to have overlooked another possibility, and that is the “style” adopted was the one used to compose the Gospel of Thomas, but the “inspiration” came from the Valentinian school. Thus, it is not difficult to agree with him that the papyrus could date to the fourth century or it is a modern forgery — the intention being the same. As for the obscurity you mention, yes, that does indeed complicate matters, but that is the gnostic trademark. Yet, the mischief-making element also seems strong.As regards the James ossuary, the disagreement mentioned in the previous comment arose because there was no choice but to tell renowned scholars that God gave me good eyesight and even a layman could see that there were two different hands working on the inscription. There were of course other reasons to disagree. Why would Jesus, when nailed to the cross, and sensing that death was approaching,ask a disciple to look after his mother if he had a brother around? Perhaps, today, with the discussion about the papyrus, we can add, And why also if his mother had a daughter-in-law? As far as I know the IAA did not condemn anyone at the trial but continues to maintain that the inscription was partially forged, in fact Dr.Amos Kloner, who was for a while the Jerusalem District Archaeologist, had written a report for the Israeli authorities telling them that the inscription was not genuine.You are right about Karen King’s “proactive feminist agenda” and that is precisely what makes her attitude suspect, and, also leads her to cunningly ignore the words of Jesus on the “eunuchs” and tell Smithsonian that the fragment cast doubt on “the whole Catholic claim of a celibate priesthood based on Jesus’ celibacy.” When it comes to female ordination, I am sure you know that Pope John Paul II said that the disciples chose were all men, and, needless to say, that does not mean he was against women participating in Church activities, but in other roles. If we go deeper into it, we are led to think about why God chose a particular people, with their own, distinctive culture, and at a particular time, to intervene in history.","date":"September 26, 2012 at 9:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/26/national-post-quality-punditry-from-across-the-globe/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"National Post: Quality punditry from across the globe"},{"author":"louis","post":"Since my interview with Professor Giulio Fanti is listed in the December 1, 2014 update I have the following to say:I have not written anything that does not correspond to the truth and, in fact, added a note of caution in the fourth paragraph of the introduction:https://www.academia.edu/8841978/Professor_Giulio_Fanti_discusses_the_controversies_in_the_realm_of_Shroud_studiesIt refers to the dating method developed by Professor Fanti and he himself has said that he leaves it to readers to judge for themselves.

According him he saw the face of Jesus in a dream in 1962, when he was twelve years old, and he was astonished to see that it was the same face he saw on the Shroud in 1975.Having felt and witnessed genuine parapsychological phenomena, I have no reason to doubt what Dr. Svensson wrote.http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/Svensson-refl.pdf","date":"January 20, 2014 at 1:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/20/oh-no-a-mean-and-nasty-smokescreener-and-clever-rationalizationer/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Oh no, a mean and nasty smokescreener and clever rationalizationer"},{"author":"louis","post":"Agreed, Pakeha, given the fact that he is said to have used someone else’s calculations and passed them as his own to write a paper.","date":"October 2, 2013 at 2:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/30/on-dmitry-a-kuznetsov/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"On Dmitry A. Kuznetsov"},{"author":"louis","post":"Agreed, Gian Marco, given what has been published about Kouznetsov in Shroud literature like newsletters, not papers, it would be wise to leave him out of any studies.","date":"October 2, 2013 at 2:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/30/on-dmitry-a-kuznetsov/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"On Dmitry A. Kuznetsov"},{"author":"louis","post":"Kouznetsov is irrelevant to Shroud studies, he was discarded long ago, so why waste time with him?","date":"September 30, 2013 at 10:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/30/on-dmitry-a-kuznetsov/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"On Dmitry A. Kuznetsov"},{"author":"louis","post":"Yannick is mixing things up.

Centuries after the sceptical English philosopher we meet Heidegger and Wittgenstein, with no God in their philosophies, but with the feeling that something is missing well alive and kicking inside them. Heidegger, the son of a sacristan, and an ex-Jesuit seminarian, fought with the Jesuits and stopped going to Church. Towards the end of his life he walked a lot in the forests, thinking as usual, and when in the city, he entered the church he was passing by and blessed himself. Shortly before dying he called a Catholic priest to his house and requested a Catholic burial. History had told him that he was right in his faith, he said.What about Wittgenstein? Born 3/4th Jewish and baptised and raised Catholic he had no room for God in what he wrote in his philosophy, however like Heidegger he knew something more was needed. He spent a year at the Klosterneuberg monastery in his native Austria, sometimes in a hut somewhere in the mountains, always thinking about becoming a monk. Just before dying he asked his “Catholic friends” — philosopher Anscombe among them — to pray for him and they therefore called a priest to his bedside and gave him a Catholic burial.The point is this: Hume, Heidegger, Wittgenstein were interpreting the Bible as generally most Christians do today. Although they knew there was the need to “pound the square peg into the round hole” the German and Austrian philosophers were unable to do it and opted for God in the end, whether led by intuition or not.  Both fundamentalist and allegorical readings of the Bible are wrong. The time is coming, when depending on our interpretation of Scripture, there will be no need to pound the square peg into the round hole. Jesus said…","date":"June 10, 2013 at 9:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/10/pounding-the-square-peg-into-the-round-hole/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Pounding the square peg into the round hole"},{"author":"louis","post":"The above comment is good and demonstrates that Newton, the scientist, anticipated philosophers Heidegger and Wittgenstein.

That is only part of the story, for Einstein looked to Spinoza for metaphysics and did not also go as far as he needed to go because he was one-track minded. Now we have scientists claiming that all that we can know about is the universe, full stop. That was also the mistake made by Hume, Spinoza, Einstein, because, unlike Newton, Heidegger and Wittgenstein they limited their quest and thought they had found everything.","date":"June 11, 2013 at 8:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/10/pounding-the-square-peg-into-the-round-hole/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Pounding the square peg into the round hole"},{"author":"louis","post":"When blogmaster Dan’s friend says “you ponderers”, does it mean he is not given to pondering? If not, then it is high time that he devotes at least some time to it. May I suggest he read at least a bit of Karl Popper?Neither scientists nor clergymen can jump to conclusions. Cardinal William Henry O’Connell of Boston accused Albert Einstein of atheism, after which Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the  Institutional Synagogue in New York tried to defend the scientist and made an even bigger blunder with his interpretation.What did the rabbi do? He sent Einstein a telegram asking him about his belief in God and when told that the deity was “Spinoza’s God” — a deity that even Spinoza could not really define! — the rabbi reached his conclusion.And what was this conclusion? That monotheism could be proved scientifically! Of course, Einstein kept quiet. A personal God and monotheism was never in his mind. Didn’t the rabbi know that in Judaism it is not possible to confuse God and creation?The possibility that consciousness exists everywhere, even in inanimate matter in a way, was hinted at by Nietzsche. Neuroscience has produced remarkable results, that can be called signs, but there is no hard evidence so far. We have the case of neuroscientist James Fallon, who began as a genetic determinist and then changed his mind because of what he discovered in his own brain. Is it biology that tells us the difference between good and evil? There is a lot more research to do.It does not seem that Buddha knew the answer to everything, despite his wisdom, he did leave questions answered. That is why it seemed that those monks who ruled Tibet as a theocracy before China came into the picture were not bothered about emptiness and the nature of the mind. This I learnt while talking to Tibetan refugees who were selling coarse woolen sweaters they made to eat their daily bread outside Tibet. Life was not better for them before China invaded the country, but of course it would be better if Tibetans ruled their own country.

In my view, if Cardinal Ballestrero, as a Carmelite, was wary about relics, Pope John Paul II, also as philosopher, knew that authenticity would leave many questions unanswered.

My father was a doctor, his elder brother got an honorary doctorate in medicine from the very European university where he became a doctor years before. A few years before that he was appointed by both Government and Church to examine the incorrupt body of a Catholic saint and submit a report, which was later published by an European Academy of Science. But this has not influenced me in the least because my father did not have much patience with animals and my uncle did not seem to be a big animal lover. My position is based on study and observation and experience, which would drive anyone to understand that all form of suffering should be reduced to the minimum possible because there is a lot more evil in the world than most people imagine. The most dangerous form of evil is that one which acts silently. For those who are unwilling to accept this, one can say, at least to believing Christians, it is mentioned in the most important Christian prayer: The Lord’s Prayer.As for daveb’s second comment, I beg to differ, halal butchers got their theology from (in my view) unnecessary teachings that crept into the Old Testament. How could the God of Israel be different from the pagan gods if he advocated blood sacrifices? The hated Romans also sacrificed animals, the Seleucid ruler Antiochus Epiphanes slaughtered swine in the Jerusalem Temple to show that he was in charge in Palestine and could desecrate the house of worship. The Prophets seem to have understood, for one of them wrote, “I will have mercy and not sacrifice”.   I have seen a Jewish politician, an extremely respectable person who has done a lot of good, much more good than his gentile colleagues, demanding an end to “Shehitah” (kosher),and some four months ago I saw a TV news report where two groups of Jews, Orthodox and Reform, were arguing on the streets and the issue was blood sacrifice. The Reform Jew told the journalist present that the chickens the Orthodox were selling for 30 dollars each did not take away anyone’s sins and that the Orthodox were making money out of it.Of course, this view comes from the historical-critical reading of the Bible, a form of study which was accepted even by an important Israeli Jewish scholar like Yehezkel Kauffman.So, it seems that appealing to laboratory animals to study the Shroud image formation is more like an act of desperation, nothing more than a demonstration of weak faith. As I commented more than once here, even if it is “proved” that the Man of the Shroud is Jesus it will still not answer many questions.","date":"February 26, 2014 at 8:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Yannick, it could be Rogers hypothesis versus Fanti et al with other hypotheses proposing a supernatural phenomenon, but as I said there is a long way to go.So Yannick was on a long holiday and that is when his phantom “Anonymous” took over, is it?!","date":"February 23, 2014 at 8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/23/should-ssg-get-involved/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Should SSG Get Involved?"},{"author":"louis","post":"In # 108, daveb unnecessarily brought the halal butchers in NZ into the discussion about using animals in Shroud research.

You are living in a First World country and do you know how many poor people die in Third World countries and the corpses lie for hours on a mattress waiting for the government authorities to do something, given that relatives, if there are any, have no money to arrange anything at all? No imprints have been seen.Not all of them land on tables to be cut open by students studying medicine, some  are even sold for black magic rituals. I can show you something worse: dead bodies of poor people buried less than a foot deep in cemeteries where one has to pay nothing.  You avoid answering the question I have asked you a couple of times and I repeat it again: tell me how the the partial head imprint got to the mattress through the pillow. If you can’t answer it then there is no point our continuing this discussion as that will mean you are proposing something like the bilirubin hypothesis proferred by Dr. Zugibe. Did Father Francis O’Leary swallow that? No he didn’t.As for telergy, it is rare and can be invisible. Do you think Jesus believed that the “demons” he expelled  from the Gerasene madman entered the swine and that is why they fell from the cliff and were drowned?

There have been other people like Pope Francis in history, one was Cardinal John Henry Newman, and the laity and scholars tend to think about his brilliant mind and the important books he wrote, knowing next to nothing about his care for the poor. It seems that in England at least each prelate did some part of the job, Cardinal Henry Edward Manning fought against vivisection and in favour of labourers, and so on. Cardinal Vincent Nichols is well-known for his work in favour of welfare:   http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2014/02/21/cardinal-nichols-will-not-allow-us-to-forget-the-poor-for-this-i-am-profoundly-grateful/The Harley Davidson given to Pope Francis by the motorcycle company was auctioned to raise money to build a shelter for the homeless and another place for them to eat in Rome.The sad part about this issue is that it has taken the example of Pope Francis to bring community feeling into the minds of many of the faithful.

When it comes to Moses things become even more difficult, if we are to rely on the studies of top Egyptologists, biblical archaeologists and biblical scholars.

In the last two decades traditional conceptions of order have been challenged by the scientific discovery that ‘chaos’ permeates the behaviour of natural systems in our cosmos.

One said that only one letter could be identified with some certainty, another, an expert in Greek, rejected any identification with the Markan gospel. At present the majority of scholars hold these kind of views.There are also other questions that are raised in this issue: the Essenes in Qumran were extreme separatists, far away from “mainstream” Judaism, and the Christian conception of God was different. Why would they hide Christian documents? Did Jesus refer to the Essenes as “Herodians”, as Yadin believed? Well, they were not obliged to make an oath of loyalty to Herod, and the “War Scroll”, written in Herodian script, shows dependence on a Roman military manual. On the other hand did Jesus refer to the Essenes when he spoke about eunuchs? It is possible, but no one can say with certainty.       From my point of view, the primitive Christian community was intent on action, and texts were secondary. They were not distributing material like what the Jehovah’s Witnesses or members of “Jews for Jesus” do today. They were preaching, living in closely-knit communities bound by love, sharing possessions. These actions spoke louder than texts, which only appear to have become necessary when the Jesus movement began to spread beyond Palestine.","date":"September 20, 2013 at 1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/19/the-divine-jest-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Divine Jest: The Shroud of Turin (Amended)"},{"author":"louis","post":"This is a closed chapter for me and there is sufficient literature available for those who want to dig up what was said.

I have said it once and I say it again: quite often the left hand and does not know what the right hand is doing in the realm of Shroudies. Why be surprised if petitions sent to the Pope by Shroudies are ignored?It is important to remember that what matters most to Rome is the quest for candidates for canonisation, not relics, and the mystery of incorruption, demonstrating what Jesuit Father Herbert Thurston called the “odour of sanctity”, is still being investigated. The canonisation process leads to thousands of pages and involves non-Catholic scientists, in fact RD was once summoned to play the role of devil’s advocate.","date":"June 18, 2015 at 11:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/17/the-masters-of-comedy-in-piedmont/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Masters of Comedy in Piedmont"},{"author":"louis","post":"The comparison was not at all necessary, and since when is the TS an “apparition”?","date":"June 22, 2013 at 11:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/22/the-phoenix-pareidolia-but-the-most-famous-apparition-of-jesus-is-the-shroud-of-turin-a-piece-of-14th-century-linen/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Phoenix Pareidolia:  But the most famous apparition of Jesus is the Shroud of Turin – a piece of 14th century linen"},{"author":"louis","post":"Benedict was more bold in his approach and in his message, read out by Bishop Kevin Vann of Fort Worth, Texas.

You know you know I am not one to hide my Christian faith but if that is what you call an agenda you lost because this faith does not depend on relics at all. On the other hand, you have demonstrated an anti-Catholic agenda, telling Dan he was quasi-Catholic and questioning Hugh about his religion till he told you he was a “core Catholic”. Well, this is quite common in England, although it is getting better. If Tony Blair didn’t get himself baptised in a Catholic church before he left office it was only because it would be leave him uneasy, as Prime Minister, to appoint bishops of the Church of England.Remember, there is no church-state separation in England. HM Queen Elizabeth needed Benedict XVI to encourage Christians in a country where Anglicanism is falling apart. Catholic and Anglicans always shared chapels in England, and around two weeks ago they began sharing churches.Well, this world we live in is full of biases, if it is not religion, it is race,if it is not race, it is language, if it is not language it has something to do with region and that’s how it is.

As a scientist, he is entitled to say that, but then he will have to reproduce a life size image. That is what Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro asks of anyone who picks up the gauntlet. As a scientist who has been studying the Shroud for thirty years you must also be aware that there are scientists in the realm of Shroud studies who openly claim that the image was produced by a miracle, what Dr. Di Lazzaro avoided saying.It is obvious that National Geographic accepted the Italian scientist’s research, just as I did, and went even further by dwelling on the amount of energy that would be needed to produce an image like the one we see on the Shroud. You can be sure that is because Dr. Di Lazzaro is direct and honest, and can even be blunt-spoken when needed. Unfortunately that has not always been the case whenever I have written about the Shroud, making some Shroudies take me to task for publishing what someone else stated, which they rejected. In this case, the fault has not been mine as I expect to hear the truth, and refuse to be manipulated. If I was deceived then that is something else, what Ian Wilson has referred to as dishonesty in some circles in Shroud studies, while writing as editor of the BSTS newsletter.Unfortunately, many Shroud publications only allowed chummies to publish their articles, even if it was just plain rubbish, making me appeal to other publications. In cases like these I have received support from other Shroudies, particularly those who judged that I was correct. I tend to be careful in what I publish, and have some articles and interviews published after painstaking research preserved in university libraries or in other renowned institutions for reference.  Now, if there are some scientists who openly mix science with religion, there are (or have been) others who did the exact opposite, sweeping any reference to the supernatural, even though it is implicit, under the rug. That is something I will never accept and if there are journalists who are not accurate that is their problem and I would not like to placed in the category they are in. My credibility is such that I am sometimes invited to give talks about the existence of God, or religion in general. I have turned down the requests, suggesting books to be read.I am one who believes that if you really look for the truth you will find it. Just how many are looking for this kind of thing is another story, as Schopenhauer and Pascal pointed out centuries ago.","date":"April 25, 2015 at 6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"author":"louis","post":"Hugh, do you believe that the supernatural is irrational?","date":"April 27, 2015 at 7:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"author":"louis","post":"Hey Angel, you are late, I mentioned this on the blog months ago.

However, I think he would not refer to Apocalypse as that would create panic and the Book of Revelation is a document that is still very controversial. As I told Max on another thread today, it was only included in the Peshita (the Syriac New Testament) at a later date. It is not used in Orthodox Church masses, exception made to the Coptic Church. It has been dated to the second century and demonstrates some gnostic influence.I had occasion to discuss this topic briefly with Fr. J.A. Fitzmyer, in the context of the Essenes and their “eschatological army”, with the “sons of light” fighting the “sons of darkness”. He did not place much importance on the document and our discussion even included bits of humour because of present-day interpretations.Astrophysicist Adam Frank gave a slightly different touch to the question of conscious life, mass extinctions and the destruction of the universe. The problem is that if God is perfect why will he allow his own creation to be destroyed? There is both moral and physical evil. We are very much a part of the physical world that gave birth to us. It is a topic that also involves Hawking and Darwin.On other occasion, while discussing Jesus and the Essenes with Prof. G. Vermes, I noted that, while he had a wonderful sense of humour, he was pessimistic when it came to what we can exactly derive from the Bible. He was accused of being “obsessed with Jesus” in Israel, but he had his own interpretation, wrote a number of books on him, one of which was reviewed by Dr. Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury.Naturally, as a prelate Dr.Williams wrote also from the point of view of faith. Prof. Vermes seemed to have viewed Jesus as providing us with a sort of existential spiritual legacy.Is that enough for us? What is the meaning of it all?Father Hans Küng raised some important doubts about what tradition has brought us, but he has also not brought forth any convincing systematic theology. He has really missed the mark.

As you know, it is not the first time he does it and he continues to do so continuously. He even posted nasty comments on the blog of the highly-qualified Oxford scholar, who left us in disgust, demanding that his name not even be mentioned on this blog. Just a few days ago Max also made some disrespectful comments about Barrie Schwortz, which I regret to say, I would have deleted if I were you, followed by a warning.Max is not a biblical scholar, he is a one-man show who has even directed his attacks against highly respected biblical scholars, as you must have read above. He is writing about the Book of Revelation, which for sure did not even cross Pope Francis’ mind when he issued his encylical. To insist on this kind of material today, ignored by the best biblical scholars, who concentrate on the Gospels and the letters of Paul, the apostle, is an absurdity. The way the book is being interpreted here reminds one of the people who produced the Waco tragedy. A serious interpretation of the book was written by the American scholar Scott Hahn.My bet is that the comments will continue till you put an end to it once and for all by making a stern warning.

That is what I think those who are reading this thread would like to see. There is no point in talking about Herod, Nero and Caligula.I did not read the book by Claude Tresmontant you cited, only some papers about him that gave me an idea about his approach. He was a very serious and highly qualified metaphysician and theologian, but not a heavyweight in exegesis. As I commented earlier, I prefer the historical-critical method, used with other methods if needed, when making a critical study of the Bible. There is no room here for allegory and esoteric interpretations, much less fundamentalism. Biblical studies today have taken a very different direction, the previous quests for Jesus are being questioned and there is even more scepticism. We have to find continuity between Jesus’ teaching and the Gospels in an understanding of human existence. Otherwise biblical studies will be absorbed by Near Eastern studies, the Bible being dismissed as literature of a particular culture during a particular period with no relevance to us today.

Having read the Belgian Jesuit Jacques Dupuis many years ago ( in fact, went for Benediction where he appeared carrying a chalice, not a monstrance) and seen developments such as those proposed by the Swiss priest Hans Küng or by laymen such as the Goan Professor Gavin D’Costa (Department of Theology,University of Bristol, advisor to both Catholic and Anglican Churches in England) the only conclusion that can be reached is that the future lies in the science-theology dialogue.","date":"February 18, 2014 at 11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/17/whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on-in-jerusalem-in-33ad/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whole Lot of Shaking Going On in Jerusalem in 33AD?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Daveb, your summary is well expressed, it is something very easy to agree with and you have also correctly pointed out that the paper can bring serious Shroud research into some disrepute.

The Jesus movement that was to become the Church as we understand it now did not have any written tradition initially, it was probably a strong oral tradition maintained by conviction, healing and curing activity (admitted even by the Talmud). It was an unique community, open to Jew and Gentile, able to impress those who were not members.

The apostle Paul understood many such things clearly and thus began to transform the Jesus movement into the Christian Church.Best.","date":"May 23, 2013 at 8:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"louis","post":"AngelThe account in Genesis can not be taken literally, the Pentateuch is a composite document.Best.","date":"May 21, 2013 at 7:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Angel, re.the comment addressed to Jesterof.

Father Roland de Vaux, who excavated Qumran, found a cemetery for animals, where the flesh was completely removed from the bones before burial. This is still a mystery to be solved. Did the Essenes reject blood sacrifice? It is possible that they did not offer blood sacrifices at the Temple because this magnificent building was rejected by them — and it was in the hands of the Sadducees, the “Saduquim”, with whom they had serious differences. They had a different idea about what the Temple would have to be like, and, who knows, would offer blood sacrifices  if they had their way. After all, they thought that they, and not the Sadducees, were the legitimate priests. Also to be remembered is that the prophets rejected these sacrifices:”I will have mercy and not sacrifice.” It is also possible that the Essenes  had what is called “kapparot” blood sacrifice rituals, in their communities, but there is no proof. They also seem to have been influenced by beliefs in ancient Iran, learnt by the Israelites in general after the Babylonian Captivity, although their dualism was subordinate to Jewish monotheism.  Syncretism was common even then and the Sadducees demonstrated Greek influence. How is it that that there is no mention of the Essenes in the New Testament? Did Jesus know about the Essenes? Yes. How could he NOT have known about them? It has been pointed out that he referred to them as Herodians. Herod favoured them, and they did not have to make an oath of loyalty to him. They were influenced by a military manual, Herod’s manual, which, in turn, was influenced by a Roman military manual. They were preparing for the “final war” between the “Sons of light” (Essenes) and the “Sons of darkness” (The “kittim”, that is, the Romans, and possibly Jews belonging to other groups). This is clearly Iranian influence. The Bible absorbed many of the beliefs in Near Eastern cultures. We can see five different traditions – JEDP, that is Jahvist, Elohist, Deuteronomist and Priestly — making their points in the composition of the the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. To understand what Jesus thought about all this you must first understand why he hovers in the New Testament. That is the key to unlock the mystery.All the best.","date":"May 10, 2013 at 10:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Angel#60Don’t worry about how my name was spelt.

The fundamentalists are not only reared with virulent anti-Catholicism, they also want to take everything in the Bible literally, as though it was dropped from heaven in King James English. The reasoning goes like this: Catholics are not guided by the Bible, but we are, and everything is true or nothing is true. When they realise that they were wrong the sense of frustration is so great that they become atheists and anti-Christian.

The Irish ex-priest John Dominic Crossan —whose book on the historical Jesus I had occasion to review many years ago  — says that Jesus’ dead body was eaten by wild dogs and yet is is counted among the top Catholic scholars. Have you read Professor Luke Timothy Johnson’s “The Real Jesus”? It is a popular book, very easy to understand and he demolishes Crossan, Spong, Thiering (your neighbour!) easily. The three men cited in #4 are all ex-(fundamentalist) pastors.The problem of evil and suffering is indeed a great problem, and most of those who believe in the Bible tend to sweep these topics under the carpet as it seems to be a more practical approach to them. We don’t appear to have any theological solution and this was exactly what caused the rift between two very close friends, C.G.Jung and the (Oxford Blackfriars Dominican) Father Victor White. It is known that Jung was strongly attracted to the Catholic Church — he hung a copy of the Shroud face behind a small curtain in his study — and needed White, was in fact thinking of him as his successor, but in the end the friendship sort of ended because of a misunderstanding. Jung wanted to visit White as he lay dying as a result of injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident in England, but his age and health prevented him from travelling and he asked the local Catholic priest to say a mass for White after his death. It is one of those great tragedies in the history of ideas.Regarding that statement by the Rev. Shafer Parker, he sounds a bit like Pope Francis I, and this,too, is a problem because it sound like a kind of dualism, more to do with Zoroastrian belief. The Lord’s Prayer has “.. but deliver us from evil..”, so that is evidently what every believing Christian should hope for every day, the ultimate omnipotence of God, rather than entertain the idea that Satan is laying down all the rules here.","date":"May 26, 2013 at 5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/26/forced-by-the-evidence-to-jettison-long-held-assumptions-about-catholic-relics/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Forced by the evidence to jettison long-held assumptions about Catholic relics"},{"author":"louis","post":"David, since Crossan was looking for a way to reject the physical resurrection of Jesus the wild dogs were handy for him and he could perhaps thus devote more time to looking for more background like Greco-Roman influence in Palestine or  the Mediterranean region on the whole.You are also right about Thiering, who makes Pagels look like a devout Christian, and it was kind of obvious that in her case it was wild imagination.An editor gave me Wright’s 850-page book on the Resurrection to read last year but there was a lot of writing to do and piles of other books on other topics to read so he had to be kept aside.In my view Professor Vermes was never the best Jesus scholar, that honour has to be reserved for Msgr. J.P.Meier, although Fr. Anthony Kelly (your neighbour again!) has aimed at him. Vermes was sort of obsessed with Jesus and gave his approach a different slant, questioning the rationale behind the birth of Christianity and dismissing important NT accounts like the parable of the Wicked Tenants as an invention of the primitive Church. It was written all over the walls that his writing were mostly agenda-driven. Hopefully more about this and much more important viewpoints, all of it original, should be posted on the Internet shortly.As you said, Job is still an unresolved problem.

Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’29“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’30“‘No, father Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’31“He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”People tend to be practical in life, sweeping under the carpet what is inconvenient, even in Christian societies: http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2015/10/06/syrian-archbishop-criticises-us-for-siding-with-al-qaeda/","date":"October 10, 2015 at 5:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/09/no-closer-to-the-truth-because-of-simony/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"No Closer to the Truth Because of Simony"},{"author":"louis","post":"I think insulting the Church by using the word “simony” only make matters worse.

He was then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The top German intellectual, who taught in universities in his native country for forty years, is, as I wrote, a truth seeker. He did not expect to be Pope, in fact he had asked John Paul II, the pope-philosopher, to be released of his duties as prefect to work in the Vatican library. His request was turned down.The “Tablet” article portrayed Benedict as someone who was perplexed by the fact that Jesus was crucified. In other words, Why did God allow that to happen? When he went to Auschwitz, the pontiff asked, “Where was God?”.Whether we want to face it or not, most people in the world suffer, there is both moral AND physical evil, it is part of the “mysterious iniquitatis”, not even Alvan Plantinga has been able to tackle that. C.G. Jung and his closest friend, the American Dominican Father Victor White, based at Blackfriars, Oxford, reached no conclusion. The friendship almost came to an end. There was a thin but very strong thread that linked them and it was not broken. It was extremely strong. What was it? A spiritual bond. The Swiss psychiatrist told the priest, who lay dying, that he was now wearing Job’s shoes.After Father White’s untimely death, Jung thanked a Mother Superior of a Contemplative Order in England for the “spiritual help” she gave him:https://www.academia.edu/7344691/C._G._Jung_Father_Victor_White_and_privatio_boniHe understood the problem in the deepest sense.

It was going in the wrong direction with some strange comments. So I will post here some comments about two intellectual giants, one of whom knew about the existence of the relic, and their belief in God.C.G. Jung kept a copy of the Shroud face in his study, possibly given to him by his closest friend, the American Dominican scholar Father Victor White, based at Blackfriars, Oxford.He did not keep it there because it was what led to his belief in God. On the contrary, he seems to have viewed it as a kind of consequence of the existence of God in some way.When asked whether he believed in God, he replied that he did not have to believe, he knew.https://www.academia.edu/6823292/What_did_Jung_see_in_the_ShroudLudwig Wittgenstein may not have have known anything about the Shroud, although he did spend some years meditating in a monastery, Klosterneuberg, in Austria. The Austrian-British philosopher was in the words of Bertrand Russell, the most perfect example he had ever known “of genius as traditionally conceived; passionate,intense and dominating.”Wittgenstein felt that his philosophy was leading him nowhere, something was missing. “I cannot help seeing everything from a religious point of view”, he wrote. Was it intuition? Was it something like what Jung sensed? Could be.Psychology (Jung) raises questions that have to be tackled by philosophy (Wittgenstein). How far can philosophy get? Pope John Paul II answered the question in his encyclical “Fides et Ratio” (Faith and Reason”).Heidegger had no room for God in his philosophy, but made arrangements for a Catholic burial before he died. C.G. Jung was given a Protestant burial and Wittgenstein asked his Catholic friends to pray for him before he died:https://www.academia.edu/6085481/Why_was_Wittgensteins_burial_attended_by_a_religious_ceremony","date":"December 7, 2014 at 2:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/06/revisiting-shroud-of-turin-and-physics-of-resurrection/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Revisiting Shroud of Turin and physics of resurrection"},{"author":"louis","post":"Thank you, Hugh.

Crossan into the picture; as I commented a few days ago, if we are to believe what he thinks,there would be no New Testament for him to misinterpret.I received his book on the “historical Jesus” for review more than a decade ago. We learn more about Mediteranean culture than about Jesus. How could a sophisticated and learned Jesus be a “Mediterranean peasant”, as he wants us to believe? It is known from archaeological research that Jews migrated from Judaea to Lower Galilee after the Hasmoneans took over and they owned the land. Some became tenant farmers. Further, as Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer tell us, we have no access to the ” historical Jesus”, only to the “Jesus of history” and Msgr. J.P. Meier makes it clear that even the “real Jesus” is not accessible to us. No wonder that even the liberal Protestant scholar Helmut Koester felt that Jesus research should be laid to rest for another hundred years.J.D.Crossan was in Jerusalem after the so-called Jesus family tomb documentary and accompanying book was launched. Perhaps he went there thinking that he might have been wrong in writing about what happened to Jesus’ body after the crucifixion. Only, he went to the wrong tomb! That was his second mistake. Why?No serious archaeologist or historian, both in and out of Israel, believes that Jesus was not buried in a tomb.https://www.academia.edu/7471287/Book_Review_The_Tomb_of_Jesus_and_His_Family_Exploring_Ancient_Jewish_Tombs_Near_Jerusalems_Walls","date":"July 12, 2015 at 10:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/12/the-meaning-of-solid/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Meaning of Solid"},{"author":"louis","post":"It is doubtful if academics always write gospel truth.

Seewald gave up being a communist and atheist and returned to Catholicism after interviewing Benedict, putting forth forthright questions and after being told by the pontiff not to show the questions in advance.","date":"June 16, 2013 at 11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/16/which-came-first-the-gospels-or-the-shroud/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Which Came First, the Gospels or the Shroud?"},{"author":"louis","post":"Max, There are three things to be considered if the Shroud is proved to be the genuine article:1. If the image just shows the dead Jesus what can it tell us that is really important?2. If it does show the dead Jesus in the process of Resurrection does it answer all our questions?3. As you know, the Church moves slowly, it is in no hurry, and as you yourself agreed with me not long ago it is the risen Jesus, and not any burial cloth, that led to the birth of Christianity, according to the Gospels. Caravaggio understood this very well and therefore his beautiful two versions of the Supper at Emmaus.It is worthwhile sending a petition to Shroud custodian Archbishop Cesare Nosiglia but the question that arises is if the Church will first create a scientific commission for the purpose of studying the photographs you mention.

He has never been dogmatic and has said more than once that a lot more research is needed, therefore the need to read all the books he has published on the topic, not forgetting “Holy Faces, Secret Places”, which is about other images that could be related to the Shroud.We must not forget the mosaic discovered not long ago in Turkey and, yes, there is another gap to fill after 1204, where the Templar connection can help and hopefully some more evidence will surface soon.I have published two interviews with Wilson, one a full-page interview-article in a major daily and a third one, stored in a drawer, is yet to be published. We did have extremely frank discussions, and agreed about everything, which is what prompted me to place a lot of hope in his work. But, unfortunately, there have been problems in Shroud research. In my view, it is wrong to concentrate on making the Shroud known as much as possible, occasionally publishing rubbish in the process. As I said more than once, crucial research inside churches has come to a standstill because the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing in the realm of Shroud studies, particularly in websites and publications, where generally only chummies have had doors opened to them. Of course, it is part of Shroud politics, it is a sort of closed circle, and is that conducive to progress? That apparently is the reason why people blowing their tops with articles criticising the attitudes of prelates on websites, petitions to the Pope and so on have been ignored. The clerics in Turin and Rome are not blindfolded, they do know what is going on.","date":"January 19, 2014 at 10:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"louis","post":"See # 11","date":"January 19, 2014 at 10:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"louis","post":"#11 was addressed to Charles Freeman.","date":"January 19, 2014 at 11:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"louis","post":"Thanks, Charles.

The Church is very careful and very slow when it comes to many matters and relics are secondary, they will not help tackle other, more urgent, issues that have arisen lately.

You can write down what I am saying. Just read what has been posted on Shroud websites and published in Shroud publications and you will understand why.I think Wilson did his best with the sources at his disposal and at least he was the first scholar to establish a link between history, in the form of traditions, legends, some ancient sources, recording Jesus having left his likeness on cloth and the Turin Shroud. At least some of his contentions could have been been verified with help from Rome and if this did not take concrete shape it has been largely due, again, to what has gone on in the realm of Shroud studies.

In my view that has been the case with Walter Kauffman, of Princeton, when it came to Nietzsche. He also had to defend Freud by attacking Adler and Jung, ignoring the fact that while there may have been some contradictions in what Jung wrote many of the Freud files are still not available for scrutiny and these would help in clarifying the many doubts in the battle that is raging in the realm of studies in the field of psychoanalysis.","date":"January 21, 2014 at 10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"louis","post":"The Virgin Birth has nothing to do with Christian fundamentalism, as the author seems to imply.

Take the case of the so-called Jesus Family Tomb, where claims were made contesting papers published in professional journals by professional archaeologists. Many of the claims were based on wild imagination and were agenda-driven and were therefore easily dismissed as sensationalism, meant to fill the coffers of publishing houses and TV channels. The uproar led Ted Koppel to lose no time in face-saving and to hit hard to demonstrate that the company he worked for was serious.

The JEPD theory therefore makes sense and only God knows how much editing was done if the OT, as we know it today, only became “ready” around 500 BC, during the time of Ezra. But was it really ready? Monotheism, as we understand it today, is said to have been defined by the Council of Nicaea. D.N. Freedman’s study about the evolving concept about God in OT times thus becomes very relevant.You are right about the complex question of human consciousness and quantum. There are scholars who believe that the universe is determined, so it follows that we humans with our physical bodies are also determined. That, needless to say, raises the question of the mind-body problem. If the body is determined, what about the mind, which is connected to the brain? We are thus lead to more questions, things like free will and so on.Viktor Frankl, who suffered in Auschwitz, wrote that the question of suffering is related to the question of God.

What I said in # 3 is that neuroscientists have made reasonable progress but have yet to present hard evidence, so one can image how tough it is even for highly qualified professional scientists like the Portuguese-born Professor Antonio Damasio (University of Iowa). What, then, can be said about the links provided? Is this science? No one can present this to serious scientists and not expect to be laughed out of court. There is still a lot to be learnt about the nature of mind, consciousness and the structure of the universe. We know very little about ontological reality and blogs and sites that appear to appeal to the esoteric seem to lead to a world of make believe, a world to make everyone feel nice.Reincarnation is not compatible with a good God, that is why Hinduism has at least some eighty schools of interpretation, with little agreement between them. God can be “He”, “She”, “It”, it can be an endless cycle trying to get out of the karmic ladder, more in keeping with Camus’ Myth of Sisyphus. The contradictions are numerous. It has to be noted that reincarnationists are always talking about karma, about climbing the karmic ladder, but always in the next reincarnation, very rarely in the present one. A clear example?The Indian vice-consul arrested in New York was clearly exploiting the servant she brought from India. Why? Because the servant came from a lower caste, the suffering is her karma, that his her problem. The vice-consul, apparently from a higher caste, was worried about her material comfort, doing little to get out of the wheel of Karma. Why be surprised about what Freud wrote about human nature? Better, Jesus said, “Where is your treasure there is your heart also.”  It happens in Christendom also. Let us take a clear example from there, although the object is a revered figure. Thomas Jefferson was wealthy, with 602 slaves in his backyard and minors working as “trainees” in his nail factory. He had plenty of time to cut the Gospels into pieces, selecting only those passages that were convenient to his lifestyle. With a desktop he would be much more faster, there would be no need for scissors and glue. Cardinal Avery Dulles wrote that he was a “Christian deist”! What sort of apologia was this?There can be no doubt that NHNE’s intentions are very good, but the aims are not relevant to Shroud studies. They can help those whose faith is weak, there are gaps to be filled and these undermine faith. That is because Jesus spoke to us about our lives, he didn’t say anything about the universe that is presented to us. If, as it is said, the universe is indifferent, it can also be stated that Jesus was indifferent to it. You learn that in the Gospels. Jesus demanded absolute faith.","date":"January 12, 2014 at 7:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/12/barrie-schwortz-tedx-talk-featured-on-nde-site/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Barrie Schwortz’ TEDx Talk Featured on NDE Site"},{"author":"louis","post":"The mantra again, updated.

It was the post-Easter appearances in general that were decisive. The problem with de Wesselow is that although his book called attention to the unique image on the TS he did not seem to understand that for the Palestinian Jewish-Christians who formed the Jesus movement resurrection meant bodily resurrection and not the Greek philosophical dichotomy of body/soul. He therefore dismisses many of the Gospel accounts as “fantasies.”There is another problem, and that is with J.P. Meier, whose series will end without the Resurrection because he thinks that that is beyond the scope of the historian. It is like judging what is less historical to be beyond the purview of the historian. So he simply says that “Jesus rose in the fullness of his humanity into the full presence of God.” That is fine for him as a Catholic priest, in fact a monsignor, who believes in the Resurrection, and who also says mass and preaches at a parish in New York.Benedict XVI, whose book “Jesus of Nazareth” has also been appreciated by important Protestant scholars, and is a theologian and no historian, puts it more succinctly: “The Resurrection is not above and beyond history. It points beyond history but has left footprints in history.” Shroud studies will have to determine if the relic is ONE of those footprints.","date":"January 3, 2013 at 5:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England"},{"author":"louis","post":"No one has noticed that there are bloggers who react to other bloggers depending on how yet other bloggers react?","date":"February 8, 2014 at 6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/08/dear-colin-if-you-change-your-mind-you-are-welcome-back/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Dear Colin:  If you change your mind you are welcome back."},{"author":"louis","post":"This, too, was obviously necessary to post, for Berry does not seem to have taken the right approach and, at the rate things are being said, it is unlikely that there will be any change .

Not that he is not right in calling the attention of the faithful to these problems, it is the concentration on this alone that is the problem and there are other serious topics to be addressed. It is because of reasons like these that the South American (Catholic) clergy is now facing the problem of thousands leaving the fold, many of these founding their own “churches”, one in every corner, with “pastors” who have not gone beyond high school, learning the Bible in six months, stressing “theology of prosperity”, tithes, buying imported cars, living in mansions and what not. This was even noticed by Robert Runcie, the head of the Anglican Church, who spoke his mind when he visited the region years ago. The sense of community should have been stronger, replacing the social club mentality prevalent in the parishes.   .   There are indeed weak points in John P. Meier’s approach, as Luke Timothy Johnson pointed out. He received two gold medals for excellence in biblical studies while studying in Rome and is admired and quoted by Benedict XVI. Father Fitzmyer is a better scholar in some ways,but Ratzinger never seemed to like the historical-critical method adoped by him, Fathers Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy. Their “Jerome Biblical Commentary” is an excellent source for any one who wishes to go deeper into biblical studies.As for Rabbi Boteach, he does have some good things to say, and is trying to make Jesus more relevant to Jews, but it does lead to distortions. That was also the case with Geza Vermes.

The “greats” in the field published their papers and took it for granted that what they proffered would be unchallenged. They are now silent. Why? Because only chummies/buddies were allowed to publish what they wanted in newsletters or websites and get away with it and not all those who were writing papers were professionals in the field. The result is that Turin has turned down requests for a a new hands-on examination of the relic.Scepticism is growing as each day passes by and the Judaeo-Christian worldview is becoming unconvincing because of some discoveries in science. The Genesis creation story was borrowed from Mesopotamian mythology, and written between the 7th and 5th centuries BC. Sean Freyne preferred the 5th century.

I only take exception to what should be called not “unconscious”  but “conscious bias” that could be detected in his approach, and that was positivism.– On the other side of the spectrum are those who have been called “miraculists”, included among these is the following interviewee:https://www.academia.edu/8841978/Professor_Giulio_Fanti_discusses_the_controversies_in_the_realm_of_Shroud_studiesIt was a mistake to put this interview on the “black list” in the last shroud.com update simply because it was an interview and not a paper. In the fifth paragraph of the introduction it is clear not only that the reader is invited to judge for himself the responses in the interview but also that what is claimed is being prepared to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. That being so, I am willing to respond to any doubts about the questions asked, the rest will have to wait for peer review. On my part, I can say that I work independently, am not anyone’s spokesman, and there is a lot more to come that will have to wait till 2015.– It has been commented more than once on this blog that only chummies were allowed to publish what they wanted to say  — rubbish or not — in Shroud newsletters and other publications. So why complain if Shroud researchers have to post their articles and papers on other websites, beyond the realm of Shroud studies? Curiously, the same researchers who have their papers on Shroud websites and newsletter also post their material on other sites and why is this so?– As for peer review, Dr. Frederick Zugibe had his paper on the Jospice Mattress Imprint posted on a Shroud website without peer review. I was not given a chance, only when my article on the topic was run on an e-mail list from Ohio. In my article I dwelt on the partial head image that Dr. Zugibe failed to tackle. Why? It was convenient for him, he was proposing bilirubin. Father Francis 0’Leary had emphasized this head image.  – Lastly, I have noted that there there is a cult-like devotion to Ray Rogers in some Shroud circles as though what he wrote is gospel truth. That has to be rejected in view of the positivism I detected in his approach. It is not that I am in favour of the “miraculists”, but I do believe that if the Shroud did indeed wrap the body of Jesus then the image is there for a purpose. Why should only Jesus’ body have been lying like bread baking in an oven, waiting for a Maillard effect or some other process? Were other bodies lying in air-conditioned tombs?The answer to this question will be sought in the article to be published in the beginning of next year.","date":"December 10, 2014 at 9:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/10/remembering-ray-rogers-at-the-st-louis-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Remembering Ray Rogers at the St. Louis Conference"},{"author":"louis","post":"You’re welcome, Uriel.

It would be wrong to confuse this field with Spiritualism, although, unfortunately this  appears to have been done in some cases by London’s SPR. C.G. Jung was a co-founder of the Society, had dabbled in the occult through the influence of relatives and it was mod during the period. He then gave it up and moved to other areas. See my article “What did Jung see in the Shroud?” on the Collegamento pro-Sindone website.Piero has attributed the imprint to something to do with the mattress dye. Does it explain how the partial head image got to the mattress? No, it doesn’t and the same can be said about bilirubin. :https://www.academia.edu/4691379/Can_the_Jospice_Mattress_imprint_be_compared_to_the_Image_on_the_ShroudIn First World countries the undertaker is called when a person dies and the work is quick. That is not so in many Third World countries, where the body of a poor man can lie for hours on a mattress on a stretcher waiting for relatives, if any, who can give a decent burial. Sometimes the body lands on the tables of students of medicine. I have seen bodies being offered for black magic rituals. That is the world we live in. Anyway, the point is that no imprints have been seen in these cases.It has also been said in England that it is the work of an artist. I have chosen to ignore this view because the interview-article, the link to which is given above, has the scientist saying that it was a Kirlian process. That is closer to the telergy I proposed. Once again, the partial head image — emphasised by good Father Francis O’Leary, with whom I had some contact — is ignored in the case proposing an artist’s image.  I can’t say with certainty if all STURP members knew/know about the imprint. Most of them probably did/do because it was Ian Wilson who brought the topic into the debate on the Shroud. When I asked him whether he believed that it was the same process that formed the Shroud image and the Mattress imprint the response was negative. That meant we were talking the same language and it was good.","date":"December 10, 2014 at 3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/10/remembering-ray-rogers-at-the-st-louis-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Remembering Ray Rogers at the St. Louis Conference"},{"author":"louis","post":"Dawkins appears to have changed his mind lately and was reported to have begun entertaining the possibility of the existence of God.

It is obvious, then, that he viewed history as the interpretation of events and not as collective karma. Collective karma could have meant that “God is an illusion”, which would take him back to his philosophy, and the rationale would be circular. The latter had a religious sixth sense throughout his life, whatever he wrote on philosophy, and, fearing judgment, asked his “Catholic friends” to pray for him as he prepared to depart from this world:     https://www.academia.edu/6085481/Why_was_Wittgensteins_burial_attended_by_a_religious_ceremony","date":"April 27, 2014 at 6:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/25/some-advice-from-stephen-jones/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Some Advice from Stephen Jones"},{"author":"louis","post":"Agreed 100%, daveb.

It is not all difficult to understand this if one goes beyond the Shroud to concentrate on biblical studies and theology. The last sentence of the previous comment has something to do with this.Much more cooperation is needed in Shroud studies if the Church is to create a commission that can supervise and select the relevant material and hand it over to the Pontifical Academy of Science for analysis and it is they who will judge what should reach the Pope’s desk.It is clear that Jesus said some things that could be interpreted as “Take it or leave it” and that, and not any relic, is apparently what Christians should concentrate on.","date":"October 16, 2012 at 5:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/12/stephen-e-jones-starting-a-new-series-of-posts/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Stephen E.

As I wrote more than once here, there is still a lot more in the box and it will not be the Big Bang theory or the Turin Shroud that will stop churches from closing down (nine a day only in the US, it seems). For that matter, it is also the reason why 70% of Israel’s population is secular, roughly thinking along the lines archaeologist Israel Finkelstein thinks.There are two things that have to be considered by those writing on the Shroud:1) If the image was formed by a natural process, what will it tell us? Do we need it to prove the existence of Jesus or that he was crucified, dead and buried?2) If it was formed by a supernatural process, a byproduct of the Resurrection, will it answer all our questions? No, it wont. One has to go beyond Shroud studies to see what science is discovering. There are things that neither science or religion can answer now and we have to go beyond slowly.   Kelly asks if anyone knows where Ray Rogers stood on evolution. Judging from a paper he co-authored, nothing to do with the Shroud, he accepted the evolutionary process, and in this particular paper he sort of wrote about it as an automatic process, without saying anything about where the rationale came from. Such an attitude can unfortunately also be seen in some areas of Shroud studies.

That is because, as the late Daniel Raffard de Brienne told me, the relic is not part of the Deposit of Faith. I think the relic is authentic but am open minded, my faith, at least, does not depend on relics, and as I have said more than once, if the Man of the Shroud is indeed Jesus, it will still not answer many questions relating to existence. Some of the world’s best Bible scholars have now started to move in a different direction, something they should have done decades ago. They were prompted by discoveries in science that tell us about missing links between religion and science. The direction they are taking will probably pave the way for a convincing systematic theology.Rome and Turin should make the Shroud available for another hands-on examination. Will they do it?

I wouldn’t go by what seminary professors teach because each one pursues one line and that was in fact what worried Benedict XVI, but then there is only one Gregorian University.Some years ago I went for Sunday mass at the London house of a religious order and saw that there would be not one but two priests who would say the mass. They were on leave from their South American mission and on their way to Scotland and Ireland. The one who preached said some strange thing about where God could be found and invited the faithful to comment if they wished. I just kept quiet and was taken to task by the person who was accompanying me for not saying anything. I had to tell him that if I started to comment the discussion would go on till dinner time and I preferred to have coffee with the padres — including one from New Zealand — after mass since it was already winter in England and it was very cold.I discussed religion with the good “sanyasi” Dom Bede Griffiths and we couldn’t reach agreement. I did admire him as a truly spiritual man. On one occasion I was invited for lunch at a Jesuit seminary, preceded by benediction at which Father Jacques Dupuis presided. Thank God he did not preach!Now to Matthew:It is almost uncontested that the evangelist is a Jewish follower of Jesus and that his churches had a Palestinian Jewish origin. He was very close to the Jewish milieu of Jesus. His gospel is directed to Jews, so much so that Jacob Neusner used it to write his own book on Jesus.The gospel is said to resemble the type of sacred story Mircea Eliade called “myth”, which is constitutive for the religious orientation of a people or tribe, with the difference that this “myth” is not a story happening hundreds of years ago. It resembles the basic foundational stories of Israel in the Pentateuch. It is a traditional text in which the traditions about Jesus were transmitted without a radical rupture in the cultural and religious milieu.Above all, in such a milieu, the memory that Jesus was a Jew and that he was sent to Israel —- NOT TO THE GENTILES — (Matthew 10.5-6) could be preserved.So, what would Matthew be doing among the goyim, the gentiles?","date":"June 15, 2015 at 7:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/14/stephen-jones-on-the-thomas-de-wesselow-presentation/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones on the Thomas De Wesselow Presentation"},{"author":"louis","post":"That’s exactly what I have been saying from the beginning.","date":"June 16, 2015 at 9:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/14/stephen-jones-on-the-thomas-de-wesselow-presentation/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones on the Thomas De Wesselow Presentation"},{"author":"louis","post":"Naturally he would say that…","date":"February 16, 2015 at 7:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In"},{"author":"louis","post":"STURP team members did not find any evidence of painting, that being the reason why no painted linen was examined.","date":"February 16, 2015 at 10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In"},{"author":"louis","post":"Philippe, in his last Shroud book Ian Wilson provides a number of good reasons to demonstrate why the relic is not a suitable item for carbon dating.","date":"February 16, 2015 at 10:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/16/walter-mccrone-art-experts-should-not-weigh-in/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Walter McCrone:  Art Experts Should Not Weigh In"},{"author":"louis","post":"Ray Rogers was a good scientist but there is a tendency to “deify” him among some Shroudies as though whatever he wrote about the Shroud is gospel truth.

False incorruption can be due to bodies that are hermetically sealed but begin to decay the instant the coffins are opened, others because the bodies were dried in the sun after being preserved in fat, also due to things like mummification, embalming, freezing, saponification. There are also bodies that have been buried in sand or dried by the bacteria “Hifa Pombicina Pers”, others affected by lighning, radioactivity etc. Other factors that have to be taken into consideration are those found in lands with deposits of calcium, climate and so on.There are around 500 bodies in varying states of incorruption in Catholic environments.

They were probably made up after some discussion in the royal court because although “the world is a bridge, pass over it” would be in keeping with what Jesus said, “for the rest is unseen” is not.I’m sorry I have to disagree with you about “past lives”. In one of the courses I did in Parapsychology there was a demonstration using hypnotism. The parapsychologist was a very serious scholar, a Catholic priest who was awarded a gold medal for helping parents who had a child with down syndrome.He asked volunteers to come to the stage, but no one beyond 25 as heart problems could develop during the process. He chose some 7 out of the 25 volunteers after they turned their backs to him. This was done mentally, and the 7 fell on the floor in an instant. This is called regression.In one case he took the unconscious of a 15-year-old girl right upto her grandfather in minutes and she could “see” him sitting in the middle of trees and reading a newspaper.He asked her to tell him what he was reading, but she couldn’t, perhaps because a lot of mental force was required and she was very young. He then asked the audience if her parents were around and they were there. Her father confirmed that his father (and her grandfather) was a landowner and liked to read. This example is in keeping with what we learn from the Bible, not reincarnation.People sometimes talk about “past lives”, but they are actually mental images stored in the subconscious/unconscious. There was a very interesting discussion about this topic when Dr. C.T.K. Chari (Madras Christian College, India) challenged Professor Ian Stevenson (University of Virginia, USA), who was writing in favour of reincarnation but was suspected of “stage managing” cases in Sri Lanka.","date":"June 19, 2015 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/bbc-news-magazine-the-perplexing-image/","cat":"article","title":"BBC News Magazine:  The Perplexing Image"},{"author":"louis","post":"We inherit talents, tendencies, traits and só on from our ancestors.","date":"June 20, 2015 at 7:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/bbc-news-magazine-the-perplexing-image/","cat":"article","title":"BBC News Magazine:  The Perplexing Image"},{"author":"louis","post":"You’re welcome, Sampath.

There are many doubts when it comes to this image, but that is not so with scripture.It is evident that Badde is somewhat outdated when it comes to biblical studies. He refers to Bultmann, who is a thing of the past. Functions did not determine the forms, as the form critics with their “formesgeschicte” said.They put a great distance between eyewitnesses and gospels (1Cor, 15:6:  five hundred believers, “many of whom are stll alive.”). The gospel writers were composers of oral history and the continuity between Jesus traditions in oral form do resemble the continuity between eyewitnesses and historiographical sources. As Vincent Taylor wrote, if the form critics were right eyewitnesses must have ascended into heaven soon after Jesus’ resurrection.The empty tomb would mean absolutely nothing for faith if there were no appearances. That is why the Jesus movement was a “Resurrection movement”, not an “empty tomb”movement.No “bones of Jesus” were found in Jerusalem, whatever Bultmann may have thought.https://www.academia.edu/7471287/Book_Review_The_Tomb_of_Jesus_and_His_Family_Exploring_Ancient_Jewish_Tombs_Near_Jerusalems_WallsBultmann(Lutheran) was influenced by Heidegger(Catholic) and both did not give up their faith.Badde is right when he says that most theologians have long been convinced that the reporting in the gospels cannot generally be considered reliable. He only exaggerated when he said “most” and one can bet that the scepticism he refers to is partly the result of Bultmann’s influence on biblical studies for a century. As Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer wrote, Scripture is the soul of theology. So, theologians will have to reconsider their theology, which will have to be based on what is being said about scripture today, which is not as Bultmann understood it.","date":"July 4, 2015 at 9:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/04/christian-faith-eroded-to-the-very-core/","cat":"article","title":"Christian Faith Eroded to the Very Core?"},{"author":"louis","post":"There seems to have been so little progress in studying the Manoppello image after my two-hour interview with Father Heinrich Pfeiffer more than ten years ago that Paul Badde, despite his good intentions, has been far from convinving.

His latest book says that only four parables can be attributed to Jesus, so then what are we left with when scholars in general are unanimous in agreeing that the sayings are more reliable than the narratives?It does seem that scepticism is becoming very pervasive, partly the result of the fact that even the Old Testament narratives have been questioned.We have I.Finkelstein denying the historicity of the story of the Patriarchs, the Exodus and a lot more.

The Pauline references to Jesus show that it did not take long for Christians to recognise Jesus’ relationship to Yahveh. In Rom 1:3-4 there is a double use of “Son”. The first refers to to Jesus as God’s “Son”, as in Galatians 1:16, 4:6, 1 Cor 15:28, Romans  8:32. Martin Hengel argues ( “The Son of God”, Philadelphia: Fortress) that this belief emerged between AD 30 and 50.While Father Hans Küng has said a number of correct things, about evolution for example, if we use him as a guide there will be nothing left for Christians to believe in.

He did not take the oral tradition into consideration and his mistake was his inability to distinguish Bible from Scripture (as understood by all Christian denominations today). I could tell you much more, but suffice it to say that Ehrman does not even figure in a 1000+ page book on Jesus, where there are essays by prominent biblical scholars, which I will be reviewing.There this really no need to read what the atheists say, as most of them, while not believing in Jesus’ divinity, do acknowledge his existence.

I, not him, spoke against this hypothesis, also giving the reason.As for worldviews, remember that you wrote on this blog about why you believe we live in an universe where there is no sign of a (good) deity, although you are also willing to listen to what others may say. Your reaction to the world as we find it was dwelt upon in the introduction to the interview, and can apply to you as well, although you are not Christian. I did not go further because the interview was about science and the Shroud image, not about theology or philosophy. The topic will be dealt with more comprehensively in the future.Regarding STURP, I do think they did a good job, with the best equipment available during the period and no one is denying that further testing is needed.

We have gone much beyond Bultmann and Schweitzer today, today’s scholars, even Jewish ones, do not question Jesus’ healing and curing activity. He was hated and feared by the religious authorities for this reason. British-born Israeli archaeologist Shimon Gibson says that it is this activity that led to the crucifixion. I believe that the divine power in Jesus could manifest itself even in an involuntary manner, in life — and in death. You will also find this in the introduction.You mentioned “spontaneous combustion” in one of your previous comments and that is a term used in Parapsychology, which I studied for a while, doing two courses with different parapsychologists,also some on-site research, observing weird rituals, strange behaviour and other things in Spiritualist sects.

Once again, Dr. Paolo Di Lazzaro never said that his experiment demonstrated that the Shroud image was produced with radiation. It was I who wrote “radiation-like” because laser was used.We must keep one thing in mind: If it IS Jesus no amount of science will demonstrate what EXACTLY happened. The disciples who were with Jesus when power left his body INVOLUNTARILY to cure the woman with the haemorrhage in a SPLIT SECOND, that is, INSTANTANEOUSLY, did not ask questions. They saw, and believed, because the woman told them what had happened. So, if it IS Jesus we, and among us twenty-first century sceptics, are asking questions, or the “question of questions”, that will probably never be answered. The introduction to the interview mentions how the dormant divine power inside the dead JESUS may have been activated by the Father at the INSTANT of the Resurrection. God is not subject to time, we humans are. There is no indication of radiation, but neither are there signs of ingredients involved in a Maillard reaction, impurities, light, normal temperature, high temperature…NG is a first-class magazine, many people came to know about the Shroud after reading their first article on the relic.

Unfortunately they cannot be laboratory-tested because they are spontaneous. Genuine parapsychological phenomena have to be spontaneous, as Parapsychologists know, and should not be confused with claims made by Spiritualists. One prominent figure who began mixing things was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was Catholic, despite being warned by the Jesuits in England. But that was before the Society for Psychological Research was founded.C.G. Jung witnessed the spiritualist sessions of his relatives, which left him unconvinced. He was a co-founder of SPR. Freud warned him about dabbling in these kind of things, misunderstanding the Swiss psychiatrist’s motives. I think that later on, wondering why his former disciple had much interest in paranormal phenomena, he himself began to investigate, in fact began to write about it. He would never admit that C.G.Jung was right, but then what went on his mind is locked up in the archives at the Library of Congress, unavailable for research.One of my professors of Parapsychology had some of his works praised by the Society for Psychical Research and was also a first-class magician. He challenged India’s Sai Baba to perform a miracle in his presence, with scientific control. All he had to do was to fill a cavity, but there could be nothing more than a gesture. The challenge was ignored. The spiritualists were also afraid of him because he began to expose a number of frauds. He showed me a number of tiny coffins, or frogs, with his photograp inside them, black magic rituals. They were placed in front of his institute, probably at night, and he stored them in his museum, the frogs inside bottles with formol. He also studied Satanic sects, like the group founded by Anton La Vey, in Los Angeles and won a debate with a satanist, in the presence of journalists, who also witnessed his encounter with Uri Geller, who also lost.

You asked me to contact you directly and I did so, and here we go now. Allow me to comment the following: I think you have chosen the wrong title. Why? Because you are playing into the hands of well-known scientists who deny any meaning in life, who say that selfishness has always been there and will always be there, we destroy creation and creation destroys us.Unlike Benedict XVI, Pope Francis was never a professor, a theologian or a philosopher, he was always a kindly parish priest, even as archbishop of Buenos Aires, so his intention is to be more practical, to help people live in a better way. Only, he does not understand that when he uses words like “fragile world in which we live” and “if we destroy creation,creation will destroy us” he does not take into consideration that we are also part of creation, there is an element of destruction everywhere, the reason for the fragile world. To go further, when you say “apostles of selfishness”, one must add that they also exist because there are the “faithful of selfishness”. It is like a vicious circle,it is part of the show, it has something to do with the nature of human existence, or should we say existence as a whole? You may find something here:https://www.academia.edu/7343768/Viktor_Frankl_and_the_Human_Search_for_MeaningNow, on the other,  it is hard to agree with scientists who say that “science has now provided a rock of fact to which believers may cling”. That is an illusion, an appeal to scientism, one must insist that they may explain “how”, but not “why”.Nice also to see you talk about the Resurrection.

To understand him we also need to look at his life, and beyond Safranski. He was also unconsciously a Christian, whatever he said about Christianity, that being the reason why he dispatched a letter to the Vatican’s Secretary of State before his death. He was being cynical in a way, but there can be no doubt that it looked like he wanted Christianity to be true and found it lacking. That was his point of view, but he spared Christ, he had no choice.You mention the Belgian priest-scientist Father Georges Lemaitre, who first proposed the Big Bang, which is generally accepted today.

Jesus never revealed everything, although he dropped a number of hints in his parables.

Now,  let me tell you the following, for I have plenty of change in my pocket:You have avoided answering my query about demonstrating on this blog how the Jospice Mattress Imprint was formed as a result of mattress dye, as you claim. Don’t forget to carefully read Father Francis O’Leary’s words about the partial head image, which he calls the “face image”, and then show us how the dye had effect particularly in this part of the imprint:https://www.academia.edu/4691379/Can_the_Jospice_Mattress_imprint_be_compared_to_the_Image_on_the_ShroudThe only difference I had with the good priest, who had a MA in theology and was no fool, was regarding the imprint formation, which he interpreted as a spiritual phenomenon. He had a hard time obtaining funds for the charitable hospital for poor terminal patients he was running, and in such a situation it was obvious that he could not be bothered a lot with a secondary issue.The other Wikipedia link you provided is about Kersten. What was the need for that? Have you not read Ian Wilson’s books? He is an Oxford-trained historian. Kersten has an agenda which is linked to other agendas:https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The_Quest_for_Jesus_in_Shroud_research","date":"January 8, 2015 at 11:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/06/news-story-from-sindone-org/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"News Story from Sindone.org"},{"author":"louis","post":"PieroPlease be objective in your comments, avoiding insinuations and personal remarks.

Experts! But actually I don’t refer to a ‘scientific community,’ because I don’t think there is one. I sometimes refer to ‘scientific consensus,’ but even therewe must be careful. “Most scientists think…..” is often a very subjective judgement based on ones own research partners and a quick flick through Google. This is where a forum like this is so important. A senior academic and Editor-in-Chief of a respected journal might well be regarded as an expert, while a middle school science teacher might not. However, if the science teacher can demonstrate the invalidity of the academic’s work, then the tables turn.Real experts, in this context, are essentially compendia of experiences and resources, which they can use to demonstrate the value of their opinion. If they don’t do that, but rely on their authority alone, then their opinion is no more valid than anybody else’s.You’re right that “properly assessed” was rather an imprecise term. “Universally assessed” might have been better. Some will go for the “he’s a famous scientist so he must be right” angle, some for the “he disagrees with me so he must be wrong” angle (both held by several commenters here), and a few who will look more carefully at the data and references. Eventually, I trust, the truth will out.“Properly”, ah yes that was the kicker…Being a famous or a respected scientist carries a certain amount of clout for certain, but if the data sucks, it sucks. Typically one’s competitors will make sure everyone is aware of this and will come bearing elephant guns.A middle school science teacher demonstrating the invalidity of an academic’s work-sure, it can happen, but I do think you have to be careful that it’s not just slaps on the back from those in your group-there is a significant difference between posting on a blog and putting an idea in the professional arena. Not a put down-If the science is sound, the truth as you say will out.A personal question, if you don’t mind me asking-what exactly is your own background, were you ever involved in any type of independent research, before becoming a science head (at a preparatory school, I believe)? Start to work on a graduate degree at some point? If so, what area(s) did you work on? Have you ever published in a science journal on your work? This is by no means a call-out, I am just interested.

Anyway, there are some details that should help you clear your doubts regarding true and false incorruption:False incorruption:Artificial techiquesEmbalmingFactors such as dry lands, with the climate influencing the state of the body“Larvas” – the body remains intact depending on the conditions in which it is preserved,                 then turns into powder instantly when exposed to air. This can happen when                 some coffins are opened.Calcification – organic material can influence the preservation or decomposition of the                       bodyFreezing – due to natural conditions, in places like Siberia, the Himalayan region etc.Fat – Fat derived from pork can be used to preserve bodies, some tribes in Africa have         used this methodLightning and radioactivity – These can also influence the state of a body, but it seems that                                             it depends on the body Hypha Pombicina Pers – fungus that can preserve the body, at least for a while.

This is the case of the body of the Basque saint Francis Xavier,preserved in Goa, India, from which it can be deduced that it remained totally incorrupt for a long time. Many of the bodies still have blood in them, or oil/fragrance emanates from them, and these are in a perfect or semi-perfect state. Some of the saints cited were Francis de Sales, Bernadette Soubirous (Lourdes), Queen Isabel of Portugal, Philip Neri. The blood of some martyred saints has remained intact,outside the bodies. Hope you will find this helpful and, as mentioned earlier, the Church is still investigating the phenomenon.","date":"July 6, 2013 at 4:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"author":"louis","post":"Thanks for the correction, but in this case, again, what does a person who writes about wellness to do with the topic?","date":"July 3, 2013 at 1:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"author":"louis","post":"Further to the above, there is an interesting case of an Indian-born Hindu surgeon, professor at Kings College Hospital,London who testified in favour of a Catholic miracle for the canonization of a Maltese saint, went to Malta as requested by the Church commission there and was present at the canonization together with the cured child’s family at the Vatican ceremony.

Shroud studies have fallen short of the mark and it will be difficult to get Pope Francis, who can be a tough South American hombre, to agree with new testing.

It is evident that just this is sufficient for Rome to ignore the book. Why?Two former Jerusalem District Archaeologists, both of whom are highly respected, have accepted the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as the site of Jesus’ burial, so there are no “tombs”, whatever sensationalists may say. The Israeli authorities are Dr. Amos Kloner and Dr. Dan Bahat, the latter having been invited by the Vatican to lecture at Rome.When things like “whether this unprecedented event actually occurred” are said matters become worse. It will be interpreted as an unconscious lack of faith, as an attempt to “prove” the Resurrection event by hooking it on to a cloth that has yet to be authenticated. The creed does not say “… and was buried wrapped in the Turin Shroud” but it does say “..the third day he rose from the dead”.The question about the “tombs” and if the “unprecedented event actually occurred” have been dealt with in:     https://www.academia.edu/7556467/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Parts_I_and_IIandhttps://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_IIILastly, we do not know if radiation had something to do with the image formation.

Solomon built the Temple but also worshipped Asherah, whose idol was placed inside this very Temple later. Herod re-built the Temple and also constructed several Pagan temples to worship other gods. Deep inside he was Idumean. If those on the top broke the rules what could be expected from commoners? From Jesus himself we learn that they also worshipped Baal. Given the mentality prevailing during that period, would the people bother about the weave of burial shrouds?","date":"April 18, 2013 at 10:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/16/giulio-fanti-responds-to-gian-marco-rinaldis-book-review/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds to Gian Marco Rinaldi’s Book Review"},{"author":"louis","post":"Further to comments #25 and #33, it is obvious that more research is needed and the material found in Akeldama and in the Qumran caves do not help in understanding the TS, the textiles found in the caves being very crude.

After Jesus’ death Joseph of Arimathea went to Pilate to ask for permission to remove the body and the soldiers had to go go to the site of the crucifixion and come back to give a report and this may involved some documentation. You can be sure that the High Priest’s servants, serving as spíes, kept an eye on everything that was going on: any mistake committed by Pilate would provide the HP with justification to demand that he be sent back to Rome. Remember that both parties did not get along with each other due to some of the procurator’s previous actions. Then, any breaking of Sabbath rules by the disciples was what the the HP would also love to see to justify his attitudes on the whole and aim,once again, at those in the Jesus movement.Since this took a lot of time it is perhaps true that, as you said, only four of the five Judaean burial core procedures were performed. My contention is that the body was not washed, much less anointed, for the simple reason that the disciples would have to first wash to then anoint. This anointment had to do with burial, not with the previous anointment, performed when the person was alive, and which was an ancient Israelite ritual.","date":"April 23, 2013 at 8:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/16/giulio-fanti-responds-to-gian-marco-rinaldis-book-review/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds to Gian Marco Rinaldi’s Book Review"},{"author":"louis","post":"Max, you know that the Gospels do not go into details, and so when Luke says that Pilate and the High Priest “became friends” he didn’t add that it was political horse trading.

Such a comment has been heard before, but how do you explain the two different faces, that is, the one on  the TS and the other on the veil? When,in your, view was the image on the veil formed? Some excerpts from my interview with Professor Heinrich Pfeiffer, SJ on this cloth and the TS have been published, but not on the Internet. By the way, did you notice that Benedict XVI did not seem to be impressed by what he saw at Manoppello?3) Some suggestions about where the Shroud was produced were given by me a few days ago.

There are other statements that can also be questioned:For instance, it is said that “entrance to this part of the tomb was completely sealed with plaster”, and, further, archaeologists Spiegelman and Greenblatt have expressed the view that the origins and development of leprosy are largely obscure. “Leprosy in the Jewish Bible may well refer to psoriasis” it is stated.But is that true? Were first-century Jews unable to distinguish between psoriasis (non-contagious) and leprosy (contagious)? Would there be a colony for people suffering from a non-contagious disease? Would a man suffering from a non-contagious disease be buried in a tomb that was completely sealed?The fact that Jesus stayed in the house belonging to Simon the leper, in a leper colony, on his way to Jerusalem led Yigael Yadin to the conclusion that this was done on purpose, to defy the Essenes, since small groups belonging to the sect are believed to have lived in Jerusalem according to him, Father Bargil Pixner and Prof. Charlesworth.

When one pries into personal beliefs when discussing Shroud science, that is not an objective approach.It seems to be incorrect to link any inauthenticist views to Satanic tendencies, whether as belief or influence, and that is because evil is easy to find. You can see it among people who think they are religious, just as you may fail to find it among atheists.

Why create life if one has to lose it to find it? There is much more to this than “meets the ear”. Jesus spoke in riddles, he did so deliberately, so that once could understand by reading between the lines. The message lies hidden there.History shows us that churches in general have never understood the true message of Christ, As G.K.Chesterton wrote, “Christianity has not been tried and found wanting.” Has it really been tried and by how many? It leads to an extremely difficult path, as Jesus himself warned.Pope Francis speaks his mind, come what may, he seems to have been “dropped from heaven” and one can only agree that he is on the right track.","date":"July 10, 2014 at 10:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/07/is-francis-right/","cat":"books","title":"Is Francis Right?"},{"author":"louis","post":"There lived a soldier who won the Victoria Cross, also a poet and deep thinker, who is slowly being remembered, some lines from one of his (publisher censored) poems now being brought to light.http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-28243999Siegfried Sassoon came from the famous Baghdadi Jewish family who made a name in Bombay (Mumbai), India.

John  had presented me with a query and I answered him but he seems to have not paid sufficient attention to it. If he did, he would see that there is that what I call ” a lot more in the box”. Example? The last sentence in this posting. Freud understood such things, Teilhard called it a side effect of evolution, but it was Jesus who, 2000 years before them, explained the problem and how it could be avoided. Of course, it also relates to the creation of the Universe.","date":"March 30, 2014 at 5:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/30/john-klotz-wants-your-feedback/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Wants Your Feedback"},{"author":"louis","post":"Brahman is the Absolute and impersonal, which is what led Swami Vivekananda to accept Christ in his Vedanta Hinduism.

I once played volleyball with his colleague Father Richard McHugh, but his approach was different— but the Christian message is that Jesus is not negotiable. So the meaning of Christ in the cosmic scene, for all people, nations, races and so on would have to be taken into account.The matter can become complicated because Hinduism has around eighty schools of interpretation, God can be He, She, or It, worse, He can be an illusion. That is what he is in Buddhism, where there is no deity, however Buddha is said to have dodged questions he could not answer by telling the people who asked him questions that they were wasting time with speculation instead of concentrating on getting out of the karmic cycle.In my view, he did not answer the question, Who started this karmic cycle?

According to Qumran excavator Father Roland de Vaux, who was also the first editor-in-chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the settlement/monastery was razed by the “Decima Legio Fretensis”, the Tenth Roman Legion commanded by Vespasian (at that time) on the way to besiege Jerusalem in AD 70. There were no Jewish or Jewish Christian communities in the region after that, the latter group having fled to Pella.Frale’s claim was probably based on the theory that the Shroud was stored in a jar like the ones found in the Qumran caves. I took a photograph of one of these jars many years ago,and there seems to be no reason why such jars were not used in Jerusalem and elsewhere in ancient Palestine. It is of course possible that the Shroud was stored in such a jar, but not necessarily in Qumran. There were Essenes living in Jerusalem, who, in my view, may have traded jars made in Qumran for clothing and footwear, for instance.Some of the material I have cannot be revealed and one person in the field of Shroud studies with whom I shared it also preferred to keep quiet. It is a “hint”, but not an essential link in establishing a link with the knights. If you have read what had been going on in Shroud research around a decade ago and the recent e-mail from the highly qualified Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo on possibilities of fresh carbon dating, a stretch of which was posted on this blog about two weeks ago, the picture becomes crystal clear.

First, people don’t seem to bother that much about tombs, children were seen playing “football” with skulls from the Talpiot tomb. Amos Kloner was working under pressure, he had to abandon the excavation of the next tomb as the ultra-orthodox “haredim” began to throw stones at him. Second, the names are common, which is what Professor Charlesworth realised only later. The pool of names was small during the period, as anyone who reads the NT will deduce. The second wife of Herod the Great was named Mariamne, and God knows how many ossuaries with this name are lying in unexcavated caves. “Mara” is probably a second woman, perhaps a sister of Mariamene, and must have died later because two scribal hands can be seen in the inscription. The Patio tomb also has an ossuary with the name “Mara”. Was she also a “lordess”?! “Mara” can also be masculine and the Syrian Orthodox Church, who originally seemed to have had many members of the Judaeo-Christian community — one remnant is the people called “Nasranis” in the south of India — only began calling woman saints “Martha”, not “Mara”, in the fourth century. Their bishops and patriarchs are addressed as “Mar” and “Mor”, and there is no feminine form, they have no women priests.","date":"May 3, 2014 at 3:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/03/new-fictional-book-blood-doctrine/","cat":"books","title":"New Fictional Book: Blood Doctrine"},{"author":"louis","post":"Hi clublu2201(the rest is missing)This is the second invitation to go to Saint Louis, but unfortunately I can’t go.

Meier, Daveb chose the right scholar and that is the reason why in the article on the HSG website I begin by mentioning him. It must also be added that he is not without opposition, even from Catholic scholars such as Father Anthony Kelly (Australia) and Professor Luke Timothy Johnson (US), not to forget Jewish scholar Rabbi Jacob Neusner (US) who says that there is no difference between the “Jesus of history” and the “Christ of faith.”In his book on Jesus of Nazareth Benedict XVI states that he begins where the German Catholic scholar Rudolf Schnackenburg finished. But most noteworthy is the fact that Schnackenburg felt that Jesus “hovers” in the gospels and one should employ the (often used) term “mysterium Christi” to describe this. If the Pope read more about what Meier wrote, he would find the scholar stating the following about Jesus:“Not only does he speak riddles and parables, but he is making himself the ultimate riddle and parable of God by speaking in this strange, enigmatic way.”So, as anyone can see, even Meier, with all his enormous erudition, bumped into the “mysterium Christi” noticed by Schnackenburg. To go a bit further, another great scholar,Adolf von Harnack, wrote in the last century that “Jesus’ relation to the Father was his secret and no psychology will fathom it.” He was not exaggerating, for even Jung, also with his enormous erudition, tried his best and gave up trying to find a gap between the “humanity” and the “divinity”.

However, there was one drawback, not limited to him and seen in the works of other scholars in the field. They keep an eye on new discoveries in science, which often involves discarding one theory in favour of a new one, and when that cannot be housed in theology they turn to philosophy. The result is process theology and other attempts to explain away differences between science and theology and the question which raises its head, which they themselves ask, is Who and What is God? This is nothing more than a dead end, leaving the faithful dumbfounded and more empty pews in churches.We also have Msgr. John P. Meier, who comes with an imaginary round table with Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Agnostics locked up in a library to thrash out differences. He admits he is writing only what all of them can accept without hesitation, and that is exactly his big mistake. He should write what he, as an historian, feels is acceptable, not to please others. As an extremely erudite Bible scholar, does he not know that Jesus during his earthly life would only admit a Yes or No, one could say “a take it or leave it” approach? Writing to please academics is not correct, it can mislead the faithful. After Meier finishes writing his last two volumes you can bet there will be more tons of books “about Jesus” because he has not filled the blanks, blanks that have to be filled for a complete picture to be obtained. The more daring Biblical scholars, not writing to please anyone, are slowly filling these blanks, and that will eventually clear many doubts, those that Barbour, and now Meier, failed to remove. Till then we will continue to see less baptisms, more empty churches, rising numbers of atheists, agnostics, those sitting over the wall, and former fundamentalists like Gerd Lüdemann and others praying to the universe!","date":"January 4, 2014 at 8:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/03/rest-in-peace-ian-barbour/","cat":"books","title":"Rest in Peace Ian Barbour"},{"author":"louis","post":"I invite readers interested in reading the above exchange to judge what is the exact reason why David is not interested in discussion anymore, while continuing to justify his stand in a manner that is not all convincing. Max ( much more qualified to write on the Shroud because of his on-site research and the detailed studies he has at his disposal, but who no longer comments on this blog) was right about the blind spots he detected, and here we go:Of course the Resurrection is something beyond human experience, it was an unique event. One must read all the literature that appeared in the region during the period to understand it all. Quote: “In his highly disciplined historic approach, Meier quite properly rejects drawing on the Resurrection as part of the discipline he has chosen.”Reply: There is absolutely no reason to state that J.P. Meier “properly rejects drawing on the Resurrection as part of the discipline he has chosen.” Not even the highly learned monsignor said this! The discipline he has chosen is history and it depended on him to choose whether to include the Resurrection or not in his series. The “quite properly rejects” can only apply to the people who sat at the imaginary round table with him, not to the field of history. Does it have to be repeated over and over again that he was writing to conform to the expectations of these people? As such, he was obliged to omit one part of the history, however that does not justify saying that he “properly rejected” the Resurrection as part of the discipline.  Quote:- “I have the greatest respect for all of the recent popes, commencing with Leo XIII. I am unaware of having insulted any”Reply See #4, where it is stated, “Certainly there are limits to what the historical method can achieve, and in order to discover the “Jesus of Faith” we must look elsewhere, such as to Benedict’s “Jesus of Nazareth”. However in a rational age, this “Jesus of Faith” must surely need to correspond to the “historical Jesus” rather than some idealised pietistic fantasy”Does one have to consult Freud’s works to comprehend what he meant by Free Association or is there no need for this because the association is evident here? Quote; “Anythng written by me in a printed publication, was only published on a web-site consequential to a personal invitation to do so.”Reply: The question of personal invitation does not arise here, it is irrelevant, and again it is going off the point. The problem is explaining how one who claims to be Catholic, wrote a Shroud article for a parish magazine, which was also posted on a Shroud website,admits the fact that he doubts the Resurrection and associates Pope Benedict’s “Jesus of faith”with “pietistic fantasy.”   Davor Aslanovski is an Oxford scholar and stated on this very blog that he only exchangescomments with people who identify themselves fully on a blog. He was driven out of this blog unjustly, and apparently not the kind of person to use “I” this and “I” that all the time like a self-appointed judge, he said what he had to say bluntly, not bothered about trying to impress or flatter anyone. He stopped commenting on the blog, left it in disgust, but not before speaking his mind to the persons who forced him out.","date":"January 6, 2014 at 8:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/03/rest-in-peace-ian-barbour/","cat":"books","title":"Rest in Peace Ian Barbour"},{"author":"louis","post":"With reference to David’s comment above, anyone who is bothered to read this exchange will notice that the quarrel began with David contradicting what I had initially posted. He had to get even because a comment posted by me another thread about carbon dating the pollen grains did not defend the position he had assumed. For those who care to wonder what exactly is going on — and I am accused of using strategems! — he left another comment on the Abgar letter thread making  a nasty insinuation in response to what I had written. Who, exactly, is looking for a quarrel? One should be careful when underestimating someone else’s intelligence. What also comes to mind is the blind spots and the hypocrisy Max detected. This is therefore not a self-chosen quarrel, it is a response to provocations, and if the strategem continues, it will be met with further adequate response, particularly because it is incorrect to hit below the belly, to respond with comments that go off the point and to deny having made comments or adopting attitudes after having announced them with pomp and circumstance on this very thread. There seems to be no room for prima donnas here, and I am sure everyone welcomes team work where constructive criticism can be seen. Pope Benedict XVI did cite J.P. Meier’s works,but he was referring to the volumes that were published till some time ago. It is highly doubtful that he would endorse the monsignor’s reluctance to deal with the Resurrection, because he describes the exact meaning of the event in his own work . But being a very intelligent scholar he surely understands that Meier is writing for those sharing the round table with him, not for the faithful. If those who think they are part of the flock and use “A Marginal Jew” as a yardstick to judge what can or cannot be believed they are on the wrong track. Benedict also did not cite Meier in his talk at Regensburg, he referred to Father Rudolf Schnackenburg. Davor Aslanovski has been studying Byzantine and art history and had every right to express his opinions as a qualified scholar, in fact there are people in this blog who are saying roughly the same things he wrote about.

Meier he says that he does not agree that “Meier’s work will be the cause of Christians falling from their faith, quite the reverse.” That was not exactly what was commented by me, for Meier maybe just one who can mislead the faithful. Why do I say that? I do not see how he considers the Resurrection, a less historical event if one reads the New Testament, the central belief of Christianity, to be beyond the scope of his work. Or is it beyond the scope of his work because he has to please the Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Agnostics sitting at the imaginary round table he has convened? “Quite the reverse”? It does not seem so. There is talk about a Fourth Quest now, Meier has not filled all the blanks, and there is a liberal Protestant scholar (and pastor) who wisely says that the quest can be laid to rest. Till when only God knows. Everyone, Strauss, Reimarus, Baur, Schweitzer, Bultmann, Meier has failed.  Anyone interested in learning more about this can read the interview-article “What do we know about the Bible: An interview with Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ” on the Internet.If the Resurrection is not judged to be at least a less historical event, what was it: a psychic event? If that is accepted then one might as well stop reading Meier, with those countless footnotes, and other scholars writing to please others, unlike Pope Benedict XVI — writing as Joseph Ratzinger — who gave a more convincing explanation to a hardened atheist and communist like Peter Seewald, former editor of “Der Spiegel” and brought him back to the Catholic faith he had lost. So what can be read, if the central belief of Christianity was nothing more than some sort of psychic event, a collective hallucination, an image on a burial shroud and more? Suggestions? Frederick Myers, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (minus Sherlock Holmes), Allan Kardec with his “Gospel according to Spiritualism”… Whether all that is convincing is another story….Just because the faithful from countries in Asia and Africa fill the pews of a parish in NZ, taking away most of the “vanilla flavour” in the process, does not mean that the Church will continue to be healthy in their native countries. The “wave” has not reached these countries so far. It arrived in Europe a long time ago, and is slowly making its way all along the US. When the faithful in these countries, often struggling to make ends meet, manage to fill their pockets considerably, able to buy books about science and theology that do not really remove the doubts, only adding to the confusion, they will forget about going to church.By then John P. Meier will have finished the last two volumes, with no mention of the Resurrection, pleased to have satisfied the demands of those who shared the round table with him. That perhaps may contribute to the doubting, but richer, faithful to buy less books because the whole story can be found in a few volumes, a nutshell. More time and money will be available to spend on material interests, but not in any parish.","date":"January 4, 2014 at 5:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/03/rest-in-peace-ian-barbour/","cat":"books","title":"Rest in Peace Ian Barbour"},{"author":"louis","post":"David seems to be trying to indulge in psychoanalysis, and has got it all wrong. I know that Monsignor John P. Meier says mass in a parish church and think he should use his enormous erudition when it comes to biblical studies to tell the whole story as a historian, even if he rejects the Resurrection event as something that should be taken literally. It would be better than writing that it is beyond the scope of his study and thus avoid the possibility of the round table ending as a fiasco.There is another priest, considered to have been the “scholar’s scholar”  — both by Catholic and Protestant scholars in the US — before his retirement, more liberal than conservative, a thousand times more qualified than Meier, who also devoted a lot of time to “scholarly pursuits’ and also says mass. He did not hesitate in explaining the Resurrection, central in Christian belief, to believers and non-believers alike in his books and understood, like Helmut Koester, the difficulties in grasping the Jesus of history:https://www.academia.edu/4700001/What_do_we_know_about_the_Bible_An_interview_with_Joseph_A._Fitzmyer_SJ   I do not believe that Monsignor Meier denies the Resurrection, only that he had to please those sharing the round table with him.Of course, there are others, as Dennett seems to imply in a recent book, who are caught in a pulpit, but he seems to have forgotten that there are also those caught in a pew. Not because of any retirement benefits, but due to the fact that the church can also be a nice place for a social gathering.David provides us with some lines from Meier’s CV, for which reason I will cite something about Father Fitzmyer’s qualifications:— Obtained his PhD under the guidance of Professor Wiilliam F. Albright, at Johns Hopkins— Worked with Father Roland de Vaux, OP, archaeologist who excavated Qumran     and editor-in-chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls, at the scrollery in Jerusalem in 1956     and was thus one of the first scholars to handle these precious documents— Was on the Pontifical Biblical Commission— Professor of Hebrew and Aramaic at the University of Chicago, for a while— Professor of Biblical Studies at Oxford University, for around two years— Fifteen honorary doctorates— A gold medal (excellence in Biblical Studies) from the British Academy— Translated Hebrew, Aramaic, Coptic, Greek and Latin— Co-editor of the Jerome Biblical Commentary, together with Fathers     Raymond E. Brown and Roland E. Murphy— Author of more than thirty books in the field of Biblical Studies, many of     them so important that they appear in the bibliographies of books published     by other renowned Biblical scholars  — Was the expert consulted to identify the Aramaic inscription on the so-called     James ossuary— Edited and translated the (Aramaic) Tobit texts of the Dead Sea Scrolls, found in     Qumran, cave 4 — Wrote what scholars consider to be the best guides on the Dead Sea Scrolls— Was was the key figure in the Catholic-Lutheran dialogue, resulting in the agreement     signed in Augsburg, Germany, an important step in Christian unityThere are many more qualifications, relating to the SBL,CBQ etc. but those given above should suffice.Last, but not the least, David insinuates that Pope Benedict XVI— whose book on Jesus of Nazareth is consulted even by Protestant scholars — ,the former head of the Church to which he belongs, has been indulging in “pietistic fantasy”. I have never seen anyone chained to a pew in the church, the door is always open for anyone to leave. Why waste time in such a Church? Perhaps that faith which is missing can be found in a round table, where sceptical scholars are unwilling to entertain any talk about the central belief in Christianity.","date":"January 5, 2014 at 1:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/03/rest-in-peace-ian-barbour/","cat":"books","title":"Rest in Peace Ian Barbour"},{"author":"louis","post":"Have you read what you posted in #4 and my reply in #5?

They are human, just as the authors of popular books are, and, talking from experience, that is, after interviews, reviews and other material, one can sometimes easily detect prejudices, distortions and even hatred in what they write.Some genuine artefacts have been found in Israel.Two of these are from the Second Temple period: one is an inscription indicating the way to the place of trumpeting and the other is an ossuary probably belonging to Nicanor, the Alexandrian, who built the “beautiful gate” mentioned in the New Testament (Acts) and also in the Talmud:https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_IIISome people have questioned the existence of the Jerusalem Temple, both for religious and political reasons, and these artefacts constitute just one reason to show why they are wrong.Another problem is forgeries, used by agenda-driven documentary producers and some others. The James ossuary, with its partially forged inscription, is just one of them. In this case we do not need it to prove the existence of Jesus and James the Just, the “brother of the Lord”, the first of the twelve Jewish-Christian bishops of Jerusalem. Josephus mentions both Jesus and James in “Antiquities”.","date":"January 10, 2015 at 7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/10/six-major-artifacts-including-the-shroud-of-turin-the-true-cross-and-john-the-baptist/","cat":"books","title":"Six major artifacts, including the Shroud of Turin, the True Cross, and John the Baptist?"},{"author":"louis","post":"To all who are reading this thread:Has anyone read any comment I made above saying that the book is the official position of the Catholic Church?Culture has a heavy influence when it come to relics.

You may have misunderstood me because I do not really swallow everything that RD has said, in fact he can be very biased, but there are questions he has raised quite rightly.Which is what brings me to the days in school and college, where the influence of the Jesuits, of different nationalities, was very strong. With the American Jesuits I learnt sports, with the German Jesuit lay brothers, all very tough veterans of WW II, fighting in the Reichswehr and Luftwaffe, fed up with destruction in war, making them become missionaries with a lot of conviction, I learnt discipline. While working as a journalist after college I was invited for lunch one day at a big Jesuit seminary. The lunch was preceded by Benediction, officiated by the famous and controversial Belgian Jesuit Father Jacques Dupuis. At that time it looked like he was mixing things up in his theology, today it is different. The issues he raised have also been tackled by the professor of Goan origin Gavin D’Costa at the University of Bristol, advisor to both Catholic and Anglican Churches in England.     What I am trying to say is that in a way the field of Shroud studies is very much like the fields of Biblical Archaeology and Studies, where we can can see extremes.

Chari, who taught at Madras Christian College, India, and investigated cases in Burma and Sri Lanka (see http://www.ctkchari.org). While doing a course in Parapsychology my professor called for volunteers willing to be hypnotized for regression and a fifteen-year-old girl could see her grandfather reading a newspaper and the background was green. She tried her best to read what he had been reading but did not succeed as she could not support the strain. Her parents happened to be present on that day, the last day of the course, to see their daughter receive her certificate and the father confirmed that he came from a family of landowners, therefore the green background. This experience is more in keeping with what is learnt in modern psychology.   In another course the importance of scientific control was stressed and the professor was known to have unmasked people claiming to perform miracles or other feats. Uri Geller could not bend any spoon in his presence and there were around ten journalists, including one from a TV channel, around. It was reported that Geller took the first flight back to Tel Aviv that very day. The professor had also challenged a famous man claiming to perform miracles to do it in his presence, under scientific control. All that had to be done was to fill a cavity, but there could be nothing more than uttering a word or making a gesture. The challenge was not accepted.Buddhist belief in reincarnation actually comes from Hinduism, which is much more older, and involves metempsychosis.

It is for reasons like these that some scholars have now suggested that there should be no “biblical studies”, it should be a part of “Near Eastern studies”.Even the Essenes were not immune to pagan influence, having derived their dualism, although subordinate to monotheism, from Iran. 300 BC to AD 200 was a period of intense pluralism, as both Jewish and Christian scholars have noted:https://www.academia.edu/12734802/Book_Review_Beyond_the_Essene_Hypothesis_The_Parting_of_the_Ways_between_Qumran_and_Enochic_JudaismThe Essenes tried to tackle the problem of evil that began dividing Jewish groups in 300 BC and reached what they believed was a solution: “God has has put two spirits, good and bad, in human beings”, but then, as they believed they were the “sons of light” while all other people, including other Jewish groups were the “sons of darkness” they formed an “eschatological army”, again demonstrating the influence of Iranian dualism. In the process they also absorbed details from a Hebrew Herodian army manual, which is turn, was based on a Roman army manual and the Romans were the “kittim” whom the Essenes hated.

If anyone could put coins over the eyes it would be Nicodemus, who must have had money in his pocket. There are, however, two problems with this hypothesis:1) There is still no clear evidence that any coin can be seen over an eye. Giorgio was supposed to upload a paper with images to support the coins-over-the eyes-theory2) Max thinks that coins in tombs justify his position. He does not take into account that the Sadducees were heavily influenced by the Greeks, in fact imitated their lifestyle in some ways. Since “Sheol” was very much in the collective unconscious of all Jewish groups, whether Sadducees, Pharisees or Essenes, nothing rules out the possibilty that coins were used to pay Charon to ferry souls across the river Styx.

Public relations that are barely able to hide the tension lurking behind, a tension that is revealed when it explodes openly — when public relations is not possible.  Posting Shroud papers on Academia.edu will not attract academics to the field because if they want to delve deeper they will inevitably be led to Shroud sites and publications, where they will see that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing in some places and get the impression that confusion abounds.They will either lose interest or read what is being said just to keep in touch with what is going on, but unwilling to enter a minefield.To get something published in the “top” sites and publications you have to be a chummy, no matter whether what you have written is a useful contribution or just plain rubbish. I regret having to tell you that you yourself have succumbed to this policy, but can understand it on account of the pressure you must be facing from those behind the scenes who decide who is and is not a chummy and to whom a door should be opened, albeit indirectly. One clear example? There are people who are not exactly prominent Shroud scholars who have received mention in your last paragraph and others who are, that is, who have contributed with useful papers based on important discoveries, have been ignored. Of course, they are no longer chummies and have been unjustly driven out of the Shroud scenario.Curiously, some time ago one prominent Shroud scholar was the object of scorn simply because he was writing papers beyond his field of expertise and although his contributions were noteworthy. At the same time another scholar, who was not at all prominent, began writing absolute nonsense — I received correspondence from prominent Shroud scholars backing my position — and was mentioned 4(four) times.Something must change drastically if academics are to enter the scene and if Shroudies wish to gain the confidence of the authorities, both in Turin and Rome. You can do something to make this a reality, given that the blog is very useful, but it will depend on you to resist the pressure.","date":"December 27, 2013 at 9:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/26/papers-from-1991-shroud-conference/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Papers from 1991 Shroud Conference"},{"author":"louis","post":"O.K.

We should not think of resurrection like the ancient Egyptians did, to be wrapped like mummies, with or without valuables.According to Moltmann, “not the corpse that we can dissect objectively, but the body with which we identify in life, stands in the life of resurrection hope. There is no meaningful hope for the body we have, but only for the body we are.”It is important to grasp that he understands Jesus’ resurrection to be a physical resurrection, but his theology is built on eschatology, hope found in the resurrected Christ.Buddhism is a negative soteriology, that in fact was the way Buddha understood it. True Buddhism can only be practised in a monastery, where there is no room for material and sexual impulses. I would say that the Jains go even deeper, but will discuss this on another occasion.The problem is that in Buddhism in the end there is Nothing. Who can envision nothingness? We have to undergo countless reincarnations to climb the karmic ladder and rid ourselves of existence. Buddha understood very well what he was saying, but it does not seem that those who call themselves Buddhists and are immersed in the material world do. Physicists say that nothing comes from nothing and nothing goes to nothing. So how do we solve the problem? In my view, the solution lies in the parables of Jesus, which were deliberately meant to be riddles. There is no room for belief in reincarnation here, we have to be truly involved in the quest for God, in truth and in spirit. In Hinduism, in general, where there is reincarnation, a belief that is not essential for the Brahmo Samaj, the aim is to unite oneself with the godhead, which is more in agreement with what Christians hold. There is one saying of Jesus that made an extremely strong impact on Hinduism. It is found in the Sermon of the Mount: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, they shall see God”. For Swami Vivekananda, the founder of Modern Hinduism, just this saying did away with the need for Scripture.As for atheism, that will take us to a long discussion, but I don’t think that there can be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.If we have a deep religious sense, then we would think like  Wittgenstein, who went beyond philosophy:https://www.academia.edu/6085481/Why_was_Wittgensteins_burial_attended_by_a_religious_ceremonyAll the best.","date":"September 13, 2015 at 12:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/12/new-barrie-schwortz-podcast/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"New Barrie Schwortz Podcast"},{"author":"louis","post":"Matthew L., you should hear the podcast, then go to the links.","date":"September 12, 2015 at 3:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/12/new-barrie-schwortz-podcast/","cat":"radio_and_podcasts","title":"New Barrie Schwortz Podcast"},{"author":"louis","post":"Thanks, Colin.

It is what it is. I’m a scientist and I want quantification and measurement and evidence, but theologians can look for meaning and interpretation without necessarily needing the same.”Sorry, Hugh, while it is possible to agree that the pontiffs need no explanation, the same cannot be said about many among the laity, sceptics,cynics, atheists and agnostics. There was pressure on Turin in 1988 and there still is today. For the pressure in 1988 see the interview with Father Heinrich Pfeiffer:http://holyshroudguild.org/uploads/2/7/1/7/2717873/an_interview_with_professor_heinrich_pfeiffer_sj.pdfThe pressure today can be seen in your query to Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo. What I mean is that if you, as a “Catholic to the core”, did apply some pressure now, what about the rest in the list?The pontiffs are humans, like the rest of us, and it is hard to believe that their curiosity has not been aroused, although they do not mix up the relic with matters of faith. Good theology has to be based on Scripture, good Shroud theology on what you call “quantification and measurement and evidence.” If not, then it is guesswork and speculation, and that, as you know, living in England,where Prime Minister David Cameron, a practising Anglican who faced attacks last week, will simply not be swallowed.","date":"May 1, 2014 at 1:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/28/discovery-promoting-shroud-video-on-feature-about-two-new-saints/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Discovery Promoting Shroud Video on Feature About Two New Saints"},{"author":"louis","post":"The narrow way, but it is ….

I am not defending him, although I can understand his point of view, which is crystal clear in Ian Wilson’s last Shroud book.Who took care of the sampling was Dr. Michael Tite, together with Professors Gonella and Riggi, authorised by Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero, a prelate who is said to have been influenced by his Carmelite background, which means is, “there are no material supports for faith.” Gonella and Riggi took a very long time to decide from which site the sample had to be cut, deciding on the dirtiest part of the relic. The rest is known. Yes, the interpretation of the dating should be multidisciplinar, and there are several hypotheses on how it may have been skewed. The Church is willing to conduct a new C14 test, however it appears that the hesitation is due to mistakes made in the past. Now, what happens if the new dating gives a medieval date? Will the clerics feel like returning it to the di Savoia family? It is always better, therefore, to refrain from cutting another piece of the precious relic unnecessarily, more studies and a fresh hands-on examination are needed. The papers, including the peer-reviewed ones, do not seem to have convinced Turin and Rome. Benedict XVI sent his message to the last Shroud conference held in Dallas, Francis is more bothered about serious issues, the relic is not an article of faith.Perhaps all Christian believers have to act like Carmelites when the need arises, almost all are “brought to the test” at some time or the other in their lives.

The point that was stressed was this:two hands were involved in the inscription.The owner of the ossuary had problems with the government for other reasons, also relating to antiquities.There are two problems here:–Father James Martin is not an authority in biblical studies— Ben Witherington III apparently has an ulterior motive to promote the ossuary.

Scholars are now ruthlessly adopting the bottom up approach, questioning everything under the sun.Recently a renowned scholar said that no one doubts Jesus’ crucifixion although Golgotha is a myth, while saying that the Exodus was a myth and leaving the door open to the story of Moses that can be interpreted in many ways, all of them leading to Egypt. The big differences arise when it comes to the origin of monotheism.There is no proof of the Exodus, the Josianic conquest, that the kingdom of David and Solomon was as big as described in the Bible. In fact, some scholars have described the two kings as “petty chieftains”. The Temple Solomon built actually used a North Syrian pagan temple as a model. There are very few positive indications in archaeology:https://www.academia.edu/18994343/The_key_role_of_Biblical_Archaeology_in_Exegesis_An_Interview_with_Professor_Israel_FinkelsteinWhat happens when it comes to New Testament archaeology? The best scholars, epigraphers and archaeologists I have spoke to rightly dismiss the James ossuary, and although Dr. Dan Bahat, former Jerusalem District Archaeologist, believes that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was the site where Jesus was buried, one or two doubts remain. The Garden tomb, “Gordon’s tomb” — General Gordon was not an archaeologist — does not mean much.Given that the Turin Shroud does not form a part of the Catholic Church’s deposit of faith, believers are ultimately left with Jesus’ post-Easter appearances as described in the New Testament.But, what about Scripture as a whole? How did Jesus view Scripture or what parts of it did he judge to be true? That is what historiographers are studying, but that is another story…","date":"November 29, 2015 at 8:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/29/new-very-short-video-from-national-geographic/","cat":"video","title":"New, Very Short Video from National Geographic"},{"author":"louis","post":"Really?

However, let’s start from the beginning and let me tell you something that about what I have gathered after 20 years as a Religion Writer.I would not rely that much on what J. P. Meier writes. In his latest book he has Jesus uttering just four parables, nothing more. He will not address the Resurrection topic in his series. What is the reason for this? Other biblical scholars, who are also historians, have done this, and it will be the topic of my next review. If you are one to buy books my recommendation is “The Real Jesus”,by Professor Luke Timothy Johnson.Father Joseph A. Fitzmyer, SJ has more clout.

Let us proceeed step by step:In Islam there is “maktoub”, “it is written” and this is fatalism, which could correspond to some extent with determinism in philosophy and even with Calvin’s predestinatiom. You also say that evil connects with the “Fall of Angels, and the origin of Satan.” We must ask, Who and What is Satan? Is it correct to capitalise “satan” when passages in the Bible do not have an individual in mind? It seems that in these passages it can mean “adversary” and can also be used of human beings.In the Book of Job, Satan is not an evil entity, he has an errand given to him by Yahveh and ultimately the “serpent” of the Book of Genesis becomes “Satan”. There was a change in interpretation as time went by.It must be remembered that Jesus referred to Peter as “satan” and therefore one is inclined to agree with Father Jerome Murphy-O’Connor’s contention that the saying ” I saw satan and the angels falling down from heaven” was as a meteor from Qumran that landed in the New Testament. This is possible because some Essenes are said to have joined the Christ movement and I think that they brought the idea of the battle between the “sons of light” and the “sons of darkness” with them.Was Judas an agent of Yahveh or a disciple tempted by Satan? The New Testament leads us to believe that the traitor acted on his own free will, and ultimately the crucifixion was also the will of God.

There is one thing that unites all of them: the belief that Jesus was crucified and buried (dead) in Jerusalem.I am pasting here what was posted on another thread yesterday: 1.August 24, 2015 at 6:16 pmReplyFurther to my previous comment, I want to reiterate that no one has been able to disprove the assertions refuting the claim about the burial of Jesus in a location outside Jerusalem made in:https://www.academia.edu/7893085/The_Quest_for_Jesus_in_Shroud_researchThe claims that Jesus survived the crucifxion is the result of an obsession with monotheism,when people thought that God would not allow any “prophet” to die crucified.We must remember that the New Testament is in many ways a Jewish document, becauseexcept for Luke, the authors of the Gospels were Jews. It is for that reason that there is now an “Annotated Jewish New Testament”, a Jewish interpretation and a nice job, not drifting from the Jewish milieu.The Jews never denied the crucifixion. Not long ago the Israeli writer Amoz Oz wrote that guilt was invented in his country 2000 years ago. Lest I be misunderstood, I hasten to say that there can be no accusation of “Christ killers”. The Gospels narratives leave no room for doubts that both Roman and Temple authorities were responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion and death. According the late Pinchas Lapide,who was a respected Jewish scholar and holocaust survivor, the Temple authorities handed Jesus over to the Romans.No Jewish archaeologist or scholar has any doubt that Jesus was crucified and buried in Jerusalem. It is some unfounded claims that led to the controversy about the place of burial in Jerusalem, but no doubt was expressed about the crucifxion, death and burial in Jerusalem:https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_IIIThere are claims that some pathologists in Europe have stated that Jesus survived the crucifixion.

If the image was formed in a natural manner, what will it tell us? We know what was done to Jesus. It is in the Gospels. Mahatma Gandhi literally broke into tears the first time he saw a crucifix, when he left London, where he was studying law at the Inner Temple, and went to Rome on holiday and visited the Sistine Chapel. It is doubtful if he knew something about the Shroud.If supernatural agency was involved will it answer all our questions? It doesn’t seem so because science is telling us some things that clash with what is written in the Bible. There are things beyond the purview of the Bible and systematic theologians have not been able to answer questions that have been raised so far. We have to “rethink” what is meant by Monotheism. Is that heresy? No it is’nt. We must remember that Jesus said things that made people who heard him realise that he was presenting himself as someone different from the rest of mankind. He has his own views about God, Moses and Scripture. If the Shroud image was produced by supernatural means it will have to conform to these views.Life in the world is getting to be very uncomfortable, more people are now wondering if God exists and where he can be found. It has left even great biblical scholars thinking:https://www.academia.edu/12851672/The_Historical_Jesus_The_view_of_Professor_Geza_VermesBut is not enough to just think of Jesus in terms of an existential spiritual legacy.You can contact me by email whenever you need.","date":"June 18, 2015 at 12:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/17/the-shroud-on-nbcs-today-show/","cat":"television","title":"The Shroud on NBC’s Today Show"},{"author":"louis","post":"The tomb of Saint Edward the Confessor is like the “holy of holies” in Westminster Abbey.

Do you believe that His Holiness will swallow that?Different religions can indeed meet in harmony, and they should do that. But why involve a relic that is still controversial, and which is being interpreted to challenge the belief I mentioned? Is that harmony? No, it isn’t. There are many places where people of different religions can meet in harmony, where there is respect for the differing beliefs.Why do Hindus in India and other places accept Jesus as Avatar, incarnation of God, without ever having heard of the Turin Shroud? They have either read the Gospels or have been guided by the great Hindu sages, many of them saintly men. During my on-site research into non-Christian sects and religions I have met and spoken to their leaders, whether preachers, priests, witches, wizards, and so on. One of them even told me that he was afraid how God would judge him because he was also worshipping evil entities. I then asked  him why he did not stop worshipping them. He said that God was above all of them, and he was referring to the Christian God. I told him that I thought God would pardon him because he was doing a lot of charity and putting food on the tables of the needy and he had no obligation to do so.

The emphasis was on the Resurrection of Christ and history as a form of Revelation — which is also what led Heidegger back to Catholicism! — and importance was laid on ancient apolcalyptic texts, both Jewish and Christian. It was the latter that generated criticism.I have not read what exactly Professor Tipler wrote, however my doubt arises because he is a physicist, well-versed in theology.

He may therefore not have thought it necessary to wrap the cloth around the head.  What he may have done was to fold the cloth so that it would become more thick and thus more pressure could be applied. It would be more effective. It is a possibility.There is no general agreement about how the cloth was used on the face, not even in Spain. The pathologist and coroner I mentioned has limited information.Whatever, it is evident that this does not affect the perfect model produced by the professor of sculpture.","date":"December 1, 2015 at 1:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"},{"author":"louis","post":"The responses to questions 9 and 10 in the following interview are optimistic when it comes to Turin Shroud DNA, both plant and human.

That is in fact sort of echoed in Ian Wilson’s last Shroud book.We now know that Turin has brushed aside the proposals and the attention is focused on radiocarbon dating but, even then, they are hesitant to go forward. The reason can be read in the last q/r:https://www.academia.edu/11355553/Dr._Paolo_Di_Lazzaro_explains_his_research_on_image_formation_on_the_Shroud_of_TurinWith the recent Vatileaks scandals one notices that there is no lack of traitors, clerics included.Now, when it comes to dating ancient textiles, although the Masada excavation is still the object of controversy despite the good intentions of Y. Yadin, we at least know that the cloths found there were dated to AD 70.For more, the cloths used to wrap the Dead Sea Scrolls were also correctly dated. Note: By Willard Libby himself, around 1950. The results he obtained matched the studies made by Father Roland de Vaux. who excavated Qumran and was the first editor-in-chief of the Dead Sea Srolls.Radiocarbon dating is an important tool in deciding chronology in biblical archaeology and micro-archaeology will not change the picture. It is used together with C14:https://www.academia.edu/18994343/The_key_role_of_Biblical_Archaeology_in_Exegesis_An_Interview_with_Professor_Israel_FinkelsteinThat is why the questions in the thread “SSG member wants to know” are important.

You may have noticed that not many Catholics who go to church think in traditional terms. That is because they have learnt about developments in science, which seem to clash with what the Bible tells us. I have seen people giving up their faith overnight.There were attempts to get rid of the idea of Jesus’ resurrection: https://www.academia.edu/7471223/Jesus_was_not_buried_in_Talpiot_-_Part_IIIwhich were not taken seriously as they did not involve archaeologists but those in the film/documentary making indutsry..That much for New Testament archaeology, on which work is still being done.When it comes to Old Testament archaeology and the Bible things become worse:https://www.academia.edu/18994343/The_key_role_of_Biblical_Archaeology_in_Exegesis_An_Interview_with_Professor_Israel_FinkelsteinAs one who has also written on the science-theology dialogue, my guess is that we can go beyond physics and biology and cut the story short by deriving lessons from what we know about the findings in biblical archaeology.It is the only that way that systematic theologians can take the right direction. Right now many of them are so lost that hey keep on making vague assertions, confusing people even more.","date":"December 4, 2015 at 1:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/30/the-sudarium-a-better-provenance-and-history/","cat":"history","title":"The Sudarium:  A Better Provenance and History?"}]}
