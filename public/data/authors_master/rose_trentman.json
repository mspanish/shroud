Please accept my copy and paste of my response to Jane as it applies to you as well dear Senior!\nI felt your fear and I had to respond. Please believe me when I tell you, dying, for your consciousness which is in your SOUL is nothing but a breath… I can’t speak to what physical condition you may be in at the hour of your passing, but as for your “heart”, your “mind”, your soul, it is SO easy! You will surely laugh to yourself and say, “Are you kidding me? This is what dying is?” Seriously, it is easier than opening your eyes or taking a breath! DO NOT fear your physical death because LIFE is all about your spirit! That lovely vessel your soul resides in is just a body of flesh and is nothing more than a glove or sock you’ve worn all your physical life, that’s all. TRUST me, I have left my body and come back. It is NOTHING, and so easy, it’s the coming back into your body (if that is the plan) that is slightly uncomfortable.\nGod loves you dear one, trust in God, PRAY PRAY PRAY, you will have a whole crowd of loved ones waiting at your passing just to welcome you HOME and into the arms of Jesus. Heaven will no doubt be all we have been told and thousands and ten thousands fold more<3 I will see you there one day too! Look for me and tell me how right I was and then we will both laugh together! God Bless and have no fear dear friend in Christ.\nI also had feared death, but not for the pain or scariness of it, because I had already left my body before, but I had been worried I may not have enough time on earth because I too LOVE this BEAUTIFUL and amazing creation of Earth that our heavenly Father has given us, and I also LOVE my family and friends with a passion that could only come from God Himself.  I often have to ask God to not take offense at my requests to live a long (100+yr) life just so I can see it all and love as many people as I can.  BUT death, where is thy sting?  There isn’t any, as long as you are right with God that is.  I would never lie to anyone about this, passing on to the next dimension is a wonderful amazing experience and no wonder those who have did NOT wish to come back, even when they had a good life or loved ones still here, it’s THAT good!  NO FEARS, only LOVE.\nGod Bless you my friend in Christ <3<3<3\nI","date":"October 19, 2012 at 9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
