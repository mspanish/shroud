{"events":[{"author":"sal_t","post":"Joe, that is wonderful for starters.  Russ’s site is great.  Archive the videos there but use YouTube to make them public.  WMV files was probably the way to go in 2008. Not now. They need to be downloaded. I had to buy a special app to view an Ohio 08 presentation from Russ on my iPad. It took 30 minutes to get started. On my Dell laptop it took several minutes to download the file from Russ. Then I had to fire up the Windows Media app. What is your goal? Are you trying to drive traffic to Russ or share the videos with the public. Either way, your best strategy is to use YouTube and a good about write up with links to Russ. Set up a YouTube channel if you want to make it easy for users. Do it the easy way. Anyone can learn how in five minutes. Do it the effective way and put St. Louis on the map. Ask yourself why the Vatican, Vatican Radio, the Southern Baptist Convention, the United Methodist Church and all the others have YouTube channels. Look at http://tinyurl.com/k9kleka. It explains why to use YouTube for church media and not to use Vimeo or your own website. And it is free to do. No bandwidth issues. And look how good YouTube videos look in this blog. For the papers use academia.edu. Set up a Follow page like Emanuela Marinelli did.
