From each thread (which may have consisted of about 188 fibers in cross section, cf. the F15001 thread) he took 5 fibers: 1 from each end, 1 from the middle, 1 from the inside, and 1 at random (Adler at ca. 6:46). Of each fiber he made a FTIR spectrum and found a great deal of variability between even the 5 spectra from a single thread. \nThis can be explained. Adler wrote that each RC thread had an encrusted coating, looked scorched and waterstained, and had dirt deposits/microdebris (p. 94). Also, each would have had (ancient) cotton spun in (2-20%, Fanti, Rogers). So, the RC sample was practically homogeneous at thread level. But at fiber level there was much more variability, because a fiber from a single RC thread can be either:\n– cotton or linen\n– with a very thick, or very thin, or no coating\n– scorched or unscorched\n– with or without dirt deposit\nbecause a fiber can be either from the inside of the thread, from the outside of the thread, from the top of the weave, or from the intersections of the weave. This may vary even along the length of a single fiber.\nThe only-top-of-the-weave surface fibers from the main Shroud sticky-tape samples, on the other hand, “were removed from the tape, and their identity as to type verified”: Adler picked and cleaned 5 fibers of the non-image type, 4 of the waterstain type, 4 of the scorch type, 2 of the serum-coated type, 2 of the image type, etc. (p. 94). No wonder that the FTIR spectra of a type were identical. E.g., a chosen and cleaned non-image non-scorch non-waterstain fiber from the sticky-tapes, is only linen, with a very thin coating, unscorched and without dirt deposit. Of course there were spectral differences between the types.\nImportant is that the differences between the unchosen RC fibers were not very big: the spectra (p. 99) show that the threads were not entirely different from each other. They have roughly the same peaks, although of different relative intensities. Also the text doesn’t read the threads are different from each other, just that there is “more variation in the patterns” than in the non-image type (p. 96). Adler wrote: “There is insufficient evidence to conclusively demonstrate the presence of any adventitious linen in the radiocarbon sample area. … In fact, the FTIR data for the radiocarbon sample … shows physical characteristics of both the waterstain and scorch regions of the cloth” (p. 98). This corroborated that the RC area visibly belongs to a waterstain and scorch area: “you can tell by just looking at it” (Adler at 4:06-4:17).\nNow, a RC subsample that was RC dated, was not a fiber, not even a thread, but a piece of cloth, in which the variability among a thread’s fibers will have averaged out. So, the chemical variability at fiber level alone can not explain the strong linear trend shown by the twelve (thoroughly cleaned) pieces of cloth in the carbon dating. Only a substantial residue of carbon-containing handling dirt (inside the hollow fibers) that systematically varied over the twelve subsamples, might perhaps explain it. Or systematical irradiation …\n\n","date":"May 4, 2012 at 4:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/28/new-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Peer Reviewed Paper on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin."},{"author":"adrie","post":"The four authors’ article “Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin: Partially Labelled Regressors and the Design of Experiments” on http://www2.lse.ac.uk/statistics/research/RAFC04May2010.pdf has the same abstract as their April 2012 article. It says\n“We conclude …that there is a significant trend in the longitudinal coordinates”, \nand its final conclusion is:\n“Due to the heterogeneity of the data and the evidence of a strong linear\ntrend the twelve measurements of the age of the TS cannot be considered\nas repeated measurements of a single unknown quantity.

The strong linear trend in the twelve measurements suggests that the Shroud did not radiocarbon age homogeneously, but in way that systematically depended on the longitudinal distance of a certain subsample – one of the twelve – to some (central) location of the Shroud.\n\n","date":"April 28, 2012 at 2:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/28/new-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Peer Reviewed Paper on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin."},{"author":"adrie","post":"Thank you, John.\nAnother reason why the probability of a pseudo-Christ’s shroud is so small, is that the threads’ S-twist, the asymmetrically cut off corners, the image of a high priestly breastplate and perhaps seal indicate the Shroud was actually John Mark’s temple mantle, and noone elses.\nSee my articles on John Mark and the Shroud on http://www.JesusKing.info :\nhttp://jesusking.info/John%20Mark.pdf and\nhttp://jesusking.info/The%20seam%20and%20corners.pdf \nAnd who else than Christ would produce an irreproducible image, with no signs of putrefaction, but with blood stains that show no signs of removal of the corpse either: they are unaltered (without smears, and unbroken) and were in the right places before the image was.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2012 at 2:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers"},{"author":"adrie","post":"\nRon :WHAT?

The properties of the Turin Shroud used for its identification as a garment, and more specifically a priest’s garment, are its Pharisaic enlarged border and (cut off) corner fringes, its threads’ Syro-Palestinian sacerdotal Z-twisting, and its images of a Jewish high priest’s oval ornament under the chin and cylinder seal with its cord on the hands. The most outstanding biblical fact that identifies Jesus’ shroud as a priest’s garment is the beloved disciple’s belief that Jesus had risen because he saw the shroud rolled up and placed aside (Jo 20,7-8), just as a priest’s garment was always rolled up and place aside in the temple. \nA shorter article than the one Jabba mentioned, and more specific on the Shroud (18 pages), is: http://www.jesusking.info/The%20seam%20and%20corners.pdf .

And you’re right about the difficulty in discerning the image in low magnification as well.\nThese are the backlit photos of the Shroud http://www.shroud.com/gallery/pages/4X5FTA.htm http://www.shroud.com/gallery/pages/4X5DTA.htm (by “macroscopic scale” I meant ‘visible to the naked eye’). They show that some parts of the image are a bit darker than the background, for instance the abdomen and ventral thighs, but nowhere in the body image the net effect of oxidation+stars is a lighter image than the background, except perhaps at the four areas at the forehead, beneath a ventral knee, at the back of the head and next to a dorsal foot. But these lighter areas don’t constitute an image and seem to be artefacts of the light sources or wear. The book “The Orphaned Manuscript” has the backlit photo of the ventral side. It shows white borders around the burn patches and some white lines along the scorched longitudinal folds that are not visible in the online photo. \nI wonder if the back of the cloth was lighted uniformly. If the middle strip of the cloth received more backlight than the sides (and if the top and bottom parts of the image received more than the middle part of it), this might explain (at least partly) why the image is less visible than the light scorches and why only the middle part of the ventral image is visible.\nAdler said “In reflectance photographs the images of the waterstains, scorches, blood, and body images are all approximately of about the same intensity.” The text then has the two sentences about disappearance of the body image and the presence of the other marks in transmitted light (already quoted), and then follows a cryptic sentence: “In the reflectance mode the colored body image fibers produce 100% of the reflected radiation recorded, but in the transmitted mode they only contribute about 1% of the radiation recorded, thus demonstrating their superficial one-fiber-deep nature.” (Adler, Chemical and Physical aspects, p. 17). Pellicori wrote: “Figure 2 presents reflectances relative to background and normalized to ~1.0 at 700 nm for body image areas, scorches from the year 1532 fire, and bloodstained areas. […] A representative light scorch and a body stain have nearly the same color” (Spectral properties, p. 1915). Pellicori doesn’t discuss transmitted mode recordings of the Shroud, so perhaps the details, especially the (backlight-corrected) percentages for the light scorches, are in another STURP article, which I haven’t got…\nJohn Jackson recently said “the STURP examination clearly showed that the body image is only on the surface of the cloth, whereas the 1532 scorch mark discolorations at the same intensity of the body image discolor the cloth throughout its bulk.” link\nAntonacci probed the Shroud with a dissecting needle under a microscope and testified to “the discontinuous nature of the color and the extremely shallow penetration of the color into the cloth” (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers.pdf p. 12). I don’t know if anyone ever did this with a representative light scorch. BTW, in 1982 Rogers and Schwalbe wrote “With properly controlled heat and timing, superficial scorches can be produced on cloth without affecting the gross mechanical properties of the fabric” (Physics and Chemistry, p. 25).\n","date":"November 2, 2012 at 12:26 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/a-leisurely-thinking-aloud-appraisal-of-those-recently-released-shroud-photomicrographs/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"A leisurely, thinking-aloud appraisal of those recently-released Shroud photomicrographs."},{"author":"adrie","post":"Yes, I saw that theory (I saw all your postings), and that’s one of the reasons why I think you’re right about touched-up wounds.

Rogers incidentally found traces of starch fractions when “testing for sulfoproteins in blood areas” (Comments on, p. 13-14 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers.pdf). Here, the tested fiber was possibly from a blood/image area, but it was not necessarily a completely image-colored fiber. The detected starch fractions may have been present on a not-colored length of it, perhaps even under the blood. Rogers added: “we should have tested for starch”, so he didn’t do any specific tests for starch on specific fibers then. His later remark in Scientific Method (p. 30 http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogers2.pdf ) “The hypothesis on carbohydrate impurities is supported by observations of traces of some starch fractions on image fibers” gives no specification or reference.

A Maillard reaction can not do this: it can not transform starch. It can not color the primary cell wall either. VUV-irradiation can color the primary cell wall (Di Lazzaro et al.,  http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/DiLazzaroWeb.pdf), and probably also starch if it is less stable.\nI added this to my article “Internal selvedge … – No Maillard reaction” http://jesusking.info/Internal%20selvedge.pdf (new 4.2.4).

It just fluoresces less than the background. The UV-vis spectra of image and ‘red’ scorch are even almost the same:\n“When the photoelectric data are convolved with the scotopic response curve and normalized (Fig. 9), it becomes obvious that the background linen itself is responsible for the measured response of the blood and image areas, since there is an identical wavelenght characteristic. This agrees with the visual description. The curve for scorches having visual reflectance corresponding to that of image areas shows only a light weighting toward the orange region relative to the curves for body image, although the color difference is obvious to the eye and in the fluorescence photography. The explanation might be that the eye has an excellent ability to distinguish between colour differences when compared side by side.” (Pellicori, Spectral properties of the Shroud of Turin, Applied Optics, Vol. 19, No 12, 1980, p. 1919).\nSo, it is is not that the image formation should produce no fluorescence at all, it should only produce less fluorescence than it takes away. If the Shroud threads were wiped with starch paste at weaving just as you dabbed the linen with your finger, Hugh, touching only individual fibers, this might indeed explain some of the ‘half tone effect’ of the Shroud image.\n","date":"October 25, 2012 at 8:06 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature"},{"author":"adrie","post":"You guys sure are fast, I can only just keep up 🙂 (if this is good English)\nThis is the comment I made on The Other Site a while ago http://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/\nSo, Hugh, if you like, you might read my article http://jesusking.info/Internal%20selvedge.pdf  or the parts you think are useful now.

These margins at least contain:\n– many red iron oxide particles (from iron in water originally used for the retting of the linen. (H&A, A Chemical Investigation, p. 45-46, 50)\n– a higher concentration of calcium, compared to the almost uniform distribution on the cloth, implying it derives form the manufacture of the linen (Adler, Chemical and Physical, p. 23)\n– all sorts of debris, as all sticky tapes do.\nThe water stain margin at the edge of the Raes corner contained a higher concentration of salts than those in the rest of the Shroud (Adler, http://www.shroud.com/adler2.htm ).\nMy hypothesis is that the Shroud has a very thin film of starch that was dyed with an acidic dilute madder dye solution (pale yellow). A madder dye solution can be made by boiling dried crushed madder root in acidified water and/or by fermenting. (http://footguards.tripod.com/06ARTICLES/ART33_madder.htm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madder ).\nFirst-century Jews used vinegar for acidification of water (cf. the “vinegar” offered to Jesus on the cross Jn 19,29). Pliny talks about “some small drops of vinegar” (minimo aceti asperu) used in the water for making a fine starch paste. In Latin, acetum was sour wine, but perhaps sometimes lemon was used to acidify water.\nThe colorants of madder are the carbohydrates alizarin and purpurin, which fluoresce in the violet-blue and yellow-red. Together with the light blue fluorescence of the lignin in uncompletely bleached linen, they could explain the faint and mottled yellow-green background fluorescence of the Shroud.

At that temperature the cellulose may have only recrystallised: heat/warmth makes water escape from the cellulose and makes dislocations/defects in the crystal structure move to the edges of the crystal. Thus, the bulk of the crystal becomes more perfect and less brittle (this is called annealing in metallurgy). But the edges of the cellulose crystal, where the crystal is connected to its surroundings and where the dislocations concentrate, would become more brittle. This would be not only at the surrounding non-crystalline regions and at the (scorched) linen of the cylindrical primary cell wall, but also at the cell joints/‘growth nodes’, I think.\nAlso loss of water may have rendered the image fiber more brittle and make it break more easily, as linen “is a very durable, strong fabric, and one of the few that are stronger wet than dry” (Wikipedia). It seems possible/likely that a sealing coating of retrograded starch (end of this comment) still more or less protects the non-image fibers from drying/aging. Antonacci noted “the soft, pliable and excellent condition of the Shroud (a condition confirmed by STURP)” in his Reply to Rogers, p. 3. On image fibers, which look more corroded than non-image fibers (Adler), this sealing would have been disturbed/crackled by the image formation process, allowing water to escape faster from the linen, either immediately through heat that not scorched the celluse (at a glass transition temperature, well below 300C) or while aging after image formation.\nI’m very curious what you will discover with the microscope.

Thanks.\nReply: with pleasure Adrie. Here it is (I’ll read and, if need be, comment later):\nHere’s a comment to FAQ 15 on first-century features, and FAQ 13 on starch evidence:\nSTARCH\nBoth Kohlbeck and Rogers found starch in an image area and a non-image area. They both got a positive standard starch test (deep red) from non-image fibers. These fibers were from 14 Raes threads – not C14 threads –, which Rogers got from Gonella in 1979 (A Chemist’s Perspective, p. 64), and which I assume authentic and not part of a repair). Kohlbeck’s photo slide #42 shows that all ca. 15 fibers in view are completely red-brown; better visible on the third slide on this HSG-page (HSG password request form). Also McCrone and Adler independently reported the presence of starch on the Shroud. For details see Internal Selvedge, 2.2 and 4.2.1. Rogers found that the starch was insoluble in concentrated HCl = hydrochloric acid and that the coating completely surrounded all surface fibers of his Raes sample and even was sometimes inside the fiber, as if wiped on as a viscous paste (Scientific Method, p. 17-20, cf. my comment of Jan 3 and the SEM fiber cross sections in Brown, Microscopical Investigation, p. 7-8, and, if you like, Baldan’s SEM photos of Shroud fibers furnished by Riggi di Numana on Fanti’s homepage). So, the starch indeed did not have the shape of an uneven exsiccation layer or of a trace contamination. However, the use of a “warp sizing paste” of starch during weaving is not specific for the first century, for it is still used today (products 2-1 and 2-2). \nSAPONINS\nSaponins from Saponaria (soap-weed) is more specific for ancient technology. For some reason, Rogers didn’t search for saponins (the washing molecules) but only for certain hydrolysis  products of Saponaria saponins: reducing pentose sugars. He didn’t find them on non-image-non-scorch fibers (A Chemist’s Perspective, p. 40). Schwalbe&Rogers reported that saponins were not found by PMS (Physical and Chemical, p. 14), but PMS was not really done on controls – the only control was a Raes sample (PMS-paper, p. 2) which released early furfural, the Raes corner being a scorch area ( Internal Selvedge, 2.5.1.). On image or scorch fibers the saponins could or would have been broken down by image formation or scorching. So, in fact, we don’t know whether there are saponins on the background of the Shroud.\nSEAM AND STITCHING\nTechnique\n“Dr. Flury-Lemberg found the cloth’s finishing, at its hems, and in the joining seam to have been done using an unusual type of stitching very nearly invisible on one side, and as such closely resembling that of ancient Jewish textiles as found at Masada, the Jewish palace-fortress that was overthrown by the Romans in AD 73, never to be occupied again” (BSTS-newsletter 51). In the Proceedings of the 2000 Turin symposium, Flury-Lemberg shows a drawing of the type of seam (visible in Soons’ presentation, slide 11), and calls it ‘seam type Masada’: “Abb. 3 a Zeichnung: Nahttyp Masada” (Proceedings, p. 34). It might be described as a kind of rolled seam, secured with two lines of tiny overcast stitches. It is interesting that the ancient Egyptians specifically used two lines of overcast stitches to sew on a fringeless braid along an edge of a garment:\n “Only a limited range of structural details, such as seams and hems, were used in ancient Egypt. The most common of these were: simple hems, rolled and whipped hems, simple (open) seams, and lap-over seams. Other seams known from the Dynastic period include a form of run-and-fell seam and overcast seams (see Fig. 11.11), but these were rarely used on items of clothing. When a braid was added to a garment, one of several techniques was used, depending on the nature of the braid and the place where it was to be attached. If it was a fringed braid placed at the lower edge of a garment, it would normally be secured with one line of overcast stitching (e.g. Carter no. 367i; Cairo JE 62625). On the other hand, two lines of overcast stitching were used to sew on fringeless braids, whether along an edge of a garment or down the middle” (Ancient Egypt materials and technology, p. 282-283). \nThe type of seam for the Egyptian fringeless braids is not described or depicted, nor is the Masada-type seam among the depicted seams (Fig. 11.11, p. 283). The Egyptian mending stitches – whipped stitch and running stitch (p. 283) – are different from the non-whipped overcast stitches of the TS seam. Note that the cloth of the Egyptian braids were woven differently from the garment they were sewn on to, as they were meant to be clearly visible decorative elements ( p. 276, figure 11.6).\nMoment and reason of seam application\nX-ray photography showed “the absence of any evidence of any frayed thread ends along either side of the seam image”  and a “detailed thread matching” across the seam (Adler&Whanger, Concerning the Side Strip, with X-ray photos). Also Miller&Pellicori reported the near perfect match in UV, backlight and X-ray (Ultraviolet Photography, p. 85). Flury said that the seam was applied before the lateral hems were, and both were stitched by the same professional hand probably in a single operation (Proceedings 2000, p. 24). Also, the stichting was done from the backside of the cloth (the weft side, where also the hems are), in such way that on the front side the stitches are hardly visible and the seam is invisibly flat (p. 24-25). Moreover, the seam was already planned before weaving, for it is in an internally woven-in selvedge of warp threads that have spun-in cotton (Internal Selvedge, 2.1). The seam thus would have been made at manufacture. It wouldn’t have been a mending, or a rejoining of the two outer parts of the cloth from which an inner third strip had been removed, or even the adding of a decorative braid: it was merely done to have been done. This deliberate extraordinary procedure fits with the strict observance of the religious law of Nu 15,38, which in the Bible that was generally used in first-century Judea literally read that a margin (‘kraspeda’) had to be added to every robe (Nu 15,38 LXX). The first-century Gospel of Matthew says it was custom for Pharisees to “enlarge the borders (‘kraspeda’) of their garments” (Mt 23,5 KJV and WH).\nONE TIME DYE\nAs a yellow plant dye was found in the starch/starch gum coating (Scientific Method, p. 17-20), and Madder lake particles on the main Shroud (Internal Selvedge, 2.3 and 2.4), it is probable that the Shroud was starched, washed, and then dyed as cloth, without completely removing the starch first. The starch would protect the cloth from wear and tear, but it would not allow warm laundering the dirty cloth without removing the starch and dye together at once. Bleaching or laundering was not allowed for Jewish temple garments – they would simply be cut into wicks for the temple’s oil lamps (Mishneh Torah, Kli Hamikdasch 8, Halacha 4-5) – and the temple was destroyed in 70 AD.\nPETALON\n3D displays of the TS show a flat, more or less oval object beneath the chin, with protuberant marks that can be read as the Hebrew characters ayin-aleph-nun, almost similar to l  X  Y in Times New Roman characters (cf. the 1978 photo 210×250 pixels and its 3D display with isolines showing the flatness and the three protuberent characters). The object may be a ‘petalon’ (Ex 28,36 LXX): the distinctive petal-shaped golden ornament of the Jewish high priest (see third-century AD mural) and probably all members of the ruling Jewish Council, the Sanhedrin, consisting of 71 members. The characters l X Y may be the Hebrew numerals 7 and 1 and letter N, an abbreviation of “71 Nesiim” = 71 rulers. First-century historian Josephus said the petalon still existed in the first century (Jewish Antiquities 3,7,6 and 8,3,8). The Jerusalem Gemara (a 350-400 AD commentary on the Mishnah, a 220 AD written version of oral traditions dating from Pharisaic times = 536 BCE – 70 AD) said it was two fingers broad and reached from ear to ear and had protuberant letters (book Kli Hamikdash 9,1-2). Epiphanius said it was worn by James the Just, brother of Jesus (Panarion 29,4,4, p. 125), and Polycrates, stressing the Jewish origin of the Christian Passover date by referring to the evangelist John’s Jewish authority, said in 189-199 AD that the petalon was worn by the priest John the evangelist (Eusebius, Church History 3,31,3), apparently with a different inscription than the two words reserved for the liturgical high priest. The petalon with three letters would be exclusively first-century (6-70 AD), as before 6 AD the petalon was still only worn by the king and the high priest (Epiphanius, Panarion 29,3,3-6 p.124) and after 6 AD the Jews didn’t have a king anymore and the high priest’s liturgical petalon was kept locked up by the Romans (Jew. Antiq. 15,11,4 ad 18,4,3). After 70 AD Jerusalem was devastated by the Romans and there wasn’t a temple or Sanhedrin that ruled Judea anymore.\nA petalon on the Shroud would strongly associate it with Jesus, for no other crucifixion victim is known to have been buried in the presence of one, let alone two or three members of the Sanhedrin: Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus and John the evangelist. Only John – not Peter – believed Jesus had risen because he saw the shroud (his own temple mantle) rolled up and placed at the head end of the stone bench of the tomb, just as a priest’s temple mantle was always rolled up and placed at the head end of the stone bench in the dormitory of the temple (see my articles The seam and missing corners of the Turin Shroud as characteristics of John Mark’s temple mantle and John Mark – Author of the Gospel of John with Jesus’ mother).\n","date":"January 21, 2013 at 3:16 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres)."},{"author":"adrie","post":"I forgot to stress that the seam rejoins two sections cut from the same cloth (Flury, Proceedings Turin 2000, p. 24 and fig. 3 a, drawing and photo of open TS seam, of which the drawing is also in Soons’ presentation, slide 11).

They show deflecting streamers. The streamers are initiated by electrons, hitting air molecules/atoms, knocking out a free electron and leaving a positively charged ion behind. The positive ion and the negative electrons will subsequently preferrably move along the electric field line at the point of collision, but in opposite directions. When somewhere on its pathway one of the new free and electrostatically accelerated electrons collides with another air molecule, this molecule will in its turn ionise and produce a new free electron and ion, which start a new path way, in the direction of the field line at the point of this second collision. Then, somewhere on this new pathway a next collision will occur to the next air molecule, and so on. The glow of the corona is caused by electrons recombining with positive ions to form neutral atoms, which are not accelerated by the electric field (Mechanism of corona discharge).\nThe streamer is not a long continuous flow of molecules, but a chain of short pathways of separating and recombining ions and electrons along the local electric field line. The air pressure effects are minimal and wavelike: a corona discharge produces accoustic emissions.\nYour responses to Rogers’ FAQ-paper are thorough and in a way necessary, Colin.

The electrostatic field lines are not straight but curved lines that bend to the most protruding, most pointed points, also if these are threads or even fibers that are just slightly more protruding than others (see again fig. 5 p.7 of CD-paper). The geometry of the cloth surface determines the distribution of the “surface electrostatic stress (surface electric field intensity)” (CD-paper p. 4, points 3, 4 and 6) and therefore determines the distribution of the filamentary streamers of electric charge toward the cloth. Electrostatic field lines and discharge streamers are not the same as electromagnetic radiation that ‘fires’ along straight lines. Discharge streamers don’t penetrate the cloth either. In the CD model and experiments “The glow-CD layer is interrupted by the presence of the TS and re-starts on the outer surface of the TS” (CD-paper p. 9). Any discharge that hit the reverse of the Shroud would have come from the reverse side, from the outside of the doubled Shroud.\nIn a corona discharge, the accompanying UV luminescence is generated inside the streamer, also where it hits the cloth: it would not radiate from the body itself. A CD is also accompanied by heat and “aggressive chemical by-products” (CD-paper p. 18-19).\n","date":"January 10, 2013 at 1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2013/01/05/raymond-n-rogers-sturp-supremo-chemist-rip-who-sadly-lost-the-plot-due-to-an-apparent-blind-spot-it-would-seem-for-those-ultra-thin-and-highly-superficial-primary-cell-walls-of-flax-and-linen/","cat":"checker_illusion","title":"Raymond N Rogers: STURP supremo chemist (RIP) who sadly lost the plot (due to an apparent blind spot,  it would seem,  for  those ultra-thin and highly superficial primary cell walls of flax and linen fibres)."},{"author":"adrie","post":"Hi Yannick,  I took a closer look at Rogers’ answer to question #12 (http://shroud.com/pdfs/rogers5faqs.pdf ).

Some are lighter in both ordinary and UV light (e.g. at the bottom and around the broad tip of the stain), and one, around the narrow tip, is lighter only in UV (your contrast-enhanced close-up shows no lighter margin here, but zooming in on the UV photo, it does). This margin that is lighter only in UV, seems to be part of the red-orange stain in ordinary light, and could have been formed by orange plasma/serum (that flowed to the tip of the red flow during the post-mortem efflux). Serum is fluorescent (e.g. its minimal constituent lipofuscin fluoresces blue: 402 nm under 366 nm) and would have prevented fluorescence-quenching in image formation. Lighter margins in both UV and ordinary light could have been formed by\na)perhaps a very clear plasma/serum that prevented image formation (in that case the plasma/serum would be pre-image); a post-image painted-on ‘serum’ would not have created lighter margins in ordinary light.\nb)blood (or plasma) that flaked off (in that case the blood or plasma would have been pre-image and preventing image formation).\nc)a kind of ‘tenting effect’ (in that case the welt or elevated clot would be pre-image): electrostatic field lines ‘tent-away’ from concave surfaces such as those surrounding a welt or dry elevated blood clot, but concentrate on convex or pointed surfaces: see CD-paper, fig. 5 and especially fig. 13, which shows that the CD marks of concave hollows are light, and those of convex hills are dark with a light surrounding halo because of their concave margins; scorch tenting from a bas-relief would need the medieval artist to have made a welt or clot bas-relief on the wrist, and to have painted its dark mark red later.\n4) There is at least some separate plasma/serum on the Shroud. The sticky-tape sample of the narrow tip of the wrist blood (3EF) belonged to the tape set used for blood tests by Heller&Adler (A Chemical, Table 1). In this set, they found both red-particulate coated fibers (which particulates were non-birefringent) and gold-yellow coated fibers, and both coatings could be completely dissolved by proteases (Ibid. p. 40-41). On the gold fibers they got a positive Bromcresol Green test for serum albumin (Ibid. p. 40). I understand that in medicinal leeches the serum is excreted rapidly (your posting). The only scourge sample taken (1FB = “Image: Blood on Scourge Mark”, from one of the calves) did not belong to the set tested for blood by H&A.\nAs to the WordPress system: I don’t mind waiting for your approval.

There seems to be no “fibrinolysis” on a dead man, or even on a living man, within the “less than 40 hours” that the uncorrupted body would have been inside the cloth (Brillante, 2002, p. 1), and on hair or intact skin it is entirely impossible: \n“Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase are the agents that convert plasminogen to the active plasmin, thus allowing fibrinolysis to occur. t-PA is released into the blood very slowly by the damaged endothelium of the blood vessels, such that after several days (when the bleeding has stopped) the clot is broken down. This occurs because plasminogen became entrapped within the clot when it formed; as it is slowly activated, it breaks down the fibrin mesh.” (Fibrinolysis)\nDe Wesselow suggested that the blood on the head is postmortem blood that got released at the removal of the crown of thorns, and on the frontal side perhaps dripped from the crown unto the face and unto the hair that had already adhered because of dry clotted blood in it (The Sign, end of ch. 10).

I tried posting the comment again, and now I received the error message: “Duplicate comment detected; it looks as though you’ve already said that!” So, it’s probably on its way… The second post still would be enough…\n\n(ed: Adrie’s comment below has now arrived at last by email):\nHello Colin, \nThis is a late and long reply to your comment about essentially anaerobic conditions for a new scorch from under a heated template. I’ve been pondering on it as well, and thought that the ‘green’ scorches on the Shroud may have been aerobic, even though at the bottom of the reliquary, because the bottom layer of the folded cloth was only about half the length of the folded package. There was a furrow with oxygen-rich air under the cloth (see top right figure on p. 3 of G&S). The heated object scorched the upper layers “in an oblique manner” (G&S p. 2)  (probably initially aerobic, but when the object moved down more and more anaerobic), but when it reached the bottom layer it reached the furrow with oxygen and scorched the donut shaped marks with green fluorescence. The object couldn’t move further down, as it had reached the bottom of the reliquary, so any new lack of oxygen would not have resulted in replacement of the ‘green’ donuts by larger holes with ‘red’ scorch borders. And the reliquary at some point opened up, admitting the water that caused the small watermarks and eventually new air. Rogers’ book says that Pellicori reported that “the margins of the scorches fluoresced in the green, entirely different than the background of the Shroud”, but doesn’t give a reference (A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, p. 20). Pellicori’s observation would corroborate Miller’s experiments, in which the ‘red’ scorches were anaerobic, and the ‘green’ ones aerobic. “Modern linen can be artificially aged by baking at high temperature (125º-150º C) to the point where its reflected color and fluorescent emission approach those of the Shroud”; “a 5-h air bake at 150ºC. […] the time/temperature exposure used reproduces the color of the Shroud” (M&P, Ultraviolet fluorescence, p. 84; Pellicori, Spectral properties, p. 1916-17, 1919). Here Miller and Pellicori refer to the background color of the Shroud, so, the obtained visible color was lighter than that of the Shroud image, but the obtained green fluorescence was stronger than the fluorescence of the image: the image fluorescence is much less and peaks at a slightly longer wavelength than that of the background (Gilbert&Gilbert, Utraviolet-visible reflectance and fluorescence spectra, p. 1934). Adler wrote: “The background cloth shows a light greenish yellow emission not typical of other known old linen cloths and perhaps suggesting the presence of some type of thin coating of a fluorophore on the original linen” (Chemical and Physical Aspects, p. 13).\nRogers and Schwalbe wrote in 1982: “Miller and Pellicori produced light sources [sic] on modern linen in an atmospheric environment with a hot soldering iron. They found that scorches produced at various temperatures on both dampened and dry cloth all fluoresced yellow-green under ultraviolet radiation. Further experiments showed that the fluorescent compounds were quite water-soluble, although even after repeated rinsing, the scorched areas retained their fluorescent properties. In addition, they demonstrated the stability of the fluorescent compounds by baking the samples at 145ºC for six hours. Pellicori recalls that the Shroud image itself does not fluoresce measurably. In view of the results of these scorch studies, he feels that it is unlikely that the image was produced by scorching, for otherwise there should have been some characteristic fluorescent behavior observed. These results draw the “air” scorch hypothesis into serious question; however, it was chosen to leave the matter as an open question for now. Before the non-fluorescent property of the image is taken as conclusive evidence against scorch hypotheses generally, the conditions and reactions that are involved in the formation of these compounds must be better understood. Future studies should include many of Miller and Pellicori’s original experiments on actual Shroud threads” (Physics and Chemistry, p. 27).\nFURFURAL\nIn 2004 Rogers’ book revealed that furfural was found in Shroud scorches but not in image areas. “A positive Seliwanoff’s test for pentoses or furfural was obtained from scorched fibers of the main Shroud, while non-scorched non-image fibers gave a negative Seliwanoff’s test” (Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective, p.40). STURP’s sample mappings show that no tape samples were taken from the green donuts, three from light scorches, perhaps partly from their green margins, one from a light or dark scorch, and one from a dark scorch. Rogers: “If the image had been formed by a scorching-type, high-temperature reaction, some pyrolysis products of linen, including furfural, might still be present. The detection of pyrolysis products would have been fairly conclusive evidence for an image-formation mechanism; however, the absence of such products would prove nothing. I got no test with Bial’s reagent, so I also tried Seliwanoff’s test for furfural. […] I could not prove the presence of furfural on image areas; however, it was worth the effort to try” (Ibid. p. 39-40). \nRogers said furfural polymerises over time: “I also tried Seliwanoff’s test for furfural. It gives a nice, bright red color with furfural, but it gave no test with fibers from a light Shroud scorch. Furfural polymerises over time to form a dense, dark polymer that does not give the test. Polymerization is faster when the reaction is catalyzed with some common impurities, and it can be slowed with inhibitors. I could not prove the presence of furfural on image areas” (Ibid. p. 39-40). As he also said “A positive Seliwanoff’s test […] was obtained from scorched fibers of the main Shroud” (p. 40), an explanation Rogers deems possible for the absence of chemically detectable furfural in image areas is complete polymerisation there, as in one unspecified light scorch, but not in all scorch areas.\nThe question it raises is whether polymerised furfural fluoresces, and if so, which color. This liquid furfural absorption spectrum peaks at 92 nm, and this  furfural solution absorption spectrum peaks at 270 nm. For comparison, this (liquid) vanillin absorption spectrum peaks at 230 nm and from 280-320 nm, but this fluorescence emission spectrum of a vanillin solution under 360 nm UV excitation peaks at 425 nm (violet): “Fig. 3: […] The excitation wavelength was 360 nm. […] For comparison, the fluorescence emission spectra of 200 μM vanillin (spectrum d), 8 μM free enzyme (spectrum e), and […] are shown in B” (subscript of Fig. 3). Likewise, because a substance cannot emit a shorter wavelength than it absorbs, a furfural solution under 360 nm excitation would also have to fluoresce at longer wavelengths than 360 nm or equal to it. Such a spectrum would be comparable to the UV/Vis spectra of the Shroud made under 366 nm excitation, and to the photos taken under 335-375 nm excitation (Pellicori, Spectral properties, p. 1919). Then, furfural’s being embedded in scorched linen, and polymerisation of furfural, would change the molecular orbitals and their energy levels, so it would change the absorption and fluorescence wavelengths too. I suppose this change is toward longer wavelengths, as for example this absorption spectrum of a furfural and potassium biphthalate polymer (Fig. 12 c) shows it peaks at a longer wavelength than the spectrum of simple furfural (Fig. 12 a). This furfural-naphthol resin (fig. 4) emits a 680 nm red fluorescence under an “assigned excitation” of 680 nm (table 1). And these “carbon dots” of polymerised and aromatised furfural compounds – a “furan resin” (p. 2) – strongly fluoresce blue under 405 nm violet excitation and green under 488 nm blue excitation (photos p. 11-12). Mere furan, the fluorescing ring in all these substances, absorbs from 200-230 nm when liquid.\nSo, furfural in linen, also polymerised furfural, does fluoresce and might fluoresce green or perhaps even red (as I see it now, but I’m not a chemist). As there are red fluorescing scorches (with green-yellow margins) in the image area (Adler, Chemical and Physical aspects, Fig. 2), only a fluorescence quencher that was applied after image formation and removed by the 1532 AD scorches might explain the absent/weaker fluorescence of the image, but this seems improbable (but again, I’m not a chemist).\nWhen trying to prove that the Raes/radiocarbon sample was from a repair in the main Shroud, Rogers wrote that the anearobic pyrolysis mass spectrometry data of five different image areas showed no early furfural release (it appeared only when hydroxymethylfurfural appeared, or near to that, “For example, figure VIII-3 shows a mass spectrum that was taken when the first decomposition products started to appear over a sample of image fibers.” Rogers, A Chemist’s p. 54; Fig. VIII-3 is Fig. 1 in Pyrolysis/Mass Spectrometry; furfural is at m/e 96, HMF at 126), whereas the (lightly scorched) Raes sample did show early furfural release without HMF: “furfural appears relatively early, and it disappears quickly” (Rogers, A Chemist’s, p. 57, and Fig. VIII-4 which is Fig. 2 in the online PMS article). That the Raes corner is lightly scorched is shown by\n1. its fluorescence (Antonacci, 2005, p. 5-6: “After studying ultraviolet fluorescent photographs taken of the Shroud, STURP’s chief photographer Vernon Miller and Alan Adler confirmed over 15 years ago that the radiocarbon site was in the midst of a scorch mark and at the edge of a water stain.”)\n2. the FTIR data of the radiocarbon sample having scorch characteristics (Adler, Selzer and DeBlase, Further Spectroscopic, p. 98)\n3. its positive Bial’s reagent test for furfural/pentoses (Rogers, A Chemist’s, p. 39)\n4. its starch gum coating – not gum Arabic for lack of proteins (Rogers, Scientific Method, p.17-20 – Adler, p. 4).\nThe Raes thread’s early release of furfural without HMF could be explained by it having been scorched at a temperature above the pyrolysis threshold of hemicellulose (which produces furfural from xylose) but below the pyrolysis threshold of cellulose (which produces HMF from glucose), i.e. below ca. 315ºC, as you suggested in this blogpost (see also these TGA pyrolysis curves of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin; btw “lignin was more difficult to decompose, as its weight loss happened in a wide temperature range (from 160 to 900 °C) and the generated solid residue was very high (∼40 wt.%)” Fuel article).\nNote that not even one irrefutable scorch sample from the main Shroud was tested with PMS: the tested 6BF sample is classified as “light scorch” by Rogers (PMS article, p.2), but is called “Blood Flow (Approx. Test Point)” by the STURP sample list, and “Blood image, front, lance area” by Heller&Adler, who called sample 6AF, taken a bit closer to the scorch than 6BF, “Blood-scorch image margin” (A Chemical Investigation, p. 49). Assuming that Rogers managed to find a lightly scorched fiber on sample 6BF – distinguishable by a scorched medulla (Scientific Method,  p. 8-9) –, it would have showed the simultaneous furfural and HMF release (or perhaps even later furfural release if polymerised) of a linen fiber scorched above 315ºC (all its hemicellulose plus overabundant cellulose being scorched), for in his comparison of all tested samples, including the one from the “Edgerton modern” linen, which was lightly scorched by ironing, and then bleached again (Rogers on Maillard reaction, p.3), Rogers doesn’t talk about temperatures anymore, but only says that among all “product ratios” (furfural/HMF) the Raes sample “was unique” (PMS article, p. 6). In fact, Rogers doesn’t give any absolute temperature.\nAnyway, for testing the scorch hypothesis the question is: could a very high degree of furfural polimerisation in image fibers have retarded its furfural release to near that of HMF from unscorched cellulose? For the above mentioned furfural polymer (“a furfural and potassium biphthalate-based resin”) “The highest temperature at which the polymer melting process occurred was found to be 202.01 °C, which far exceeds the boiling point of pure furfural (161.7 °C)” (par. 3.1.7.). So, it seems the answer is: yes, it might perhaps have retarded the furfural release that far. But then, the furfural polymer would probably still be fluorescent…\nRECAPITULATING\n1)     Anaerobic model (red fluorescence): (red) Shroud scorches with the same visible color as the image fluoresce red, even in the image area, while the image doesn’t fluoresce noticably. So, sensitising the cloth is no option in the anaerobic model. An ‘image-only’ fluorescence quencher to explain the difference seems improbable. Assuming it’s not there, the scorch image would have to have lost its fluorescence, by oxidation or evaporation, in 200 or more years after having kept some or all of it in 500 years. Anaerobic Shroud scorches fluoresce red + anaerobic PMS of linen produces furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural + furfural is fluorescent (and HMF probably too because of its furan ring) => furfural and/or HMF in scorched linen probably fluoresces red. The image doesn’t contain free furfural or HMF, while some light Shroud scorches do contain furfural. So, the image would have to have lost its free furfural. Rogers says furfural would rather polimerise than disappear by oxidation or evaporation, but polimerised furfural probably fluoresces.\n2)     Aerobic model (green fluorescence): the Shroud image fluoresces much less and a slightly warmer color than the ‘greenish’ background. On pure non-fluorescing modern linen the Shroud’s visible image color cannot be reproduced immediately without producing green-yellow fluorescence (Hugh 1). This fluorescence even appears at lower temperatures than a visible scorch color (Hugh 2). The green scorch fluorescence doesn’t disappear with aging (air-baking/500 years). As air-baking/scorching produces green fluorescence ánd simulates aging, aging would rather intensify green scorch/age fluorescence. So, a scorch image should never have had green fluorescence (or at least scorching should have produced less than it took away). Pure linen becomes green fluorescent by air-baking above ca. 125ºC (M&P and Hugh 3). To produce a Shroud-like image color without (too much) green fluorescence one might use a sensitiser, as possibly present on the Shroud, and scorch below a certain temperature, perhaps below ca. 125ºC. But, as air-scorching and aging are basically the same process, in the centuries of aging the scorch would always be ahead of the background in this process, and have more green fluorescence than the background, until some kind of saturation takes place. Only a relatively strong cool-fluorescent coating would allow a scorch to take away this fluorescence and have a permanently weaker and warmer fluorescence than the background.\nAm I mistaken somewhere…?\nAn alternative for a low temperature contact scorch is a (low temperature) electrostatic discharge (aka corona discharge or St. Elmo’s fire). Its image is dark/light-inverted, 3D-encoded, and superficial, as the Shroud image link1, link2, link3, link4, link5). The fourth article concludes: “From the IR results, we can say that C-O-C and C-O bonds are produced when CD is present and C-H bonds disappear. We propose that a kind of slow combustion process occurs during CD that forms the image on linen” (p. 2589). It is said that a new CD image, that still has to become visible by aging/air-baking, has a “lack of fluorescence” compared to the blue fluorescing background of “new, but not bleached linen”, i.e. “manufactured as the old linens were” (link2, p. 17; link1, p. 12; cf. link1, p. 9 fifth -, and p. 19 at 1), but its image fluorescence does look green-yellow (see link1, Fig. 15).\nIt seems that a very light aerobic contact scorch and a CD are mutually not all that different in terms of fluorescence. After an initial inversion from the relatively strong blue linen background fluorescence to the weaker green-yellow fluoresence of the ‘undeveloped’ CD image, the developed visible image would later, after air-baking or aging, probably have a stronger green fluorescence than the background. In that case, also a CD would need a cool-greenish fluorescent coating to explain the weaker and warmer fluorescence of the image when compared to the background after centuries of aging. \nPOLISHED STARCH-MADDER COATING\nA coating of retrograded starch including a dilute acidic Madder dye (as batch-uniforming color and optical brightner) might keep most of its fugitive fluorophores alizarin and purpurin, if it was glazed by firmly rubbing it with a glass ball or slickstone, such as this Viking-type linen smoother or the Dutch smoothing balls from the 8th and 9th centuries (“bollen uit de 8e en 9e eeuw”), to render it more dense and sealing, and thus dirt repellant and lustrous. Number B14 of the Shroud evidence list says “The TS linen has a lustrous finish (Rogers, 1978-1981).” This is another corroboration for the Shroud being a robe as Herod’s ‘estheta lampran’ (Luke 23,11 WH), literaly “shining robe” (Bible in Basic English), “brilliant robe” (HCSB), “glistening clothing” (LEB), also translated as “white cloak” (WYC) and “kingly robe” (NCV) (BibleGateway). The sealing starch finish would also have retarded the aging of the very tightly woven linen Shroud (evidence B5). Saponaria Officinalis, also called struthium, was not detected on the Shroud: “I could not prove that the cloth had been washed in S. Officinalis. Only the fluorescence evidence remains to suggest the use of struthium” (Rogers, A Chemist’s, p. 40), but Madder was chemically detected on the Raes sample (which isn’t a repair) inside the coating and as lake particles, and microscopically recognized as lake particles on the main Shroud (Internal selvedge in starched and dyed temple mantle, par. 2.3 and 2.4 (updated)).\n","date":"November 13, 2012 at 10:58 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/thibaults-principle-true-for-a-stepped-template-maybe-but-not-an-artistic-bas-relief-with-rounded-contours-and-gentler-relief/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Thibault’s Principle: true for a stepped template, maybe – but not an artistic bas relief with rounded contours and gentler relief"},{"author":"adrie","post":"Hello Colin, \nJust now I tried to post a very long comment, twice, but they didn’t appear.

The scorches associated with the fire of 1532, during which the Shroud was involved, attest to the rapid consumption of the available oxygen. Their reddish emission is probably due to furfurals, which can be produced under such conditions. Linen lightly scorched by a soldering iron in air shows the green-yellow emission, often distributed in plumes of deposited pyrolysis products. We demonstrated in one experiment that the material of the plumes could be transported by water, but the underlying scorched cellulose retained a bright yellow-green fluorescence.” (Miller, V.D., and S.F.

Re 3: Miller&Pellicori reported non-fluorescing scorches (or stains resembling scorches): “There is a series of holes through the Shroud cloth (through which the reinforcing backing cloth sewn to the Shroud after the fire can be seen). The densely burned borders of these burned holes show no emission. Where the more lightly scorched material matches the appearance of other scorched areas (around patches, for example), the fluorescent appearance is quite different, that is, no emission is seen. The different appearances might relate to different generation mechanisms. […] around the patches, the scorches display shading in red emission. These scorches appear different from the burn holes.”(Ultraviolet fluorescence photography of the Shroud of Turin, p.77, fig 5 dorsal area B-E, 4-6). I don’t know whether they mean the so-called ‘poker holes’ or the tiny holes visible in the middle of the buttocks area.\nIn the next area: “Two small circular stains at C-7 and D-7 are mirror images and visually resemble weak scorches. In fluorescence these stains are absorbing.”(p.79, fig 6 dorsal midsection area B-E, 7-9)\nIn still another area: “Scorches show red fluorescence except for those associated with the sets of three holes which have heavily burned borders. Plumes of pyrolyzed materials pointing toward the feet are seen associated with the burned holes. At 19 the plume pointing toward the hands fluoresces red. Some shading from red to yellow fluorescence can be seen.”(p.82, fig. 9, ventral hands and thighs B-E, 16-19). Here the three ‘poker holes’ are definitely meant.

Legrand thought about incence causing them, Flury-Lemberg about concentrated acid (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/aldo4.pdf p. 9). The acid idea has been contested, says Barta (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n56part6.pdf p.1) (I read this contestation once, somewhere, but didn’t bookmark it). Rogers said the borders looked like pitch, but did no chemical analysis; “his term “pitch” was intended to apply to pine sap or something of a balsamic origin” (http://www.shroud.com/restored.htm ). “The hypothesis that these holes were burned through with a hot poker is probably incorrrect. Close inspection of the peripheral areas reveals a foreign material there, resembling pitch. The radiographs also show high density structures that supports this observation. This earlier damage may have resulted from burning pitch that perhaps fell onto the Shroud from a torch.” Schwalbe, L. A., and R. N.

It can easily wait a couple of days. Have a nice trip!\n\n(ed: here is the comment that Adrie sent that was apparently rejected by WordPress software on account of its length. I’m copying and pasting it from his her email that I have finally been able to open, now I’m back on my own laptop):\n\n“It seems to me that furfural in scorched linen isn’t comparable to a fluid that evaporates. In newly scorched linen furfural is ‘in solution’ in its surrounding other pyrolysis products and other non-pyrolysis products (all organic substances), and there, its very reactive aldehyde group would sooner or later polymerise with them. I found  a number of  quotes about furfural evaporation, showing that it is most prominent when furfural is in water or is a pure fluid on/in moist soil, and less prominent and even uncertain when it is a fluid on/in dry soil (which would contain little organic material): “With the water vapor can be volatile, benzene aldehyde odor” (Chinese entry); “Furfural is produced from annually renewable agricultural sources /containing pentosans[…] In all processes, raw material is charged to the digestor and treated with strong inorganic acid. High pressure steam is introduced through the mass and, after attaining operating temperature and pressure, furfural is steam distilled”; “If released to soil, furfural is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 40. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry’s Law constant of 3.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Furfural may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure”, “Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound’s estimated Henry’s Law constant” (PubChem, Methods of Manufacturing; Environmental Fate and Exposure Potential).\nSo, in dry scorched linen, containing only carbohydrates and other organic material, furfural would evaporate (at best) slowly and have the chance to polymerise immediately. Furfural “Forms condensation products with many types of cmpd, phenol, amines, urea, etc” (Ibid., Chemical and Physical Properties; condensation is polymerisation by losing a small molecule).\nAs regards the speed of polymerisation: Rogers said that after a “burn test” on modern linen “Condensed cellulose pyrolysis products form an intensely fluorescent ring around the center of heating” (Scientific Method, p. 3-4, caption fig. 2). He meant ‘cellulose’ that had been pyrolysed and then had chemically condensed. In the text he speaks about “the chemically reducing and reactive pyrolysis products (formaldehyde, furfural, organic acids, CO, etc.)” (p. 4). Here Rogers’ use of “cellulose” and “furfural” should include hemicellulose and hydroxymethylfurfural. (Besides, it seems to me the fluorescent ring was scorched aerobic.) Anyway, Rogers here says polymerisation/condensation of furfural takes place very soon after scorching (not only after decades of evaporation), and that such a polymerisation doesn’t inhibit fluorescence.\nAlso, furfural’s chemical structure shows that furfural after polimerisation by bonding at its aldehyde group would still fluoresce. The aldehydegroup of furfural is its only difference with furan, which has just a single hydrogen atom instead of the aldehyde group. The ring of furfural is equal to the ring of furan, and this ring has only two double bonds. So, as furan fluoresces, a furfural polymer, having changed or lost its complete aldehyde group but still having this same furan ring, would also fluoresce. At least some furfural polymers, bonded by furfural’s aldehyde group, fluoresce measurably, such as the furfural-biphthalate resin: its chemical structure shows a resin of furfural bound by its aldehyde group (Scheme 2). Its fluorescence is a bit weaker than that of pure furfural, but still much stronger than the hardly fluorescent biphthalate (Fig. 12). Also in the furfural-naphthol resin the aldehyde group of furfural has bonded to naphthol (Scheme 3), and then there was condensation of the naphthol-furfural molecules at the oxygen atom of the (former) aldehyde group, so, also here the furan ring has been preserved (Scheme 5). This “condensed furfurylol Naphthol pigment” fluoresces and, as its relative intensity is stronger than that of mere naphthol (Fig. 4), the furan ring still contributes to the fluorescence of the polymer.\nRED FLUORESCENCE\nSo, from the above, it seems that furfural in scorched linen polymerises before evaporating, and it is certain that polymerised furfural still fluoresces. But, in order to not only search where the light is, let’s assume there are more fluorophores in anaerobic scorched linen than only the furan-type. The question then is, whether the furan-type causes the red fluorescence of the anaerobic scorches.\nFurfural is produced in an anaerobic (= red) scorch/pyrolysis (PMS article, p. 2) and was detected in Shroud scorches, probably red (= anaerobic) ones (Seliwanoff’s test, A Chemist’s, p. 40). Pellicori, Rogers, and Soran, implicitly said furfural fluoresces red: “The fluorescence in the scorched areas is apparently due to the furfural pyrolysis products. (R.N. Rogers and D. Soran, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories; personal communication” (Spectral properties, 1980, p.1919). Miller and Pellicori wrote “The scorches associated with the fire of 1532, during which the Shroud was involved, attest to rapid consumption of the available oxygen. Their reddish emission is probably due to furfurals, which can be produced under such conditions”, and also wrote “The visually dark-brown burns fluoresce brownish-red. The color reddens as the scorch density decreases. Comparable to pyrolysis products, produced under limited oxygen combustion, such as furfurals” (Ultraviolet fluorescence, 1981, p. 84, 75). The chemist Heller finally did declare that Miller’s experiment “with burning linen in a limited-oxygen atmosphere had produced a furfural-type material, which fluoresced in the ultraviolet. This jibed with the ultraviolet reflectance spectra of the Shroud of Turin” (Report on, 1983, p. 175). So, according to Pellicori, Rogers, Soran, Miller, and Heller a furfural/furan-type material in anaerobically scorched linen fluoresces red or comparable to red.\nIf furfural doesn’t cause the red fluorescence of the Shroud scorches, there would have to be a stronger red fluorescence of another unknown fluorophore produced by anaerobic pyrolysis of linen. In order to produce “highly fluorescent carbon dots” from “hydrothermally treated” orange juice the fluorescent products (“Furfural like compounds, aldehydes, ketones”) were separated from the non- or less fluorescent  products (“Acetic acid, Lactic,  Propenoic, Levunilic and formic acid”) (p. 1-2, Fig. p. 2): “The aqueous solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min to separate the less-fluorescent deposit” (p. 1). When discussing the PMS of linen, Rogers said “The major products of the thermal decomposition of cellulose and other carbohydrates in the absence of oxygen are formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, furfural (2-furaldehyde), hydroxymethylfurfural (5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde), levulinic acid (4-oxopentanoic acid), and 3-pentenoic--anhydride” (PMS article, p. 2). Except the furfural-types, non of these have rings, let alone aromatic rings (except perhaps the 3-pentenoic--anhydride, which chemical structure I haven’t found, but which is probably similar to pentanoic-anhydride, which is not a ring). So, these other products probably wouldn’t be (strongly) fluorescent. Levulinic acid was indeed separated as less fluorescent than furfural in the carbon dots production. Either formaldehyde (“formaline\nsolution 37%”) or a “Formaldehyde pigment” fluoresces or both do (note the inconsistencies between table 1 and fig. 4), but if formaldehyde fluoresces it apparently doesn’t fluoresce enough to be detectable by its fluorescence without this “fluorogenic dye”. Besides, formaldehyde, having only one double bond, would fluoresce less than formic acid, which has two double bonds and fluoresces less than furfural (see carbon dots production). The five-carbon-plus-one-oxygen rings from pyrolysed xylan/hemicellulose, that you showed, only have one double bond, and thus probably don’t fluoresce stronger than furfural either.\nSo, it seems to me that it is very likely that the red fluorescence of the anaerobic Shroud scorches is caused by their detected furfural-type fluorophore. \nSCHEMATIC SUMMARY\nAn anaerobic scorch produces a) red fluorescence and b) furfural that c) fluoresces red. The red fluorescence (a) and the furfural (b) don’t disappear in 500 years, and furfural will always fluoresce, also when polymerised (c), and most probably causes the red fluorescence of the Shroud’s anaerobic scorches. The image has neither red fluorescence (a) nor detectable furfural (b) nor polymerised furfural for lack of red fluorescence (c).\nThe image has a reflectance of the same visible color and intensity as anaerobic scorches, and in some areas is replaced by them, so,\n1) a sensitizer – which lowers the temperature at which the chromophore can be produced –\nwould have affected image and scorch equally and thus, by itself, can’t explain the different fluorescence and furfural content\n2) an ‘image-only’ fluorescence quencher – i.e. that can be removed by scorching –, even if it existed and had been applied, wouldn’t explain the different furfural content\n3) if the chromophore can be produced anaerobically (perhaps even latently) at a lower temperature than that at which the fluorophore furfural is produced, a lower anaerobic pyrolyis temperature and longer pyrolysis time for the image might produce the image’s different (less red) fluorescence and (lower) furfural content in combination with a visible color and intensity equal to that of the red scorches. But even then, to be consistent with the Shroud, both the image-scorches and the red 1532 AD scorches should also have a much weaker and slightly warmer fluorescence and darker visible color than the background after centuries of aging.\nREMAINING QUESTIONS\nStill complex. I wish I knew what is the green-yellow aging-fluorophore and how its production depends on temperature/time. And it would be great to know if anaerobic scorching takes away (some of) the light blue fluorescence of lignin, and also to know the temperature/time dependency of this process, and also that of the loss of blue fluorescence in aerobic scorching.\nOn the other hand, PMS did not detect lignin in Shroud samples (not only single fibers from the main Shroud but also “Raes fibers” = “ample material from the Raes sample”,  and from the main Shroud’s ‘Zina thread’, see A Chemist’s, p. 57, PMS article p. 2, and Studies on, p. 192). But the same PMS did detect lignin in modern-primitive linen: “Mass spectrometry […] There is a significant difference between the Shroud and the modern-primitive samples. The latter were found to contain lignin” (Physics and Chemistry, p. 14). Also microchemical spot tests for vanillin (present in and slowly disappearing from fresh lignin (Scientific Method, p. 16), did not detect vanillin in Shroud samples (“No samples from any\nlocation on the shroud gave the vanillin test”, Studies on, p. 191), but “The Holland\ncloth and other medieval linens gave a clear test” (Ibid. p. 190). Nevertheless, the peak at ca. 435 nm of the fluorescence spectra of lignin solutions probably under 337 nm excitation (p. 10, and p. 3, Fig. 1; “337 nm was used as an excitation source for the experimental data shown in FIGS. 2 and 3”) coincides with the peak at ca. 435 nm of the fluorescence spectra of all Shroud samples, especially those of the background: “Figure VIII-2: Spectral fluorescence of four clear areas of the Shroud with excitation at 365 nanometers. Maximum fluorescence is at about 435 nanometers” (A Chemist’s Perspective, p. 51) ; “When the photoelectric data are convolved with the scotopic response curve and normalized (Fig. 9), it becomes obvious that the background linen itself is responsible for the measured response on the blood and image areas, since there is an identical wavelength characteristic” (Spectral properties, p. 1919).\nAbsence of lignin and of its fluorescence would lead us back to (the necessity of) a fluorescent coating on the Shroud (cf. comment Nov. 13). The  absorption spectrum of alizarin – the main colorant of Madder – also has a peak at ca. 435 nm, and “For many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum. This is known as the mirror image rule.”\n","date":"November 20, 2012 at 6:40 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/thibaults-principle-true-for-a-stepped-template-maybe-but-not-an-artistic-bas-relief-with-rounded-contours-and-gentler-relief/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Thibault’s Principle: true for a stepped template, maybe – but not an artistic bas relief with rounded contours and gentler relief"},{"author":"adrie","post":"Hello Colin,\nAgain I tried to post a comment that is too long for posting directly.
