{"researchers":[{"id":"comment-1747","author":"phyzics","post":"Dan, Kind of an off topic that relates to John Jackson. In 2008 he published a paper, “A New Radiocarbon Hypothesis” where he claims that the re weaving hypothesis is discredited because of “evident bandings in the 1978 radiographs and transmitted light images of STURP”. The whole article can be found at shroud.com in their scientific articles section. My question is: is there any validity to what he is saying, or was he mistaken (this paper is 2 years old after all and he may have misunderstood the various techniques used to confirm the re weave hypothesis). Hope to hear from you, and thanks. Great site by the way, good to see objective reporting on the Shroud..","date":"2010-11-19","mins":"3:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/11/19/john-and-rebecca-jackson-starting-shroud-of-turin-school/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"John and Rebecca Jackson Starting Shroud of Turin School"}]}
