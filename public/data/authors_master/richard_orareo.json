Reverse your logic; the sculptor used the shroud as a model for his sarcophagus.  There is no need to manipulate time, space, or the cloth.  The artist simply copied the image to his sculpture.\n\n","date":"February 21, 2015 at 1:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/21/a-bas-relief-match-to-the-shroud-of-turin-image/","cat":"art","title":"A Bas Relief Match to the Shroud of Turin Image?"}],"image":[{"author":"richard_orareo","post":"Msgr.

We have not had a formal opening as yet; but it is nearly ready.  The interior restoration is complete and the exterior is just starting. to be worked on.  I expect completion will be a month or so away.  We had a tornado touch down in the neighborhood; and lost about 15 trees, the clean-up is also nearing completion.  As close as we are, we are not there yet.\nI will let you know,\nRichard\n\n","date":"September 12, 2013 at 9:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/12/the-wabash-shroud-of-turin-museum/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Wabash Shroud of Turin Museum"}],"resources":[{"author":"richard_orareo","post":"Dan, In reply to John Klotz reporting on David Sox speaking about the faith of Fr. Rinaldi,  I doubt that Fr. Rinaldi ever relied on the shroud as the basis of his faith.  He repeatedly said that one’s faith should NOT be based on the shroud,  belief in the shroud would enhance one’s faith.   Further,  Sox would have been referring to the early, unauthorized carbon 14 test that reported a fifth century result.  At that time Fr. Rinaldi was concerned about the faith of the shroudies who relied on the shroud as the basis of their faith.  Those of us who were with Dorothy Crispino at her home when Fr. Rinaldi called from Turin to inform us of the result of that C14 test can attest to that call and its content.  I spoke with him on that call!

Since then having met many shroudies, American and European, attended many conferences and having seen the Shroud at all exhibitions since 1978.  It has been a life changing experience thanks to John Walsh.  He epitomized the melding of scholarship and faith, stressing the need for scientific exactitude and historical accuracy.  His creativity was wide-ranging and enlightening; a master of his craft.  Thank you John.\nRichard Orareo\n\n","date":"March 30, 2015 at 2:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/30/rip-john-evangelist-walsh/","cat":"books","title":"RIP John Evangelist Walsh"}]}
