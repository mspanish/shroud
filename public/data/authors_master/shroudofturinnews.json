Episcopalian no one shall no the hour or day of Christ’s Return. I believe you might of taken the “The End of World” article wrong. No, we our not like Harold Camping and his teachings. Maybe I should of written the Title “The Return of Christ”. We do believe that Christ’s Return is near and that He his about to change the world for the greater.
