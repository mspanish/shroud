Very plausible. The application of the limestone/Malky dust is the key to the lensing affect. According to skeptics, the application of the (alkaline) substance on a conducive substrate (3 to 1 herringbone cloth) allows  halftones to be created.  The image can not be continuos tone, thus AM frequencies and screening values. Kohlbeck explained the image was a mercerization process and Dr. Nitowski used ammonia present in urea to create an image with a manikin inside a lime stone tomb.

Do you believe that the image is random stochastic FM screening or AM screening? Looping the original prints of the 16×20 black and white image of the Enrie photo I see a prism (a Term we use for Lines Per Inch varying screen angles for security printing. Ours are set at 135º converging with another at 45º). The image formation is represented by dots per inch. (low resolution dots per inch since it is less than news print). My own interpretation of this image, I would explain that the Shroud is consistent with AM screening of LPI and DPI with varying frequencies. This image mechanism is why it produces such a good 3D rendition. I don’t believe we can get the same results if the Shroud was an image mechanism of random high resolution FM screening.","date":"June 17, 2014 at 12:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/17/photomicrographs-and-stochastic-imaging/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Photomicrographs and Stochastic Imaging"},{"author":"hsg","post":"When you say varying threshold, are you talking about the herringbone weave’s in and out pattern which creates depth? or are you talking about frequency densities?","date":"June 17, 2014 at 1:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/17/photomicrographs-and-stochastic-imaging/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Photomicrographs and Stochastic Imaging"},{"author":"hsg","post":"Good point David, “If one prefers the 1st century provenance theory, then we may have an inkling as to why no such other burial images have been found over time.

Eastman Kodak’s engineers along with Phil Larock Kodak digital imaging photographer concluded that the banding was the attributed  to the cloth’s converting mirror frequencies. (I believe that was Hughs’ assertion too).Guest posting by OK, is a sound article, however, questions of human’s ability to create a negative image (Thermomechanical process for example) can be argued.  Another interesting factor discussed a few years ago from my LinkedIn “science group of color specialist” asserted that the cloth hemming-bone weave pattern was crucial to the image if lennsing was attributed to the formation. If the Shroud was made from a traditional 2-1 weave, apparent edge sharpness would be lost. Human observation may have played a roll in selecting a  3-1 weave pattern to create the image.So many mysteries, and when all said and done, we may never know.","date":"November 10, 2014 at 9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/10/guest-posting-by-o-k-on-the-shroud-as-a-negative/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting by O.K. on the Shroud as a Negative"}]}
