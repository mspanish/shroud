Very plausible. The application of the limestone/Malky dust is the key to the lensing affect.

Do you believe that the image is random stochastic FM screening or AM screening? \nLooping the original prints of the 16×20 black and white image of the Enrie photo I see a prism (a Term we use for Lines Per Inch varying screen angles for security printing. Ours are set at 135º converging with another at 45º). The image formation is represented by dots per inch. (low resolution dots per inch since it is less than news print). \nMy own interpretation of this image, I would explain that the Shroud is consistent with AM screening of LPI and DPI with varying frequencies. This image mechanism is why it produces such a good 3D rendition.

If the Shroud was made from a traditional 2-1 weave, apparent edge sharpness would be lost. Human observation may have played a roll in selecting a  3-1 weave pattern to create the image.\nSo many mysteries, and when all said and done, we may never know.\n\n","date":"November 10, 2014 at 9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/10/guest-posting-by-o-k-on-the-shroud-as-a-negative/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting by O.K. on the Shroud as a Negative"}]}
