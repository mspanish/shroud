She went home from the hosiptal where the doctors had given up on her, she lay down on her bed and tried to sleep, but couldn’t she felt a hugr hole in her heart. She then prayed to God to give her peace to be able to face the long day ahead. She saw a  silhouete of a person sitting on the edge of her bed. She knew it was the Holy ghost and felt safe and was able to sleep through the rest of the night. My mother also saw Jesus in a dream. After my sister died she had 2 miscarriages in the next to years, and longed to have  children. One night she had a dream, in the dream she saw Jesus, he was holding a baby in his arms. When He came closer she saw it was a girl with black hair and dark eyes.Jesus stretched out his arms to give her the baby. 1 month after she had the dream she found out she was pregnant again, and 9 months later she had a healthy baby girl with black hair and dark eyes. And that baby was me, I feel like gift from God. 1 year later my Mom was blessed with a baby boy.\n\n","date":"March 1, 2013 at 5:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"joselyn","post":"I plan to show this painting of Jesus to my mom to see if this is how He looked.
