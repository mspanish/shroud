My response is two pronged: 1 – The post was primarily made in jest. I am not literally embarrassed by owning a book such as this, or that I paid for it. I was a young Christian and it seemed interesting at the time, so I went for it. My post was a light hearted follow up to the previous meme about books we were embarrassed to own. 2 – I am neither a scientist nor an archaeologist, so my dismissal of the shroud is based primarily on the research and expertise of others, facts that I could not reproduce on the spot even with a gun held to my held. So my views of the shroud may indeed be based on very limited knowledge of the various issues surround it, but I have neither the desire nor the time to get into that whole issue. I have read/heard no compelling reason to think the shroud is genuine, so I’ll leave it at that. Sorry if you expected a rigorous attempt at refutation–it just doesn’t interest me much. Blessings!.","date":"2010-12-10","mins":"11:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/12/10/a-most-embarrassing-book-why-it-mentions-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"A Most Embarrassing Book.
