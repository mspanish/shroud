He got this dea from Dilazzaro articles. I know he is wrong and that the Turin Shroud is a scam. I shown him every aspect to prove him wrong but he sticks to the idea that the 300 nm thickness is the absolute proof that the Turin is not fake or special. Do you have anything I could throw him back so he would stop spreading stupidities.","date":"October 17, 2016 at 4:52 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"},{"author":"michael_ryuki","post":"Thank you very much. My contact is really psychorigid, I  think that even if he is wrong he will never admit it. I just sent him the answer you gave me, but I’m sure he is going to ask proofs like scientific papers, and even if I bring him those proofs he will still keep his position. This guy is a lost cause.Thanks anyway for the reply and for your great work.","date":"October 18, 2016 at 10:02 am","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/the-turin-shroud-surely-the-most-cunning-dastardly-con-trick-in-history-14th-century-france/","cat":"turin_shroud","title":"The Turin Shroud – surely the most cunning, dastardly con trick in history (14th century France)"}]}
