{"art":[{"author":"laurie","post":"My personal first reaction of Akiane’s painting “Prince of Peace” is that it does not resemble a man who is Jewish. It has more “European” features, probably picked up from the man that she used as a model for the painting. Perhaps she saw some similar features to what she thought she saw of Jesus “in her visit to her heaven”.  I am a graphic artist and have studied 3 years of art. When the image of the shroud is placed over the “Prince of Peace” painting, I can clearly see that the features and proportions do not match.\n\n","date":"August 25, 2014 at 1:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"}]}
