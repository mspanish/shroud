You can call yourself Winnie the Pooh (Winnie l’Ourson) for all I care but should not expect people to take you seriously. The title of teacher to which you cling so desperately was no longer applicable after 1978. As you say, at that time you had your whole life ahead of you. What happened? No publications, no qualifications you admit to, no Palmes Académiques after a successful career. Just a self taught archeocryptomedievalpsychphysiotherapist, with metal detector.

Mais ce n’est pas croyable. Et depuis qu’est ce qui s’est passé? Des diplômes, des thèses doctorales, des livres et des articles publiés, des universités qui se bousculent pour lui offrir des emplois comme cela se ferait s’il était vraiment un “professor”? Entre 1978 et 2005 il paraît qu’il y a ce que Goethe appelerait “die grosse Lücke” dans la carrière académique de Monsieur Hamon. Monsieur Hamon, tout le monde a le droit de se nommer comme il veut, mais personne n’a le droit de s’attendre à ce que les autres le croient, faute de preuves. “Mais puisque je le dis …”, cela ne marche pas..","date":"2013-06-24","mins":"5:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/20/colin-berry-a-hunch-just-that-that-rogers-may-have-been-used/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry:  a hunch – just that – that Rogers may have been used"}],"image":[{"id":"comment-210062","author":"sheona","post":"Good grief. What does one have to do to make some folk here see the difference between a contact imprint and a free hand painting? Making an imprint may take skill, but if taken from a real human being, as distinct from bronze bas relief etc, then it is NEVER a work of art. It is what the name implies – simply an imprint with the properties of an imprint (correctly spaced ventral v dorsal surfaces, negative character, 3 D properties etc). It’s the difference between a sand sculpture and a footprint in the sand… It is exceedingly tiresome to have Charles Freeman continuing to drone on about a “painting” when it’s so abundantly obvious – or should be – that the TS is an IMPRINT, and consequently NOT a work of art, at least where the body image is concerned. Blood additions are a different matter. They may well be considered “artistic”..","date":"2015-09-10","mins":"2:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/03/colin-berrys-latest-and-greatest-is-it-enough/","cat":"3d","title":"Colin Berry’s Latest and Greatest.
