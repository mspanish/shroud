{"researchers":[{"author":"christian_art_historian","post":"\n\nThe representation of Christ with wounds and heavily bleeding actually goes back to the fourteenth century. The book to look for is Caroline Walker Bynum's Wonderful Blood where she illustrates  the grotesque wounded pietas which first appear in the early fourteenth century. Note for instance the Fritzlar pieta, dated to pre 1350, where a bearded Christ is shown with a gaping wound in his side and many scourge marks. Rachel Fulton's From Judgement to Passion  deals with the earlier literary sources that dwell on the wounds of Christ which she dates to the eleventh century or earlier. So, for instance, the Old English poem Christ III ' And downcast in soul they shall also behold the ancient gashes and the gaping wounds in their God, even as his foes pierced his white hands and hallowed feet with nails, and likewise made blood run from his side, where blood and water issued forth together in the sight of all, flowing before the face of men, when he was on the cross'. (Fulton p. 57.)Neither of these books have anything to do with the Turin Shroud at all, they simply represent current scholarship on the suffering Christ with particular emphasis on his wounds.\n\n","date":"July 11, 2012 at 4:17 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/07/my-critique-of-charles-freemans-turin.html","title":"\nMy critique of Charles Freeman's \"The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey,\" part 1: \"Introduction\"\n"}]}
