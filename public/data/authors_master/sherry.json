{"misc":[{"author":"sherry","post":"This is to Brandon.\nChristians are not stupid, although some may not be as intelligent as others. We believe in Jesus Christ. NOTHING in the Holy Bible can be proven wrong. Yes, typically it is shown in paintings, on crosses that hang in churches, etc that the hands of Jesus are nailed. Don’t you think that when the people were actually crucifying other people they would notice that it would rip through the hands of those crucified! Duh!!! I mean it does not take a medical student to figure that out. Just look at the people that was doing the crucifying, they were idiots and they figured it out! They crucified OUR LORD and Savior. The Shroud of Turin is not fake, it is real. Is it so hard for you to read the Bible and open your heart and mind to accept Christ? One day you and all the other non-Christians will really regret not doing so. I’ll pray for you. GOD bless!!!\n\n","date":"February 2, 2011 at 6:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/11/23/late-breaking-website-news/","cat":"2010","title":"Late Breaking Website News!"},{"author":"sherry","post":"Do we not have enough to worry about here on our earth? I think if GOD wanted us to know if there were other planets that has life, HE would have told us so in the bible. I think too much money is being spent on unimportant things and we can’t even feed the poor. Come on now, do we really need to know about other planets? No. Do the hungry need to eat? Yes. So why don’t we stop looking for answers to questions that we are not suppose to know and get to feeding the hungry!\n\n","date":"February 2, 2011 at 6:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/31/more-earths-and-other-beings/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More Earths and Other Beings"}]}
