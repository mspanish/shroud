{"opinion":[{"author":"rosaliegiansante","post":"I’ve read so many accounts about the mysterious Shroud of Turin, and the last time fibers were taken and tested, showed the Shroud to have existed since the Middle Ages. Well, that was proven to be correct, however, the fibers were taken from a patch that the Poor Clares Nuns had put on the cloth after it was in a fire in France. If fibers were taken from other areas, I’m sure they would have shown the lined cloth dates back to the time of Jesus. The other question that arises, is “How do we know it belonged to Jesus and not to another person who was also executed by crucifixion. The only answer I have is that He was mocked as “King of the Jews” and was given a cap of thorns. This shows on the shroud as the bleeding in the head area. I doubt if others were also called “King of the Jews” and crowned with thorns. When you boil it down, it’s a matter of faith. Faith, being belief in something in spite of all the nay-sayers. Am I a believer? Absolutely, without doubt, I believe the Shroud of Turin to be the burial cloth of Jesus.\n\n","date":"October 9, 2015 at 3:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/09/no-closer-to-the-truth-because-of-simony/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"No Closer to the Truth Because of Simony"}]}
