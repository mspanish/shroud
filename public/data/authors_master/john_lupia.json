It was originally slated to be one of the formats for the book to be published this way but there are too many difficulties in PDF publishing that warranted this format to be rejected. The book was always intended to be a print publication and is now the only format Regina Caeli Press will publish it in. The first issue is in softcover or paperback. \nAs the blogger says by implication that there is not a single Shroud researcher aware of the first century tallit type and consequently they cannot think I am correct in my identification. But most researchers on the Shroud of Turin are not archaeologists and have never studied archaeological textiles. \nI appreciate Stephen’s comments very much. Especially the fact that if the Shroud of Turin can be shown to be an ancient Jewish tallit type before A.D. 66 then authentication becomes accomplished. It would be rather difficult for anyone to argue that it is a medieval forgery since the first century tallit type was not known during this time. It was not until the 17th century that anyone could even have connected the Shroud with the tallit.\nFirst century tallitot (plural) were not exclusively made of wool. The most ancient and popular fabric for them was linen. You cannot rely on Wikipedia or any other link on the internet to learn about the tallit because nearly all if not all describe the tallit as we know it today that has precedence beginning about 1000 A.D. This fact alone supports the view that a medieval forger would not have known about the ancient type.\nThe issue of the side strip is given careful attention throughout the book and plays an important role in helping us identify several important matters that help in identification of the Shroud as a tallit.\nTzitzyot (plural) were removed at burial. If the Shroud of Turin is an authentic tallit then we should not find them attached on the Shroud. But, this issue is a bit more complicated than this simplified explanation and is explained in the book.\nThe dimensions of the Shroud do not conform to 8 x 2 cubits of any sort. If you do the math you see for yourself. The correct dimensions are in my book.\nAs for the Gospel of Mark telling us about the role Joseph of Arimathea played with the Shroud it has been completely obscured by inept translations. The original Greek does not necessarily read as translations have it. But all of this is explained in the book.\nThe problem is not inherently impossible to resolve, Stephen, as there are many factors involved you can only learn by reading the book, which, by the way, also includes explanations about the C-14 dating done in 1988 based on physics.\nJohn\n\n","date":"March 3, 2010 at 1:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"john_lupia","post":"Stephen\nIn this world we can only express what we think. Every translation you have ever read in print expresses what the translator thinks the original message says.

I never said the tallit was that of Joseph of Arimathea which he bought back, obviating you never understood what I was saying since you wrote :\nEven if it be granted that “redeeming” was a usual term for buying used linen, which seems unlikely, as “redeem” has the meaning of buying back something that one formerly owned, i.e. “To recover ownership of by paying a specified sum” (The Free Dictionary). Which is especially unlikely in the case of the “rich man” Joseph of Arimathea (Mt 27:57) that he would have to buy back (e.g. from the 1st century equivalent of a pawnshop?) linen that he had previously owned!\nI hope it is a bit clearer now that Joseph bought back the tallit belonging to Jesus Christ to bury him with it.\nBest regards,\nJohn\n\n","date":"March 5, 2010 at 4:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"john_lupia","post":"Stephen\nIt is clear that discussing a book in a blog with someone who has not read the book can easily come to misunderstandings about what the book actually says. This is especially true when discussing the book with the author who is very reluctant to reveal the crux of the arguments, giving away the store, so to speak, but would rather have readers discuss the book who actually read it. So my recommendation to you and any other poster to this blog is to either buy the book or borrow a copy from a library, read it, and then discuss it here or anywhere else they wish to. \nRegarding the Pesach Eve, an ancient Jewish custom, you have asserted it is contemporary, not ancient. Yet, in your correct reading of the Gospel it clearly says Sabbath eve, meaning the approaching sundown for the Sabbath, when no work was allowed since the Sabbath began about 6 p.m. Friday evening. This is the eve of the Sabbath. Jews throughout history have left all work undone Friday afternoons usually around 2 p. m. to be home before sundown because there were restrictions on how far they could travel home and beyond that it was considered work and a Sabbath violation. Even when they got home they were limited to what they could do not to violate the Sabbath by working at home preparing for the Sabbath feast. So they left early (around 2 p.m.)  to get home and prepare for the Sabbath. This tradition is still true throughout the Middle East when Friday afternoon comes around all commerce ceases around 2 p.m. However, this was no ordinary Sabbath but one of the major Holy Day’s in the Jewish liturgical calendar, Passover (Pesach). This Pesach eve has always been part of the traditional Jewish celebration for Passover, nothing new, nothing modern, but rather, ancient. \nThe redemption or buying back of the tallit of Jesus by Joseph of Arimathea from the Roman soldier is more clearly explained in the book when you read in context.\nYes, himation was ONE of the Greek words used as a synonym for tallit. Other synonyms are given in the book. If it were that easy to find them all on your own then everyone would have easily known them all and the tallit theory would have been long discussed for years as a common piece of knowledge. That is why researchers do the research and publish. They have done the work and presented it on a silver platter so that readers can gain in moments what it took years for a researcher to learn and find through arduous investigations.\nI appreciate your enthusiasm doing biblical searches in Greek lexicons, etc. It shows you are very interested in Scripture and are serious about studying and learning as much as you can. I am sure you will enjoy reading my book whether you buy a copy or borrow one from a library because the study of Greek will be “right up your alley”, to use the American colloquialism. \nI have known about Donald Smith and his theorizing since that publication came out. I have been researching the Shroud of Turin since 1970. I had already developed the tallit theory about a year prior to Smith and was surprised at that time that anyone else considered it. It put me in a bit of a panic thinking it would catch on and that I needed to complete my work ASAP and publish it before anyone else did. But, nobody followed up on this and I breathed a sigh of relief knowing I had more time to research and investigate further since I was not content with the state of my research 1996-1997. As you can see I spent 14 years just studying the tallit specifically. \nI only ask that you be fair and kind and show charity and goodwill and mutual respect as a gentleman about a book he has never read and allow their neighbor (me) to have the book read by actual readers and listen and learn in order  to come to a fuller understanding of just what the book says. It is a bit awkward for me as an author to reveal too much. If you reveal too much too soon it does harm to the commercial value of the book. The book is my intellectual property and all I ask is that you respect that.  \nPerhaps in a month or so you will be reading reviews by readers of the book and you might find by that time it is available in your local library in Perth, Australia. So, be patient and keep all of these thoughts in the back of your mind until you read the book first hand.\nI am very glad to see that you have an enthusiastic interest in this subject since I am sure you will find something in the book worthwhile.\nIt would be not realistic for any author to expect nothing but rave reviews about their book. This is especially true about a book written about a subject that is controversial like the Shroud of Turin. Surprisingly, there are even advocates of the Shroud of Turin who for one reason or another will delight in giving this book scathing reviews, even though the book provides evidence to authenticate the Shroud. It seems that this group of critics fails to recall the words of our Lord in the Gospel of Mark 9:40 “for whoever is not against us is for us.” But age brings about wisdom, and as an older man I have come to realise one thing, that I can only control my behavior, not my neighbors. \nI began my journey in research on the Shroud of Turin as a dark haired young man. The book is now published when I am an older man with white hair. So please allow me, your neighbor, who is neither against you, nor against our Lord, nor against the Shroud, a chance to share his research with others who might be interested enough to buy the book. \nYou are free, of course, to continue to make judgments against me, my abilities, my theories, and my book. I only ask in Christian charity that you be fair and base your comments and criticisms on the merits or demerits of the book itself. For in the end any sensible author knows that all publicity, whether good or bad, stirs up interest in their book.\nBest regards,\nJohn\n\n","date":"March 6, 2010 at 11:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"john_lupia","post":"Theologian\nIt would seem a nutty notion that the Shroud of Turin is a tallit if you only understand the tallit form that has come down to us since 1000 A.D. The tallit is not a medieval invention but an ancient one at least 3,000 years before those that emerged in 1000 A.D. The book explains the ancient Jewish tallit form during the first century, a form very different to that used today, and were the dimensions of the Shroud of Turin.\nThe guy to whom you refer is Shimon Gibson who has made unwarranted comments for which he alone is responsible.  I am making mine in the book for which I alone am responsible. Just as you are responsible for the comments you have made here.\nAnyone can make any claim they wish, but they need supportable and verifiable data to back it up. I can only answer for myself. My book contains supportable and verifiable data to back my claim that the Shroud of Turin is an ancient Jewish tallit.\nThe question on translations I have explained in my second reply to Stephen. Inept here means not suitable to the time, place or event. There is great difficulty involved in determining the most suitable sense of the text, i. e., keeping the author’s intended sense. A typical example has already been given above when some translations of Mark 15:46 characterize the linen as unused. This, of course is inept, i.e., not suitable since the text does not say that. The key words are “agorasas sindona” and there is no sense in which it can convey an “unused linen” outside of interpretation. If the Greek phrase is interpreted to mean that Joseph of Arimathea went out to the market to buy a sindon then it would naturally seem logical that he bought a new one, i.e., one that was unused. But this is all part of the translator’s interpretation. But was that the author’s intended sense? Since these sorts of translations have been around so long there are generations of readers who have just such a picture painted in their mind of Joseph of Arimathea going out to the market to buy a sindon and cannot think outside of that image so deeply embedded in their minds. Yet it never occurs to many that this is not suitable for the time, place and event since it was a Jewish holy day and it is scarcely conceivable that shops selling linen or anything else were open. It should be pointed out that “agorasas” does not exclusively mean “to purchase, or to buy”, since it can also mean “redeem” or “to pay the tax”.  Moreover, the Greek sindon is left here to mean “linen”, a very broad term. But sindon more precisely means tallit. The sources for this are in the book. So if you translate this text where “agorasas” means “to redeem” and “sindona” to mean “tallit” there is an altogether different reading where Joseph of Arimathea went out to redeem the tallit. And from whom would he redeem it from? In the Gospels the tallit of Jesus was the booty in the Roman soldier’s hands who won it tossing dice. In this case Joseph of Arimathea went out to redeem the tallit from the Roman soldier.  I hope you see that there are various ways a text can be translated. Each one requires the translator to interpret the best they can rendering the text suitable according to that historical time, place and event. Moreover, there are various variants among texts going back to the early church papyri.

The book was forty years in the making and the last fourteen years were spent on the study of the tallit. The book is thoroughly and meticulously researched, and the manuscript was peer reviewed to assure that no blatant or any other form of errors were contained in it.

This fact alone overcomes your objection that Mt 27:59 does not mean washed since it certainly does. However, it requires someone who is familiar with the historical context and culture of that milieu to be able to comprehend that. When we translate or interpret scripture outside of the historical context in which it is written it is anachronistic and opens up Pandora’s box to every unwarranted thought and suggestion and either everything becomes possible or else a rigid narrow minded view is imposed where only one exclusive anachronistic meaning is possible. In this case you have clearly opted for the latter. \nYou wrote : “Not washed clean of bloodstains from being placed over a bleeding living body that had been scourged and crowned with thorns!”\nThis is a fragment sentence and does not make sense grammatically. \nYour next sentence seems to imply that what you are saying is that if Jesus’ tallit was bloodstained it was ceremonially unclean.  I think you finally see my point.\nAccording to Mark 15:25 Jesus was crucified at the third hour, which requires us to calculate the time from the Roman hours of the day telling us it was at 9 a.m. If he was being buried between 5 and 6 p.m. that gave the Apostles and Joseph of Nicodemus 8 or 9 hours to have the tallit washed and dried. The actually number of hours to do this in Jerusalem during springtime is certainly less than half that time. Having lived in the Middle East and laundered clothes drying them outside I can tell you from experience it would not take more than a few hours. So judging from my own experience I can assert that it would have only taken about a quarter or less of the allotted time in the timeline. Yet you claim : “There is also the impossibility of cleaning a 4.5 square metres, absorbent linen sheet of all traces of blood, in the limited time available.”\nYou continually make wrong conclusions and vigorously assert them very dogmatically as if they are facts. \nAs for your following comments I will preface them by what I have said previously :\nI can see you are only continually looking for loopholes to prove my thesis has no valid basis in scripture and is easily refutable. That is pretty discourteous to the author since it suggests that something so self-evident eluded him and that insufficient study and research has led him down the wrong path.  \nIf you are a Jew then you do not work on a Holy day. If you are a Roman fullo you can work since they were Gentiles and not bound by Mosaic law. Judea was ruled by a Roman Procurator and many Gentile Romans lived in Jerusalem at the time of the crucifixion. Once again your object is easily overcome by anyone familiar with the historical context and culture of that milieu and obviates the fact that you have not done your homework.\nAs for Jesus’ burial shroud being his own personal tallit all the original sources are cited in my book. \nYour continued demonstration of convoluted logic, ignorance of biblical Greek, philology, historical context and culture of that milieu, is doing you more harm as an author to your prospective readers than you are attempting to foist on me. The objections you propose are those of a layman and I am glad you have voiced them allowing me to air them out here in the event anyone else comes to these same considerations. Here they will find a wealth of information to help them see there are explanations that easily overcome them. So, for this opportunity I thank you very much allowing my prospective readers to plainly see that my thesis is not self-contradictory as you dogmatically and continuously assert though you never read my book. This also makes readers of this blog wonder what your real motive might be since I have already politely asked you that if you do think you see problems or objections to my thesis to kindly ask me for an explanation which I would most generously provide as I already have. Yet you continually take a confrontational and adversarial approach that winds up backfiring on you making your readership wonder about the validity and quality of research of your own books.\nThanks again for helping to publicize my book.

The fact that I have already checked the sources you cite for many years should tell you I already know what they say. What you do not know are the sources I cite that verify what I say is valid since I did not cite them in this blog  but in my book.\nAll who do read this blog will know that I have checked the sources I cited in this blog, just as you have, but they will also know that I have other sources cited in my book not revealed in this blog that support and defend what I am saying. \nIt is not that these lexicons I referred you to in this blog are wrong, but incomplete. It is true that himation means tallit, but it is false to say it is the exclusive word that means tallit. It is true to say that sindon means linen, but it is false to say it only means linen to the exclusion of tallit. It is true to say that sindon is the preferred word for tallit and false to say that it is not. Consequently, anyone or any lexicon that says sindon cannot mean tallit is incorrect. The word sindon has been known since the 17th century to mean tallit. This truth has been confirmed by the most prominent Jewish scholar accepted as the authority in biblical studies. I have not cited the 17th century sources not the Jewish scholar just mentioned. \nAs already mentioned earlier in this blog I pointed out that researchers spend years to discover things and publish them so that readers can learn in a few moments what it took the researcher years to learn.\nAs for your attempt at refuting my translation I gave to Luke 23:53 the commentary I posted is not mine but a New Testament Greek scholar cited in my book. When I made this discovery that Luke 23:53 could be translated this way I wrote to this Greek New Testament scholar to ask his opinion and he confirmed it and what you have read is what he wrote.\nAs already mentioned by me here in this blog I have always consulted the best authorities directly. I could see and understand your point in your constant effort to debunk me if I worked in complete isolation and everything I claim in the book is something never before consulted, but the book has been peer reviewed. No intelligent author publishes new discoveries they have made, especially discoveries that authenticate a controversial subject like the Shroud of Turin, without expert consultation. Can’t you be so kind as to accept this? And have an open mind that others may have something new to offer that without reading their book you can never understand.\n\n","date":"March 10, 2010 at 12:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"john_lupia","post":"Stephen\nRegarding the translations of Mark 15:46 take a look at your reply to me. You wrote , ” This agrees with my Interlinear Greek translation: “And having bought a piece of unused linen …” This is a good example of what I am referring to since this is not what the Greek reads. The translators, as all translators must do, interpreted the meaning to read according to their translation criteria. The phrase “unused linen” is an interpretation of “sindona” which is a critically important word for understanding what the Shroud of Turin really is. My guess is whoever rendered this translation conflated the meaning with Matthew 27:59 who uses the phrase: sindoni kathara. Again, this phrase too has been subjected to interpretation to read “a clean linen”. It is outside the scope of writing in a blog to explain the intricacies  of New Testament Greek translations. The key idea you must keep in mind is that when translations are made the translators interpret. Interpretations are based upon their assumptions or model or view of what is going on in the text and what each word refers to according to the author’s intention. This is not an easy task. These texts are clearly explained in the book.\nBest regards,\nJohn\n\n","date":"March 4, 2010 at 12:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"john_lupia","post":"Stephen\nThe theory presented by Dr. Mechthild Flury-Lemberg is her theory, not a fact. She presented her theory in order to explain the Shroud of Turin as we see it today with the side strip as original at the time of manufacture as her best explanation. I discussed this with her for about two months and she did seem to agree that another explanation as I have given is possible. \nThe Greek lexicons you have do not put sindon = tallit for some reason. However, the Greek word sindon has been known to mean precisely “tallit” since it was discovered in the 17th century in Hebrew and Greek texts by John Lightfoot in 1653. This is an interesting fact in itself that precludes any medieval forgery. Also, very interesting is the fact that his work is never cited by Greek lexicons. Also interesting is the fact that Marcus Jastraw the highly respected source of multiple volume lexicons that provide Hebrew and Greek translations of ancient original texts where he too cites sindon as tallit is also not cited in the Greek lexicons that you consult. It is not that they are wrong but incomplete. Since they do not contain complete citations does not falsify the meaning of sindon = tallit. That would be an illogical conclusion for anyone to assert since the evidence refutes it.\nThe remainder of your so-called Poperian falsification is circular argumentation since you cannot ascertain that sindon means tallit. You can, of course, comprehend this if you do the research as I have done and read Lightfoot and Jastraw. Until you do you are doing nothing more than repeating ad nauseum the same claim which my book clearly shows is dead wrong. The fact that you continue to pursue the same arguments over and over again without checking sources that were cited in the review already shows your lack of objectivity and dedication to research in the matter. Can you please explain why you never checked Lightfoot and Jastraw which the review cited? Until you do you are only doomed to circular argumentation. You have never proven that sindon does not mean tallit. All you have done is shown that certain Greek lexicons do not have it, which is no proof at all.\nYou claim the tzitzyot were removed from the four corners in a manner not proposed in my book. I also find it risible that you refer NOW to the dimensions of the Shroud from the Restoration in 2002 something you NEVER knew until I pointed it out to you. The same is true about the theory proposed by Dr. Flury-Lemberg, which you NEVER knew until I pointed it out to you. These two facts are clear in the blog here  and in the associated blog on this site under Shimon Gibson saying nothing about the Shroud. Yet you purport to be an expert on the Shroud and never knew these two very basic facts published widely these past eight years. I have known these facts along these years and analyzed them in the book. Without reading my book you will never learn about their analysis unless a blogger or some other website cites them. \nAs for Gilbert Raes you have made an enormous blunder. You apparently know nothing about his writings. Raes reports are completely contrary to what you are purporting he said. He is the expert who did find cotton inside the threads at the time of spinning NOT weaving. \nAll biblical evidence supports my thesis since my thesis is based primarily on the biblical evidence. But you would need to read my book to find that out.\nIt is rather curious that a so-called proponent of authentication of the Shroud of Turin is so driven to disprove a viable thesis that proves the Shroud is authentic. It is like the football player who catches the ball and runs the wrong way making a touchdown on the opponents goal line. One is wondering whose side you are really on. Your own words seem to suggest which. Matthew 7:16 By their fruit you will recognize them. Luke 6:44 Each tree is recognized by its own fruit.\n\n","date":"March 21, 2010 at 10:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"john_lupia","post":"Stephen\nYou wrote 1) the Shroud linen (if it is authentic) “is after all, a cloth measured in a pre-industrial society,” with the clear implication that it is unreasonable to expect it to conform to modern standards of exact measurement; \nFirst, I make no claim that the Shroud conforms to modern standards of exact measurement, but ancient standards of exact measurement.\nSecond, you claim 1) the Shroud linen (if it is authentic) “is after all, a cloth measured in a pre-industrial society,” \nThis is anachronistic. There was industrial society using very strict standards and units of measurement in the first century; or else your own argument falls apart claiming the the various cubits were applicable. \nI agree with your number 2 but in Shroud literature there is little or no evidence to show the length has been shortened. In my book I do show the length has been shortened and I speculate using the standard unit of measurement at the time how much is missing.\nYour number 3 is off the mark. Since 2002 the Shroud width does not measure 111 cm, but 113 to 113.7. This does not equal 110 cm. The unit of measurement you are applying is the wrong one. The correct one is published in my book.\nYour number 4 also like 3 above applies to the pre-2002 conservation. The shrinkage and expansion of the Shroud was due to it being sewn onto the Holland cloth, now removed. It has been carefully stretched out now and sandwiched between glass panels to keep it stretched out. The new reading of the measurements should be true or the same throughout time.\nI think we actually might be saying the same thing, in a sense, since you are assertive that the Shroud can be shown to conform to an ancient unit of measurement, just as I do. So, I agree. The only difference is I found another ancient unit that works much better. I think you will be very pleased when you read about it.\nCordially,\nJohn\n\n","date":"March 4, 2010 at 10:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"},{"author":"john_lupia","post":"Hi Stephen\nIf you read my comment to Theologian below you will understand my initial point more clearly.

The objections you propose are those of a layman, amateur and hobbyist since you cite authors whom you think are authorities that no biblical scholar would cite as an authoritative source or reference, like Vine. In biblical Greek scholarship the two standard references are to Kittel and BGD. \nNow you are imputing violation of the Sabbath law not to work to a Jew who hires Gentiles to do the work for them. This is very convoluted logic. If you choose to characterize this as Joseph of Arimathea as well as all Jews who did this as a practice as having “circumvented the Mosaic Law” or “dishonesty in the things of God” you are only showing that you do not understand the culture and are viewing this anachronistically, since by doing so any Jew that did this acted within the law and was not circumventing or being dishonest with God, but rather, did what was permissible, i.e., what God allowed.\nYou wrote :\n“But apart from the dishonesty in the things of God you would then be attributing to Joseph, a devout Jew (“a disciple of Jesus” – Mt 27:57; Jn 19:38; who was “waiting for the kingdom of God” – Mk 15:43; Lk 23:51), that would still be work in that it would be a Jew buying services off a Gentile on a holy day (according to you).”\nNow you are saying that buying services is work in violating the Sabbath prohibition, but fail to consider by your own logic that buying linen would too be the same violation. Once again, this is very convoluted logic.\nYou wrote :\n“And if only Gentiles could then work on Passover Eve (according to you) then why could not Joseph have “bought some linen cloth” (Mk 15:46) from a Gentile market stall? Since Syria was then the major linen production centre in the Middle East, it is highly likely that there would have been Syrian markets selling linen open on Passover Eve, if not in Jerusalem itself, then outside the then city’s walls.”\nFirst, your conditional phrase ““And if only Gentiles could then work on Passover Eve” is incorrect since it is a fact. Only Gentiles could work when Jews were prohibited by law.\nSecond, your suggestion that a Jew buy linen or a tallit from a Gentile once again shows your ignorance of the historical context and culture of that milieu of Judea in the first century or any other time for that matter. No Jew would buy anything to wear or touch that has been touch by Gentiles (goyim), which makes the object unclean. Jewish merchants sold tallitot, not Gentiles.\nThird, you are asserting based on very limiting reading that “Since Syria was then the major linen production centre in the Middle East” something that is not quite true. The Roman Province of Syria was only one of the important linen production centers. Palestine was also a major linen center. So was Egypt. Perhaps you never heard of Egyptian linen before.\nFourth, you wrote :\n“it is highly likely that there would have been Syrian markets selling linen open on Passover Eve, if not in Jerusalem itself, then outside the then city’s walls.”\nMaybe they have Syrian markets in Perth, Australia! There was no such thing known in first century Judea. Syrian merchants together with all the other merchants may have had a place in the agora to sell wares but there were not any Syrian markets set up in Judea.\nThe rest of your post only shows your lack of knowledge of New Testament Greek and the accepted scholarly sources. For your own edification buy a copy off Kittel and BGD. Also very excellent sources on NT Greek are Abel, Balz, Chantraine, Funk, Lampe, LSJ, Louw, Spiq, Strong, Swetnam, and  Zerwick.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2010 at 10:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"}]}
