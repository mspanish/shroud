{"history":[{"author":"chris_drake","post":"I first learned of the shroud when I was little (watching a TV show aired in Greater Boston in black and white) and even back then was moved by the sweet face and intense suffering so visible to all. I was most impressed that the man’s face held no anger, no fury against anyone or anything despite all the brutality he had so obviously endured. The recent History Channel documentary, The Real Face of Jesus From the Shroud of Turin, also moved me but in different ways: for one, I was struck by the impact the shroud has had on scientists, especially Ray Downing who developed the full-color image for us with modern equipment. Injuries to the the body were as extensive as those suffered by people who die in car wrecks: “He was murdered many times over.” ~ Earlier photographs of the face in the shroud always gave me the impression of an older man with a gray beard, an infinitely kind and caring grandfather, perhaps, not the young vibrant man with the handsome face we now see thanks to modern technology. After giving the History Channel face further thought, and being Roman Catholic, I cried to think, Dear Jesus, What have I done? What have I failed to do? For me the Shroud is unique evidence of man’s inhumanity to man, man’s inhumanity to God – but God raised Him from the dead.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2011 at 9:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/30/abc-good-morning-america-on-tonights-history-channel-shroud-of-turin-special-2/","cat":"history","title":"First Reaction: History Channel’s Shroud of Turin: The Real Face of Jesus"}]}
