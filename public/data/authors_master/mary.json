I always knew that Jesus hair is not long as in the pictures, but short like the painting.  When I saw the little girls’ picture a while back on her website, I said the same thing.  We have seen God’s Glory Jesus Christ.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2011 at 1:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"mary","post":"James, invite Jesus into your heart.  Ask Him to help you understand, but on His terms, not your own.  God and everything He is, is a mystery, one we may never come to understand.  Ask Him to give you a heart of love and forgiveness for what your parents did to you, physically and emotionally. Pray for this every day, and be patient. God will answer you on His terms, not yours.  This is OK, there is a time for everything, and God is in control of everything.\nI will pray for you James.\nGod Bless,\nMary\n\n","date":"April 8, 2012 at 6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"mary","post":"It’s Easter Eve and I’m reading everyone entries, and crying … crying not sad tears, but happy tears — tears for Christ.  And my old standby comes to my mind … there is not ONE thing I can do to make Him love me more, there is not ONE thing I can do to make Him love me less.  What a Savior we have in Christ!  Thank God Almighty for Easter, thank God Almighty for our Risen Christ!\nFor those of you who God revealed Himself to in a “physical” way, what a beautful blessing.  I can only imagine what a treasure that is for you.  Don’t ever let it fade, hold fast to it until you meet Him in Heaven.\nWarmly,\nMary\n\n","date":"April 7, 2012 at 10:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"mary","post":"The man i saw that came to me when i was sick was the face of Akiane Jesus ,when i turned it on to watch katie c show i started to cry i dont know why but that is the face i saw in my room!\n\n","date":"October 10, 2012 at 3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"mary","post":"I believe the same ,we are His hands ,without us  He can’t  reach people and help them .I myself have seen Jesus three times.

His unwavering commitment to the authenticity of the Shroud, and the research that has been done thus far will continue to have a far reaching impact on the scientific as well as the religious world. The integrity he puts forth in the work is evident when you speak with him. Simply put, he has given his life- his career to the Shroud of Turin. In the end, he and all of us must anwser to our God, and having said that, it seems to me his obligation to the sacred preservation of it (in all its forms) is not taken lightly.
