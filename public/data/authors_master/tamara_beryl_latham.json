Seek and ye shall find!\nOne doesn’t have to be a rocket scientist; one just has to have a pair of good eyes.\nFact:  Pia Secondo took a photo of the face on the Shroud and then he developed the photo.  The image on his negative is the face we see of Jesus today (Shroud image). \nI duplicated this process with the Sudarium of Oviedo (the head napkin that covered the head of Jesus in the tomb).  I downloaded the Sudarium photo and then printed it out.\nI then took a photo with my digital camera and printed out that image.\nAnd unbelievably, there it was.  The Oviedo cloth contained the same face as that on the Shroud of Turin. \nThe Shroud scientists have also confirmed the blood spots on both the Shroud and the Sudarium line up exactly, and both have AB blood type.  These scientists concluded both head napkin and shroud covered the same man.\nI then downloaded the “Hand of God” image taken by the NASA Chandra telescope.  This pulsar is 17,000 light years away (equivalent to 1700 years ago).\nAfter downloading the Chandra image, I placed all three side by side.  Amazingly all three photos are of the same man.  No doubt about it!\nWith that in mind, the image of Jesus has appeared on two different cloths and once in the stars.  The Chandra image even contains a crown of red stars.  Check it out on Google images (Hand of God, Chandra telescope).\nGod has shown you His image and His wounds on both the Sudarium and the Shroud and He has shown you His exact image in the stars (1700 years ago)\nHow much more proof does one need?  \nAnd how does Dawkins explain the DNA double-helix and all the genetic coding of humans, plants and animals?  Only God could accomplish such engineering.\nDoes Dawkins believe the entire DNA chain just materialized in some primordial soup?  Amino acids maybe, but not DNA.  The probability of that happening is trillions to one.  \nThere are many who align themselves with Dawkins’ views, but I am of the opinion, like the old cliche,  “A one-eyed man is King in the land of the blind”\nBest,\nTamara Beryl Latham\n\n","date":"April 1, 2012 at 12:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/30/a-20000-shroud-of-turin-challenge-to-richard-dawkins/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A £20,000 Shroud of Turin Challenge to Richard Dawkins"}],"researchers":[{"author":"tamara_beryl_latham","post":"The oldest physical description of Jesus by Pilate and various others, who lived at the time of Jesus, confirm the image detailed on the Shroud of Turin.  \nSee the link.\nPhysical Description of Jesus\nPhysical Descriptions of Jesus The Oldest Views and Literary Data on the External … Pilate to Tiberius Caesar describing the physical appearance of Jesus. …\nhttp://www.thenazareneway.com/likeness_of_our_saviour.htm – Cached – Similar\nFurther, the image taken by the Chandra Telescope from 1700 years ago, titled “Hand of God” is also very similar to the Shroud image of Jesus.

The Sudarium and the Shroud of Turin both have the rare blood type AB.This alone should be cause for alarm, with respect to the C14 dating of the shroud.

Then, download the picture of the head napkin of Christ that has been in Oviedo, Spain since the 700s.  Once you download this picture, take a picture of the downloaded picture with your camera.  The same image as that of the Shroud of Turin appears.  Both the Shroud image, the Chandra image and the Oviedo image are the same face.  This IS the face of Jesus.

And this is the face we see today with the photo image taken by Barrie Schwortz.\nI did the same experiment. \nDownload an image of the Sudarium of Oviedo and print it out, and then take a picture of the printed image with your camera. The face that appears is the exact image as that facial image on the Shroud.  And I mean exact, with the long nose, small lips, eyes, beard, etc.   \nSo, in conclusion the face appears on the Oviedo cloth, dated 700s.  The same face appears on the Sudarium (Carbon dating was off) and the same face appears in the sky somewhere around 300 AD (CE).  \nWhat one should wonder is what happened around 300 AD that Jesus found it so necessary to appear in the sky? \nI haven’t researched this extensively, but I did find in 303 AD, according to Michael Baigent in “The Jesus Papers,” that it was the beginning of the Christians being persecuted by Diocletian, Emperor of Rome, and there was massive destruction and deaths.\nWith that in mind, I wondered if the Chandra image could be dated to 303 AD?  I suppose NASA could do the calculations.\nWhat needs to be shown is all three images side by side.  There is no doubt all three are of the same man.\nBest,\nTamara Beryl Latham\n\n","date":"March 31, 2012 at 11:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/27/sky-news-interview-with-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","title":"Sky News Interview with Thomas De Wesselow"}]}
