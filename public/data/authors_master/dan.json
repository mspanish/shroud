Then there is this nice but far too short biography from the Miner Messenger, a publication of the alumni, friends, and parents of Bishop Manogue Catholic High School in Reno, Nevada. I wish I knew more. Chapel Stained Glass Artists Have International Reputation Bishop Manogue has been graced with the works of remarkable and internationally famous artists, the sisters Isabel and Edith Piczek. Both sisters were born in Hungary. They were friends of Sister Ida, Foundress of the Sacred Heart Sisters who provided years of ministry in the Diocese of Reno. Isabel, our principal contact, won a national competition for painting at a very early age, and at thirteen she decorated her first church with stained glass. Young Isabel, a Catholic, got herself into religious conflict with the communist government of Hungary and had to flee her country, accompanied by Edith, her sister and colleague. Almost immediately after her arrival in Rome, she won the International Grand Award for Painting and another competition to paint a 400 square foot fresco mural at the Vatican’s famous Pontifical Biblical Institute. She spent three years in Rome. During this time she completed another 42 murals at the Precious Blood Monastery of Rome and elsewhere. She also pursued her other interest, particle physics. Leaving Rome, Isabel came with her sister to the United Stated and with her she established her art studio, the Construction Art Center in Los Angeles. To date she has completed huge murals, mosaics, ceramic tile murals and stained glass windows for 493 churches and public buildings in seven countries on three continents. In addition to her outstanding work in the Bishop Manogue chapel, some of Isabel’s major works can be found at the St. Thomas Aquinas Cathedral and Our Lady of Snows parishes in Reno; the Guardian Angel Cathedral in Las Vegas; the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.; Holy Cross Mausoleum in Culver City, California; Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, California; and numerous other buildings in California, Rome, Canada, Illinois, New Mexico and elsewhere.

I offered to read a paper if you would write one. A reader if this blog was not so gentle. But if you are going to put up a You Tube video and make bold claims, like you do, you must expect criticism. You say,”If I can gain some trust and respect I will tell you all exactly how to do it.” Vinny, it doesn’t work that way. If you want trust and respect you will have to earn it. If you want to earn it, tell us exactly how you do it. I’ve looked at your shaky videos I don’t see stones over the eyes. I don’t see severed toes. You say, “I have explained on the clip which is now spreading around the net like a virus about the ripped toes how I develope the images.” No you have not explained anything with any satisfactory amount of detail. And your video is not going around like a virus. As of 12:15 GMT, your video has been viewed 40 times on You Tube. People aren’t even linking much from here. Here is what you wrote: “I take a close up of the Shroud image I am working on. I alter the frequency of the light angles and refilm. I repeat this process 2 or 3 times depending on how much clarity is required. On overlapping the new images which have had the light frequency altered the incredible and life like images are revealed. This is only made possible because the Shroud is a true photographic negative. To all Shroud scientists if you need more evidence arrange a place and time and you will then see exactly how I alter the light frequencies and over lay the images.” Film or digital? Which image of the Shroud? What magnification? What focal length, aperture, exposure? What different light frequencies? Overlapping using what algorithmic method? How do you know that the image is a true photographic negative? Time and place?

Ernst Kitzinger, Jewish German born in Munich in 1912, one of the great art historian specializing in ancient art, medieval and Byzantine small group belonged to the prodigiously gifted German Art Historians, which included Richard Krautheimer, Erwin Panofsky and Kurt Witzmann, and developed most of its activity in the United States.

The interested reader can find the citation for his important work and his biography on the “Dictionary of Art Historians,” Dictionary of Art Historians associated with Duke University http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/kitzingere.htm Lavoie was lucky Kitzinger could meet just before he left for England, where he planned to live out their retirement. The consultation Lavoie, who was working on the marks of blood, was: – Can you show work by artists who have painted as blood marks you see on the Shroud of Turin?. And this was the answer to Ernst Kitzinger: “The Shroud of Turin is unique in the art. Do not fall into any category of art. For us, a very small group of experts around the world, we believe that the Shroud of Turin is actually the Shroud of Constantinople. You know that the Crusaders took many treasures back to Europe in the thirteenth century and believe that the Shroud is one of them. As for the blood marks made by the artists, there are no pictures with marks of blood such as the Shroud. You are free to find …..

Instead you eventually wrote,”How can I now take you seriously when you see nothing at all its a total waste of time then, you see nothing so why tell you anything maybe we both need glasses.” (sic) What I said is I don’t see what you claim to see. I asked others to look and they don’t see stones over the eyes or severed toes.

I will not erase existing comments you have made. It is poor netiquette to do so. Okay, let’s not waste any more time, Vinny.

I believe that Sue Benford and Joe Marino started out with the close up photos. That was pretty much all that was being used as evidence when Ray Rogers was involved. I don’t think Sue and Joe paid any attention to the quad mosaics, at least in writing or in presentations, before their article in Chemistry Today in 2008. Maybe Joe can confirm this. Am I right? I think you have it wrong, Hugh. I’m a bit troubled when Hugh writes of the close up photos, “These were of rather poor quality at the time, but nevertheless evinced remarkably conﬁdent conﬁrmations of its presence from several expert tailors.” Tailors? Textile experts? Is Hugh looking at the same pixel density photos that Sue and Joe were using? Or was he looking or at web based quality image files (72dpi)? How does he know that these are remarkably confident confirmations? Did he consult textile experts? Is this personal judgment? I’d like to know a little bit more in this area. On occasion, Hugh has made it clear that he sits on a fence when it comes to authenticity. It’s a percentage thing, this way or that way. I’m sympathetic to this. I get it. But then I read this article in BSTS and I think that but for an adjective here and another one there — or by the turn of a phrase like remarkably confident — and this article, itself, sits on the fence. I could pencil it up and pretty much say how confident I am in Sue and Joe’s work. I was. I remain so. Iconoclastic? Maybe. I’ve been there. I’m there now and then. Some backwards history?

Neutron radiation not only creates new C 14 atoms, but also creates Cl 36 and Ca 41 atoms which virtually do not exist in nature. If such an event occurred, these rarest of atoms would still be present within the molecular structures of the linen, blood, or other irradiated material. The presence of these atoms, well above their infinitesimal natural levels, could only result from neutron radiation, which could not be generated by humans until the 20th century. “Interestingly, all three atoms (C 14, Cl 36 and Ca 41) are created by neutron radiation at rates that are known to scientists. Thus the amount of neutron radiation received by the Shroud, and the date this miraculous event occurred, can be calculated by scientists with the same accuracy as C 14 or radiocarbon dating.

But the cheap shot wasn’t directed at Catholics. It was, in this case, because a Roman Catholic priest (formerly Episcopalian) was begging for money online, having difficulty supporting his family. It was a Catholic archbishop who was living in a lavish house. It happens in every tradition. The rector of Trinity Wall Street Episcopal Church lives in an in town Manhattan mansion that is even bigger and more expensive. The church paid for it. It was Catholics who finally shamed the archbishop into selling his Atlanta home. Good for them. Pope Francis has set the tone and that is why not only Catholics love him but so does everyone. Here is an RNS story as it appeared in the Washington Post: VATICAN CITY — Days after Pope Francis summoned a controversial German bishop for talks on his luxurious lifestyle, the Vatican is facing an embarrassing new scandal about the lavish spending of Atlanta Archbishop Wilton Gregory. Gregory on Monday (March 31) apologized for a lapse in judgment after he built a plush $2.2 million mansion for himself in the heart of Atlanta’s upscale Buckhead district. His extravagant investment has provoked an outcry from some local Catholics, forcing the 66 year old archbishop to “apologize sincerely and from my heart” in a statement published in The Georgia Bulletin, a Catholic newspaper. “I personally failed to project the cost in terms of my own integrity and pastoral credibility with the people of God of north and central Georgia,” the archbishop said. “I failed to consider the impact on the families throughout the archdiocese who, though struggling to pay their mortgages, utilities, tuition and other bills, faithfully respond year after year to my pleas to assist with funding our ministries and services.” The pope himself rejected the Vatican’s ornate papal apartments for more simple lodging in the Santa Marta residence behind St. Peter’s Basilica and chose a humble Ford Focus for his official vehicle. Construction of Gregory’s new 6,000 square foot home was funded by money left by parishioner Joseph Mitchell, nephew of “Gone With the Wind” author Margaret Mitchell, when he died in 2011. Mitchell left $15 million and his home to his local parish and the archdiocese and asked that his endowment be used for charity. Gregory said he had received many “heartfelt, genuine and candidly rebuking” telephone calls, letters and emails for what he had done and published one atop his apology: “We are disturbed and disappointed to see our church leaders not setting the example of a simple life as Pope Francis calls for,” read the anonymous complaint. The archbishop’s personal apology came as he appeals on his own archdiocese website for donations to the church’s 2014 annual appeal beneath the headline, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”.","date":"2014-04-15","mins":"3:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/11/funny-that-when-it-comes-to-the-shroud-of-turin-the-carbon-testing-must-be-considered-watertight-scientific-proof/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Funny that when it comes to the Shroud of Turin the carbon testing must be considered watertight scientific proof."},{"id":"comment-95636","author":"dan","post":"I’m sorry, Stephen, but some time ago I explained some ground rules about questioning someone’s intellectual honesty in this blog without solid evidence.

You go about acting like a polymath: an expert on ancient medals, Templar history and all manner of things and people while criticizing Flury Lemberg for stepping out of what you have defined as her boundaries when it comes to expertise. It is getting old, this act of yours of being the junkyard dog of shroud research. It is tiresome. Two years ago you arrived on the scene and with no foundation in shroud science you started criticizing the work of fellow scientists like Al Adler, and Paolo Di Lazzaro by calling their work “Mickey Mouse science.” You called the folks at ENEA “idiots” and a “bunch of jokers.” Lately you have been telling us all about Rogers. Those who knew him know that you have no idea what you are talking about. Kim Johnson of the New Mexicans for Science and Reason wrote the following as part of an obituary for Rogers who was also a member of this skeptical society. “He was a Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and tried to be an excellent, open minded scientist in all things. In particular, he had no pony in the ‘Shroud of Turin’ horserace, but was terribly interested in making sure that neither proponents nor skeptics let their scientific judgment be clouded by their preconceptions. He just wanted to date and analyze the thing. He died on March 8th from cancer. He was a good man, and tried his best to do honest science.” I read hundreds of emails by Rogers. I read his papers. He didn’t go about blasting other people. He didn’t need to. Methinks Colin, the “sciencebod” as he calls himself, should stick to his field of chemistry, and leave the interpretation of ancient history (medals and the Hungarian Pray Codex) and the evaluation of other people’s performance and expertize to those who know what they are talking about. Two years ago, when you started commenting in this blog, I had hoped for a helpful skeptic who was a good chemist. You have been that and you have made a valuable contribution.

I know Joe Nickell, an American, spent some time attempting to duplicate the 3 D effect. He didn’t do a totally bad job. But he copied from the shroud and did not start with real body or even a statue, which isn’t all that difficult. What he was not able to do was reproduce the detail or get the saturation details correct. Was Jesus washed. Keep in mind, if you are going to rely on custom, that the burial may not have been complete if indeed Passover was about to begin. And by the way, there are forensic experts such as Fred Zugibe, the head of forensics for Rockland County, NY, who argue that the body indeed might have been washed. Dead bodies, undisturbed, normally don’t bleed. But slight movement can cause blood to flow out of a body. It isn’t cut and dry. Would they have left the thorn crown in there. Most shroud researchers see no evidence of this. This hypothesis comes mainly from Alan Whanger. But, yes, they might have left it in there, probably would have. Blood shed in death was considered near sacred and items of clothing and anything else with the blood on it would probably have been buried. Your theories about the Gospels have merit and are recognizedd by many scholars. I tend to agree with much of what you say. I don’t think however that John was copied from Mark. Matthew probaby was derived in large measure from Mark or possibly Q, a hypothetical earlier lost source. Luke was also probably sourced from Mark or even Matthew. I agree that we cannot confirm the authors. Luke seems to be the real Mc Coy and Matthew and Mark may be attributions to oral traditions ascribed to them. John may have been John of Patmos or the “beloved disciple” who may or may not have been John. As for one or more of the authors trying to explain the destruction of the Temple, I think the idea has merit. But I think it is a matter of degree and tone and not an attempt at pure allegory or metaphor. Actually, the fact you mention about lime pits is partly correct. There is no evidence of burning but, yes, crucifixion victims were thrown into shallow pit grave and lime was used to prevent disease. Many of the victims were left on their crosses (and poles in some cases) as carrion for birds and wild dogs. John Dominic Crossan, who until his retirement taught at St Paul University (Catholic) has made a great deal about this and suggested that Jesus may not have been buried. But the Gospels don’t speak about normal circumstances but a premitted exception. Archeological evidence has proven that at least one other individual (known not to be Jesus) was crucified and buried in a tomb with the spike still through his foot. You refer to the coincidental references to the Torah Scriptures (actually the references apply more broadly to Old Testament literature). Many scholars think that indeed those references were not merely coincidental but a literary device known as historizing prophesy. That is quite possible. It does not diminish their significance, in my opinion.

The point is missed: the anomolies in the region of the C14 sample are sufficient to impute reasonable doubt to the 1988 testing. They cannot any longer be called definative by any stretch of the imagination. They draw attention to many red flags that were simply ignored in 1988 and when the paper was written in 1989. I quoted Brown correctly. One does not judge Villarreal by the audience. How ad hominem is that? (Not that everyone at the conference sided with Rogers, which you presume. There were those who still hope that John Jackson is correct). Ramsey’s point is that more studies are need. Indeed they are. Given the blue mosaic photographs that showed some evidence of chemical anomolies. Given that Giovanni Riggi, the person who actually cut the carbon 14 sample from the Shroud stated, “I was authorized to cut ap proximately 8 square centimetres of cloth from the Shroud…This was then reduced to about 7 cm because fibres of other origins had become mixed up with the original fabric …” Given that Giorgio Tessiore, who documented the sampling, wrote: “…1 cm of the new sample had to be discarded because of the pres ence of different color threads.” Given that Teddy Hall, then head of the Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratory, had noticed fibers that looked out of place. Given that a laboratory in Derbyshire concluded that the rogue fibers were cotton of “a fine, dark yellow strand.” Derbyshire’s Peter South wrote: “It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past…” Given that Gilbert Raes, when later he examined some of the carbon 14 samples, noticed that cotton fibers were contained inside the threads, which could help to explain differences in fiber diameter. This may also explain why the carbon 14 samples apparently weighed much more than was as expected. Given that Alan Adler at Western Connecticut State University found large amounts of aluminum in yarn segments from the radiocarbon sample, up to 2%, by energy dispersive x ray analysis. Why aluminum? That was an important question because it is not found elsewhere on the Shroud. Given that the radiocarbon lab at the University of Arizona conducted eight tests. But there was a wide variance in the computed dates and so the team in Arizona combined results to produce four results thus eliminating the more outlying dates (reportedly they did so at the request of the British Museum, which was overseeing the tests). Given that, according to Remi Van Haelst the results failed to meet minimum statistical standards (chi squared tests). Why the wide variance in the dates? Was it because of testing errors? Or was it because the sample was not suffi ciently homogeneous? The latter seems very likely now, and the statistical anomaly indicates something very suspicious about the samples. Given that Bryan Walsh, a statistician, examined Van Haelst’s analysis and further studied the measurements and concluded that the divided samples used in multiple tests contained different levels of the C14 isotope. The overall cut sample was non homogeneous and thus of questionable validity. Walsh found a significant relationship between the measured age of various sub samples and their distance from the edge of the cloth. Though Walsh did not suggest invisible reweaving, it is consistent with his findings. Given this, given Rogers’ findings, given Brown’s observations —– therefore we must be suspicious of the results, scientific methods not withstanding. As Rogers made it clear, the labs didn’t even try to investigate available data and problems. So much for scientific method and thoroughness. Of course I’m biased. I am annoyed that my initial skepticism about the shroud, based on what I thought was good science, was so founded on poor science. I still don’t know if the shroud is real but I know for sure that the 1988 tests cannot be trusted. So don’t lecture me about faith. Perhaps I was unfair to Ramsey in not providing the full context. Thank you for furnishing the link for others. But the fact is, and we can squabble about what direct means, he is in a bit of a bind if that is his take, is he not. Like Ball’s piece, mine is an opinion piece. The dating of the shroud is quite possibly the biggest mistake in carbon dating history. That picture is emerging.

The French Reweaving (a method known by that name, not artisans of a particular nationality — think French fries) was for a repair that was made before the fire. The repair was likely commissioned by Margaret of Austria, Hapsburg princess, Regent of the Netherlands, wife to Philibert II of Savoy and legal custodian of the shroud and the House of Savoy collection of tapestries. The repairs after the fire, which are crude patches, are unrelated to the reweaving. I do blame the labs, the British Museum and church authorities (not the Vatican actually but the Archdiocese of Turin and its Cardinal who was the official custodian for the shroud in 1987). The original protocol called for samples from multiple locations. Church authorities had agreed to this. When it was decided at the last minute to allow only one sample the labs should have walked away. Moreover, the labs didn’t consult with experts about the sampling site and they didn’t do a proper chemical characterization of the sample. I don’t know anyone who is trying to promulgate a first century date without adequate evidence. I happen to believe it, but I don’t know it. I would rather know the truth no matter what the result tells me. Right now, I can’t imagine that it is a medieval fake. As for the 1987 carbon dating, there is enough reasonable doubt to set it aside, to invalidate the results. As for the ENEA report, I have my reservations.

Nor do I support Craig’s assertion that Dawkins, as an Atheist, has no basis for objective moral judgment. And I do not support Dawkin’s fundamentalism of another kind, either (I subscribe to Mc Grath’s views on this). Craig’s fundamentalism is not the point. Hitchens, Harris and many other Atheists of high moral character were well aware of Craig’s somewhat strange views on a specific biblical moral dilemma. Were they less honorable for debating Craig? Were not fellow Atheists urging Dawkins to debate Craig? Could he have not used the issue of the Canaanite slaughter in debate? Of course. Should all people who debate others first consider their views on moral issues? Perhaps a scale of acceptability is needed. Should Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, perhaps not have debated Dawkins because of his Atheism or his beliefs about Christianity? Has not Dawkins said that raising children as Christians was a form of child abuse? The real point about the fist part of the posting was not about Craig’s views regarding the Canaanite slaughter as wrong. It was about the silly excuses that Dawkins gave, particularly the one in which he said he would not debate “a religious person less senior than a cardinal or a bishop.” He wasn’t standing on principle.

The Romans maintained over 60,000 miles of roads that ran from Gaul and Spain all the way to Persia. Across those road traveled spices, dried foods, grains, olive oil, wool, cotton, leather, wood and leather goods, dyes, live animals, human slaves: going to and fro between major cities. Jerusalem was one such city with a population near 50,000 to 80,000 people. All major cities had thriving markets where you could buy goods from all over the known world to support necessities of life and unique cultural lifestyles, as well. One would surely find linen goods, too, for bedclothes, table coverings, draperies and clothing, maybe even for burial shrouds.

Considering this is attempt to produce a definitive Encyclopaedia of the Shroud, a worthy cause, it is a shame that it is illustrated by a map which is admittedly misleading in at least two respects, namely the Templar route to ‘Paris 1307′, which has apparently been discarded, and the position of “Montfort 1418″, which turns out to be in the wrong place. Jones thinks that the Shroud did spend some time in the marked Montfort, but in 1358 1359, after which it moved to Anthon. However he gives no reference for this. The root of the various discussions regarding the Shroud’s movement at this time seems to be M. Bergeret’s Ohio Conference paper on ‘Linceul de Turin – Le Trou Historique’ which says that the Shroud moved to Montfort in 1360 and stayed there till 1389, and Dorothy Crispino’s ‘To know the Truth’ which says that it may have moved directly to Anthon in 1357 and stayed there till 1388. No doubt there are other variations on the theme.While the ruined Castle of Montfort is correctly illustrated, the photo of the Anthon Chateau is at Anthon, Isères, not Anthon, Haute Savoie, and is not associated with Aimon de Genève.Wishing you well, Stephen.Dan Porter.","date":"2015-02-17","mins":"10:10 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2015/02/locations-of-shroud-turin-shroud.html","title":"\nLocations of the Shroud: Lirey c.1355 - Chambéry 1471: Turin Shroud Encyclopedia \n"},{"id":"comment-215794","author":"dan","post":"To who, where, when?.","date":"2015-12-07","mins":"8:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/06/ssg-member-wants-to-know/","cat":"history","title":"SSG Member Wants to Know"},{"id":"comment-164958","author":"dan","post":"When I use the word significant it does not mean I agree with the article or am pleased with it..","date":"2014-10-23","mins":"4:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-165137","author":"dan","post":"It is spreading: Christianity Today, NBC, Daily Mail, Yahoo News,.","date":"2014-10-24","mins":"7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/23/the-guardian-notes-the-history-today-article-by-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"The Guardian Notes the History Today Article by Charles Freeman"},{"id":"comment-69841","author":"dan","post":".","date":"2013-12-29","mins":"11:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/28/the-sciatica-effect/","cat":"history","title":"The Sciatica Effect"},{"id":"comment-69809","author":"dan","post":"Thanks.

Only hydrazine (very slowly) and diimide (a strong powerful reducing agent) could bleach the yellow color of image fibers. This test only show that the color is not a dye and that the color is only at the surface of the fiber. Rogers wrote clearly :” Up until this time, we had assumed that the image color was a result of chemical changes IN the cellulose of the linen; The most likely change would involve the dehydration of the cellulose to produce conjugated double bonds system. Adler’s observations strongly suggested that the cellulose was not involved in image formation”. If the color is only in the pcw, you’ll find exactly the same result because the pcw is a thin surface layer. The cellulose is not involved. The fact that diimide leaves undamaged fibers behind shows only that it can not destroy or modify the strong cellulosic structure of the secondary cell wall. It is not surprising. But, because diimide is able to bleach the colored fibers, the chromophore carrier is likely a non cellulosic structure at the very surface of the fiber. No more no less. It is the same for all the other properties found by the STURP, Rogers etc..regarding the chemistry of the image. To my knowledge there is no known fact able to distinguish between the 2 possibilities. However the fact is that Rogers never wrote the world primary cell wall. Why ? Here we must remember that he was fascinated by the ( true ) fact that the image appears to be more dense in the dark bands than in the light bands. He thought that the bands seen on the Shroud could be explained if there were more impurities left after washing and bleaching in the dark bands than in the light bands. Therefore everything makes sense : dark bands = thick impurity layer = dense image. ALL the impurity layer hypothesis is based on this hypothesis. But the fact is that this hypothesis is very controversial. For example, many textile experts think that the bands can be explained by the heterogeneity of the density of the threads (something which is often observed in ancient fabrics). Dark bands = more threads = more fibers = more “pcw” = dense image and vice versa. In my opinion, Rogers did not even think about the pcw as a possible color carrier because he found very early a complete reliable hypothesis able to explain all the observed facts. This is human. But recently, on the basis of the description of the pcw by some experts, we found (in SSG) that all the known microscopic, macroscopic and chemical properties could be explained if the image were the result of some kind of dehydration oxydation of the hemicellulose found in the pcw. Both hypotheses are possible but the pcw hypothesis does not necessarily imply the complex process required to explain the impurity layer..","date":"2014-04-15","mins":"9:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/15/good-chemistry-questions/","cat":"science","title":"Good Chemistry Questions"},{"id":"comment-151198","author":"dan","post":"A reply from Yannick who is unable to post comments; Message from Yannick: “I note that many people, once again, I’ve not understood the heart of the message I wanted to deliver, which is that the important observations and analyses done by Rogers on his Shroud samples were good enough for him, a chemist expert in determining chemical damages on different types of material, to completely discard all the image formation hypotheses involving any form of energetic radiation and that’s include not only the corona discharge proposed by Fanti or De Liso, the burst of UV light proposed by Di Lazzaro or Jackson, the burst of protons and neutrons proposed by Rinaudo, but also the scorch hypothesis proposed by various skeptics over the years. That’s the main point. The second is this: Unlike what some people have understood, I’m not saying that the Maillard reaction hypothesis (in the form described by Rogers) is THE answer to the image formation, but what I’m fully convinced after years of readings about the Shroud and particularly, after reading with attention and no bias all the writings of Rogers, is this: 1 The image formation must have come from a mild chemical reaction happening at low temperature (and possibly at room temperature). 2 This image formation process must have involved a quantity of “energy” quite small and most probably related to the biological state of the Shroud man’s corpse (and probably also related to its traumatic state). 3 The image chromophore must be located inside a thin and UNEVEN (very important element) layer of carbohydrate impurities instead of being located Inside the structure of the fiber itself (note that this type of carbohydrate coating is, as Rogers said clearly, a type of chromophore much easier to color chemically than the fiber itself, whether we talk about the primary cell wall or the rest of the fiber). And finally, concerning the “P.S.” that you can find at the end of my guess post, I wanted to show people a clear proof that, unlike some other Shroud researchers (I don’t want to name no one), I’m able to change my mind on a particular topic associated with the Shroud if my reflection eventually leads me to a different conclusion than what I first thought. This concerns the fact that I gradually came to reject the image formation hypothesis described by Fazio and Mandaglio IN THE FORM THEY WROTE IT, while it leads me to propose a new hypothesis that has never been proposed before, which is that the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area can well have come from a combination of an image chromophore located only inside a thin and UNEVEN layer of carbohydrate impurities AND (in probably a lesser way) a stochastic process of image formation that involved a so small amount of “energy” that it wasn’t able to color every carbohydrate coated fibers it encountered. If I’m right, that means that out of 3 fibers that were hit by the weak energy (that could have been post mortem gases or something else probably related to the biological and traumatic state of the body), one could have been coated with a good amount of carbohydrate impurities and would have become yellowed through a still undermined chemical process, another one could have also been coated with a good amount of the same impurities but would have remained uncolored because the energy was so weak that it provoked a stochastic result of coloration and a third one could also have remained uncolored, not because of the weakness of the energy involved, but because this particular fiber would not have been coated with enough impurities to produce a visible yellowing on top of the fiber. THAT’S THE 3 MAIN MESSAGES I WANTED TO DELIVER WITH THIS GUESS POSTING OF MINE. Unlike what some people seem to believe, I never intended to “sell” Rogers’ image formation hypothesis (in the form he wrote it) to anyone…”.","date":"2014-09-15","mins":"1:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/14/a-defense-of-ray-rogers-on-the-image-at-the-thread-and-fiber-level/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Defense of Ray Rogers on the Image at the Thread and Fiber Level"},{"id":"comment-127974","author":"dan","post":"Russ, I had lunch with Ray Downing in Manhattan a few years ago.

What assumptions were made about the cloth? To be considered evidentiary,his work must be documented enough to allow questions and criticism. Anyone with the necessary skills should be able to repeat his work precisely and get the same results. That knowledge, ideally, might lead to new thinking about how the images were formed. Did the cloth wrap a body. Probably! That is a reasonable conclusion. It is reasonable unless the image was faked. Colin Berry has proposed that the cloth wrapped a hot statue. He is a good chemist and he does not believe that his hypothesis has been proven unworkable. Many people would agree with that. And what artistic method have we not thought of? We have yet to here from Joseph Accetta yet. Maybe he is onto something. Frankly, I’m quite convinced that the cloth is not from the medieval era in Europe. But what about the early church era in parts of the Byzantine empire. Could there be some artistic method that we don’t know about? The best I can really say is it probably wrapped a body. I believe it did. Moreover I believe it wrapped the body of Jesus. Evidence suggests those beliefs. But beliefs are just that: beliefs..","date":"2014-06-09","mins":"10:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/08/speaking-of-3d/","cat":"3d","title":"Speaking of 3D"},{"id":"comment-99662","author":"dan","post":"I agree..","date":"2014-04-15","mins":"5:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/15/good-chemistry-questions/","cat":"science","title":"Good Chemistry Questions"},{"id":"comment-206658","author":"dan","post":"I think it is the arch anti archers who really don’t see..","date":"2015-07-27","mins":"6:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/26/1999-interview-with-isabel-piczek/","cat":"image_theory","title":"1999 Interview with Isabel Piczek"},{"id":"comment-37296","author":"dan","post":"Max.

However, I’m not a big fan of the Maillard reaction hypothesis. My objection to the decisions made at Valencia had to do with the possible presence of an impurity layer on the fibers which, while necessary for a Maillard reaction, is not the same thing as a Maillard reaction. There seems to be no end to the confusion about this. What troubled me most about Valencia was the way a small handful of scientists tried to rule by small group consensus on a matter on which there was insufficient evidence and no broad scientific agreement. As for the Denis Mannix proposal, it cannot possibly begin to address the subject. Rogers spoke of a complex system. He wrote, in one instance, “I do not push a ‘diffusion model.’ I have presented a complex group of phenomena which, taken together, could produce something with the characteristics of the image.” It is detractors of the Maillard reaction who have dubbed it a mere diffusion model, Fanti in particular. Yet that is all that Denis’ proposal seems designed to test. It is pointless. I strongly recommend reading Yannick’s comments in the next posting, “Speaking of the the Mannix proposal to test the Maillard Reaction” at https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/20/speaking of the the mannix proposal to test the maillard reaction/ Dan.","date":"2012-09-20","mins":"3:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/20/agenda-driven-shroud-science-what-a-pity/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Agenda Driven Shroud Science?

Displaying images on LCD displays introduces additional problems. Finally, our own eyes fool us.

I very much appreciated the letter from the reader that called out the specifics of the issue. 1) The adage that regular photographs and painting never have/can’t have/don’t have 3 D information is inaccurate. 2) The assumption that image density/brightness/grayscale value represents cloth to body distance is just that, an assumption. There are other options. 3) The notion that the image is derived by an interaction between a body and a cloth depends on a cloth body assumption being true. Is that not a form of begging the question? I have never seen controls for the VP8. That would be easy. Hint to the folks in New Mexico. Get your best 3 D projection. Now without touching the VP8 dials and switches AND without touching the camera, particularly the lens (leave aperture and focus settings untouched) do a 3 D projection of a card with calibrated grayscale values and precision line width cross hairs so we can estimated linearity of the calculated height and the amount of smoothing that takes place in the calculation. Does the VP8 have a built in, electronic smoothing/Gaussian blurring function or is it achieved with an out of focus lens. Let’s have a do over. Then let’s do the same with the best new higher definition tools out there like Image J. The 3 D is very mysterious. Let’s stop pushing the mystery and try to understand the mystery with data.

Moreover, I wonder if what I see is a color change to the fiber or a coating, blood, dirt, a yarn defect, banding (bleaching differences) or even a photographic artifact such as a shadow or silver clumping during contrast enhancement (these are not digital photographs) all in some combination. Maybe Gabriel is right that there is software without bias that can determine a statistical probability that what is there is possibly a coin image. I think that we must go back as close as possible to looking at the cloth itself. Can I see the original negatives or high definition unenhanced digital scans of them? Can I see each generation of film to film enhancement with a microscope to see that artifacts are not being generated. Is the enhanceement work precisely documented and reproducible. Right now it is a one time shot in the dark, seat of the pants ehahncement, isn’t it. Maybe another series of enhanceements will produce different results.

Independent observations have proved that all of the image color resides in a very thin layer on the outside surfaces of colored fibers. “Evaporation concentration can explain the superficial nature of the image and the identical properties of the front and back images. It can also explain the “doubly superficial” image, i.e., the presence of a superficial image on the back surface of the cloth as reported by Ghiberti and Fanti and Maggiolo. “When a solution evaporates at the surface of a porous solid, dissolved solutes are concentrated at the evaporating surface. The principle is illustrated in the photomicrograph with blue dye. A piece of linen was saturated with a dilute solution of blue dye, and the cloth was dried while laying on a sheet of Teflon.

In America a moron is someone who is perceptive, bright and very intelligent. I’m sure that is what Ron meant. As for my criticism of how you see what you do, you need to do some research. Don Lynn at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) along with other image analysts studied the images for months. There is no sword image there (yes, I see something that looks like a sword made up of banding lines, creases, dirt, etc.. Nor really are there any confirmed things some people see like flowers, a broom, dice, teeth, coins, nails, etc. I see what looks like flowers, but I see how they are formed by anomolies. Forensic pathologists such as Robert Bucklin and Fred Zugabe have studied the image using large scales hi res life size images. This is the front side and backside of a man on the shroud. It may not be Jesus, as you say, but it is a naked man who appears to be crucified. I can cite dozens upon dozens of peer reviewed scientific journals for you. As humans, we have a very natural ability to see images in random patterns. Frequently, people see patterns with which they are most familiar. Faces are common and hence people often see images of Jesus or Mary on tortillas and grilled cheese sandwiches, in wood grain, in patterns of smudges of all sorts. I see what I am certain is a pareidolia of a sword. That is the word many shroud researchers use: pareidolia. Search this blog (upper right hand corner) for pareidolia. Martin, I will take the time to read some of your blog. We are not rushing to judgment. This blog gets over 1500 or more pageviews per day, mainly on the home page. There are two or three posts per day. We just look rushed. By the way, I like the documentary you recommend because I appear in it. But I don’t agree with some of the things other researchers who also appear have to say. That is the way it is in shroud research. Later today, I hope to present a list (put together by Joe Marino) listing over 2000 primary researchers in the last century, most still active and most legitimate scientists in academia. Donald, I don’t worship the shroud. I have never met anyone who does. I merely want to know what it is, very carefully. Donald, I can probably arrange to get you gigs and gigs of some high res full color, large size images for serious study.

But I am sure you are mistaken in thinking the shroud is a painting. You say what if the tests were redone and it was discovered that the calcium carbonate was gesso instead of dust. How is that determined? Have you consulted a chemist or a microscopist? There are so many other reasons that it is not a painting that it would probably mean nothing. You wonder what it would mean if experts show that the shroud could only have been made of a loom only known in Europe since 1000. Essentially that would be an opinion that the cloth was not more than a thousand years old. That doesn’t make it a painting. I ask you again, Charles: You speak of historical context. Can you thus give an example from anytime in history of a painted negative image that is not copied from a negative image? Hint: a mirror image does not mean the image is a negative image.

I never said that there wasn’t something miraculous going on. Words, indeed, do have meaning. The words dematerialization (of the sort that might produce byproducts to form an image) and commensurate rematerialization imply a process. Going through a door or a wall, or for that matter a floor or a ceiling, implies a process, as well. But it does not necessarily mean de re materialization. And then if we consider the way St. Thomas tells us angels come and go, we have another “miraculous going on” option that does not involve de re materialization. All of this is, of course, pure speculation. In other words there is no reason to infer dematerialization from scripture at the expense of any other possibility. There is a reason to infer something miraculous but  undefined. But…but…but, all this inferring, which may or may not be de re materialization, is valid only if we are assuming a literal reading of scripture. So to use any of it as evidence you must first prove that a literal interpretation is correct and justified. That is tricky and probably impossible..","date":"2015-11-17","mins":"11:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-214737","author":"dan","post":"No it is not.

The cloth – from a cassock John Paul was wearing in 1981 when a gunman tried to assassinate him – was taken in a burglary last weekend. The cloth was found in separate pieces in a garage of one of the three men arrested in connection with the theft. It has been put back together with only a few filaments of gold missing. Police are still looking for the remaining fragments. On Thursday officers had found the gold and glass case in which the relic was held but said the cloth was still missing. But on Friday, Bishop Giovanni D’Ercole told a press conference in L’Aquila that the cloth had now also been found and pieced together. “I think John Paul has forgiven them. I think we have to do the same,” Bishop D’Ercole said. The relic was taken during a burglary of the San Pietro della Ienca church. The three suspects apparently threw the cloth away, not realising its value. A small crucifix that was stolen along with the reliquary has also been recovered. Abruzzo was a place of special significance to the ski loving Pope, who died in 2005..","date":"2014-02-01","mins":"3:29 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/30/how-safe-is-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"How Safe is The Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-7429","author":"dan","post":"Google translation of co’s comment: Salvator Mundi’s eyes have a slight convergent strabismus which have the effect of always looking at us from any position to see.

While I am sympathetic to what you say (I have a daughter who is an OWS protester) I think there is more to the story. Here is a letter from James Cooper the rector of Trinity. I agree with it: From time to time people of goodwill may disagree. We disagree with those who argue that Trinity should–indeed, must as a matter of conscience–allow Occupy Wall Street to liberate its Duarte Square lot at Avenue of the Americas and Canal Street for an open encampment and large scale assemblies. In all good conscience and faith, we strongly believe to do so would be wrong, unsafe, unhealthy and potentially injurious. Trinity has probably done as much or more for the protestors than any other institution in the area. We have provided OWS with meeting rooms and offices for them to assemble, plan and hold private discussions. We have provided pastoral services. We have provided a place of refuge and tranquility at our neighborhood center during open hours where they can rest, use computers, charge cell phones, and use bathrooms. Hundreds avail themselves of these facilities and services every day. It is one simple reflection of Trinity’s inherent concern for our community and for social and economic justice which has been at the heart of the church’s mission for more than 300 years. We want to be responsive, while also being responsible, to our residential and business neighbors, partners, visitors and tenants our entire community. There are no facilities at the Canal Street lot. Demanding access and vandalizing the property by a determined few OWS protesters won’t alter the fact that there are no basic elements to sustain an encampment. The health, safety and security problems posed by an encampment here, compounded by winter weather, would dwarf those experienced at Zuccotti Park. Calling this an issue of “political sanctuary” is manipulative and blind to reality. Equating the desire to seize this property with uprisings against tyranny is misguided, at best. Hyperbolic distortion drives up petition signatures, but doesn’t make it right. Those arrested were not seeking sanctuary; they were seeking to be arrested. Trinity will continue our responsible outreach and pastoral services for all. We appreciate the many expressions of support we have received from so many in the community. –The Rev. Dr. James H. Cooper.","date":"2011-12-23","mins":"5:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/18/occupy-my-local-parish-church/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Occupy my local parish church"},{"id":"comment-148298","author":"dan","post":"Whoops?

Offensive? You don’t have to watch the video. And by the way, I have many Catholic friends who think the priesthood in the Catholic Church should be open to women. Right after 911, Cardinal Egan invited Trinity Wall Street Episcopal Church in New York City to conduct services at the Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton at Our Lady of the Rosary Parish, a Catholic church. Trinity, buried in ash and debris, was closed for months. For many weeks Episcopal priests said high mass in this beautiful Catholic church, officiated sometimes by women priests. Catholic priests, a Catholic organist and other parishioners assisted. Catholic bishops from the diocese visited and on one occasion preached while a woman celebrated mass. No one was offended. I’m sure The Most Right Rev. Michael Curry, the new Presiding Bishop, who is just incidentally replacing a woman Presiding Bishop, meant no offense in preparing that video. And I meant none in showing it here in this blog. You may disagree with the idea of woman being priests. But why are you offended by watching members of another Christian tradition practicing their faith their way?.","date":"2015-06-30","mins":"1:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-205314","author":"dan","post":"Reblogged this on Best of Shroud Story..","date":"2015-07-11","mins":"6:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/29/off-topic-warning-about-the-eucharist-and-then-some/","cat":"off_topic","title":"Off Topic Warning:  About the Eucharist and Then Some"},{"id":"comment-73797","author":"dan","post":"Joe is smart.

In both cases, the lack of single significant credentials is much more than offset by a more important broad area of knowledge.

He may comment and a guest posting is always welcome from Barrie. Like I said, I’m not a lawyer. But I have had this issue explained to me by an attorney who is very familiar with copyright law. You will also notice that Wikipedia Foundation (of Wikipedia) takes this position: “The official position taken by the Wikimedia Foundation is that “faithful reproductions of two dimensional public domain works of art are public domain”. Art? A limiting word? Probably not. A bit more on the 1999 ruling by the U. S. District Court for Southern New York: The Bridgeman Art Library, a private enterprise, makes photographic reproductions of numerous works of art from museums around the world. It is their business. However, a few years ago, the Corel Corporation, a computer graphics software company, used many of Bridgeman’s reproductions to produce an educational CD ROM without seeking permission or paying Bridgeman. Bridgeman claimed copyright infringement. Not only had they purchased rights to some photographs, they had made many of them. In 1999, the U. S. District Court for Southern New York ruled against Bridgeman. The ruling stated that “exact photographic copies of public domain images could not be protected by copyright in the United States because the copies lack originality. Even if accurate reproductions require a great deal of skill, experience and effort, the key element for copyrightability under U.S. Law is that copyrighted material must show sufficient originality.” (quoted from Wikipedia) In other words, if you take a picture of an ancient mosaic, and you give me a copy or you make a copy publically available, I can use it without your permission. Is this fair? You would probably not think so if you are the photographer or someone owning a copyright claim. Bridgeman still makes copyright claims and insists that use of their photographs be licensed. Many such works today, particularly those that are licensed to commercial concerns, contains invisible or visible “digital watermarks,” to detect copying. But that is not very effective. Typical blogging software simply strips away digital watermarks and facilitates automatic cropping, resizing and corrections to contrast and color as thousands of pictures get posted every hour on the Internet. Does Bridgeman vs. Corel apply to photographs of the Shroud of Turin? Perhaps not, for it has not been determined that the shroud is a work of art. But the courts might not see it that way. The precedent established by Bridgeman vs. Corel stipulates that a photograph show sufficient originality. The more accurate the photograph the less copyrightable it is. It is often said that the courts have ruled that “sweat of the brow” (for example, the act of photographing a public domain work) is not the “creative spark” which deserves copyright. I agree with that. Colin was making a different point, altogether. I don’t know how I feel about it. Regardless, I think credit to the photographer is appropriate.

Back then, when this blog was but an experiment, I didn’t give it much attention. And then, before I learned how to manage a blog, I often cut off comments as a way to block spam; to simply have the word “dating” in a posting or comment generates countless, automatically generated spam comments. That may have been why. But I don’t remember. You can be as suspicious as you want. This blog and many sites document adequate reason to call the carbon dating I’m not going to restate them now. But let look at what I might have written to Gore (his text in bold). Exactly where is the data that discredits the Radiocarbon dating. Perhaps discredits is the wrong word. Calls into question is a better way to put it. Have other parts of the Shroud been dated for comparison. Brad knows the answer. I wish they had been (or that they will be. Is cotton vs. Linen the only “evidence”. That isn’t even a good reading of Rogers. Or Villarreal. And the answer is no, anyway. The statistical evidence that the samples are not homogenous raises serious questions. The Blue Quad Mosaic does too. Why aren’t all the subsamples documented and the raw measurements detailed for each. Why wasn’t a full chemical characterization carried out on the samples (Yes, it wasn’t part of the protocol). In other words are we still in need of information. Exactly. And what the notion of a neutron flux at the resurection…as put forward in the issue of Nature with our shroud paper. This is Red Herring. Personally, I think it is ludicrous. In fact, personally, I don’t “believe” that the Resurrection produced any energetic byproducts including light (UV too), heat, electrical, (earth, wind, fire and water, too) that created an image or rejuvenated the C14 content. There we go, now I’ve said it, and I have no words to explain why. But don’t get the idea that I think it is a fake. I don’t. Careful fellow humans for we are without the final truth and in a perfect creation we do not want to give out a dream of our own imagining as a replacement. I have no issue with that. And that is why scientists must listen to historians and philosophers. Maybe the Hungarian Pray Manuscript (just an example) begs us question scientific findings. As one of the original authors of the dating I am still waiting to see something interesting and have remained silent. I see many have a lot to say and seem to know all the secrets of the universe. Besides fragile human ego I see nothing so far. More will be revealed beyond the fragility of human nature …I pray. Is there one person here who thinks he has all the secrets? Anyone with fragile human ego? I don’t think that is a fair criticism. Be suspicious if you want, Colin. I’d be suspicious if I had removed Brad’s comment. He had his say and now that we have thousands of people reading it, maybe someone else will comment as well.

A chilling effect may be caused by legal actions such as the passing of a law, the decision of a court, or the threat of a lawsuit; any legal action that would cause people to hesitate to exercise a legitimate right (freedom of speech or otherwise) for fear of legal repercussions.” Here in the U.S. Chilling effect censorship isn’t very popular. I don’t know about the U.K. As I remind Stephen Jones, I use Fair Use principles and Fair Use law when quoting. Your blogging facility has even created a feature called Blog This to simplify quoting. So has mine, called Reblog. But go for it. You are free to try to define your own copyright rules above and beyond the provisions of the law. You may also file a complaint if you think I am going beyond fair use. You might want to read what Blogspot and Word Press have to say about this. They don’t like chilling effects censorship — nobody does except maybe repressive governments. In fact, Word Press sues and either hosting company may shut down bloggers from their own systems who file unwarranted complaints. You are free to quote me anytime. I stand by what I write. I have no problem with anyone quoting me. Here is a guidelines from the highly respected Electronic Frontier Foundation: Questions About Copyright I found something interesting on someone else’s blog. May I quote it? Yes. Short quotations will usually be fair use, not copyright infringement. The Copyright Act says that “fair use…for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.” So if you are commenting on or criticizing an item someone else has posted, you have a fair use right to quote. The law favors “transformative” uses — commentary, either praise or criticism, is better than straight copying — but courts have said that even putting a piece of an existing work into a new context (such as a thumbnail in an image search engine) counts as “transformative.” The blog’s author might also have granted you even more generous rights through a Creative Commons license, so you should check for that as well. What is fair use? There are no hard and fast rules for fair use (and anyone who tells you that a set number of words or percentage of a work is “fair” is talking about guidelines, not the law). The Copyright Act sets out four factors for courts to look at (17 U.S.C. § 107): The purpose and character of the use. Transformative uses are favored over mere copying. Non commercial uses are also more likely fair. The nature of the copyrighted work. Is the original factual in nature or fiction? Published or unpublished? Creative and unpublished works get more protection under copyright, while using factual material is more often fair use. The amount and substantiality of the portion used. Copying nearly all of a work, or copying its “heart” is less likely to be fair. The effect on the market or potential market. This factor is often held to be the most important in the analysis, and it applies even if the original is given away for free. If you use the copied work in a way that substitutes for the original in the market, it’s unlikely to be a fair use; uses that serve a different audience or purpose are more likely fair. Linking to the original may also help to diminish the substitution effect. Note that criticism or parody that has the side effect of reducing a market may be fair because of its transformative character. In other words, if your criticism of a product is so powerful that people stop buying the product, that doesn’t count as having an “effect on the market for the work” under copyright law..","date":"2014-08-26","mins":"9:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/25/resting-on-our-laurels/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Resting on Our Laurels"},{"id":"comment-204185","author":"dan","post":"So if I am unaware, and I remain unaware because I cannot believe it even though I’m told it, then I may be okay.

In 1900 Ulysse Chevalier apparently had available to him a near finished Latin draft from the Troyes diocesan archives addressed to a Scribe, which would imply that the alleged memorandum was never even sent to the Scribe, let only to Anti pope Clement VII. However rather than producing this draft, Chevalier cobbled together a text from prior separate notes, which included editing marks such as marginal notes, cross outs, and substitute wording, and manufactured for it an end of 1389 date; as by its archival retention it would be clear from the near finished draft for the scribe that the memorandum had not in fact been sent to Clement. Markwardt refers to the two source documents: “In 1993, Hilda Leynen discovered that two distinct drafts of the D’Arcis Memorandum were maintained in the Champagne collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France, one very rough and containing bracketed words, and the other a relatively neat and polished product.” From Chevalier’s cobbled Latin text, Herbert Thurston published an English translation in the Catholic periodical “The Month” in 1903. Wilson 1978 provides the full text of Thurston’s translation as Appendix B, the fraud apparently even escaping Wilson’s attention. The relevant text cited by Markwardt is included in his Note 6: ‘6 The memorandum refers to an alleged investigation conducted, in about 1355, by Henri de Poitiers, Bishop of Troyes. “Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered the fraud and how the cloth had been cunningly painted, the truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or bestowed.” ‘ Wilson makes the point that Latin lacks a definite article, and that the verb used was not “pingere” (to paint) but “depingere” (to copy). Thus the key phrase can be just as easily translated as: “… by an artist who had copied it … ” which sheds rather a different light on the whole bizarre episode. Thus relying on a questionable translation of a fraudulent memorandum may be the stuff by which art historians might make a living, but to others it may seem rather slender grounds for asserting that the origin of the Shroud image was ever an artist’s paint brush! Very likely, D’Arcis’ alleged copy assuming it existed, may have been commissioned by Jeanne de Vergy to replace the original she had taken from St Stephen’s at Besancon for safe keeping and the venerable cleric was confused about the matter. The 1880 assertion that both the Besancon and Piedmont Shrouds were authentic burial cloths beggars belief, would seem to be based on no more than an excessive piety, by 1880 the French Revolution would already have deposed of the Besancon icon, the reverend gentleman would no longer have had access to it, nor would he have had access to the 1898 Pia photography..","date":"2014-11-26","mins":"6:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/24/social-encyclopedia-ing-the-shroud-of-turin-and-channel-5/","cat":"wikipedia_content","title":"Social Encyclopedia-ing, the Shroud of Turin and Channel 5"},{"id":"comment-217287","author":"dan","post":"Reblogged this on Best of Shroud Story..","date":"2015-12-27","mins":"1:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-217304","author":"dan","post":"Goodnight Mrs. Calabash wherever you are..","date":"2015-12-28","mins":"3:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-216718","author":"dan","post":"All postings and all comments associated with them will remain.

The provisions established by Pope John Paul II also allows for married or unmarried male Episcopal priests (now extended to male priests and bishops in the Church of England and the Church of Ireland). These priests may use Anglican worship traditions from the Book of Common Prayer for Mass, which acknowledges apostolic succession. But it is not important. Really! Whatever layman Henry VIII did or did not do (really, it was Elizabeth I who was important here) has no bearing on apostolic succession. Succession is by laying on of hands and cannot be nullified by laity. ‘ It is significant, too, that Benedict XVI considers ++Rowan Cantuar, namely the Most Reverend and Right Honorable Rowan Douglas Williams, to be the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury.

In a study done by Dina Teitelbaum concerning the practice of ossuary burials (link : http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq22102.pdf), she mention the finding of Haas: « Dried herbs were sprinkled afterwards on top of the collected bones. Apparently, people used different spices and ointrnents, for example myrrh and aloes. (note : Bunches of withered flowers were found in ossuaries among bones – Haas, “Giv’atha Mivtarw, 38 40. Spices and embalment rnay have been an act of deference to the deceased, and for improving the srnell; see Zlotnick, Mourninq, 16 1 n.9). » Then, she wrote : « The next citation leads to the conjecture that eventually only dried herbs were permitted: “The bones may be sprinkied with wine and oil.” So Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Simeon ben Nannas says: “Oil, but not wine, because wine evaporates.” “Neither wine nor oil”, Say the Sages, “because these only invite Worms, but dried herbs may be put on them.” Sem 12.9 Following this interesting part of Mrs. Teitelbaum’s paper, I have some good questions for you : 1 Is it possible that the so called flowers and wheat found by Haas were truly what he thought but that it was a very exceptional practice that was only confirm for this specific case? Note : The same good question can truly be asked in the case of the nailing of Jehohanan through the heel bone! 2 Sub questions : In how many ossuaries did Haas found out these botanical species? Beside the tomb where Haas made his finding, are you aware if there were any other botanical discoveries like that in other ancient tombs or ossuaries? 3 Concerning the Jewish quote given my Mrs. Teitelbaum, which indicates that only dried herbs could be sprinkled over the bones, is it possible that, in most cases, this had nothing to do with flowers or wheat, but concerned some particular species of dried herbs (maybe spices more than anything) usually used for burials?” And here’s what he wrote to me: « Shalom, some of this requires me going to a library and remember I left the IAA in 97, due to religious folks changing the laws. As for question one and two, one has to read the entire Haas article in I Ej to see why he is almost never quoted. As for three, there is often quite a difference in what is perceived and what is written in a biblical sense. In ossuaries, we find stones, animal bones, in fact, in one ossuary we found remains of 8 individuals. It was done in a dark cave and whatever wasn’t moving got put in. There is some evidence in but a few ossuaries that some liquid was poured over the bones, but no one ever tried to find which. » After this, I sent him this new email: « Then I must understand that what Haas took for flowers and cereals was surely something else, probably what you say to me (remains of roots or plants that were growing near the tomb). Nevertheless, I have to say that some people to whom I talked about this particular hypothesis of yours have remained skeptical about that… » And here’s the short reply I received from Mr. Zias: « These skeptics have never cleared nor seen an ossuary in situ… ».","date":"2014-10-05","mins":"6:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-11381","author":"dan","post":"I’m on it.

Sub question: If the purpose of placing these things over the eyes was just to make sure they would not open, then again, I ask the question: why doing this while the whole shroud itself was covering all his body, including his eyes? Another sub question, just in case some people think these coins would have been part of a burial ritual: Taking into account the historical fact that coins were placed inside the mouth during Pagan burial rituals, why in the world these Jews would have placed coins over the eyes of the Shroud man instead of in his mouth if they really wanted to perform such a Pagan ritual?

In such a context, we can think they could have used flowers to help remove some bad smells and they could have used « something » (whether it’s coins or pieces of ceramic or something like that) to make sure they wouldn’t see the eyes open when they would re open the cloth. But having said that, I have to underline the fact that these 2 hypotheses must be considered as being highly improbable for at least 2 good reasons : 1 These kind of « procedures » were not part of the First Century Jewish culture when it comes to burial rituals, at the exception of maybe some very scarce examples here and there (which could well have come from very hellenized jews by the way). On that question, sorry but I prefer to rely on the professional opinion of Joe Zias, who is a real Jewish achaeologist who spent all his life diging ancient Jewish tombs than, let’s say, Max Patrick Hamon… Important note about Mr. Zias : I’m fully aware that he’s not at all a partisan of the authenticity of the Shroud, but I don’t see why his opinion on this topic should affect in any way his professional knowledge of the most common Jewish burial procedure in the time of Christ (which did not included the use of flowers, not the use of coins or any other things to cover the eyes of the dead). Also, I need to underline the fact that even if there could be some examples of possible uses of flowers and coins (or any other things covering the eyes) during ancient Jewish burials coming from archaeological findings, these are obviously exceptions that confirm the rule, because, to my knowledge, withered flowers have only been found in one particular tomb (in some ossuaries and not in a burial shroud, which refers to a different part of the whole Jewish burial procedure!) and coins have only been found in 2 different tombs (and they were placed singly inside the mouth and not over the eyes). And concerning the eyes, I’m not aware of any archaeological finding in Israel that would have lead the scientist to conclude that the eyes of the dead were covered with material things to make sure they would not open suddenly… So, in such a cultural context where these kind of burial procedure were surely done only on very rare occasion, I think it’s fair to consider improbable a scenario in which those who would have done the partial preparation of the body would have thought of doing these unusual « procedures »… 2 If there would have been flowers, coins or any other material things over some parts of the Shroud man’s body, including the eyes, then we must expect that absolutely no yellowing of fibers would have happened in these places, because we know for a fact that even a very thin layer of serum was enough to prevent any image formation on the cloth’s surface. Of course, since we don’t knowfor sure what was the real process that lead to the image formation, we must remain prudent here, but in my mind, there’s only one slim possibility that a mild chemical process could have produced at the same time a body image and images of flowers and/or coins on a linen cloth and it’s to think that a yellowing of fibers would have been produced by the interraction of some highly volatile and reactive burial product(s) that would had been sprinkled over the corpse (and therefore, over the flowers and/or the coins or any other thing covering the eyes) just before the end of the partial burial procedure and a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities located on the top surface of the cloth, thus creating not only an image of the body on the cloth, but also images of these flowers and/or coins (or any other thing covering the eyes). In such a scenario, it would be the burial product(s) that would have acted as the sole « catalytic compound » that would have lead to the yellowing of a portion of the topmost fibers of the cloth. But having given you this possible scenario, I must admit that this seems to me as being quite far fetched and that’s why I still believe that this second reason I just gave you is a very good one to think these hypotheses are highly improbable… In the end, it’s evident that, regarding the hypotheses I discussed in my guest post, it’s impossible to be 100% sure about their inaccuracy, considering the present state of our knowledge. To discard them for good, we would need to make an in deep analysis (including a chemical investigation and a very high resolution imagery analysis) of the areas where some people claim to see flower images and coins inscriptions. But having said that, I think the 2 reasons I just gave you are strong enough to at least consider these hypotheses as highly improbable IN THE PRESENT STATE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE. Maybe the future will prove I was wrong of thinking this, but when I consider the known cultural context in which ancient Jewish burials were normally performed (which normally do not included the use of flowers and coins or other things covering the eyes, at the exception of the very scarce examples that archaeologists have found in one or two ancient tombs) and when I consider the fact that even a thin layer of serum located between the corpse and the cloth’s surface was enough to prevent any yellowing of fibers, I’m not ready to change the highly improbable estimation I reached (which must be, I’m sure, better for Max, Hugh, Domenico and some other people than if I said « the probability is equal to absolute zero »). Let’s wait until new direct researches could be done on the Shroud and, at that moment, we’ll surely have a better idea if my estimation was right or wrong…”.","date":"2014-10-05","mins":"6:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-158299","author":"dan","post":"Posted on behalf of Yannick who cannot comment on this site: I’ve read your interesting comment following my guest post and I decided to go ahead and ask Mr. Zias about the particular quote you gave us. Here’s what he just told me via email: « He (Domenico) probably got it from Haas and what he (Haas) mistook for flowers were probably remnants of decayed roots from plants/ trees which had infiltrated from above the tomb. Even today when Jews place flowers on graves here in Jerusalem, the burial society removes them when the mourners have left. » Then, I sent this email to Mr. Zias: « Thanks for your fast answer… So, to complete your thought on this topic, would you say that there is no solid archaeological (and historical as well) indications that the Jews of the first century were using flowers and/or plants during the enshrouding procedure of the body and that there is no more solid indications that they were using these botanical species when they were placing the bones of their deads in ossuaries? I just want to be certain that I understand you correctly… » His reply was short but confirmed that I understood him correctly. He said: « This is correct. » Finally, I sent him one last message: « So, since no flowers or plants were used in ancient Jewish burials, we can say that today’s Orthodox Jews have been able to keep this ancient tradition up until today, right? I say this because it is a fact that in today’s Orthodox Jewish burials, no botanical species are used. » And here’s what he told me (which confort even more my impression that, inside the Shroud, there was only the Shroud man’s body and nothing else): « Correct. In Jerusalem today, it’s much as it was back then : no casket, no embalming, body is washed, wrapped in the shroud, covered, carried on a stretcher and buried. Psychologically i think its healthier, no illusion that one went to sleep as is the case in the US. In fact, here burial costs are picked up by the state whereas in the US costs thousands of dollars to be buried as on co. Bought most of the cemeteries in the US, its thus a monopoly on the burial game. » And here’s one last note concerning the washing procedure : Despite what Mr. Zias just told me concerning the usual washing of the corpse prior to be placed inside a burial shroud, I still believe, like Barbet and other specialists, that in the particular case of the Shroud, the man’s body was still unwashed when he was placed inside the cloth, mainly because of the kind of blood and serum stains we see on the cloth (which came from moistened blood clots and not from liquid blood) and also because of the few traces of dirt that were found in specific areas of the body image….","date":"2014-10-01","mins":"6:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-160131","author":"dan","post":"Posted on behalf of Yannick who cannot comment in this blog: Hi Max! Concerning your questions, I would answer this: Question 1: After having exchanged a lot on the subject with Mr. Zias and after learning the FACT that there’s only TWO CASES where coins have been found in situ inside ancient Jewish skulls, I came to believe (just like Zias by the way) that this must have been a very rare practice in ancient Israel and, personally, I came to the rational conclusion that, in these rare cases where Jews placed coins on the body of their dead (whether it was in the mouth, which seem to be the most common “pagan” ritual, or over the eyes), it is most probably due to the fact that these particular Jewish burials were done by hellenized Jews greatly influenced by pagan culture and pagan beliefs. This seem highly logical to me, because we know for a FACT that, during that era, there really was in Israel some Jews (mostly from the high class by the way, including some members of the Saducees, but most probably not Pharisees, who respected much better their ancient traditions) who adopted the Greco Roman lifestyle. We also know for a FACT that these hellenized Jews were in minority among their Jewish brothers and sisters. In such a context, I think it’s fair to assume that including some pagan rituals in a Jewish burials (like the use of coins and probably also the use of flowers) must have been very rare and must have come, in most cases, from these hellenized Jews. What’s illogical in that kind of reasonning? Question 2: If Zias and other colleagues came to this surprising conclusion, it’s mostly because of the reasonning I just exposed you, which is based on the FACT that, during that period, most Jews were not hellenized Jews and must have been very respectfull of their culture and tradition when it comes to burial procedures, which didn’t normally included the use of flowers, coins or any other object over the eyes. The other basis for such a conclusion comes from the FACT that all these coins were not found in situ but elsewhere in the tombs, except for the cases of the two coins found in ONE skull in Jericho and another one found in ONE skull in Caiaphas tomb. Personally, I think some of these other coins (those not found in situ) can well have been originally placed on the dead, but who can be sure about that? And even if that would be the case, these cases where coins were found in some tombs do not represent a majority, or else, archaeologists would surely have come to the conclusion that the use of coins was common in ancient Jewish burials… The truth is that I’m not aware of any archaeologist expert in Biblical archaeology who believe this pagan practice was common in Israel during the Second temple period. If I’m wrong here, please prove it by giving me some quotes taken from papers or books written by REAL archaeologists expert in Biblical study that would clearly state that this was a common practice among Jews of that time to use coins during their burial procedure… Important note: even if Sir James George Frazer, who was not an archaeologist but an anthropologist and who, unlike Zias, did not digged ancient Jewish tombs in Israel, thought that practice of placing coins or potsherds over the eyes of deceased Jews was common in Antiquity, this is surely not the general opinion defended by the vast majority of Jewish archaeologists and anthropologists today. Just read this quote from Wikipédia concerning Charon’s obol, which represent the general conclusion of modern experts (at least, those not influenced at all by the Shroud) on this topic (which is the roughly the same exposed to me by Zias the other day): “Jewish ossuaries sometimes contain a single coin; for example, in an ossuary bearing the inscriptional name “Miriam, daughter of Simeon,” a coin minted during the reign of Herod Agrippa I, dated 42/43 AD, was found in the skull’s mouth. Although the placement of a coin within the skull is UNCOMMON in Jewish antiquity and was potentially an ACT OF IDOLATRY, rabbinic literature preserves an allusion to Charon in a lament for the dead “tumbling aboard the ferry and having to borrow his fare.” And concerning the specific use of coins over the eyes, here’s another interesting and very telling quote taken from the same Wikipedia page, which express, once again, the most common conclusion among experts: “Only RARELY does the placement of a pair of coins suggest they might have covered the eyes. In Judea, a pair of silver denarii were found in the eye sockets of a skull; the burial dated to the 2nd century A.D. Occurs within a Jewish community, but the religious affiliation of the deceased is UNCLEAR. Jewish ritual in antiquity did not require that the eye be sealed by an object, and it is debatable whether the custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead was practiced among Jews prior to the modern era. During the 1980s, the issue became embroiled with the controversies regarding the Shroud of Turin when it was argued that the eye area revealed the outlines of coins; since the placement of coins on the eyes for burial is not securely attested in antiquity, apart from the one example from Judea cited above, this interpretation of evidence obtained through digital image processing CANNOT BE CLAIMED AS FIRM SUPPORT for the shroud’s authenticity.” Question 3: Read again my recent post: “I’m fully aware that he (Zias) is not at all a partisan of the authenticity of the Shroud, but I don’t see why his opinion on this topic should affect in any way his professional knowledge of the most common Jewish burial procedure in the time of Christ (which did not included the use of flowers, not the use of coins or any other things to cover the eyes of the dead).” On the contrary, when it comes to questions directly related to the Shroud, I’m much more prudent versus what he can think or conclude… But on the particular topic concerning the question of whether or not flowers and coins were commonly used in ancient Jewish burials (which is a topic not directly in link with the Shroud), I have no reason to doubt his professional opinion. Note also that, in my recent post, I do not reach the kind of drastical conclusion Zias reached when it comes to the Shroud… In other words, Zias would say something like: “The use of flowers and coins was not part of the common Jewish burial in the time of Christ; therefore there is SURELY no images of things like that on the Shroud”, while I conclude this instead (which is a much more “balanced” and “open” conclusion): “Maybe the future will prove I was wrong of thinking this, but when I consider the known cultural context in which ancient Jewish burials were normally performed (which normally do not included the use of flowers and coins or other things covering the eyes, at the exception of the very scarce examples that archaeologists have found in one or two ancient tombs) and when I consider the fact that even a thin layer of serum located between the corpse and the cloth’s surface was enough to prevent any yellowing of fibers, I’m not ready to change the highly improbable estimation I reached.”.","date":"2014-10-07","mins":"10:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/29/hello-mr-zias/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Hello Mr. Zias"},{"id":"comment-8549","author":"dan","post":"Colin, we’ve been here before.

Some look to the shroud for reassurances about their beliefs in the incarnation and the resurrection. Some people, frequently fundamentalist Protestants, find that deplorable. Others look to NDE/ODE experiences for similar reassurances. And, of course, some find that deplorable even as NDE books are becoming a best selling genre. I find neither subject positively reassuring or deplorable for my faith journey. Both are interesting. I knew a Catholic priest who would go on and on about the faith inspiring value of the shroud; but mention ND Es and he almost foamed at the mouth calling the subject heresy. A good friend of his, a devout Presbyterian minister, felt just the opposite. In the two subjects they found common ground and they loved to argue about both subjects. They are subjects that many scientists claim are scientific while numerous other scientists claim otherwise.

Oh, yes, some of us may have pet theories, favorite hypotheses. Some of us day dream about possibilities – the mustard seed of science. We have taken up the challenge and so far have failed. We don’t know how the image is formed. Nor do you. We admit it freely. You do not. What have you done? You’ve scorched some linen. You’ve shown that it can produce a negative image. Good start. But can scorching produce a superficial image? You have tried to show that it can by scorching an onion skin, easily 1000 times as thick as the image, placed over a piece of linen and shown that the linen underneath was not scorched. That experiment is fraught with so many problems that it cannot even be thought of as a scientific experiment. (One might even suspect that there was some confusion between microns and nanometers). On the other hand Di Lazzaro showed and explained why scorching could not produce a superficial image on a fiber. Unable to criticize his work, you, like the creationist scientists who ignore fossil records while claiming that dinosaurs walked the earth among the offspring of the biblical Adam and Eve less that 10,000 years ago, have decided to simply ignore factual scientific observations. You write, “If you can’t, then stop expressing surprise and dismay that I should continue to assert that we are looking at a contact scorch. Instead be thinking of ways of verifying or falsifying an entirely reasonable and rational proposition.” Surprised, yes; dismayed, no. We have suggested many ways to verify your assertion that it is a scorch. You tried to get away by telling us that it was up to us to prove you wrong. Wrong! (One might even suspect that there was some confusion between falsifiability and falsificationism). It is simple, my friend. Provide evidence of 1) a fiber scorched by your methods that is scorched only to a depth of 200 nanometers, 2) a yarn segment which is also superficially scorched only to a depth of two or three fibers, 3) a piece of linen cloth that is scorched on the reverse side as well as the front as is the case with the hair and mustache of the man whose image is “somehow portrayed” on the shroud, 4) a bit of scorch image removed from the surface of linen cloth by sticky tape, 5) a scorched image on cloth that is extremely faint or an explanation that is more than unscientific speculation as to how the scorch faded with time and 6) a demonstration of shading by scorch that replicates the halftone effect seen in the shroud. Colin, unless you can demonstrate most of these characteristics experimentally and not by verbal contortionism , I am far more inclined to think that Leonardo da Vinci created the shroud with proto photographic methods and I’m about 100% certain that he didn’t..","date":"2012-03-18","mins":"5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/17/welcome-to-colin-berrys-new-straw-shedder-blog/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Welcome to Colin Berry’s new Straw Shedder blog"},{"id":"comment-9440","author":"dan","post":"Google translation: The conspiracy theory was favored by the attitude and declarations of the heads of the laboratories themselves …… The Zurich laboratory for the BBC prepared a photo montage showing IMPOSSIBLE samples and subsamples were dated.

You wrote, “There was definitely no intention to exclude any of the major contending image formation theories from consideration.” In my reply to you at SSG I wrote, “It is not about a favorite body image hypothesis.” I repeated the sentence three or four times throughout the letter. I used the word favorite because you had used the word favorite instead of major as you now do. I tried to make it clear that it is about the impurity layer that Rogers concluded was on the fibers. I think Yannick makes this clear as well. Impurity layer, which is a characteristic, does not necessarily mean a Maillard reaction, which is a body image formation hypothesis. Nor, for that matter does a Maillard reaction necessarily mean that an impurity layer of starch and saccharide is required. Isn’t that what Paolo Di Lazzaro was trying argue? David, characteristics of the image, whatever they are, ultimately dictate what image formation theories/hypotheses are acceptable. You don’t exclude or include hypotheses when literally report characteristics. You report observed characteristics, which should be factual. Now it may be that there are differences of opinion. Some SSG scientists have claimed that the image that was formed lies very superficially within the fiber. Others have claimed, Ray Rogers most notably, have claimed that the image that was formed lies within a very superficial impurity layer of starch and sugar. In other words there is no consensus on the statement that reads: “The body image is created by molecular change of linen fibres.” Yes there is a consensus by a cabal of a few scientists who met in Valencia. But the public is not going to accept that. And Dawkins after a few minutes of Googling by one of his volunteers is not going to accept it. Their commentary is likely to be that people behind the challenge don’t know what they are talking about or are promoting a one side view. The correction to sentence one should be “The body image is created by molecular change of linen fibres or to a chemical impurity layer adhering to the fibers.” You say that I rejected your offer to go back to the signatories or whatever they are. I didn’t. Go back. But it is not about a favorite or major image formation hypothesis. It is about the impurity layer. Go back. Discuss it. Get consensus on the non consensus. I have not objection to that. What I also stated is my objection to science by consensus and the foregoing is why. Science should be driven by facts. And if there are differences of opinions about what is factual, then and until they can be ironed out, openness and candor must be the norm. It is easy to get a small number of scientists together and present a consensus about just about anything. How different would be the consensus about the Anthropic Principle by a dozen or so members of the Society of Ordained Scientists and a dozen or so scientist members of the Council for Secular Humanism. Tell me the consensus group from Valencia isn’t a group of scientists who are not perceived to have a bias. Permit me to quote Jos Verhulst who, in regard to this matter, wrote: “But there nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong, with this lacking of a ‘consensus’. If people want to debate the shroud, they should do so as rational individuals, with each individual thinker pondering the evidence and developing careful reasoning. That’s all that there is to a scientific discussion. Thinking that the position of a protagonist moves somehow closer to the truth, or becomes more trustworthy or reliable, when it is backed by a ‘consensus’, is completely absurd. ‘Consensus’ is for those who believe, not in the power of truth and reason, but in the power of number and amount.

Ray Rogers was a charter member of the Coalition for Excellence in Science Education in New Mexico, which stressed the importance of teaching evolution in the schools. He was strongly against teaching creationism in the schools and actively lobbied against it. In one case he wrote a rather strong letter to the editor of the Los Alamos Monitor, the city’s local newspaper. R. N. Rogers 10 Jan. 1997 The Los Alamos Monitor Editor: Sig Hecker is the director of the most famous laboratory in the world, certainly the laboratory that has had the largest effect on humanity’s perception of science since the beginning of recorded history. This is The Laboratory that has shown people that they must take the effects of science seriously. It is also one of the laboratories that could teach the world just what science is and what they can expect from it. I have reason to believe that Sig Hecker is an exceedingly poor choice to represent science. The public largely does not understand exactly what science is, and there appears to he a strong desire not to be compelled to find out either in school or by personal study. A significant fraction of the public has a deep hate for what they think science is. Another fraction feels that its beliefs are threatened. Both groups have launched assaults on science, and the people who love science cannot believe that it is happening. It is! We have seen a very practical result in the State Board of Education that will have long term effects. Science is not “things.” It is a way of thinking. Classical Scientific Method is simply a method for objectively applying logic to the solution of problems. 1) The problem must be stated in clear terms, and obscure words must be defined clearly. The goal sought must also be stated clearly. 2) Everything known about the problem must be studied, and all references must be acknowledged. There must be no “hidden facts,” and it is not clever to “blind side” the opposition. Carefully planned observations should be made. Different methods of observation should be made when possible, and results must be checked for internal consistency and agreement with reported results. All observations must be taken seriously, until some justifiable and clearly stated reason can be found to eliminate any. 3) A “brainstorming” session, preferably with other workers familiar with the problem, should try to develop as many potential explanations (hypotheses) as possible (Method of Multiple Working Hypotheses), All hypotheses must be clearly stated. And 4), all of the hypotheses must be tested equally against the same, complete list of observations and facts. Testing may often involve making predictions on the basis of the hypotheses and testing the predictions by experiment. The Principle of Parsimony (Occam’s Razor) states that the hypothesis that includes the largest number of facts and observations will be closest to the truth. Hypotheses that do not accept many facts without “special pleading” should be discarded. We are now living in a time when the special pleadings have assumed more importance than the facts. An approach that does not include the components of Scientific Method is not “science.” A well tested hypothesis, for which no exceptions have been found, is called a “theory.” The word “theory” in science does not connote “speculation.” Creationists misuse the term to confuse the public. I asked Sig Hecker for help in the defense of science. He has, after all, espoused excellence in science” as his fundamental desire for the laboratory. With regard to creationism, his response was the following: “The lab has no official position on creationism. The media have tried, several times to get me to take a stance, and I have refused.” I suppose that a large government financed scientific organization must be politically correct. It might not be good for the careers of scientific managers to propose an official position on something like science. An individual scientist, however, might be expected to make continual application of classical Scientific Method. He would be expected to keep “truth” as his primary goal. He would be expected to defend his methods under peer review. I believe that Sig’s refusal to make a personal statement on creationism is his scientific position. If the laboratory is managed by creationists who still profess to be scientists, they should be willing to present all of their facts for public scrutiny. If they are not willing to do this, I believe that higher authorities should return the laboratory to scientific management as quickly as legally possible. Persons who value science should insist on it. R. N. Rogers Here is another letter. Any questions now about where Rogers stands? R. N. Rogers 17 Jan. 1997 The Los Alamos Monitor Editor: John Baumgardner’s response to my letter attributes statements to me that I did not make. I was advocating classical scientific method as the best approach to the solution of problems. I did not advocate or even mention atheism. I did not advocate any control over religious expression. Religion is “revealed”: The body of knowledge in science is developed by application of a specific logical process. The two operate in different spheres. Science and atheism are two different things. Trouble comes when a person attempts selectively to accept or deny scientific observations primarily on the basis of religious beliefs. By definition, a “scientist” is a person who uses scientific method. Like Caesar’s wife, a scientist must be above suspicion. The more “renowned” the scientist, the more careful he should be. I was accused of proposing atheism as official policy for the laboratory. I was accused of advocating control over free religious expression. Those are serious accusations. I did neither. The Greeks classified logical fallacies over two thousand years ago, and many fallacies appear in attempts to circumvent honest application of scientific method on any topic. Baumgardner’s accusations against me are a good example of an argument ad hominum, with which you attack a person rather thrums logic (common in politics). Invocation of great theist scientists seems to have as its unstated conclusion that “therefore, creationism is true.” True science should not use hidden premises; however, the type of argument used involves the non sequitur fallacy (argumentative leap). The most common fallacy I see used is “begging the question”: The argument assumes as true what it needs to prove. Hundreds of years of observations and measurements by thousands of scientists have provided the basis for the scientific theory of evolution. Has all of that been a conspiracy? Back to begging the question, can anyone prove that “science has falsified evolution” without first accepting the premise that God created everything, most things, some things, or (fill in the blanks)? In science you state your hypotheses and premises, and I have yet to see all of the creationist premises and/or hypotheses clearly stated. Incidentally, I hated to use the word “theory.” Its use by creationists illustrates another fallacy, the fallacy of equivocation. This involves the deliberate use of the same word or phrase in more than one sense. A scientific theory is more solidly established than a hypothesis. The theory of evolution has seen an amazing process of accretion of facts since it was first proposed, and it has proved to have predictive value. The fallacy of composition has often been used in attempts to disprove evolution. It involves the suggestion of some doubt and the application of that doubt to the attempted destruction of an entire body of knowledge. Each doubt must be critically analyzed, and I do not see that being done. Is it necessary to disprove anything to prove God? Do warped logic and outright lies support God? I admit that I have not read Behe’s book. I have, however, had a son who worked in Melvin Calvin’s laboratory at Berkeley, and I have read many of Calvin’s works. Calvin wrote Chemical Evolution, and he got a Nobel Prize. I have not seen any creationist work of similar stature. Perhaps a corporate philosophy that allows a lack of scientific rigor explains the lack of Nobel Prizes at Los Alamos. I would have to see some scientific analysis of creationists’ claims, made by creationists with rigorous methods, before I organized a symposium with them. I do not enjoy illogical polemics and vague claims. With or without scientific, method, I suggest most strongly that John Baumgardner watch very closely what he says or writes about any scientist R.

No wonder you end up with something that looks rather mysterious! It doesn’t matter that the images are on the outer fibrils. It doesn’t matter if the images have faded or not. It is not a matter of making a photographic negative and ending up with something that look rather mysterious. If anything it is the other way around. Charles, the images on the cloth are negative images. What that means, if your painted image hypothesis is to be thought valid, is that 1) an artist painted a negative image or 2) an artist painted a positive image that as it faded (or is it as the paint flaked off) became a negative image. There is no evidence that this has ever happened in the history of art. Moreover, option 1 is near impossible to do and option 2 would be a startling scientific phenomenon. Actually if you could explain how option 1 is doable or option 2 is scientifically possible, you might have something. Otherwise, your hypothesis is baseless. Which is it? That is a simple question. Again, some other questions come to mind: In defense of your hypothesis, do you know what Secondo Pia discovered in 1898? Can you describe the difference between a mirror image and a negative image? Do you have any evidence of a painted grey scale negative image at any time in the history of art?

Chapel Stained Glass Artists Have International Reputation Bishop Manogue has been graced with the works of remarkable and internationally famous artists, the sisters Isabel and Edith Piczek. Both sisters were born in Hungary. They were friends of Sister Ida, Foundress of the Sacred Heart Sisters who provided years of ministry in the Diocese of Reno. Isabel, our principal contact, won a national competition for painting at a very early age, and at thirteen she decorated her first church with stained glass. Young Isabel, a Catholic, got herself into religious conflict with the communist government of Hungary and had to flee her country, accompanied by Edith, her sister and colleague. Almost immediately after her arrival in Rome, she won the International Grand Award for Painting and another competition to paint a 400 square foot fresco mural at the Vatican’s famous Pontifical Biblical Institute. She spent three years in Rome. During this time she completed another 42 murals at the Precious Blood Monastery of Rome and elsewhere. She also pursued her other interest, particle physics. Leaving Rome, Isabel came with her sister to the United Stated and with her she established her art studio, the Construction Art Center in Los Angeles. To date she has completed huge murals, mosaics, ceramic tile murals and stained glass windows for 493 churches and public buildings in seven countries on three continents. In addition to her outstanding work in the Bishop Manogue chapel, some of Isabel’s major works can be found at the St. Thomas Aquinas Cathedral and Our Lady of Snows parishes in Reno; the Guardian Angel Cathedral in Las Vegas; the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.; Holy Cross Mausoleum in Culver City, California; Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, California; and numerous other buildings in California, Rome, Canada, Illinois, New Mexico and elsewhere. Ms. Piczek is also an internationally known expert on the Shroud of Turin. She has appeared many times on national television..","date":"2015-10-16","mins":"2:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"id":"comment-165913","author":"dan","post":"Last warning.

Isabel Piczek (born 1941) is a Hungarian born ecclesiastical artist and physicist, perhaps best known for her study of the Shroud of Turin, and who currently lives in Los Angeles. Her sister, Edith Piczec, was also a noted religious artist. Piczkc, as with her sister Edith, was born in Hungary, where her father was a noted artist and art professor, and graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest. After World War II, however, the sisters fled to Rome during the Communist regime to pursue their work in sacred art. There, whilst still only teenagers, they won a 1949 competition to paint a mural at Rome’s Pontifical Biblical Institute. By 1955 they were in Canada and shortly after arrived in Los Angeles to pursue their combined talents. In Las Vegas, Edith designed the 2,000 square foot mosaic on the façade of the cathedral that illustrated the roles of the Guardian Angel.[1] In 1992, Piczek was honoured by Pope John Paul II in recognition of her prolific artistic achievements, examples of which can be found in nearly 500 different cathedrals, churches and other buildings across the world.[2] Cardinal Roger Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles, conferred on Piczec admission into the Pontifical Order of Saint Gregory, and the title Dame of Saint Gregory, whereby she became one of only 70 Knights and Dames throughout the world who hold this honour.[3].","date":"2015-10-16","mins":"2:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"id":"comment-165907","author":"dan","post":"Max, I have over 200 spam comments this morning, mostly people trying to sell stupid stuff or lure people to gambling sites, etc. “My brother told me about your blog.

Most of my main targets are in my own church. (Does that make me “anti Anglican”?) In the quest to speak clearly about eschatology, classic Roman Catholicism is a friend and ally. Among my greatest encouragers has been Gerry O’Collins, formerly of the Gregorian University. When I taught there as a happy guest six years ago, including being introduced to the man Neuhaus calls “John Paul the Great,” I don’t think anyone would have noticed the slightest tinge of anti Catholicism. Indeed, some of my Reformed critics regularly accuse me of being far too friendly to Rome, but that is another story. More poignantly, on my last visit to a dear but sick friend, before his untimely death, I found him reading Surprised by Hope , and he professed himself delighted. He was Kevin Dunn, my “opposite number” and occasional golf partner, the late Roman Catholic bishop of Hexham and Newcastle. Nor was I “refuting Catholic ecclesiology” when I quoted Douglas Farrow”and neither was I ignorant of the fact that Doug, a good friend these past twenty years, has recently converted to Roman Catholicism. Doug was rightly attacking a particular form of ecclesial triumphalism, which occurs in many traditions, including some parts of Catholic tradition at some, not all, periods in history”but also occurring, particularly, in various types of liberal Protestantism. In any case, that part of the book was hardly central or particularly load bearing for the whole. More important, I was not attempting to claim that the present pope was coming round to my way of thinking or that I was offering him “tutelage.” I was merely noting, as anyone familiar with Cardinal Ratzinger’s work surely knows, that in his 1977 book Eschatology , he offers a remarkable account of purgatory in terms of the fire spoken of in 1 Corinthians 3 and states that this fire, which is a metaphor for the all consuming meeting with Christ himself, “cannot be quantified by the measurements of earthly time.” This is a careful and explicit rejection of some aspects of what some Roman Catholics had sometimes taught in earlier times” just as he refers to “what were in part objectionable and deformed practices,” presumably meaning the sale of indulgences and the like. In other words, Ratzinger was arguing, long before I started writing on this subject, (a) that traditional expressions of purgatory in terms of a linear, temporal progression are mistaken; (b) that at or after death the redeemed person meets with Christ in a moment of fiery judgment that burns away all the dross, and that this is what the traditional language of “purgatory” is attempting to refer to; and (c) that the Reformers were right to react against some practices that had grown up around the doctrine as some people taught and perceived it at the time. All I was doing was hailing this fine piece of work by a great Roman theologian of our day. As for suggesting that I would do well to consult the pope’s new encyclical, Spe Salvi , and what it says about purgatory”well, Neuhaus should himself read not only what the encyclical says about purgatory (since it repeats exactly the argument Ratzinger had made thirty years earlier) but also my grateful comments on that encyclical in The Tablet last December. Do your homework, Neuhaus, I wanted to say again and again. Why should Neuhaus imagine such unseemly and pervasive anti Catholicism? He thinks it is because I “must justify [my] separation from the centering authority of the ancient Church.” How bizarre. Of course, I know that many people brought up in the Germanic world, presented with a stark choice between a very Protestant (and latterly existentialist) Lutheranism and a traditional Catholicism, found themselves facing that sort of question. As Neuhaus said to me over lunch recently, many good Lutherans are taught to remind themselves every day why they are not Roman Catholics.

Let me address your comments in reverse order. 3)Joe Marino is a good friend. He is a frequent contributor to this blog. Note a posting this morning comes from him: Another Enduring Belief Question: Jesus in the Nude He has been the source of most of the material about the St. Louis Conference. Search this blog on St. Louis for several postings. I don’t think it is a SSG hosted conference. 2) I think the real problem is that there simply isn’t a good basis for saying that bloodstains are undisturbed. With centuries of rolling, folding, displaying, etc. It is hard to justify. Let me see one picture that is clearly not possibly just a worn down bloodstain. 1) Perpendicular radiation? What makes it perpendicular? How does this work? Radiation, by the way, is natural. Only the source of it is in question. Miraculous is it? Wouldn’t 100% miraculous nonenergetic information transfer and molecular chemical change work just as well? Why depend on an accidental byproduct of a miracle? If it is not accidental but purposeful why not just go for another miracle? Philosophically, Jackson, Fanti, et. Al. Don’t make sense? Theologically, they don’t make sense. Scientifically, they don;t make sense. I think the image is real but I don’t see sufficient evidence from anyone in SSG or anywhere else for any explanation of the image. Not yet.

What we do here is argue. Everything should be scrutinized. As for peer review, most of what is being claimed to have been peer reviewed lately is pure pay to play vanity publications. I was not aware that the majority of SSG members “agree the shroud had to some how achieve somewhat of a stiff plane like unwrapping to give such a perfect photographic image.” I have been a member of SSG since day one and I very much doubt that claim.

I take my statement about the shroud being controversial from pp. 105 106 of the Free Press Paperback reprint. Note in the quotation the phrase “carbon dating technique.” And I agree. It is good science. And in the case of the shroud it was good science done poorly. If Dawkins had been well informed about the objections to the radiocarbon dating – not fire caused contamination but evidence of material intrusion probably from reweaving – he could have given a better account. Notice he avoids the question of sampling altogether. Is there no one other than you with the courage and/or the comprehension of good scientific practices to proclaim that each and every one of the 1988 scientists should have walked away from the single sample. Dawkins comes out looking dull. David Goulet suggests striking it. I probably will. Or I may expand upon it to show how imprecise Dawkins is. (I’ll probably strike it). Maybe I should change it to even Colin Berry thinks the scientists should have walked away from a single sample (just kidding, but yeah!). Here is the quote from the book: “. . . When mass spectrometry made it possible to date a tiny sample of the shroud, rather than the substantial swathes that would have been needed before, the Vatican allowed a small strip to be cut off The strip was divided into three parts and sent to three leading laboratories specializing in carbon dating. In Oxford, Arizona and Zurich. Working under conditions of scrupulous independence — not comparing notes — the three laboratories reported their verdicts on the date when the flax from which the cloth had been woven died. Oxford said AD 1200, Arizona 1304 and Zurich 1274. These dates are all — within normal margins of error — compatible with each other and with the date in the I 350s at which the shroud is first mentioned in history. The dating of the shroud remains controversial, but not for reasons that cast doubt on the carbon dating technique itself. For example, the carbon in the shroud might have been contaminated by a fire, which is known to have occurred in 1532. I won’t pursue the matter further, because the shroud is of historical, not evolutionary, interest. It is a nice example, however, to illustrate the method, and the fact that, unlike dendrochronology, it is not accurate to the nearest year, only to the nearest century or so.” Let’s look at the important part of the above. “The dating of the shroud remains controversial, but not for reasons that cast doubt on the carbon dating technique itself,” He is talking about the technique, the science, ‘to illustrate the method.” But the dating remains controversial. Why? Because of poor quality use of the otherwise good technique. As for capitalizing Atheist, I am much convinced by a good friend, an Atheist himself, who generally prefers that the word be capitalized in the same way that Christian is capitalized – a member of a class of people. I understand your comparison to theist. I also understand that the an ample majority of writers do not capitalize atheist. I believe the Chicago Tribune Style Guide allows both. We could toy with many words like Catholic, Orthodox, Evangelical. When I do capitalize atheist, I do it out of respect as I do for someone who is Muslim or Jewish or an Epicurean. We have bigger issues. As for my experiment with the Best of, it is just that, an experiment.

The Muslims believe Jesus was crucified, but survived death and therefor was not resurrected. However this is a great deception by the enemy and will stop millions from being saved.” I happen to be a Christian. I believe in the Resurrection. I don’t believe that a loving God will “stop millions from being saved” because of what they believe if indeed they are “loving and caring people.” In fact, I don’t think “this is a great deception by the enemy” but that thinking it might be just might be.
