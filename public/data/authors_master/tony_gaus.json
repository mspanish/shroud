{"art":[{"id":"comment-28005","author":"tony_gaus","post":"On May 20, 2011 I was on my way home from a hooters bar with a waitress from there and she was very intoxicated. I was not wearing my seatbelt and she was driving at speeds over 100mph in an SUV. As we approached a toll, I realized she was in the wrong lane and when I told her to get over she jerked the wheel. We began to spin out of control and the past thing I remember is a jersey barrier smashing into my door. I was thrown over 100ft. Away from the vehicle and was life flighted. I suffered broken skin on the right side of my head where you could see my skull, skin torn from my trapezius muscle down to mid bicep on my right arm and the right side of my face was torn off. The doctors said it was a miracle that I survived let alone walk away with no brain damage nor any broken bones. My face healed tremendously with no scarring, the only remnants that was left was some scars on my hands, shoulder and where the side of my head was gauged. What could possibly explain that other than an act of God? The real kicker is that I shared a room with a guy who was shot point blank in the face with a bad round from a .44 revolver, the bullet went into his cheek and left through his eyebrow, missing his eye and brain. He only had to get reconstructive surgery to repair his eye socket. God is great. I’m thankful everyday for the second chance I have received. God bless..","date":"2013-03-21","mins":"6:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
