This relic is ovbiously a painting. \nI am an artist who has studied the old masters techniques and materials and after looking at the image of OLOG it became clear to me that this supposidly holy relic was a simple painting. \nIt always puzzled me why OLOG was created in what was clearly a Renasaunce style. Did OLOG have a preference for that way of presenting herself if so why? \nI took up the challange to see just who could have painted such a portrait. I looked at the date that the painting was made and then made some comparisons with artists works who were doing art of that type in Europe.\nI was convinced that the painting was commissioned by the bishop and produced in Eurpoe as Mexican art of the time was clearly not of that style.\nAlso comming from Europe would have given a lot of cover as to the Identity of the artist. \nIt was common in the early chruch in Mexico to import painting and statuary from Europe as a way of teaching the population about Christianity. The art style of the Mexican people which was popular at that time is called Retablos a much simpler style, certianly not Renasaunce. \nafter several hours of looking at the works of artists that were popular in europe at the time on the internet I notice that there were several who could have done this painting. but clearly one or two looked most likely. Unfortunately I didn’t have the time or interest to take it further. \nAn Art Historian like Mr. Allen could probably make short work of this project and debunk another tool of deception used by the Catholic Church.\n\n","date":"May 23, 2009 at 6:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die"}]}
