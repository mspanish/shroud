The false color photographs are not intended to be interpreted chemically. They are subjective evidence for the non-uniformity of the shroud materials, supported by the findings or cotton in the test area.  The shape or size of a patch is not at issue. Combined with the historical evidence that dates the shroud to before 1260, and valid concerns about dating ancient textiles (e.g. British museum mummies), the point is that the C14 date is now questionable.  More evidence could be found by microscopic study of the sample area, a non-destructive test.  The coincidence of the 14th century date could just as easily be considered a case of selection bias: the labs got the date they were hoping for, so they ignored the obvious gradient in their results.  Any bachelor’s level engineering student could tell us that a gradient means the data is incomplete, and needed information lies outside the test boundaries.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2015 at 9:56 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"}],"events":[{"author":"matt_kowalski","post":"Watching Barrie on EWTN right now.  I’ve been meaning to comment on something I learned in engineering school decades ago (Northwestern).   When test results give a gradient, such as the C-14 dates of the four sample pieces, any engineer worth his salt would agree the test is incomplete.  The C-14 dates smoothly rise with linear location, i.e, C-14 content is a function of vertical location.  More tests need to be done beyond the boundary where the sequence ends, or the results are invalid. Because if C-14 is a linear function, the samples are not randomly chosen. (We all know why they were chosen there anyway.)\n\n","date":"November 6, 2013 at 9:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/06/barrie-on-ewtn-liveand-again-in-repeats/","cat":"event","title":"Barrie on EWTN, Live–and again in repeats"}],"image":[{"author":"matt_kowalski","post":"Ordinary photographs may have some 3d information, but it is distorted by the directionality of the light source.  The relatively undistorted 3d information found on the shroud can be duplicated by photographing a white statue immersed in colored water, but the fact remains that the shroud image is different from most photographs.  One might describe it it as resembling a perfectly “light balanced” photo. Or perhaps similar to an expertly drawn NEGATIVE charcoal sketch in which the artist masterfully faded the boundaries of the figure.  I understand why Colin Berry wants to pursue contact theories, but everything he has suggested so far was tried and abandoned long ago by other researchers.\n\n","date":"August 10, 2015 at 5:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/10/it-is-really-really-time-to-rethink-what-we-think-about-3d/","cat":"image_theory","title":"It is really, really time to rethink what we think about 3D"}],"misc":[{"author":"matt_kowalski","post":"Wasn’t there a prize of something like $20,000 for somebody to produce a duplicate of the shroud with certain authentic properties?  offered a few years ago I recall.

But besides the problems Prof Porter mentions, there is also the fact that the shroud image is not made up of various shades as a monochrome photo. It is shaded like a pencil or charcoal drawing, made entirely of a uniform dark color dispersed on a light background. And yet it has detail similar to a photo, which would take an amazing artist to pull off.\n  A second problem is the lack of light directionality in the shroud image. This is easy to see by comparing it to the well-known “photo shroud” made by Prof. Allen.  The photo image shows overexposure on the feet and shadows cast by other physical body parts.\n\n","date":"April 6, 2015 at 10:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/06/one-that-comes-to-mind-is-a-favorite-photographer-around-here/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"One that comes to mind is a favorite photographer around here"},{"author":"matt_kowalski","post":"Yes you have misunderstood me, but only to the degree that I don’t have the technical language to describe precisely.
