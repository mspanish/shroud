The position of the Church, calling it a “symbol of Christ’s sufferings worthy of veneration” gets them off the hook.  Who can argue with word, “symbol”?  It is a smart position for them to take…not calling it a relic or an icon.

They fail to understand that theology is a continuum of science…it picks up where science leave off. For instance, Hebrews 11:3 says, ” By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.”  That is a big clue: “WHAT IS SEEN WAS NOT MADE OUT OF WHAT WAS VISIBLE.” But if all you are looking for is what is visible, you will totally miss it.  I don’t know where the realm of the spirit is, it is probably parallel to our own physical world. Yet the scripture tells us that the spirit is eternal and the physical world is temporal.  Ironically, the atheists of our day are consumed with what is temporary while denying that which is eternal.  Scripture declares that Jesus is the image of the invisible God (Col 1:15).  He came from the spirit realm, became physical for 33 years and returned to the spirit realm. Did the Shroud capture that split second in time when the physical body of Jesus returned to spirit (light)?\n\n","date":"April 30, 2012 at 12:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/30/paper-chase-new-paper-challenges-rogers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Paper Chase: New Paper Challenges Rogers"},{"author":"shroud_encounter","post":"There are too many references to light in Scripture for it to be ignored.

However the image represents the PROMISE of future glory. So the Shroud reveals both the price paid and the promise of transformation for all who believe. \nHere is the future promise: But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.

The strips were likely strips of linen used to bind the wrists, ankles and head and perhaps strips around the outside of the cloth.  The use of a single linen cloth is mandated in the event of violent death with significant loss of blood.  The other cloth referred to as a “napkin” in John’s gospel is not the usual talit (prayer cloth) but was a cloth used to cover his face from the cross to the tomb.  It was folded up and placed next to the body and was not on the face in final burial.  The spices and oil were brought to the tomb but probably not applied due to the impending Passover sabbath.  The women were on their way to the tomb Sunday morning to finish anointing the body when they encountered the empty tomb.\n\n","date":"April 15, 2012 at 7:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/15/francis-turretin-had-long-hair/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Francis Turretin had long hair"},{"author":"shroud_encounter","post":"Well perhaps “serious scholars” wouldn’t put forth a theory that Jesus was married but popular media…you know the ones that influence culture, movies, junk novels, Discovery Channel “documentaries” and our children…is replete with it.

On one hand no one wants to be described as “anti-science.” Yet I am smart enough to know that science is often agenda driven and heavily influenced by money, politics and the world view of those doing the science. Once something has become dogma in the scientific world, try getting a peer reviewed journal article published that espouses a contrary view. Science can be just as dogmatic as any religion.  While I don’t describe myself as a “young earther”, I also hold great skepticism towards science models that hold to a godless evolutionary view where all can be explained by random chance and natural selection.  Within academia, to even mention Intelligent Design is tantamount to treason and heresy.  Yet the principle of ID is clearly taught in Scripture….”The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament reveals his handiwork.”  God is first and foremost the Creator.  Secular science wants to strip Him of this glory by attributing everything to natural causes.  I don’t buy it.  Until the day I die and meet my maker, no one will convince me a process that by definition is unguided, undirected, with no plan and no purpose can result in a universe and a world characterized by complexity, order and design (“apparent design” for the evolutionist).  I see Intelligent Design all around me but that is because I choose to see it.  Jesus has much to say about the Pharisees of his day who had eyes but could not see.
