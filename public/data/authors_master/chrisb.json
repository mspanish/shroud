As for exhausting naturalistic explanations, I think that in the main they have been. The chances of vapours arranging themselves to form a virtually non distorted image is highly improbable, and this method should be discounted. Scorches, applied substances such as pigments have also been discounted scientifically. There isn’t a great deal left apart from radiation models. I don’t buy secondary miracles as it just doesn’t seem to do justice to God’s majesty, and this comes back to my point about being embarrassed about professing a proper miracle. I believe that Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead without any naturalistic factors being involved, and that he walked on water without the aid of a strong wind for example.
