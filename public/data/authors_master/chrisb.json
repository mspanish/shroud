I think any discussion concerning Shroud and HPM needs proper context addressing. Did the HPM artist see the Shroud or not? This fact could drastically affect your probability weighting. Some aspects of the HPM are more certain than others when comparing to the Shroud. E,g. 1. There are certainly missing thumbs on the HPM and Shroud. 2. It is uncertain whether or not the HPM depicts a tomb lid with a zigzag pattern or whether it is the Shroud with its herringbone weave.

The chances of vapours arranging themselves to form a virtually non distorted image is highly improbable, and this method should be discounted. Scorches, applied substances such as pigments have also been discounted scientifically. There isn’t a great deal left apart from radiation models. I don’t buy secondary miracles as it just doesn’t seem to do justice to God’s majesty, and this comes back to my point about being embarrassed about professing a proper miracle.
