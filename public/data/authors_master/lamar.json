I got kicked out twice the second time for selling drugs .. Always kept in mind my whole life for some odd reason I would use this Jesus /God if I was ever in a bind .. /911. When I was 21 iwas at a party with about 50 people I didn’t know a lot of bad people. Got into a fight at least ten of them. They beat me to the point I said under my breath Jesus please have mercy on me don’t let me die cause they wont have mercy on me. I ended up with 4 stab wounds and 1 was an eighth of an inch from my lung. I’m going on 27 .. Now the fool says in his heart there is no God.","date":"2012-04-14","mins":"3:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"id":"comment-10374","author":"lamar","post":"Adam, you’ve Chosen your paths… Your life is spared… A miracle!!!.","date":"2012-04-14","mins":"3:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
