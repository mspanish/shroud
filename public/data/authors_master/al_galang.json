I tend to veer towards Yannick’s stand that a scientist examining the shroud should possess not a tinge of any bias for or against any religious inclination so the credibility of the test results no doubts are cast. And Guilio’s statements have some of it. It’s more of a claim rather than evidence beyond doubt. The mere fact the shroud is now owned by the Vatican and knowing fully well of its reputation, clouds most or any test associated with the owner. I was raised a Roman Catholic and I prefer to be neutral and “fully scientific” on this one. A joyous Easter to all. : ).","date":"2013-03-29","mins":"12:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/27/giulio-fanti-the-image-of-a-man-who-lived-between-280-bc-and-220-ad/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Giulio Fanti: The Image of a Man Who Lived Between 280 BC and 220 AD"}]}
