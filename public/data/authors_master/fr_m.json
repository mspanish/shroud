{"art":[{"author":"fr_m","post":"Good point, David. Take a look at the CATALOGUE OF THE LATE BYZANTINE COINS 1081 – 1453. There are coins with The Holy Theotokos ( Θεοτοκος ) and Ever-Virgin Mary, Mother of God on the obverse with the emperor on the reverse. What Giulio calls a bubble on the chin seem to be a common feature for Mary. Is Giulio’s coin such a coin? Does he have full coin pictures for us to examine? Also, there seem to be some pictures of Jesus without a beard. An inventory by dynastic period might be useful. http://www.orthodoxcoins.com/books/catalogue-of-late-byzantine-coins-vol1/intro-chap6.pdf","date":"July 31, 2013 at 11:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/31/a-question-from-giulio-fanti-about-a-byzantine-coin/","cat":"art","title":"A Question from Giulio Fanti about a Byzantine Coin"}],"dating":[{"author":"fr_m","post":"I suspect that the Archdiocese of Turin has already secretly dated the material.
