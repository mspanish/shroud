Take a look at the CATALOGUE OF THE LATE BYZANTINE COINS 1081 – 1453. There are coins with The Holy Theotokos ( Θεοτοκος ) and Ever Virgin Mary, Mother of God on the obverse with the emperor on the reverse. What Giulio calls a bubble on the chin seem to be a common feature for Mary. Is Giulio’s coin such a coin? Does he have full coin pictures for us to examine? Also, there seem to be some pictures of Jesus without a beard. An inventory by dynastic period might be useful.
