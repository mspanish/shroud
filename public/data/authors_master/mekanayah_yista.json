{"opinion":[{"author":"mekanayah_yista","post":"Lol, I’m either A or AB- and I look too much like Hey-zeus for comfort… and I’m far too involved in the higher realms. I’m also completely indescribable, like much of the rest of my family. But none of that matters. If you have a divine purpose then live it. For those of you speaking of the shroud, I believe it could certainly have had AB- blood on it. As spiritual as my blood is, and with how we’ve kept our blood pure through genetic predisposition, I believe there’s something pretty special about it. From my experience (and my family’s), we live with a certain intensity, but we suffer the same amount. We can survive through just about anything and yet we worry about the small things… the tiny insignificant things. I feel that’s just a reflection of the state of the world as a whole that’s projected out from our inner-selves. A lot of RH negatives are like that in general, but I feel that the AB- are just totally incompatible with the way this planet has been for such a long time. It’s a living hell. Lol, good day (or night/morning) to anyone who reads this nonsense. :)","date":"June 16, 2013 at 5:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"},{"author":"mekanayah_yista","post":"That’s odd, kinda… I’m pretty much the same, except switch with Cherokee and add in a bit of Scottish. Really odd how the combinations came out to AB- blood. I agree with your views though (guessing those are your views and not just public contemplation for the most part, lol). Ahhh, life is so full of confusion.","date":"July 16, 2013 at 11:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/25/tales-of-blood-type-ab-negative/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Tales of Blood Type AB Negative"}]}
