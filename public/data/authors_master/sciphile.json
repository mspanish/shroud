I would say however, that although these kinds of discussions may seem like “preaching to the choir” for those of us who are involved in science and skepticism, I think that a site that promotes science and skepticism towards the general public is valuable. Keep in mind, most of this is unknown or uninteresting to the laity.\n\n","date":"May 12, 2011 at 11:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/12/kcs-life-based-science-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"KC’s Science-Based Life and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"sciphile","post":"I hope that you will bear with me concerning a response to this post.

Dan Porter, the author of this blog, explicitly states that since there is not conclusive evidence, that “a leap of faith over unanswered questions is essential.” So yes, even though Dan does not have evidence of authenticity either way, he asserts that it is authentic. And I think that this is a non-skeptical assertion from a foundation of Christian belief. This is why I have replied in the manner in which I did on my blog, where I argue for a natural, non-authentic, conclusion. I still would like to know what your (reader and Dan) thoughts would be on the shroud if you were not Christians.\nSecondly, Joe Marino says:\n“So the basis for determining if Dan is a skeptic of the Shroud or not is NOT anything to do with examining the data but K.C.’s educated opinion? Gosh, what a great system!”\nThanks for considering my opinion educated, but the sarcasm is palpable and unneeded. Further, Dan is not a skeptic of the shroud. He said that he once was, and that he since has made a (presumably) faith-based conclusion about its authenticity. This is not my opinion, Dan says so right in the “About the Author” tab. \nAlso, what is all this “data”? From what I have read, and what Dan has stated as well, there is not enough evidence to make a determination either way (and this is why I advocate skepticism). There is no positive, conclusive, “smoking gun”. It is more reasonable then, I think, to remain skeptical, and not make faith-based assumptions. So no, Dan is not a skeptic of the shroud because there is not enough evidence to not be a skeptic, and he has stated that he is not a skeptic outright. This was not my opinion.\n\n","date":"May 17, 2011 at 1:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/17/you-said-that-you-too-were-once-a-skeptic-of-the-shroud-and-i-dont-think-that-i-truly-believe-you/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"You said that you too were once a skeptic of the shroud, and I don’t think that I truly believe you . . ."}]}
