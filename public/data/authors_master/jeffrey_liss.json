They can be generalized as a plea: Pay as much attention to the technology and information model used to identify, preserve, and share scientific data as you do on the methods of collection and analysis.\nThe goal here is to structure information such that it can readily be understood and reused by others.  Much of the web today consists of ‘mashups’ made possible through open APIs.  This enables others to combine and recombine content from multiple sources to deliver new information, adapt existing information to a new purpose, or discover relationships between previously disparate sources.  In other words, it powers everything from serendipitous discovery to cutting edge computer-aided research, but it can only exist when openness and sharing are prioritized rather than grudgingly conceded.  \nAny future investigative project should carefully consider and implement the following:\n1. Transparency.  We live in an age of digital rights management, copyright wars, and efforts to control what can exist and persist on the Internet.  Any future investigation should commit to the release of all images, video, data, analysis, etc. gathered.  In fact, there is no technological impediment to streaming all collection activities to a global audience in real time.  After the fact, data should be similarly public from a single Internet repository.  While I have great respect for scientists, the work they do, and the publishing process, the Shroud belongs to the world.  So should the data.  Wherever possible, authors should request that their published materials be publically available, rather than secreted behind paywalls.  For some publishers, this will be a deviation from preference or procedure; again, the Shroud is different.\n2. Data structure: Wherever possible, identify and structure information according to accepted international standards — not just in terms of file formats, but semantics as well.  For example, the Open Provenance Model (http://openprovenance.org/) provides a framework for explicitly identifying and tracing the nature and sources of scientific data.  BioPortal (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/) is a searchable repository of ontologies for the life sciences.  Semantically-structured data is vital for fruitful communication and collaboration, especially between different communities of interest or scientific specializations.  \n3. Public involvement: While the very thought will rankle some, there needs to be a way for non-professionals to be involved in the preparation, planning, execution, and analysis.  The fact is that important contributions have been made by non-professionals or by scientists working in “home laboratories.”  It is far better to encourage — but also formalize — those contributions than to summarily exclude them.  An example implementation might work something like Reddit.  Allow members of the public to comment or make suggestions, and use a system of weighted comment promotion as a traceable, rigorous way to move information collectively identified as valuable from a comment all the way to the attention of the scientific team.\nOther priorities need to be stressed, but with these three implemented (as well as the existing methods of getting people’s attention such as SHOUTING and comboxes) others will advocate for them more effectively than I.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2013 at 1:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/14/colin-berry-is-writing-to-the-vatican/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry is Writing to the Vatican"},{"author":"jeffrey_liss","post":"Equally incisive is Erwin Schrodinger: “It seems plain and self- evident, yet it needs to be said: the isolated knowledge obtained by a group of specialists in a narrow field has in itself no value whatsoever, but only in its synthesis with all the rest of knowledge and only inasmuch as it really contributes in this synthesis toward answering the demand, “Who are we?”\nIn other words: Nothing means anything except in the context of everything.

I’ll offer up a (completely off-topic) example.\nAmericans with an interest in naval history may recall some of the controversy in the 1990s surrounding the identity of the U.S.S. Constellation, one of the few surviving warships from the age of sail.  It is currently moored at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland.  While everyone agreed the ship existed and that it was old, the question was how old, and which ship was it?\nWas it the U.S.S. Constellation constructed in 1797 — one of the six original frigates of the U.S. Navy and a sister ship of the U.S.S. Constitution, the oldest comissioned warship still afloat?[1]  Was it a separate ship, a sloop-of-war constructed in 1854?[2]  Was it an extensive refit or partial reconstruction, with pieces of the original frigate used to construct the hull of a new vessel?  The U.S. Navy was adamant: there was only one ship named Constellation in the Navy List, and it was never stricken.  Therefore, the ship at Baltimore had to be the original.  Historians were less certain.\nLong story short: an extensive, multi-disciplinary investigation was conducted (sound familiar?), and the team was able to determine the truth: they were two separate ships.[3]  There was never an attempt to deceive, just some sloppy record keeping by the Navy — which also very much wanted to believe it still had not one but *two* of its original 6 frigates.\nI think anyone reading this blog recognizes many of the scenarios or possibilities the team investigated.  They are the same that come up when debating the Shroud or any relic.  The only difference, of course, is that the Constellation finally yielded a clear answer to its true identity — something the Shroud stubbornly refuses to do.\nHistory often works in the exact opposite way from science.  STURP investigated and concluded it could not say what the Shroud image was, only what it was not.  The Shroud’s Edessan sojourn is one of several possibilities, none of which can positively be disproved.  So, I’m going to agree with John Klotz: all this is extremely interesting, but it needs to be approached as backstory.  History, art, even Scripture — none of them can positively rule out authenticity.  The Shroud itself, and therefore the science, is the most compelling evidence.  \n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constellation_(1797)\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constellation_(1854)\n[3] http://www.dt.navy.mil/cnsm/docs/fouled_anchors.pdf\n\n","date":"January 6, 2014 at 12:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/06/yannick-clment-on-the-letters-between-jesus-and-king-abgar/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick Clément on the Letters Between Jesus and King Abgar"}],"image":[{"author":"jeffrey_liss","post":"A useful approach to this question might be to ask not where the nail is but how it got there.  Yes, of course, a Roman soldier hammered it into place, but how does one go about doing that?  More importantly, how does one do it efficiently and repeatedly on one of those days where the glory of Rome demands crucifying hundreds or even thousands of its enemies?  \nLike anyone with experience in law enforcement or the martial arts, I’ve learned, practiced, and employed my share of wrist locks.  It’s worth keeping in mind that the victim’s hand was probably not in the neutral, relaxed position we see in x-rays or diagrams.  Even if this is the Shroud of Christ and he willingly stretched out his hands to receive the nails, most victims of crucifixion would not go so willingly.  So, the Romans would have had techniques for immobilizing the wrist and positioning the hand in the ‘ideal’ posture for their purposes.  The effects of these would be to seriously distort the bones of the hand.  The spaces between bones would have expanded in some areas and lessened in others.  \nI think this merits further study, if only because we know so little about how crucifixions were actually carried out.  Granted, that’s an area of ‘lost knowledge’ that humanity is probably better off without, but it might help to clear up this issue.

There are some very good articles on religious topics — because they are largely left alone by the so-called ‘skeptics.’  But the Shroud matters — for all the obvious reasons.  Don’t get me wrong — I think this is a fight worth having, and there’s no more public venue for it than Wikipedia.  Just be prepared to match them, either with vigilance bordering on obsessive-compulsive disorder or with numbers and discipline; you’ll need a group of people dedicated to watching and influencing the article.\nInitially, they will respond within Wikipedia — by using the system to their advantage.  If you persist, they’ll use social media channels like Twitter and Reddit to rally atheists to the fight.  So, the key is to out-think and above all out-reference them.  I would suggest focused, defensible edits.  Discredit the work of McCrone and Nickell, for example.  Wherever possible, reference only peer-reviewed studies in major journals (the atheist gospels).  Don’t, for example, cite the Górny and Rosikoń book (nothing against it; my pre-ordered copy is on my desk as I type this); instead, cite the actual studies or research on which they relied.\nStep one is to prepare by learning how Wikipedia works.  YouTube is a good source for this.  For example, here’s a two-part video on how to add citations in Wikipedia articles: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2HFdEtYDyc and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_a9fBc13b4\nUltimately, this is winnable because the weight of research, facts, etc. are on the side of (at the very least) the Shroud being completely unique and utterly inexplicable.  Just understand what you’d be getting yourselves into.  I think it’s important, though, precisely because Wikipedia represents the zeitgeist of the Internet (sort of a meta-zeitgeist, I guess).  A truly balanced, NPOV article here will make a lot of people think about the Shroud, the evidence, and what it all means.  But then, in the interests of full disclosure: I pick fights with atheists on Twitter for fun.

After being reverted a few times, I added the following to the Talk page:\nThe final sentence of the introduction identifies the TS as ‘one of the most studied and controversial artifacts in human history.’ My attempt to correct this sentence has been repeatedly reverted. There are two reasons the correction is needed. First, use of the term ‘artifact’ is not NPOV, as the article goes on to state the image — the thing that makes it controversial — was formed by unknown means and is the subject of debate.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘artifact’ as: An object made or modified by human workmanship, as opposed to one formed by natural processes.\nMerriam-Webster is even more definitive:\n1.a : something created by humans usually for a practical purpose; especially : an object remaining from a particular period\n1.b : something characteristic of or resulting from a particular human institution, period, trend, or individual\n2 : a product of artificial character (as in a scientific test) due usually to extraneous (as human) agency\nThis exludes a) natural processes and b) acheiropoieta. Thus, the use of ‘artifact’ represents editorial opinion. This would seem to be confirmed by the revision comment: artifact is correct (this shroud was made by someone), don’t change words in quotations.\nThe words are not part of a quotation; if they are, they are quoted inaccurately. The reference included for this sentence states: According to LLoyd A. Currie, it is “widely accepted” that “the Shroud of Turin is the single, most studied object in human history” in Lloyd A. Currie, “The Remarkable Metrological History of Radiocarbon Dating Journal of the National Institute of Standards and Technology 109, 2004, p. 200.\nCurrie says ‘object,’ not ‘artifact.’\n\n","date":"December 3, 2013 at 4:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/02/the-anti-shroudrelicscatholicchristian-propaganda-on-wikipediaguest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The anti-Shroud/Relics/Catholic/Christian propaganda on Wikipedia–Guest Posting by O. K."},{"author":"jeffrey_liss","post":"Actually, this is something any of us can help with.

You could even set up a recurring, incremental backup that periodically scans the site for updates and downloads just those.\nOn a related note, don’t discount the value of cloud storage — not as a replacement for physical media but a supplement.  Dropbox, box.com, SkyDrive, Google Docs, etc. all allow you to store huge amounts of data for free.  Even the paid accounts which offer storage into the terrabytes are fairly reasonable.  They’re also excellent for files you want to share with others or make publicly available.\nFinally, once a ‘canonical’ backup of the site exists, it would probably be good to set it up for distribution as a torrent, as is explained here: http://www.sidewalkcrusaders.com/bthowto/btstart.html\nNow I’m really getting carried away, so I’ll stop there.
