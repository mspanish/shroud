{"events":[{"author":"yannick1973@hotmail_com","post":"I would rather say David that faith is needed first to really appreciate the Shroud and the message we can get from it (by the way, I like the way you use the word “sign”).  I really doubt that this piece of cloth can really convert a lot of people, especially in our modern materialistic world.  I have sense that the Shroud is there to strengthen the faith of you, me, Russ, Andy, etc., much more than to convert a non believer like my friend Barrie Schwortz!!!\nAnd I also think that Christians would gain a lot by forgetting the idea that they can find some proofs of the Resurrection by studying this cloth, but instead, that they can get a great help to meditate on the extreme LOVE AND MERCY of God for each one of his children, believer or not.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2013 at 4:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/08/pope-benedict-says-shroud-of-turin-authentic-burial-robe-of-jesus-it-doesnt-matter-what-science-says-about-its-authenticity/","cat":"event","title":"Pope Benedict says Shroud of Turin authentic burial robe of Jesus & it doesn’t matter what science says about its authenticity"}]}
