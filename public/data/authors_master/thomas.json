But from what I know they are usually in a symmetrical or at least artistic pattern, not the assymetrical / non-artistic patterns seen on the HPM. And they are usually a lot larger than the tiny holes we see on the HPM. De Wesselow who is an EXPERT in things art historical supports these views (which I would note I have personally held for years).Please explain your objections to this.\n– Please explain why, if the object is a tomb lid, that there are two red lines which look very much like depictions of blood. Note these are next to the central cross-filled area of the object which I interpret as symbolising the body image on the shroud (which if true would have blood to just one side of it, and L shaped holes just to the other side of it, like the Shroud.) I don’t know of any precedence for a blood covered tomb lid.\n– If the cloth on top of the object is the Shroud, then it is very small. The artist is not that gifted, but I’m sure if it was the Shroud he would have made it look closer to full body shroud size. Rather it appears to be the size of a face covering cloth, in which case as per John’s Gospel account we would also expect to see the Shroud. And in fact we do here, because it is the object you think is the tomb lid.

Yes.”\nNo. A figure derived from a supposedly genuine image of Jesus must look a bit like him. Specifically, it must have a full beard and a moustache. If it doesn’t have those fundamental identifying characteristics, it cannot be considered the same man, regardless of the pose or the nudity.\nNo. An artistic representation is always that – a representation. Especially in terms of an “artist” with the obvious limitations of the HPM artist, there will be limits on his ability to represent the shroud.\nAlso it is not at all obvious that the Shroud Man’s beard is full and long. TO me, it is not really a big full bushy beard. Remember too that we have the benefit of digital enhancement, and photo negative, which they obviously didn’t have in the 1100s.    \nB) “May 4 fingers, without thumbs on both hands of Jesus on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.”\nNo. Byzantine pictures often show people with no thumbs, but it was not until I studied David Mo’s selection that I realised how many. A third or so of his images show Jesus, and often others, with no thumbs. If the Pray manuscript may derive from the Shroud, then so may all the other Byzantine people with no thumbs, which is absurd.\nThis is  a good challenge. But I don’t think you can so categorically say “No.”  \nC) “May cropped Jesus legs on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.”\nNo. For a start we don’t even know if the image is cropped, and for a second the fact that both shroud and feet are cropped does not demonstrate any kind of connection between the Shroud and the Pray image. I consider this very far fetched indeed.\nI agree this isn’t the most convincing attribute. But again I don’t think it can necessarily be dismissed. I guess the artist may simply have run out of room and not planned the image properly\nD) “May zigzag patern on HPM represent herringbone weave on TS? Yes.”\nNo. I’ve explained why not, and do not need to go into it further.\nAgain, your categorical dismissal is unjustified.  \nE) “May two red smudges on the rectangle on HPM represent blood belt on TS? Yes.”\nNo. The blood belt on the shroud shows interlacing lines, the Pray lines are alongside each other. It is inconceivable that an artist would represent interlacing lines with parallel ones.\nI disagree with OK that these represent the blood belt. But I DO think they represent blood on the shroud, either in a generic sense, or possibly with reference to the streaks on each of the two arms.\nAbsolutely no compelling alternative explanation has been put forward. \n“I don’t know” is not compelling.\nF) “May the four L shaped circles on the HPM represent poker holes on TS? Yes.”\nNo. They are not on the Shroud but the Tomb.\nAgain, unjustified dismissal. No convincing evidence has been presented arguing what these non-decorative circles could otherwise be.    \nI must say, the extreme views on both sides of this debate are rather frustrating.\n\n","date":"June 26, 2014 at 8:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Ok then let’s imagine.

They need to change to 12th century lenses.\nFirstly, picture what the shroud might have been like in the 1100s, if indeed it did exist then. It didn’t have the burn marks. It quite possibly had the poker holes. It quite possibly had the blood.\nI’ve seen the shroud with my naked eyes. It is far less defined than what we see in photographs. In fact I would call the image somewhat ephemeral, appearing more or less defined depending on the distance from the object.  \nKeep all these things in mind when you form your 12th century image of the Shroud:\nfaint ephemeral image, conspicuous poker holes, no burn marks, conspicuous blood marks. Does the HPM image then start to make more sense?\nAn indisputable FACT is that the “3 Marys” image on the HPM contains PLENTY of symbolism. This is demonstrated at the very least by features such as the head next to Mary’s right arm, and the floating character. This symbolic approach differs from the literal artistry of other images in the HPM. It’s as if the artist is saying: “The resurrection and its representation must be mysterious”. In this light, I see no problem in seeing a cryptic allusion to the shroud in the object we’ve all been debating: faint image represented by central crosses, framed on one side by two wavey red lines representing the blood, and the “L shaped” poker holes on the other side. \nIf the artist was a senior cleric who visited Constantinople, then it’s no leap of faith to think that he might have seen the Shroud, and might then have been deeply impressed by it. It’s not then a big leap to think he might have alluded to it in his picture.\nAnyhow, that’s me on the HPM.\n\n","date":"June 29, 2014 at 5:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"thomas","post":"“The base rectangle conveys no impression of being intended to represent a casket, so much as a kind of slab or stone, perhaps even something like the limestone shelves seen in any of the Jerusalem tombs, by wandering crusaders.”\nIt could possibly represent the red marble stone of unction, that was brought to Constantinople in 1180.

The 16th / 17th century depictions had the sole purpose of portraying the Shroud, often for expositions.\nThe HPM artist was portraying the empty tomb scene. Consistent with the biblical narrative he needed to show the left-behind shroud. He didn’t need or want to show the fully laid out Shroud with all its detail.\nOf course, if he had recently seen the Shroud in Constantinople, and seen its very prominent blood stains and “poker holes” (pre-1500s fire) – he might have had reason to at least reference those, especially if they held some symbolic significance.   \nRefer this link below.

I think it is totally insufficient to just ascribe these as some sort of random decorative features. Neither make sense from that perspective.     \n6. Skeptics claim continuity with artistic tradition but there are several departures from artistic tradition (as mentioned above). A very curious departure is the ‘floating head’ next to the sleeve of one of the women, seemingly connected back to the shroud via a floating letter   / symbol. I really don’t know what this symbolises – I can hazard some guesses. At the very least, it shows a lot of symbolism in the mind of the artist – this artist is not one who simply wishes to convey literal depictions. This is very important when considering potential meaning behind the PM.  \nPoints 1-4 can be argued as co-incidences. I accept that. Points 5 and 6, in my opinion, cannot be so easily dismissed.

I see no fundamental problems with the theory of  this idea…. It goes like this:\n– Shroud is authentic. Image is authentic plus perhaps some of the blood stains\n– At some point in the Shroud’s history, extra blood is added to align with the developing artistic tradition of the crucified and wounded Christ\n\n","date":"October 12, 2015 at 1:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/11/was-jesus-body-washed/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Was Jesus’ Body Washed?"},{"author":"thomas","post":"I agree Sampath.

It is atypical and almost certainly suggests the image was created by contact with an object (Jesus’s body if you are authenticist, or bas relief if not) rather than painted on. \nWhy would an an obvious painting created for ceremony – as Freeman suggests – be then exhibited and venerated? Freeman suggests an association with a miracle as a possibility. I think it far more likely that it was exhibited as Christ’s true burial shroud or at least a representation of it, and its mysterious and unique ghostly image (totally unlike a painting) was part of its attraction. I have previously argued that the image was always faint, referring to a number of depictions from the 1500s that clearly attempt to depict its faint ghostly nature. I also argued that the bolder depictions do not prove that the image was once much bolder, but rather represent a less skilled depiction OR the artist’s desire to show the detail of the image rather than faithfully try to depict its faintness. \nCrowds go to see the ghostly image today so why not crowds in the 1600s. Why does its display and attraction of large crowds imply that the image was much bolder?\nI also struggle to see why a ceremonial prop as Freeman proposes would need to show frontal and dorsal images. Why depart from a tradition of just showing a frontal image? eg. the epitaphios\nAnd the nudity remains a problem. Very rare indeed in depictions of Christ. Even in the 1300s the overwhelming majority of depictions showed Christ with loin cloth.

After all, it’s rather hard to the naked eye to make out any eyes within those eye sockets. \nIt’s also a fallacy to consider that the Mandylion can’t be the Shroud because it didn’t show blood on the face image. There is always the potential for artistic licence, and then a tradition to build upon that artistic licence! And the cultural climate through the 800s, 900s and 1000s was ripe for a depiction that showed a non-blooded face. As we all know, the depictions of Jesus from this period were typically non-bloodied – Christ was glorified and all powerful, not the “suffering servant”!\nSome here who attack the Mandylion / Shroud connection believe that the Pray Manuscript is a representation of the Shroud. Yet the PM displays almost none of the bloodied Christ as we see on the Shroud. \nLook at some of the Shroud depictions. They didn’t always show blood on the face.They didn’t always show the scourge wounds. They often (but not always) showed a loin cloth (when that does not exist on the Shroud). They usually don’t show the “blood belt” . They sometimes do not show the “poker holes”. Does that mean they aren’t depictions of the Shroud? No!!!

One can only speculate.\nHowever, one may reasonably ask why this significant change in art history occurred.\nOf course, there could be several reasons. One might think The Black Death in the mid 1300s might have had something to do with it, but this doesn’t stack up given the artistic changes started occurring circa 1300.  \nPersonally, I think the changes were linked to the epitaphios, which started to appear around circa 1200AD – 1300AD and showed a more bloodied Christ than seen before.\nAnd that the epitaphios was influenced by the Shroud. I doubt the Shroud was in southern Germany in the the late 1200s, although it could have been. \nIt’s worth reminding oneself of the geography of Europe around 1200AD.

Why would that be? I got experimenting, draping cloths over my head. The cloth would seem to fall just as heavily over the forehead as the eyebrows. If the variations in image intensity are due to distance from the cloth, as they seem to be, then this doesn’t make sense, as the cloth is touching both the eyebrows and forehead firmly…. \nOn a typical person’s face eyebrows do not project far out.\nHowever, with a statue or bas relief, it would be natural to expect a slight raising of the eyebrow depiction, for effect.\nIf the shroud was draped over a statue, then, the sculpted eyebrow feature projecting (as opposed to nearly flat on a real person) might explain slight lift away of the Shroud from the forehead. And hence the different image intensity.\n\n","date":"May 26, 2015 at 6:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/17/colin-berry-the-scourge-marks-are-frankly-not-credible/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry:  The Scourge Marks are Frankly Not Credible"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Durante image on shroudscope clearly shows image around brow darker than forehead.

Why show an imaged burial shroud ‘to show Christ had risen’ if there was no tradition of a full body imaged shroud?\n– the Shroud itself is of such length as to be quite a nuisance to ‘hold up’\n– why ‘manufacture’ a front and back image?

(refer my posting above)\nThat is certainly conventional doctrine. But if we put that aside, and permit the possibility of the existence of God, then I can’t see any logical problem with the notion that God may not be all powerful.\nI agree that there is nothing stopping the notion of God not being all-good. In my opinion though, I think it more likely that God is not all powerful but IS all-good. Just a belief, but also based on personal experience where I’ve experienced what I think is divine grace. \nI do believe in a ‘force’ (for want of a better word!) that permeates this world – God – that is the source of beauty, peace and goodness. Maybe this notion of God allows for a God that aspires towards the realisation of all these qualities and more but doesn’t always achieve it (ie. not all powerful).\nI don’t believe in a God who only answers some  prayers. I do believe in prayer though! – but not in the sense of ‘ask for and be granted/not granted’! more of a meditative sense of prayer.\nThis notion is not far removed from that put forward by some Theologians who view God as the ‘Ground of Being’ rather than as an objective interventionalist being. \nI sympathise with the philosophical problems of a God who is all powerful, and am not particularly sympathetic to the standard apologist responses.  \nBut as noted above there are definite alternatives, beyond only atheism.\nSurely doctrines can only ever be one interpretation of what God might be.\n\n","date":"January 7, 2015 at 8:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"thomas","post":"Interesting notion of evil.

This image will naturally vary depending on the muscularity of the individual. In me, the slope of the trapezius is not as steep or as “bulky” as my brother, who is anatomically similar but works out at the gym a lot. To my eye, the image on the shroud is of a man who is not excessively muscular, but has generally quite well developed muscles. Whether such muscle development is consistent with the notions we have of Jesus???? If he did a reasonable amount of physical labour, then maybe its consistent. \n“the shape of them from the front does not match their shape from behind”\nA: This is explained by the tenting that occurred on the frontal image but did not occur on the dorsal image. Also, the trapezius muscle is basically flush with the back, but not with the front of the body.\nAs your images show, there is not symmetry in the trapezius image between left and right sides. On the side where the top of the trapezius image is set slightly “lower”, there appears to be a correspondingly lower setting of the arm and hand on the same side on the frontal image. Maybe coincidence. Maybe not. I favour the view that it is not coincidence.\nA further comment :I’ve just noticed on Shroud scope the lack of scourge marks just below the neck on the dorsal image.

I’m yet to hear any convincing skeptical theories, however. Colin B has done some interesting experiments but has not (at least yet) come up with a bulletproof theory.\nI’ve done a lot of thinking over the last couple of years of alternate theories. About 2-3 years ago I thought of a genius alchemist working with substances and bas relief / statue. I also thought of the Shroud also being linked somehow to a flagellant in the mid 1300s eg. maybe the shroud was used to temporarily cover a dead flagellant. But that still raises the question of how the image may have been formed, if it did cover a dead body (whether medieval or from the time of Christ). I’m far from convinced as to the Maillard theory.     \nThere’s plenty I don’t know and am happy to admit it. But I am very confident the image was created by an imprint. I don’t subscribe at all to any notion that the image was painted, such as advanced by Charles Freeman.Because the qualities of the image are certainly related to body / cloth distance.  \nI don’t cling religiously to faith in The Shroud  – it helps support my faith, but I’m very confident my faith would not fall apart if the Shroud was convincingly  shown to be a medieval creation.\nAs it stands, I think at present the collective evidence across disciplines -notwithstanding the carbon dating – points to a date significantly earlier than the 1300s.\nI could still be convinced by a medieval imprint theory, but I’m waiting…\nIn the meantime – and yes it’s unscientific – I believe the image was created by the miracle of the resurrection (and this explains the late carbon dating date).
