But from what I know they are usually in a symmetrical or at least artistic pattern, not the assymetrical / non artistic patterns seen on the HPM. And they are usually a lot larger than the tiny holes we see on the HPM. De Wesselow who is an EXPERT in things art historical supports these views (which I would note I have personally held for years).Please explain your objections to this. – Please explain why, if the object is a tomb lid, that there are two red lines which look very much like depictions of blood. Note these are next to the central cross filled area of the object which I interpret as symbolising the body image on the shroud (which if true would have blood to just one side of it, and L shaped holes just to the other side of it, like the Shroud.) I don’t know of any precedence for a blood covered tomb lid. – If the cloth on top of the object is the Shroud, then it is very small. The artist is not that gifted, but I’m sure if it was the Shroud he would have made it look closer to full body shroud size. Rather it appears to be the size of a face covering cloth, in which case as per John’s Gospel account we would also expect to see the Shroud. And in fact we do here, because it is the object you think is the tomb lid. And the notion that the cloth is the head cloth is also suggested by the floating image of Christ’s head nearby.

A) “May naked Jesus on the HPM be be derived from TS? Yes.” No. A figure derived from a supposedly genuine image of Jesus must look a bit like him. Specifically, it must have a full beard and a moustache. If it doesn’t have those fundamental identifying characteristics, it cannot be considered the same man, regardless of the pose or the nudity. No. An artistic representation is always that – a representation. Especially in terms of an “artist” with the obvious limitations of the HPM artist, there will be limits on his ability to represent the shroud. Also it is not at all obvious that the Shroud Man’s beard is full and long. TO me, it is not really a big full bushy beard. Remember too that we have the benefit of digital enhancement, and photo negative, which they obviously didn’t have in the 1100s. B) “May 4 fingers, without thumbs on both hands of Jesus on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.” No. Byzantine pictures often show people with no thumbs, but it was not until I studied David Mo’s selection that I realised how many. A third or so of his images show Jesus, and often others, with no thumbs. If the Pray manuscript may derive from the Shroud, then so may all the other Byzantine people with no thumbs, which is absurd. This is a good challenge. But I don’t think you can so categorically say “No.” C) “May cropped Jesus legs on the HPM be derived from TS? Yes.” No. For a start we don’t even know if the image is cropped, and for a second the fact that both shroud and feet are cropped does not demonstrate any kind of connection between the Shroud and the Pray image. I consider this very far fetched indeed. I agree this isn’t the most convincing attribute. But again I don’t think it can necessarily be dismissed. I guess the artist may simply have run out of room and not planned the image properly D) “May zigzag patern on HPM represent herringbone weave on TS? Yes.” No. I’ve explained why not, and do not need to go into it further. Again, your categorical dismissal is unjustified. E) “May two red smudges on the rectangle on HPM represent blood belt on TS? Yes.” No. The blood belt on the shroud shows interlacing lines, the Pray lines are alongside each other. It is inconceivable that an artist would represent interlacing lines with parallel ones. I disagree with OK that these represent the blood belt. But I DO think they represent blood on the shroud, either in a generic sense, or possibly with reference to the streaks on each of the two arms. Absolutely no compelling alternative explanation has been put forward. “I don’t know” is not compelling. F) “May the four L shaped circles on the HPM represent poker holes on TS? Yes.” No. They are not on the Shroud but the Tomb. Again, unjustified dismissal. No convincing evidence has been presented arguing what these non decorative circles could otherwise be. I must say, the extreme views on both sides of this debate are rather frustrating..","date":"2014-06-26","mins":"8:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-133028","author":"thomas","post":"Ok then let’s imagine.

Pre 1500s burns the poker holes are conspicuous, indeed the most obvious feature on the shroud. The blood strikes a chord particularly the two prominent streaks on the arms.

I believe skeptics are looking at the Shroud and the HPM with 21st century lenses. They need to change to 12th century lenses. Firstly, picture what the shroud might have been like in the 1100s, if indeed it did exist then. It didn’t have the burn marks. It quite possibly had the poker holes. It quite possibly had the blood. I’ve seen the shroud with my naked eyes. It is far less defined than what we see in photographs. In fact I would call the image somewhat ephemeral, appearing more or less defined depending on the distance from the object. Keep all these things in mind when you form your 12th century image of the Shroud: faint ephemeral image, conspicuous poker holes, no burn marks, conspicuous blood marks. Does the HPM image then start to make more sense? An indisputable FACT is that the “3 Marys” image on the HPM contains PLENTY of symbolism. This is demonstrated at the very least by features such as the head next to Mary’s right arm, and the floating character. This symbolic approach differs from the literal artistry of other images in the HPM. It’s as if the artist is saying: “The resurrection and its representation must be mysterious”. In this light, I see no problem in seeing a cryptic allusion to the shroud in the object we’ve all been debating: faint image represented by central crosses, framed on one side by two wavey red lines representing the blood, and the “L shaped” poker holes on the other side. If the artist was a senior cleric who visited Constantinople, then it’s no leap of faith to think that he might have seen the Shroud, and might then have been deeply impressed by it. It’s not then a big leap to think he might have alluded to it in his picture.

I also don’t agree with Dave B’s comments on it’s so called wavy edges – I think the artist has tried to portray a straight edge but has got it slightly wonky.

Surely you can agree there IS some discontinuity…I’ve seen no evidence of non decorative and discrete red streaks, isolated / discrete circles in L shaped patters, floating greek letters, and floating heads…but if you can show me then like always I can reconsider, being one not fixated on dogmatic and inflexible perspectives..","date":"2014-07-01","mins":"4:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"id":"comment-134779","author":"thomas","post":"‘Defects’?

The 16th / 17th century depictions had the sole purpose of portraying the Shroud, often for expositions. The HPM artist was portraying the empty tomb scene. Consistent with the biblical narrative he needed to show the left behind shroud. He didn’t need or want to show the fully laid out Shroud with all its detail. Of course, if he had recently seen the Shroud in Constantinople, and seen its very prominent blood stains and “poker holes” (pre 1500s fire) – he might have had reason to at least reference those, especially if they held some symbolic significance. Refer this link below. Note how the poker holes seem to hold less significance as time moved on.

Some of these are seldom discussed: 1. Just look at the top image. I really think it is so representative of the image of Christ that we see on the Shroud. Naked, positioning of limbs etc. 2. Red mark above the eye? Really just a coincidental mark? 3. Shapely, almost feminine thighs? Another coincidental similarity? 4. High chest 5. Along with the asymmetrical 4 circles / holes, skeptics need to explain the two red streaks on the lower image. I think it is totally insufficient to just ascribe these as some sort of random decorative features. Neither make sense from that perspective. 6. Skeptics claim continuity with artistic tradition but there are several departures from artistic tradition (as mentioned above). A very curious departure is the ‘floating head’ next to the sleeve of one of the women, seemingly connected back to the shroud via a floating letter / symbol. I really don’t know what this symbolises – I can hazard some guesses. At the very least, it shows a lot of symbolism in the mind of the artist – this artist is not one who simply wishes to convey literal depictions. This is very important when considering potential meaning behind the PM. Points 1 4 can be argued as co incidences. I accept that. Points 5 and 6, in my opinion, cannot be so easily dismissed.

It is atypical and almost certainly suggests the image was created by contact with an object (Jesus’s body if you are authenticist, or bas relief if not) rather than painted on. Why would an an obvious painting created for ceremony – as Freeman suggests – be then exhibited and venerated? Freeman suggests an association with a miracle as a possibility. I think it far more likely that it was exhibited as Christ’s true burial shroud or at least a representation of it, and its mysterious and unique ghostly image (totally unlike a painting) was part of its attraction. I have previously argued that the image was always faint, referring to a number of depictions from the 1500s that clearly attempt to depict its faint ghostly nature. I also argued that the bolder depictions do not prove that the image was once much bolder, but rather represent a less skilled depiction OR the artist’s desire to show the detail of the image rather than faithfully try to depict its faintness. Crowds go to see the ghostly image today so why not crowds in the 1600s. Why does its display and attraction of large crowds imply that the image was much bolder? I also struggle to see why a ceremonial prop as Freeman proposes would need to show frontal and dorsal images. Why depart from a tradition of just showing a frontal image? eg. The epitaphios And the nudity remains a problem. Very rare indeed in depictions of Christ. Even in the 1300s the overwhelming majority of depictions showed Christ with loin cloth. I know of one or two small paintings, but am unaware of statues or large artistic representations used for public display / worship that show Christ without loincloth.

After all, it’s rather hard to the naked eye to make out any eyes within those eye sockets. It’s also a fallacy to consider that the Mandylion can’t be the Shroud because it didn’t show blood on the face image. There is always the potential for artistic licence, and then a tradition to build upon that artistic licence! And the cultural climate through the 800s, 900s and 1000s was ripe for a depiction that showed a non blooded face. As we all know, the depictions of Jesus from this period were typically non bloodied – Christ was glorified and all powerful, not the “suffering servant”! Some here who attack the Mandylion / Shroud connection believe that the Pray Manuscript is a representation of the Shroud. Yet the PM displays almost none of the bloodied Christ as we see on the Shroud. Look at some of the Shroud depictions. They didn’t always show blood on the face.They didn’t always show the scourge wounds. They often (but not always) showed a loin cloth (when that does not exist on the Shroud). They usually don’t show the “blood belt”. They sometimes do not show the “poker holes”. Does that mean they aren’t depictions of the Shroud? No!!!

An alternative options is the image was created by bas relief and the marks were stamped on. This would be consistent with a 14th century iconography. Q. How do you explain the fact that the ‘bloodstains’ on the Shroud have an almost identical pattern to the Holkham Bible of 1330. A. Really? They are generically similar but this means very little. Q.

There is just not a shred of evidence for this.” Correct – there is no evidence. One can only speculate. However, one may reasonably ask why this significant change in art history occurred. Of course, there could be several reasons. One might think The Black Death in the mid 1300s might have had something to do with it, but this doesn’t stack up given the artistic changes started occurring circa 1300. Personally, I think the changes were linked to the epitaphios, which started to appear around circa 1200 AD – 1300 AD and showed a more bloodied Christ than seen before. And that the epitaphios was influenced by the Shroud. I doubt the Shroud was in southern Germany in the the late 1200s, although it could have been. It’s worth reminding oneself of the geography of Europe around 1200 AD. I found the very good map below. It shows how close Hungary was to the Byzantine Empire.

I’m not going to debate that matter any further. For me, it’s in the dust bin. As you also know, I am an authenticist – on the balance of historical and scientific evidence. However I acknowledge that the matter is not clear cut either way! And to that extent, I think you are definitely barking up the right tree in terms of a medieval creation theory, far more than any other present researcher. However, I still have a number of problems, including but not limited to: – If the Veil of Veronica was the defining influence, why create a whole body front and back image? I’m struggling with this one. The artisan could have just done a bas relief scorch of the face. The legend is unequivocal in terms of the image being one of the face rather than whole body – I know you are deferring from coming up with precise technological explanations for the image, but this is still a hole for me!!! – I know you and some others don’t have a problem with the nudity, I still do!!!! If the image was created for the express purpose of public display / worship, then it defies the norms of the time for no loin cloth! I realise there is the odd image here or there (maybe less than 5% of total images?) that shows a nude Christ, however as far as I am aware they were discrete, small images used in a private worship or ecclesiastical context, not images for wide public display or use!!! And never buttocks on full display (Even the nude images manage to subtly hide genitalia and / or buttocks). I stand to be corrected. Was the artisan and his supporters so sophisticated to promote the Shroud along the lines of: ‘We all know the loin cloth is a nonsense, and that Christ was wrapped in a shroud without also wearing a loin cloth!!” Assuming the apparent skill of the artisan in creating a bas relief or statue, then surely it would have not been difficult to craft a sculptural loin cloth? Fundamentally though, I don’t object to a contact imprint theory. Indeed, it has parallels with the “authenticity” position!.","date":"2014-11-08","mins":"5:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/colin-berry-wants-feedback/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Wants Feedback"},{"id":"comment-169940","author":"thomas","post":"The glorious Queenstown, New Zealand..","date":"2014-11-08","mins":"5:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/08/colin-berry-wants-feedback/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Colin Berry Wants Feedback"},{"id":"comment-170273","author":"thomas","post":"Agreed…much more patient than me!

I seemed to observe that the image of the eyebrows appears stronger than the image of the forehead. This made me curious. Why would that be? I got experimenting, draping cloths over my head. The cloth would seem to fall just as heavily over the forehead as the eyebrows. If the variations in image intensity are due to distance from the cloth, as they seem to be, then this doesn’t make sense, as the cloth is touching both the eyebrows and forehead firmly…. On a typical person’s face eyebrows do not project far out. However, with a statue or bas relief, it would be natural to expect a slight raising of the eyebrow depiction, for effect. If the shroud was draped over a statue, then, the sculpted eyebrow feature projecting (as opposed to nearly flat on a real person) might explain slight lift away of the Shroud from the forehead.

Entombments and lamentations were pictured in both wall painting and in other media, most commonly on the embroidered epitaphios, a textile used during the Divine Liturgy.

So where do I start? ‘The Quem Queritis ceremony…required a burial cloth to be held up to show Christ had risen’ Problems: – the Shroud image is not one of a glorified risen Christ – people such as yourself argue that the silence of history in describing an imaged shroud is a problem for the authenticist’s case. But then you argue for an imaged (front and back for good measure) shroud to be held up in a ceremony as opposed to say a non imaged but bloodied shroud. I think this is logically inconsistent. Why show an imaged burial shroud ‘to show Christ had risen’ if there was no tradition of a full body imaged shroud? – the Shroud itself is of such length as to be quite a nuisance to ‘hold up’ – why ‘manufacture’ a front and back image? A frontal image would have been enough and a lot easier to manage. Your theory suggests a purely ceremonial origin for the shroud but the ultra realistic front and back image flies in the face of this. – the nude image goes against the art history grain….yes yes there were one or two rare exceptions but they were discrete images not things for widespread public display. And sorry I don’t buy your argument at all that there was originally a loin cloth on the image that wore off. – I just don’t buy your argument that the image is the product of a faded painted image. For many reasons. A painted shroud makes sense for an Quem Queritis object, a novel and as of yet inadequately explained image does not (when a painted image would be all that was required for an abstract and symbolic ceremonial use).","date":"2015-12-22","mins":"4:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"id":"comment-203325","author":"thomas","post":"John, according to the Wikipedia entry on Charles he is not an “art historian”.

The incredible difficulty that skeptics and non skeptics alike have today in explaining a “fake it and flog it” theory really does seem problematic. Not necessarily fatal, but close to. I still maintain there are a lot of other difficulties too. I maintain the lack of loin cloth is still an issue if this was an artistic creation. Yes I know I know there is the odd nude Christ in the 1300s / 1400s. But it’s pretty rare statistically. And as far as I can recall where it does occur it’s in pretty discrete artistic circumstances (as opposed to a possible creation with full and frequent public viewing in mind) To what extent, too, would a medieval faker go to the sort of ultra realistic lengths we see on the Shroud? No loin cloth? Blood trickles / smudges OFF the soles of the feet? Side wound that is neither a tidy little slit or an incredibly runny stream down the abdomen (these were the two artistic conventions of the time) Trickles of blood across the lower back that have absolutely no historic artistic precedent… It’s the cumulative difficulty of all these different factors, amongst others, that means the medieval faker theory seems to me problematic.","date":"2015-07-14","mins":"11:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/13/beg-your-pardon-comment-promoted/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Beg Your Pardon (Comment Promoted)"},{"id":"comment-205540","author":"thomas","post":"If we are to consider the Shroud as an ingenious medieval creation, then we should also consider the historical context, which may explain its creation (but also does not dismiss the notion that the Shroud was authentic and “brought out of the cupboard”). That is, France was a shambles in the mid 14th century. It was poor, heavily diseased, and defeated. Display of the Shroud might have served 2 purposes – lifting spirits, and earning money. It’s display may well have been cynically opportunistic, too ie. The masses are suffering big time, they need hope, what better hope than seeing Christ’s real burial shroud (with image and blood wounds to boot), and by the way we’ll get a few coins from every visitor. Then, if it was a mid 14th century creation, within that historical context would its faint image “make sense”? As Hugh states, a stronger image would have given more hope in a hellish time. Yet, a faint image with wounds could allow the masses to better empathise with Christ’s sufferings.Remember the Black Death had been rampant killing millions in France alone.Also, note the German art of the time showed Christ heavily wounded, so there was historic parallel. As Colin says, the Shroud could be seen competitively in this way ” OK you’ve got the veil, but he we’ve got the full burial shroud, with both frontal and dorsal images of Christs, AND with blood wounds” But as I say above, there’s nothing to dispel the idea that an authentic Shroud was opportunistically taken out of the cupboard.

(refer my posting above) That is certainly conventional doctrine. But if we put that aside, and permit the possibility of the existence of God, then I can’t see any logical problem with the notion that God may not be all powerful. I agree that there is nothing stopping the notion of God not being all good. In my opinion though, I think it more likely that God is not all powerful but IS all good. Just a belief, but also based on personal experience where I’ve experienced what I think is divine grace. I do believe in a ‘force’ (for want of a better word!) that permeates this world – God – that is the source of beauty, peace and goodness. Maybe this notion of God allows for a God that aspires towards the realisation of all these qualities and more but doesn’t always achieve it (ie. Not all powerful). I don’t believe in a God who only answers some prayers. I do believe in prayer though! – but not in the sense of ‘ask for and be granted/not granted’! more of a meditative sense of prayer. This notion is not far removed from that put forward by some Theologians who view God as the ‘Ground of Being’ rather than as an objective interventionalist being. I sympathise with the philosophical problems of a God who is all powerful, and am not particularly sympathetic to the standard apologist responses.

This image will naturally vary depending on the muscularity of the individual. In me, the slope of the trapezius is not as steep or as “bulky” as my brother, who is anatomically similar but works out at the gym a lot. To my eye, the image on the shroud is of a man who is not excessively muscular, but has generally quite well developed muscles. Whether such muscle development is consistent with the notions we have of Jesus???? If he did a reasonable amount of physical labour, then maybe its consistent. “the shape of them from the front does not match their shape from behind” A: This is explained by the tenting that occurred on the frontal image but did not occur on the dorsal image. Also, the trapezius muscle is basically flush with the back, but not with the front of the body. As your images show, there is not symmetry in the trapezius image between left and right sides. On the side where the top of the trapezius image is set slightly “lower”, there appears to be a correspondingly lower setting of the arm and hand on the same side on the frontal image. Maybe coincidence. Maybe not. I favour the view that it is not coincidence. A further comment :I’ve just noticed on Shroud scope the lack of scourge marks just below the neck on the dorsal image.

I’m yet to hear any convincing skeptical theories, however. Colin B has done some interesting experiments but has not (at least yet) come up with a bulletproof theory. I’ve done a lot of thinking over the last couple of years of alternate theories. About 2 3 years ago I thought of a genius alchemist working with substances and bas relief / statue. I also thought of the Shroud also being linked somehow to a flagellant in the mid 1300s eg. Maybe the shroud was used to temporarily cover a dead flagellant. But that still raises the question of how the image may have been formed, if it did cover a dead body (whether medieval or from the time of Christ). I’m far from convinced as to the Maillard theory. There’s plenty I don’t know and am happy to admit it. But I am very confident the image was created by an imprint. I don’t subscribe at all to any notion that the image was painted, such as advanced by Charles Freeman.Because the qualities of the image are certainly related to body / cloth distance. I don’t cling religiously to faith in The Shroud – it helps support my faith, but I’m very confident my faith would not fall apart if the Shroud was convincingly shown to be a medieval creation. As it stands, I think at present the collective evidence across disciplines notwithstanding the carbon dating – points to a date significantly earlier than the 1300s. I could still be convinced by a medieval imprint theory, but I’m waiting… In the meantime – and yes it’s unscientific – I believe the image was created by the miracle of the resurrection (and this explains the late carbon dating date). I don’t advance any radioactive theories etc. The resurrection being a miracle defies scientific understanding, so logically if the Shroud image was created by the resurrection then the image making process defies human explanation.

Otherwise you are like a lost sheep.” I don’t agree, I think it is quite obvious that the Gospels are a mix of fact and fable, or literal description and figurative / metaphorical text. There is a lot of research to back that up, and it would seem that generally speaking it is Christians of a fundamentalist nature who would believe every miracle story in the Gospels is literally true. There are some who quite convincingly argue that the Virgin Birth is myth. I’m agnostic on the Virgin Birth. I think it could be myth, or literally true – or both. Because I believe in the resurrection, as a supernatural event, I believe it is logically consistent to consider that another miracle at the START of Christ’s life COULD have occurred. I think it’s a logical fallacy when Christians who believe in the resurrection (unless they believe it in some ‘metaphorical’ sense) say they cannot believe in the Virgin Birth because of its supernatural nature. Having said that the Virgin Birth stories have a lot of mythic qualities. But that doesn’t mean the whole story is myth – maybe it really did occur but was embellished within a mythic framework. I think the resurrection stories are similar, especially Matthew’s account which seems to be embellished with legendary elements..","date":"2015-11-11","mins":"4:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/the-process-of-resurrection/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"The Process of Resurrection"},{"id":"comment-94103","author":"thomas","post":"This is nonsense.","date":"2014-03-28","mins":"2:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/27/mark-antonacci-on-local-st-louis-television/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Mark Antonacci on local St. Louis Television"},{"id":"comment-206999","author":"thomas","post":"David Mo – the question is not necessarily whether or not medieval artists depicted Jesus with crossed hands and thumbs hidden.

Maybe because this was not seen to hold spiritual significance, like the “classic” Jesus wounds. Some show the “poker holes”, others do not. Interestingly, earlier (pre fire) depictions seem more likely to represent the poker holes. Quite possibly this is due to the fact that they would have been a most conspicuous feature prior to the fire.

Far more likely that the loin cloth was just added in to the artistic impressions of the Shroud. I think its also a huge assumption to say that because the artistic impressions show the image boldy that this means that the real Shroud image was much bolder. It may have been bolder, but “that much” bolder? Far more likely, again ,that the images are that bold because the artists wanted to clearly demonstate the image.

My point was that the Lier image – made in the early 1500s – is clearly suggestive of an artist trying to represent the faint image that we still see today. Do you disagree? If so why? I think its pretty clear that the Lier image is trying to represent the faint Shroud image, with its various accents. Therefore the much bolder images of latter dates are not bold because the Shroud image was once much bolder and clearer. Rather, they simply indicate a lack of skill or interest on behalf of the artists in trying to represent the faint image. Ie.

Yes. But… My point was perhaps there is a whole lot of fable built into the gospel stories.

Of course if one can believe in visions or apparitions then it’s not a big jump to a more corporeal resurrected body (albeit not resuscitated corpse). The resurrection stories seem to get more “physical” as they get chronologically later and to me there seems to be a developing tradition that represents increasing “mythologizing”. We can go back to Paul and his descriptions of the resurrection are really quite ethereal. Ultimately, although really interesting, it’s all somewhat speculative, and I personally don’t think whether one believes in a more ethereal resurrection versus a more ‘physical’ resurrection is that critical..","date":"2015-07-07","mins":"3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/04/christian-faith-eroded-to-the-very-core/","cat":"article","title":"Christian Faith Eroded to the Very Core?"},{"id":"comment-170148","author":"thomas","post":"Now you are well and truly into bull s****** territory Charles.

They refer to the prominence of the bloodstains. There is no reference to prominent body images. Indeed, one could deduce that the prominence given to the blood marks is quite suggestive of the body images being faint ie. More might have been made of the body images if they WERE prominent. And I repeat, the Clare nuns referred to ‘traces of a face’ – highly suggestive of a faint, but nonetheless visible, face image. Like today. Summary: none of these references suggest in any meaningful way that the body images were prominent in the 1400s / 1500s. In fact they are suggestive of the opposite! Were the blood marks more prominent than now? Quite possibly. One would expect blood marks to fade over time! But even today, any one who views the Shroud with their naked eyes, without digital image enhancement – such as I have done – attest to the visual predominance of the blood marks over the image!!!!.","date":"2014-11-10","mins":"2:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/09/dear-charles-freeman-re-the-famous-arnolfini-portrait-by-van-eyck/","cat":"article","title":"Dear Charles Freeman, re the Famous Arnolfini Portrait by Van Eyck"},{"id":"comment-170300","author":"thomas","post":"No but so what?
