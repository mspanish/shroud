{"history":[{"author":"andrew_mccauley","post":"So are you implying that the image (or the apparent image) on the Shroud is simply a random artefact produced by an as yet unknown natural process?\nBecause this would put you in opposition both to the skeptics who believe the Shroud is a medieval fraud, and the camp who believe that the Shroud is the real burial cloth of Christ.\nPersonally, I don’t think that any consideration of the image here being a case of apophenia can ever really settle anything or guide us to further study. Ultimately the Shroud will likely stand or fall depending on what may or may not be discovered in various laboratories around the world over the course of the next few decades.\n\n","date":"October 14, 2012 at 4:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/10/max-patrick-hamon-replies-to-charles-freeman/","cat":"history","title":"Max Patrick Hamon replies to Charles Freeman"}]}
