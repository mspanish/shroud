{"image":[{"id":"comment-646","author":"tom_m_new_jersey","post":"I saw a more recent documentary on the shroud. It explained that a couple researching the shroud had discovered that fibers from around 1200 A.D. Were woven into the damaged portions of the shroud. Ironically, the tiny piece that the scientists were allowed to cut off of the cloth contained these fibers. As a result, “older” cloth fibers tainted the results of the carbon dating. They then discovered that carbon dating it again would not be possible because of the chemicals used in the storage and preservation of the shroud which had subsequently been employed. So, the carbon dating was wrong! You folks who still hold onto this carbon dating error theory are in denial. Let’s face it, the shroud is astonishing, and they STILL don’t know how the image was formed. Certainly nothing in the 12th century could have produced it. It is the modern day “doubting Thomas” cure all; I was appropriately named. : ).","date":"2009-06-27","mins":"1:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die"},{"id":"comment-647","author":"tom_m_new_jersey","post":"…correcting a typo: I wrote “As a result, “older” cloth fibers tainted the results.” I meant to say that “younger” fibers had tainted the results..","date":"2009-06-27","mins":"1:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/21/nicholas-allens-photograph-theory-just-wont-die/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Nicholas Allen’s Photograph Theory Just Won’t Die"}]}
