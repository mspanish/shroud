The word “Klaretlin” is practically unheard of in German, apart from that sentence by Luther. In very few examples I have found, German authors who refer to that passage, may intend it as a piece of cloth without specifying that it should be transparent. Add to it that Luther was writing in 1545 and had been in Rome many years before in 1510. He was not so much interested in giving a precise description as to discredit the cult of the Veronica. As far as I know, in the course of centuries there have been no statements by first hand witnesses who testify a transparent veil and the words of Luther, whatever they mean, taken alone have little weight. If you like transparent Veronicas, you find several examples in this page from a rich website: http://veronicaroute.com/tag/velo trasparente/ I do not worry about the words of Pfeiffer or Badde or Gaeta.

A question for O.K.: How do you know that the Rome Veronica was transparent? Nobody knows what it looked like. The painters who painted a Veronica (at least those who painted before ca. 1600), as far as we know, had never seen the (supposed) original that was in Rome. They painted out of their fantasy and according to their own style. The one painter who might have had a chance to see the original was Ugo da Carpi who in 1525 painted this Veronica just for the altar (in old St. Peter) where the Veronica itself was kept. Http://veronicaroute.com/1525/04/29/1525 ca/ But there is no proof that Ugo had really seen the original. Possibly he copied the face from a mandylion like portrait that also was in Rome. At any rate his Veronica is not transparent. Ugo was copying from a contemporary drawing by Parmigianino which is shown at the end of the same webpage. He reproduces the drawing faithfully but changes the face of Christ, and rightly so, whether he had seen the original or not, because the style of Parmigianino was not compatible with a Veronica that should have been in Rome since several centuries and therefore had an earlier style.

One has also to consider that the amount of cotton incorporated in a thread during spinning might vary irregularly from thread to thread. Perhaps one thread was spun in a room where also cotton was spun or was anyhow present, while another thread was spun in a room where cotton was absent. Even for spinning within the same room, according to circumstances, two threads (or two segments of the same thread) might contain different amounts of cotton. Therefore it is not sufficient to compare one or a few spots. It is necessary to statistically compare a sufficiently high number of spots.

It is incredible how many mistakes Riggi could make, beginning with his wrong statements in 1988 and 1989. The order of the samples has been reconstructed from the photos. Usually the order (from the left, i.e. From the border of the cloth) is given as: Reserve, Arizona small, Oxford, Zurich, Arizona large. There are no doubts about the last three. I am note sure about the first two because it is possible that Arizona small was cut from the left end of Reserve. It is not possible to decide because there are no clear photos of Arizona small available. The situation for the Arizona subsamples is not clear. Jull and Freer Waters have published the photo a piece that was not used for dating and is still kept in Tucson. This piece is not the small piece that had originally been delivered as a separate piece. It comes from the large piece (the upper part of it). It seems that also the small piece is still kept in Tucson but there is no clear proof. It is surprising thet Arizona did the dating with only two quarters of the available textile. Recently Barrie Schwortz went to Tucson and took photographs but he was told that there was another piece that was kept at the home of Donahue (who was absent at the time). It is to be hoped that Jull or somebody in Tucson will soon publish a clear photo (front and back) of the Donahue subsample. If they do not give a proof that the small piece is still extant, one might suspect that they dated it but had hidden away the result if it was an outlier..","date":"2013-05-02","mins":"6:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/30/special-request-from-hugh-farey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Special Request from Hugh Farey"},{"id":"comment-32666","author":"gian_marco_rinaldi","post":"Hugh, here are some data about the weight of the samples that was needed for radiocarbon dating in 1988, The 1989 Nature paper refers to a 1987 paper by Slota et al (Radiocarbon 29, 303 306) for the preparation of the graphite targets at Arizona. The paper is available here: https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1051/1056 They say: “The graphite powder is collected, weighed, and ca 1 mg (if available) is pressed into a standard target holder for accelerator 14 C analysis. […] Samples as small as 0.3 mg have been successfully analyzed.” The amount of carbon (graphite) in a textile sample should be about 25%. We do not know the amount of textile weight that was lost during pretreatment. It depends on the conditions of the textile and the cleaning method. Let us suppose that (at least) 5 mg of textile are needed for a graphite pellet of 1 mg. The Arizona lab used 8 pellets (four pairs). This would amount to 40 mg of textile. If they used only two subsamples (14.72 mg and 11.83 mg) the total amount was 26.55 mg. Therefore each graphite pellet was well below 1 mg. At the 1986 Turin workshop (according to Gove in his book) the representatives of the laboratories were asked how much (pure) carbon they needed. The AMS labs answered with a figure between 1 and 5 mg. On the other hand, still to day the laboratories request a rather large amount of textile for the samples they receive. For example one laboratory indicates 20 50 mg. Another laboratory indicates 15 mg. Probably the labs prefer to work with abundant material, especially because archaeological samples may often be in bad conditions and suffer a rather large loss during pretreatment. Moreover very small samples may give less precise results..","date":"2013-05-02","mins":"8:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/30/special-request-from-hugh-farey/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Special Request from Hugh Farey"},{"id":"comment-73074","author":"gian_marco_rinaldi","post":"From my reading of the interview, it does not seem to me that Ballestrero said to have been manipulated.

Other images are from minute 11.30. In all these photos, the warp threads run horizontally, as can be deduced from the inclination of the diagonals of the herringbone twill. From these photos it is easy to count the warp and weft threads. From the bar equivalent to 1 mm as shown with the first two photos, we may estimate that the dimensions of the rectangle are about 6 by 8/9 mm. Then it is easy to verify that the numbers of warp and weft threads per centimeter are just those to be expected from the known measurements by Vercelli and others. The values as given by Freer and Jull are completely wrong. Probably they have mistaken the warp for the weft. This is a serious mistake because it is well known that in the Shroud (and also, as a rule, in most ancient textiles) the warp threads are more dense than the weft threads. This is also immediately evident if only one looks at the inclination of the herringbone diagonals, which form an angle of less than 45 degrees with the warp direction.

You quote from another page of the same 1989 edition of the Treccani dictionary, by Giovanni Romano, devoted to the Turinese Della Rovere family of painters. Your page, not mine, seems to be the right one for our quest. As specified at the beginning of the page, there is no relation between the Turinese family and the “Fiamminghino”.from Milan. Therefore the Giovanni Battista from Turin, mentioned in your quote, has nothing to do with the most famous Giovan Battista. At any rate, neither of them has relation with the family of the Pope. As mentioned in your quote, a certain document has been erroneously attributed to the Fiamminghino. Perhaps a similar error has been perpetuated and still now the paintings of the Shroud are sometimes attributed to the wrong Della Rovere. If so, you have happily solved the doubt. But the problem is not so simple because as you quote, the three portraits of the Shroud are attributed to Pietro Francesco, another member of the Turin family. (The word “nre” in the original is clearly a mistake for “tre” = three.) A couple of paragrahs above your quote (beginning with “Già il 1° giugno 1606 il duca Carlo Emanuele I di Savoia”) it is stated that in 1606 the Duke had given to Gerolamo, the eldest Della Rovere, and to his family the privilege of painting the Shroud. During the following years, until the death of Gerolamo in 1638, any number of paintings of the Shroud may have been produced by Gerolamo or his sons. I cannot go further than this.

Speaking in general, I have often found that scientific journals publish sindonology papers that (in my opinion of course) are invalid or even complete nonsense. I wonder why sindonology papers happen to be reviewed by referees who are so Shroud friendly. One possibility is that the authors themselves have suggested the names of the referees (this is not your own case). There are journals which accept suggestions from the authors as to the names of the referees. Apart from this, when an editor receives a paper on the Shroud (a subject about which he knows nothing) it is natural for him to submit the paper to referees who are themselves sindonologists. At any rate, if I read a paper for which I have myself a negative opinion, I do not change my opinion because the paper has passed the peer review or because the authors have academic credentials. Incidentally, you probably know that Giulio Fanti has published a note criticizing another 2014 paper by Fazio et al: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00405000.2014.961265#.V Dglercc TIV.","date":"2014-10-10","mins":"3:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/07/to-revisit-a-stochastic-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"To Revisit a Stochastic Process"},{"id":"comment-160379","author":"gian_marco_rinaldi","post":"Clément: “I’ve learn through Mr. Fazio that one of the referee was Alan Mills,” Allan Mills can scarcely be considered to be an independent judge.

The parameters were: breaking load, an elastic modulus (two methods), a loss factor (two methods).

Approximately, from the diagram one can guess that the five intervals are: 190 AD 810 AD, 340 BC 360 AD, 90 BC 990 AD, 760 BC 300 BC, 220 AD 940 AD. Supposedly the intervals are at the 95% confidence level but this is not explicitly stated. The respective means would be: 500 AD, 10 AD, 450 AD, 530 BC, 580 AD. Thus the means are widely scattered. Averaging these results, Fanti finds a final result at 400 AD +/ 400. He does not describe his method for calculating the average.

Litt wrote: “The images of light microscopy (interference contrast) and by confocal laser scanning microscopy show clearly that waxes are preserved and cover the structure and sculpture of the pollen grains. This is the reason why I cannot make a precise identification of the pollen at the genus level, even less at the species level. However, with a high level of probablility, I can exclude that the pollen I have seen from the sticky tapes belong to Gundelia.” The report by Litt has not been published, except for the short excerpt above as disclosed by Danin, and it would seem that it is kept secret at CSST since 2001.

There is also a three dimensional elaboration that you can see here at the bottom of p. 36: http://www.cmc.milano.it/Archivio/2010/Approfondimenti/100301 Sindone.pdf Baima Bollone can read six letters of the coin insciption: the first three (TIB) and the last three (LIS, where I have written S for the Greek “stigma”). Surely you can see them yourselve. A couple of years ago I assisted to a lecture of Baima Bollone in Lucca, Italy. One of his slides was the latter photo. At the end of the lecture I went near the screen and asked Baima Bollone to show the photo again. I asked him to point to the letters on the screen. He promptly with his finger pointed at three spots in succession and said: lambda, iota, stigma! I have a question for you, Oskar. Baima Bollone saw the three letters LIS on the low right corner of the photo and in clockwise order. Do you think that the letters (if they existed) should be in that position or elsewhere? And are they in clockwise or counter clockwise order? Are they specular or not (I mean those letters that are not themselves symmetric)? These questions are relevant because Baima Bollone has sometimes published such photos in different configurations, for example with right/left or top/bottom inversions (I leave it to you to ascertain the configuration of this particular photo).

The fibre cross section is elliptical. The fibre diameter is between 10 and 50 µm. Using infrared spectroscopy, the fibre cannot be distinguished from silk or other animal fibres, because they have a similar chemical structure. The nitrogen content is much lower than in other animal fibres. Sea silk is extremely flexible, especially when wet. The resistance is low compared with other fibres, even weaker than wool. In wet state the resistance decreases by about 50%. Sea silk fibres are flammable. “…………. The cross section of the byssus fibre is – in contrast to all other natural fibres – significantly elliptical or almond shaped. It shows no structure. The fibre diameter varies within a single fibre. With 10 50 microns it is comparable with other natural fibres, such as mulberry silk or Egyptian linen 11 15 micron, Merino wool 18 25 micron, cotton 12 35 micron, mohair/alpaca 20 40 microns. From ancient times we know linens of a yarn diameter of 50 microns and a diameter of each fibre of 11 microns (Cook & El Gamal 1990).

Fibers have, in the course of time, detached from the back of the Shroud and become trapped inside the cavity between the cloths, but those that have would be either weaker or more damaged than those which remained in the threads. For example they could be fibers that originally came from areas of stitching or burning or soaking in water or any other places that had suffered damage for some reason. “In addition to the fibers that had already become detached in the past, Riggi’s vacuum cleaner could have detached others while it was working, and those fibres, too, would be weaker or more damaged than those which remained. Fanti’s material is thus shown to be unrepresentative in being particularly deteriorated, so it is no wonder that the age he calculated is more apparent than real.” Fanti did not address this point in his reply to me. The situation is not better if one reads the recent article by Fanti and Malfi: http://www.aimetatorino2013.it/cdrom/cdrom pdf fullpaper/001200008502.pdf In section 4.2 they write: “Eight different TS fibers have been recognized as such by the first author among others using a petrographic microscope and a particular technique based on cross polarization. TS fibers in fact present a greater number of transversal defects (kink bands) than other more recent flax fibers and it is therefore relatively easy to detect them.” These “kink bands”, if I understand well, are twists or bends that denote a weak or deteriorated fibre.

This procedure also allows one to rub the pigment more evenly and more easily than when the cloth is resting over a 3 D human body. In particular, the “covered,” partially visible hand is a difficult feature to reproduce by rubbing, possibly because the stiff fabric cannot adequately conform to the sharp relief of this spot.

For the body, at least partially a similar method was used but with the aid of a real human body, not a basrelief, as recently performed by Luigi Garlaschelli. Therefore it is not even necessary to think that a painter or an artist had a role in the work (a basrelif of a face could easily be found already completed). The “blood” could have been added by anybody, even lacking an artist hand. Any stylistical considerations can only be applied to the sculpture of the face that was used for the rubbing, as far as we can now imagine its appearance. For the rest of the body, apart from the face, there is no artistic style. For example, an artist should have put the long hair also on the dorsal image, where we see only what may well be the imprint of a real human head.

Some people think that the thread spun with the spindle was worse (less strong, less regular, coarser). The contrary is true. The wheel spinning was worse and was used only because it was quicker and saved time and money. Indeed in many places rules were emanated that prescribed that the warp threads, which had to be stronger, had to be spun with the spindle. Only the weft threads might be spun with the wheel. It so happens that in the Shroud (according to Flury Lemberg) the weft threads are coarser and less regular than the warp threads. This by itself does not imply that in the Shroud the warp threads were spun with the spindle and the weft threads were spun with the wheel because at any rate it was usual to use better threads for the warp threads.

I copy from p. 59 60: “The seam that connects the 8 cm wide strip to the larger segment is not a simple one. The type of seam construction chosen clearly displays the intention to make the seam disappear on the face of the cloth as mucu as possible. This is another reason to believe that the Shroud was planned and produced by professionals. The sewing has been done from the reverse of the fabric and the stitches have been executed with great care and are barely noticeable on the face of the Shroud (fig. 3a). The seam appears flat on the face (fig. 3b) and raised like a roll on the reverse of the fabric (fig. 3c). Examples of this same kind of seam are again to be found among the textile fragments of Massada [5] (fig. 3a), already mentioned above. To conclude this chapter it can be said that the linen cloth of the Shroud of Turin does not display any weaving or sewing techniques which speak aginst its origin as a high quality product of the textile workers of the first century A.D.” So far Flury Lemberg. Her figures 3abc are photos of details of the Shroud. Her second mention of fig. 3a is to be intended as another figure on the same page with the scheme or drawing of the stitch from the Masada IV volume, fig. 23 p. 171. This article is the translation of the original German text of Flury Lemberg that had appeared in a previous volume of the same journal: Sindon n. 13, June 2000.
