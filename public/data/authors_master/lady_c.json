{"art":[{"author":"lady_c","post":"It is for you to believe or not. The Akiane painting is a resemblance-any painting or image made by a person will never truly be a perfect and completely accurate rendition of Christ. However, there are many images of Christ that are very much alike to one another as well as the image on the Turin shroud. As God said, it is faith and only faith that will lead you to him. Physical proof will not be the purpose of God, he spread the word through Christ, he founded the new covenant, belief and faith is based on one’s own prayers and willingness to open one’s heart to Christ. We must find him, he already has found us. God sent his only begotten son to us in human form so we could relate to him. He also sent him, knowing that he would be the most mistreated and tortured man in the world by human hands, for the potential forgiveness of sin. I have had many strange and eye opening experiences myself, near death in the womb, forced early birth so I wouldn’t die, sick for a month in an incubator. I have experienced God’s grace through many near death moments. I have seen angels, God has chosen for me to go on, I have seen my grandfather after he died, my father communicated with me for years after he died, I have seen myself from above my body and looked down on the worried people around the bed, it is not for us to question God’s will, it is for us to find our way to him and love him without expectations. Read the bible and meditate over the words and messages, pray for guidance and understanding. God will show you the truth if you seek it unselfishly.\nPerhaps there were some issues in the book Heaven can wait, but that shouldn’t matter, what matters is the message the book has as a whole conveyed;. GOD exists, Jesus exists, Angels Exist, HEAVEN exists as well as HELL.Your salvation is within yourself by choosing Christ. The formula for life is the same in every element of this planets and Universe.God created the formula for all life, how it evolved and progressed was also his doing.\nFind a moment to sit and be still, mediate or pray in silence without interruptions-think back and reflect. There may be an answer hidden in your own buried memories or subconscious mind, a memory of an unexpected fulfillment to a need, a recovery, an accident that could have led to paralysis or death that didn’t. You may be surprised. There is not such a thing as “coincidental”. We use that word because we are lacking in deep knowledge and wisdom as humans, despite our education. “GOD works in mysterious ways”, how true, so many coincidences are not coincidences. God works to help us, he sends us help when we need it, we think we do everything on our own. We don’t, anything we have, is because God has chosen to give it to us.Give God credit, Christ came to us with a message, and we are to listen to that message and accept him as our Savior. Those who need proof, unfortunately will never find it in physical proof, the proof is in his word and his promise of eternal life in Heaven for those who have found him. God also warned us that there will be many who will attempt to lead us astray, there will be many who will use his name in vain. The 4 year old Colton did none of this, most children of that age do not embellish nor lie. He spoke the truth, and it is a message. “Wake up people, God exists, Christ exists, Heaven and Hell exists. It is your choice to decide which one of these two eternal places you wish to spend your eternal life in. Life after our physical death is real. Our physical bodies are needed for our soul so that we may learn to grow spiritually for the sake of our souls. Anger and negativity will never help us to grow in our soul. Without the chance for our souls to learn and grow in goodness, we would never have a change to enter Heaven.\nInstead of criticism find reflection!!!\nBy the way, have any of you thought about the idea that during the time of the Crucifixion they tied all men by rope around the feet and hands to the cross? With that in mind, the weight of Christ body would not be held up by the nails alone. In so doing, it is doubtless that the nails were through his hands and feet, not to break bones and not bearing his whole weight alone on the cross. Think about that.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2014 at 12:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/21/heaven-is-for-real-the-akiane-prince-of-peace-the-isa-mosaic-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Heaven is for Real, the Akiane Prince of Peace, the ISA Mosaic and the Shroud of Turin"}]}
