{"opinion":[{"author":"craig","post":"This is pathetic. Dawkins’ bus campaign hasn’t been demonstrably proven to be untrue. In my opinion, that is because it is true, there is no god, but that is beside te point. The point is that on one hand, Dawkins’ campaign is not unproven, and cost a few quid to stick posters on the side of buses in London. On the other hand, this cult spend hundreds of thousands on a worldwide advertisement campaign.\n\n","date":"May 21, 2011 at 9:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/12/richard-dawkins-and-the-end-of-the-world-may-21/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Richard Dawkins and the End of the World May 21"}]}
