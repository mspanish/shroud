But, the shister who created the shroud knew he had to really “sell” the idea of Jesus’ burial shroud to his potential buyers of the “holy relic”. Some sort of animal blood carefully placed would seal the deal. There are two types of tests for blood: preliminary and conclusive. If the Police see a red stain, they often do a preliminary test for blood. It’s quick and simple and only determines if there is protein present in the specimen. If the preliminary test is negative, they won’t bother doing the conclusive test for human blood. I’m still waiting for the name of the conclusive test for human blood that they used; who analyzed the specimen, and at which CLIA certified laboratory it was done. I fear that the shroud team did some sort of preliminary test ( which would test positive for any species of animal blood) and are trying to pass it off as a definitive test. Surely, such a high profile result would be published in a scientific journal.
