Some sort of animal blood carefully placed would seal the deal.\nThere are two types of tests for blood: preliminary and conclusive.\nIf the Police see a red stain, they often do a preliminary test for blood. It’s quick and simple and only determines if there is protein present in the specimen. If the preliminary test is negative,\nthey won’t bother doing the conclusive test for human blood.\nI’m still waiting for the name of the conclusive test for human blood that they used; who analyzed the specimen, and at which CLIA certified laboratory\nit was done. I fear that the shroud team did some\nsort of preliminary test ( which would test positive\nfor any species of animal blood) and are trying to\npass it off as a definitive test. Surely, such a high\nprofile result would be published in a scientific journal. I haven’t seen it yet in the Journal of Pathology.\n\n","date":"May 15, 2010 at 8:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/09/30/inexplicable-3d-optical-illusion-phenomenon/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Inexplicable 3D Optical Illusion Phenomenon"}]}
