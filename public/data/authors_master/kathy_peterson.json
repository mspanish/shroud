{"art":[{"author":"kathy_peterson","post":"I was fortunate enough to have my married granddaughter buy a copy of the children’s version for my great grandson Grady. I read it while babysitting for him and then read the adult version also. I am Catholic and have been all of my life. I never really was exposed to the Bible as much as the Catechism…..this book really gave me a new look at the Bible and brought it more to life for me. I loved reading everything and seeing it through a child’s innocent eyes. Heaven is for Real has been a real heart warming expierience  for me…thank you so much!\n\n","date":"April 17, 2012 at 1:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
