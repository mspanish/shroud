I resolve to amend this omission! Here are Resurrection NOW, Inc. We accept that Christ’ Resurrection from the Dead is a Singular and Unrepeatable Event that happened in history, and exceeds history. For this reason, our post modern world can become, more and more clear – that this Singularity actually happened, and more and more clear, concerning how to enter Our Lord’s Event Horizon – so that we become Singular People – the True Meaning of Ecclesia – the People Called Out – just as St. Augustine says, VOCANS TEMPORALES – FACIENS AETERNOS!.","date":"2012-09-02","mins":"6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/21/i-didnt-make-the-list/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"I didn’t make the list"}],"misc":[{"id":"comment-16008","author":"francis_j_destefano","post":"Dear Brothers and Sisterrs in Jesus of Nazareth, Crucified and Raised from the dead! Hello Dan, and everyone, I really enjoy your blog too… thank you for all that you have done. The missing piece that I see among all of these Shroud Experts – is that the key to the Resurrection of Jesus – is ACCEPTING that God has Risen! – just as our Holy Father Pope Benedict says! Letting Our Risen Saviour TRANSFORM US! – ON HIS TERMS! – BECAUSE HE KNOWS BEST! Our Holy Father speaks about the Resurrection throwing OPEN the dark door of the future, of time, of death – but in my life the RESURRECTION – has thrown open the DARK DOOR – of my own wretched existence – and is creating a SINGULAR NEW LIFE – within! You are welcome to join me in the Singular Encounter that is Resurrection NOW! Charity, Joy, and Peace in Our Risen Saviour!.","date":"2012-09-07","mins":"7:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/04/while-you-were-sleeping-a-million-page-views/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"While you were sleeping: A million page views"}]}
