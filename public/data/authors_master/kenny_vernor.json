{"history":[{"id":"comment-143103","author":"kenny_vernor","post":"In Acts 22:25 the Romans were “stretching” Paul out with things to scourge him. Paul then asked if it was legal to scourge a Roman citizen. (It wasn’t.) Scourging was for non Roman citizens. This was true of crucifixion as well. The exception of this was for Roman soldier deserters. The Jewish lashing was very regulated. They were bound by law to not go over 40 stripes. So they limited it to 39 in case of a miscount. Then 13 was administered to each shoulder and 13 on the buttocks. A rod was used. This is not the scourging of the Romans. It was generally administered by a trained executioner; a lictor. However, Easton states that Pilate did not have lictors in his compliment, so soldiers were used instead. As many as four may be used. It also appears two different type of whips were used. A flagrum with three straps, with each strap having two lead balls at the end. The others whips used by Romans were the ferula and scutica. It appears a scutica was also used for the Man on shroud. This whip is demonstrated in the above paper I cited. It consisted of several rods, around four, attached to one handle. The reason I asked the question is it appears you can eliminate the low post method due to Acts 22:25. Paul was in the same place as Christ about to be scourged by the Romans and they were stretching him out. I am assuming the same procedure was used on Jesus. So how is the Man struck in the chest if He is tied upright to a column or post? Could the marks be from the reed that was used to also beat Christ by the mob? The Bible though, states He was only beaten in the head with the reed, but that does not exclude other places.
