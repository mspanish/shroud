{"misc":[{"author":"brent_rasmussen","post":"@Dan Porter – “Atheism, despite how strenuously some Atheists deny it, is a belief about religion; non-belief to all except those incapable of logic is belief.”\n———-\nUm, okay. Let’s change things around a bit to illustrate the massive absurdity of your statement:\n“Baldness, despite how strenuously some bald people deny it, is a color of hair; baldness – to all except those incapable of logic – is exactly the same as having a hair of a certain color.”\n“Not collecting stamps, despite how strenuously some people who do not collect stamps deny it, is a hobby about stamp collecting; not collecting stamps – to all except those incapable of logic – is exactly the same as collecting stamps.”\n“The absence of belief in the Loch Ness Monster, despite how strenuously some Nessie-deniers deny it, is a belief about a giant, pre-historic water dinosaur; The absence of belief in Nessie – to all except those incapable of logic – is exactly the same thing as belief in Nessie.”\nSo, black is white, there is the same as not-there, one equals zero, and the absence of a belief is the same as the belief itself.\nSeriously? And you wonder why we consider folks like you to be delusional?\n\n","date":"November 23, 2010 at 1:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/11/23/pz-myers-is-a-fundy/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"PZ Myers is a Fundy"}]}
