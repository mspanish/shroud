Still quite commen is Bisphenol A. Bisphenol A is in the news as it looks to be quite similar to a hormon and therfore skin contact is not good for our health. Very similar to a hormon…? In case using lemon juice with a hormon typically found in human body – could this hormon work as a developer? As I said I am not a chemist – but maybe somebody who is a chemist could let us know his opinion… Some amide wax and other chemicals I would suggest could be found in balsam (or even coming from body itself) are used as sensitizer for the thermal paper – reducing the coulour developing temperature. So I am quite curious to see a linen coating with lemon juice, BPA (or BPS) and some amide wax… Finally – my own search… I am looking for an natural source leuco dey – like lemon juice – which changes colour at about 70 to 90°C to a dark balck, grey, silver or brown – so if anybody has some idea….","date":"2017-08-07","mins":"10:36 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/refining-a-model-childrens-invisible-writing-trick-with-lemon-juice-allows-thermal-imprinting-scorching-at-a-much-reduced-temperature/","cat":"medieval_forgery","title":"Refining a model: children’s ‘invisible ink’ trick with lemon juice allows thermal imprinting  (“scorching”) at a much reduced temperature"}]}
