{"history":[{"author":"saleire","post":"Also…they say at Wikipedia of the likeness on the badge: The Brass Effigy is of the son, French Knight Geoffroi de Charny II. It is presented for historical reference only since there are no known images of the father. It is said to be an authentic likeness to the father as well and the son.
