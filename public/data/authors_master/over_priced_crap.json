Display cost $12.99 US, there are no ads so you are paying for the lack of those ads. The print is large and dbl spaced the take up as much page space as possible with no real content. Whom ever wrote the stories was obviously biased and ill informed. There are no mysteries revealed and little to no factual information on any of the content. Shame on National Geo for ripping me off and dumbing me down. Your magizine 100 greatest mysteries revealed should be re named to we suck and we dont care..","date":"2013-11-07","mins":"2:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/28/national-geographics-100-greatest-mysteries-revealed/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"National Geographic’s 100 Greatest Mysteries Revealed"}]}
