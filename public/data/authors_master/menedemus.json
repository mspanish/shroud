This was true for both men and women. So if you are Benedictine monk  in an enclosed order making an illustration of the burial of Christ, you would simply copy the method of burial you have seen around you. (There are lots of examples from cemeteries so we are absolutely secure on this.) You did NOT need to copy it from the Turin shroud because you would have seen actual examples of bodies being wrapped up just like this.They are giving Jesus a typical Christian burial, using examples, of course, from the gospels for the figures who are doing the anointing.\nAnd we must get away from the idea, that seems to be accepted without anybody thinking about it, that the Turin Shroud would have been  thought to be something special. Goodness knows in Constantinople, you have far ,far better relics around- a big fragment of the Cross was the top Constantinople relic, taken out and about in the streets in a grand procession every year,  and second to that was the holy icon of the Virgin Mary painted by Luke which,when taken out on the walls, had saved the city from being captured. Then there is the robe of the Virgin Mary that one of the emperors would put on to give him protection when he went out of the city to negotiate with Byzantium’s enemies.Then there is the Mandylion which is of the living face of Christ so it cannot be the same as a large piece of cloth with the figure of a dead naked Christ (sorry, Mr. Wilson).  There are lots of documents about these and all we have is ONE mention by Robert de Clari of an image on a cloth in the Blachernae Chapel which might or might not be the Turin Shroud.\nIf someone decided to paint a relic from Constantinople ,it would be very strange for them to choose the shroud when there were so many more more famous ones to choose from.\nThey say that there were 3,600 separate relics in Constantinople and the Turin Shroud would be nowhere near the top!  If it had been we would have had MORE documents about it and they surely would have said that it was a double image, not just an image.\n\n","date":"June 18, 2012 at 1:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/13/a-pointless-discussion-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Pointless Discussion of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"author":"menedemus","post":"Thomas de Wesselow was once a reputable art historian.

Thanks for this information and your thoughtful analysis. Please may I say that when there are so many strange postings on this subject and quite a lot of name-calling, that it is good to find someone who is trying to actually work through the issues!\n The question remains, and has been raised by others during these discussions – is why  the Shroud has to be concealed in this way. If, and there is not enough evidence to be sure of this ( I am being cautious again) , Robert de Clari is describing the Turin Shroud in the Chapel at Blachernae in 1203, it shows that there were no inhibitions about  unrolling it so that the full image could be seen. This was the common practice of course, people wanted to see the relic fully exposed. We do have an illustration of the Crown of Thorns in Paris being shown to the crowds from a tower. So why not show the Shroud more clearly?\nOn Stephen Jones’ blog, there was some statement about the authorities in Constantinople not authorising the Shroud to be shown in full but  no Catholic ( and it is assumed that the illustrator of the Pray Codex was a Benedictine monk) would have taken any notice of any such decree from the schismatic Greek Orthodox Church. Look at what happened just a few years later in 1204- the Crusaders just grabbed what relics they could from the Greeks and took them back to Europe. Many said that it was God’s will that they should do so!\nYes, mysteries are fun – so long as one keeps one’s feet on the ground -it is a pity that the surviving sources are so few.\nDo not worry about Max Patrick Heron We have been trying to get him to explain himself more clearly -at present he is adding nothing to any argument but seems to live in some kind of cryptical world of one-liners followed by typo corrections. There is nothing here that can persuade anyone of anything and perhaps if we keep on making the point he will even realise this himself.\nN.B.

This is ,of course,typical of medieval relic cults in general and not a large number when you remember how many pieces of the Cross, thorns from the Crown of Thorns, the six or seven heads of John the Baptist,etc.were around. Europe , especially if you include the Byzantine empire, was a large place, communications were very poor and individual communities would develop their own cults ,often unaware that three or four hundred miles away, another shrine would be claiming to have exactly the same relic as they had. Even if you knew of your rivals ,you would still develop a legend to show why yours was the real one!

Yes, this is a basic issue that you have pinpointed, David. We have lots of  different versions of the same relics ( not just shrouds,of course),  but we simply do not have clear enough descriptions to be able to trace the fate of each and, in the case of the many shrouds.etc which of them might or might not relate to what we now know as the Turin Shroud. Recognising this is an important step forward because all too often even the most obscure reference to an image on a piece of cloth is assumed by enthusiasts to be a reference to the Turin Shroud. This is not good history.\n I share David’s scepticism over the Pray Codex. While the writer of the latest posting on this blog (just posted, 22nd June)) is convinced by the evidence, i am of the the school that you really do need a lot more evidence before making the kind of assertion. As the key feature of the Turin Shroud is the double image, I start from the assumption that unless this is clearly shown in an illustration or directly referred to then I am not buying. As seems to have been established in other discussions here , the  idea only came from Ian Wilson and no one was ever able to produce a peer-reviewed research paper by an art historian which has backed the idea. (Not too late, if anyone knows of one!- de Wesselow adds nothing of importance in The Sign)\nWhat has been surprising is the number of enthusiastic supporters of the ‘Pray Codex shows the Shroud school’ who do not seem to have even the most elementary knowledge of medieval art. David and others have done a great job in opening up the subject and showing that you really do need to know quite a lot about illustrations of this period before you start making the kind of dogmatic statements some people here and on a neighbouring blog have been making.I am on the fringes of this world but know of academics who have spent years of their lives studying these issues -yet here we find all kinds of pseudo-experts telling exactly what we SHOULD be seeing in what is a rather low-quallity illustration of a well-known gospel scene, made by a Catholic Benedictine monk of a possible relic held by schismatic Greek orthodox Christians. Just too far-fetched to stick with me.\nThere are two points I will conclude with. Not necessarily relevant but may be taken up.\n1) Whether the Turin Shroud is 650 or 2000 years old, it is an important artefact, a rare piece of cloth and a rare piece of art because of the difficulties in defining how it might have been made. If it had been a work of art of say 1300 ,the age of Giotto, imagine how it would have been treated for further examination/ conservation. There would have been a long period of examination in controlled conditions before anyone even thought of doing any work on the surface. I don’t need to repeat the sorry story of how the Turin Shroud has been treated  -virtually every basic procedure for dealing with an item of this age and vulnerability has been ignored.  I am sure people thought they were doing the right thing but far too many people who had absolutely no training in the most basic of conservation techniques were let loose on the Shroud, and even allowed to take off substances from it. The chances of every really finding out how it has been made are certainly diminished as a result. The substances detached  from the Shroud are floating around the world, it is not even clear who controls them (at the very least they should all be returned to one conservation laboratory, probably in Italy so that a team of textile experts can work on them in one place).  I have even read of one enthusiast who has managed to get hold of part of the Shroud which he treats as a relic. It is a shocking story of how not to treat medieval ( or earlier) art.\n2) The Protestant reformers had a point ( although I deplore the way they destroyed relics).\nAll too often a relic became more important than Christ and the scriptures. Some pro-Shroud supporters come across as more attached to the piece of cloth than to the man who may, or may not, have been laid in it. Not healthy, and probably idolatry ( see Ten Commandments) rather than Christianity.\n\n","date":"June 22, 2012 at 6:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/13/a-pointless-discussion-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Pointless Discussion of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"author":"menedemus","post":"Davor. I notice that on your link Andrea Lombatti has given the reference to his own article on this issue. It is much more comprehensive than Averil Cameron (who, as one of the finest Byzantine scholars in the world, has better things to be spending her time on) and deals with all the points, refuting Ian Wilson and his supporters in particular.\n I think you overestimate the amount of support Wilson has – do any of these ‘scholars’ hold an academic position in Byzantine/medieval history or literature? I think you will find not. \nLombatti’s article needs to be in English. I hope it will be translated soon.  Anyone relying on the 944 sermon by Gregarius ( a typical welcoming of a relic to a new home sermon) needs to quote from the early part of the sermon where Gregarius makes it clear that not only is he looking at a cloth with just a face on it  (of Christ, of course) but that this cloth was given by Jesus, after he had wiped his face with it ,in the garden of Gethsemene  to the apostle Thomas who then handed it to Thaddeus who then, of course, keeps it and brings it to Edessa. So, as far as Gregarious is concerned, the cloth by-passed the tomb altogether. This is the clinching point.\n The sweat of Jesus is thick ‘like blood’ – i.e. it is not actually blood  and the point Gregarius is making about the wound in the side, although rather theologically obscure is that the water of the sweat is similar to the prestigious water that flowed, on a later occasion at the Crucifixion, from Jesus’ side alongside blood. It is for that reason that  the Image is to be honoured.\nIn fact, the first part of Gregarius’ sermon is one of the best pieces of evidence we have that the Image of Edessa/Mandylion that Gregarius was welcoming to Constantinople was not a burial shroud. \nHere is the relevant passage. Gregarius is telling his congregation  the story of the Image of Edessa by narrating the events by which it came to Edessa. Thaddeus has arrived with the Image in Edessa and the story goes on:\n‘And Thaddaios answered [to king Abgar], “When Ananias [ the messenger of Abgar], who you entrusted the letters to, said in hope that apart from your health, you also wished to look upon the likeness of his [Christ’s] face as it was seen, Jesus told him to come quickly to you with the letter, in which he promised to send you one of his disciples after his ascension, and I [Thaddeus] am that disciple. But Jesus, undergoing the passion of his own free will, believing that human nature fears death – indeed death comes upon the very nature that was made to live – taking this linen cloth [i.e. the Image of Edessa that Thaddeus is holding] he wiped the sweat that was falling down his face like drops of blood [note ‘like drops of blood’, not actual blood!]  in his agony. And miraculously, just as he made everything from nothing in his divine strength, he imprinted the reflection of his form on the linen.\nWhen he came down the mountain after praying, he gave it [ the cloth] to Thomas, one of my fellow disciples, as I was not there. He [Christ] told him to give it to me [Thaddeus], so that after the ascension I could bring it to you.’\nAnd anyone who still thinks that Gregarius is talking about a burial shroud needs some serious help. There is, of course, as you will find when you read Lombatti’s article, a mass of other evidence making it clear that the Image of Edessa is not a burial shroud.\nThere is also an article by Charles Freeman- found online ‘Charles Freeman Shroud of Turin’- that shows how tetradiplon refers to the method by which the Image of Edessa was folded for storage in such a way that the face of Christ was not folded.\n\n","date":"June 22, 2012 at 9:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/13/a-pointless-discussion-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Pointless Discussion of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"author":"menedemus","post":"Are you saying that the Santa Pudenziana Mosaic is showing the Turin Shroud?

He says  that a cloth of 4 by 4 would be reduced to one of 2 by 2 with the face still exposed  at the centre. So the Image of Edessa could be stored in a box and then viewed when the box was opened without having to unpack it.\nSo you wouldn’t need Wilson’s elaborate theory about folding up the Turin Shroud.\n I haven’t seen anyone comment on Freeman’s argument so far but as Davor clearly has done a lot of work on tetradiplon his comments would be especially valuable, here or on his blog.

It is a single reference and not precise enough to make the connection for sure (e.g. one would expect some reference to the double image). The fact that there is no other mention of this shroud by sources within Constantinople itself ( a city which provided quite a lot of lists of relics) suggests it was not considered among the more prestigious relics of the city.\nHowever, we know the Blachernae relic collection was first built up in the fifth century and we know that under the auspices of the imperial family, many relics came direct to the chapel from Jerusalem which  was still  directly under Byzantine control. The link between the two cities was considered very important after the empress Helena transferred two nails from the Cross to Constantine himself as the time of the city’s foundation in 330.\nSo ,and this is pure speculation, the Blachernae Shroud may have come direct from Jerusalem in the fifth century and remained in the Blachernae Chapel ever since then.

I suspect that we are not that far apart and you deal with the motivations of those arguing for the authenticity of the Shroud very well. As you say, most contributors have no background in the enormously complex world of Byzantine texts, where legend and history mingle and there are immense linguistic problems as well. I m not a scholar here but have immense respect for the scholarship there is.\n  I wonder sometimes if some of the contributors to Shroud blogs know ANYTHING about the years of patient study of Byzantine art and language the experts have undertaken. Yet some Shroud enthusiasts are prepared to make the most authoritative statements about the meaning of difficult texts e.g. the Twin Pearls or the iconography of the Pray Codex.

It also seems that there was a preconceived idea of what would be found.When the samples were sent off to Walter McCrone’s laboratory,  Ian Wilson in his latest, 2010, edition of the Shroud , notes on p.92, how the apparently brilliant McClone (who had  worked on Yale’s Vinland Map) was selected for the analysis of the samples and goes on ‘The expectation ( not least on my part) was therefore that by some equally brilliant feat he might be able to show the Shroud to be authentic’. Further comment unnecessary! Of course, as is well known, McCrone came up with a mid-fourteenth century date to the horror of the team.\n  Then Wilson tells, us, p.92 , ‘With the benefit of hindsight, the STURP [this was the self-selected US work team on the Shroud]were probably far too undemanding  in their sample requirements. Their ‘light touch’ sticky tapes did little more than kiss the Shroud’s surface’.  Well, that is one relief -who knows what irreversible damage might have been done with ‘real’ sticky tape?.\nSo far as one can see there are still samples from this 1978 raiding expedition around and they can still be handed around but only  it seems, after the McCrone episode to people who will back the Shroud  is authentic point of view . Needless to say the samples are pretty worthless from the scientific point of view by now and there does not seem to be a single hint from any of the samples that we have a first century artefact. Davor has explained the immense difficulties in linking a historical narrative which takes the Shroud back to the first century. As he says, surely correctly, it is not impossible that the Shroud is authentic, simply that Wilson et. al. have not yet come up with any usable  evidence to suggest that it might be.\nIt would have been better simply to have a traditional ‘Veneration of the Shroud’ guild and have kept the science out of it altogether. It is pretty worthless and the latest idea to offer a £15,000 prize for explaining how the Shroud ‘s image was made makes no sense  unless the Shroud is allowed to be properly examined under laboratory conditions and the samples taken from it that are still floating around returned to the examining laboratory. Perhaps the £15,000 can be diverted towards paying for this! The answer may well come back that in the present state of knowledge  we don’t know how the image was made but with further scientific advance it might well be in the future. In the meantime ,don’t fret. Keep to your traditional faith in Christ as a human/divine being and stop worrying so much about any physical objects that might have survived from his lifetime.\n\n","date":"July 1, 2012 at 12:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/01/sindonology-oh-what-an-awful-word/","cat":"history","title":"Sindonology: Oh, what an awful word?"},{"author":"menedemus","post":"DaveB.

The problem is that be seems to go far beyond the cautious findings of Byzantine scholarship and develops theories largely on his own initiative.\nRon : “One does not have to be an historian or a scholar to understand simple things like why the Shroud of Christ ‘IMAGE’ was not mentioned in scriptures or by early church fathers, atleast not openly mentioned.”\n I beg to differ, Ron. These seem to be to be very complex scholarly issues- the world of early images, as no doubt you will know from your close reading of the work of Hans Belting- is a  very difficult area.\nI don’t think the ‘antiShroud community’ as you persist in calling them, insist that the Carbon14 dating is carved in stone. Most of them are independent scholars and have the natural caution of scholars. A typical position might be be that a medieval dating (perhaps some decades earlier than 1250 if there was genuine contamination that affected the date)  is the most likely possibility but needs further work on it.  As  I understand Christopher Ramsey from Oxford  ,et, al, it is that there is enough debate to justify a re-resting but Ramsey still, as I understand  it, thinks a medieval date will be the result again. The issue rather is that no one has come up with any evidence that a renewed Carbon -14 dating is likely to come up with a first century dating.Until they do, a preferred date somewhere in the Middle Ages is likely to have most of the scholarly consensus, not because these scholars are rabid atheists but because they are scholars working on the balance of probabilities from the evidence they have.\n\n","date":"July 1, 2012 at 4:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/30/wilson-the-exoheretic-what-yes-exoheretic/","cat":"history","title":"Wilson the Exoheretic.

I just happen to think that there are many scientific issues which are directly concerned with the well-being of humanity which deserve the  £20,000 more than the Turin Shroud. Can you not find an issue that ‘encapsulates the frailties and pitfalls of empirical enquiry’ more than the Shroud does- it seems an odd choice to select it in this way.\nJesus Christ existed, he was crucified, he was buried in a burial shroud having been subject to horrific tortures before this. These physical objects, Cross, whips, Crown of thorns, shrouds, the stone blocking up the tomb, once existed but for many, in the Protestant tradition at least, they have nothing to do with the Christian faith. Some may still exist -one cannot rule it out-  however unlikely it is that a piece of cloth has survived two thousand years- let’s keep the question of the authenticity of the Shroud open, the Crown of Thorns might yet be found and the stone that blocked the tomb is probably still around in Jerusalem.\n Unless one can PROVE a supernatural explanation for the Shroud, which  may add to the faith of some for whom belief in Jesus and his Resurrection  did not exist before, I am not sure what the point of this exercise is.\nI wish someone could explain why the issue of not knowing how the Shroud was created is such a big one. It is only very recently with advances in X_ray technology that we have begun to understand how the first century BC Antekythera mechanism worked (see Wikipedia). The ingenuity of the mechanism has amazed experts who could not believe that the Greeks were so advanced. The Horses of St. Mark’s in Venice were thought to be undatable but finally analysis on the gilding ( largely undertaken in the British Museum) cracked the problem and dates them to the second /third century AD. There are apparently ( I have only read about this in a review) big advances in understanding fourteenth century painting techniques. This sort of progress is going on all the time. The pro- Shroud community write as if science stays still and so the means by which the image was created will remain forever unknown. This is unlikely if the Shroud is allowed to be properly examined and the latest techniques of analysis applied to it.\nDawkins can be challenged for his views on religious belief on many different levels. If you want specifically to challenge him on the authenticity of the Shroud, you have got to arrange proper conditions for a scientific examination of the Shroud by a team specialising in ancient textiles. The ‘list ‘is nowhere to start as any scientist would want to check it through, retest some of the results and probably think up a lot more tests to do to test the hypotheses about the making of the image which a team of bright experts would undoubtedly dream up. and if, at this stage in our scientific understanding , we do or do not understand how the image on the Shroud was created, what then?

The fact we do not yet know simply places the Shroud among many thousands of other similar historical enigmas- I don’t see it as standing out as something different.\n2)The question of how it was made tells us nothing about its authenticity. Science continually progresses ,as the ‘discovery ‘ of the Higgs Boson shows. We may yet discover a method by which the Shroud was made that dates it to medieval times, or we may find one that dates it to the first century AD. A lot of commentators ,not myself, appear to believe that if the image is as yet inexplicable, then somehow that is more likely to make it authentically the burial cloth of Christ.  I don’t follow that argument unless you are arguing that the image can only be explained as a supernatural phenomenon in which case it is, by definition, beyond the normal laws of science .\n3) The examination of the Shroud has in scientific terms been a mess. There seems to be no overall coordination by anyone expert in the analysis of ancient cloths, samples are floating about all over the place,there is no proper consensus about what has and has not been found on the cloth. It may be too late to repair the damage but  there is no structure in place for a proper scientific examination which would include a radio-14 retesting as well as retesting ,using more sophisticated techniques that are now available, much of the work done twenty or thirty years ago.

ANSWER IN ONE SENTENCE: WHERE DO THINK THE TURIN SHROUD WAS IN 400 AD?\n\n","date":"June 16, 2012 at 7:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"author":"menedemus","post":"Max. I am not criticising you – I am asking you a question. You are making an important claim- that the Turin Shroud can be seen in a mosaic dating to 400 AD in Rome. So the mosaicists must have seen the Shroud and so it must have been exposed somewhere. So I masking you where you think it was exposed,  If you cannot give an answer no one will take you and your many posts seriously and it is much better that you concentrate on your professional works for clients and do not bother this blog.\n\n","date":"June 16, 2012 at 8:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"author":"menedemus","post":"Again no answer to a simple question.Can anyone else reading this understand what Max is talking about? Can you not ask yourself Max what is the point spending so much time writing on this blog when no one can understand what you are talking about?\n\n","date":"June 16, 2012 at 8:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"author":"menedemus","post":"One of the main arguments against Rogers’ is surely this, that he did not have the opportunity to examine the Shroud in as much detail as Mechthild Flury-Lemberg did in 2002 which is why most scholars, and even Ian Wilson, accept that on the Carbon-14 dating and the possible reweaving, his views are not to be trusted. The fullest refutations come from Mark Antonacci and can be found online. There is also the very detailed photographic evidence that failed to show any reweaving.\nThe StURP researchers only saw the Shroud for a very few hours, in very rushed conditions, not even in a laboratory and it is not at all clear how the samples they took back to the USA were conserved and protected from contamination over the years that followed. We know ,of course, that they have been passed around, starting with McCrone, and then to others. I assume that many scientists would say that they have become worthless with time because of this- once the original context is lost, as when samples are totally removed from the environment which they came from, scientific work on samples becomes very difficult. We have to be absolutely sure that there was no chance of deterioration or contamination when the samples were distributed around the STURP community. How do they monitor this?\n In addition, and this is Ian Wilson’s view, not one of the STURP scientists had ever dealt with ancient textiles before they visited Turin in 1978. Imagine doing work on the pigments of a famous medieval painting when one had never done a course on art conservation. Certainly Rogers, if Antonacci is right, had no relevant background to work in this field.\n(N.B. As you can see I am relying on what other people have written about these issues and I am happy to be corrected if I have misrepresented anyone.)\n\n","date":"June 21, 2012 at 4:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"}]}
