My husband doesnt want to hear of these kind of stories at all. He said that they are not true. I am so sorry for him. Please pray for him. He is like the one Colton was asking did he know Jesus. Well I love the book, Holy Spirit came in to my life in 1994 so I know what Colton is talking about, everything is in Bible and Colton saw so much! God bless all the readers. Thank you for writing this book!.","date":"2012-01-13","mins":"3:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
