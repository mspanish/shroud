Finitude, class membership, and changing in time give rise to the concepts of essence/existence, form/matter, and substance/accidents. It is only important to understand metaphysics and to understand that it leads to the existence of a pure act of existence, which the Western religions call God.

In all probability, Jesus was buried in an identifiable tomb, rather than in a common grave for criminals. This detail is historically significant because of an historical event, the Resurrection, and an artifact, the Shroud of Turin. The Resurrection occurred within a few years of the crucifixion, and can’t be explained in terms of any other historical event because the followers of Jesus founded the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church rose to political power in the 4th century, and produced Western Civilization. When the Catholic Church lost its influence in the 18th century, the wars and genocide of the 19th and 20th centuries followed. The Shroud of Turin is a long piece of linen with a mysterious image of Jesus showing the blood marks from the crucifixion nails, whipping, crown of thorns, and stabbing, as reported in the gospels A heretical Christian sect probably created the image in the 1st or 2nd century with methods that have been lost to history. The faith response to the historical Jesus is to believe that Jesus is alive in a new life with God and that if you follow Jesus the same good thing can happen to you. The historical Jesus includes an accounting of those who believe in Jesus, those who don’t, and those who think believing in life after death is irrational.

After being crucified, his followers disbanded in fear and disappointment. Soon after, they renewed their fellowship and began to preach that Jesus is alive in a new life with God. His followers swore up and down that Jesus appeared to them after he died. His followers went on to found the Catholic Church, which gave us Western civilization. When the Church lost its influence in the 18th century, the horrors of the 19th and 20th century followed. 2) Proof of God’s Existence Jewish people are unique because the Hebrew Bible was the first book of narrative history. Also, they gave God the name “Yahweh,” which can be translated “I am who am.” This name was explained in the 13th century by Thomas Aquinas and is consistent with the cosmological argument for God’s existence. Most non believers don’t understand the cosmological argument. They think, for example, that human beings are collections of molecules, rather than embodied spirits. They disingenuously ask, “Who made God”? 3) Shroud of Turin According to the gospels, Jesus was buried in a separate tomb with a linen burial cloth. Also, the Resurrection occurred three days after the crucifixion and produced an empty tomb. The gospels also say that Jesus was beaten, made to wear a “crown of thorns,” and stabbed in the side while on the cross. The Shroud of Turin, which is currently owned by the Catholic Church, tells the same story with a mysterious life size image of a crucifixion victim on the 14 foot long piece of cloth. Many non believers admit that a crucified victim was used to create the image, but there is no explanation of how the image was created. 4) The Big Bang There are many other relevant historical facts. For example, in the 1960s it was determined that the universe began to exist 13.7 billion years ago.

In faith, we know something is true because God is telling us (e.g. Jesus is alive in a new life with God). The Resurrection is both an historical event and an object of faith. Faith is both a decision and a gift from God. It is wrong to criticize the judgment of people who do not believe in Jesus or life after death. We can summon people to believe, but we should not demand it. We should accept the response: I can’t see the truth of it. Another good response is: God has not given me the gift of faith. I believe in Jesus for a large number of reasons. It is the entire story that is persuasive. The Resurrection is one bit of data. The Holy Shroud is another.

If Dario Petrie doesn’t repudiate it, it will make the Italy Section of the IEEE look like idiots: Let’s bring to the heart of the problem regarding the quality of the submitted paper: all aspects of the TS invariably calls into question the person of Jesus Christ. The fact that the TS has been conserved up to now could either imply that it is a fake that goes far back in time or it is the true linen in which the corpse of Jesus Christ was wrapped. Provided the second hypothesis, corroborated up to now by stockpiled evidence, is assumed, then the resurrection of Jesus Christ could tacitly be understood, because if it didn’t the TS would have been destroyed in the brief course of the corpse corruption. Of course, this is only an example of reasoning. Note that even the scientific thinking advances, as the case may be, involving educated guesses, with all due respect to those which turn off immediately with apodictic – paradoxically non scientific – pose when the above mentioned guesses apply, say, to the Shroud. What exactly regards Jesus Christ as Son of God, namely His identification with the risen Lord, invariably needs to be referred to His incarnation. This applies to any investigation, irrespective of whether the investigator is a worshipper or not. Contrary to a stagnant gnosis, there is a general consensus on regarding incarnation even from some attainable, practical aspects. This is the case when attention is paid to the available attestations of personally or collectively tangible, palpable, detectable, intelligible experiences, as well as purely terrestrial events and circumstances. As a consequence, any sagacious investigator that deals with this sensitive topic prefers not to get the still unresolved, vague – to the point of boredom! , misleading problem, say, of the Big Bang in place! The resurrection and what revolves around this crucial event – this is the case for the Turin Shroud – has nothing to do, let’s say with different words, with the “Chief World Systems” and cannot give someone room to slightest hints, sterile and pointless appraisals, as well as pseudo philosophical lucubration to any large extent. What is conclusively demanded is that the author might be prone to appropriately propose any starting conjecture, at will, before working out a self consistent view of the matter; if not, the approach runs the risk to be a waste of time. Unfortunately, this is the case for the paper at hand. Roughly but bluntly speaking again, what caused the Big Bang, as well as taking a philosophical hike on derived issues, is not concern of this forum unless the investigation is, hypothetically speaking, so revised as to resolutely point, here and now, toward substantial, mature, convincing arguments focused on tentatively proving whether the TS is a fake or not. Since this is not realistically happening with reference to the paper under examination, then it is to be rejected without a second thought. Supportive of the above detrimental judgement are the following specific details: – there is a broad and valuable consensus in supporting the existence of God exactly through the Big Bang theory!

The second law of thermodynamics states that a gas will fill up the entire container it is in. This is a matter of common sense, more than a law of physics. However, this law does not apply to the evolution of stars because the law only applies to non interacting particles. For the same reason, it does not apply to evolution because a living organism is not a collection of non interacting particles. So, it is just as incorrect to say that evolution violates the second law as to say it does not. But there is a connection between evolution and statistical mechanics. Physicists calculate the number of ways there are to arrange N different objects: N times N 1 time N 2 times N 3 etc. Etc. Evolutionary biologists calculate the number of ways of creating a 600 amino acid protein using the 20 amino acids: 20 to the 600th power. This is the source of the misinformation that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. The American Journal of Physics published an article titled “Entropy and evolution” (Vol. 76, No. 11, Nov. 2008) with an absurd equation proving that evolution does not violate the second law because of the sun. The idea is that the second law only applies to isolated systems and evolution did not occur in an isolated system. This is absurd because the sun heats things up and causes disorder not order. The equation is absurd because it uses the Boltzmann constant to calculate the entropy of the biosphere..","date":"2012-12-02","mins":"11:24 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"id":"comment-19788","author":"david_roemer","post":"I broke down my explanation of why the American Journal of Physics article is absurd into eight steps: 1) Natural selection explains why giraffes have long necks, but not how bacteria evolved into giraffes in only 3.5 billion years. Evolutionary biologists always speak of adaptive evolution. The old model for evolution was a tornado hitting a junkyard and producing a Boeing 747 in flight. The new model is a computer generating a Shakespearean sonnet by the random selection of letters. 2) Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are connected branches of physics. The key variable in thermodynamics is temperature, which is the sensation of hot and cold. It is measured with a thermometer in units called degrees. The second law of thermodynamics states that a gas will fill up the entire container it is in. The second law does not apply to the evolution of stars or biological evolution. 3) Statistical mechanics is related to thermodynamics. For example, the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant and is a decimal with 23 zeros. 4) There is a very loose connection between evolutionary biology and statistical mechanics. In statistical mechanics, physicists calculate the number of ways of arranging N objects: N X (N 1) X (N 2)…. Biologists calculate the number of proteins that can be formed with N amino acids: 20 to the Nth power. 5) Because of #4, some non physicists mistakenly say that evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics. 6) Many scholarly works erroneously try to refute # 5 by giving an expanded explanation of the second law. They incorrectly describe the second law as stating that nature goes from order to disorder, thus supporting the idea the evolution violates the second law. But they point out that this principle only applies to closed systems. Since the biosphere was bathed in sunlight, the biosphere is not a closed system. 7) The idea that evolution does not violate the second law because of the sun is absurd because the photons from the sun tend to cause disorder not order. 8) The AJP article is even more absurd than this. It writes down a fake equation connecting the statistical concept of the “thermodynamic probability” of the biosphere with the thermodynamic concept of entropy using the Boltzmann constant. It thus produces an equation showing that evolution does not violate the second law of thermodynamics..","date":"2012-12-04","mins":"12:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/02/rupert-sheldrake-on-science-and-religion/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Rupert Sheldrake on Science and Religion"},{"id":"comment-19821","author":"david_roemer","post":"Dan: Granville Stewart’s paper (“A second look at the second law”) was accepted for publication by Applied Mathematics Letters, but was ultimately rejected.

There is the molecular machinery consisting of dozens of proteins. There is also the dynamic complexity of the ability of cells to detect their environment and produce new proteins to handle the changes in the environment (genetic engineering). There is also the process of cell differentiation which enables a single fertilized egg to become many different cells.

Facilitated variation is not like orthogenesis, a theory championed by the eccentric American paleontologist Henry Osborn (1857–1935), which imbues the organism with an internal preset course of evolution, a program of variations unfolding over time. Natural selection remains a major part of the explanation of how organisms have evolved characters so well adapted to the environment. (Marc Kirschner and John Gerhart, The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin’s Dilemma, page 247) By the time Darwin came to publish On the Origin of Species in 1859, he had amassed enough evidence to propel evolution itself, though still not natural selection, a long way towards the status of fact. Indeed, it was this elevation from hypothesis towards fact that occupied Darwin for most of his great book. The elevation has continued until, today, there is no longer any doubt in any serious mind, and scientists speak, at least informally, of the fact of evolution. All reputable biologists go on to agree that natural selection is one of its most important driving forces, although —as some biologists insist more than others—not the only one. Even if it is not the only one, I have yet to meet a serious biologist who can point to an alternative to natural selection as a driving force of adaptive evolution—evolution towards positive improvement.

If you say it came from a burst of radiation when Jesus rose from the dead, they will think you are irrational and unintelligent. We have a duty to preach the gospel, not prevent people from believing. Against The Heresies, St. Irenaeus, 180 AD They call themselves Gnostics and possess images, some of which are paintings, some made of other materials. They said Christ’s image was copied by Pilate at the time that Jesus lived among men.

The Big Bang is not evidence that God exists. It is rather evidence that God does not exist because it is evidence that the universe is not intelligible.

I don’t put Gould above Pinker and Dawkins. In the following quote he refers to “private beliefs about souls.” What he is saying in a dishonest way is that the human soul is not spiritual. He is smarter than Pinker et al because those clowns think the human soul is spiritual by definition. “Catholics could believe whatever science determined about the evolution of the human body, so long as they accepted that, at some time of his choosing, God had infused the soul into such a creature.
