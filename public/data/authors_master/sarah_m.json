They didn’t say why or anything but she figured it was because she just lost her beloved horse. It talked about the animals and the horses and it helped reassure her that Special had made it to Heaven. She told her sister to read it. Her is my best friend. She is not a big reader but read this book. In July of 2011, she miscarried triplets. She told me that she cried the hardest she has cried in a long time when she read about the little girl being in Heaven. It also gave her comfort that her horse who had died Christmas 2010 was safe. I was told by both of them to read this book. I did. It makes me tear up even thinking about certain parts of this novel. It is so touching and reassuring to know that my loved ones lost are safe and flying with the wings of angels. Strangely, when I say the “prince of Peace” portrait, I had an intense feeling of joy/sadness/and a large mixture of other emotions all at once. I believe this is true and will continue to spread the word to read this..","date":"2012-02-02","mins":"8:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
