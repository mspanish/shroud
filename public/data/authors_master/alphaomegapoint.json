{"misc":[{"author":"alphaomegapoint","post":"Hi, Dan Porter. For the details on how physicist and mathematician Prof. Frank J. Tipler’s Omega Point cosmology precisely matches the cosmology described in the New Testament, see my following article:\nJames Redford, “The Physics of God and the Quantum Gravity Theory of Everything”, Social Science Research Network (SSRN), Sept. 10, 2012 (orig. pub. Dec. 19, 2011), 186 pp., doi:10.2139/ssrn.1974708. http://archive.org/details/ThePhysicsOfGodAndTheQuantumGravityTheoryOfEverything\nAdditionally, in the below resource are six sections which contain very informative videos of Prof. Tipler explaining the Omega Point cosmology, which is a proof (i.e., mathematical theorem) of God’s existence per the known laws of physics (viz., the Second Law of Thermodynamics, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics), and the Feynman-DeWitt-Weinberg quantum gravity/Standard Model Theory of Everything (TOE), which is also required by the known laws of physics. The seventh section therein contains an audio interview of Tipler. I also provide some helpful notes and commentary for some of these videos.\nJames Redford, “Video of Profs.
