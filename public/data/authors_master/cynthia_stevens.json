{"art":[{"author":"cynthia_stevens","post":"I think it’s amazing that God apparently took a “photograph” of Jesus in the tomb, as if it was forensic “proof”, and left it laying around for 2000 years until photography was invented and the true worth of the Shroud was discovered. And somehow it escaped the craze for relics, so it was never diced and sold in little pieces. That, too, is remarkable. \nThis is a blasphemous and skeptical generation that loves to embrace their doubts. But doubts are grievous to God who has supplied us with abundant proof of His love and care over this earth. Someone said that the Shroud is the “Sign of Jonah” for this generation and I really like that comparison: that seems to be exactly right! (The quote is in this blog somewhere, if you want to look it up.)\n\n","date":"February 27, 2012 at 4:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"events":[{"author":"cynthia_stevens","post":"That sounds really good, quite a clever presentation with (hopefully) a good spiritual message.
