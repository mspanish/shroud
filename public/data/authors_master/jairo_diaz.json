This study is based essentially on macroscopic and histopathologic analyses of 3000 surgical specimens: 2600 inflammatory lesions and 400 malignant tumours  Based on the hypothesis of a collision genesis mechanism and because it is difficult to carry out an appropriate methodological observation in biological systems, the authors designed a model base on other dynamic systems to obtain indirect information in which a strong white flash wave light discharge, generated by an electronic device, hits over the lines of electrical conductance structured in helicoidal pattern. In their experimental model, the authors were able to reproduce and to predict polarity, chirality, helicoid geometry, triangular and hexagonal clusters through electromagnetic sequential collisions. They determined that similar events among constituents of extracelular matrix which drive and produce piezoelectric activity are responsible for the genesis of GTCHC complexes in pathological tissues. This research suggests that molecular crystals represented by triangular chiral hexagons derived from a collision-attraction event against collagen type I fibrils emerge at microscopic and macroscopic scales presenting a lateral assembly of each side of hypertrophy helicoid fibers, that represent energy flow in cooperative hierarchically chiral electromagnetic interaction in pathological tissues and arises as a geometry of the equilibrium in perturbed biological systems .    Pathological tissues are an excellent means of analyzing chaos states and molecular disorder, and identifying order expression through geometry and mirror images in the core of this biological environment, it is a unique fact\nIn a collision state, electromagnetic field generates electrons, and ions split-up and take opposite trajectories and travel to the boundaries of the system where the particles twisted 360° one of another, and appear as mirror images. In physics this is determined as chirality, and chirality is a property of most of the biomolecules. This means the biomolecules are able to produce mirror images. This is one of the vital characteristics that are seen in pathological tissues, polarization from its side induces chirality,\n NOW  please observe  , not  the image of the  man   that  appear in the  centrall   core   of the   shroud    ,  but  around it :  WHAT  you observe  are  patches   and  stagnant  blood ,   , please   observe  the  patches ,…..  what   pattern  has  the  patches?

Geometry that perfectly delimits the man body background. \n How   explain   that  a  man  body   are  structured in the interior   of  a   perfect   spatial hexagonal   formed  and   delimited    by  perfect  order spatial location of   4   triangles  …  how   explain this  visible  order  ? by     fire ,,,,,      scientists who have analyzed so far have focused exclusively  in the  shroud  man image  f without placing attention  un  the    patterns that appear around the main image   .\n What we  observe    here    around  the body it’s the   expression    the   we  called  irreducible  geometry     matrix  .  generated     by  the  piezoelectric  activity   of   collagen    This is the intelligent design that nature selects to generate order from disorder. These are not flat geometry; on the contrary, it has surfaces and volumes and is essentially functionaL ,  geometric order occurs through magnetic field activity In this magnetic domain are attraction and repulsion forces that interact continuousl This law is the only way to explain the elaborate and structured art-like mosaic images that have been documented   which means that there is a nexus, that is, an active intercommunication between these geometries that neither needs to be adjacent nor close   . In this fractal geometry, the distance of the particles is irrelevant because the entangled pairs are created. When pairs of triangles were identified   they become visible and identifiable structures. hidden variants exist and they become visible only when pairs are created. We believe that pair components influence the other component of the pair system even when apart. This communication behavior may come into play by virtue of a strong attraction developing between the colliding partners. that triangular geometric pattern represents for less the way to reorganize disturbed systems This complex is fractal always evolving into more complex geometric hexagonal structures over time-space intervals. It is a predictable and reproducible dynamic system. It is identified on systems in states of disorder regardless of the type of system involved. It has an invariant morphology with sets of triangular mirror images in opposite positions n conjunction with the dimensional organization of intelligent functional geometry   it is determined that an invariant single common denominator pattern can drive multiple change scenarios that emit the precisely shaped signals necessary to incorporate notions of location control.\n    Accordingly, the geo- metric patterns in the cloth appear to be younger than the spectral lines, the embryogenic bodies and the man im- age complete the end sequential space time energy sce- nario and are younger than the geometric complexes, indicating that the collision surface spectral lines geo- metric complexes and embryonic bodies were structured in a sequential way.\n Its this  only  theory?, “ bad  science “ munbo jumbo” “ mary  tortillas “  difficult to prove    a  profesor  that  “ Methinks a mischievous colleague has been sprinkling something on the Professor’s cappuccino that is not chocolate (nor cocoa, unless misspelled)…” (  colinsberry            your   attitude is not the problem     the problem is in your  brain that   not have the  sufficient synaptic connections to understand what we say  you are a pathetic individual , )  sorry, continue,,\nwas necessary to prove    to people   like   colinsberry   that we are were not crazy  or we were under the influence of substances like  “ cocoa” according colinsberry …     how to prove   TO\ncolinsberry       like  brains  that    the  existence  of    GTCHC   COMPLEXES    IDENTIFIED  AT   MICROSCOPIC   LEVEL    WERE REAL.?

The authors have described and documented frac-tal self-assembly of geometric triangular chiral hexagonal crystal-like complex organizations (GTCHC) and interface comet tail effect patterns in cancer processes. According to this novel observation cancer incorporates a real visualiza-tion world with a great surprising finding in biology, physics, and geology. This visualization platform literally allows us to see what would otherwise remain completely invisible. From theory to practice this irreducible geometric matrix allowed us to identify in geology, real measurable green infrared-electromagnetic stripe line in interface with hexagonal geomorphic pattern, triangular chiral pyramidal rock structures, geology well defined mirror images, template platform to bio signature characterization of ancestral primitive polar head-tail organization, embryoid and human-like shape pattern embedded as giant fossils in rocks that have never been seen before. Electromagnetic field released in collision- impact events generate in the matrix interphase fractal scalable invariant order of geometric triangular chiral hexagonal structures. The laws of biology and geology can finally be redirected to the laws of physics; specifically magnetic fields create a new kind of classification based on these fractal structural similarities of the relationship.   out to study these geometric self-assembly geological structures, ancient sediments and rocks that could provide insights into antecedents of life.\n GTCHC  COMPLEXES  ARE  REAL ,  DO YOU WANT TO OBSERVE IT     AT  MEGASCOPIC LEVEL ?

We are probably confronted with irreducible geometric matrix, noble structures that remain unchanged at the microscopic, macroscopic, megascopic levels during transit.    Under this novel observation cancer incorporates a real visualization world with a great surprising finding in biology, physics, and geology. This visualization plat-form literally allows us to see what would otherwise re-main completely invisible. In a brief glance, we could recognize patterns or identify suitable features in noise data—something that is difficult or impossible to achieve with more traditional data analysis. From theory to practice this irreducible geometric matrix allowed us to identify in geology, real measurable green infrared-electromagnetic stripe line in interface with hexagonal geomorphic pattern, triangular chiral pyramidal rock structures, geology well defined mirror images, template platform to bio signature characterization of ancestral primitive polar head-tail organization, embryoid and human-like shape pattern embedded as giant fossils in rocks that have never been seen before… please   go to this    article  and  observe     the  astonishment  images\nElectromagnetic Field Released in Collision-Impact Events Generate in the Matrix Interface Fractal Scalable Invariant Geometric Triangular Chiral Hexagonal Structures DOI: 10.4236/ojg.2013.33022 open journal of  geology .\n why  a  geological    journal published    a research  from  a  pathologist ? .  simple…  irreducible    geometric  matrix   …   GTCHC  COMPLEXES  its , AN    IRREDUCTIBLE  GEOMETRIC  MATRIX           THIS  IS  THE  BASIS  OF   ALL  OUR  FINDINGS   IN   GEOLOGY,      CANCER  TISSUES   AND  IN    EXTEME   INJURED  TISSUES   LIKE  A  MAN   OF THE  SHROUD .    follow  a  scientific  method ,  we   were  able  to  predict  an reproduce this  GTCHC   comp0lexes  through our    electro optical   model (  PLEASE READ  MATERIAL    AND  METHODS   OF  OUR  FIRST  PUBLICATION )\n “ I can’t understand why a doctor, a pathologist, with a string of letters a mile long behind his name, would imperil his academic credibility by signing his name to this paper,”\nI’m documenting what I see ….. in cancer  tissues  ….. in injured  tissues …    in  geology  and  now in the  Turin  shroud ,  simple        like  this ….

Carpinteri, G. Lacidogna, O.
