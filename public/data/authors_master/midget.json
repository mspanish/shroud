So yes to me a takes a small leap of faith and when other religions try to challenge me on the passage about having Icons of any kind in our churches it is much easier to say we do have more historical information to say these are not merely images made to reverence but that they can be factual since we now can put a face of God of the second person of the trinity. Where as the Gods in ancient times had never truly existed and were images created and given authority often from the rulers of their tribes or Kingdoms. I continue to pray that many learned people continue to probe not because my faith is weak and needs this information to worship; bit rather because it is neat to see the worlds reactions as we grow in knowledge that this can be for some evidence of Jesus Christ’s existence and give more credit in an unbelievable un encountering world..","date":"2013-09-21","mins":"10:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/12/ewtn-series-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"EWTN Series on the Shroud of Turin"}]}
