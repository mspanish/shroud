When the cloth was photographed, instead of getting a negative, Secundo Pia got a positive image, so it was like Jesus took an ex-ray of himself and He knew the day would come when people would question the cause of the image. In today’s world, we question everything and God knew this day would come and it would come at a time when our world would be facing possible extinction, when faith would come into question. This time is our trial, our time to contemplate, our time to believe or not, what is obvious to many of us, but it is a matter of faith. The definition of faith that I like best is “FAITH IS BOTH THE SUBSTANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR AND THE EVIDENCE THAT THINGS EXIST THAT ARE NOT YET PERCEIVED WITH THE SENSES.","date":"July 21, 2013 at 2:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/20/any-good-reasons-for-associating-anything-supernatural-with-the-shroud/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Any good reasons for associating anything supernatural with the shroud?"}],"misc":[{"author":"rosalie_giansante","post":"Hello, Dan:  I too hope to visit Torino during the exposition. It will be the first time for me and I’m really looking forward to it.. I have written a trilogy about the Shroud of Turin (not published yet, but hoping) and because of all the research I’ve done, am so anxious to see the burial cloth of our Savior. I believe it’s the first fictional trilogy where the people actually living at the various times intermingle with my characters.","date":"December 5, 2013 at 9:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/05/every-time-of-its-exposition-since-1978/","cat":"2015","title":"Every Time of its Exposition Since 1978"},{"author":"rosalie_giansante","post":"I was impressed by the History International showing of the Real Face of Jesus with Ray Downing’s fantastic work. In opposition to Denise Robinson’s comment, I don’t remember ever seeing anything in the Scriptures about what Jesus looked like. He was loving and king to people in need, he became angry with the money changers in the Temple, He exorcised demons who inhabited bodies of victims, He knew hunger and thirst, and all of these features showed up on Ray Downing’s rendition of Jesus’ face in three dimension. For years I’ve had a picture of Jesus of the Shroud and when you viewed the picture from a different angle, it changed into the artist’s idea of what Jesus of Nazareth looked like. Ray Downing’s 3D image is what I would thing Jesus looked like. Do I believe it is the shroud of Jesus? Absolutely. Those who believe need no further evidence, and those who do not believe would hold this stance regardless of the amount of evidence to the contrary. That’s why they call it FAITH.","date":"June 1, 2011 at 11:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/30/ray-downing-of-the-real-face-of-jesus-tv-documentary-received-an-emmy-for-stealing-lincolns-body/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Ray Downing of “The Real Face of Jesus?” TV Documentary received an Emmy for “Stealing Lincoln’s Body”"}],"researchers":[{"author":"rosalie_giansante","post":"As things are, it is impossible to prove that the Shroud is the burial cloth of Jesus, but by the same token, it’s impossible to prove that it isn’t. That’s what faith is all about. You believe something even in the face of impossible evidence, like when they said the Carbon 14 testing was conclusive. In spite of even that, I believed the cloth was the burial cloth of Jesus. Then when they said the Carbon 14 testing was flawed, I smiled because I knew I had been right. However, in order to prove the cloth is without a doubt, truly that of Jesus, we would have to take blood samples from the shroud and do DNA testing on it. That being said, if we do get the DNA, we have nothing to compare it to. We don’tr have samples of Christ’s blood. As a Catholic, I believe, without a doubt, that the Shroud of Turin is the burial cloth of Jesus the Christ. Would I be willing to die for this belief? Emphatically YES!!! That’s what faith is. Stephen should realize the Church is protecting itself because people are too willing to condemn our faith in a relic. The Church knows we have nothing to compare it to. We as Catholics believe, we don’t need hard evidence, that’s what science wants because scientists will not believe unless they can see and feel the burning bush. Again, we do not need that evidence and we believe.","date":"October 7, 2013 at 6:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/07/what-did-stephen-jones-just-say/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"What did Stephen Jones just say?"}]}
