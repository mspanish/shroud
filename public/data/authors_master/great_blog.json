I stumbled upon it because I was a little miffed at this article by Reuters:\nhttp://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE63A11W20100411?pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0\nWhere the include the now debunked C14 dating as evidence for the sceptics, yet do not go further to explain that it is indeed debunked at this point. I had heard about that earlier but was searching for the details. Keep up the great work, bookmarked for sure now.\nJust a quick reply to Ellen, you are ashamed of our church because of what the media is reporting? Perhaps you should be more discerning about how the media views our church and dig a little deeper into their stories and motivations to find the truth, there are many articles from decent reporters also in the media that have highlighted the pattent falsehood and picking and choosing of facts used in many of the leading attack stories such as those from the NYT.\nHere is one to get you started, to see what the NYT is up to exactly:\n“Fairness for the Pope: Pontiff not at fault in Wisconsin pedophile priest case”\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2010/03/31/2010-03-31_fairness_for_the_pope.html#ixzz0koQENSQg\n\n","date":"April 11, 2010 at 1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/04/03/what-is-bigger-the-shroud-showing-in-turin-or-the-history-channel-in-the-us/","cat":"2010","title":"What is bigger: The Shroud showing in Turin or the History Channel in the US?"},{"author":"great_blog","post":"BTW Episcopalian, do you have any info on this claim from the same Reuters article?\n“Then last year an Italian scientist reproduced the full-sized Shroud using materials and techniques he said were available in the Middle Ages — a feat that in his view proved definitively that the linen is a fake.”\nThanks\n\n","date":"April 11, 2010 at 2:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/04/03/what-is-bigger-the-shroud-showing-in-turin-or-the-history-channel-in-the-us/","cat":"2010","title":"What is bigger: The Shroud showing in Turin or the History Channel in the US?"}]}
