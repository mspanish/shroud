Let’s look at the top two flowers in your list, Anemone coronaria and Cistus creticus.

Their pollen is not identifiable at species level anyway. These are serious anomalies in Max Frei’s findings, and must be explained.\n\n Forgive my own lack of palynological sophistication, but Frei’s samples, observed on glass microscope slides, apparently had insects present on them.
