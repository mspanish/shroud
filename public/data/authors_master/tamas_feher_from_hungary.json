{"misc":[{"id":"comment-73360","author":"tamas_feher_from_hungary","post":"> Does the Greek Orthodox Church have a legitimate claim? Definitely. Although I think it is not the greek orthodox, but the russian orthodox, as the Russian Tsardom became the heir of the Byzantine Empire, which fell in 1453. After all, Tsar is the cyrillic transliteration of Caesar. Anyhow, I think the Shroud will return to the orthodox one day. Otherwise, there will never be peace between the catholics and the orthodox. I do think the solution to the marriage ban crisis, which now threatens the sustainment of coelibate catholic priesthood, cannot be solved in any other way, but by a re unification of the estern and western apostolic churches and learning to accept priestly marriage. Both sides need to make concessions (active contraception and divorce, which the orthodox practice, are completely unacceptable, for example). I do think return of the Shroud will be the final sign of east west reconciliation. Therefore its extended western stay does serve a purpose in the redemption’s grand plan. It won’t happen tomorrow, however, not with the kind of person Vladimir Putin is. The east needs to get its acts together, with regards to the several hundred years of backwardness they accumulated in the development of political systems..","date":"2014-01-15","mins":"5:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/13/when-is-a-relic-not-a-relic/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When is a relic not a relic?"}]}
