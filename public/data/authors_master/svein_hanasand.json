{"resources":[{"author":"svein_hanasand","post":"I am quite sure the shroud is NOT the one that was used to cover The Lord Yeshua Hamaschia. The book of John/Yohanan, chapter 20, vers nuber 7 in the Norwegian translation of KJAV 1611 states that the sweat cloth that had been wrapped around His Head  did not lay together with the linen clothes, but was folded together on a place of it`s\nown. Luke 24, vers 12 also states that the linen clothes were put for themselves. In my mind that most likely means at at leas 2 places. Why does not the Turin shroud story contain these elements? I remember havin read that thousands of men were crusified as a roman\ndeath punishment, and lots of testing of this shroud does not bring The Body of The Lord Yeshua into it any way. I think it looks like a religious hysterical wishthinking hoax.\n\n","date":"March 19, 2013 at 10:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/new-book-recycling-jesus/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: RecyclingÂ Jesus"}]}
