The non uniformity of the lighting has been discussed by Barrie in the matter of the Blue Quad Mosaic and similar non-uniformities occur in the backlite images.  Perhaps we’re just looking at a proxie for distance from the edge of the shroud.  That would explain the correlation but not the degree of correlation  If this is just a measure of reflectance instead of fluorescence then it is still peculiar that it correlates so well.  If your identification of the photograph as incorrectly communicated to Morgan then it merely changes what was measured from fluorescence to reflectance and everything else applies.  Why do we get such an excellent correlation?

The fact of the matter is that a correlation coefficient that high is hard to obtain even with only three points unless there is some linkage.  \nAs for wriggling, my main wriggle is the problem presented with the word “contamination” — we don’t know why we get a linear correlation in C14 age measured from the edge of the cloth and we don’t know why we get such a good linear correlation coefficient from the fluorescence data.  Because that is so anomalous and unexplained it is primarily evidence that there is a serious problem with the sample.  So I certainly admit to making a less than precise use of the word “contamination” — but as I pointed out the actual conclusion I drew was that the sample was inappropriate being clearly anomalous and I pointed out the other problems with it.  \nSo I think it is altogether special pleading and not science to pretend on the one hand that the correlation didn’t mean anything and then on the other to suggest that it means the cloth is even younger than the carbon date.  I guess having your cake and eating it too is a Hugh Farey specialty.\nThe Carbon 14 date is anomalous.  The absence of vanillin is an indicator of a much older date and the additional tests of Fanti, while they need to be further validated, all point to a much earlier date.  So the magic C14 date is not the silver bullet that invalidates the shroud’s authenticity.  There is way too much evidence on the other side of things to bet on something as frankly problematical as this bizarre C14 date with it’s high Chi-square and demonstrable deficiencies.\nIf anyone is wriggling it looks like Hugh.  \nRegards, Ray\n—\nRay Schneider, PhD\nAssociate Professor Emeritus\nBridgewater College\n\n","date":"March 22, 2015 at 4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"}],"events":[{"author":"rschneider42","post":"Of course the problem of creation of the shroud in the middle ages is addressed in the lectures.  Such a creation as a minimum would appear to require actually crucifying someone which is hardly something that can be casually explained and then hidden items of fidelity would have had to be added that don’t make sense since they would not be visible such as the dirt from Jerusalem.  The early provenance of the shroud remains obscure although the many reasons for the silence are pretty obvious.  I think the Hymn of the Pearl is pretty good earth 3rd century evidence that the shroud was known.  Then the correspondences with the Sudarium of Oviedo completely destroy the C14 as well as any fabrication in the middle ages hypothesis.  To ice that of course one would need something like DNA data which would finally make the correspondences between the two cloths complete if it turns out to be feasible to do such DNA identification.\n\n","date":"March 28, 2015 at 1:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/27/ray-schneiders-five-part-eight-hour-course-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"presentation","title":"Ray Schneider’s Five Part Eight Hour Course on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"rschneider42","post":"I’m quite sure that there are things I left out of my presentations.  I put the whole thing together in a couple of weeks.  It was a lot of fun catching up on some of my shroud reading.  On the electric field theory, I thought it was important because it offers a means of improving the resolution of a vaporagraph type image.  It doesn’t necessarily imply a Maillard reaction.  Any oxidation might be adequate in a surface layer.  The Rogers hypothesis just offers a mechanism for a thin impurity layer which might explain the extremely superficial nature of the image.\nIf Charles Freeman has a mechanism that is plausible or even implausible I’d be happy to include it in the future.  I have not encountered it.  In fact, when push comes to shove I’m not sure I’ve encountered a really plausible image mechanism yet.  They all seem to have substantial defects.  Some however are testable and insofar as they are tested we can get an idea of how far they fall short.\nI’m particularly uncomfortable with mechanisms that demand miraculous intervention or extreme mechanisms that are so implausible that they appear impossible short of miraculous intervention.  However, I’m inclined to cover them, especially if they have any basis.  I think Coronal Discharge for example, is pretty far out.  The degree of work that Giulio Fanti has put into makes it impossible to not say something about it.

T)hree dimensional: intensity varies with cloth to body distance so that rendered with that in mind you get a three dimensional image.

This is a question of fact which can be explored with science and technology.  The testimony of the shroud is something else.  It is a kind of 1st century photograph of Jesus Christ if it is authentic.  It has been called the Fifth Gospel for it tells the story of the passion rather directly.  That however is a religious matter and largely outside the competence of science.\nThe apostle Thomas had to see Christ risen and put his hand into his side before he would believe.  Those who believe with less evidence are not thereby better, although Jesus describes them as “blessed”.  What is important is the truth and the truth demands evidence. “Faith without works is dead” said James.

The Maillard reaction would potentially explain the coloration and the superficiality.  It does not explain other characteristics.  For that you need a uniform linear transfer mechanism of a reagent that would react with the surface layer in a very limited way since it can’t propagate too far without blurring the image.  It has to be collimated so that you’ll get resolution, and the reagent must disappear or be rendered non-reactive by transfer through nominally four centimeters of air.  \nThe collimation mechanism may be gravity or the electrostatic field (those are the two most obvious fields available).  The reagent might be materials in a water solution used to pat clean the body which came off the body in a very fine microaerosol which was neutralized as it was transported through air.  Some such process would potentially duplicate the image.\nProblems are that ordinary gas diffusion would normally tend to blur the image although a massive enough reagent would not diffuse as much and might solve the problem.  What I don’t think is particularly justified is a miraculous hypothesis both because the image isn’t perfect and there are image lacuna which suggest the image take up sensitivity is yarn dependent.  It might simply be a combination of rare characteristics that coming together allowed the image to be formed.
