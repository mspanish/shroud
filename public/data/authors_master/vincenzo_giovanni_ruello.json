In AFM yes there is a distortion rate of about 10% in length and width of created image but there is no visual noise. It is not correct to say I am overlaying images upon each other. The truth is when an image is processed revealing the positive aspects it is photographed or filmed. The second stage uses this image again tilted to an optimum degree to avoid length width distortion and filmed revealing more of the positive nature. A complete processing is difficult in one stage as AFM only works on sections at a time hence 2-4 separate processings. The illumination of the screen is what reveals the hidden elements and 3D hidden characteristics. The process has also been used for many years in astronomical photography, I recently learnt this where they photograph stars and distant bodies from separate angles and compile them to create the image so my filming technique has a foundation. I am the first to use this technique in the second face and all of my Shroud research and for this reason I have found misunderstanding and hostility.

These initial results show something strange and maybe positive. If these images are tricks of light they have done a good job in communicating to my mind what I see. Can it be a coincidence that images of a lion head or maybe a leopard is seen. Am still working on the photographs slowly gaining more clarity. My goal is to be able to decipher the back as clear as the front face. This is more difficult as it now appears we may be dealing with 2 holographic images. Am attempting to separate the images with more clarity\n\n","date":"May 22, 2013 at 8:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/20/the-worldwide-conspiracy-to-ignore-vincenzo-giovanni-ruello/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello"},{"author":"vincenzo_giovanni_ruello","post":"Spectographic 3D filming has confirmed the lion face","date":"May 22, 2013 at 10:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/20/the-worldwide-conspiracy-to-ignore-vincenzo-giovanni-ruello/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello"},{"author":"vincenzo_giovanni_ruello","post":"What is interesting Max is that some see these images and others dont.

I am sure a VP8 3 D analyser will prove me correct. Why has the front f the Shroud been analysed every inch using every piece of filming technology on the planet and the second face hasnt. I have used angular filming and spectography, I will be vindicated. I want Barry Schwortz , Fanti or any qualified photographic scientist or expert to analyse the second face and then the truth will emerge, I have revealed truth but it is at this stage only my word. When an in depth analysis is made and the images released to the public as I have done all will be much clearer. You say there is no conspiracy Dr Dan not about my work but there is a conspiracy,against the second face,tell me why it has not been analysed,all we have since 2002 other than myself is one positive photograph and one heavily banded black and white negative by Fanti. Place it under a VP8 3 D analyser\n\n","date":"May 23, 2013 at 9:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/20/the-worldwide-conspiracy-to-ignore-vincenzo-giovanni-ruello/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Worldwide Conspiracy to Ignore Vincenzo Giovanni Ruello"},{"author":"vincenzo_giovanni_ruello","post":"A silk veil has been placed across the screen to diffuse excess light and glare.
