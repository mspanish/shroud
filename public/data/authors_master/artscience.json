But the reason I single out your quote about the small size of the shroud is that I have seen it mentioned many times and even in WIkipedia as evidence against the PM representing the Shroud. There are many things about the PM that are ‘suggestive’ of a connection, but I think the last image on Steve Jones page about the PM is the most impressive and is almost completely ignored by all.\nhttp://theshroudofturin.blogspot.ie/2012/05/my-critique-of-pray-codex-wikipedia-1.html\nHave a look at the two figures attending to the left and to the right. Steve Jones emphasizes with a green line the flow of the shroud around the two figures. This is the only sensible understanding I can make of the two figures who otherwise seem to be playing a bit of tug of war with some strange material in the background. Without Steve’s lines I would have completely ignored what these two were up to, but now my attention is grabbed, there seems to be no other proper explanation than they are holding onto the lengths of a rather extended shroud (if anything its now too long!). Notice how the cloth bunches up towards the head and flows over to be draped over the man on the left. I’m sorry to say I originally dismissed Steve Jones as an evangelical nutter but he has pinpointed a very strong and hidden bit of evidence that what is depicted is actually very large piece of material. (For those who disagree, please explain to me what the two guys to left and right are up to and whats in their hands). \nWhilst I’m at it, can anyone also explain what is being depicted other than the shroud in the image here of Emperor Romanus receiving some large piece of cloth with a disembodied head.

He might have decided that his skill in drawing a body imprint on the cloth was not sufficient to distinguish it from an image of a dead and singularly unrisen Christ resting on shroud, so decided that herringbone texture was the next best thing. I think its an established fact we are dealing not the most versatile of artists and to add to his pains the necessity of showing what is a faint human body image flattened …now that would have been extraordinary!  \nWe know that witness testimony and memory can be unreliable, so he might have painted the nail wounds where people expected and also he was more interested in conveying the crucifixion and resurrection story than igniting an anatomical controversy.

In fact those key markers can be as minimal as a hairstyle (eg see Dali’s Mao Marilynn portrait, where he makes Marilynn Monroe look like Mao with just a hairstyle!!), or a moustache type (eg Hilter and Freddie Mercury impersonators). So I wouldnt be so dismissive of the Vignon markers as they would be a lot easier to add into a portrait than getting the proportions right which really is a harder proposition (I say this as an occasional portrait painter). Getting the proportions right are only important when you are trying to match a known person, where people with automatically feel something is wrong, but whey you are going for a iconic Jesus, I guess you can just rely on beard, moustache, flowing hair and some perhaps a hardful of these markers. Also Vignon markers would be a lot easier  to transmit over the ages than a set of proportions. \n If I were to try to test out the validity of these markers, I’d try and see how many of these markers appear in other medieval portraits vs the Christ portraits. Though I am not entirely convinced by the Vignon markers myself, I still cant totally dismiss them either as there does seem to be some sort of purposeful attempt to work at least some of these into the Christ portraits. Thats why I’m interested to see what you achieved by following these markers only.

I just thought I better make sure you knew that incorrect use of words can lead to difficulty understanding. I take it that you meant to say its improbable rather than illogical.\nThe reason I bring it up is in regard to above you mention above your point 3.2. I think it concerns whether a barely described artifact can have a big cultural effect. Many years ago, I got  interested in the effect of optical instruments on the history of art (see Hockney-Falco thesis). There seems to be a number of art historians (including Martin Kemp), who think it likely that artists such as Carravaggio, Holbein and others used mirrors, lens etc to project an image onto a surface for easy rendition of features, and this radically changed the history of art. However there is precious little documentary evidence of this. And you are talking about a number of centuries.  David Hockney describes it as “Secret Knowledge”, a secret passed on from studio to studio. And even in the cases where this knowledge isnt known, the new style of painting still becomes pervasive (see the followers of Carravaggio who tried to emulate the style without knowing the secret). So I think Yannick idea that a small showing of a naked Christ on a shroud could have a large ripple effect and without its cause been widely known, is entirely possible as an explanation of how come naked Christs come into vogue. Thats why I’d be a bit careful about disparaging unlikely ideas….change often only happens when something extraordinary comes along. I’m not saying this in necessarily the case, but art shifts often come from exposure to something different (eg primitive cubism from Picasso’s exposure to African sculpture in the Louvre).\nBTW I tried out some of the optical techniques myself and people were amazed at my much improved artistic skills, until I told them how I’d done it! Artists generally guard their secrets more wisely!!\n\n","date":"September 12, 2012 at 3:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"artscience","post":"Hi Charles, when you mention shrouds, were these all with an image and blood etc. and are one of these the Shroud of Turin?

Its an interesting observation but easily explained by Newton’s physics. The momentum of the lead weights makes them travel deep into the flesh, dragging the leather between them inspite of the leather having too little momentum by itself to penetrate the flesh. However the bit of leather attaching to the handle and near the point of attachment to the lead though dragged with the weight will flex back on hitting the flesh as it hasn’t got sufficient momentum to penetrate (in contrast to the leather between the weights which is constrained to be between the lead weights and so cant flex back).

You mentioned the fact that the blood appears to be on the cloth before the image,  hence ruling out (or at least making it highly difficult to get proper registration between blood marks and body). Just to drill down a bit into this bit of information:\n1)how do we know for sure that the blood was there before the body image – I saw mention of blood being scraped off in one place to reveal no image underneath. Do you know if this was done in a number of places or just the one? \n2)and how do we know that the blood didnt dissolve the image material underneath it? To answer my own last question, I think I saw Ray Rodgers tried various solvents unsuccessfully  on this outer coating material, but did he try blood as a solvent? \n3)do you know if the whip marks are a combination of welt marks (eg dumbell shapes etc) and blood marks. If whip marks are such a combination, they make a good study to whether it was likely that blood was painted onto the cloth separate to the body image.\n There was a method (certainly known during the Renaissance if not earlier) called pouncing by means of which a flat drawing could be transferred to another surface (by pricking holes along the outline and important contour lines on the original drawing, placing the drawing on top of final surface and pouncing with charcoal dust in a bag through the holes), so it is theoretically possible that a forger could know where a flat 2d body image would eventually lay, and hence put blood at the appropriate places before the image is transferred. This however would only work accurately for a flat image transfer, whereas a 3d or bas-relief would pull linen away from those originally sketched positions….Not to mention that it would be a very awkward way for any artist to work.\nSorry if I appear to have a sceptical mind, but its more to determine how much wiggle room there is for doubt.

This isnt that impressive as the flex is almost inevitable in real life but often artists will simplify especially if working on a small scale  like a coin. Why flex when a simple arc would do? I suppose comparing to other contemporary coins of other rulers who help resolve whether the artist went out of his/her way to add the inflection.\nThis does however lead on to a more interesting observation: if the Shroud did exist in 692 AD, and was displayed revealing mainly the head,  such that artists would quite naturally confuse a crease in the cloth of the shroud for the top of a garment worn ( you wouldnt make this mistake if the whole were revealed), would this help support Ian Wilson’s theory that the shroud was displayed folded in 8, just revealing the head.  If one presumes only the head was shown for reasons of convenience of size (the shroud isnt the most convenient of sizes and at 4.4m compares with Jackson Pollack paintings on width and awkwardness on finding suitable displaying venues) and mainly propriety (ie a nude would be scandalous at the time), it is quite understandable that  an artist might confuse the double lines of the crease as a  part of a garment worn by Jesus.\n\n","date":"February 3, 2012 at 7:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/03/ben-wiechs-video-about-the-justinian-coin-from-ad-692/","cat":"history","title":"Ben Wiech’s video about the Justinian coin from AD 692"},{"author":"artscience","post":"hi Charles thank you for that informative reply.\nI’ve thought about your shadow idea and though ingenuous has some problems/advantages in that,\n1) in order to make shadows on the cloth it has to penetrate the gesso layer which is a high reflectance surface (but again there’s a good test of this, hold up a gesso covered canvas to strong light to see whether there is a discernible glow, showing at least some light getting through). Next put a simple image (again say a 5 cm black X say from cut out card) and see if you can read it through the other side of your canvas with bright light passing through, testing image fidelity.\n2)there might a natural negativity of shades produced because say dark pigments on the surface, absorb light, so not allowing much to get through to the canvas, whereas light pigments reflect light and so perhaps allowing more onto the canvas and darkening the canvas there. So you might expect tone reversal as on the shroud.\nThe Zittau Veil, yes looks interesting in the areas where pigment has fallen off. I suspect not all the pigment has fallen off (a close up photo would be nice if you have) giving the faint image. You mention that it was keep in a steamy environment, so it is quite possible the pigments have leaked past the sizing boundary (weakened by steam) onto the cloth.\nThe shroud image seems to be mainly composed of darken fibrils with minimal contribution to pigments that have been detected on its surface. \nMy own theory about how I might go about making a shroud would be to get a front and back facing low relief brass effigies made (i.e. just like those used in brass rubbing but not so flat, maybe having slightly more relief differentials in the surface to try to capture some of the face subtlety).  These I’d heat to a glowing heat and the allow to cool and give time for  heat to become more uniform, to a scorching temperature. Then I’d apply the shroud on top but only touching the surface by means of a roller mechanism  (e.g. like an etching press). This allow a nice uniform contact time to be achieved and pressure deferential scorch image to be produced. Some tentative bits of evidence to this method is the presence of those awkward fold lines across the shroud….this is very typical of what you get if you use an etching press and don’t use the prerequisite number of blankets to press down on your paper – without the blankets the paper rides up ahead forming a buckle what is eventually squashed down as the roller proceeds, giving those awkward folds.  The shroud has a number of these running roughly sideways across the length (there are some longish ways that I can’t explain so easily). The other bit of evidence for this approach is that the areas with the smallest cross-ways width tend to be darker (i.e. as the weight of roller is applied over a smaller elevated section, the pressure is higher…..hence for example the head seems darker). This technique has all the relevant technologies available at the time form brass plates, to rollers. However there still seem to be lots of other subtleties about the shroud (e.g. the presence of fine almost invisible whip marks, no image under blood (if true)) that make me not completely won over to my theory.\n\n","date":"November 22, 2014 at 8:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/21/charles-freemans-theory-now-in-wikipedia/","cat":"history","title":"Charles Freeman’s theory now in Wikipedia"},{"author":"artscience","post":"Thanks Charles. Yep, only problem with trying to produce the shroud how it might have been say 7 centuries ago is we have no clear idea of what it looked like….was it in colour, were the outlines delineated, was there a background image, what medium was used, was there rabbit skin glue sizing applied? Still the fundamental question is how to get the faint yet detailed image onto  the cloth.\nWith the Antikythera Mechanism, we know for sure that its ultimate form was not to be a corroded mess of gears, but a fully functioning astronomical instrument whose predictions we will be able to verify as accurate by tallying up to know astronomical data. Whereas the Shroud in its present form is able to function as an object of veneration and wonder and who is to say it is definitely different to what it was 7 centuries ago (ok burnt holes etc and most probably fainter are different, but whether a full blown painting, I’m not sure but you might be right….I just can’t see the mechanism to get the painting transformed onto the bare cloth with such high fidelity)  \nWithout seeing the Zittau Veil in detail its hard to know how it compares to the shroud but I’d caution about jumping to conclusions that because on cursory  look it appears similar to shroud, its the same mechanism at work.

Now from the description of Cellini’s method it just sounds like the standard way I used to size my canvases (in fact most artists used to until modern methods came along within last 40 years). \nSo here’s the method: what I’d do is heat up rabbit skin glue till dissolved in water, and apply this solution thinly to the surface of the stretched canvas. Applying thinly allows the dried sizing to make a thin flexible protective layer (flexible so canvas can take knocks and recover and indeed can even be rolled up – Titian if I remember correctly, often sent paintings far and wide this way), and protecting the fibres from any corrosive action of the paint or paint medium. An additional gesso layer adds not only another protective layer but most importantly a reflective white surface that the semi-translucent paints within a medium (oil or egg tempera) could be applied to.\nNow the problem I have with your theory (unless I’ve understood it wrong) about the shroud being a flaked painting done in some similar such manner to the above, is that you seem to be saying that the painting done on top of these protective layers somehow penetrated through to affect the outer fibrils, such that when flexed over the centuries all that is left, after the painting/gesso/rabbit skin size layer falls off, is an imprint of the painting onto the linen a couple layers below. Can you see why I have a problem with this cornerstone of your theory?\nAnd additionally the imprint has 3d information within. \nI am a physicist and not very good painter (but I try!)  plus bit of an amateur art method historian e.g. studying how Vermeer, Carravagio achieved their realism. Whenever I see the shroud dismissed as a just painting I weep because that sweeping statement will convince many yet completely hides the many difficulties in creating the shroud. I’m not convinced the shroud is authentic but my scepticism also is honest enough to say that it is by far the most baffling artwork in existence…size, technique, novelty, subtlety, realism, surprises, details.\nBTW I did have a painting flake off in parts, and though I wasn’t really looking for it, I can’t remember seeing any imprint of the painting coming through. But in true scientific manner, rather that dismiss your idea out of hand, I suggest you try doing the rabbit skin glue, gesso, then oil paint (though perhaps in 13/14th century oil paints weren’t in regular use then, perhaps egg tempera instead) a nice big black X on the surface, leave for a couple months and then flex like hell until all the sizing comes off and see if the X appears on the canvas.

As I mentioned I most probably am leaning towards the C14  date being correct, but got curious whether anything can be made of the evidence going against this. I’ve never read Ian Wilson or the Acts of Thaddeus so most probably am missing the point, but from my (perhaps confused) understanding of this, I built up a picture of a possible sequence of events: that the Shroud (with image on it, and neatly folded and stitched) was interpreted as a towel and the burial clothes were some other cloths (perhaps the strips of linen, whether real or fake, the gospels mention). \nSo the burial cloths looked the part (ie what they expected to see) so were mentioned as such and the folded Shroud looked like a towel and so mentioned as such. An easy enough mistake for the writer of the Acts, if he didnt have recourse to unpick the stitching and determine that he had got it wrong. If I remember correctly one gospel mentions strips of linen and another mentions Joseph of Arimathea buying a large expensive cloth. Might these be distinct – why  buy an large expense cloth only to cut it up into strips. Perhaps the strip are to bind the shroud together onto the body. So I dont really see a cut and dry reason to dispense with this evidence completely, but neither am I totally persuaded by it. I put it in the “hmm, that’s curious” category.\nI might wonder how come no one around the time of Thaddeus thought to unpick the stitching and have a little peek, but then again it seems that it also took a couple centuries for them to unpick the backing layer of the present TS recently for cleaning and find the faint image (Fanti’s claim at less) on the back hidden side.\n\n","date":"September 21, 2012 at 1:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/17/tetradiplon-so-how-is-the-shroud-of-turin-folded/","cat":"history","title":"Tetradiplon: So how is the Shroud of Turin folded?"},{"author":"artscience","post":"I’m sort of surprised by Matthias description of Stephen Jones folding as strange. If you actually tried it (I did with a large bath towel), its actually very easy. But what I noticed, if it was folded this way, you might have to hold it together by stitches both to the top and bottom of the folded form. However if you folded it as Dan’s original graphic there is no necessity to stitch the bottom as the folds contain each other and hold together at the bottom but not at the top.\nSo you’d expect for Dan’s folding, there be stitching at the top, but isnt strictly necessary for the bottom, whereas for the Jones approach you need to stitch both top and bottom. I noticed that the illustration of Agbar has diagonal tassels at the bottom which might be due to stitching. I cant notice any at top but they would not be visible if you were doing a perspecitve view.  I also noticed that the image of the fresco show some sort of folded image (I’ve put the horrendously long link below), which seems to show very faint diagonal tassels as well at least at the bottom ( I’m not sure what the hell’s going on at the top, but I note that the sides seems to attempt to show some sort of folding…you got to zoom in to see it.)\nI also remember that there was another image of Emperor Romanus being given some sort of cloth with a head image also with tassels (at top this time, not sure at the bottom). So the Jones’s folding has a slight evidential advantage.\nI’m not sure what the Acts of Thaddeus are but I’m sort of perplexed that they being taken either verbatim or as complete nonsense. Now I’m not a historian, I’m a physicist, but I could imagine that the imagination could play a fair part you are  describing how an image might have gotten onto a cloth 400 years previous, but you might be a bit more precise about the foldings if the cloth were there to be viewed.

One is hearsay, the other you might be able to verify.

Your science is skewed again, Colin. For heat to flow from hot metal side of cloth to hot sand side of cloth, there has to be a temperature gradient, so if its hot enough to send facial information and pyrolyse onto  the sand side, its hot enough through the middle of the cloth to pyrolyse as well. So if metal is say 350 and sand is 300 and pyrolysis kicks in at 320…for the sand side to get a facial marking, it must have risen to above 320 due to heat flow from the metal side (and any cloth in between will be similarly scorched as due the temp gradient it must be above that 320 temp).

I also think it would have to be a low relief as well, because any bedding down movement might show as a blurring of markings.\n I think that rather than using a sand bed, instead a bed of dense but compressible wool, would help transfer the depth information into an increase in pressure of the linen against the hot surface (as I dont think the sand bed would be responsive enough to achieve a linear relationship between the depth and the pressure). The scorching on the top surfaces of fibres and the ability to scorch some fibres and not neighbouring fibres might all be down to pressure difference as Colin mentioned. I’m not sure whether that level of responsiveness in possible with a scorch image to give the subtlies in the Shroud, but some experimentation might give some indication of this. I disagree with Colin that just showing the principle is enough and the rest is arts and crafts – I spent many years working in transferring  theoretical results into workable technologies with sufficient fidelity ….sometimes its not possible. \nBut I agree with Colin that I wouldnt be too confident about the UV fluorence results if you are not comparing like with like pyrolysis results (ie image and 1500’s fire pyrolysis results as they were created under different circumstance).  I’d like to see the proper report on this as it seems like an important result to establish. \nHowever I still think the bas relief method would struggle to explain the faint image on the other side of the head given that the fibres in between dont appear to affected. Also the blood patterns apparently being created before the image (how sure are we of this?) I’d like to see a comparison of the intricate blood and whip marks, to see if these correlate exactly as they are precise enough as markers – I saw somewhere some very faint images (only visible after image processing) of the leather parallel strip marks that lead towards the actual whip wounds – that was very impressive to me.

In fact water has 10 times the thermal conductivity of paper\nWater – 0.56 W per m per deg K\nPaper – 0.05 W per m per deg K\nThe table seems to show that paper has one of the lowest thermal conductivities of the solids listed. On the face of it, it seems to be saying the exact opposite of what you are saying about cellulose….Care to comment on that disparity?\nBut I suppose the really important question regarding your scorch theory ….the big gorilla in the room, is the lack of UV response in the image area as Barrie Schorwtz kindly points out. In science, it is important to try to not necessarily jump to conclusions….I dont know whether your scorch theory is correct or not… but the best guide we have is to see how well it fits the facts, or in the case where it doesnt, give a good explanation why not ( and with backing experimental proof). So for example, to help save your theory, could you suppose show that the scorch marks reabsorbs oxygen (or is it water?) over time in such a way that the image still remains in visible light, but  its UV response disappears (I doubt it but until you try, you never know for sure)\n\n","date":"February 11, 2012 at 2:20 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/10/the-image-on-the-shroud-of-turin-is-not-a-scorch/","cat":"image_theory","title":"The image on the Shroud of Turin is not a scorch"},{"author":"artscience","post":"My point was to show that the major effect in your paper bag experiment could be explained by the conductivity of water, not of cellulose (which was the point of your experiment….so it was a  false conclusion you drew from your experiment).\nI did not say that the conductivity of water was the only thing going ….I even mentioned perhaps its was the thinnest of the barrier that allowed sufficient heat flow to stop hotspots developing. So you are putting words into my mouth. Going on to the rubber balloon experiment, the tables show that rubber to have more than 3 times the thermal conductivity of paper, so though rubber survived the heating, you can not conclude paper (without being water saturated) would as well.

I’m particularly impressed by the correspondences in the Hungarian Pray Manuscript, which I note you dismissed with some remark about the need to show puffs of smoke if its a set of burnt holes – that’s ridiculous (you assume the artist believe it ignited at burial?), it made me laugh out loud, I thought to myself “Here’s a man who really knows how to shoehorn data to fit his worldview”.

Well yes and no.\nFanti and Maggiolo did a lot of deconvolution of some photographs of the back side, and managed to derive a faint correspondence of the hair, moustache and nose, an even fainter correspondence of the hands area, and nothing resolvable from anywhere else. Given that the ‘normal’ image is entirely superficial, they assumed that the ‘back’ image was also entirely superficial, and consequently that the fibres between the two images did not carry the image through. They also show that the image on the back is not due to the frontal image “showing through,” as it might if it were much darker. They do not describe the back image as ‘smaller’; the correspondence of the bloodstains (which appear clearly) is accurate. They do describe it as having some slight differences from the front (specifically the nose appears more symetrical).\n\nHi Hugh, I notice that you are that relatively rare breed of being a physicist interested in investigating the shroud (as am I but without much time to spare) and you seem to know about Fanti’s back image.

One of my interests over the years has been artistic techniques and trying to unravel how various artists created their astonishing works. So I started to look at the Shroud from that perspective whilst taking in the information that seemed to indicate an earlier than 1300 date (much of it mildly persuasive). Without carrying out experiments its hard to know for sure but it did seem to look like a mild scorch. To get the projective image it had to be either contact with a flattened plate or something like Roger’s theory (I’m not sure about Fanti’s discharge theory nor the seismic discharge theories either as neither seemed to be have appropriate directionality). My problem with Roger’s theory is 1)resolution 2)turbulence and 3)being gravity dependent it only seemed to work for the upper body image, as I can’t see how the warm gases could move downwards.

So any fiddly details that have to done (eg illuminated lettering) is usually done by brushwork of the size glue and when dried to a suitable level of tackiness, the gold leaf is laid down and any excess not adhering to the size underneath is brushed off easily. The point being is that the size is not particularly thin, even if the gold leaf is. However one could argue that size might be diluted down very thin, so when it dries it becomes a thin layer. Which leads on to what I remember of Ray Roger’s theory that about the image layer (forgive me if my memory serves me wrong and please correct if you know better):\n1)the linen material was washed in some liquid for softening (cant remember exactly the reason), and left to dry.\n2)the water dries from both the front and back surfaces of the sheet, transporting the solute material (within the water solvent), to the upper most parts of the threads where evaporation is greatest, and slowly leaving the solute residing on the top creasts of the threads. This explains the thinnest of the image layer and its apparent appearance mainly on the creasts of the upper most sub-fibres. Apparently this layer can be removed by scraping or adhering to tape.\n3)Ray then proposed another theory regarding the image formation onto this thin layer by the Maillard reaction caused by vapour given off by a decomposing body (which apparently heats up causing some sort of convention current) within a very still air cavity. This seemed a bit more wacky to me as it didnt seem to have the necessary resolution, but then I remember from my josh stick days that whilst studying in a very still room, I was astonished to see a thin vertical line of smoke extend at least 20 cm from the burning stick before turbulence set in. Ray apparently have done some tests on a heated hand manikin and got encouraging results before he pass away. 4) the vapour also permeated through the cloth and again was able the react (less strongly), with the solute material again residing on the thread crests of the other side of the cloth (hence explaining the faint other image). 5)though I dont think this explains the bottom image ( as the convection currents work in wrong direction) unless that is all due to surface contact.

The veil just looks like typical first layer of “blocking in” areas in thinned tones (normally umber but I’ll take your word for it red madder) as the first stage \nThere’s an unfinished Leonardo, the Adoration of the Magi, that shows some of this blocking in but at a more developed stage. If you look at the less developed figures you see this tonal blocking. Normally the blocking in is done in relatively flat tones within a well define outline, with very little modelling and thats what I seem to see on the Veil Is there a close up of the Veil anywhere to see if you can see the gesso itself as distinct from the linen? From the close ups I’ve seen of the shroud there doesn’t appear to be any such gesso on the fabric, the image making darkening is directly onto the outer facing surface of the fibrils themselves. \nThe other aspect that is different is that the veil image is linear – i.e. there is a distinct outline  whereas the shroud shows no such outline whatsoever http://www.sachsen-tourismus.de/en/service/points-of-interest/poi/poi/kulturhistorisches-museum-franziskanerkloster-small-zittau-lenten-veil-zittau/\nIn fact this one aspect of the shroud makes it distinctly different from all medieval painting that I know of and I’m surprised more hasn’t been made of this point in the shroud literature.\nMost painting techniques until the modern age, starts with the line, defining an outline, which is then filled in, first with thin layers and increasing fatter layers of paint. The shroud image shows very little evidence of a linear boundary between forms e.g. between the body and the background, or even the fingers where they should be most evident.

This approach has made me re-adjust a couple of times….most notably with the Hungarian Pray Manuscript which I cant see really how any honest scientist cant be at least willing to put a question mark over the C14 dates.\nA straight out question to you, Colin….arent you just a teeny weeny bit disconcerted by the Hungarian Pray Manuscript? An itsy witsy bit maybe? I think we’re alone here, you can just whisper your answer in my ear ;)\nBTW even if the Manuscript were taken on face value, it could all be done with a bas-relief still (just added that in to allow  some face saving!)\n\n","date":"February 21, 2012 at 7:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/20/image-by-scorching-heat-or-science-by-hot-air/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Image by scorching heat?

We already know in the gospels that Jesus had been nailed and then pierced with a lance….and its not shown on the body illustrated…does that imply its not Jesus being illustrated. Nope, it means that artists dont put in everything, especially when somethings are a given as understood….making it all the more striking why include the details like the poker holes and the blood on the shroud and herringbone pattern, plus illustrate a Jesus naked and with crossed hands with missing thumbs (never before seen in christian illustration).\nSorry Colin, you give all signs of being from the raving bonkers school of scepticism, which refuses to admit anything at all to the other side (btw arent you glad I established that cellulose has a low conductivity inspite you resisting like I was extracting teeth from you without anaesthetic…cellulose having a low conductivity might help explain why there is only surface scorching that doesnt penetrate into cellulose)\n\n","date":"February 22, 2012 at 5:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/20/image-by-scorching-heat-or-science-by-hot-air/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Image by scorching heat?

Other peculiar aspects like abrupt striations (interruptions of the colouring) on many parallel fibrils, and the continuation of a colouring pattern across separate parallel threads (with a gap between), make the fuse wire theory struggle a bit there. \nI think the biggest problem is the double image on the other side, which Colin made two very lame attempts to explain, but to my mind are totally inadequate for the job. Fanti also dismisses another explanation that perhaps the image wraps around along the fibrils to the other side.\nPersonally I’m still keen on the theory as it has the possibility of accounting for some but not all of the characteristics. However unlike Colin, I am not willing to ignore data that doesnt fit in with the theory (that it is what I also call being in denial!), and I dont think its enough to say its done and dusted until experimental proof is furnished.\n\n","date":"February 21, 2012 at 6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/20/image-by-scorching-heat-or-science-by-hot-air/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Image by scorching heat?

The Pray Manuscript also blows a hole in the story quoted by Martin Kemp about Henri de Poitiers attesting (<1389) to having met the artist who created the shroud as the artist would have to be close to two hundred years old to still be alive. A proper scientist or art historian would try to sort out this extreme contradiction, and not just stick their head in the sand. \n But what I find disappointing about Martin Kemp's remarks (bearing in mind that Martin Kemp wrote excellent books about optics and art techniques and collaborated with David Hockney with investigating the possible and speculative use of the camera obscura in shaping art history) dismissing the object as being of painterly origins \"however it was made\". For an art historian, who has specialized in trying to work out how various paintings were created, to add those last dismissive words to an object that defies proper explanation by even the most ardent skeptics is a bit lame. Maybe that wasnt necessarily his intent ie to dismiss it, but perhaps he should have at least noted that of all the pictorial objects of virtually any era, it is the most baffling (and I say that without necessarily going along with the religious element). The Shroud of Turin stands out of the normal cannon of representational art, there is simply nothing that comes remotely close …and that should set art historians alive with excitement and not to just give the party line that it must be of painterly origin.\n\n","date":"January 20, 2012 at 7:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/new-book-christ-to-coke/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: Christ to Coke"},{"author":"artscience","post":"Well, Max, thinking about it, you do have a point…if I were associated with a particular university and I heard that our guys down the road in  such and such department proved this or that, I’d tend to give it more weight than otherwise, particularly if its a reputable university. We also know that most institutions, even reputable institutions can be hard to change their minds or even open their minds to the possibility that they might have gone wrong somewhere….way too embarrassing. To me it seems clear that earlier references to the Shroud, particularly the illustration in the Prayer Manuscript, shows Oxford, Arizona, and Zurich are right to attribute the date band to the samples they were given but wrong in attributing the date band that they did to the entire shroud, unless those dastardly cunning medieval minds also invented a time machine as well. As a physicist, I’d say the problem lies in finding a mechanism that would explain the discrepancy. That is really hard to do without further testing, so Turin would have to be more flexible there to resolve this.\n\n","date":"January 22, 2012 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/new-book-christ-to-coke/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: Christ to Coke"}]}
