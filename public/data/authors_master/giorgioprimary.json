Just pondering. John, we can’t just throw Gove to the wolves. It was the internal fighting amongst the US scientist and the insistence by STURP to expedite the testing without consideration for the British and AMSTAR who have yet submitted their proposals that prompted this action. There was another player who was very instrumental getting STURP out of the way, and it wasn’t Gove. Besides, what did Gove had to gain? The U&R didn’t do the testing either..","date":"2013-10-30","mins":"9:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/30/ideas-for-conferences/","cat":"event","title":"Ideas for conferences"}],"textile":[{"id":"comment-48253","author":"giorgioprimary","post":"The Fourier filter function is to manipulate specific frequency not to be used for chemical analysis. The image you posted is displaying filtered screen angles and nothing more unless you speculate the reason for the effect. I think a spectrometry would be a better tool for chemical analysis in imaging rather than The Fourier filter. The uniformity of the banding is throughout the shroud. Let me clarify what I mean by uniformity. Today, paper mills adds whiteners to brighten paper’s white. Printing over these inexpensive papers causes havoc. Because opaque inks such as spot colors printed on these papers does cause the inks to fluoresce, viewing in different color temperatures these inks will shift hues accordingly to the light source used because of the chemical make up of the ink. However having said that, because of the different frequencies and angles that the spot color inks are laid down on the paper, fluorescing becomes very erratic. For this reason I would expect the Shroud’s variegated markings to have sharp breaks and erratic pattern shapes not uniform or smooth transitions where strips go up and down throughout the shroud. Contaminates will also have been introduced throughout the history of the shroud creating a greater erratic patterns. That is why I believe the banding is caused by the linen’s converging screen angles and frequencies. Fourier transform filter is a tool to filter unwanted screen frequencies. Any further explanation why the banding is present on the Shroud would be speculative IMO..","date":"2013-10-21","mins":"11:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/19/todays-how-do-we-know-banding-patterns-and-what-they-might-mean/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Today’s How do we know?
