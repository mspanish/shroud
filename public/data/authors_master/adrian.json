I had polio when I was almost 10 yrs. Old and saw an angel when I was alone in a hospital school and felt abandoned. Just after I came strongly to the Lord, I was reading my Bible and closed my eyes to pray when I got a vision of Jesus carrying a little girl. I realized it was Jesus saying He had never abandoned me. Later my youngest daughter sent me a picture via email of Jesus carrying a 10 yr. Old little girl. I saved it as it was what I had seen in my vision. God has given me songs to write and over 1400 poems at 3 AM which are now being published on Amazon.com in books of 100 poems with the profits going to different charitable organizations. I have also written a children’s book entitled “A to Z Animal Stories” with sketches, Bible verses and morals. The author of the poems are God the Father, Jesus the Son and the Holy Spirit. God asked that my name not be put on them as He is the author…I was only the vessel He used. I have seen healings of my friends through prayer and know that God exists. I can’t wait to see Him and family, friends and lives I hope God has touched through my actions. I am grateful that I had polio as it made me appreciate all that I do have. I am blessed by God and I wish blessings on all who believe that Jesus is the only way. I pray for those who don’t know Him yet. God loves them too and so do I. Thank you Jesus that You came and found this little lost sheep! I too liked the picture Akiane drew of Jesus. I’m curious about the movie Mathrew want to see it..","date":"2012-02-09","mins":"11:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
