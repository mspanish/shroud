{"art":[{"id":"comment-4850","author":"richard_a_labrecque","post":"Just finished the book “Heaven is for Real”. Such an amazing story. I’ve always been intrigued by NDE but even more so now. I’m finding myself wanting to pass on from this physical world just to experience the joy of Heaven the way Coltron Burpo did. If God wants me to “come back”, then He is not ready for me. May His will be done. However, what bothers me about all the questions about “is God for real?”, “is His son for real?”, etc, etc, etc…. We all know what Jesus said to Thomas,,, so why not be blessed for believing even though one has not seen”. It’s certainly a better alternative. When you do believe (and I do) all thoughts about God,Jesus, Heaven become real in your heart and soul. The physical life you lead, when you believe, makes you a better person and one who is trying to do God’s work. The blessings are abundant. Although I’m a practicing Catholic, being a Christian and believer comes first. Let’s all love God and our neighbors as we are asked to do by the one who has given us eternal life, just for the asking..","date":"2011-11-16","mins":"3:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
