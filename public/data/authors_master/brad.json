{"misc":[{"id":"comment-36184","author":"brad","post":"There was one glaring technical error with the “Tears of Blood” episode….and it concerns the Shroud. Catherina Sforza decided to create a fake Shroud, complete with tears of blood, to distract the faithful from attending a Festival in Rome where the Spear of Longinus was on display. One problem with this fake Shroud is that the producers of the show decided to model it after the modern Shroud we see today…complete with the 4 triangular patches the Poor Clare nuns sewed in to repair the burn holes from the 1532 fire that damaged the Shroud. The problem is…this Festival scene in The Borgias episode took place in the year 1500! They even put the year up on the screen as the scene unfolded. Someone didn’t do their homework. They get an “F” for Shroud of Turin 101..","date":"2013-06-05","mins":"11:08 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/04/the-shroud-of-sforza/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Sforza"}]}
