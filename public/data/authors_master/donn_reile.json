If one did, it would be in a museum as the greatest artwork ever in the history of mankind. As for my theological views, they are mine and I am welcome to them, as they had no relevance to the question I proposed. I am still interested in the scientific findings, seeing as I have no access to the shroud myself, and even if I did, I lack the scientific intellect and background to bring fourth results.

The clumping of degraded fibers was so uniform and precise that a computer could translate the lighter and darker groupings into mathematically precise values. Which enabled STURP members Dr John Jackson and Dr Eric Jumper to make a 3 dimensional model of the man in the shroud. They did this by feeding the encoded values of the various groupings into a VP 8 image analyzer, a device normally used by NASA to make raised relief maps from non traditional, electronic photos of distant planets. Because the distances were so far, such photos were not taken by conventional cameras using traditional light sensitive film, but by cameras tabulating emitted light photons. With the encoded information, a computer could plot exactly how the shroud lay over the figure; where it touched and didn’t touch. The computer did this by revealing minute but precise distances between the man and the cloth. Where the shroud touched his body, the degraded fibers were clumped the most; less so where there was space between the cloth and body. The lightest parts of the image had the least number of clumped fibers. In this way, the computer plotted the peaks and valleys on the head, torso, arms, and other aspects of frontal, dorsal, and side images. Jackson said that relief 3 d image on the analyzer’s screen looked anatomically plausible, even down to the subtle details of the face. No known paintings or traditional photographs have ever yet yielded such encoded values and do not produce 3 d images. “Eyes protrude, nose sink, and other distortions graphically testify to the uniqueness of the shroud image,” quoted by Kenneth Stevenson and Gary Habernas in their book Verdict on the Shroud. The 3 d encoding also appeared to negate the image being like a conventional photograph. Traditional cameras reflections of light (more light causing brightness, less causing shadows) to make an image. But the shroud images didn’t depend on light (unless light had caused the precision degrading of the fibers grouped like pixels together determining lightness or darkness and hereby etching the image. The image just happened to look like a photographic negative. In reality, it was a mathematically precise map of how the body contacted the cloth..","date":"2013-11-04","mins":"9:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/should-we-be-reassessing-the-vp-8-results-continues-previous-post/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Should we be reassessing the VP-8 results (Continues Previous Post)"}],"researchers":[{"id":"comment-21503","author":"donn_reile","post":"Great video.
