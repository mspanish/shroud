I guess that goes for my novella joke as well.\nDavid, as far as “writings” Raes in particular, try contacting Remi Van Haelst, he may have had direct correspondence with Raes.  My collection mostly consist of HSG correspondences.  However, many of the researchers and various groups felt obligated to CC most correspondences to Farther Otterbein, who was the President of HSG.  Father Kim was one such person. Keep in mind, it was important to keep the Guild informed in all studies and formal conversation because The Guild had the best connections with the Turin’s Shroud authority to establish future testings and fundings. \nEventually, when I am done with studies,  I will be revamping the HSG site next year to include many of these correspondences. Some are marked strictly confidential which I must respect however, I maybe able to redact some of these “writings” and upload them to a site that will be password protected.\n\n","date":"August 11, 2014 at 8:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/07/comment-promoted-thibault-heimburger-on-rogers-discoveries/","cat":"comments_promoted","title":"Comment Promoted:  Thibault Heimburger on Rogers’ Discoveries"}],"researchers":[{"author":"gio","post":"\n\nIt's odd.

I wanted to bring to your attention an article a skeptic pointed me to on the Shroud online.

You seem to be very knowledgeable on the topic so I figured you might be interested.\n\n","date":"February 18, 2011 at 3:09 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2009/12/shroud-of-turin-is-burial-sheet-of.html","title":"\nThe Shroud of Turin is the Burial Sheet of Jesus!\n"}]}
