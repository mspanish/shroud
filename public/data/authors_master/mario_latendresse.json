The king of Hungary Bela III lived at the Constantinople court for almost a decade and was supposed to become the next Byzantine emperor. He was for a while second in ranking in the Byzantine empire. He most likely saw the shroud that was in Constantinople. Bela III became king of Hungary until 1296. Oddly enough, the similar patterns to the poker holes of the Shroud of Turin are now on this miniature drawn by a Hungarian monk in a clear context of Jesus tomb, somewhere between 1293 1295.

I cannot reproduce this on Firefox or Safari on a Mac. At which zoom level does it happen and which browser are you using? What might be happening is a gap of one or two pixels between the tiles when the Shroud is displayed. The shroud is displayed as rectangular image tiles of 400×200 pixels. I have seen this on the i Pad, but not always. (So far I attribute this to a Safari rendering engine bug on the i Pad) It would clearly be seen as a repetitive pattern of vertical and horizontal straight pixel lines right through the entire Shroud image and can hardly be confused with stitches. If you could attach an image of what you see that would clarify what is wrong. As for the level of coincidences of the Pray Codex miniature details and the Shroud, it is important to take into account the entire context and details at the same time. So far, in the discussion that has been going on this post, none ever refer to the essential fact that Bela III, king of Hungary when the Pray Codex was produced, had been at the Constantinople court for a decade a few decades prior to 1293 1295 and was almost at the level of Byzantine emperor while over there. He surely must have seen the shroud that was in Constantinople. Given the fact that the shroud of Constantinople is the most likely place where the Shroud of Turin was, this fact cannot be put aside. In your reply, you did not consider this fact, neither the other clear fact that on the Shroud you have two different patterns of holes: two with a L shape, two others like a P shape (for a better term, they look like a rectangle). This is exactly the two patterns you see on the Pray Codex miniature. These are two details among others. In any attempt to measure the coincidence of such depictions one is left to quantify the probability that all these details find their way together on the same small miniature drawing. And again taking into the global context of the relation of Bela III and Constantinople. (Of course, you already know that the king is financially supporting the Benedictin monastery where the monks lived.) We could actually model such coincidences.

I am not sure I understand your question since I do see an L form in two places, one of them more prominent than the other, as well as two P like forms. In the case of the latter they look like a rectangle, perhaps we should call them O form? I did draw four L forms to point out the fact that the four patterns go together as if something that was burning on one panel (assuming the Shroud was folded) made it through the other panels of the Shroud. This is clearly a simplification of what we can readily see, since some locations have different number of holes. Do you agree? 2. You want to know the coordinates of the L and P forms on the Shroud Scope? This is essentially what I sent in the last post for the L form. The URL contains the coordinates. Note that these coordinates depend on the zoom level. Here is the URL to one L form, I am sure you can find the others (one other L and two P like forms) by panning an changing the zoom level. Http://www.dshroud.com/shroud Scope/shroud Scope.shtml?zl=8&image=3&lon=3482&lat=12552.5&poker=t Notice the lat and lon parameters (the coordinates), as well as the zl (zoom level) parameter in this URL. Does it work for you? 3. The assumption that Bela III saw the shroud in Constantinople is based on common sense and knowledge of what the Byzantine Empire was all about. The Byzantine Empire was a state centered on Christ. The Emperor was often depicted as servant of Christ. The relics of Christ were the most important treasure of the Byzantine Empire. Bela III was the heir of the Byzantine Empire, second only to the Empire. Bela III was sent to Constantinople to further is education. Between the statements that Bela III “never saw” the shroud and he “saw” the shroud, I conclude that the second one is most likely. 4. There was a shroud in Constantinople. This is based on several written documents. The question is: was the shroud in Constantinople the Shroud of Turin? But this is the whole discussion of this post. And your question appears to be formulated as if you are assuming that there is no evidence at all (written or otherwise) that no shroud of Christ was reported to exist in Constantinople. This would contradict many written documents. Do you agree that there is a reported (by various written documents) shroud of christ in Constantinople? 5. There are probably many such representations of the Shroud weave during medieval time. There is of course the Lirey Medallion (still at the Cluny Museum in Paris) and for example the following Notice that the church housing this fresco was constructed in 1164 as a foundation of Alexius Angelus Comnenus, a son of Constantine Angelos and Theodora Komnene, a daughter of Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos.

From Wikipedia on Manuel I Komnenos: “The Hungarian heir Béla, younger brother of the Hungarian king Stephen III, was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the court of Manuel, who intended the youth to marry his daughter, Maria, and to make him his heir, thus securing the union of Hungary with the Empire. In the court Béla assumed the name Alexius and received the title of Despot which had previously been applied only to the Emperor himself. However, two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation. In 1169, Manuel’s young wife gave birth to a son, thus depriving Béla of his status as heir of the Byzantine throne (although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary). Then, in 1172, Stephen died childless, and Béla went home to take his throne. Before leaving Constantinople, he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always “keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans”. Béla III kept his word: as long as Manuel lived, he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance, which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary”. I found it very likely that Béla had seen the Shroud in Constantinople. This is most likely the location of the Shroud around 1172. Béla left Constantinople well before 1192 and remained king of Hungary until 1196. That makes a very strong connection between the Shroud and Hungary, therefore to the Pray Codex..","date":"2012-06-05","mins":"5:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/02/a-masterly-demolition-of-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript/","cat":"art","title":"A Masterly Demolition of the Hungarian Pray Manuscript?"},{"id":"comment-8007","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"For a Byzantine coin representing Christ with a swelling cheek, an impressive example is from the reign of Constantine VII.

It might also point to the presence of the Manoppello veil in Constantinople as has been hinted by Max Patrick Hamon. The idea that the nose is curved on the Shroud is not exactly correct. It appears curved since one side of the face is more prominent than the other. Drawing a straight line from the top of the nose to its tip shows a very slight curve, but so small that we could not describe this as curved.

In other words, the parameter needed is not essential, nor unique.

Moreover, Campin was a master at reproducing elaborate (near photographic) details of reality not done by most painters of his time: he took care of reproducing the material reality of the Veil of Veronica which he perceived as transparent or knew to be transparent. Such a detail would not have been reproduced by Campin if he did not have strong evidence that it was transparent.

I have not located these representations yet). Although, the “notched” is quite prominent on the Shroud. As can readily be seen on the Shroud, some other “Gammas” are without a notch because the poker holes were not done completely through the Shroud when it was folded. The symbolism of the Gamma was still used in the fifth and sixth centuries by Christians. It could have been done during that period.

For example, if a small section of 10 pixels by 10 pixels is selected to represent the tip of the nose from the back surface, the very bright spot that is visible can be selected, then a similar section on the front surface can be selected where the nose is. Also, the tendency to increase would apply for one specific photograph that was used to find a maximum match, not necessarily for all of them. This is the case for the first column of Table 1.

But I think the arguments that you gave, apparently coming from many other people at the St Louis conference, are not valid. You wrote: JM: “And if another test is done and it comes out 1st century, don’t you think the skeptics would constantly bring out facts that they think invalidated the results?” ML: Any invalid arguments can be used by anybody. No research would be done if we were expecting everybody to agree. But correctly performed tests clarify open questions. JM: “As several people at the conference pointed out, if another C 14 test was done and didn’t come out 1st century for whatever reason, the case for the Shroud’s authenticity would effectively be over.” ML: First, not “come out 1st century”, may mean anything beside 1st century, which include spurious results such as 4th century, 8th century, in the future (yes, that is possible), and so on. A non 1st century in discordance with the 1988 result would point out that something is going wrong and some unforeseen factors are involved. Or, the samples that would be analyzed could point to new results. These are possible outcomes. This is a major new result that does not point to non authenticity. On the contrary, it would invalidate the certainty of the 1988 radiocarbon dating. Second, being afraid of a result that would not point to authenticity is not at all what should be expected from researchers. JM: “Prof. Barberis has apparently been trying for 10 years to get an international commission formed to look at the problems of carbon dating the Shroud. I think that if a good commission was formed and an appropriate protocol was produced, it would be possible to do a legitimate C 14 test.” This is a good initiative by Prof. Barberis. A second radiocarbon dating is needed to move ahead. One aspect that is needed for this second dating is the involvement of various groups of people, some that are known to be against and other for the authenticity of the Shroud. It is unfortunately needed in the case of the Shroud.

So the answer is embedded in the question: it is none. “Where is the C 14 baseline for such an anomalous item?” Anomalous, or unique? Radiocarbon dating would be affected by uniqueness? “We still haven’t discerned the means of image formation.” We have not yet understood how the universe came to be, yet we have estimated its age and we are still refining it. Granted, this estimation can be repeated at will and by everybody, which is therefore more thrusted than the 1988 radiocarbon dating of the Shroud or any future radio carbon dating of the Shroud, which cannot be repeated at will and by everybody. “So how do we know C 14 dating, regardless of what date it produces, is the definitive method for dating such an anomalous object?” The C 14 dating would prove itself to be unreliable on the Shroud if it shows inconsistent dates. Otherwise it becomes more consistent. Consistency of radiocarbon dating on the Shroud is at the heart of many discussion in Shroud research. Let’s verify this level of consistency. “Of course if one assumes the cloth is medieval it’s trajectory through the last few hundred years can be accounted for better. C 14 seems an obvious method to use.” The medieval period is from the 5th to the 15th century. If a second radiocarbon dating gives the 5th century, it becomes inconsistent and unreliable. “But if one assumes it is 1st century, the question marks one encounters are exponentially multiplied.” Consistency is what is going to be verified.

First, the erroneous statements about networking. Dr. Jull wrote “Indeed, in 1988 the internet (as we know it today) didn’t exist – there was a pre existing network run by the US government which was quite restricted.” A) This is irrelevant because as soon as you can connect to a computer you can potentially hack it remotely, no Internet, as we know it today, is needed. B) It is erroneous: there were many large scale networks between universities, data centers, and government employees before 1988. In 1978, I was programming a computer located 250km away from my school and communicating with many other users at many other schools throughout the province of Quebec. By some accident, I turned out to be able to read all file names on some disks at the ministry of education. This is unthinkable today in terms of security. In 1981, I was working in a government data center in the province of Ontario. Their Amdhal V8 was connected to over 1000 terminals across the province of Ontario. From 1983 to 1989, I was programming a computer at the school I was teaching via a modem from my home. Remotely hacking computers was possible prior to 1988 and it was done. Of course, many people can attest to large scale networking in the early 1980s. Prof. Ramsey wrote: “Yes – I agree with all that Tim says. This would seem to be a suggestion from someone who does not know what computers were like in the 1980s.” This is unfortunately the opposite because Prof. Ramsey is either saying that large scale computer networking was not common back then, or that hacking computers (remotely or not) was not possible, but in both cases it was possible and done. That definitely may not apply to any computer used by the radio carbon dating labs, and only the persons that knew precisely their set up could answer. Second, the confusing statements about the calculation of ages based on the C14 and C13 counts. Dr. Jull wrote: “This is impossible. In our case, the software for the calculations is offline. In any case, the calculation does NOT require software, it was done offline and plotted on a graph, as I recall”. This is confusing. He wrote “the software for the calculations is offline”, so that means they were using a software on some computer, then “the calculation does NOT require software, it was done offline and plotted on a graph”. Why to state that it does not require a software? Does it mean that it was done by hand? Were they or not using a software to do the calculation? I can’t tell from these two statements. Prof Ramsey wrote: “Age calculation was done offline and could just be done with a calculator, or by a simple program into which you typed the numbers from the AMS.” That simply says that the calculation was simple, but that still does not say if a computer was used or not in the case of the dating of the Shroud..","date":"2014-04-02","mins":"1:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/01/developing-a-hacking-theory/","cat":"hacking","title":"Developing a Hacking Theory"},{"id":"comment-11719","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Three things about this paper: (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248412000425) 1) Notice that one of the co author is Dr. Thomas Ramsey from the Oxford lab. 2) The authors do report issues about decontamination of bones to get accurate result with radio carbon dating.

I do not think that. My first point is that there is not enough information provided with the spectrum to do its full analysis, in particular the temperature at which the spectrum was created and the energy of the ionization that was used for that spectrum. Also, it would require several spectra of that sample at different time during pyrolysis to help confirm the identity of the molecules involved. On the other hand, the spectrum is not very far from what Rogers concluded, in particular, furfural appears present in that spectrum and the intensity at m/z 126 is negligible. My second point is that you made an error by over interpreting that spectrum, in particular by asserting that by removing what you call the “contaminant” you would get the same spectrum as the image only sample. But without identifying precisely that contaminant, it is not possible to come to that conclusion. You would need to quantify every peak of the contaminant, which you have not done, and which is not even possible to do given this single spectrum. You also made a clear call on m/z 126, stating that it would become a value similar to the spectrum from the image only sample once the contaminant was removed. But, this is arithmetically impossible, if you do some simple calculation, whatever that contaminant is. (multiple by 4 (the ratio for m/z 131 between the two spectra) the near zero value of m/z 126, and you certainly cannot get close to 25 as in the image only spectrum.) In other words, something else appears at play with that spectrum and it could be what Rogers concluded or something more complex: gum Arabic mixed with sebum and some cellulose, or gum Arabic with some other material, or sebum with cellulose, etc. Also, let’s not forget that the gum Arabic identification in Rogers’ paper was not based only on the spectrum. So a full appreciation of its conclusion is not strictly based on that spectrum. How do you classify “pseudo science”? Would an invalid manipulation of a spectrum be classified as “pseudo science”?.","date":"2015-09-23","mins":"3:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/14/the-chemist-rogers-and-plastic-bags/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Chemist Rogers and Plastic Bags"},{"id":"comment-210540","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Marco Bella wrote: “… there is no significant difference between the two spectra, except the contaminant. Whatever it is, it should not be there.” But then a few days later you wrote “it is compatible with the presence on Raes sample of “oligomers from polyethylene””. So, your determination of the M n14 peaks are definitively oligomers from polyethylene? I would revise this statement, see for example http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142941812000256 The mass spectra would have m/z values way above 500 for oligomers coming from polyethylene. Besides, this polyethylene contaminant should be so small that the spectra of the pyrolysis of the sample itself would have the major abundances, not the other way around. When you wrote your editorial publication you only gave a very general class of molecules for the contaminant (long hydrocarbon chains), which I believe is the only possible conclusion given the lack of more mass spectra at/of different times/temperatures. A more precise determination would require an identification of the other peaks, in particular peak m/z 131, which you have not identified its provenance. But more importantly, your determination of the abundance of m/z 96 coming from the “contaminant” is unproven in your publication because until you know the other molecule(s) involved in that spectra (and the exact “contaminant” molecular structure), you cannot determine the relative abundance for the m/z 96 peak coming from the “contaminant”. It can be a combination of two or more fragments of two or more different molecules interfering in the mass spectra. Also, your statement that the relative abundance of m/z 126 would be non zero when removing that “contaminant” spectra is odd. The mass spectra shows a relative abundance of zero for m/z 126, and this is all that can be said. In summary, your statement that the two mass spectra are identical once the “contaminant” mass spectra is removed is at least very approximate but essentially unproven. And what you consider a “contaminant” can actually be coming directly from the sample, in particular from sebum, which is mostly made of lipids, and the fact that this section of the Shroud has been heavily hand manipulated to hold and display the Shroud..","date":"2015-09-16","mins":"3:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/14/the-chemist-rogers-and-plastic-bags/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Chemist Rogers and Plastic Bags"},{"id":"comment-216810","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"A short communication answering the Bella et al.

As I wrote, ” blood impregnates the hair locks whose roots are in/near the injury”. » So, you agree on the main point I made on my first comment of this post: in the paper by Lind & Antonacci (the main subject of this post), it is stated that the blood stains from the back of the head are not natural and therefore that the blood stains come from the scalp, not the hair. That may sound strange, but this is what the paper says. I quote their paper “Direct contact alone cannot embed all the Shroud’s various blood marks with their complete and intimate features.” So, how do these blood stains come from the scalp and not from the hair according to Lind & Antonacci? The body dematerialize and re materialize: the transfers of blood is not occurring by “simple” contact, but when the body dematerialize and goes through the cloth, then when the body materialize again (resurrection)! This is essentially Jackson’s hypothesis. This is very far fetched (with all respects to the authors). Did you notice that general theory to explain the blood stains in their paper? Again, the main problem is the following: This scenario (i.e., body disappear and reappear), as presented in that paper, is based on the assumption that the blood stains cannot have been produced by simple contact from the hair. This point is a fundamental premise that must be proven and discussed before going any further. But this point is not even discussed and nobody has ever proven that point (again not even Lavoie ever discussed at length that point and proved that the blood stains cannot come from the hair). This is major flaw of this paper. You made the statement that the rivulet looking bloodstains we see from the hair, from the front, on the side of the face cannot come from the hair. Any proof of that? How can you prove that? I think the burden of proof is on the person making that claim. Of course, blood does not typically behaves the same if it is transferred from the skin or the hair. The main difference is that the density of blood that can be transferred, if no pressure is applied, is going to be larger from the skin when compared to the hair. This is exactly what is happening when considering the photos taken from the recto (underside) of the Shroud, in 2000 (See “Shroud Images 2000”, published by Editrice, 2001). From these images we can see that all bloodstains from the hair on the sides of the face, in particular the rivulet ones, did not penetrate through the cloth, as far as it is possible to see from Fig. 5 of that book. That means that a smaller density of blood transfer occurred at these locations, which is coherent with a transfer from hair, not from skin. All blood stains coming from the skin in the face transfers as coming from the skin. This is an import point to notice when discussing the blood transfers of hair vs skin. And, there is nothing extraordinary about these rivulet like looking blood stains in the hair. I see them as, for example, simply locks of hair with blood on them that slightly touch the Shroud. I could produce some photos of such transfer, but they will be very simple and nothing special (I did some many years ago). What does prevent this possibility? It is quite straightforward..","date":"2015-01-06","mins":"11:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/04/unique-blood-marks-explained/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Unique Blood Marks Explained?"},{"id":"comment-181898","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Hi Thibault, Yes, a terrible terrorist attack just happened in Paris.

There are at least two types of bloodstains coming from the hair that should be considered separately. 1) The bloodstains that appear coming from pressure, such as the ones on the back of the head. 2) The bloodstains that appear not coming pressure, such as the ones from the front side. They do appear differently. Right? You wrote: “There are blood images in the hair (frontal side) which are NOT consistent with this fact. Mainly the winding blood mark seen in the hair area (front side). It is simply impossible even if “the hair is compressed against the bloody wounds on the scalp and the blood seeps through the hair” The compressed explanation I gave, is for the back, not the front. The bloodstains you mentioned, coming from the front on the side of the face, cannot be coming directly from the scalp, because these bloodstains are far away from the scalp. They could simply be coming from the hair from blood that drips from the head into the side hair. I could should you such transfer, from hair to cloth by using a viscous liquid. They look similar as we see on the Shroud. As for the back, they do not look much like rivulets of blood. They look like compressed hair with blood in them that is pressed onto a cloth. I can show some similar transfer as well. Remember what is claimed, and what you wrote: “It is simply impossible”, which means that you have to show that there is no way these bloodstains cannot come from the hair. But I see no clear explanation (from Lavoie, Lind or Antonacci) of such impossibility and no experiment done. I want to emphasize this point because it is important: At no point in any of the papers written by Lavoie (probably 3 such papers in various publications like SSI) that he claimed that these bloodstains cannot (i.e., impossible) come from the hair. Some people may have inferred that, but that claim is never made. So, Lavoie never attempt to prove that point, which would be very difficult to prove because, again, simple experiments show that it is possible.

But he also stated his preference for the Shroud to have been brought back to France, after 1311, by one of his ancestors, the wife of Gautier V de Brienne, and his son Gautier VI would have given it to Geoffroy de Charny. But there is no tradition or document to support that route, except the letter of Theodore Angelos discovered in 1981 by Pasquale Rinaldi, but whose authenticity has been questioned (e.g., Karlheinz Dietz, Andrea Nicolotti). We could think that Daniel Raffard de Brienne favored the theory of Othon because it would made his family as part of the story of the Shroud. But again, I believe that Othon de la Roche is a dead end for many reasons. As for the Templars to have been involved with the Shroud: it is largely based on suppositions, and I am afraid, another major misleading route. By the way, I am surprised that researchers proposing the Templars as owner of the Shroud have never (as far as I know) cited the translation of the relics from Constantinople to Paris as a probable path for the acquisition of the Shroud by the Templars. It is indeed related, in the story of the translation of the relics to Paris, that the Templars in Syria kept several relics deposited by Baudoin II in exchange for financial help. These relics were transferred to Paris after Saint Louis financially help Baudoin II. But the Templars could have extracted the Shroud from one of the reliquary, the Mandylion reliquary, so that an empty Mandylion reliquary arrived in Paris! That would be a nice story. But I do not believe it at all. But one thing that needs to be pointed out: the translation of the relics from Constantinople to Paris do not appear to have been studied by the researchers proposing the Templars as owning the Shroud, because they could base it on these documents. You can spend a lifetime researching misleading routes (because they never lead to a solid solution), so better avoid them, and instead follow the ones that appear most likely given the documents we have that are surely authentic. We have statements from the clerics of Lirey (Philippe VI gave the Shroud to Geoffroy de Charny), the statements made by the son and granddaughter of Geoffroy de Charny (son: a gift, granddaughter: acquired from war). These statements should not be contradicted unless solid reasons are given. In which occasion would Geoffroy de Charny receives the Shroud as a gift and due to his war services to king Philippe VI (and most probably from a relic taken from the Sainte Chapelle, documents: inventories of the Sainte Chapelle)?

When the Mandylion arrives at the Sainte Chapelle of Paris, it is not refer as a “sainte face”, and later inventories does not refer to the Mandylion as “a holy towel in a frame”. This is the other way around. The Mandylion is also referred by TWO distinctive descriptions in the early years of its arrival at the Sainte Chapelle: 1) In the Golden Bull (1247), it is a “holy towel in a frame or box”; 2) Saint Quentin (around 1245) describes it as “a board that touched the face of the Lord, when he was laid down from the cross”. So, one description refers to it using the word ‘cloth’ but with no image, the second does not use the word ‘cloth’ but with an image on the reliquary. Later inventories of the Sainte Chapelle confirm that there is a face of Christ painted on the bottom of the inside of the reliquary. But with NO cloth. Ever. There is no late inventories of the Sainte Chapelle that describes a cloth inside the reliquary of the Mandylion. The cloth is gone. I think we can see a simple explanation for the early description: the cloth could not be seen with an image because it was folded and the bottom of the reliquary stated what was supposed to be in it. So, by the time the Shroud is in Lirey or Chambéry, there is no cloth mentioned in the Mandylion reliquary from the inventories of the Sainte Chapelle.

Yet it is possible, for some official occasions, that the Shroud was shown folded such that only the face was visible. In any case, given all textual and iconographic evidences, what was the most likely location of the Shroud between 5xx 944? Edessa. And to complete about the possible confusion: ask some of your acquaintances if they think the Shroud of Turin shows a complete picture of a body or only a face. You will see that many (majority?) thinks that it is only a face. This is even true today after full complete photos of the Shroud have been in circulation for more than 80 years.

It’s a fact that there was a shroud of Christ in Constantinople from 958 at least.” From these two “sources” you conclude that the shroud in Jerusalem went directly to Constantinople. The shroud in Constantinople had an image on it. So we have two shrouds that according to you do not match that much. Where are your evidences of this “one good hypothesis” of #11? You accuse others of speculation… Did you mean the following instead: “we have a shroud in Jerusalem in 30 33 AD , we have a shroud in Constantinople in 7xx 958, and we have no evidence that they are related.”?

I think it would be more appropriate to ask the countess Diane Régina de Salverte, who lives in the Ray castle now and even better the librarian at the castle responsible of the archive (the « chartrier ») at the castle. I am in contact with the librarian, Jean Richardot, and I repeat what I already wrote on this blog. He confirmed to me that the word « suaire » does not even appear anywhere in the archive and that he does know any family tradition about the Shroud being at the castle. Absolutely no document at the castle or any oral tradition in the family confirms the presence of the Shroud at the castle according to him who knows very well the countess. The countess herself has actually no idea where this suppose tradition comes from. The story of Othon de la Roche is made up. It all comes from the story made up by Pierre Joseph Dunod in his 1714 manuscript kept in the archive at the Bibliothèque Municipale de Besançon. Then that story was published (in part) by François Ignace Dunod de Charnage (first publication) in 1750. Then Chamard, in 1902, repeats it. But all the references to support the claim of Othon de la Roche are distorted statements and false references. There is no true evidence of that story in the manuscript. Anybody who claims that the Othon de la Roche story is a possible scenario for the Shroud must first get acquainted with that manuscript of 1714. You wrote: “But if it’s authentic, someone had to bring it back, who better? Suggestions, anyone?” “It” refers to the Shroud? I suggest that the route of the Shroud from the East to the West is much simpler and documents that support it are still with us. The Shroud made its way during the translation of the relics from Constantinople to the Sainte Chapelle of Paris. See http://www.sindonology.org/sainte chapelle.shtml.

No modification should be done on the original image before attempting to generate a 3 D interpretation. Obviously, we can generate computer images that respond well to 3 D effect, but that’s irrelevant regarding the uniqueness of the Shroud. For example, on the production of the 3 D anaglyph on Shroud Scope (http://goo.gl/Bn3osf) there is no smoothing transformation applied.

I think I understand what you mean. The Shroud image appears to have been substantially smoothed, but that is a peripheral point. Interestingly, if an artist would have done the first image, he/she would have made a major blunder. The second image appears as the real correct one and here is the reason. The cloth is loosely draping the body. So, the cloth falls on each side of the head getting closer to the cheeks and the hair (top and sides). They should therefore appear closer, and they do on the second image. The way the cloth is draping the body must be taken into account, which the first image does not do. So, I would say that, at first approximation without going through a lot of precise measurements, the Shroud image appears as the real correct one. You wrote: “I have a great respect for your own paper “The Turin Shroud Was Not Flattened” which I think illustrates that human body measurements are not badly distorted if a sheet is assumed to be draped, more or less as flat as it could be, but left to settle under gravity, but you do not address the brightness/distance correlation in that paper, by which all points of contact would be equally bright, and the sides of the cheeks (for example) would appear as high as the bridge of the nose. I think you were thinking of undertaking such a study, but have not heard how it progressed.” Thanks for the compliment about my paper. This is correct, I do not address specifically the brightness/distance correlation in a precise manner because it requires more advanced techniques than what I presented in that paper. I could calculate the horizontal flattening of what was underneath the cloth with the technique used in that paper but not the vertical cloth/body distance in a very precise way. Yes, I am planning of undertaking such a study of measuring this distance given some real cloth draping over a body and also simulate image formation using different diffusing assumptions. A body and cloth could be computer simulated, this is one clear approach. Cloth simulation is very tricky and only recently has the simulation techniques improved enough to the point of physical reality. The advantage, of cloth simulation, is the possibility of a large number of essays and variations of cloth draping and observe the result of the image produced. Using a real body and cloth should be done also to compare it to the results of the simulations. I have done some 3 D scanning. This work is in progress.

First, for the sake of simplicity and historical accuracy, I would drop any reference to the VP8 in regard to the 3 D information in the Shroud image. The idea that the 3 D information embedded in the image of the Shroud was discovered by using the VP8 is wrong. Completely wrong. The image 3 D information of the Shroud image was described accurately way before the VP8 was used, at the turn of the X Xe century. It was described in 1900 1902 in the French and Italian press, books, and booklets. My understanding is that some writers like to refer to the VP8 as if the 3 D information in the Shroud is something mysterious that only a complex machine is needed to show it. And it allows these writers to through in the NASA or JPL acronyms as if that would give it a touch of scientific confirmation. (And additionally, we know the VP8 has nothing to do with NASA or JPL). But most of that has been said already by others, including on this blog and by Barrie Schwortz. Second, to say that concentric circles of various degree of colors create a 3 D image is quite wrong, simply because these circles are not 3 D objects. What is meant by a “3 D image” is that the objects are 3 D objects and they are correctly registered as #D objects in some way on a 2 D surface such as it is possible to reinterpret the 2 D surface as an accurate representation of the 3 D objects. Anything else is a false 3 D image, and you can create all kinds of these false 3 D images. Third, the Shroud image is not a photographic negative. I think this has been stated before many times but it is worth repeating. It is first and foremost an image that behaves as if it would have recorded a true 3 D human body by using variations of intensity of colors as perceived by the human eye. This aspect was described more than 100 years ago. Fourth, the Shroud image is “not unique” in that regard. This is obviously a wrong statement because there are million of such images and you create any such image at will. What is unique: all known painted images from the medieval age do not have such a characteristic. The subtlety of the 3 D information embedded in the facial area is beyond the capability of all known painters of the 14th century. That we can state with confidence.

The TS has 3 D encoded information based on some assumption: An anaglyph photograph has 3 D encoded information based on some assumption; an hologram has encoded 3 D information based some assumption; an auto cad file has 3 D encoded information based on some assumption; and so on. There is an encoder and a decoder, both used an assumed encoding of the 3 D information. Otherwise, no computer file would be able to encode 3 D information. You wrote: “A photographic image of the TS does NOT have any kind of relief encoded information”. This is false, because, assuming that the color intensity correspond to a relief, we can perceive a 3 D corpse that looks like a real corpse (granted with some distortion at some places). There is therefore 3 D encoded information in the TS. You wrote: “It’s simply a pattern of light versus dark that digital software such as Image J ‘interpret’ as relief, based on the darkest areas of a scorch or negative TS image being the highest, plotted on an imaginary z axis.” Yes, this is the assumed encoding. This is what 3 D encoded information means. You wrote: “I suppose one could use the term “encoding” loosely to indicate that some 2 D images derived from 3 D objects, like scorch imprints, do respond well to Image J etc, but it’s not a true encoding phenomenon.” It’s not a true encoding phenomenon? What does that mean? Encoding simply means that you assume some mapping, here from intensity to height. That’s all. Do you assume that when you look at a mountain that your brain has a not true encoding of the mountain? That is actually meaningless. Your brain interpret correctly what you see if indeed you perceive the object as it really is. So it is a true encoding, yet it is only electric wave certainly any true height in your brain.

Note that this is how historians and archeologists work: if an object does not correspond to the style of an artistic period, they do not claim that it belongs to that period. A painting that looks like a Picasso would not be ascribed a 16th century origin. Likewise, the Shroud technique of production and its style does not correspond to the 14th century. It actually does not correspond to any known artistic rendition of any period..","date":"2014-12-10","mins":"12:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/09/should-we-be-rethinking-the-vp8-and-3d-images/","cat":"3d","title":"Should we be rethinking the VP8 and 3D images?"},{"id":"comment-175407","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Hello Stan. Yes, the Shroud image appears, at first, like a photographic negative. But I would like to stress that a more precise description is needed because it is not a photographic negative. Granted that as a first approximation we could describe it that way, but I think it leads to many misunderstanding when you take this description literally. As a good example, take Walter C. Mc Crone who was told by Father Peter M. Rinaldi, in a series of letters they exchange, that the Shroud image was a photographic negative. This series of letters are reproduced in Mc Crone’s book (Judgment day for the Shroud of Turin). If you look up on p. 213 of that book, we can read the following (funny?) statements made by Mc Crone: “… also, if it is a perfect negative then Christ must have had blonde hair, blonde eyebrows, blonde beard and blonde mustache since these all appear light in the positive image produced as a photographic negative of the Shroud image”. Well, …, so Mc Crone took the expression “perfect negative” as literally meaning a photographic negative where light colors are reproduced as dark colors, and dark colors as light colors. But he knew that it was not the case, that is, that the Shroud recorded the distance cloth body (the rest of page 213 shows that he knew that). So, Mc Crone himself argued, and took the time do so, that the Shroud image was not a true negative and pointed out the error to Father Rinaldi. You could say it starts to be pedantic but others have done it also pointing out that this term is incorrect. So, I think we need precision to avoid confusion.

First. There is no need for AFM because there is no need to go at that level of details. Optical microscopy is sufficient and more appropriate. You know that (some) photocopiers use corona discharge to transfer ink to paper? When you look at a paper, say with a light microscope, printed with such photocopiers, how can you know if it was a corona discharge or some other techniques that was used to transfer the ink to the paper? It is not the atomic level that would reveal it but at a higher level, probably even by just looking at the paper with a magnifying glass. Why would AFM produce better results? What else do you want to learn from AFM? Second. The real issue is identifying on numerous fibrils either 1) their modifications or 2) if a colored coating exists on the fibrils that can be removed without breaking the fibrils. These two cases has not been clearly demonstrated. It is largely a problem of access to numerous fibrils coming from the image area. Theses two cases mentioned above can be produced by many physical phenomenon. Observing the effects may never lead to what exactly produced these effects but a class of possible phenomenon can be discarded.

I certainly find no harm in that, but it would also be an extreme position. 2) You wrote “like myself, had never even heard of those sedillis”. I am surprised. This is a common statement made by many writers of the time of Jesus and over many centuries. In fact, it is most likely that there was a sedillis on Jesus’s cross because Seneca, who is a contemporary of Jesus, describes the crucifixion (in general) and insists on the presence of the sedillis. Sedillis had many different forms, but is likely sharp, and more specifically described by Seneca as a “sharp pointed cross”. This might simply be a three point prongs as we see the effect on the Shroud. Granted, there will be two of these on Jesus’s cross. If the Shroud is authentic, these three stains we see on both butts appear to be caused by such sedillis. It is the most likely reason corresponding to historical facts. If the Shroud is not authentic, made by a forger, he/she happens to have created the most resembling wounds for such a sedillis. A coincidence? 3) You wrote “and doubt whether they were precisely as described by Mario anyway”. What are the doubts? The sedillis is described variously as a sharp seat, a horn, etc., and as “sharp pointed cross” by Seneca (again a contemporary of Jesus).

Did it indeed prolong death? As far as know, no contemporary of crucifixion practices described it for that purpose. This appears unlikely if the sedile creates even more pain and no respite can be obtained from it. You wrote “The gospel accounts all have Jesus dying within three hours of being crucufied, and Pilate expressed surprise that he had died so soon. This would argue against the use of the sedile” The opposite conclusion is reached if we assume that a sedile prolongs death. Pilate was surprised because he expected Jesus’s to live (suffer) longer.

Yes, it is the same paper that was presented at the 2005 Dallas conference. Indeed, I recently “published” it on academia.edu and I applied a redirect to academia.edu, if an attempt is made to access the paper from sindonology.org. Most of my papers (not about the Shroud) are listed (and some available) at Research Gate, my personal web page at SRI International or Université de Montréal. But I decided to give academia.edu a try. It takes time to transfer these papers due to copyrights. Second, Antero de Frias Moreira (and Daveb) mentions two important “puzzles” (questions): 1) How close is the cloth on the top of the head considering the absence of an image on the Shroud; 2) Lavoie’s theory that some bloodstains around the face originated from the face, and the not the hair. For question 1, I am fairly certain that there was a sufficient gap between the cloth and the top of the head such that we can apply the principle “distance >2cm => no image”. This can be tested by the following measurements: a) lay down flat on your back on a floor (that’s a real experiment), the back of your head touching the floor; b) place a finger at the intersection of the floor and the back of your head; c) measure the distance from that point on your head to your hairline going over the top of your head (or where you think the hairline should be if your hairline is receded); d) measure to the distance from the perceivable hairline on the Shroud to the point where the image abruptly stops on the back of the head on the Shroud (that is, close to the location of most bloodstains starts on the back of the head); e) compare the two last measurements. I get about 20.5 cm for (c) and 26 cm for (e). This measurement (e) was done on the Shroud Scope (http://goo.gl/Ndx L5d). There is a difference of 6 cm which is clearly enough to create a gap of more than 2 cm from the cloth to the top of the head. I would even say that there are other indications that the cloth slightly sag away from the top of the head, one of them being the fading bloodstains on the back of the head as you go up towards the top of the head. Of course, we expect the results to be different for different people, but this is confirmed for most people, it is the most likely correct conclusion. And if it happens only for a few percentage of people, it is a possibility. For the measurements you can do some variations, like tilting the head forward slightly (as it is presumed on the Shroud), but that will not change much your results. For question 2, I am fairly certain that the theory of Lavoie is incorrect (regarding the bloodstains near the face, not other bloodstains he studied). That is, the bloodstains perceived as coming from the hair on each side of the face, when looking at the Shroud, comes from the hair. This is actually one of the main conclusions of my paper: most of the cloth was not repositioned between the moments the bloodstains formed and the images formed (there are probably some part of the Shroud that was repositioned between these two moments but only the side of the body). Otherwise, you would have vertical misalignment of the bloodstains and the images. The way the bloodstains appear does not preclude that they come from the hair (and Lavoie never used arguments based on “the way the bloodstains” appear.) More precise studies could be done regarding the right principle to use about the distance cloth body: is it vertical, normal to the skin, or the shortest distance cloth body? To do so would require a more thorough simulation using 3 D technology and computer simulation. In any case, a 3 D simulation could make it much clearer all the possible small distortions perceived on the Shroud..","date":"2014-11-03","mins":"7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/02/paper-chase-a-significant-paper-by-mario-latendresse/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase:  A Significant Paper by Mario Latendresse"},{"id":"comment-89612","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"This is ME 02 from Evans’ collection.

I also think that the anaglyph is a very simple transformation of that data into a 3 D encoding that can be visually perceived. That very simple process leaves no doubt that 3 D data exist in the Shroud image. And there is no subjectivity involved as far as this process is completely independent of the Shroud and has been used to generate millions of other anaglyphs. Sorry to repeat this reference, but for a short presentation of how such 3 D data is encoded and an anaglyph version of the entire Shroud image can be generated, please see: http://sindonology.org/shroud Scope/shroud Scope Help.shtml#3 D. In a few words, the composite software simply (based on a linear transformation) shift horizontally, based on the luminosity of the pixels, some of the pixels of the Enrie photograph and then combined them with the original photograph using two different colors, one for the original image and a different color for the shifted pixels. It is therefore a very simple process that can be described by a simple linear transformation of pixel locations. It can’t get much simpler. The Shroud Scope has the full Enrie photograph transformed as an anaglyph where you can zoom in and out (back and front of the man of the Shroud). For example, please see (you will need color filtered glasses): http://www.dshroud.com/shroud Scope/shroud Scope.shtml?zl=3&image=7&lon=323&lat=1417 (Again, absolutely no artistic or subjective transformation was applied to generate that image, but only the transformation described in the previous reference was applied.) Notice the various details of the realistic 3 D image, for example the belly, the front feet where we have a perception of the tip (toes?) of the feet, and of course the various 3 D details of the face. The back is also quite interesting in terms of 3 D realistic representation. What is not complete clear yet, is the effect of the cloth wrapping the body versus this 3 D data. But what appears almost certain to me is that the image was formed while it loosely wrapped a 3 D form, and clues to that are numerous, such as parts of hair appears at the same level as the cheeks which means that the cloth was very closed to the hair when the image was formed. But a complete clarification of the relation of the wrapping vs the cloth body distance can be done by doing a computer simulation.

I thought this would fulfill that aspect in its most simplest form. Hopefully, it also give one clear recipe on how to generate a form of 3 D images using the Shroud image. As for the comparison between the various software generating these 3 D images, “regular” or not, I would rather focus on the reproducibility aspect. If someone using such a software cannot explain in an explicit matter how the 3 D image was generated, I would refrain from trusting these images. On that aspect, I think that the VP8 is good only as an historical reference and not as a reproducible experiment.

As a matter of fact, I think that removing the herringbone weave pattern increases the 3 D quality (for the Shroud). That does not mean that you cannot create very good 3 D effects based on the substrate (like pointillism). Although, this is a very different way of encoding 3 D data that can be perceived by the human brain. See for example the (almost unbelievable) autostrereograms at the following Web page http://www.pakin.org/~scott/stereograms/ Note that a particular procedure should be followed to perceive the 3 D effect of these images. This is explained in details at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram After some practice, it is an easy procedure to follow, but it is not natural at first because the eyes must cross to get the 3 D effects. In particular, try the minimalist 3 D image: There is indeed 3 D data encoded in that image, but obviously it is not based on the luminosity; it is based on the differential horizontal distances between the cents. When using the right procedure (without using any special glasses), one of your eye will pick up (focus on) some of the cents that are horizontally closer to their neighbors, and the other eye focuses on (most) other cents. You then perceive the smaller set of cents as elevated.

But he never reanalyzed the non image area sticky tapes. This is a clear faulty methodology: if he had given the same amount of scrutiny to the non image area tapes he could have found some iron oxide (red ocher).

He even contradicted himself and made a circular reasoning in the same paragraph (last paragraph on p. 92): he could now write that all sticky tapes that were in the image area have a significant amount of red ocher but at the same time saying that these four tapes had small amounts of red ocher.

That’s how you avoid going into a circle discussing imprecise hypotheses or claims. Essentially, I was pointing out that you seem to extend the meaning of “painting” and it is so, because the method you described above, which involves “a thick paste of iron oxide, water, egg white and sulphuric acid”, is not what most people would consider a painting. The technique is, ideally, intended not to leave any pigments. In any case, the fact is that Mc Crone tried to prove that it was a painting, and he failed. It is very unlikely that it is a painting for all the reasons already mentioned..","date":"2014-09-24","mins":"11:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/24/so-maybe-it-is-a-painting-after-all/","cat":"image_theory","title":"So Maybe it is a Painting After All"},{"id":"comment-155208","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Hugh, you wrote: “Mc Crone thought there were, and produced at least one experiment which appeared to demonstrate it.

That’s my point. I do not see how by citing Mc Crone’s work you support your assertion that a painting was not definitely ruled out. It appears that you are extending the meaning of painting or “definitely ruled out” or both. What does “definitely ruled out” mean to you? How do you define “a painting”? To state that the Shroud could be a painting you have to show that at least one form of painting makes it possible. Otherwise, you are stating that some unknown form of painting makes it possible that it is a painting, which is meaningless to me because it no longer gives any clear meaning to the word “painting”. Are you using a mechanical device not involving a painter? No brush or some brush? How do you define “your” painting medium? Let’s put it this way: I do not know any painting techniques that could have produced the Shroud.

Paper. First, he confirmed that the received date of the paper was in error: it was 27/10/2013 and not 24/02/2014, which now makes it possible that a review took place; second, that there was a review by two referees. One of the author of that paper has made public, on this blog, the name of one of the anonymous referees. I am not sure if this referee consented to have his name made public. Still, the more I read the paper the more I conclude that its main claim is not only unproven but is meaningless. The main claim of the paper I am referring to is given in the abstract: “In this paper we prove that a natural stochastic process can offer a rational and scientific explanation that can account for all the known properties of these bloodstains and body images.” There is clearly no such proof in the paper. The term “stochastic process” typically means that a probabilistic model of the physical process has been designed, using random variables and probability distributions. None of that appear in the paper. The paper is so confusing and contradictory that it is difficult to even pinpoint what they are trying to say. For example, in the last paragraph of section 2.4 we can read “Such damage on the fibrils, which depends on the intensity of the energy sources and their macroscopic effect (yellowing of fibrils), is purely probabilistic.”. What does “purely probabilistic” mean? That the probability has an uniform distribution? If so, than the image would appear has noise, not as an image of a man. In the Introduction we can read “For us, on the Shroud, there are latent body images (ventral and dorsal), yielded by the action of a stochastic process that is triggered by a little quantity of energy, without threshold to appear, with effects that have a time of latency of the order of many years. These effects are absent just when the energy is zero.” How much is “a little quantity of energy”? We get no clue whatsoever from the rest of paper. We read “without threshold to appear” what does that mean? “Energy zero”, but at room temperature the air has energy. Was the Shroud sealed in a vacuum at some point? And where is the discussion in the paper that relates a stochastic process and the creation of bloodstains? What is the “random” aspect of bloodstains?

Second, Fazio has been publishing the same rhetoric about this stochastic process in some other four (or probably even five or six) other published papers. I raise ethical issues on that point. Third, the presentation about this stochastic process does not make sense: there is no physical relationship between the energy level and a stochastic process.

It is the consequence of the distance of the cloth to the sides of the body. That is, from the assumption that the imprinted image has recorded the cloth/body distance, and the body is loosely covered by the cloth, the distance of the sides of the body are too far away to be recorded at all on the Shroud. This does not preclude the possible existence of a cap (Cahors?) to be on the head, but that would not be needed to explain the lack of image coming from the top of the head.

Obviously, if you see an elephant in a cloud, that cannot be an elephant and it cannot be an elephant that left its mark in the cloud. But if you see some inscriptions on the Shroud, how do we determine that it was intentional or related to a real object? You cannot eliminate these faint images as pareidolia unless you have the author of these images telling you so. The face on Mars, what was its probability to occur over a sample of images? I do not think it was close to zero, say, below 10^ 6. For example, DNA matching, it has to be very close to zero, such as 10^ 20, to be considered non accidental. There is a clear model to evaluate these probabilities (it has a simple model that works very well). This is what the probability has to be to be considered a non accidental image: pretty close to zero. You need a model to come to such an evaluation. We have no such model and it does not look simple to create such a model.

[1].” You have obviously chopped off the paragraph so that the reference to the work of Ercoline is no longer mentioned. So your claim that it has been “charmingly dismissed” looks more like you misquoted the paper. There is even another sentence (p. 13, second column, end of first paragraph) that reads: “This is con firmed by Ercoline et al. [1] for the Shroud (see also Jackson [4]): a statistical analysis shows that the body image of the Man of the Shroud, at hip level, is wider than normal by several centimeters.” So, a second reference is made to a paper that determined that there is observable widening at the hip level, but you squarely forgot to mention it. Moreover, you simply have not pointed out that simple fact: you report a measurement of 36 cm using the Shroud Scope at hip level (and you did not provide the image used, the zoom level nor the end points of this measurement, so there is no possible verification of where you did your measurement on the image) is quite close to the measurement of 36.6cm reported in the paper!

I have read many declarations that show basic misunderstanding. The most naive ones are of the form “This paper was peer reviewed, so its result should be accepted” (that one comes from a well known shroud authority). The review process greatly varies depending on the journal and the field of research. At first, there is no indication of the quality of a paper by simply stating that it was “peer reviewed”. It could be trash, it could be of the highest quality. For some journals, it might appear that they have a weak review process. But that could be a misleading first impression. At one extreme of the spectrum are journals that appear to have a weak peer review process: the author(s) suggest reviewers (the journal is not obligated to accept them), and pay to have it published. This is actually a common process in many fields: hundred of thousands of papers were published in Biology using that process. But it is an uncommon process in Computer Science. At first, this process is not bad: the suggested reviewers might be screened to make sure that they are respected researchers in the field and no apparent conflicts exist between these reviewers and the authors of the paper. For some journals, you always need to pay to have your paper published since this is their modus operandi (P Lo S ONE is one well known example for scientific papers). The cost of publishing is high and if you want your paper freely accessible that is one way to go: you pay the publisher so that the readers do not have to pay. Other journals do not charge a publication fee (they will charge the readers), but you can optionally pay to have your paper freely accessible on their Web site. The other extreme might be good or bad: the publisher do not charge any publication fee (they will charge the readers) and states that a peer review process is taking place. But you have some such journals that accept almost any paper as they run mostly as a business without much scientific supervision while still claiming a fair peer review process. The Web has unfortunately brought many new such journals. I have seen many papers being published on the Shroud in such journals (claimed as peer reviewed): their content was so empty of any new results that you had the feeling that the authors simply patched together random pieces of text from the Web. How do you know your way through all of this? I think you need to do some basic analysis: reading the instructions for authors, sampling some of the papers published, and verify the credentials of the editorial board. Also, as pointed out by Gabriel, the Impact Factor of the journal can help. This system is new and has been criticized, but a good Impact Factor (I would say above 3) is not a bad indicator (certainly when you reach an Impact Factor of 20, you know this is a very serious journal). But most importantly, every paper speaks for itself. There is nothing that replace a deep analysis of the results published, the methodology used, the cross referencing of every fact stated in the paper, and more.

That paper of Fanti and Maggiolo shows that the only place a superficial image could be detected is around the face. Even that claim about an image around the face is strongly challenged. Actually, in 2002, once the back cloth was removed, it was obvious that no image, for the frontal part, appears on the reverse side of the Shroud. So, to claim the opposite in that paper (jacksonpropp.pdf) is misleading. Also, the very axiom used to introduce that theory is wrong.

That quote is: “Common sense is the deposit of prejudice laid down in the mind before the age of eighteen.” This attribution to Einstein is “mostly false”, but not “false” (or should I say “completely false”). Einstein did not write or said that sentence. Therefore, it cannot be a quote attributed to Einstein. Yet, he could have thought that it was true, because Einstein wrote a preface to a book written by Lincoln Barnett who stated that quote. Did Einstein saw the quote? We do not know. That subtle point was discussed by http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/04/29/common sense/. Similarly, to state that the paper by Fanti and Maggiolo supports the prediction of a double superficially of the frontal image of the Shroud is mostly false, because there was no image found by them for the most part of the frontal image.

At 47:36 “he examined more than 8,000 fibers”. It is actually Christine Skirius (a junior high school student, back then) who looked at more than 8,000 fibers to count the colored (yellow) and uncolored ones [1, p. 101][2, p. 83]. But that analysis has a trivial result: there is more yellowed fibers in the image area than in the non image area. Actually, systematically going through the 32 tapes by Mc Crone to classify the sticky tapes was done in two days [1, p. 92]. It is also a bit disconcerting to hear at 34:24 “here’s Rinaldi with the Shroud”. It is not the Shroud but a copy of it on a cloth. Either Bernstein was careless in identifying what was on the photograph or he indeed thought it was the real Turin Shroud. I hope it is the former. But major, and fundamental issues, exist in this work of Mc Crone, obviously not stated by Bernstein. For example, in Table IV [1, p. 93] several sticky tapes are not classified properly, which can be determined by simply looking at the location of the tapes provided on p. 79. Tapes 1 HB, 2 AF, and 2 BF, classified as in image area but are not, and tapes 3 AB, 3 BB, and 4 CB classified as not in image when actually they are. The study is also completely biased because on p. 92 Mc Crone states that he restudied some tapes that he previously misclassified but without restudying others. And actually his classification correlates more with the presence of blood where the sticky tapes were taken then with the body image (yellow area). Mc Crone ignores that completely. But it was so obvious to check. Also, Bernstein misunderstand what Mc Crone stated about the formation of the body image: a forger is using a diluted paint barely visible when you apply it, then the fibrils would have yellowed to create the image. According to Mc Crone, the body image does not come from the red ochre as Bernstein states in this video but the yellowing of the fibrils due to the supposed collagen used. [1] Walter C.

It appears that you are putting on the same footing the Shroud of Besançon and the Shroud of Lirey, that is, we could conclude that the Shroud of Lirey were a painting if we use the same reasoning as Dorothy Crispino used for the Shroud of Besançon. Yet, Dorothy only covers part of the story. You really have to read the Bergier manuscript, and probably other documents. As far as I know, almost all historians have concluded that the Shroud of Besançon, as it was in the 18th century, was a painting. There are no doubts about it, whatever the Revolutionaries did (and I believe the stencil was really used in the 18th century). See also Palu Vignon and Dan Scavone.

There is no clear documentation that states that there was a Shroud in Besançon in the 15th century. You wrote “The Lier copy at least suggests that he got the Turin Shroud wrong – perhaps he got the Besançon one wrong too.” You used “he” twice in that sentence, but I can’t see who you are referring to with it. Chifflet? That can’t be since Chifflet has nothing to do with the Lier copy. Jean Jacques Chifflet (17th century) had direct access to the Shroud of Besançon but not the Shroud of Turin. So, he could describe precisely the Shroud of Besançon but not the Shroud of Turin. Bergier the same, he could describe precisely the Shroud of Besançon as one might assume that he could access it but does not appear to have access to the Shroud of Turin. Moreover, the first dissertation (not the one written by Bergier) of manuscript Ms 826 (17th century) describes in details the Shroud of Besançon and it appears as a painting as the image was seen on both sides of the cloth. Quite different to the Shroud of Turin. Bergier, if he really is the real author of the second dissertation of Ms 826, from all appearances did not have access to the Shroud of Turin and could not reliably evaluate its physical aspect and probably did not know what was claimed about its full history. In any case, Bergier relies his arguments on earlier documentations and the story about the existence of a Shroud of Besançon prior to the 16th century which he shows could not be the case. On the other hand, his first “preuve” (proof) would also discredit the Shroud of Turin because he claims that the Jewish custom of the first century was to use only strips of linen to embalm the body. Whether or not this is true for all cases is hard to tell. One interesting comment made by Bergier is the following: one long sheet would have been bought, then they (Nicodemus and Joseph) would have tear it apart to make strips of linen to wrap the body. But one can see that this would have taken much time, and they were out of time to embalm Jesus, they probably give up after creating one strip, which we still see today on the Shroud of Turin. Note: the first and second dissertations of Ms 826 are not written by the same author(s) and probably more than 30 (perhaps up to 70) years separate their writing. In summary, the story of the Besançon Shroud and the Shroud at Lirey are completely different. And this is based on many concrete documents we have today. As for a Shroud being considered genuine based on authority, this was probably true for the past but this is no longer true for today or when you have access to all the information that we have today for the past relics..","date":"2015-01-18","mins":"7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/17/ponderable-for-today/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Ponderable for Today"},{"id":"comment-184360","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Hugh, my posting just crossed yours. Sorry, I found ironic that you wrote “I can hardly refrain from recommending that Mario investigate Nicolas Sylvestre Bergier rather more carefully that he has so far.” I believe I have read it much more carefully than you did. The fundamental point that I believe you missed is that Chifflet and Bergier had full access to the Shroud of Besançon but not the Shroud of Turin. The description they give all look like a painting. Moreover, and that probably trumps almost all the discussion on the subject, the instigation of the creation of the Shroud of Besançon started in 1523 where it is stated that a shroud would be created for the theatrical play. The chapitre of Besançon wrote that. Did you read the description of the creation of the Shroud of Besançon in 1523? This is documented as an act of the church of Besançon. So, obviously, today, everybody agrees that the Shroud of Besançon in the 16th 18th centuries was a painting. Do you realize that this stated by all modern historians say and this is fully documented? Also, there is no documentation that says that the Shroud of Lirey was ever used in a theatrical play. That must be stated very clearly, which Charles Freeman does not state clearly (just to confuse people I guess). That sets it apart in a major manner. You have to at least starts with the documents that exist. As for Bergier stating that it must be strips of linen that must have been used, did you read the whole story?

I do not say that to end this discussion abruptly but to point out that this is getting out of the capacity of comments in a blog and these documents have to be entirely read to pick up all the nuances. 1) May I point out that Bergier does not put too much attention to the Shroud of Turin among many others. We can read in his dissertation: “Que tous ces saints suaires et d’autres encore soient authentiques ou non, peu m’importe. Je me borne ici à examiner celui de Besançon et je soutiens que l’empreinte qu’il porte est une marque évidente de sa fausseté, parce qu’elle est incroyable en elle même et impossible.” Bergier at this point does not even argue for authenticity or not of the Shroud of Turin. This is not of is concern. Moreover, again, he probably based most of his comments about the Shroud of Besançon on Chifflet’s description. So Chifflet should also be consulted for a description of the Shroud of Besançon. And the first dissertation of the MS 826 manuscript should also be read for such a description where its author clearly appears to have accessed to analyze and make many measurements on the Shroud of Besançon. 2) Charles, the side wound was painted on the wrong side on the Shroud of Besançon because the image was painted more prominently on one face of the cloth (yes, the image appeared on the recto and verso of the cloth as the paint went through the cloth (no gesso here!)), and on that face the side wound is on the wrong side. Besides, the very fact that the image appears recto and verso just points out to a painting. You have to read Chifflet (French), and Paul Vignon if you want to read an English text, but Vignon quotes Chifflet. 3) Charles, if the only reference is the badge of Lirey found in the seine to support the performance of a theatrical play at Lirey using the Shroud of Turin, this is not much. The documents does not point out to such a play but at a solemn display of the Shroud at Lirey.

In the realm of physical objects, we have to use a reasonable approach to “proof”. What is a proof in that case? I think it is reasonable that such a proof would entail to show that no one has been able to show the existence of a similar image or report that a similar one existed. And that has been proven, minus the description of the image of Edessa when it arrived in Constantinople in 944. Take another well known example: has it been proven that we have never observed a physical object going at a speed higher than the speed of light? It is reasonable to answer, yes. No such event has ever been reported. It is based on decades of experiment and research. It is hard to believe that a physicist would answer: “This has not been proven”. Stating that the Shroud image is unique, is correct and proven because no one has reported any other similar image (again minus other cases related to the image of Edessa). There is a major difference in stating: we just found this object, we believe it is unique as it looks odd, but we need to investigate further to look for more.

We have no historical witness or documents that state that an image (double, frontal or face only) was used in the Easter ceremony of the three Mary. On the contrary, we have a study made by Chifflet who mentions shrouds but none of which has an image on it. That is, a highly recognised historian of the 17th century denies the existence of an Easter ceremony (or any Church ceremony) of the 14th century or before with a shroud having an image. Moreover, the shroud of Lirey is never described to have been used in such a ceremony. There is only one shroud with an image (any image) attested in the 14th century or before being shown to a crowd: this is the Shroud at Lirey. The religious authorities at Troyes reasoned that such an image could not exist, claimed to be genuine or not. Therefore, why would any religious ceremony at a church in the 14th century or before used such an image? The Holy Shroud of Besançon was extremely popular for three centuries starting from the 16th century, and it was the only other shroud besides Lirey that had an image. And it clearly was a copy of the Shroud of Lirey. The claim that some other such shrouds (with an image) probably existed before the 14th century is against all known historical documents. Chifflet and all other historians could not state the existence of any. What Charles Freeman is doing is to avoid stating the reality of the historical documents to make some scenario historically sensible when in fact when you take into account the historical documents, these scenarios are proven to be highly implausible.

(That church no longer exists as it was destroyed to make place for the Vauban fortress.) He is writing in the 17th century. A shroud, or piece of cloth, was shown by one of the canons during that ceremony. This is according to Chifflet and this is before 1355. Yet, there is no image mentioned and Chifflet could not confirm any. And from the description, only one person was showing the piece of cloth. There is not a hint of an image on this cloth and the formal description of the ceremony that you describe above does not state an image. The Shroud of Besançon that would come later around 1520 is very different. We actually discussed that in January of this year. But you have not answered the question I asked: how do we know that there were hundreds of these ceremonies? Charles Freeman even claims to have references to painted cloth used in that ceremony. He has not provided any so far. This is my main question. What is clear to me: if there were hundreds of such ceremonies being held across Europe all of them appear not have shown any image. The very idea of the image on that cloth was so new to the clergy at Troyes that they rejected the authenticity of shroud of Lirey *solely* on that non existence. Of course, they knew absolutely nothing of the Mandylion. So, they would have fail to know anything about shrouds with an image being used in the Three Maries ceremony as it would weaken their argument. The lack of any documents and witnesses to such an image prior to 1355 strongly points to the uniqueness of the Lirey shroud, not the other way around as you tried to infer from totally unbalanced reasonings about the Mandylion vs the existence of images on the cloth used in the Three Maries ceremony. Again, please compare the two: we have no document or witness that states that images were on the cloth used in the Three Maries ceremony, yet you claim that some may have existed; on the other hand we have many documents that state that the Mandylion was not shown to the public and that it was kept hidden for centuries, yet you claim with certainty that the image that was on it would have been widely known.

So, I think you are not covering the latest historical finds. You wrote, “I would agree with Mario that searching these accounts for evidence of the authenticity of the Shroud is a dead end. Rather it provides evidence of the possible/ probable medieval liturgical origins of the Shroud.” Actually, this is not what I meant, but I can see now how the sentence I wrote could be interpreted that way. I meant the opposite, that is, that the search will likely not find any cloth with an image like the Shroud of Lirey (and also any image) used in a Three Maries ceremony (or any other ceremony actually). So, we can state: researchers convinced that the Shroud is inauthentic have tried to find a similar image on a cloth before it appears in Lirey, but none could be found. We certainly can now state something similar because many have searched already. You wrote: “I will also hope to give a reference from Hans Belting to the Image of Edessa being venerated by crowds who would sprinkle water on its eyes, one more reason why this was never the Shroud.

Or any church ceremonies. Often your references are also vague or does not point to the primary source. This is not the work of an historian. In general what you are doing is giving secondary references, and in several cases, misinterpreting them. For example, and this is on another subject that you introduced in your answer, the Image of Edessa, you cite Hans Belting. But the text you cite comes from the Narratio written shortly after 944. You appear unaware of it. And why do you cite this text about the ceremony of the Three Maries? Another example, you cite at (d) Abbé Bergier, who writes in French, and you write your own interpretation as “He goes on to note that in the Easter ceremonies, which he dates back to the 12th and 13th centuries, a linen cloth empreint de la figure de Jesus Christ enseveli (empreint, ‘printed’, enseveli, ‘buried’) is displayed to the congregation [ in other words he suggests that this was normal practice to have an image of the buried Christ]”. This is not case at all. Bergier writes that it was *possible* that such images was used prior to the appearances of shrouds such as Besançon, Turin and Lirey, but he has no references to backup this possibility that such shrouds/image existed in the 12th or 13th century. Bergier is writing in the 18th century, long after the events he is trying to describe. You are working with secondary sources *and* misinterpret them.

By the way, for over a century, the second dissertation (against the authenticity of the Shroud of Besançon) in the manuscript MS 826 of the municipal archives of Besançon was ascribed to him, but he was not the author of it (although I did think for a while that he was possibly the author). But Bergier had no more information than you and me about the whereabouts of the Shroud at Lirey before 1355. And the whole discussion is going into a circle if you are referring to the Shroud of Turin as a possible source of examples of cloths being used in a the ceremony of the Three Maries. The history of the Shroud of Lirey has been looked at so thoroughly! What is obvious is that Bergier is very vague and uses examples that we know very well today cannot correspond to what you are searching for. I think this is all very basic. You have to go back to primary sources to find what you are looking for. By the way, about the Narratio, and in particular the ceremony of the Image of Edessa, and whether or not the crowd could see the Image, see the work of Irma Karaulashvili, https://www.academia.edu/19780359/ Abgar Legend Text and Iconography. Kadmos Ilia State University 6 2014 164 240 On page 205: “On the fourth day of the middle week of the Lent the high priest went there, opened the chest in which the image was kept, wiped the icon with an unused sponge that was soaked with water, first gave the water that he squeezed out to the people then sprinkled the water over them. Ordinarily the chest with the image was kept behind the doors of the sacristy, which were opened on Wednesday and Friday. Everybody was able to see the chest from a distance but nobody was allowed to approach and touch It.” This is of course her translation of the Greek text of an excerpt of the Narratio. The image is in the Chest, but the crowd can only see the Chest on Wed and Fri (during Lent). The crowd does not see the Image at any moment.

She even think, like Averil Cameron, that the Mandylion was probably not even a cloth! The claim by many that the image of Edessa was clearly only a face is a myth. It is not clear.

IV. See a digital copy at Google Books: http://goo.gl/2n6 K Up. The quoted text, in French from a previous post, is missing an essential sentence. The relevant quoted text “C’est ce qui a fait dire à ceux qui ont donné l’histoire de l’un & de l’autre, que celui de Turin avoit servi à envelopper le corps tout ensanglanté à la descente de la croix, & que celui de Besançon avoit servi à l’ensevelir après qu’il eut été lavé et embaumé” essentially says that some people have the opinion that the Turin Shroud was used to wrap His body, entirely covered with blood, after it was taken down from the cross whereas the Besançon Shroud was used after He had been washed and embalmed. And, here is the missing sentence, Adrien Baillet adds his own analysis of this opinion by: “Ce qu’il y a d’incommode pour cette opinion, c’est que l’on a observé la même fixation (?) des membres dans l’une et l’autre peinture, jusqu’à lui croiser les mains et lui couvrir les reins de la même manière.” which essentially says that this opinion is mistaken because it was observed that both images are very similar: the legs and arms have the same position to the point of crossing the hands the same way. So, Adrien Baillet did not think that these two shrouds were different but that between the Turin and Besançon shrouds, one appeared to be a copy of the other. It corresponds to the current knowledge we have today about the (now gone) shroud of Besançon: it was a copy of the Turin Shroud. And we should add, that if such an opinion existed, it appears to be based on the fact that the shroud of Besançon did not show any prominent bloodstains whereas the Turin Shroud does..","date":"2014-11-27","mins":"11:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-173651","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Thanks Daveb for the pointer to Wilson’s book for this stained glass window.

According to a photograph of this small guide of the city, the representation of the Shroud has a front body image only (not a double image). Two bishops are holding the Shroud. I do not see how we could, without any doubt, connect this representation to the Shroud of Besançon and not to the Shroud kept at the time in Chambéry (Shroud of Turin) unless we assume that with a front body image only it should be the Shroud of Besançon. Yet, it has to be verified if this photograph is not truncating part of the representation of the stained glass window. Alain Hourseau in his book “Autour du Saint Suaire et de la collégiale de Lirey (Aube)”, p. 240, wrote that this stained glass of the Shroud at the Chapelle de Pérolles commemorates the ostentation of October 28, 1518, at the Castle of Chambéry, not the one in Besançon. But he also wrote that three bishops are holding the Shroud, although only two can be seen (again, assuming that the photograph above did not truncate the representation on the stained glass window). It is not clear how Hourseau came up with the date of October 28, 1518. My guess is that this date is based on the chronicle of Antonio de Beatis (http://goo.gl/p T Svnd), which relates the trip made by the Cardinal of d’Aragon in Germany and France, among other countries. The Cardinal arrives in Chambéry on October 28, 1518 (p. 208) and the Shroud his shown to them in the evening of that day. Beatis writes that they are being told that the Shroud is publicly shown only twice a year, on May 3 and on Good Friday, from an outside wall of the castle. It is therefore doubtful that this private showing of the Shroud, on October 28, at Chambéry, is related to that stained glass window representation. It could be based on the regular public showing at Chambéry. As for the copies of the Shroud of Besançon, many copies were made according to Jules Gauthier (http://goo.gl/8q Jb1i), some by Pierre d’Argent (p.9, first copy made in 1573, second in 1580, third in 1593). But d’Argent started to make unauthorized copies, and recognized in 1608 that they should not have been made. Some of these unauthorized copies were destroyed although many were not as they were sent to different countries. Only smaller copies, not real size, were allowed to be made without the authorization from the religious authorities of Besançon (the same policy applied today by the Turin authorities!). Jean de Loisy made his first copy in 1634. His younger brother Pierre took over after the death of Jean and got the exclusive right to reproduce the Shroud of Besançon in 1658. Pierre died around 1668, and his son Claude Joseph took over as copyist although he no longer had the exclusive right on producing copies, which greatly increased the reproduction of the Shroud of Besançon in various forms (e.g., medals). Therefore, from then on, copies could have been made by any artist of the time..","date":"2014-11-29","mins":"3:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-173897","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Thanks for the photo.

The Narratio explicitly states that twice a week “The image was beheld by all the congregation,” and you’re saying that it wasn’t?” Yes, the full analysis of the context let me conclude that the image was not directly visible by the crowd (i.e., congregation). The translation made by Guscin does not appear precise for that passage. Indeed, other translations are possible, and Nicolotti published another one, which essentially does not state that “The image was beheld by all the congregation”. See it in Nicolotti’s book, “From the Mandylion of Edessa to the Shroud of Turin”, p. 77. The pertinent text reads: “And since the ancient chest of the divine form was covered by shutters, so as not to be visible by all whenever they desired, on two days of the week, namely Wednesday and Friday, it could be seen by all the gathering crowd through very fine, studded irons — that among them were called “scepters” — when the windows were opened [ or: when the windows were pulled open by very fine, studded irons that among them were called “scepters”]; and everyone, with prayers, propitiated its incomprehensible power, although it was not permitted to anyone to approach, let alone to touch, the holy image with the lips or the eyes.” As you can see, in that translation the word “image” (or “form”) occurs at the beginning and end. Indeed, on this particular aspect, this translation corresponds to the Greek text. Guscin instead of using “it” used “image” in the segment “it could be seen”, but Guscin was over specific, because the text does not use the word “image” in that segment. The main point is: what does “it” refer to in the segment “it could be seen by all the gathering crowd[…]”? I think that the specific context of that text and the overall context of the description of the ritual at Edessa makes “it” refers to the chest, not the image. Nicolotti appears to also think that way, because on pages 78 79 (of his book) he argues mainly to prove that the bishop had seen the image on the cloth, but never argues that the crowd saw the image. I think that the Greek text has to be analysed carefully to understand this text and that also the general history of that text has to be understood to interpret it properly.

That’s one reason. At least one other historian have pointed out that the image of the face we can see on the cloth held in the Abgar Icon cannot be a direct pictorial representation, but that the face plays the role of a tag: it signals the presence of an image on the cloth that cannot be readily seen. This becomes clear once you consider that several of these faces appear to float over the cloth as if not being part of it (e.g., the wrinkles do not extend on the image) or the image extend beyond the boundary of the cloth.

And as far as it is known from documents available to us today, it was not shown in public with any visible image, not including the face. See in particular the paragraph: “It is doubtful that the Mandylion was folded in such a way that only the face of the image on it was visible, either inside or outside of its reliquary. It was folded in its reliquary with all the image hidden, and when shown in public it was most often in the same state because it was likely bound with a trellis to keep it folded. Some depictions of the face directly on the Mandylion were simply an informative method to remind the observer that an image existed on the cloth, not that it was directly visible. For example, this method would have been used in the depiction of Abgar V holding the Mandylion (see Figure 1).” And as discussed in several places in http://www.sindonology.org/sainte chapelle.shtml this conclusion is *based on the documents* describing the Mandylion reliquary and the cloth when it is sent and arrives at the Sainte Chapelle of Paris. This is not a supposition pulled from the imagination, but from descriptive historical texts and observations. You wrote: “But the facial image of Mandylion was publically displayed at least in 944 (and perhaps in 1032)! ” Which historical document states that the Mandylion’s face was shown publicly?

Constantine VII had a narrow face, and this is what is represented. The face on the cloth is not to scale and it is not even positioned parallel to the cloth edges.

Perhaps, you are thinking that the discussion on this blog about the “Narratio de Imagine Edessena” implies that the Mandylion was regularly taken out from its chest in Constantinople. This is not the case because that particular text under discussion refers to the processions of the Mandylion in Edessa, not Constantinople. Furthermore, in the text you cited, “Symeon Metaphrastes recites that, upon the arrival of the Mandylion in Constantinople, “everyone was looking at the marvelous image of the Son of God on the holy cloth … “, the “everyone” does not refer to the masses at Constantinople, but rather of the people at a private viewing of the Mandylion where the two sons of Romanos, Constantine VII, and some other officials are present. Some historians even consider that this text is metaphorical because it refers to the inability of the sons of Romanos to distinguish important features of the face. But in any case, only a few people are present at that viewing. The procession that occurs at Constantinople in 944 does not state that the Mandylion was shown to the population. It was carried around the city, and it does not imply that it was shown.

Stating otherwise would be idiotic. By definition, a bloodstain is due to contact with blood! Nowhere in my paper do I state that bloodstains are not due to contact. So, I do not understand why you are stating otherwise. On the contrary, my paper says that the bloodstains prove that the Shroud cannot have undergone a complete loosening or flattening during image formation after being in contact with the blood on the corpse, since that would create major incorrect vertical alignments of the bloodstains vs the images. That’s the main point. All the details are in the paper. There are many other points which you are quite wrong in the interpretation of Lavoie’s published work. For example, Lavoie never used the argument that the blood cannot come from the hair due to a lack of pressure. Indeed such an argument would be expected, but he did not use it. Can you provide a quote from Lavoie’s papers (Shroud Spectrum or the Frascati conference), on the subject of the bloodstains around the face, that states that you need a significant amount of pressure to transfer the blood from the hair to the cloth? In essence, Lavoie does not prove that the bloodstains cannot come from the hair, he proves that they can come from the face. This is quite different. But to do so, he does not analyze the problem of the vertical alignments of the bloodstains vs the images and at the end has to rely on a supernatural flattening of the Shroud to “explain” the phenomenon because indeed it no longer makes geometrical sense..","date":"2013-01-03","mins":"10:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England"},{"id":"comment-21584","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"To continue my answer to comment #11, you wrote “you really seemed to favored some supernatural process to explain the image”. I think this is a contradiction of terms. I do not see how you can “explain” a phenomenon by relying on a supernatural process. By definition, a supernatural process has no explanation attach to it, since if you had an explanation of that process it could not be called “supernatural”. In any case, I will try to explain what I think of Shroud research. Essentially, the artifacts (images, bloodstains, water stains, etc.) found on the Shroud can be studied in very precise terms. And you can formulate some possible explanations about their formation. You could say for example: “this image is created by the deformation of the linen fibrils”, or “this image is created by biochemical reaction X on compounds Y and Z found on top of the linen fibrils”, or “it is possible, by using a laser of frequency X at energy level Y to modify the linen fibrils as found on the Shroud”. But in all cases it may not be possible to state more precisely how these phenomenon did happen in the context of the Shroud covering a corpse in a tomb. All scientific theories have limits in their power to explain and predict. It is true for General Relativity (it does not work at the nuclear level), for the Big Bang theory (where does the energy of the Big Bang comes from?), evolution (how did the first bacteria originated, was DNA or RNA from out of space?), and so on. This is going to be the same for the Shroud and its images. Late in his life, when Rogers worked on formulating a theory to explain the images on the Shroud, he relied on the Maillard reaction. This was for a good reason since the coloration of the impurities he found on the fibrils were similar to the products of a Maillard reaction and such a reaction could occur at low temperature given enough time. On the other hand, he was aware of the limitation of that theory since it was difficult to explain how to form precise images based on heat convection. This is the limit of that theory. It explains some observations, but not some others. We could simply say “the color observed on the fibrils is very similar to the color we would find if a Maillard reaction occurred on the impurities that were detected”. And that’s quite interesting in itself. But some other researchers are not so convinced that there is not a better explanation. They try other experiments to show that other type of physical phenomenon could create a similar color on fibrils. This is research: You try different routes so that you might actually go as far as possible in covering the observations. In some cases, these experiments are done to simply show that the coloring is possible despite what some other researchers have written. I think this is the case of Di Lazzaro and his colleagues at ENEA: I think Rogers stated that a laser could not produce such a coloring without destroying the fibrils. They wanted to show otherwise. And I think they succeeded for that specific goal. (Of course, the media got into it and turned things around completely, creating a huge confusion.) In the case of Giulio Fanti, his corona discharge experiments were also to show that a similar coloring is possible. This is research. But to remain coherent, we also have to admit that the phenomenon and circumstances that created the Shroud images are quite unique and probably very difficult to reproduce, if reproducible. This is so since we essentially have only one (recorded) such shroud in the history of mankind. If the phenomenon we are proposing occurs frequently, then it is suspicious that this phenomenon is the right one since we should have more shrouds like the Shroud of Turin. On the other hand if we propose an experiment that we cannot (ethically or otherwise) reproduce, that cannot be useful. That’s the dichotomy of the Shroud. In essence, Shroud research is quite uncharacteristic compared to many other fields since you have to find some phenomenon that cannot happen on a regular basis but also that you could reproduce. I hope my answer was not too convoluted! And I hope to see real research around the Shroud, not continuous bickering and personal attacks..","date":"2013-01-04","mins":"3:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England"},{"id":"comment-21517","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Was a pun on the word pity intended?

If you see four doubled layers, you have eight layers. This is what Wilson was explaining. And it gives the correct dimension to only see the face of the Shroud. For example, the expression “To be paid back four fold” does not mean that four operations of repaying is done, it means that the amount paid back is four times the initial amount. You could do this by any number of payments from one to whatever number: 100 payments, …, three payments, two payments or just one. The process is not important, the final result is.

The tri in “tri fold brochure” applies to the final state of the paper not the process of creating that brochure. Likewise, the Greek word tetrarch refers to the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province, not to a country that would have been divided four times (which may represent a very small division of a country depending on how you applied these four divisions). Charles, have you looked up the Liddell and Scott Greek lexicon and spotted a word with the prefix “tetra” that would describe a process done four times and not represent the final state of that object?

Honestly, I think you are misreading Wilson’s description. Yes, he describes a process to REACH the final state, but this is to illustrate one of the possible process (and I think there are more appropriate ones, in particular regarding the protection of the image). The final state is the major point in his description. Certainly, it would have been instructive in Wilson’s book to show the side of the shroud to see the EIGHT layers. As I just mentioned there are many such possible folding in eight layers and there are some in particular that would be such that the entire image is not visible to protect it AND at the same time could easily converted to look like the Madylion without ever seeing most of the rest of the image.

First we read: “The Relics of St. Louis of France. In 1238 the French King Louis IX, the future Saint Louis, paid a ransom to the Venetians for the passion relics that were taken from Constantinople and that were then in Venice. On 10 August 1239, the king, followed by a great procession of mounted knights and a parade of brilliantly decked out citizens, welcomed more that twenty relics in Villeneuve l’Archevêque. Among the relics was a cloth said to have a facial image of Jesus, the Mandylion.” But in 1239 only the crown of thorns arrives in Paris. The Mandylion, arrives either in 1241 or 1242 in Paris. As a matter of fact, the 22 relics arrive in France by three different translations. And, at no point in the documents of the Sainte Chapelle known to us, or the formal document ceding the relics to saint Louis, do we read that it was observed that there was a facial image on a cloth as part of these relics. It is more subtle than that. Second, and most importantly, that document (i.e., A Critical…) keep repeating what many others have written without analyzing the documents of the Sainte Chapelle by declaring that the cloth received as part of the relics was destroyed at the French Revolution. All documents of the late inventories of the Sainte Chapelle mention an image at the bottom of the reliquary, not on the cloth. The cloth that was in that reliquary most likely disappeared much before the French Revolution.

He made up fanciful stories about other historical facts. He is totally unreliable. Of course, he also wrote fanciful statements about the Shroud of Turin to discredit it.

As I already wrote, we have to confirm T3, it might have been a copy done before T1, which then would prove that it cannot depend on T1. But until it is dated, we have to be careful declaring genuine, be cause we know that what is being written in T1 is fanciful. As for T2, the only confirmation we have is that the coffer was presented as such in the 20th century. Researchers who say that it is a tradition of the Ray family that this coffer was used to transport the Shroud cannot give any reference. Is it a statement from the current owner of the castle? Who in the Ray family says so? The current owner cannot confirm anything and the current librarian cannot confirm anything either. The archives of the castle could be searched, but currently the coffer is a very weak element. By whom? We do not know. For what purpose?

It says nothing what this cloth (if there was actually any inside, which is not certain) was, less it was a Shroud.” “sanctam toellam tabulae insertam” means “a holy cloth inserted in a table”. So, I do not see on which basis you write “if there was actually any inside, which is not certain”. So, according to you the text is not clear that there is a cloth inserted in a table? Now, if you look at all inventories of the Grande Châsse, this “table” is the reliquary described as a box with the known dimension well described by inventory R. This identification can be done by a simple one to one correspondence of all relics and reliquaries described in the Grande Châsse with the relics listed in the Golden Bull. “And still you have to think out how the Shroud allegedly disappeared unnoticed from the reliquary inside well guarded Sainte Chapelle. This sounds ridiculous.” This is not ridiculous at all. I think you are not aware of some essential and well known historical facts about the Sainte Chapelle, the relics, and what the King of France could do with these relics. The King of France had absolute control of the relics of the Grande Châsse, he considered these his own possession. This is extremely well attested historically. He could give parts of relics to whoever he wanted without the permission of anybody else and without reporting it to the clerics of the Sainte Chapelle, if he wanted it to be so. This is well known. “Finally, the clerics could not analyzed the relics without the permission of the King because he kept all the ten keys to open up the doors of the Grande Châsse[p. 17, Troche, 1855]. This was the case until the fire of 1630, which is after the time the Mandylion had apparently disappeared from its reliquary.” The King could take any part of a relic and gave it to whoever he wanted, if the need was there and the clerics would not notice for a while. As a matter of fact, you can see the confusion occurring at inventory L where they can no longer clearly find the content of the Mandylion reliquary. Something really strange occur during this inventory. It is even possible that the clerics did not look inside the reliquary for a very long time (many decades), because there was no need to do so. The inside of the reliquary of the Mandylion has never been described by anybody besides the clerics and they did so very rarely are far as we know. There is no known exposition of the inside of the Mandylion reliquary when it was at the Sainte Chapelle. Not one.

It is also conceivable scenario.” No this scenario is not conceivable. The author of MS 826 was desperate to find any documentation that would have supported his claim. If he had gotten from the descendants of Otto any information in favor of his thesis (the Shroud of Besançon is authentic) he would surely have done so. Don’t you think?

Then, count the number of true supporting facts and the distortion he is presenting about many of these facts. That source is totally unreliable.

It most likely is a 18th – 19th century copy, which could have been put there in the 20th century. So the set up appears as an idea of previous owners who heard of the story propagated by T1. When was the coffer put in the castle? Currently nobody knows with precision, but again, the current owner has no idea and there is no one piece of family tradition that shows that it was there for a very long time. No document from the archive. Sorry, I keep repeating it: all current knowledge about the coffer points to a modern (probably 20th century, perhaps 19th century) addition. You ask: “Do you believe that the coffer was deliberately installed (or labelled as used to transport the Shroud) by some conspirators to back the claim that Otto once had the Shroud?” It is not a “conspirator”. The placement of the coffer did not occur at the same time that the MS 826 was written. Again we have no reliable source in the family archive stating when the coffer was labelled as such. It is conceivable that it is one of the owner of the Ray castle who probably started to believe in the story of T1 and guessed that this could be the coffer used. And again: How do you explain the transfer from Othon to Lirey? All transfers that I am aware of contradict reliable statements made by the son and grand daughter of Geoffroy de Charny. On the other hand, the Shroud going through the Sainte Chapelle have none of these difficulties with extremely reliable documents: inventories of the Sainte Chapelle having a strong pedigree. And strongly reliable historical events (the transfer of the relics from Constantinople). It is a world apart from such scenario as Othon de la Roche. As for T3, it shows up recently (1981). That is what I meant about T3 being much later than T1. So, it appears suspect considering that T1 is a made up story. What is the age of this copy (letter to Innocent III)? We do not know. It could be modern. A close study of it should be done..","date":"2015-10-30","mins":"11:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/27/its-the-curmudgeon-in-me/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"It’s the Curmudgeon in Me"},{"id":"comment-213947","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"O.K. “Do you believe in two corresponding forgeries in two obscure documents from about 18th century 1000 miles away from each other?” I have answered that already.

The letter to innocent III: it needs to be analyzed more deeply and dated. But the existence of T1 which makes up the story about Othon is enough to put major doubts in that story. Again: the coffer at Ray castle is far from a proof. The person that probably knows the most about it is the librarian at the castle.

It states that a cloth was in the reliquary. That document was written in 1247, six years after the reliquary of the Mandylion was received in Paris, and given directly by Baudoin II to Louis IX and the clerics.

In your document, you also point out the theory that the Shroud came to France with Othon de la Roche, and consider it to be very reliable. But this is very unlikely. This is one of the theory that is repeated by many, but without looking in details at the original documents. It lacks any reliable foundation. It becomes quite clear when you can read all the French documents, in particular the manuscript 826 of the Bibliothèque de Besançon, related to that theory. This is the source of that theory. I wrote a book in French on the subject of the Shroud of Besançon (see amazon.com or my website) with a transcription of the manuscript. In a few words: that theory exists purely on repeating false statements made in the 18th century but rekindled recently (1981) by a copy of a supposed letter to pope Innocent III dated 1205. The authenticity of that letter is questionable.

Yes, I believe so, because these events are known to us as having happened in sequence. T1 occurred, then T2, then T3.

Seneca the Younger (4 BC – 65 AD, philosopher, statesman, dramatist) describes the sedillis as “acuta sedere cruce” that can be translated as “a sharp chair on the cross”. Seneca also describes it as “acuta crux … subdas” (Epistles), that is a sharp cross placed underneath the victim. He also writes (translation) “Do you think it’s so great to weigh down on one’s own wound and hang down from the Patibulum, stretched out while spread abroad?”. Based on this, Yannicks’ statement that the sedile could not in any way cause wounds on the butts is flat wrong. What we see on the Shroud is likely the sign of a sedile that was not mentioned in the literature in its full details, yet is close to the description of Seneca as “a sharp chair” or “sharp cross …underneath”. Sharp indeed! 2) The paper by Miller and Pellicori does not give a definitive answer about the origin of the stains under consideration. On page 79 of their paper we read: “Two small circular stains at C 7 and D 7 are mirror images and visually resemble weak scorches. In fluorescence these stains are absorbing. Note also lighter boundary areas associate with water marks.” In the Section “Discussion — Laboratory experiments” on page 84 in the context of the fluorescence photographs we can read: “Laboratory data for whole blood displayed total absorption, which is in agreement with the Shroud data” This is also summarized in Table I on page 75: “Blood, UV Fluorescent Characteristics: Highly absorbing. No color. Fluorescing borders apparent around some areas.” From these facts, you certainly cannot conclude from the fluorescent photographs that these stains under consideration are not blood stains. Miller and Pellicori data just says that it is blood. But I actually disagree that fluorescence photographs is the last word on this. It is possible that the Turin authorities have a microphotograph of these stains and that we could see, from white reflective light (i.e., no fluorescent photography), that blood is clearly involved in these stains. 3) Yannick constructed a convoluted scenario for the origin of these stains as scorch marks, totally detached from any historical event. The scenario concocted by Yannick is so improbable that almost anything else could be imagined. The stains cannot happen while the Shroud was folded due to the backside color intensities that do not match. Miller and Pellicori, of course, did not have access to the backside of the Shroud and could not see that the hypothesis of mirror scorch marks was not plausible. And Ron (commenting in this blog) pointed out a clear fact: if someone had put water on these stains, it was done with great precision, contrary to what we would expect for someone hastily trying to extinguish whatever was burning the Shroud. That by itself is not a plausible assumption. To conclude: I think that all the data that we have at the moment point to a detail that I would place at the level of the nails through the wrists versus through the palms: these are bloodstains from wounds caused by a sharp sedillis. It is (very) likely that we have yet again a clear sign that shows forgery is not a plausible hypothesis for the Shroud..","date":"2012-01-31","mins":"2:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/29/quote-for-today-by-mario-latendresse/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for today by Mario Latendresse"}],"resources":[{"id":"comment-169457","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Hugh, you wrote “[…] contemporary accounts go on and on about how fresh the bloodstains are, in particular, and how clearly the image is depicted, which, if they are to be taken at face value, simply cannot correspond with the image as we see it today.” But have you ever seen the Shroud at one of the Ostensions in Turin?

Charles, with all respect, you are not writing with precision. You wrote such a sentence as “Only when we have all the depictions can we begin to make a final assessment.” Notice that this sentence says “we”, then “begin” and then “make a final assessment”. That means that you have made no final assessment on the points you mentioned (e.g., loincloth, the Shroud lost paints so that the crow of thorns is no longer visible, and more). Right or not? But, you did write, in your History Today article, definite statements about the disappearance, on the Shroud, of various images (e.g., loincloth). Right or not? Perhaps, what you are saying is that that you are suggesting these possibilities. But your article does not say that at all, it states that these are proven. You wrote “What does it matter if there was a loincloth added or not?” I point out the loincloth because you mention it extensively in your article of an image that would have been painted over on the Shroud and then disappeared (erase or not intentionally). You made definite statements about these, but there is absolutely no proof of these statements. Do you understand that? No proof? This repeated suggestion, I insist on “suggestion”, that major amount of paint (or gesso) disappeared from the Shroud is speculation. There is no physical proof of that. Simply look at high definition photos of the Shroud and the photomicrographs. You are aware that they are readily accessible on the web, see for example the following http://goo.gl/93 Pp7t. You have many such photomicrographs available and none show any gesso or paint left. Then you have the simple observation that for 400 years there was a backing cloth for the Shroud (so that backing cloth was there during the last 4 centuries covering the period these images would have disappeared according to you), removed in 2002. Did we find any substantial amount of paint in the backing cloth? No. Therefore, any statement saying that major amount of paint disappear from the Shroud has to be explained. How did it happen? Take another example of statement without proof you made in your article (still related to the loincloth): “I have explained how Carlo Borromeo (and/or Francesco Lamberti) had insisted that the nakedness of the man on the Shroud should be painted over with a loincloth.” Note the word “insisted”.

Can you explain how such quantification could be done? Your hypothesis that gesso was used on the Shroud is as mysterious as the entire Shroud story itself. It would take a miracle to have this gesso disappear without obvious visible traces on the Shroud. As you know, gesso is glue like. It is used to fill the interstices between the threads. Also, a backing cloth was present without interruption for 400 years attached to the Shroud. It was removed in 2002 and no visible such material was found on the backing cloth, which should have received some of it if some add detached from the Shroud.

It contradicts the notion that it can only covers the outer fibrils of the threads. Again, the fibrils between the threads are not even damaged or colored in most places when looking at the photomicrographs. Simply look at the photomicropraphs. You cannot ignored them. “Once the surface of the Shroud came under pressure , the gesso would have fallen outwards not inwards.” For centuries, the Shroud was folded or rolled, so the image surface was inside the cloth. It was not kept flat for centuries. “As you will know STURP specifically said that they had not examined any medieval linen paintings so they had nothing to go on. This was an extraordinary omission. If they had bothered to do some basic research on painted linens before they set out to Turin they would have been in a much stronger position to make credible claims about painting.” This is irrelevant: we have scientific data, photomicrographs, and more from STURP and from other sources.

I don’ t know of any Shroudies with the relevant expertise in so many areas of research I am interested in.” I do not know which professor you are referring to.

But we have no other examples to compare to! He assumes that things should appear in a certain way as he expects them. But this is a circular reasoning: If you say “I expect that the image coming from a dead body would look like X” but cannot provide other examples of such image formation then you are assuming your conclusion. Here are the list of supposed qualities we should see if Christ had left his image on a shroud: 1) “A cloth laid on a body would pick up its contours, but there is no sign of this.” So we know that a body that leaves an image MUST do that? Charles has an example to show? 2) “Then again the heads do not meet, suggesting that this was not a cloth that was ever folded over an actual head.” Well, that’s not a problem since the contours are not shown. Charles did not see that observation 1 implies 2. There is no top of head shown (no contour), therefore the “two heads” should not touch. May be the artist was a bit more clever than Charles realized. The “artist” was completely consistent. And then the list of presumed “errors”, if the Shroud had an image coming from a real body, but without supporting these claims with any measurements: 1) “Again, the hair of the body would have fallen back if the figure had been lying down but the blood is as if it is trickling down the hair of a standing figure.” Well, what about somebody who had been standing up while being beaten: would the blood flow down, side ways, or up? Down appears to be the case. And did Charles note that the hair is away from the face as depicted on the Shroud, which is consistent with the fact that the cloth reached the hair as the cloth goes down towards the ground: the gap is proportional to the vertical distance from the cheek to the hair. The gap is consistent with the hair being lower than the cheek. 2) “If you lie on the ground and place your elbows in the same position as those on the back image of the Shroud, you can quickly see that it is impossible to hold the position of the crossed arms in the front.” Sorry, I cannot quickly see that. Any measurements that could be given to prove that point? 3) “There is a difference of seven centimetres between the lengths of the two bodies.” Is it “lengths of the two bodies” or the lengths of the two images such that no consideration is given about the cloth placement, the feet not completely visible and so on? Where are the measurements? I guess this is too complicated to give? Yes, it is complicated. So simply stating some differences in lengths of images prove nothing. Nobody has provided the measurements to support such claim that “the lengths of the two bodies” differ by seven centimeters. And none are given by Charles, so it is unproven..","date":"2014-10-18","mins":"5:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"id":"comment-31123","author":"mario_latendresse","post":"Andrea, you replied “I am speaking about linen textiles.

You wrote “Meanwhile the shrine at Cadouin was on the way to Compostela and was packed out with pilgrims on their way there.” We are talking of pilgrims at the exposition of the Shroud of Cadouin, not yearly pilgrims at Cadouin on their way to Compostela. Any approximate numbers to support your claim about the popularity of the Shroud of Cadouin? Which periods are you referring to in terms of centuries? For the Shroud of Cadouin, you have a summary of the expositions provided at http://www.amisdecadouin.com/le saint suaire de cadouin/ with references. Between 1392 and 1455, the shroud of Cadouin is not exposed in Cadouin but in Toulouse. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the number of pilgrims to the expositions is going down to the point that there were no expositions between 1797 and 1866. In 1866, when the pilgrimage was reinstated, the number of pilgrims at Cadouin was estimated at 6000. After that it appears to go down (in the 1920s there is small procession in the city) until it is stopped in 1932 because it was found to be clearly inauthentic. This is the only number I have seen published and it is quite inferior to the number of pilgrims to the Shroud of Besançon, estimated at several ten of thousands at some point. Cadouin was a very small town compared to Besançon. Cadouin, today has a population of about 400, Besançon above 110,000.

But my aim is definitely not to make you upset. I think my approach is fair in the following way. Yes, I learned late December 2014 that the manuscript 826 is available online from the Memoire Vive website. We had some exchanges of details about your upcoming publication and I learned that you were about to publish a book about that manuscript. Clearly, the book was not yet published back then. Of course, I had no access to the transcription you have done but I was aware that you transcribed it, yet, had not been published. I knew the book was about to be made available late February or early March. I did not know you paid for having that manuscript scanned. The Memoire Vive website have some (light) copyright claim on that scanned. I contacted them about the possibility of using a reproduction of one page of that manuscript in my book, and their answer was that it was free to do so as long as I mentioned the provenance of that image. But, it turned out that I decided not to use that image in my book. How much did it cost to have it scanned? I am even ready to pay you part of it. Yes, your book has 194 pages. So I expect, given your expertise and time taken to work on it, deep comments in your book. I trust your expertise and I am very eager to read your book about that manuscript. In my book I state that your book is about to be published. On my website (www.sindonology.org)) I do the same. I even just added a link to your page on Academia to the order form of your book. I am promoting your book! When I use the term “not published yet” for that manuscript (more precisely the first dissertation of that manuscript), it means that no clear printed version of the manuscript was available to the public. I think this is a fair definition. What I want to make clear to any reader of my book, is that I transcribed the first dissertation of that manuscript myself and not based on any other transcription. This is restated on the description on the back page of my book, and inside of the book. This is the main aim of stating “version inédite” and states that the transcription was never published before. It is true that you transcribed it before me, and you can definitely claim so, but it was not published when I transcribed it in my book. I think this is a fair description. The main aim is that this transcription should become available in an book form for everybody to read. This is my aim. And it will be at a very affordable cost. I hope you understand my point of view. And again, if you paid for the scanned, I am ready to pay for a part of it. I have not stolen any idea or information that you have provided. I used that information, yes, and I cite its provenance in my book when it is relevant. Andrea, please, do not be upset!

First, you keep repeating a lie : I sent you a message to academia.edu to further discuss the manuscript which you never responded. Second, you are very upset (furious as you wrote) about my statement of stating that my work was not based on any further transcription. This is what I wrote in my book. I state that the transcription is “inédite” and I further explain that it was not published before so that the transcription of the first dissertation is totally based on a transcription I did directly from the manuscript put online. Of course, all due references are made to that manuscript online. Third, you keep writing that you paid to have the manuscript scanned. But Memoire Vive claims total copyright of these scanned images. I contacted them and they never mentioned you as having paid or help paid for the scanning of that manuscript. So, Memoire Vive does not record or state that you have any right on that online, so you should not behave as if there is some restriction, beyond the legal ownership of Memoire Vive, to use that online document. Fourth, you have not read my book yet and keep making many suppositions about its content. It has commentaries about the manuscript. Probably not as much as you wrote, but hopefully put in the write context. I do not comment on your book because I have not read it yet. Fifth, you never mentioned in the presentation of your book that the second dissertation of that manuscript has been published before. Twice actually. I am clear about that right up front (from the back page of my book) and the description of my book so that the reader is aware of that part of the manuscript is already available somewhere. I think the presentation of your book is misleading on that matter. Sixth, I did modernize the French language of both dissertations for reasons explained in the book. But a scholar can still refer to the online manuscript because every folio is referenced in my transcription. I even intend to make an ebook version where the reader can click a link and see the corresponding scanned image on Memoire Vive of the transcription in my book. Besides, this is 18th century French, not medieval, so the original French text is not that far from modern French. Finally, I repeat partly what I have already written to you : you can claim to have first transcribed completely the manuscript. I am not claiming that, that would be a foolish claim. Many people may have transcribed it before and that we are not aware of it. This is not so important anyway. I think you are making a huge fuss about that.

See paper http://sindonology.org/papers/latendresse2005a.pdf There is no need for a tight wrapping to explain the bloodstains in the facial area: Lavoie did not present any argument that such bloodstains cannot have been transferred from the hair and I do not see how such an argument can be made.

See for example the water stains photomicrographs at http://www.sindonology.org/photomicrographs.shtml There is even some large areas darkened by water that appears to have carry charred linen. Yes, I agree that a water stain moves microscopic materials by capillarity and that it could make some part “cleaner”, but the other case also occurs (move dirt from one part to another) and they do occur on the Shroud. The main issue on the Shroud is that water has moved some of the charred material onto the cloth over the image. Moon’s paper never states that the image was removed or dissolved by water. I do not see that anywhere in the paper. What is clearly stated, at least twice, is that the water stains obscure the image and in some cases from carbon (charred material) that drifted from the burned area. I agree to that. Take one of the elbow, for example: it is obscured by a water stain. But I disagree that the front feet were more visible before 1534, because the current image of the front feet is compatible with the toes of one foot pointing upward such that you could not see the side of the toes and most of the foot. And, as pointed out by others, the artistic rendering of the Lier copy cannot be taken to support the claim that the foot was once more visible because the artist may have added the appearance of the front feet to its copy. And note that Pam Moon was careful to write that the artist could have added that detail.

Dr Jackson’s “fall through theory” through a mechanically transparent body also requires some tautness in the cloth for a high resolution photograph affect therefore 2 positions. You have not mentioned the 2 position theory so you must not accept it. It is necessary for both theories of radiation image formation fall through or hovering. This is all conjecture but working backward from the facts of the image in all its totality of characteristics, it is my opinion that the hovering is the most plausible of all theories and the “fall through” second. [..]Where is the contradiction now?[..]It is what I call the “best guess” theory. ” With all due respect to Dame Piczek, Dr. Lavoie, and Dr. Jackson: these theories are highly speculative for no reason whatsoever. Dame Piczek has never presented any measurements or well founded geometric argument to support her “tightly taut” theory. She uses her artistic intuition to support this theory. Is artistry the way to approach such a complex subject? Dr. Lavoie made many interesting observations about the bloodstains in relation to the image. But there are major contradictions as part of them based on simple geometric reasoning regarding the two position cloth theories (in a few words, the two position cloth theories imply that there would be incoherence between the bloodstains and the image due to the vertical shift, a point on which Dr. Lavoie has never addressed because he focused on the hotizontal shift.). Dr. Jackson theory of the the cloth falling through a “mechanically transparent body” has no numerical foundation. You have to look for the simplest explanation possible that explains the facts (Remember Einstein’s statement here, the modern statement of Ocam’s razor principle).

(On this matter, I am not the only one thinking so, see http://www.questia.com/library/p3647/history today/i3061873/vol 56 no 7 july) I have not seen the final version of your article, but there are currently no references to many statements you made about the image of the Shroud. They are indeed misleading (e.g., the two bodies front and back have different lengths) and unsupported. I do not expect the reviewers of this magazine to analyze such statements. This is a major shortcoming. And, you have been dodging these questions on this blog. Where are your references for the statements about the “impossibilities” of the image of the Shroud? Where are the measurements? What theory of image formation are you basing your statement that the contour of the body MUST appear? If it were a research paper, you would have taken the time to support these statements, but not having done so, you may now realize that they cannot be supported by any evidence or measurements.
