He always wraps his LEFT arm tightly around my shoulder after weekly Communion at Mass.\nI had always felt Jesus’ physical presence within and beside me since I received my First Communion at age 7.   I don’t know of other Catholics who have this experience after receiving Eucharist.\nI’m 64 and a devout Catholic.  \nI feel I’m truly blessed in Jesus revealing one of His very personal traits to me since my childhood.\nSincerely,\nJoanne Nirtaut\n\n","date":"October 25, 2011 at 12:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2008/10/02/was-jesus-left-handed-as-evidenced-by-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"history","title":"Was Jesus Left-Handed as evidenced by the Shroud of Turin?"}]}
