On that subject, there are 2 things that make me think like this:  1- At that time (3th or 4th century A.D.) in Rome, the most common figure of God was a man with long hair and long beard (like Zeus and other great divine figures), so it is highly probable that those pagan depictions of God have been used to represent Christ at a time when no one knew what he looked like (which make me think the Shroud was still well hidden somewhere at that time).  And 2- There is not one of these bearded Christ frescos that show as many points of congruence as we found in most Pantocrator-like icons, which make me think the first depictions (the Roman frescos) were not based on the image we see on the Shroud, while it is the contrary for the Pantocrator-like icons.","date":"February 8, 2014 at 9:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/06/touching-on-the-byzantine-legend-that-jesus-had-a-shorter-leg-and-therefore-was-lame/","cat":"art","title":"Touching on the Byzantine legend that Jesus had a shorter leg and therefore was lame"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"No matter what the author of the Acts of Thaddeus must have had in mind when he used the term “tetradiplon” in his text, this cannot have been a “subtle” way for him to talk about a long burial shroud of more than 4 meters long folded in 8 parts for the very simple reason that was already underlined months ago by M. Freeman, i.e. that in a later part of the same manuscript, the author make a specific mention of the burial cloths that were found in the empty tomb and it’s evident that, for him (as well as for St John Damascene and various eye-witnesses who saw the Mandylion in the Pharos Chapel in Constantinople and for all the Byzantine artists who saw the Mandylion), those burial cloths had nothing to do with the “tetradiplon” cloth he mentioned earlier in his text and that was used by Jesus to wash his face, thus producing a miraculous imprint on the cloth.

I read your interesting paper last evening and I was very surprised to note that you did not addressed any of Adler’s findings and conclusions versus the C14 dating of 88…  Is it because Adler never officially linked his findings with the idea of an invisible reweaving?  In the end, never mind the reason, I think it is a mistake on your part to have completely ignore Adler’s findings and conclusions regarding the C14 corner because it is a fact that he was the very first to scientifically challenge the C14 dating results with any kind of credibility by analysing some threads that came from the area where the C14 sample had been taken.  Also, you must know that his findings were often used by the defenders of the invisible reweaving hypothesis to back-up their conclusions…Sub-question:  Is it possible that, based on Rogers and Adler’s findings, there could have been a strong contamination of the C14 zone, without being related to a possible invisible reweaving?  In other words, would it be possible to build a different hypothesis that would be based on those findings in order to explain a possible 1300 years shift in the dating result?  In the end, is it possible that the C14 corner was highly contaminated (so much that it would have shifted the result from the first to the 13th Century) and that such a high contamination came from something else than a invisible reweaving?Finally, it’s also interesting to note that your own highly suspicious conclusion concerning the reweaving hypothesis is pretty much the same as the one that was draw in 2009 by Pierre de Riedmatten, who is the president of the Montre-nous ton visage association in France.

Another person (I prefer to not mention his name) who wrote this infamous paper (a paper by the way that had one goal: to try to back-up the hypotheses of Fanti and DiLazzaro – 2 of the co-authors of the paper – about the image formation) once told me personally that Fanti never even wanted to mention Rogers’ very possible hypothesis concerning the chromophore in this paper and that all he wanted to mention was his personal hypothesis regarding the primary cell wall of the linen fiber!!!

I can’t find them, but Colin seems to refer to one by ‘Charles A Rogers’, so maybe they are? They’ll no doubt turn up on Shroud.com eventually.Secondly – from what I can gather of its website, the entire organisation of the the Pasco conference was predicated on two premises – one might almost call them axioms – that the Shroud is the authentic grave-cloth of Christ, and that the image was formed by a miraculous process. There was little or no consideration given to the possibility that either of these might be incorrect, and piles of evidence listed in favour of them without any reference to the fact that almost all of it has been, and still is, disputed or rejected by other researchers.Thirdly – to specific points raised by James Bond here.a) I don’t think it is true to say that “The 14C carbon dating group went into the investigation already determining in their minds that the TS is a fake”. There is little evidence at all for that, and quite a lot to suggest the reverse. One or two of the Oxford team were avowed atheists, but that’s not the same as wanting the Shroud to be a fake. And this: “tossing data that didn’t agree with their preconception of the age” is wholly untrue and without any evidence at all. And later this: “The Arizona data was thrown out because their data was too far outside what they considered the norm to be and just use the other two labs’ data.” This is utterly untrue. Wherever did you get that idea from? I don’t believe that even the most ardent authenticist could have said that – you must have misunderstood.b) This ‘bottom line’ “the image is not a painting or any other medium used to produce a very faint image” is precisely one of those axioms which is hotly disputed. This: “that has to be viewed from a distance to even see any discernible image and the closer you get the image just disappears” is no truer for the shroud than for any other image. Shroud 2.0 is an iPad app which allows you to investigate the Shroud in huge detail, and distinct features are discernible from a few inches away.“whereas in a painting or photograph the image becomes more distinct the closer you get.” Not at all. It depends very much on the size and style of the painting or the resolution of the photograph. It is very wrong to compare the Shroud’s style to a conventional portrait. Try looking at, say, one of Monet’s waterlily paintings in close up and see if you can guess what it is! “The only reason you can see anything now is that the image is produced with a higher contrast” This is true of most photographs, especially the Enrie ones of 1938. However I have seen the Shroud ‘live’ at the last ostentation, and the image was perfectly visible. c) “All the attempts at copying and trying to reproduce a similar image has failed because paint or some other medium is used not a radiation burn such as is on the cloth.” This is another highly disputable ‘axiom’. It stems from the disagreement between Walter McCrone, who claimed to see iron oxide particles on the cloth whose density corresponded to the intensity of the image, and John Heller & Alan Adler, who found almost no iron oxide, and did not attribute what they did find to paint. It is insufficiently realised, especially by those who do not want to realise it, that McCrone was examining whole areas of tape, covered with all the debris lifted from the Shroud, including all the pigment particles, whereas Heller and Adler were examining individual fibres extracted from the sticky tape, which had to be washed thoroughly to remove the gum, thereby removing all the paint particles they were subsequently unable to find. It is also not sufficiently realised that the X-Ray Fluorescence study of the Shroud carried out in Turin by STuRP’s Morris, Schwalbe and London clearly showed a direct correlation between image intensity and iron concentration.d) Next, I’m afraid, is a recitation of another set of axioms, usually touted by authenticists as indisputable facts, but none of which is any such thing.i) The Shroud has some characteristics of a photographic ‘negative’, rather like a wood-engraving, or a bas-relief rubbing. It is not a true photographic negative unless we assume that Jesus had very blond hair and beard, and that his nose was much lighter in colour than his cheeks.ii) All images contain 3D-information of one kind or another. When the Shroud is subjected to a computer program which converts intensity to height (such as imageJ or the infamous VP-8) it looks like a bas relief emerging from a flat base. It does not look like a fully three-dimensional body. It only works at all if one makes several assumptions, disputed even among authenticists: the shroud must have been horizontal, the ‘radiation’ must have been vertical and rapidly attenuated in air, and all the different materials of the body (hair, skin, lips, etc.) radiated in exactly the same way.iii) Anybody who rubs an old fibre-tipped pen over a fairly dense cloth will find he makes an image with all the characteristics specified – minimum penetration, no capillarity, only the uppermost surfaces of the threads discoloured, etc.iiii) It does seem to be true that at least one component of the image, and probably an important one, is a discolouration of the flax fibres themselves, such as caused by a scorch. There is some research being carried out, not least by Colin and myself, as to how these ‘scorches’ can be formed. The two broad avenues are by heat (or radiation), and chemically, such as by acid. Various possibilities were available to medieval artists. However, all attempts to derive such discolouration ‘naturally’ from a dead body seem to have been abandoned in favour of  supernatural approach, although a few authenticists still hope that some kind of vaporograph effect, or geological piezo-electric effect, are also possible explanations.v) “The conclusion is that an artist or forger could not have produced the bizarre characteristics of the images in any era, either ancient or modern.” That is only the conclusion of those who do not even acknowledge that any research into non-supernatural explanations is still being carried out.vi) On the Shroud the bloodstains from the nail-holes are only visible on the back of one hand. Of course they do not show holes in the palms. They are exit wounds. They are, however, consistent with the conventional idea of where the nails went in, although there are several medieval images which are exceptions to the rule. “Where all religious paintings bar none have the nail holes in the hands.” Not quite, there are exceptions.e) Your last comment: “It surely begs the question as to why. No artist has come forth claiming that he/she did it all during the MA era – you would think that one would. There’s no signature on the linen as to who the artist is whereas all painting from that time forward always has the artist’s name or logo or something.” I don’t know where you get that idea from, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. Throughout the Middle Ages individual artists were very rarely recognised, especially ecclesiastical ones. The decoration of a church or palace was largely up to unsung, unrecognised, and now completely unknown ‘craftsmen’ who did a range of things from sculpture to embroidery. Some of the most impressive are now known as by “the Master of…” a place or painting, without any idea of his name. The Shroud was not made for permanent public display, but as part of something else, a ritual, a pilgrimage, a play, or similar, and as such its artist would not have been considered a particularly distinguishable individual. And if, of course, it was made deliberately to be mistaken for the original thing, then of course it wouldn’t be signed!","date":"July 26, 2017 at 1:31 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/shroud-scope-8-372-impossible-scourge-marks-surely-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood","title":"Shroud Scope 8: 372 impossible scourge marks (surely?) on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"I really thought we could have an adult debate about this; me understanding where you’re coming from and where my ideas lay but what I’ve received lately is just ridicule.

A lot of it had to do with chemistry and the mathematics.If I had one sticking point it would be image formation and how it could have been done by folks in the MA. The image is not a pigment of any sort nor is there carbonation of the fibers which are microns thick (or thin however you want to look at them) and the discoloration is on the surface of the fibers.The image is barely discernible (again bringing that up) when viewed up close (in fact disappears) and can only be seen from a distance. At the conference they had a replica(?) of the image as it is without contrast enhancement and you simply cannot see it clearly; get close to it like eight inches and the image just becomes a smudge, nothing there.The presenters on Saturday brought up subjects as:Image Formation On The Shroud by Giulio FantiChemistry Of The Image Imprinting Process by Jose Carlos GodinezNaturalistic Processes For Image Formation by Mark AntonacciRole Of Information And Radiation In Image Formation by Bob RuckerThese plus other papers were presented in an all day seminar on Saturday. By the time 9pm rolled around my brain was like tapioca.There was another presentation by Russ Breault titled: CIS Jerusalem which was more on the theological.If you would like, I have an extra copy of the International Conference on The Shroud of Turin I could send to you. It has all the details of what papers were presented and by whom so if you wanted you could research those presenters.Regards,James“How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?Sherlock Holmes The Sign of the Four, ch. 6 (1890)","date":"July 27, 2017 at 11:58 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/shroud-scope-8-372-impossible-scourge-marks-surely-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"blood","title":"Shroud Scope 8: 372 impossible scourge marks (surely?) on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Well you had me going there for a minute.

Those “theories” simply do not fit with the whole picture given by the data collected by STURP and some other reliable researchers.  We must look elsewhere for a proper answer and this “elsewhere” MUST be related with a natural phenomenon most probably in direct link with the biological state of the Shroud man’s corpse during the time he was enveloped into that cloth (no more than 48 hours).  I’m affraid there is no other viable road to follow if someone really want to find truth regarding the image formation.  Rogers knew this and he was one of the first to really try some lab testings to check out his Maillard reaction and the truth his this:  HE SUCCEED to reproduce the kind of coloration we see in the image area on the Shroud with a linen sample prepared the old fashion way and some release of ammoniac gas, which is truly interesting (see his book for details). Of course, he did not succeed to reproduce an image with all the characteristics of the Shroud but this was a great  step in the right direction.  Other researchers should follow Rogers’ footsteps and verify his ideas about the image formation more deeply.  If someone would do this properly, I think we could have some nice (at least to some people) surprise!  Note: One thing I wonder about the result of coloration obtained by Rogers is if his colored sample made of linen was showing a discontinous distribution in the colored area. There’s nothing about this important aspect of the question in his book…  But since Rogers presented this result as being a good match with the image area on the Shroud, I have to guess it was the case.

And for those who are unable to put their hand on it, here’s the most relevant part concerning the subject of the spectal characteristics of the Shroud’s bloodstains (emphasis are mine):“An X-Ray fluorescence investigation (note: a study published in 1980 by Morris, Schwalbe and London of STURP) was carried out on the Shroud to complement the X-radiographic study (note: a study published in 1980 by Mottern, London and Morris of STURP). The blood marks show an element distribution CONSISTENT WITH A BLOOD CLOT EXUDATE, including an iron value elevated over the cloth background value, but no evidence for the presence of mercury or any of the trace elements associated with the mineral forms of iron oxides. This observation SUPPORTS BLOOD MARKS IDENTIFICATION AS BLOOD DERIVED, BUT DOES NOT SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL THAT THE BLOOD MARKS ARE PAINTED MINERAL MIXTURES OF IRON OXIDE AND MERCURIC SULFIDE (VERMILLON). This is IN AGEEEMENT WITH THE CHEMICAL AND X-RADIOGRAPHIC CONCLUSIONS (note: that the bloodstains are really made of real human blood material). An independent scanning electron microprobe study (note: a study published in 1981 by Baima Bollone, Jorio and Massaro in Italy) compared one of the blood particles with a control sample of human blood and found AN EXCELLENT MATCH, FURTHER SUPPORTING THESE CONCLUSIONS.Ultraviolet and visible reflectance studies were carried out on the Shroud and also some fluorescence spectroscopy (note: both studies published in 1980; one by Pellicori and the other by Gilbert and Gilbert of STURP). In general, these observations COMPLEMENTED THOSE SEEN IN THE FLUORESCENCE PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDY (note: a study published in 1981 by Miller and Pellicori of STURP). The reflectance spectra of the blood marks from the whole cloth and also a near UV-visible microspectrophotometric study of blood particles from the sticky tapes (note: a study published in 1980 by Heller and Adler of STURP) are CONSISTENT WITH THE SPECTRA EXPECTED FOR A TRAUMATIC BLOOD CLOT EXUDATE. In a more recent study (note: a study published in 1998 by Adler, Selzer and DeBlase), transmission UV-visible spectra of a simulacrum of a TRAUMATIC CLOT EXUDATE prepared from laboratory chemicals MATCHES THESE OBSERVED SHROUD SPECTRA, but the simulacrum of a mineral pigment “blood” composed of iron oxide, mercuric sulfide and gelatin IS A COMPLETE MISMATCH. This CONFIRMS THE PREVIOUS CHEMICAL AND FORENSIC CONCLUSIONS. It is of interest to note that the position of the near UV PEAK FOR ALBUMIN BOUND BILIRUBIN IS INDICATIVE OF THE TYPE OF SPECIES FROM WHICH THE BLOOD ORIGINATES AND IN THESE OBSERVED SPECTRA IS CONSISTENT WITH A PRIMATE ORIGIN (note: see Heller and Adler’s paper published for STURP in 1981 and entitled “A Chemical Investigation of the Shroud of Turin”), IN AGREEMENT WITH THE IMMUNOLOGICAL STUDIES IDENTIFYING A HUMAN SOURCE FOR THE BLOOD MARKS (note: Adler probably refers here to the studies performed by Baima Bollone in Italy).An infrared reflectance examination of the Shroud accompanied the thermographic study (note: a study published in 1980 by Accetta and Baumgart of STURP). Although these spectra were of low resolution, some high and low frequency peaks typical of amide absorptions associated with proteins could be detected in the blood mark spectra, but not in those of the body images. THESE RESULTS WERE CONFIRMED AND EXTENDED in a more recent high resolution microspectrophotometric FTIR investigation of fibers and particles extracted from the STURP sticky tapes (note: a study published in 1996 by Adler). Again, protein amide bands were ONLY OBSERVED IN THE BLOOD PARTICLES AND THE SERUM COATED FIBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLOOD MARKS. Utilizing the spectral analysis capabilities of the computer program accompanying this instrument, which allows one to add or subtract standard spectra of a known molecule to the observed spectrum, testing its presence, IT WAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE OBSERVED SPECTRA OF THE BLOOD PARTICLES CONTAINED BOTH METHEMOGLOBIN AND ALBUMIN BOUND BILIRUBIN (note: this strongly suggest that the bloodstains on the Shroud comes from someone who was in a highly traumatic state at the time he shed is blood). INFRARED SPECTRA OF THE TRAUMATIC BLOOD CLOT SIMULACRUM CITED ABOVE AGREED WITH THAT OF THE OBSERVED BLOOD PARTICLE SAMPLES (note: he talks about the blood particles coming from a bloodstained area on the Shroud), BUT THE MINERAL PIGMENT SIMULACRUM DID NOT. These results AGAIN CONFIRM THE CHEMICAL AND FORENSIC CONCLUSIONS AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE BLOOD MARKS ARE NOT PAINTINGS.”Now, after having read this part of Adler’s paper, which was written shortly before the death of this true expert in the chemistry of blood, if you still unsure about the fact that the bloodstains on the Shroud are really made of real human blood and, more precisely, of blood clot exudates coming from an highly tortured man, I don’t know what it will take to convince you! In my mind, this is the strongest fact coming from the whole investigation performed by STURP (and also by Baima Bollone in a completely independent mode)! Yes, the chemical, physical and spectral characteristics of the bloodstains on the Shroud are showing some noticeable differences with normal bloodstains made of liquid blood coming from someone who was not tortured for several hours prior to death (whether it be the chemical composition, the visible color, the spectral characteristics, etc.) AND IT’S TOTALLY NORMAL THAT IT IS THAT WAY SINCE THE BLOOD ON THE SHROUD IS MAINLY COMPOSED OF EXUDATES OF BLOOD CLOT SHED BY A MAN WHO WAS IN A HIGHLY TRAUMATIC STATE PRIOR TO DEATH!  This is what can explain the differences versus normal ancient bloodstains that was noticed by other people over the years.  I don’t have anything else to say on the subject, except for the fact that this very strong scientific fact coming from the blood is the most solid piece of evidence that support the authenticity of the Shroud as a real burial cloth and, not only that, but as the authentic burial cloth of none other than Jesus of Nazareth! Also, it confirms the principal conclusion of STURP, i.e. that the body image on the cloth must have come from an interaction (supernatural or, more probably, natural) between the burial cloth and the dead and crucified body that was present in it for less than 48 hours. Now, if people don’t want to see what is as evident as the nose in anyone’s face, what can we do?","date":"October 31, 2013 at 8:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/28/of-those-big-meaning-words-superficial-half-tone-and-striated/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Of those big-meaning words: Superficial, half-tone and striated"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Quote: “Fanti and his friends have found that very intense, very short bursts of laser light can do the trick.”Comment: Yes, BUT ONLY for the superficial nature of the image.

For all these reasons, it is highly probable that most if not every bloodstains (except the post-mortem blood that could have been released by the open wounds during the transfer of the body to the tomb and after the enshrouding) had enough time to clot to a certain level before they came in contact with the cloth.

And the best radiation expert of STURP (Rogers) tells me that a burst of energetic radiation of any kind or a scorch is unable to produce all the characteristics of the body image on the Shroud mainly because such processes are releasing too much energy (in other words, they are too strong) and this conclusion has been fully confirmed by two independent experts in radiation from Italy named Fazio and Mandaglio (both nuclear physicists). I don’t know for you, but for me, having a brain that work all right and a pretty good judgment, when I hear such conclusions from true experts that were independently confirmed by other true experts, I have a strong tendency to LISTEN and to ACCEPT THEM. And once you do this, you have to come to this conclusion: The Shroud is a real burial shroud that has contain for less than 48 hours the tortured and crucified body of a man who look like the Jesus of the Gospel and in all logic, the body image on the cloth CANNOT have been caused by the hands of a forger, no more than any burst of radiation coming from the dead body (which is, by the way, scientifically impossible). In this context, anyone with a brain who accept these confirmed conclusions of true experts about the Shroud would come, like me, to this final conclusion: a natural and probably biological process (or a series of processes like that) related to an interaction between the dead body and the surface of the cloth must be responsible for the body image on the cloth!  That’s my line of thinking and if someone don’t want at all cost the Shroud to be the product of a forger or the by-product of the Resurrection of Christ, he will surely come to the same conclusion as mine.

If you listen carefully what the true experts who analyzed the blood and the image on the Shroud had to say, that’s the conclusion you should reach.

In my mind, there is only one hypothesis that have been proposed so far to explain this and it’s the one of Rogers involving a thin layer of impurities that would be located at the top surface of the cloth.  But the only problem with Rogers’ hypothesis for the image chromophore versus any image formation hypothesis involving a burst of high energetic radiation like a burst of light is the fact that, as Rogers wrote, it’s almost impossible for such a source of high energy to be able to color only the layer of impurities without also affecting the underlying fiber (thus causing a deeper color penetration, especially in areas where the source of energy is in direct-contact with the cloth). In order to have a real proof that such a hypothesis would work at fiber level, you would need to have a linen cloth covered with a thin layer of carbohydrate impurities and make two tests of coloration: one with the source of energy located in direct-contact with the cloth and another with the source of energy (which would be of the same exact intensity as the first test) located at 3 cm or so and microscopically prove that, IN BOTH CASES, only the thin layer of impurities has been colored without the production of any noticeable defects anywhere in the structure of the underlying fibers and with no more color penetration for the test done with the source of energy located in direct-contact with the cloth than the other test done with the source of energy located away from the cloth…  Good luck!","date":"January 26, 2014 at 7:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/24/radiation-man-a-new-bsts-article/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Radiation Man:  A New BSTS Article"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Question for Hugh:  How can you apply “photosensitive chemicals” so that only the first fibers on the top surface of the cloth will be covered by them?

Effectively, if you only produced direct-contact scorches, the 3D rendering of your image should look like valleys and plateau instead of showing a real 3D.  In fact, all you address was the color penetration inside one single fiber, but I did not find anything regarding the ability of your process to restrict the production of colored fibers to just one, maybe two fibers deep into the cloth and no more than this, no matter if the source of heat is located in direct-contact with the cloth or at 3 or 4 cm away from it.  And be sure that no matter what you can think or write about that, in order to convince me, you would need to show me microscopic photos to back you up.  I say: good luck my friend!  Note:  there are PCW able to get colored more easily than the inner part of the linen fibers EVERYWHERE inside the cloth and not just on the top surface of the cloth.  I seriously doubt that you could achieve the feat of being able to restrict your color penetration to one single fiber on the top surface of the cloth… And even if you would be somehow able to do so, it would only be with one of the two set-up I talked about (direct-contact and 3-4 cm location from the source of heat) and never with both…2- Concerning the production of color at a distance from the cloth, you wrote: “…PCW may become discoloured in affected threads (note that there are PCW everywhere inside any thread, and not just on the top surface of the thread) even with a small air gap (BUT NOT EXCESSIVE – MILIMETRES RATHER THAN CENTIMETRES).  I’m sorry Colin, but this DO NOT MATCH the results of Jackson et al. from STURP who specifically wrote that the image formation process was able to color any given thread up to a distance of 3.7 cm.

I don’t say that the images of plants produced by a Volckringer pattern effect are showing exactly the same characteristics as the image on the Shroud but it is possible that the Shroud image can have been the result of a similar biological and chemical interaction (very complex obviously) between the dead body and the cloth, which would have acted both by direct contact and by a molecular diffusion at a very short distance (close proximity if you will).In other words, the fact that there are images of biological things that are showing the same kind of good resolution and 3D data as the Shroud image cannot allowed anyone presently to discard the possibility (which is the most probable in my mind) that the Shroud image can be the result of a natural interaction between the dead body of the Shroud man and the surface of the cloth.","date":"November 5, 2013 at 11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/should-we-be-reassessing-the-vp-8-results-continues-previous-post/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Should we be reassessing the VP-8 results (Continues Previous Post)"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Despite the arguments of pseudo skeptics like colinsberry that Alan.

Why not?  Because there are no other shroud with a body image like this elsewhere?  This is not an argument since we don’t have any other intact burial shroud of a crucified person for antiquity!  And why is it that way?  Because the fact that someone was buried in a pure linen shroud of high quality during antiquity after he had been crucified with the Roman method is most probably ALSO UNIQUE, as it is for the Resurrection!  So, I think it’s fair to say that the Shroud is a singular object and so is the burial of a crucified man in a pure linen shroud of high quality, which can be one major cause of the image formation.  Another one is most certainly the fact that this man did not stayed in contact with his Shroud for more than 72 hours, which is another pretty “singular” feature for a dead corpse that has been buried during antiquity!So, you see?

If it doesn’t, oh well-I included an informal resume because I believe it might give some credence to having been there, done that-it is not intended as a personal trumpeting exercise.   I have personal experience with peer-review-I have authored, co-authored numerous manuscripts (>40) in scientific journals.  I have submitted and been awarded multiple national research grants   I have served as a reviewer on various journals and on various grant review panels.  I am still invited to review articles for scientific journals on an ad-hoc basis, several times a year.  Peer-review has its issues, it is not immune to bias-egos and personal vendettas can enter into the equation, when they shouldn’t be a part of it.  Overall, I believe the merits outweigh the bad things.  A certain amount of respectability is awarded with peer-review, as it should be-it is difficult to imagine not having such a system in place to evaluate scientific findings.  Peer review does not equal infallibility-it does not guarantee that the results or the interpretation given to them are beyond reproach, never to be questioned-it is the very nature of science to reevaluate and reinterpret previous results.  Online publication has helped to speed up the peer-review process, and make results more readily available, which in my opinion, is a good thing.

(along with the opinions of Scavone and Tycner-Wolicka) proves what I always say:  in historical research, you can make all kinds of extrapolations… Let’s avoid any kind of extrapolation for a second…  Here’s what we can take out of the list of relics included in the 958 letter of Constantine VII:1- The list include the words “spargana” (normally meaning “small cloths” or “linen strips”) and “sindon” (normally meaning “shroud” in the context of such a list of relics of the Passion), which are often found together in many lists of relics from Constantinople (dated between the middle of the 11th century and the beginning of 13th century) as well as in the list of relics of the Passion that we found in the manuscript entitled De Imaginibus writen by St John Damascene in 726 or 730.  This is not at all unusual to see both terms in a list of relics of the Passion and there is not a single one of those list that contain one specific term or mention to suggest that the sindon can be the same thing as the Mandylion (or even just related to the Mandylion or the Abgar legend in some way).2- The expression “which God wore” (Scavone translation) or “God-carrying cloth” (Tycner-Wolicka translation) should not be seen as a clear and direct reference to the presence of an image on the cloth.  To remain prudent and rational, it is much more probable to understand Constantine’s expression as a way to say that this sacred shroud (sindon) was a cloth that covered the body of Christ in the tomb for some time after his death.3- This list of the relics of Christ’s Passion made by Constantine VII DOES NOT INCLUDE A SPECIFIC AND CLEAR MENTION of the Mandylion.  4- Since the terms “Mandylion” and “Image of Edessa” were well-known in Constantinople at that time, there is no good reason why Constantine VII would not have used one of them in his list if he would really have wanted to include the Mandylion in his list of relics of the Passion.5- The fact that Constantine’s list of relics doesn’t contain a specific mention about the Mandylion is very interesting because we can find EXACTLY the same thing in the Damascene manuscript I mentioned above!  Effectively, if we compare the list of Damascene and the list of Constantine VII, we find out that they are VERY SIMILAR in their content and that they DOESN’T mention specifically the Mandylion as being a relic of the Passion. And what is very important to note is that the Damascene manuscript talk also specifically about the Mandylion and the Abgar legend but in another section (another book to be exact), which means that, for St John Damascene, the Mandylion had NOTHING TO DO with a relic of the Passion, which is something we can also find in the Acts of Thaddeus (with a specific mention to the burial cloths in the lost tomb in a part of the story that has nothing to do with the miracle of the imprint of Jesus face on a towel).Rational conclusion (which try to avoid to make any wild extrapolation or speculation): We have a list of relics made by Constantine VII in 958 that doesn’t talk specifically about the Mandylion (even though this great relic arrived in his city just 14 years earlier), but that specifically mention the same burial cloths associated with Jesus’ Passion as many other later lists of relics from Constantinople, as well as a previous list made by St John Damascene in 726 or 730.  And since Damascene’s list is very similar to the list of Constantine VII, we have to conclude that they most probably refers to the same “batch” of relics of Christ’s Passion.  Now, is it still possible that the Mandylion could have been present in those lists, even though none of them made a specific mention of that cloth (in some hidden way or because some of them used some vague terms to talk about it)? We have to say “no way” to this question.  Effectively, we can be confident to say this for the good reason that it was clear for Damascene (as well as for the author of the Acts of Thaddeus) that the Mandylion had nothing to do with a burial cloth of Christ’s Passion…  So, since it was clear like this for Damascene and since his list refers probably to the same “batch” of relics as the one of Constantine VII, we can conclude that Constantine’s list most probably doesn’t refer at all to the Mandylion and therefore, we can also conclude that the Mandylion and the Shroud of Christ were 2 separate cloths and that the Mandylion was not a relic of the Passion of Christ (just like we can see for ourself in every known depiction of the Mandylion).  Seriously, once we compare this list of relics made by Constantine VII to the one made by Damascene and once we understand that, for Damascene, the Mandylion had nothing to do with a relic of the Passion, we can therefore consider this 958 letter writen by Constantine VII as another good piece of evidence to support the conclusion that the Mandylion was a different cloth than the Shroud of Christ and that this shroud had nothing to do with the Abgar legend in any way. Of course, with lots of speculations and extrapolations, people can come to a different conclusion (Scavone and Tycner-Wolicka’s point of views are there to prove this), but if we avoid to do those kind of wild spéculations and extrapolations (like I think I have just done so), then we must conclude that the Mandylion was most probably a different cloth than the Shroud of Christ and that it had nothing to do with a relic of the Passion of Christ.","date":"January 18, 2014 at 10:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Matthias, here’s one question for you:  If you are an historian and you have 100 authentic ancient documents in front of you and 99 of those are talking specifically about the imprint of the face only of the living Christ…  Would you throw all those references to the garbage and only keep the one that is different?By doing so, you would prove as much non-profesionnal and completely biased as the ones who only take the C14 dating result of 88 to disprove the authenticity of the Shroud!My advice for you:  please don’t fall into that trap!  The document you mention is the only one I know (along with maybe another one writen later on) that mention specifically the presence of a full body image on the Mandylion, while there are tons of ancient manuscripts who are talking specifically about a simple image of the face of the LIVING CHRIST.

Latros (although I saw claims of earlier apperance) -and is quite rarely used. The Mandylion is described in various sources as mantile, himation, tetradiplon,cheiromaktron, manutergium among others.”My answer:  Honestly, I cannot tell if you’re right or wrong here, but one thing I know (because I have read a lot of ancient sources on the subject): Almost everytime you find a reference in an ancient source about the Mandylion (or the Image of Edessa), you also find a pretty clear reference to the Abgar legend!  Taking this into account, I remind you that, in this 958 letter of Constantine VII, there is no specific mention about the Mandylion, the Image of Edessa or simply about the Abgar legend.  Therefore, any conclusion that maintain that there is a real reference to the Mandylion in this letter of Constantine is a pure speculation that have no solid historical or textual base. This is exactly what I meant by “WILD SPECULATION”.You also said: “All the lists about the relics of the Passion are very similar, because the set of items was well known, and it not necessarly mean that all those relics were in possesion of Emperors at given time.”My answer: Because those lists are so similar (this is true for the lists mentioned by Damascene and Constantine VII, as well as for many other later lists of relics from Constantinople), I think the most rational conclusion we can draw is to assume that they were both talking about the same “batch” of relics of the Passion.  Effectively, I have a real hard time to believe that, around the same era, there could have been 2 different batch of relics that could have included all those same items that we find in the lists mentioned by Damascene and Constantine VII.  Of course, we can’t be 100% sure about this, but the most rational conclusion is certainly the one I just draw…  Look at the description of both list I made in my new comment and you’ll see that the number of similar items is very high and, therefore, push in favor of my conclusion: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/#comment-73748One last thing about this: In order for my analysis and conclusion to work all right, it is not important if the “batch” of relics described by Damascene were already kept in Constantinople or were kept elsewhere (in Jerusalem for example) at the time he was writing. The only important thing to note is the great similarity that exist between both lists, which indicate a high probability that both authors were talking about the very same “batch” of relics of the Passion…You also said: “It is impossible to avoid wild speculations here and you hadn’t done so. Your reasoning has several hidden assumptions, of which you are maybe not even aware. My answer:  There’s a huge difference between making the most rational assumption you can do (without any bias in favor or not of Wilson’s hypothesis and only based on what we can find in ancient sources) and the kind of wild speculation I just mentioned…You also said: “For example you assume that John Damascene knew the true nature of the (contemporary version) of the Mandylion in Edessa, which is not certain, he probably knew only legendary version of it.”  My answer:  What I assume (and this is only based on what we find in the texts) is this:  For Damascene, AS WELL AS FOR THE AUTHOR OF THE ACTS OF THADDEUS, the Mandylion was a completely different cloth than the Shroud of Christ and had NOTHING TO DO with his Passion, death and burial.  And such views of these 2 ancient writers is in total agreement with all the known artistic depictions of the Mandylion.  I think it’s fair to say that when you put all those solid references and pieces of evidences together, it is not hard at all to conclude that the Mandylion was not the same cloth as the Shroud of Turin…  This is how the historical method should be used.  I hope M. Freeman can back-up my statement here!You also said: “You also assume that Constantine VII shared Damascene views, which is another assumption. And so on.”My answer:  Because of the high similarity of both lists of relics of the Passion (see again: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/#comment-73748), it’s pretty fair to assume that both writers were talking about the same “batch” of Christ’s relics.  And taking this probable fact into account, here’s my thinking: since it was very clear for Damascene and for the author of the Acts of Thaddeus (as well as for many authors who made lists of relics of the Passion in Constantinople between the middle of the 11th Century and the 13th Century) that the Mandylion was a completely different cloth than the Shroud of Christ (and his other burial cloths), then it is pretty fair to conclude that the spargana and the sindon mentioned in the list of Constantine VII also doesn’t refer at all to the Mandylion.","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"I agree 100% with M.

Freeman who said that, most probably, the Mandylion was forged during the 6th Century. In regard of all the known ancient sources (particularly the Doctrine of Addai and a testimony of the 5th century), I think there is another interesting possibility…  I think it is possible that the Mandylion was originaly created (painted) around the time the Doctrine of Addai was written (around 400 A.D.) in order to back-up the fact that, in this legendary text, there is a mention of a portrait of Christ made by the artist of king Abgar, which was supposedly taken back to Edessa and given to the king, who placed it in his palace.  So, how about this:  Could it be possible that, at first, the Image of Edessa was not considered at all as a Holy relic with a miraculous imprint of Jesus face on it, but simply as a painted portrait of Jesus that would have been made by an artist of king Abgar, during Jesus lifetime (which is what we got in the doctrine of Addai) and, later on, probably during the 6th or maybe the 7th century, the Byzantine Church (with the help of the Acts of Thaddeus and the manuscript of Evagrius Scholasticus) made believe that this painted portrait of Jesus was not at all a manmade portrait but was truly a miraculous imprint of his face?  Note that this “change” of nature would have occurred at least 150 years or maybe more after the creation of the painted portrait of Jesus and I think it is possible that a gradual fainting of the portrait’s colors could explain the later idea that such an image had been miraculously created by Jesus with the help of his sweat.  Again, this is just a possibility that I throw to all of you for your personal reflection…","date":"January 20, 2014 at 11:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Thank you very much M.

First of all, in the Narratio, we can find 2 versions of the same legend and one of them still locate the action before the Passion of Christ (which can be seen as the “traditional” version of the legend).  This is important because if the second version was due to a better understanding of the hypothetical bloody nature of the Mandylion, it is highly probable that the author of the Narratio would have only kept the new version (while putting the focus on the presence of blood in the sweat, which is not the reality), while leaving aside the “traditional” version of the legend.Secondly, and this is more important, the location of the action in Gethsemane is probably due to the presence of the word “sudarium” in another previous manuscript of the legend, which is used to describe the cloth that was used to Jesus to wipe his face, leading to the miraculous imprint.  This previous manuscript if called “The letter of the three patriarchs to Emperor Theophilus of Constantinople”, which is dated to the first half of the 9th century.  Even though this text used the word “sudarium” to describe the cloth with the miraculous imprint, it still located the action BEFORE the Passion of Christ (the letter specified that the miraculous imprint happened “while the Lord and Saviour was on earth”), which is similar to the “traditional” version of the Abgar legend, which locates the miraculous imprint some days before the beginning of Jesus’ Passion!  In fact, it most probably used that term “sudarium” simply because the author of the text said that it was Christ’s sweat (instead of the water he used to washed his face, which is found in the first versions of the legend) that was used by him to produce the miraculous imprint OF HIS FACE ONLY (the text is specific about the fact that Jesus only wiped his face with the cloth).  Note that, in this version, the sweat of Christ had NOTHING TO DO with the bloody sweat described by St Luke in the story of the Passion…Taking all those information into account, I think it’s fair to conclude that this new version that we find in the Narratio (which locate the action in Gethsemane) is only an extrapolation that originate from the previous use of the word “sudarium” by the author of “The Letter of the three patriarchs to Emperor Theophilus of Constantinople” and his idea that the miraculous imprint was done by Jesus with the use of his sweat (again, normal sweat in this version and not the bloody sweat described by St Luke in his Gospel).  What reinforces this assumption is the fact that we can find a direct reference to this particular letter in the Narratio!  It is also possible that such a change of location was also inspired in some way by some theological views of the Church of Constantinople, which we can possibly found an echo in Gregory Referendarius’ speech (which, as Guscin told us in a paper he wrote some years ago, can’t be taken in any way as a clear and direct reference to the presence of bloodstains on the Mandylion)… On this subject, it is very interesting to note that, in his speech, Gregory refers also directly to this letter of the three patriarchs, which shows the great influence this manuscript (and the reference to the sweat used by Christ to form the image on the cloth) had in Constantinople at the time the Mandylion came to this city (which is the same era in which the Narratio was written).  In such a context, it is highly probable that the development of the second version of the Abgar legend we see in the Narratio (which located the action in Gethsemane and talk about the bloody sweat of Christ), as well as the speech of Gregory, was mainly influenced by this letter of the three patriarchs and his reference to a sudarium and the sweat used by Christ to form the image on that cloth (again, a normal sweat and not the bloody sweat of Gethsemane).Again, to understand an important change in the legend of Abgar, it’s very important to understand the historical context and to take into account the previous texts that talk about the Abgar legend and the story of the miraculous imprint of Jesus’ face.  One last note:  In the second version of the legend that we find in the Narratio (which locate the action in Gethsemane), the focus is put in his sweat (which he would have wipe out with a cloth, thus producing the miraculous imprint), and not on the blood that could have been present in his sweat.Taking this new version that is found in the Narratio and extrapolate that this is a clear piece of evidence that there were bloodstains on the Mandylion is just something any good and honest scholar would never do…  Once we put things in the right context, such an idea is clearly a wild extrapolation, just like the idea that Gregory Referendarius’ speech contains a direct mention to the presence of bloodstains on the Mandylion.","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Just to emphasize what I said about the great similarity that exist between the list of relics of the Passion that we find in the manuscript « De Imaginibus » writen by St John Damascene in 726 or 730 and the list of relics of the Passion we can find in the letter of Constantine VII written in 958, here’s the details of both lists:Damascene’s list:–The wood of the cross–The lance–The sponge–The reed–The nails–The sacred linens (spargana, which can be translated as “small cloths” or “linen strips”)–The shroud (sindon)Constantine’s list:–The wood of the cross–The lance–The titulus of the cross–The reed–The sacred blood of Christ–The tunic–The sacred linens (spargana, which can be translated as “small cloths” or “linen strips”)–The shroud (sindon)I hope this is enough for you to conclude, like me, that both authors were most probably referring to the same “batch” of relics of Christ’s Passion.  Effectively, it is highly improbable that, between Damascene and Constantine time, there could have been two separate “batch” of relics of Christ’s Passion so similar in their content.  But since Damascene doesn’t tell where those relics were kept, it is impossible to know if they were already kept in Constantinople at the time he was writing his manuscript.  Nevertheless, the fact that he made a clear separation between those relics of Christ’s Passion and the Abgar legend (including the Mandylion) must be considered with great care when it’s time to analyze the content of Constantine’s list, because the relics mentioned by this Emperor of Constantinople were most probably the same relics as the ones mentioned by Damascene some 200 years earlier…Note that because of the proximity in time between the testimony of Arculf (who saw a shroud of Christ in Jerusalem in 670) and the manuscript of Damascene (726 or 730), it’s truly possible that the Shroud mentioned by Damascene was the same as the one Arculf saw in Jerusalem and, therefore, it is also truly possible to think that this shroud of Christ was still kept in Jerusalem at the time Damascene was writing his manuscript.  This assumption is reinforced by the fact that Damascene included many Holy places of Palestine (he mention, among other places, Mont Sinai, Nazareth, Bethleem, Golgotha, the Holy sepulchre, the mount of olivier, the garden of Gethsemane, etc.) along with his list of relics of Christ’s Passion…To summarize all I said in all the posts I made on this topic, I would say this:  IF (the “if” is important of course) the burial cloths mentioned by St John Damascene in his list of relics of the Passion are the very same cloths as the ones mentioned by Constantine VII in his own list of relics, then we have to conclude that Constantine’s list doesn’t contain any reference to the Mandylion as being a relic of the Passion of Christ and, therefore, the Mandylion was not the Shroud of Christ and had nothing to do with his Passion, death and burial, which would be totally consistent with the vast majority of the versions of the Abgar legend and totally consistent also with all the known artistic depictions of the Mandylion. And to conclude, I want to say this:  Because I’m convinced that the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth, I would like to find as much as you a rational historical path for this cloth from the moment it was found empty in the empty tomb to the time it get to Lirey, France in the middle of the 14th century.  Nevertheless, because of my long inquiry on the subject, I am profoundly convinced that the Mandylion’s trail is not the right path to follow in order to build a rational history for the Shroud before his arrival in Lirey.  The only value I’m ready to give to the Mandylion is the probable fact that such a depiction of the face of the living Christ was based (directly or, more likely, indirectly) on the image of the face of Christ that we see on the Shroud of Turin.  No more, no less than this. And for the Shroud’s ancient path, to remain prudent, I like to think that it was quietly transferred directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople at some unknown date (possibly before the transfer of the Mandylion, if the letter of Constantine VII is authentic).  After all, from ancient sources, we know that other relics of Christ’s Passion (like the lance, the sponge, the wood of the cross, the crown of thorns, etc.) were transferred that way directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople for their protection, without ever spending one day in Edessa…  Question: Why those transfers are known and not the transfer of the Shroud?   Maybe because this relic was more important than the others (which would have made it more attractive for the enemies of the orthodox Christians like the Arabs, the Persians or some heretic group).  Consequently, for its protection (and maybe to avoid some invasion thread of Constantinople), it was better not to tell anything about such a transfer and keep it secret.  Of course, this is just a possible explanation and others can be put forward…  But in the end, whatever the reason, I still believe that, in the light of all the known historical sources concerning both the relics of the Passion and the Mandylion, a direct transfer from Jerusalem to Constantinople without a séjour in Edessa is the most rational and prudent hypothesis we can draw for the Shroud of Turin.  I hope that even the most fanatical of Wilson’s fan out there will at least recognize that such a hypothesis is POSSIBLE (I don’t say probable, just possible).","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"And to share also my long reflection on the subject from the point of view of someone who believe the Shroud is authentic but who became convinced that the Mandylion cannot be the same thing as the Shroud…","date":"January 20, 2014 at 10:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Note:  I just realize that there are 2 words in French in my previous post:Mount of olivier:  Read “Mount of Olives”Séjour:  Read “stay”.Sorry.","date":"January 19, 2014 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"O.K., I don’t say this to be mean, but simply because this is a question that I rarely see asking regarding this issue of the Mandylion, while, to me, it’s the most important question of them all…","date":"January 20, 2014 at 3:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Why don’t you start by answering the very good question (which I’m really not sure you ask yourself before) that can be found at the end of this comment of mine: https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/#comment-73832","date":"January 20, 2014 at 3:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Dave, I salute your open-mindedness versus other hypotheses than the one proposed by Wilson, but I have to say that I disagree with you about your idea that his hypothesis (or something close to this) has some chances to be correct, especially when we take into account all the pertinent data (ancient sources, known artistic depictions, theological and religious context of the time in which the numerous changes to the original Abgar legend took place, etc.).  Sorry but there are too many problems with this hypothesis (no matter if it’s one of the only hypothesis available out there) and, on the other hands, there are too many pieces of evidence that exist to show that the Mandylion was only showing the face of the living Christ without any bloodstains or injuries that, if we want to remain serious and honest, we must at least put the tag « highly doubtful » (if it’s not the tag « proven wrong ») over it.In the end, the most important question we must ask ourselves in order to judge of the validity of Wilson’s hypothesis is this one :  Does the numerous changes we see in the Abgar legend, which occurred over the centuries are due, as Wilson think, to a better understanding of the real nature of the Mandylion (which would have occurred progressively) or wouldn’t it be due instead to some progressive changes in the socio-cultural, religious and theological context in the Middle East (especially concerning the great fights of the orthodox Church against the various heretic groups out there at the time)?

Effectively, I told you that we could found a reference for the transfer of some relics of the Passion directly from Jerusalem to Constantinople.

In fact, there is no reference anywhere concerning the transfer of the crown of thorns, even though there are references for the presence of this relic in Jerusalem and, later on, in Constantinople…  This is important because it seems to be the same thing for the Shroud.  And concerning the 3 other relics (the wood of the cross, the sponge and the lance), there really is a reference about their direct transfer from Jerusalem to Constantinople.  I found it in a very interesting paper entitled “Sacred relics and Imperial Ceremonies at the Great Palace of Constantinople” that was written by Helger A. Klein in 2006.  In this paper, we learn that this transfer happened in 629 and was reported in the manuscript “Chronicon Paschale”.  Taking all this into account, I’ll leave you with this question: If there really were a direct transfer of some relics of the Passion from Jerusalem to Constantinople before the transfer of the Mandylion from Edessa to Constantinople, why wouldn’t it be the same for the crown of thorns and the Shroud?  After all, based on ancient sources, these are the only 2 places that we know for sure (without having to use wild speculations and extrapolations) where those 2 relics were kept before the sack of Constantinople of 1204.

And even after this time, we got a lot of references to a Shroud of Christ (a few in Palestine and a lot in Constantinople), but each one of these (except the testimony of de Clari) doesn’t mention any image on it…  In such a context, it’s very hard to tell if all those early references are talking about the Shroud of Turin or another shroud (or other shrouds).","date":"January 21, 2014 at 11:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/18/wilson-shroudies-vs-academia-another-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Wilson & Shroudies vs Academia:  Another Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"anonymous","post":"I think the hypothesis of M.

In that regard, the Mandylion was most certainly one of the best “tool” the Church invented and developed to achieve his purpose.Question:  Maybe I mist it, but I would like you to explain to me how in the world you can think the shroud that Arculf saw could have been the same thing as the Mandylion, while we know that, in 670 A.D., the Mandylion was still kept in Edessa and not in Jerusalem?

That means that there are only two types of fibrils in image areas: a) Fibrils that possessed the same background color as the ones located in non-image areas. b) Others that possessed a higher optical density value, which are responsible for the body images (ventral and dorsal) that we see on the cloth.”And when I talk about a “scorch”, I talk about a transfer of heat much higher than the natural heat release of a human body (living or recently dead).  I talk about a kind of transfer that would release a massive dose of heat energy that, if we believe Fazio and Mandaglio’s conclusions, is much too strong to produce the kind of discontinuous distribution of colored fibers we see on the Shroud that was summarized by them in the quote I just gave you (and which is part of their upcoming paper about the Shroud).","date":"November 14, 2013 at 11:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"And here’s another very relevant part of the upcoming paper written by Fazio and Mandaglio on that particular subject: “In the introduction, we have affirmed that both radiative and artistic forgery hypotheses must be discarded. Indeed, it is theoretically impossible for these mechanisms to produce a subtle body image on linen like we see on the Shroud with an unpredictable mix of fibrils (10-15 µm each) that would be yellowed, along with some others that would preserve their background color in a same region (Pellicori and Evans, 1981). In fact, UV radiation (Di Lazzaro et al., 2010 and 2012) or the action of an electrostatic field (Fanti, 2010 and 2011), as well as manmade chemical and thermal treatment (Garlaschelli, 2010) always affect, without distinction, all the linen fibrils. On the contrary, in order to reproduce the Shroud body images (ventral and dorsal) correctly, the fibrils must be yellowed with respect to the trend (linear regression) of the correlation between the image intensity and the cloth-body distance. For the three mechanisms mentioned above, it is possible to yellow fibrils of linen, but without respecting the fact that on the Shroud, there are fibrils with background color mixed with others that have been yellowed by the image formation process, which all show the same greater value of optical density. In other words, the action of these mechanisms can yellow or color all the fibrils in the areas they affect with the correct image intensity values, but without being able, at the same time, to respect the discontinuous distribution of yellowed fibrils that has been noted, at microscopic level, on the Shroud of Turin by the STURP team (Pellicori and Evans, 1981). Nevertheless, we can acknowledge the fact that the radiative hypothesis can reproduce the very small thickness of the Shroud image (Mottern et al., 1980; Weaver, 1980), but without being able, at the same time, to reproduce the discontinuous aspect of the yellowed fibrils in the image area. On the other hand, the hypothesis of an artistic forgery is not able to account for the fact that the formation of the bloodstains on the cloth has preceded the body image formation. Indeed, in this case, the predisposed bloodstains would have been damaged by both chemical and thermal treatments. It should be noted that, in the case of Garlaschelli’s work, he created false bloodstains on the cloth after the creation of the body images (ventral and dorsal), without any respect for the reality of what really occurred on the Shroud.”Now, if you still believe the Shroud image is the product of a scorch, that’s your freedom.","date":"November 14, 2013 at 11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"You should reflect upon the evidence given by the bloodstains instead.

That’s what Fazio and Mandaglio think.  This was not exactly what Rogers thought.  For Rogers, the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers was not due to an image formation process that was stochastic but it was mainly due to the evaporation-concentration phenomenon that happened at the end of the making of the cloth, which produced a discontinuous distribution of carbohydrate impurities on the top surface of the cloth (as well as on the top of the affected fibers – this is truly important to understand). In other words, concerning Rogers hypothesis, this evaporation-concentration phenomenon would have been the stochastic process leading to a discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area instead of a stochastic image formation process.But anyway, I think it’s possible to merge the 2 hypotheses into a viable one that would be very interesting…","date":"November 12, 2013 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Additional comment:  Rogers believed that heat could have taken part in the image formation process, along with a diffusion of post-mortem gases and you can find a proof of this in the 2001 paper of Rogers that was recently published on Barrie’s website.

It could not have been the sole contributor.”If Rogers thought that heat “could not have been the sole contributor”, it’s probably because he did not thought of the possibility of a stochastic process involving only a very small amount of energy that would have produced a latent image on the Shroud.  I’m pretty sure Rogers was thinking of a process that produced a higher amount of energy released by the dead body than the very tiny quantity (still undetermined) that is probably needed to produced a stochastic process that could yellowed some fibers of linen…  That’s what I think.  But one thing’s for sure:  Rogers, no more than Fazio and Mandaglio, excluded a release of heat by the fresh corpse of the Shroud man, as a possible solution for the Shroud image (at least partially).","date":"November 12, 2013 at 5:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"I have not answer yet because I don’t have those information in details…  All I know is that both Fazio and Mandaglio organized 2 important conferences about radiations with scientists coming from all around the world!

In all logic, if the body of the Shroud man would have released one of those high energetic radiation (which is, by the way, scientifically impossible for a dead body), the result would have been a coloration of every fibers hit by such a radiation. In sum, for one particular linen thread that would have been hit by such a high energetic radiation, we should expect to see a coloration of every exposed fibers of that thread (which is not what is seen in the image area on the Shroud) and we should also expect to see a coloration of fibers more deeply into the cloth in the zones of the cloth that were in direct-contact with the body (which is also not what is seen in the image area on the Shroud were there is no more penetration in zones of direct-contact than in zones that were most probably at a small distance away from the body).2-This conclusion also applied for every possible man made forgery technique that could have been used to artificially produce the image on the Shroud, including a scorch or a rubbing.  In these cases, as it is for every possible hypothesis involving some kind of high energetic radiation, we should expect to see a coloration of every exposed fibers of one particular colored thread (which is not what is seen in the image area on the Shroud) and we should also expect to see a coloration of fibers more deeply into the cloth in the darkest zones of the body image (which is also not what is seen in the image area on the Shroud were there is no more penetration in zones of direct-contact than in zones that were most probably at a small distance away from the body).3-Considering these 2 previous conclusions (which are extremely hard to dismiss from a purely scientific point of view), Fazio and Mandaglio turned their attention to a possible natural process (or a series of processes) that could fit better with the portrait given by all the known characteristics of the image and realized that these characteristics (especially the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers in the image area and the extreme superficiality of the image, which is the same in zones of direct-contacts between the cloth and the body as well as in zones of non direct-contacts) were very similar to the results that can be produced by a series of processes known as “stochastic processes”, which always imply a very tiny amount of energy and always give an unpredictable and uneven kind of result that doesn’t affect all the “population” submitted to this small amount of energy (pretty much like we see in the image area on the Shroud were some fibers were colored and others kept their original background color). And here’s an example of this kind of process and the result it could produce (note that such an example is well-known by these 2 nuclear physicists and they gave it in a few papers they wrote about the Shroud image): “It is this kind of process that occurs when many persons absorb small doses of radiation. Such an emission of a little quantity of energy triggers a mechanism with chemical modification that only appear after decades. These modifications, that always affect only a portion of the sample, consist in tumors for some of the persons exposed to small doses of radiation and in yellow fibrils for some of them located in the areas of the fabric that were exposed to a small dose of energy (still undetermined). The same stochastic result can also happen when a group of persons is exposed to a faint pollution due to chemical substances.” In sum, we can say that in face of all the known properties of the Shroud image, Fazio and Mandaglio conclude that the kind of known process that is the most able to yield this sort of very superficial and discontinuous image is a stochastic process, which is totally natural.4-So now that they became convinced that the image formation on the Shroud was most probably of the same nature than others known stochastic processes such as the one they described, which involved small doses of radiation on a sample population, the question they had to face was this one: What kind of weak energy could have been present inside the Shroud while the dead body of the Shroud man was lying there for less than 48 hours?  And they came up with the hypothesis that involved a small release of thermal radiation from the fresh corpse (which, as they wrote, is totally possible in reality and, if we think seriously about it, I believe we can even add that it is probably even truer for the fresh corpse of someone like the Shroud man who had been tortured for a long time prior to his death on the cross). And along with this most probable source of weak energy, they also left the door open to the possibility of a weak release of post-mortem gases that could have affected only a portion of the exposed fibers on the surface of the cloth (because of the stochastic distribution of the carbohydrate impurities as described by Rogers and/or because of the stochastic nature of the coloring process that could have been produced by such a weak release of post-mortem gases).5-Finally, no matter what has been the real source (or sources) of this weak energy that has produced the Shroud image with all its known characteristics (including the discontinuous distribution of colored fibers and the extreme superficiality of the image), the fact that, in their mind, this must have been a stochastic kind of process (or processes) have surely produced a latent kind of image that could have taken even decades before it became fully visible to the naked eye.That’s about it my friends!  Now you got a pretty good summary of the conclusions of Fazio and Mandaglio and you’re free to reject them in block or, on the contrary, to consider them, like I do, as one of the most rational (and therefore, possible) hypothesis that has ever been given by some serious scientists regarding the formation of the Shroud image! But note this:  Such a naturalistic hypothesis (as well as Rogers’ own hypothesis) doesn’t discard at all the possibility of a Resurrection of the Shroud man!  It’s very important for everyone to understand this.  In sum, it’s not because the image on the Shroud would not have been produced by a by-product of the Resurrection or by a miraculous act of God that this means that Christ’s Resurrection is an invention of his disciples! NOT AT ALL…  Linking absolutely the two things (the image and the Resurrection event) is not the best way to look at the Shroud in my opinion and it’s even dangerous on a faith level, because if the Shroud image would be proven one day to be 100% natural (this could well happen if a new series of direct researches are allowed by the Vatican one day), this could go as far as destroying the faith in Christ’s Resurrection of some of those who desperately wants to make such a direct link between these two things and that would be a total shame.","date":"November 13, 2013 at 9:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Course of physic 101:  It is totally impossible to get a discontinous distribution of colored fibers like what have been seen on the Shroud with the means of a scorch or a burst of energetic radiation of any kind.

It’s sad for you but only a very weak transfer of energy can produce such an uneven, highly superficial and unpredictable result in every area of the Shroud image, no matter if it was in direct-contact or not with the corpse.  And in such a context, it’s pretty evident that such a weak transfer of energy must have come from a natural (most probably biological) source, which cannot be many other things than the dead body of the Shroud man (no matter if it was a release of heat from the corpse or a release of a small amount of post-mortem gases or another release from the corpse involving some other molecules).That’s where Fazio and Mandaglio are standing versus the Shroud image and I agree completely with this line of thinking.","date":"November 13, 2013 at 11:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Complementary comment :  Here’s a quote from the upcoming paper of Fazio and Mandaglio about the Shroud image that is very telling regarding the present debate : « We will demonstrate that the known physical and chemical characteristics of the body images and the bloodstains that have been found and/or confirmed by the scientific study of the cloth done by the STURP team in the late 1970s and early 1980s are sufficient to reject the radiative hypotheses (ultraviolet radiation, corona discharge, etc.) and those involving an artistic forgery. Indeed, the physics and the chemistry of the ventral and dorsal images agree with a natural mechanism able to eliminate the apparent discrepancy between the characteristics of the body images and those of the bloodstains. For us, on the Shroud, there are latent body images (ventral and dorsal), yielded by the action of a stochastic process. Therefore, the hypothesis involving an artistic forgery or a miraculous event must be discarded. In every case, the scientific study of the Shroud of Turin must not be influenced by religious or anti-religious feelings. Unfortunately, these kinds of biased studies have already been done many times since 1898 and will certainly occur again in the future, which is something that has contributed to stopping, or at least restraining, the collaboration among many Shroud researchers. Actually, we see many scientists who are involved in Shroud research who are not inclined to the possibility of changing some of their ideas or even just seriously taking account of other points of view about the Shroud. These researchers appear motionless in their convictions and are unable to consider other possible solutions for the problems they study. »  Now, I’ll let you meditate on those truths…","date":"November 13, 2013 at 12:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/09/video-barrie-schwortz-at-the-pikes-peak-prophesy-summit/","cat":"video","title":"Video:  Barrie Schwortz at the Pikes Peak Prophesy Summit"},{"author":"anonymous","post":"Not understanding that you cannot produce a discontinuous distribution of colored fibers with any kind of man made forgery or any kind of high energetic radiation make you look anything but like a real scientist Mr. Farey.And what about your last statement: “If low levels of thermal energy are able to produce a stochastic distribution of degradation on flax fibres, it could obviously be done just as well with a warm statue as a dead body.”If you still believe that a hot statue could have produced the Shroud image while the forger would have taken a real bloodstained burial cloth to do is work (which is what he must have done) and anyway succeed to produced a body image so good that it fooled every medical and forensic experts who have studied the Shroud, then I don’t know why I should waste my time exchanging with you.  This is purely ludicrous and such a scenario have been put aside since the STURP days. Come on!

Starting from this, we come to this simple and rational conclusion : the image must have been caused by some form of interaction between the real dead body of a crucified man and the surface of the cloth.  There is scientifically no other possible solution than this one. If we could agree on this, that would be a very good base to start talking seriously.  And if we believe experts in radiation like Rogers, Fazio and Mandaglio, this kind of interaction that can theoretically produced the kind of very superifical and discontinuous image we see on the Shroud MUST BE one that implied only a very weak amount of energy and therefore, we must exclude every known high-energetic radiation as the possible source of energy responsible for the Shroud image.  Now, what is left?  NATURAL PROCESSES MY FRIEND!  ONLY NATURAL PROCESSES!  And as Fazio and Mandaglio wrote in a paper about the Shroud : the only « mystery » that remains versus the image is what exactly was the source of this weak energy?  These 2 Italians physicists PROPOSED (only a proposal and not a certainty) that a release of heat by the corpse could be the answer.  And since it is theoretically possible for fresh corpse to emit thermal radiation, we cannot exclude this hypothesis for the moment, no more than the one proposed by Rogers relative to a release of post-mortem gases (since it is theoretically possible for fresh corpse to emit some post-mortem gases, especially ammoniac).  I don’t say that the real source of the weak energy must have been heat and/or post-mortem gases.  I just say that it is possible  that these source of weak energy could have played a role in the formation of the Shroud image.
