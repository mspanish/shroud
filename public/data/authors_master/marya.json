{"misc":[{"author":"marya","post":"In 2000, my husband & I were touring northern Italy.  It so happened that the “real” Shroud was on exhibition in Turin for the Roman Catholic Jubilee of the new Millenium.\nMy husband and I stopped in Turin so that we could view this ancient relic of the church.  What I found exciting is that our trip coincided with a “rare” exhibition as normally, a replica of the original is on display.\nMy husband was a skeptic and insisted that he would drop me off and pick me up later as the crowds were large and parking was impossible. Somehow as we drove within a block of the basilica, and unbelievably found a spot just waiting for us.\nAs we went insidea and approached the alter, the shroud was indeed magnificent and awe inspiring.  To those who believe no proof is necessary, for those who do not believe no proof is possible.\nMy husband and I believe that this is the image of Jesus of Nazareth.  I found myself weeping at the alter facing the image.  As I turned to look at my husband, he had tears in his eyes.  (This says alot because he is an industrial engineer and a man of logic and went in to make me happy.)  As we were leaving, my husband thanked me for insisting that he view The Shroud.  \nWhen Jesus was a man who walked among us and preached the good news of salavation, there were those who believed he was the Son of God and those who did not.  So it is today with The Shroud.  All I know is that Jesus was a real man, who spoke the truth about how to live in the world.  He grew to know he was “The Messiah” and did not back down when questioned about who he was and the good news he proclaimed.  This cloth is tangible proof for those who need to “see” to believe.  The rest is a matter of faith.\n\n","date":"July 16, 2009 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/02/20/suffering-of-christ-deepened-physicians-faith/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Suffering of Christ deepened physician’s faith"}]}
