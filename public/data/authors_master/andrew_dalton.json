{"history":[{"author":"andrew_dalton","post":"Thanks to all for the stimulating conversation!\nThe image from Blessed John Paul II’s encyclical Fides et Ratio comes to mind. “Faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth.”  These two modes of knowledge are mutually dependent in such a way that, if we eliminate either one, we get nowhere.  \nIt seems to me that we are used to arguing that reason presupposes faith, but not so much vice versa.  For example, a good scientist, if he is going to make any progress, must trust other good scientists without attempting to prove everything himself.  But it is also true that every believer must first have atleast a working knowledge of the concepts he believes.  You can’t believe, for example, that God is omnipotent if you don’t know what omnipotence means.  In this way, we may say that faith presupposes reason.\nEven the empty tomb works as an argument that appeals to human reason before calling upon faith.  This is stated in the Catechism of the Catholic Church:\n“The empty tomb was still an essential sign for all. Its discovery by the disciples was the first step toward recognizing the very fact of the Resurrection. …The disciple “whom Jesus loved” affirmed that when he entered the empty tomb and discovered “the linen cloths lying there”, “he saw and believed”. This suggests that he realized FROM THE EMPTY TOMB’S CONDITION that the absence of Jesus’ body could not have been of human doing and that Jesus had not simply returned to earthly life as had been the case with Lazarus (CCC 640).\nIf the Shroud helped John move from reason to faith, why shouldn’t it do the same today?\n\n","date":"April 18, 2012 at 1:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/17/the-shroud-as-reasons-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud as Reasons to Believe in the Resurrection"}]}
