{"history":[{"author":"nicholas_rety","post":"One Saturday afternoon, back in the fifties, while living in London’s Earls Court district, I was reading a book about Cheshire’s wartime exploits in the RAF.  The hour was runnung late and I hurried off to buy food for the weekend.   At a corner, just off the Earls Court Road, I passed an old school bus, with a man standing beside it.  I had already passed him when I realized that the man’s face was that of Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, VC, familiar to me from the book I had just been reading.  I turned and spoke to him.  There was no doubt I was standing with Cheshire himself..  He was quiet, unassuming, soft-spoken, intent on showing me a picture of the Turin shroud inside the old school bus.  It took some minutes before I realized that I had just had an encounter with greatness.  By the time I headed for home, he was gone.\n\n","date":"August 21, 2013 at 12:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/27/group-captain-leonard-cheshire-vc/","cat":"history","title":"Group Captain Leonard Cheshire VC"}]}
