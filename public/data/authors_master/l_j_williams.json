{"events":[{"author":"l_j_williams","post":"Thanks Dan for sharing Prof. Tom Kerr’s sketch with Shroud.com’s newest update.\nI quietly attended the 2014 lecture by Barrie Schwortz at St. John’s University who was introduced by my publisher. Barrie proceeded to passionately talk for just over two hours. Not one human in that audience comprehended the passing of that much time. Ironically, words spoken in Mr. Schwortz introduction referenced our current realm in time and space. Then when the presentation concluded, time and space seemed to have stood still. This attribute can only describe presentations that are professional, exciting, intriguing, joyous, serious, factual, casual and astonishing. Mr. Schwortz meets all this criteria and more.\nI was happy that my historical novel Upper Room The Way, 33AD to 57AD played a small part in this event. I am proud that not only I, but also my publisher will make all proceeds go to those who are in need.\nI left, as I arrived, knowing as Mr. Schwortz knows… This is not about us.\nL. J.
