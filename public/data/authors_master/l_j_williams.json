You provided more data and facts in one post than CNN could do in their one hour TV show called Finding Jesus. You proved that just speaking the facts and truth about the Shroud is more powerful than any one hour show made up of ostentatiously recreated scenes. Basically, the first CNN episode lied to their viewers by the process of omission!

I quietly attended the 2014 lecture by Barrie Schwortz at St. John’s University who was introduced by my publisher. Barrie proceeded to passionately talk for just over two hours. Not one human in that audience comprehended the passing of that much time. Ironically, words spoken in Mr. Schwortz introduction referenced our current realm in time and space. Then when the presentation concluded, time and space seemed to have stood still. This attribute can only describe presentations that are professional, exciting, intriguing, joyous, serious, factual, casual and astonishing. Mr. Schwortz meets all this criteria and more. I was happy that my historical novel Upper Room The Way, 33 AD to 57 AD played a small part in this event. I am proud that not only I, but also my publisher will make all proceeds go to those who are in need. I left, as I arrived, knowing as Mr. Schwortz knows… This is not about us. L. J.
