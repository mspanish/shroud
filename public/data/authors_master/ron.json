Never mind. what should be clear to all is that while there are indeed 5 holes among the red crosses, they are NOT in an L-shaped pattern. They instead form an approximate rectangle with a tail, so are totally IRRELEVANT where “L-shaped” poker holes are concerned. I also think you display a total lack of objectivity in imagining that a region of the manuscript covered with red crosses represents part of a Shroud that is elsewhere said to show a herring-bone weave, and you do not earn kudos by telling others to get glasses to see things that ARE NOT THERE.You are no scientist, Ron, and I suspect you never will be, based on present performance. Maybe if you were a scientist, you would begin to understand the irritation that I and my scientifically-qualified compatriots feel about non-scientifically-qualified documentary-makers who try to tell us how to do our jobs, who hijack scientific congresses in an attempt to extricate so-called consensus views, who use their privileged access to the Shroud to adorn their blog with an HD close-up that had hitherto been kept hidden from bona fide researchers like myself, with possibly more still to come, and who, last but not least, blocks access to the comments on his site to anyone whom he perceives as off-message – his message.Oh, and to deploy the term “heliorectal syndrome” is not the same as crudely labelling with the A word, not if you know your Greek and Latin. It is a reference to sunshine, and a subtle indication whence it can originate in some people who have too high an opinion of themselves – like prescriptionist documentary-makers who attempt to elicit scientific sound bites that chime with their own opinions instead of reporting objectively on what real scientists are actually thinking and doing…Lack of Objectivity eh! LOL Colin seriously, have you ‘looked’ closely at the pokerhole burnhole patterns on the Shroud? The main burn pattern of the 4, actually has 5 discernable holes (and can be deduced as a (P) pattern) if one wishes, the least of the four patterns has barely 4. The artist may have been depicting this has he saw it. So no, the 5 holes to 4 holes is not irrelevant. Who’s not being objective now?I’m glad I’m not a scientist, if scientists prove to be as errogant, self-assured, and as blinder fitted as you. ;-)Colin, DavidMo et.al; I’ve read and viewed all your post and linked pictures…You have all decided your experts in art, show a number of paintings etc; showing a lid and decide on your own that this depleats the importance of the Pray Codex,…simply nonsense. The artist of the PC may or may not have been following a trend in the depiction of the burial scene art of the time but that does not take away from the ‘idea’ that certain liberties were not taken, in the sense that the artist in question or someone close to him had seen the Shroud in person and decided to add the several identifying marks to thier depiction. David’s argument that we must also look at things missing as opposed to things being there is right, look at most all other paintings; See anything missing? Maybe all these other artists never actiually saw the Shroud, most probable since it went missing for 150 years after the fall of Constantinople. One must not dismiss Orthodox symbolism SHOWN on the PC as opposed to all other depictions shown. THe red crosses do mean something has not only for their shape but for their colour, but you guys would know that from your extensive knowledge wouldn’t you? One must also respect the Orthodox rules of depictions of icons, to understand certain hidden(?) details.Simply put, in my mind, all the other paintings you have shown, although interesting, and honestly I had seen many of them before, do NOT eliminate the PC as a depiction of the Shroud…As for the comments pertaining to Art Historians not being interested in the PC, I see it no different then the many scientists of the world ‘clamming-up” about the disastrous C14 dating and it’s irroneous, if not untruthful result.

It is a small line illustration in a Codex (i.e. early book). The “artist” had no real-life tableau in front of him – he had to draw what was in his imagination, and it’s clear that perspective was something that he (and probably most of his contemporaries) had still to master. That is why it can take the modern viewer a little time just to discern that it is a medieval-style and probably anachronistic sarcophagus with its raised lid that dominates the picture (a fact that seems to have eluded quite a few here too it seems if you go back through earlier posts and comments).That’s why you cannot just stick the Codex under someone’s nose and ask “Tell me what you see”. The answer is likely to be as untutored as the ones we have seen here earlier. You have to present your straw poll sample with rival interpretations, maybe with some background biblical notes, and then ask: “Which is the better interpretation of what you see, viewed within its historical and religious context?”.I too will stop here, rather than repeat what I have already said. I have made my position clear on my own strawshedder blog, and see that it is already listed near the top of page 2 returns of a Google search of # pray codex#.You see, unlike some here, I have to think long and hard before expressing an opinion, knowing that my future credibility as a blogger, to say nothing of search engine rankings, could be undermined by indulging in over-hasty or fanciful judgements.“Think long and Hard” LOL, come on Colin, you along with Mo and curly see a few old paintings with a ‘Lid’, (and let me stress again here that only a few of the dozens upon dozens of burial paintings show a lid at all.) and you instantly come to A conclusion, which to you instantly and nicely eliminates ‘details’ such as the herringbone weave and poker hole depictions, that most everyone sees (sept you ofcourse). But in saying that, everyone can and will have different opinions about the PC, and what it depicts and everyone is free to their opinion. I just think you are wrong on most of your assumptions…I have my own assumptions aswell; such as what we see is the Shroud (outter) side with the herringbone weave, 4 poker holes and wavy blood streaks depicting what can be seen on the outter side of the Shroud. The Red cosses and some red ‘x’s with the 5 poker holes depicts the inner side of the Shroud (the image side), hense the crosses in red depicting the devine one. The ‘Bundle’ you and Matt have been discussing I see as ‘possibly’ the linen strips, not the face cloth as I think the face cloth is depicted slung over Mary’s arm. The PC obviously was not drawn by a ‘skilled’ artist as several amatueristic ‘perspective’ errors were made, but although it’s failings, it does include alot of details and some ‘Byzantine style’ hidden symbols. To me it seems quite clear whomever the artist was had either directly viewed the Shroud or the details were dictated to him. Some details he derived from scripture but some obviously from the Shroud as these details would not be known unless the Shroud was viewed!…Lets not forget many clergy/monks etc; would make their pilgrimages to Constantinople and if the Shroud was there and raised each Friday, one must expect it would have been the foremost attraction one wouldn’t want to miss.

If you want to refute scientific evidence you must provide scientific evidence, not speculation. Speculation about the Codex Pray do not override the carbon14 test.2. Speculation about the holes are not subjective, it is non consistent because need to combine different criteria for the four holes in “L” form and the five as “P”.Please, go to Latendresse page http://people.bridgewater.edu/~rschneid/FocusProjects/Shroud/ShroudMeasure/enrieImg.html and say us the coordenates of the four and five holes that you see in the shroud.Then, go to the ShroudScope ( http://www.sindonology.org/shroudScope/shroudScope.shtml ) click on “Poker Holes” box and explain us how is possible than you see a group of five holes and M.

I cannot reproduce this on Firefox or Safari on a Mac. At which zoom level does it happen and which browser are you using?What might be happening is a gap of one or two pixels between the tiles when the Shroud is displayed. The shroud is displayed as rectangular image tiles of 400×200 pixels. I have seen this on the iPad, but not always. (So far I attribute this to a Safari rendering engine bug on the iPad) It would clearly be seen as a repetitive pattern of vertical and horizontal straight pixel lines right through the entire Shroud image and can hardly be confused with stitches. If you could attach an image of what you see that would clarify what is wrong.As for the level of coincidences of the Pray Codex miniature details and the Shroud, it is important to take into account the entire context and details at the same time. So far, in the discussion that has been going on this post, none ever refer to the essential fact that Bela III, king of Hungary when the Pray Codex was produced, had been at the Constantinople court for a decade a few decades prior to 1293-1295 and was almost at the level of Byzantine emperor while over there. He surely must have seen the shroud that was in Constantinople. Given the fact that the shroud of Constantinople is the most likely place where the Shroud of Turin was, this fact cannot be put aside. In your reply, you did not consider this fact, neither the other clear fact that on the Shroud you have two different patterns of holes: two with a L shape, two others like a P shape (for a better term, they look like a rectangle). This is exactly the two patterns you see on the Pray Codex miniature.These are two details among others.In any attempt to measure the coincidence of such depictions one is left to quantify the probability that all these details find their way together on the same small miniature drawing. And again taking into the global context of the relation of Bela III and Constantinople. (Of course, you already know that the king is financially supporting the Benedictin monastery where the monks lived.)We could actually model such coincidences.And as an aside curiosity about the Shroud Scope, you can see a loose thread that was drop on the Shroud when the shot was taken (a lost thread during the restoration?):http://www.dshroud.com/shroudScope/shroudScope.shtml?zl=11&image=3&lon=3962&lat=6097&poker=tTo all readers, where do you think this thread comes from?Mario your point above about Bela III visiting and living in Constantinople is a strong point! One that the details eluded me when I made my comment that the artist’s specific ‘clues’ on the PC, may have been ‘dictated’ to him. So thank you for making your comment. I would think it would be ‘VERY UNLIKELY’ that Bela III would not have viewed the Shroud, especially with his high standing! He may have even possibly been given direct personal access to the Shroud for the same reason,…better then most for sure. I don’t think there is much speculation in that reasoning also. He may have even had a subordinate make a sketch of the Shroud for all we know, as so much has been lost to antiguity.

You can see similar stains on other parts of the Shroud aswell, as the Shroud was folded when these stains occurred.

Also according to several scientists there are 3d aspects to the image and distortions (slight however) most likely caused by the draping of the cloth.

And as pointed out by another comment from another commentator, It might also relate to the actual emperor who ordered this particular coin to be minted. It might also point to the presence of the Manoppello veil in Constantinople as has been hinted by Max Patrick Hamon. The idea that the nose is curved on the Shroud is not exactly correct. It appears curved since one side of the face is more prominent than the other. Drawing a straight line from the top of the nose to its tip shows a very slight curve, but so small that we could not describe this as curved. Also, it is important to remember that each time the Shroud was laid down to be photographed, the face was slightly shifted left and right, creating slight deviations across the face.

How would you have done it? Would you have taken three 1cm square samples from different areas of he cloth, one for each lab; or would you have taken three 3cm square samples, and divided them so that each lab received three samples, one from each area? And whereabouts on the cloth would you have taken the samples from? This was presumably the problem that Gonella faced, and I should be interested to know how somebody else would have tackled it.I’ll tell you how I would have done it;It’s so simple, one questions the intelligence of the people responsible. Samplings taken from any location ‘centrally-located’ on the Shroud would have been optimal. The numerous charred areas or areas immediately adjacent to them would have been ideal areas in which to extract samples and could have been done from ‘several’ different areas of the Shroud without excessive visible alteration to the Shroud and therefore giving a substantially better ‘representation’ of the whole Shroud.. In fact I believe in 2002 this was actually done during the so-called restoration…fairly large areas were actually removed from the charred areas! So why not in 1988 when it would have been paramount to achieving an accurate c14 reading? Furthermore, to achieve a more reliable conclusion both AMS and the older liquid counter method would have been prudent; at the time a more trusted/reliable method of c14 testing then AMS. This would have of course required a single much larger sample to be extracted, but just one. One must also remember AMS was still in it’s infancy and had not proven to that point to be very reliable, failing miserably in earlier trial runs. The point is, if whomever was responsible for the extracting actually ‘listened’ to the various c14 experts, including Meacham, they would have or should have known this. Therefore, I would conclude there was no substantial reason NOT to extract several proper sized samples from disparate areas of the cloth and that there was several areas to do so, without substantially changing the appearance of the Shroud.R","date":"August 16, 2013 at 10:25 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/08/09/here-is-a-crowdfunding-campaign-we-should-be-able-to-support/","cat":"art","title":"Here is a crowdfunding campaign we should be able to support"},{"author":"ron","post":"“Gove, Meacham and others had indeed been listened to, and their views considered” …Did you mean to write; IF Gove, Meacham and others had been listened too? …because it’s pretty obvious they were not….especially in Meacham’s case.

I don’t say this particular sampling idea is not good however.  As I said, even Meacham changed his mind about that.  So, maybe this could have been the best solution, but it was not kept by the specialists that were there in Turin, because they judged it too risky for contamination and exchange of C14 atoms with some products that could have been present on the cloth at the time of the fire of 1532.Personally, I still think a proper sampling of small pieces of threads taken here and there on the backside of the cloth would offer a very good cluster of dates that could give us a very accurate average age for the cloth, without damaging it too much and while preserving its “good look” for public exhibitions.Back in 1988 you could NOT just take small pieces of thread from here and there and do a proper c14 dating. You needed a minimum of 5mg of pure carbon to achieve a proper test sampling, which meant an original sampling weight of approx. 23 mgs to start with. That would require a fair size piece. Approximately 1/2 of the 50mg pieces given to each lab. Today it can be achieved with as little as 2-3mg pure carbon.Taking thread samples from all over the place and bundling them to achieve the weight would be counter productive because you’d be mingling the sample areas. As I said before; areas immediately adjacent to the scorch’s would have been ideal and they almost certainly should have been aware of this back then.

Yet almost immediately after the finding of the Mandylion (Image of Edessa) in the mid 6th century, hidden in the west gate of Edessa, hidden since possibly the 1st century, the “caricature” changed to the one we see in the Pantocrator and many other renditions found throughout the ancient world, and with an uncanny resemblance to the face we see on the Shroud.

Example; Jesus appearing in the room with basically all the disciples present, as stated quite nicely by Dr. Timothy McGrew in one of his lectures on the reliability of the Gospels, one would have to believe all the disciples had the same illusion and one where Jesus ‘asks’ for a fish, one disciple reaches to another to give the fish to Jesus and they all envision that they see him eating the fish!…..It’s nonsense to believe it was anything but real eye-witness testimony….Why would they make this up?

Anyway, I don’t think anyone has the right to categorically (without any doubt) state that “diffusion (alone) COULD NOT HAVE CREATED THE IMAGE”. When you read Rogers book, you have a sense that he was not discarding that possibility IF VERY PARTICULAR AND RARE CONDITIONS WERE REUNITED. I think it’s much more prudent and correct to think that way, even if I agree on the fact that, on a probabilistic scale, it seems more probable that there was another phenomenon that took part in the image formation along with a gaseous diffusion. But having said that, I also want to emphasize the fact that it surely doesn’t mean at all that this other possible phenomenon was related with the Resurrection of Jesus-Christ. And maybe (just maybe because we don’t know yet) this other phenomenon was just in fact something very similar to the alternative hypothesis proposed by Thibault Heimburger in one of his SSG paper concerning the urea that could have been present everywhere on the skin (and on the hair) after the drying of the sweat…Yannick, Rogers did definately make that statement in his paper. I am not making it up. Furthermore, I also think anyone with any sense can “catagorically” make the statement “that diffusion alone could not have created the image”, just as well as one can claim diffusion alone could.

In the studies of the blood traces/flows, they state that the forehead blood trace was caused by the body being placed face down on the ground and against a hard object. They also deduced the body stayed relatively in this state for almost an hour before being turned over and carried to the tomb.

If only. If the body was washed before being enshrouded, then what are those trickles doing along the arms?

When the heart begins beating, for instance, does it not immediately pump out a fair proportion of the blood through the five major holes in the body? How quickly does Jesus sit up, and doesn’t he feel so faint that he immediately loses consciousness? And having re-animated, does does he flip the shroud off with his arms before sitting up? Or does he slide out sideways? Or sit up with the shroud still covering his face? Although these questions sound flippant, they have direct implications for the appearance of the image on the shroud, and cannot be avoided if we follow ChrisB’s line of thinking. Other resurrection experts have assumed the body simply de-materialised, with or without a burst of energy of one kind or another, the shroud collapsing through the void thus created, and some non-believers think the shroud was simply folded back by the Essenes, who lifted Jesus, alive or dead, away, leaving the cloth behind.Evidence shows the blood was not disturbed, therefore the Shroud could not have been simply pulled or lifted away from the body…so much for the Essene theory.

This was concluded from study of hundreds of skeletal remains found to date in the Isreali/Palestinian area. Roman males on the other hand were known to be short compared to the Jewish population being on average 5′,4″ in height…these are scientific facts, which are indisputable.

Daveb is, of course, eminently sensible, but Ron – if my style of argument is wrong, don’t fall into the trap of using it yourself. My figure of 100 000 crucifixions was based on 1 per day (for 200 years), which I think is a fairly mild assumption, plus, according to Josephus, 500 a day during rebellions. Is that unreasonable? Upon what do you base your “Maybe only 5000 were crucified during the whole period, for all we know” come from? That’s only 10 days rebellions’ worth.Next. You “would assume the taking down of the bodies and proper burial were NOT honoured” when Josephus specifically mentions that they were.Next: “Chances are spearing was a rare and unusual practice.” Now I’m guessing, I admit, but it’s a lot harder to smash a wooden beam against somebody’s legs than to run a spear into their heart. If a crucifixion victim were clearly already dead, the token stab with a spear seems an eminently more efficient guarantee of death than going to the trouble of breaking his legs. What makes you think spearing was rare and unusual?Next: “the excessive scourging as testified by the shroud.” The bible is quite specific in saying that the scourging was not excessive. Whatever, was excessive scourging rare? According to wikipedia (yes, I know) flagellation was used as a prelude to crucifixion, and at least four Roman authors refer to victims who died of their floggings.Next: “the crown of thorns.” What crown of thorns? The Shroud shows numerous bleedings from the scalp, not a crown of thorns. Instead of mocking a man who claimed to be king, a wreath, cap or helmet of thorns could have been inflicted on any leader of any riot, or a soldier, or anyone else who wore identifying headgear.Finally. Where are all the crucifixion victims’ skeletons? Why has only one turned up? Perhaps they have been found. Crucifixion, it seems, may well have left no damage to the bones, as the nails slid past them. The one heelbone we have with a nail right through it would be a clumsy exception to the rule. The associated armbones are undamaged (although some archaeologists claim slight abrasions to the inside edges, others don’t).Nope, I don’t think my assumptions are extraordinary at all.Hugh I think you should go back and read Josephus a little closer. He states clearly that they ‘used’ to bury them properly, but not at that particular time. Meaning except for his few friends, which were taken down, most all that were hanged during the revolt were left to rot. The Romans spared very few, only the woman and children, whom were sold into slavery during and after the revolt in 68…The Romans would not have cared one morsal about Jewish law at that point. Earlier revolts or uprisings in early first century bce or ce palestine were just as violent and uncarring, where most, including woman children were also smited.Where did my 5000 figure come from? Out of a hat just like your 100,000. No one can make an educated or proper guess at the amount crucified. Did Josephus actually count his 5000 a day? doubt it very much, so again an unknown number, that was my point. It could just have been far far less then you GUESSED.Most all of the other comments I made, such as spearing being a rare occurance or the crown “cap” of thorns being used in distinction are not my personal thoughts, but thoughts by others whom have far more knowledge then I into ancient practices.

It has to do with the ‘assumed’ body temperature. Take note; I am not a doctor or a medical student but have been doing alot of research into this matter. With that clear; I can not see the body ever reaching a temp of 40C or even close. My Reasoning; The body had lost an excessive amount of blood well before death, this alone would lower the body temperature to a very low state, already causing the body to compensate, but then after death the body hung from the cross for atleast an hour and stayed out in the air for atleast two hours before being wrapped in the Shroud in the tomb. By this point the body temperature, one would ‘assume’ would be quite low already. The Shroud image shows no signs of putrefaction, no bloating, therefore one assumes the body left the Shroud before then and before any temperature increases due to internal decay could accumulate. One should expect the body temp would have continued to go lower due to the enviroment i.e; a cool tomb and cool temperatures.I may be completely wrong here, but from my studies it does not seem reasnable to expect the body to reach temeratures in the range you mentioned.

My message was the simple obvious statement that any further C14 tests would be pointless unless there was a rigorous truly representative sampling protocol, and I doubted that any further C14 tests would be likely.As yet I have not bothered to read the subject paper, although advanced statistical analysis is well within my technical competence. I am sceptical that any trend has any true significance concerning the Shroud, for the following reasons: 1) I cannot imagine that the very small corner sample taken can in any way be representative of the whole; 2) The work of Rogers in stating that the sample had significant levels of vanillin and cotton contamination indicates that the sample could not be representative; 3) The sample therefore appears to be a patch; 4) I have seen enough costly errors made during my technical career resulting from poorly informed extrapolation of non-representative data; 5) Based on what else we can deduce about the age of the Shroud, I would expect to see a jump in the results rather than a persistence in the alleged trend, that is if C14 has any relevance to this artifact, which indeed seems to be in some question.I am intrigued that Gabriel sees C14 as an obsolete technique. I should really like to be informed of what other scientific dating techniques might be available, more appropriate, as from her comment I take it that she does seem to have some other techniques in mind. Would these techniques be immune from any skewing as a reult of the 2002 “restoration / conservation” activity. Presumably any such new methods attempted would also need the assurance of being adequately representative of the whole, and not just from itty-bitty corners!Right on Dave! Forget all other things; Dave’s points 1 and 2 go to the heart of the matter here. I for one do not accept the 1988 c14 results as being legit, not at all. We must remember this was not 12 separate samples, it was 12 pieces of the same sample and definately “not representative of the whole”. This sample area was also ‘proven’ by STURP research, including infrared images of the area prior to 1988, to be unlike the rest of the Shroud surface, studies, everyone simply ignored!. Anyone who still backs or even contemplates the 1988 c14 dating as being a point against the Shroud’s authenticity, should really get thier heads out of their behinds and do some research on radiocarbon dating, seriously!! No expert in RCD truthfully, would ever accept the conclusions of the 1988 tests considering it’s complete non-adherence to BASIC protocol. It’s a no brainer, the 1988 Radiocarbon dating was deficient, end of story. Moreover Rogers finding of lignin/vanillin in the fibrels is an important ‘clue’ to the Shroud’s real age, yet most will just disregard this evidence or claim Rogers was just wrong…It’s a bad joke.There is at this point in time absolutely ‘nothing’ that refutes this Shroud from being from the first century, (scientifically) speaking, and I strongly believe anyone who argues that point should have their head examined.Oh and here is another clue to the LACK of protocol or standards in the RCDing done in 1988…Clue word; weight …None of the samples tested met the minimum standard weight required for PROPER TESTING! …I call that FAIL!R.","date":"May 2, 2012 at 4:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/28/new-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Peer Reviewed Paper on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin."},{"author":"ron","post":"The forger may not have cared about being authentic, maybe he got a paper cut and bled himself on the thing.

Read again all the STURP papers and you’ll see that possibility that the image could come from a supernatural event was almost absent of them (except maybe the paper of Jackson who tested many image formation hypothesis including radiation). And the argument that the hypothesis of Rogers cannot explain all the characteristics of the image cannot ruled out every possibilities that the image could have been formed naturally (involving some chemical phenomenon). I’m not sure that Rogers was reading to really discard his hypothesis on the basis you mention. The fact is that he didn’t had enough time to fully test his hypothesis… Also, did you ever thought that his hypothesis could only be PART of the solution and other chemical processes could have been present also ? There’s still many natural possibilities that have not been fully tested yet. Until that day come, I will still push in that direction… like almost every STURP member and as any good scientist should.I don’t believe any of the STURP papers touched on the topic directly and there is lots of evidence in many of those papers pointing indirectly to some sort of light phenomena.

It would be nice to be able to watch the whole documentary. It’s also very interesting how much about the 1988 C-14 fiasco is coming to light as of late, but I am sure most of the information has already been published with many people not being aware of it. Many will claim the tests were in error without blaming any of the ‘tester labs’, which to me is a blind statement to the truth. All the labs as well as the Vatican were at fault for a bumbled testing, right from the start. The fact that all protocols were dropped for the choice of samples by the Vatican to the fact that no chemical analysis were done on the samples by any of the labs, too the huge discrepencies found in the final numbers. Not to mention an anonymous donation to one lab of 1.5 million pounds! It (the 1988 c-14 dating) has all the attributes of a true conspiracy. The questions are WHY? and conspired by WHOM?Personally back in ’88 when the test results were splattered all over the media, I did not believe the results, as too much evidence pointed to ‘authenticity’. I could only feel at the time that something wrong had been done, but unfortunately many important people in the study of the Shroud lost interest, which to me was also unbelievable. How could so many put so much faith in a single carbon dating? Especially when anyone with half a brain understood that carbon dating methods are not infallible, even novices as myself understood that! Personaly I don’t believe any further carbon dating will bring us to any certain conclusions as the cloth as been tampered with way too much (2002 restoration) and is far too contaminated to ever get a true date.

All or most of where I acquired this info can be found at shroud.com or you can read “The Rape of the Shroud” by William Meacham. I don’t believe there is any proof to a substitution, but there is evidence of a stunning lax in protocols, procedures etc; Things such as the samples being split into smaller pieces by the labs, and actually too “below minimum threshold weight for proper testing”, no official photos of said samples when received at the labs, no proper examination of the samples before cleaning, BASIC cleaning methods used, “not neccessarily efficient for linen samples of a unknown provenance or history” , and finally to the unorthodox communications between labs before results were published or even while testing was in progress!!

But there is so much more; the CHi value, the manipulation of numbers to ‘gel’ to 3 labs results and done as the procedures were ongoing, AND on and on…The results are ‘SUSPECT’ and proof of this has been shown quite well, and well before the reweaving was brought out and subsequently proven by Rogers. By the way, ASK YOURSELF; who was responsible for the “Trend” conclusions and testing announced recently?.It is not arguable, the facts show the c14 process done in 1988 was a fiasco. The process reeks of unprofessionalism and maybe even a touch of misconduct. Ask any archaeologist, or C14 technician about the 1988 testing and procedures, and they will tell you the results would never be accepted inlight of the issues mentioned, they would throw the results out!

The consensus on the method of manufacture of such large linen sheets would be; that the sheet the size of the Shroud would have been cut from a much larger sheet. The seam would have then been added later. Also think of it aesthetically, these Linen sheets were expensive, who would buy an imperfect sheet with an unsightly seam along it’s full length? …unlikely…One study mentioned before, proposed the seam was just added for some type of hanging method contrary to Jackson’s theory, but I personally find that reasoning illogical, Why not put seams on both or all sides then?

One might as well claim that it’s impossible to brush against an electric iron without risking a third degree burn. There are at least 4 variables that can be independently controlled to get a light scorch affecting the most superficial part of a linen fibre – temperature, application pressure, application time, and presence or absence of a cool and/or damp underlay to act as heat sink.I have today reproduced an earlier experiment with some better controls – the one that showed one can selectively scorch a sheet of onion epidermis – just one cell thick – with no appreciable effect on an underlying sheet of linen.Superficiality is NOT a problem, neither in theory nor practice. Let’s move on shall we?As for radiation, it’s simply a non-starter (although that has not deterred the distractionists and obscurantists from constantly invoking it is as the “likely” or “most promising” model, basically because it serves the purpose of further mystifying the Shroud, instead of demystifying. Radiation is ruled out for the simple reason that production of electromagnetic waves by some miraculous process does not result in an image if there is no focusing or collimating system in place. Neither is there any known means of producing ultraviolet radiation or x-rays from a non-incandescent or non-irradiated material, e,g, a corpse, and even low energy infrared and visible light have their problems – they cannot scorch if there is nothing to absorb them. There’s a basic law of physics – no absorption, no action – and there’s still the absence of lens, mirrors etc to bring to a focus.Yup, it’s a scorch, and a superficial one, at least initially, affecting the thread crowns, and that is a signature of a contact scorch, probably from hot metal – but that’s not what folk want to hear. No problem if it’s ordinary folk – it being a free country. That so-called scientists should be part of a huge distraction exercise is something else… My feelings towards them are one of disgust and contempt… I don’t believe I’ve heard anyone say creating a superficial scorch is impossible, and if so easily possible as you say, then produce one and shut everyone up! But that is not the only aspect your dealing with here Colin and you know that quite well, don’t you. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again it’s one thing to scorch some linen, it’s another to do so with ALL the attributes accompanying that scorch. And that includes creating a scorch which doesn’t fluoresce, a scorch that will create a detailed image with 3D distance information, a scorch that will not effect the blood covering the shroud or bas-relief/statue, …So not so simple when everything is taken into account is it Colin?

Materials such as linen are extremely difficult to date as they can absorb c14 isotopes from various sources and these can inpregnate right into the fibrels making them next to impossible or impossible to be sure all contamination has been removed. He has stated to me and I have read this many times in my own research of RCDating, that contamination is the main cause of numerous erroneous and odd dating that has occurred and STILL occurs on a regular basis.

Please list the others so we can eliminate them also as candidates.Furthermore, crucifixion victims in most of the Roman world were purported to have been left on they’re crosses to rot or to be devoured by animals as a deterent to others. Only in Judea, since the Jewish law would not allow for the bodies to hang overnight, were victims likely removed. So it is safe to assume they would be taken down, and since in only one instance has evidence of a crucifixion victim ever been found in tombs, out of hundreds of finds, it can and is safely assumed by most archaeologists, that most crucifixion victims would have been buried in mass graves, and likely open graves.

So what does this tell us? Just that, as Raes noted, it is impossible to date or allocate the place of manufacture of the Shroud from the weave alone so that approach needs to be abandoned. As DF has accepted the radio-carbon dates for her, much older , samples without comment, I assume she would be happy to use them on the Shroud itself.Incidentally Google Images :’ Looms Greek vases’ will show that large pieces of cloth could be woven and there should be similar evidence in H. Ling Roth’s Ancient Egyptian and Greek Looms. I don’t know where the idea that only small cloths could be woven in ancient times ever came from.I don’t recall anyone ‘EVER’ using the 3 to1 herringbone weave ‘alone’ as evidence for the Shroud “to date or allocate the place of manufacture”, except that it certainly was not manufactured in medieval times, as by then it was not ecomical to do so and the looms themselfs had changed. I also believe archealogical evidence shows quite clearly, large and very large cloths were being created in ancient times, and with various stitch counts, weave patterns and even multiple type stock. I’ve read somewhere of cloths being loomed in ancient Egypt four times the width and twice the length of the Shroud!

I don’t think so, as one would think if she was and if there were any others outside of the ’12’ there, it would have been mentioned…The mention of the ’12’ is simply a ‘title’, as we all know very well that Thomas and Judas were not there.Personally, I cannot find any reason why woman cannot be ordained, or why priests can’t marry. Several of the apostles were married I believe, so what’s the problem. Furthermore we have very little knowledge on what happened to Mary Magdalen and the several other woman that followed Jesus.

I read that the actual thongs of the flagrum (an actual sample of a flagrum found by archaeologists) were made of unequal lengths and the replica they used did not have this feature.(Their replica the thongs were of equal lengths).The reasoning for the uneven thong sizes apparently was so that the thongs or more precisely the dumbells would not tangle (Those romans could be maticulous).This feature would also cause one or two of the thongs (themselfs) to make direct contact on each blow, possibly leaving the welt type marks Faccini and Fanti are taking for a second type of whip.Thanks for reading,Ron","date":"July 29, 2011 at 12:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/27/more-on-flagrum-proportions-and-measurements-and-now-the-side-strip/","cat":"flagrum","title":"More on Flagrum Proportions and Measurements and Now the Side Strip"},{"author":"ron","post":"Hey no problem Yannick, considering your native language is French you are doing an excellent job communicating here, probably better then I, LOL.Anyways I am not against any of your propositions here, I’m on the fence on alot of things about the Shroud (details and understanding the mechanism) not in it’s authenticy ofcourse.I’ve breezed quickly over your comments about the humidity vs.washing debate and although I’m not convinced on it, you have pointed out some very telling points and have made me rehash and re-think alot.Which just means I’ll have to do some more reading and contemplating before I can debate this topic any further.As for your very last comment when it comes to the details of this amazing Shroud, nothing seems to be ‘simple’.I think we can agree on that.Oh almost forgot, several topics back you asked me about my credentials, and to answer;

Although I don’t quite understand or agree with your hypothesis of the wrapping and possible image formation, many things you have said seem to make sense and seem to pass thru Yannicks brain without any thought. He seems to do the same with me, as he ignores simple points I’ve made. His notion that a conclusion; “the body was dry is FACT”, is irresponsible…as this has NOT been confirmed, hense many discussions on the topic. Your right that in both Adler and Barbet were not forensic scientists or medical examiners,…Zugibe was and with decades of experience dealing with corpses, hense his ideas should be respected and listened to and not so easily dismissed by the likes of Yannick, whom has absolutely no experience in the matter. As for other points made in this discussion; I have, through much research also remember reading, I believe from the Talmud, that when washing a victim of violence the areas of ‘life blood’ must not be touched, but with other areas of the body there was no issue. The idea of using, say, a dampened sponge to dab the body to cleanse it is quite reasonable and not against Jewish laws. There is also the issue that apparently in the case of a burial stretching into the Sabbath ‘concessions’ were sometimes made, hense allowing the preparers leave of the law. Meaning, one or two of the people involved in the burial preparations could continue past the Sabbath commencement and could make up for this in various ways. Max you are also correct in the fact that Yannick seems to contradict himself many times in his writings, and shows a lack of chronological knowledge dealing with the post passion studies. I also note some of his points seem to negate or go against his insistence for a maillard reaction!Lets’ remember some points here as to the condition of the body as it reached the tomb, it had been hanging on the cross for atleast 2 hours, it had been placed face first, slightly on the right side in front of the cross for another 45 minutes to an hour…What would the condition of the body be like after this? I would think it would be MOSTLY dry, including any sweat and covered in ground dirt, as the dirt would cling to the still damp blood covering, at the time, most all of the body. This dirt would cover most areas of the body; Where is this dirt on the cloth? They found dirt only on certain areas of the body; the foot, the nose and a single knee cap, where is the inevidibly certain dirt which covered the entire body?…One can then come to the conclusion here that the body must have been cleansed in areas not covered with life-blood. Can one picture them dabbing the body clean, careful not to touch any areas of life-blood, then allowing several minutes for this light dabbing to dry, whilst doing other things, before enwrapping the corpse? Therefore, leaving the body relatively clean of any dirt, sweat or blood in most areas, aswell as being only lightly damp before being enshrouded??…thoughts to this question would be appreciated.R","date":"August 19, 2012 at 1:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/answers-to-many-questions-about-the-fold-marks-on-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"Answers to Many Questions About the Fold Marks on the Shroud"},{"author":"ron","post":"Nope, takes me too Shroud Enigma also, which doesn’t have the segment from the full video in question.","date":"August 2, 2012 at 9:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/01/answers-to-many-questions-about-the-fold-marks-on-the-shroud/","cat":"history","title":"Answers to Many Questions About the Fold Marks on the Shroud"},{"author":"ron","post":"Daveb, …Exactly!

He has not answered MANY questions we put forward, (important questions to contemplate that is) such as Where is the dirt on the entire body image?…Logic states it should be covered in dirt, but it is not. We mention dabbing a wet sponge, he talks about vigorous wiping. He makes it seem like Dr. Zugibe could not possibly be right and is human so he can make mistakes, but refers to his demi-god, Barbet, whom couldn’t possibly be wrong in anything he says or ‘thinks he sees on the shroud image’ but Yannick forgets Dr Zugibe has done thousands upon thousands of autopsies, is working with decades more advanced medical knowledge than Barbet, not to mention photoanalysis technology light-years ahead the 1930s technology.

I did a very brief google search for ancient coins trying to find collars or lapels with that distinctive flex. Well the first thing that struck me was how rare a frontal portrait was on an ancient coin (rough estimate 1 in 200). I was looking for a double line collar with a flex. I only found one double line so far (google “ancient coins front portrait” near the bottom of the page). I agree with your assertion that an artist could quite easily create such a collar without seeing the shroud, but on viewing the coins I’ve seen on google so far, it mightn’t be so daft an idea to query whether this might have happened. I’ll just state again what I find peculiar about this collar is that inflection….artists will normally use an economy of means to indicate form (ie a simple arc would have sufficed, so why the flourish of an inflection particularly if you are doing double close lines where you have to be careful to keep lines roughly same distance apart in a wax original). Just an idea!ArtScience- I think both your observations are well warranted and your not alone in your observations.

The time of 2-2.5 hours fits in well with what has been deduced from research and findings from the Sudarium of Oviedo. These findings being; The Sudarium was placed upon the head of Jesus ‘shortly’ after death, whilst still on the cross. An hour or so later the body was removed from the cross and layed partially face down at the foot of the cross and stayed for approximately another 45 minutes, then the Sudarium was properly wrapped completely around the head of Jesus and the body was moved to the tomb, approximately another 10 minutes, where it was then apparently removed. This gives us a time of 2 to possibly 2.5 hours between death and tomb, if then we accept the time of death between 3-3:30 pm, that puts us in the tomb approximately at 5 to 6pm. Giving a minimum of one hour in the least of scenarios and 2.5+ hours for the max time for the burial preparations… As for Max’s wrapping hypothesis, I have problems with it, some I have mentioned before. I just find it unlikely they would have wrapped the body twice using two different clothes and if the first cloth had been soaked with water & spices or whatever had been placed on it, there should be chemical signs of this still noticeable today, which so far have not been found, to my knowledge. If one wants to use the term othonias as plural, one must accept there MAY HAVE been other cloths there also, as most likely there could have been another large cloth used to transport Jesus from the cross to the tomb, but would have not been used in the wrapping, as it would have been “unclean”.As for the ‘dust’ storm idea, (the darkening of the sky), although it sounds reasonable at first, one must wonder; If this storm was a regular occurence, regularly witnessed and even possibly given a name at the time, why such a mystical attitude given to it in scriptures?? Something definately “UNUSUAL” and not to the ‘NORM’ must have occured instead. That is my simple reasoning against the Sharav or Khamsin hypothesis. Why didn’t they just call it for what is was; a dust storm, the Sharav the Khasmin? Instead they just say the whole ‘SKY’ was darkened.Ron","date":"March 19, 2012 at 4:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/14/nonsense-of-the-day-comments-on-banding-maybe-jesus-looked-different/","cat":"history","title":"Nonsense of the Day: Comments on “Banding: Maybe Jesus Looked Different”"},{"author":"ron","post":"I don’t know about anyone else, but ” I see lettering” on the right side of the image face, starting from the step 1 picture and progressively gets more prominent.

Wilson1.pdf deals very well with several issues raised against the Shroud/Mandylion/Edessa hypothesis, such as the imprint being described as being from a “living Christ” or of the eyes being seen as “open” and specifically the blood. To the blood statement he mentions “if in good light” one may discern the blood markings. This is a point I tried to put forth before but was shunned. Wilson has seen the Shroud first hand, up close in semi-darkness and in good light and with no glass covering. He would know FAR better then most what is discernable and what is not, most definately. It is probable early discriptions of the Mandylion (of just the face), that one could come to the conclusion as Wilson predicts…Wilson is not alone in this area as it has been mentioned by many others, such as Pierre Barbet, whom have had the liberty to view the Shroud in it’s natural form, that it is very difficult to discern details such as the eyes, the blood etc; but especially the blood as it becomes pronounced only slightly in ‘good light’.

It is a well known fact that he was hugely in debt to them and lets’ say jealous and wanting of their wealth and power! …Enough reason right there I would think. As for the templars descriptions given during the trials; Anyone think they may have ‘sworn an oath’ to not reveal it’s true identity? Therefore all the vague descriptions? If they confessed to possessing such a relic, undoubtably the King or even the Church would have demanded possession of such.As for the Templars and the Shroud, I personally am still undecided on whether they ‘possessed’ or just ‘knew’ and venerated it. I wouldn’t be so hard on Ian Wilson as he was going on the Friel’s supposed ‘find’, but as since recanted those ideas in a recent paper. I also believe Wilson’s argument for the Mandylion/Shroud theory does carry alot of weight and is backed by alot evidence; pictorially and literally.But as for the Templars, which I think is the main topic here, although it has been mentioned they had little or no part in the Constantinople sacking, which is probably correct; IT has been deduced that the Shroud was taken to Athens afterwards. From there it would have most probably be taken to Bescanon, but by whom? Remember the Templars were the ‘Fedex’ of the time, santioned by the Church for such duty and in most probability could, or would have been commissioned in the safe delivery of the Shroud and other ‘trophys’. Therefore ‘likely’ they ‘knew’ of it’s existence.

To bad…Did anyone read the part in Freeman’s paper about the ‘folded hanky’ (tetradiplon), where it ends up as a square? LOL. Seriously Freeman’s paper is a joke and the fact he endorses Yannick’s many points, is an even bigger joke. As many of YC’s points have been ‘properly’ refutted by several people here, and not just me, and many many times over. Yet YC simply ignores these arguments, as I would suggest Freeman has also, and YC keeps writing…It makes me nauseated! …Seems to me, Freeman may have chosen to read only YC’s comments on this blog and turned a blind eye to all others.If Freeman’s paper is an example of ‘Historians/scholars writings, outside the Shroud-world’ in attempt to discredit Wilson’s hypothesis, then this is a sad world we live in.R","date":"September 3, 2012 at 6:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/03/part-7-of-the-jones-freeman-brouhaha-about-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Part 7 of the Jones & Freeman Brouhaha about Ian Wilson"},{"author":"ron","post":"Mr Freeman, with all due respect, I’m sorry but I cannot accept your explanation for the ‘fuzzy’ photo.

And because of this particular and, excuse me, completely ludicrous and non-scientific hypothesis, Jackson’s bias regarding Wilson’s hypothesis is as obvious as the nose in anyone’s face…Max, I recommend you to read again carefully the fact #22 in my article. This is TRUE AND CORRECT SCIENCE, not science-fiction based solely on speculations. And what this TRUE AND CORRECT SCIENCE tell us ? That there are absolutely no signs of any kind of physical and chemical differences between the region of the face and the rest of the cloth, not only at thread level, but even at fiber level !!! On this subject, let me remind you that the Spanish team of Sindonology have been able (very easily) to prove what was the side of the Sudarium that was always exposed to the faithful (probably for century) just by the amount of dirt and dust that was more present on this particular in comparison with the other side that was hidden to the eyes of the public (and consequently protected from air and sunlight). Why would it be different in the case the Mandylion hypothesis was correct ??? Come on !!!By the way, this particular hypothesis of Jackson concerning the folds remind me of another ludicrous hypothesis proposed by himself regarding the bloodstains on the Shroud !!! Effectively, in one paper he published in Shroud Spectrum in the 80s, Jackson was pretending that there was not only real bloodstains on the cloth but also “images” of bloodstains !!! Wow ! No doubt that we are right into the Twilling Zone here… :-) And I’m not even talking about his other hypothesis concerning the Shroud that was, in fact, the tablecloth for the Last Supper !!! Totally incredible… It’s the right word I guess.Yannick always keep in mind all hypotheses are somewhat speculative. Secondly you forget the afformentioned folds were noted by the STURP team before Wilson’s first book was even published!, so less likely Jackson ‘thought-up’ his hypothesis from Wilson. The fact that folds cannot be dated is a sticky point, agreed, but not so relevant when the folds have been deemed; “fact” that they exist and prove unquestionably, that the Shroud was for some extended period of time, folded in such a way as it would agree with Wilson’s Image of Edessa ‘landscape’, ‘tetradiplon’ theory. Why do you ignore these facts?Another thing; Just because one hypothesis put forward by someone may prove wanting, does not mean all hypothesis put forward will follow. Anyways as for “images of bloodstains”; Jackson is not the only one who believes so, as some of the blood markings are seen on what some suggest are non-contact areas. Can you prove them incorrect? …I highly doubt so. Also to state that because the Sudarium shows evidence of being dirtier on the ‘assumed-shown-side’ can relate or pertain at all to the Shroud is a HUGE assumption, if there ever was one. Especially when we know very little of how or where they were kept for much of their existence. The EDICES assumption that the dirtier side was the most shown side is completely speculative, there can be other very reasonable causes for this evidence.R","date":"July 12, 2012 at 5:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/29/questions-concerning-the-mandylion-hypothesis-proposed-by-ian-wilson/","cat":"history","title":"Questions concerning the Mandylion hypothesis proposed by Ian Wilson"},{"author":"ron","post":"Yannick you really think anyone would have kept the SHroud in Jerusalem or Palestine till the 8th century, seriously?

THere is no FACTS of whether the Shroud was or was not in Edessa but that is why Wilson hypothesizes the Shroud may have been known as the  Mandylion. Yes folded in 8, covered so only the face showed and then shown very very rarely to anyone. Whether the people in Edessa knew this was a full length Shroud or not, we can only guess, maybe it was never unfurled due too worries of sacrilege? Or maybe it was known that it was a full length burial Shroud but only by a certain few in the hierarchy and kept a secret for obvious security reasons….Only to be realized in 944 when forcefully taken from Edessa.

Remember that the amount of contamination of cloth between 650 and 2000 years old is likely to be minimal compared to that affecting a material object of 50,000 years old , towards the limit of effective radio-carbon-14 dating.Again nonsense from one whom obviously has not studied or understands the issues with C14 dating of artifacts! A ‘material’ buried (sealed) in a tomb or in the ground for thousands of years would be much easier to test and far less contaminated compared to the Shroud. They would be much less prone to accumulate contaminates, C14 isotopes etc; verse the Shroud. A Shroud, which has been handled, moved around, and kept in numerous ‘unknown’ containers and enviromental conditions for hundreds if not thousands of years. A Shroud which has also been “undoubtably contaminated” by centuries of incense and candle smoke, and plain old pollution. Moreover, and must be mentioned; being exposed to ‘extreme’ heat in possibly ‘several’ fires? and/or atleast one well known fire, which would have immersed the cloth in 900+ degree temperatures? There is no comparison whatsoever with the Shroud and most all other C14 items ever tested.It is also well understood in the C14 world that porous materials, such as linen, are extremely prone to contamination and all experts agree; is by far the most difficult to clean and test accurately…Take for instance in the cases of mummy wrappings (sealed for millenia no less); the wrappings have dated much younger then the bodies themselfs, and in a couple of cases with dates in disagreement exceeding 1000+ years! …Let’s get real here, radiocarbon dating is not infallible, far from it, it cannot be relied upon to give reliably accurate dates, ON IT’S OWN, and is very subceptible to errors due to unknown contaminations…This is not only a reality but a FACT, even with today’s technical advancements.

I am presently trying to find these architectural drawings I referred to, so I may strengthen my point, but it may take awhile as it was years ago that I studied the topic.R","date":"August 24, 2012 at 11:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/23/scholarly-incompetence-or-dishonesty/","cat":"history","title":"Scholarly Incompetence or Dishonesty?"},{"author":"ron","post":"Sorry Lyfe but your NOT getting the point, first of all I don’t think Yannick has in any way refutted any of Wilson’s arguments.

Faced with examples of Vignon markings, from catacomb art, of the fourth century, Jones, at the end of the comments postings, suggested that the Shroud was copied in Antioch in the fourth century. (Stephen Jones prefers the Markwardt’s Antioch theory over Wilson’s Edessa theory for the early hiding of the Shroud.)The presence of Vignon markings in earlier Christian and imperial art has always been a problem for Wilson’s theory of the copying of the Shroud in the sixth century.I was amazed how limited Vignon’s examination of the Shroud was- an hour with a group of others at midnight and ten minutes in the open air when there was a crowd around it-not much time for a scholarly assessment!How long does one need to indentify markings? Especially if you already know ‘exactly’ what you are looking for and where? …I would suspect less then a minute, two or three at the most? The point is; the question has been answered, as in, Vignon DID actually view the Shroud in real-life at various ranges and in various ‘lighted’ conditions. He was allowed a 10 minute private viewing, what more does one need!! Your nit-picking is just rediculous.I don’t think the catacomb frescos show any ‘discernable’ Vignon markings to tell you the truth and I have studied them closely. The parted hair and some facial similarities may occur, but not much of anything in the sense of the Vignon markings. The similarities could simply be due to Jesus’s appearence being brought down through word of mouth, nothing else. Furthermore these catacomb depictions were not wide-spread and it is very unlikely many people would be viewing frescos painted deep in the catacombs, very unlikely! Most all ‘wide-spread’ renditions of Jesus up to the 6th century were still of a youthfull appollo type figure.

So Jones accepts that the Vignon markings are in place by then which presumably fits with his fourth century date for the copying. Does Wilson include this image among his own study of the subject as one of those influenced by the Shroud?First of all, Vignon was studying these ‘markings’ WELL before he viewed the Shroud, so it is a big yes to him knowing ‘exactly ‘ what to look for. So again I’ll repeat; only minutes would be required to substantiate his findings!…Furthermore; some of the markings are apparenttly from faults in the weave or banding or whatever, but not of the image itself! So they would be noticeable moreso then the image itself. So I see no reason Vignon should be questioned on this or his integrity questioned.Secondly; Stephen Jones is allowed his interpretations, just as well as anyone else, but I think you may be wrong in what he concluded from the Christ Pantocrator in Ravenna which is ‘actually’ dated as late as 547 ad. Which puts it right inline with the discovery of the cloth in Edessa. So not the 5th century but the mid-6th.

As it was never established ‘conclusively’, it was created by the so called “Master of Sant Appolinare”. This was just speculation and conjecture…It is just as ‘likey’ the mosaic which is of a ‘Byzantine style’ was created years later, after Justinian I had secured Italy into his empire. Lets not forget it is well agreed that it was Justinian I who in ‘most likelyhood’ commissioned the making of the Pantocrator image and had commissioned the one at St Catherine’s in the Sinai, at relatively the same time period…Is this scenario speculation? Absolutely yes, but more logical and plausible then scenarios put forth by the two of you.Oh and by the way Wilson’s hypothsis to the dating i.e; ‘discovery’ of the Edessa cloth?

When they reached the cross some time later, they pulled this cloth off his body. Pulling this cloth off the body would have undoubtedly opened up many of the wounds again. Maybe not all, but many. ” Re-opened” wounds tend to take forever to close up again or to stop oozing, in my experience, and is a simple answer to all the blood or exudate of blood found from the scourge wounds.Like David Goulet mentioned above, I like the idea of God sending rain to cleanse the body of Christ, but, it would not explain the absence of dirt on the body by the time they had reached the tomb! If we take the studies on the Sudarium somewhat, and scriptures into account, and maybe a little common sense, Jesus hung on the cross for some time ‘after death’ and before taken down. He was then laid on the ground for a period of time, (possibly in the removal of the nails and/or from the cross). They did not have cobblestone or tiled ground, it was dirty/sandy or possibly muddy  ground! He would have been covered in a excessive amount of dirt with no doubt. Enough dirt to cover most, if not all the body. Hence I still believe a ‘PARTIAL’ washing is evident. Washing does not necessarily mean scrubbing/ wiping, washing would have been a delicate procedure of ‘dabbing’ with a wet sponge or other cloth, which would be essential if trying to avoid lifeblood in the procedure.

Your statement that Wilson overlooked that both Yeshua’s burial cloth (the Shroud?) and the Byssus face-veil (Vof M?) can be folded four/four times (doubled in four?) onto themselves, needs clarifying also. Are you talking about Wilson’s Tetradiplon (doubled in four) hypothesis? Because if you are, I would say there is no problem! As Wilson’s hypothesis states and has been shown (technically), and most probable, that the Shroud can be folded in this way and show the complete face image, impossible to do so with the VoM or anyother veil being held anywhere.As for the VoM I for one do not believe it is authentic and most likely a medieval work of art. Mind you an incredibly ingenious one! Reasons being that pigment, or what appears as pigment has been found on the image areas, and yes I am aware of some touch-ups that have been found, but these are a different issue. Secondly, and this is strictly my laymen’s opinion; Looking at the VoM image just seems to me to be not a natural image, but an artist’s rendition.

The problem is that be seems to go far beyond the cautious findings of Byzantine scholarship and develops theories largely on his own initiative.Ron : “One does not have to be an historian or a scholar to understand simple things like why the Shroud of Christ ‘IMAGE’ was not mentioned in scriptures or by early church fathers, atleast not openly mentioned.”I beg to differ, Ron. These seem to be to be very complex scholarly issues- the world of early images, as no doubt you will know from your close reading of the work of Hans Belting- is a very difficult area.I don’t think the ‘antiShroud community’ as you persist in calling them, insist that the Carbon14 dating is carved in stone. Most of them are independent scholars and have the natural caution of scholars. A typical position might be be that a medieval dating (perhaps some decades earlier than 1250 if there was genuine contamination that affected the date) is the most likely possibility but needs further work on it. As I understand Christopher Ramsey from Oxford ,et, al, it is that there is enough debate to justify a re-resting but Ramsey still, as I understand it, thinks a medieval date will be the result again. The issue rather is that no one has come up with any evidence that a renewed Carbon -14 dating is likely to come up with a first century dating.Until they do, a preferred date somewhere in the Middle Ages is likely to have most of the scholarly consensus, not because these scholars are rabid atheists but because they are scholars working on the balance of probabilities from the evidence they have.The ‘Wilson’ hypothesis is one thing, but don’t go talking crap with the c14 dating. YES the anti-shroud crowd take the c14 results as if they were FACT or written in stone, otherwise there would be very few arguments over the Shroud. I could care less what Prof Ramsey has to say has he was part of the original c14 fiasco, why would anyone take his word for anything? You should study radiocarbon dating and the method followed during the 1988 testing in depth, especially if you re-iterate comments as in; “but Ramsey still, as I understand it, thinks a medieval date will be the result again” and “Balance of probabilities from evidence they have” ..What evidence? A screwed up C14 dating?

Let me enlighten you to some facts about linen…It is widely known that; Linen is stronger wet then dry. Flax fibers and yarns increase about 20% in strength on wetting, resulting in greater longevity compared to most all other fabrics.Silica, present in linen flax fibrels protects linen from rotting. Linen is highly hydroscopic, meaning it is capable of absorbing moisture as well as dispelling moisture quite quickly. Linen is naturally insect repellant. Finally linen is ‘known’ for it’s “spectacular” durability.Linen samples are of the oldest of material fabrics ever found; 6000 year old Egyptian samples in almost prestine condition have been found. 8000 yr old samples in Peru. Linen fibrels found in a ‘cave’ in what is today Georgia dated “36,000 years old” still intact! …and many more examples. The Shroud we know, most definately, spent much of it’s time encased and very well cared for. So to think it could not survive 2000 years is simply unstudied conjecture to say the least.The ‘raking’ light photos of the Shroud and subsequent fold marks found and studied by Dr Jackson et al. along with a working model of a lift built by Jackson et al, and most likely the same used in Constatinople to raise the Shroud each Friday, is near indisputable. As the ‘evidence’ points exactly to this, along with the equal folds found which show at one time the Shroud was folded in eight where the face alone would show and in a ‘landscape’ style, reminiscent of many artist depictions of the Mandylion or Image of Edessa….This is very strong evidence, which cannot be easily dispelled.From your last statement, it dawns on me that you may have never actually read Wilson’s books or better yet his most recent book on the Shroud, as it will cut your last statement to ribbons.Ron","date":"April 23, 2012 at 2:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/16/yannick-i-said-it-before-and-ill-say-it-again-ian-wilson-is-wrong/","cat":"history","title":"Yannick: I said it before and I’ll say it again: Ian Wilson is Wrong"},{"author":"ron","post":"Yannick Clément :Ron, have you read all my good arguments against Wilson’s hypothesis ?

Whether they had to place the items in the Shroud or left them strewn in the tomb is unknown to me. Maybe someone with better knowledge can answer that question. Personally I think it is more logical that these items would have been placed with the deceased directly and not just left lying around.I also would like to say that from the posts above and hearing no rebuttal from Yannick, that no one caught my last post on this topic (More on the freeing of HAL9000).As for the thoughts that the items being placed in the Shroud and them having not enough time is hogwash…The burial tomb was situated in a garden! flowers were easily accessible!…Anyone would have had coins on them, especially a rich man. Scriptures do say he had just purchased the burial cloth. Also how much time would these placements take? Seriously? A few minutes maybe? The reasoning for such items as the coins and flowers being there at all, I mentioned in my last post and the reasoning seems quite logical to me. Sure they may have been rushed but basic things needed to be done. I also see no reason why the coins would need to be removed on the Sunday or the flowers for that matter, and if so, so what? Another thing scriptures were not clear on is how many people actually went to the tomb, I would think several people had gone; so lots of folk helping to prepare the rushed burial seems logical and could explain getting everything done quickly. So you see not so simple or illogical.Yannick your statement that the images seem to be ‘feeling’ instead of reason is completely off the mark. Specialists have seen these images, not thought they have.The coins are a perfect example, they show up in all 3d images of the face! Maybe not clear, but something is definately there. How do you explain the typo error seen/found on the coin image, which was not even known about until the coins were seen on the Shroud? …Anyways I don’t really want to get into it too far either, like you, but think about it, Is it logical or scientific to say all these artifacts are not there just because you don’t see them? …I agree with you that much more study is warranted and maybe the new hd images and more chemical  studies will shed some light on this topic in particular.Don’t get me wrong here, I don’t see any of the artifacts when I look at pictures of the Shroud either, but I have seen some ‘things’ in VP image photos, but not conclusively knowing what they are. Some people with direct access and scrutiny of the Shroud, much more then we have ever had, say they have sen these things…So who are we to say they are not there or they are wrong?It’s closed minded, unscientific and just plain wrong to refute any so-called findings until ‘ALL’ possible studies have been done.

No one can hold both hypotheses together. And because Adler tell us that the blood on the Shroud really show all the characteristics of exudates of blood clots, I don’t know why we should still consider Zugibe’s hypothesis as a plausible explanation for the transfer of the scourge marks. By the way, if Zugibe was right about that, then can you explain to me why there are absolutely no smudges on the cloth, especially in the back region where a high pressure was present because of the weight of the body? Seriously, that just doesn’t sound right at all and, also, such an hypothesis doesn’t even consider Adler’s solid conclusions about the blood. So, I think it’s time to say: goodbye to Zugibe’s hypothesis of a partial washing of the body!All the data and observation coming from the Shroud really seem to indicate that the corpse was rapidly laid down in the cloth and that it was still covered of blood clots and dirt, while there was probably enough time between the death and the entombment for a complete drying of the sweat on the skin and in the hair… These data and observation are TOTALLY CONSISTENT with the Gospel accounts. That’s pretty amazing to note.I have no issue with that. My position has always been that Zugibe is only partially right in his assurtions. I believe the body may have been only partially washed and a clue is the fact there is no dirt on the body, except for a few well known areas; heel of the foot, knees and nose; Where is all the dirt?. Jewish customs did not allow ‘life-blood’ to be washed off the body, that is where I believe Zugibe makes his error. But even a partially washed body, carefully avoiding any lifeblood areas, and immediately encased in a Shroud could possibly re-moisten the main blood encrustations.R","date":"March 18, 2013 at 3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/17/scorching-theory-pseudoscience-or-miracle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorching Theory: Pseudoscience or Miracle?"},{"author":"ron","post":"Good points Yannick, although it falls on deaf ears.

It is very unlikely one could manage the burden of carrying and clutching simultaneously, hense three persons for sure. Most likely Joseph, Nichodemus and John.

If the image was a scorch it would have to have been ‘extremely’ light scorching. But the back-lit photos and decreasing intensity scorches seen on the Shroud, place this in extreme doubt. Even the very slightest of scorch marks on the shroud will block the light.

Your conclusion that the chance of coins being placed on the eyes during the hasty burial is “Very, Very Low” is nonsence. Period. It is an unsubstantiated claim. Time is not an issue, it would take only moments to place coins over the eyes, so that argument is mute. Ancient Jewish customs? Fact; Most all scholars admit they know very little to 1st century Jewish burial customs. Their information comes from 2nd century writings after the fall of the Jewish revolts and the dispersion of the Jewish people. Alot may have been lost or changed due to this. Fact; Placing coins over the eyes was not substantiated as a ‘Pagan’ practice or stricly used by pagan cultures. Fact; Archeaological findings (many), from 1st century tombs prove it was a ‘practice’ to place coins on the eyes, notice I say practice, not a custom. Fact; The Talmud mentions the need to ‘close the eyes’ of the deceased at burial Fact; protrusions are seen on the 3D renderings of the Shroud over the eyes.Some have seen, after intense study what may be writings and symbols matching that of 1st century coins precisly where these protrusions are found….We here on this Blog have had no chance to study so intensly or closely these findings, so how can we make judgement on them?

Okay lets break this down to your points; 1 ‘The blood marks are not smeared’ Okay so assuming they (Gnostics), used a tortured corpse, how could they possibly pull this off? If they used the corpse to create the image, how did they get the sheet off the corpse without leaving sweared blood or no blood so they may paint them? -if they somehow managed this, How did they imprint the blood marks themselfs on the sheet without any signs of brush strokes, blotching, directionality and with invisible to the eye sirum stains etc;~most unlikely and rediculous.2. “The image is highly detailed, as with a photograph or painting”- We know quite conclusively they didn’t have cameras in the first three centuries, so you would assume they ‘painted’ this? Then why a body? Have you ‘ever’ seen a painting with the detail this Shroud image has?, I haven’t and especially with 3D distance information! Furthermore if they had somehow used the body to create the image, you would have to assume these people had the ‘present’ knowledge of chemical  decomposition and the milliard reactions and would have known exactly when to pull the sheet off the body~again most unlikely and rediculous. 3 “The cloth is narrow and long and could serve no other purpose then to create a double image”, I could go on for hours on this statement alone, but lets keep it simple; That is one HUGH assumption. No other burial cloth from that era/local exists to this day, simply because they would have decayed very quickly, only remnants exist. So no clue as to thier size or style. Scriptures say “a burial sheet was purchased”, not sheets, so one may conclude this sheet was quite large. Furthermore if this long narrow sheet was not the proper burial garment, then why would some early century Gnostics use such a sheet to conjure a ‘hoax’? most preposturous. Wouldn’t their contemperaries question this? And why the double image? When a simple frontal image would surfice?….laughable.4. “It assumes the discovery of the empty tomb is an historical event…”  Do you have any proof that is wasn’t? Would the disciples make this up, when any contemporary could simply check it out for themselfs? No scholar to my knowledge with any credibility challenges the empty tomb, as all the writers mention it. You say “there are other sources of historical fact that the followers of Jesus swore up and down that he appeared to them after He died” so we are to pick and choose what is fact or fiction? Those same followers also stated the FACT that the tomb was empty~ no word for this ;-)Taking all the comments that have been put forth here by the present bloggers, I think it’s quite safe to say; It is a total illusion to think the Gnostics had anything whatsoever to do with this Shroud, that is my humble opinion.Ron","date":"December 2, 2011 at 8:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/02/was-the-shroud-of-turin-created-by-gnostics-continued/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Was the Shroud of Turin created by Gnostics? (Continued)"},{"author":"ron","post":"I wonder when was the last time Donald had his eyes checked?

How could they have removed the material from the body without disturbing the blood traces whatsoever? It has also been shown there is no image under the blood! This fact alone basically in a single swoop eliminates a forgery…imho. There are other numerous points against this type of forgery taking place; The travetine dirt found on the soul of the feet for one. Just too many little things are found on the Shroud that would never be considered by a forgerer. Including the very unconventional double image. I agree though with much of what Gabriel stated in his post no 10.Getting back on topic with why this man depicted on the shroud cannot be someone else, again I have to mention probabilities, such as been mentioned before; the head wounds reminiscent of an ‘eastern’ crown of thorns (Not a western medieval style crown), the side wound as opposed to the legs being broken!, the excessive scourging proceeding the cruxcifion!, which was not a common practice, as much as people think. The use of nails instead of rope. The plucked beard etc; …so many things, all meaning very little on their own but considered as a whole and considering first and formost the amazingly realistic image we see, proves to me there is no question of who left his markings on this sheet of linen.R..","date":"December 7, 2011 at 7:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/07/why-do-we-think-it-is-an-image-of-jesus-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think it is an image of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"ron","post":"Yannick Clément :Personally, I think John wrote this to state clearly that he saw with his own eyes Jesus dying on the cross ! At the time John wrote, there was probably already people who said that he didn’t die on the cross and that’s why the disciples saw him alive after ! I think that’s why John emphisize the spear episode : to say that it is certain that Jesus was dead when he was taking down from the cross and that he saw him alive after. And in the context of a Roman crucifixion that couldn’t last long because of the passover and the Sabbath, it is a procedure that must have been done from time to time to make sure that a victim was really dead before taking his body down from the cross. That’s why I say the spear wound is not an absolute proof that it is Jesus depicted on the Shroud. We cannot be certain that other criminal who died faster than normal on the cross didn’t received also this treatment before being taking down from the cross… But I agree with you that it must have been a pretty rare procedure because criminals didn’t died fast in a normal Roman crucifixion.Your reasoning for John’s mentioning of the lancing makes no sense! Your forgetting John ‘specifically’ mentions the others were clubed (crurifragium), breaking the legs. Why would John bother mentioning the clubing of the two thiefs at all then, if his only goal was to state clearly he witnessed Jesus’s death? Furthermore, John would not by any means have to prove to his contemporaries that Jesus was actually dead before taken from the cross. People then would know ‘quite well’ that the Roman soldiers and particularly the Centurian in charge, would make no mistake of it. As it would be a serious dereliction of duty, an offense punishable by death. These Roman crucifixion ‘teams’ were professionals and very experienced in their trade. So for the soldiers to allow Jesus to be taken down from the cross, everyone would be absolutely sure he had passed-on, no question. Therefore I think it makes more sense these details were written because John realized, afterward, that that specific lancing did in fact allow Jesus’s death to accomplish prophesy (no bones would be broken), and that in fact it was a rarity among crucifixions….And possibly because this ‘rare’ wound was one highly noticeable blood stain seen on the Shroud.

That is why I must point out something I do not agree with that both you and Gloria proposed concerning the SIDE WOUND! Let’s contemplate this; From my view although I agree the head wounds remeniscent of a crown of thorns is probably the most striking point towards this person being Jesus, the side wound is also. My thoughts; It is well known that MOST crucifixion victims were left on their crosses to rot, SOME were taken down because the Jewish law not permitting a Jew to hang over night on the Sabbath. Most scholars agree that in most all circumstances victims legs would be broken, no mention EVER of a victim being lanced to hasten death. Before you controedict my statement lets contemplate John 19:31. John makes it a point to mention the two thieves having thier legs broken and Jesus’s not, and ONLY because of the circumstance that Jesus was already dead! John wasn’t very specific about much of the crucifixion but specifically mentioned this very important point. Why? I think it was because he realized afterwards when writing his testiments this was a ‘specific’ point  and also because it adhered to scriptures. But maybe as John no doubt had witnessed many crucifixions, realized this particular act was specific to Jesus alone, hense why he was determined to make a ‘specific’ point to it.R","date":"December 14, 2011 at 11:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/07/why-do-we-think-it-is-an-image-of-jesus-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think it is an image of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"ron","post":"First, nice to see you on here again Maria :-)   “Why should the image be of Jesus and not someone else?”… I’ve heard this question asked many times. Alot of Shroud opponents will try this logic to sway people often…Too me personally, the first time I saw the image I had an overwhelming feeling or dare I say an “Instant recognition” that this was our Lord Jesus. The image was so imazing, so real and even with my very limited knowledge at the time of the Shroud, I knew in my heart it could not be man made. Why not someone else? Logically, I think it comes down to probabilities. Probabilities such as; Why would anyone save a burial shroud?, as it was against Jewish law to do so. Why does it still exist and been faithfully preserved and venerated for two millenia? How many people in history suffered the exact same afflictions as the man on the Shroud?, and as depicted in scriptures occurred to Jesus during his crucifixion! There is a great video on the website; Shroudtv.com and under the heading ‘Identity’, where you have Prof Bruno Barberis explaining ‘Calculus of probability’ and how it scientifically provides strong evidence that the man on the Shroud can logically and thru the use of mathematics only be one man and that man is the historical Jesus.R.","date":"December 7, 2011 at 12:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/07/why-do-we-think-it-is-an-image-of-jesus-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think it is an image of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"ron","post":"Dan there is another probability in your statement, the fact that this ‘crucifixion’ victim was buried period! and not just thrown into a common grave, as it is well known was more common.

The fact that we have a burial shroud also goes as evidence to the empty tomb, whereas if someone had ‘stolen’ the body and disposed of it or buried it, wouldn’t they have kept it wrapped in the Shroud? Why seperate the Shroud from the body in this case? Especially considering it would be covered in blood. This was a big no-no occording to Jewish law in that no unclean thing must be touched.

I think that’s what Marcel Alonso meant by comparing the Shroud with a flower. This and also the fact that, like a flower, even though the image on the Shroud is not reproducible, that surely don’t mean it necessarily come from the Resurrection of Christ directly (or indirectly as a by-product). I agree with Alonso’s point of view.Yannick I really don’t think anyone here has ever stated that because the image cannot be reproduced, as of yet, that it must then be from a resurrection event. But if you take all the evidence gathered to this point, into consideration, I think it may be quite difficult to argue against it actually being so. The whole point against the 100 shroud hypothesis is that it would be very very unlikely that a burial shroud would ever be removed from a victim, especially in 1st century Judea. I agree with you that the chances the Shroud is a fake is practically zero. I also agree that we can not say for sure that it was not some natural chemical occurance that caused the image, but when one gathers all the evidence and coincidences to scripture together, one finds it hard to go against a miraculous event.

There was a term, a specific word used; (It escapes me now), but the term could mean the (hands, wrists or lower forearms). So it is not so clear of the exact point of entry. But in saying that I think people have used this “depiction of early art” mistakingly in Shroud science to prove it’s worth. Although the depiction on the Shroud does show an anatomically correct EXIT point of the nail wounds, it does not eliminate the entry in the palms or the depiction of such in early psintings. As it is quite possible the nails were placed into the palms on an angle which would exit where we see so on the Shroud.(Zugibe). The entry of the nails into the palms would have undoubtably been brought down by word of mouth thru the ages as that is what was ‘seen’, as no one could see the backs of the wrists or the wound exits…So the depictions were not in error, quite the opposite they were correct in what was ‘seen’ by onlookers of the crucifixion. That does not take anything away from the undeniable anatomical truth shown on the Shroud of the exit wounds, but only strengthens it’s claim to authenticity.As for the feet, it is in ‘my opinion’ while taking close observation of the feet/ankle/leg ‘angles’ seen on the Shroud and in taking into account the observance that the body is in extreme rigor: The feet could not have been placed flat on the verticle beam of the cross! Therefore it is most likely that a footrest of sorts is evident. This would also make sense in that the victim would have something to push against when raising himself to breath, otherwise the force of such raising would undoubtably be very difficult without!…Again the Shroud details shine in it’s authenticity.Your last paragraph is full of misconceptions; The Shroud most definitely does not go against biblical scriptures accounts when it comes to the what you state; for one the scriptures do not mention a “wound around cloth”, it states a linen was ‘BOUND’ or to bind, not neccessarily wound around. The separate cloth over the face has been delt with many times and is simple to grasp; The head was originally covered by a Sudarium, this Sudarium was removed in the tomb, then the complete body was bound in the Shroud as depicted by the image on the Shroud…You must read up on the Sudarium of Oviedo and read the scriptures more closely as John does state; :”the cloth that HAD BEEN about his head”…As for the washing; it would have been against Jewish custom to wash the body of a ‘victim of violence’ or of a ‘criminal’, as stated in the burial laws of the Jews.Someone once stated to Barrie Schwortz; “But the Shroud is too perfect to be true”, Barrie responded; “If it was anyless perfect would you accept it?” the person responded with a resounding “No”… ;-)R","date":"January 7, 2012 at 1:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/02/thermo-stenciling-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thermo-Stenciling the Shroud of Turin?"}],"misc":[{"author":"ron","post":"Oops, that link should read as; http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.ca/   sorry for the error.","date":"March 27, 2012 at 11:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/25/a-guest-posting-by-jabba-rich-savage/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Guest Posting by “Jabba” (Rich Savage)"},{"author":"ron","post":"Good luck Jabba, you’ve got quite the task ahead of you.

I know some people think that I can fall myself into that kind of trap, but if those people could see how many times I’ve changed my mind over the years on many different topics regarding the Shroud, I don’t think they would have that kind of opinion of me no more. I don’t think that defending passionately a rational quest for truth regarding the Shroud (while taking into account ALL the data we know about this object), I don’t think it can be called “fanatism”. I prefer to think it’s more like a defense of the integrity of Shroud research. And, I said it before, I’m not here to make friends but to seek the truth (which, again, is something totally different). I don’t want to fall into one rigid group where all the people should think the same. That’s what I call “fanatism”.Problem is Yannick, although you may believe you are being scientific or ‘rational’, you aren’t.

It is a hypothesis and accepted as so, nothing more.

As they would have been dry for hours.”On this particular topic, I say again to you : Read Barbet’s book again !!! For him, the transfer on the cloth occured because those dried blood clots get humidified again on their surface because of the aqueous environment in which the body was exposed inside the Shroud. I submit to your attention that this aqueous environment hypothesis can be linked to the image formation hypothesis of Rogers ! For Barbet, it is clear, a dead body can emit water vapors and that could have been enough to re-humidified the blood clots that were over the scourge wounds, so that a mirror image of those wounds could occured. To this water vapor, I think we can also add the very probable ammoniac gas that could have come out of the body (maybe of every part of the skin, because of a deposit of urea coming from the dried sweat), along other possible amine gas coming from every pores of the skin. All those different gas could have been well enough to create the aqueous environment proposed by Barbet.When you look carefully at the nature of the blood stains on the Shroud (the fact that most of them don’t come from liquid blood and the fact that most of them have a serum halo present around them), I have to say that this is really, by far, the most logical and viable hypothesis (scientifically speaking) that I’ve ever read to explain the presence and the nature of the scourge marks on the Shroud.You didn’t read close enough Yannick, Barbet’s ideas may have a possibility of being correct when dealing with the blood clotted dumbbell areas or larger wounds, but it requires alot of suppositions to reach likelihood, and definately is much more reaching to explain the fine definition of the WELTS. Another thing you missed is that the scourge marks in all probability, would be completely dry, possibly even at the preliminary stages of scabbing, as it would have been many hours that had passed since the scourging-approximately 10 hours or more and in open air!.Ron","date":"March 24, 2012 at 6:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"author":"ron","post":"Actually reading on the topic of the 2002 restoration, apparently they did vacuum the cloth, in co-ordinated (sections) and have categorized and sealed all materials taken.

Ask yourself; How many people were present to accomplish this ritual? And what did the Jewish laws state about ‘Eve of Sabbath’ burials’? Then tell us which is more likely.”I would answer : Most probably, a hasty partial burial because, Ron, you forget one important fact : the burial of Jesus wasn’t prepared at all !!!! First, nobody beside Judas knew that Jesus would be arrested on thurday night and at that time, nobody knew that he would be crucified. And when he was crucified, nobody knew that his body could be buried normally in a normal tomb and not thrown into a common grave with the other victims. When it was clear that the body could be buried in the tomb of Joseph, what time do you think it was ??? Much more than 3 o’clock of the afternoon for sure ! That doesn’t left many time to buy or found a decent shroud and buy or prepared aloes and myrrh (probably in some solid form) to put around the body to avoid bad odors on Sunday morning…And if we take into account the experiments and conclusions of the Spanish team of sindonologists on the Sudarium of Oviedo, they say that it took around 2 hours after death before the body could reach the tomb ! And if we take into account the Gospels, they say that the women did return on Sunday morning to finish the burial.All those clues point in one direction : a hasty partial burial. I don’t see why they would have do anything on Friday except putting the body into the Shroud and putting aloes and myrrh in bags all around the body (maybe inside the shroud) to avoid the bad odors on Sunday morning, and then rolling the great stone to close the entrance of the tomb. Why losing time on other things (like the washing of the body for example) in a context where the Sabbath and the Passover feast were about to start and while they knew all along that, no matter what, they had to come back on Sunday morning ?You didn’t manage to answer one of my questions, at all…nothing!. You just managed to repeat points I intorduced to time interval, as to the Sudarium conclusions!….Answer the specific questions Yannick.Your also a little dillusional if you think there are absolutely no signs of even a ‘partial washing’ my friend. Remember one point; Jesus, from the 140+ wounds he suffered; his body would have been almost completely covered in blood, that means all surfaces….So why only blood be only in some areas and not all surfaces such as the torso or arms legs completely? …If humidity, or sweat, or whatever was the cause?R","date":"March 30, 2012 at 6:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/23/is-it-reasonable-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"science","title":"Is it Reasonable to Believe in the Resurrection?"},{"author":"ron","post":"Most of those publications you mention, talk about other Shrouds, however there were and are no other Shrouds, only the Shroud we know as the Shroud of Turin.

But what mechanism precisely? And what is the nature of the image in that different mechanism? Why not admit it – you don’t have one, because none of those airy-fairy mechanisms that involve something other than direct scorching ever specify the chemical nature of the image, far less the process by which such an image came to be formed without a credible source of radiation, or an imaging system (converging lens etcMy theory may be wrong, but it at least specifies the source of energy (thermal), the method of heat transfer (conduction), the chemical nature of the scorch (semi-pyrolysed cellulose and/or other carbohydrates). What’s more, it totally rules out any kind of imprinting at a distance. Heat conduction requires that two bodies be directly in contact, i.e. with a zero air gap.Sorry, Gabriel, but you have failed to make any point or objection that advances the SCIENTIFIC debate.If you want to be scientific, then try to falsify the conduction model. But I don’t envy you that task (given that the model can be verified in the kitchen at home, to give an image with “3D-encoded information” using a free downloadable bit of software off the internet).Except for  a couple of non-relevant and accusational comments made towards those with previous studies of the Shroud, I find Bod’s recent comments seem to have a slight trend to a more serious study of the Shroud, which I may add is refreshing. Now for Bod’s assumption that this image was created by conduction from possibly a metal sculpture; Understanding I am no physics expert by any means but I have plenty of knowledge when it comes to metal working; I think Bod must consider IF a bronze or whatever metal was used; How possibly did they manage “uniform” temperatures across the whole surface of the relief or statue and also manage “uniform” .0002 image depth across both ventral and dorsal images? All metals, except ‘maybe’ very highly refined types will show ‘hot spots’ when heated. To me this FACT alone counts out any type of bas-relief method, not to mention the basically impossible notion that someone could place uniform ‘pressure’ throughout the whole surface of the cloth within a finite amount of time to create the image we see. We would need an expert in metallurgy, with unmatched skill in sculpturing, surpassing even the likes Michelangelo and with an unpresedented knowledge in physics and a dexterity only matched by a computer controlled machine to “pull-off” such an amazingly realistic image.

You make some good points, let me give you a ‘possible’ explanation(s) for some or all of these ‘artifacts’ being present on the Shroud. Following scripture; I, for one do not believe they were in that much of a rush as most conclude, has apparently Jesus died at approximately 3pm, another 2 hours or so passed before they actually took him down and carried him off to the tomb. That would give them probably one or possibly nearly two hours before the moon dropped below the horizon, hense starting the Passover (If I’ve calculated properly). In that time, much can be accomplished! Lets look at it from the view of the persons actually preparing Jesus after they reached the tomb. They, knowing very well that somone would have to come back on the Sunday to complete the annointing/ritual. Time still allowed for possibly a partial wash to be performed (Zugibe), Jesus was then laid in the Shroud, flowers were placed with some spices, as they knew the body would definitely be emitting odours by Sunday and placing such items was done to possibly lesson or restrict the smell. The coins on the eyes were placed to keep the eyes closed and from some recent findings by archeologists, apparently this WAS a Jewish practice of the time, as coins have been found in skulls found in 1st century Jerusalem tombs. They then placed Jesus in the position we see by braking the rig of the arms, then improvised by cutting a strip from the shroud to tie him in position, possibly knowing that by Sunday rigor moris would be waning. All these things may have been done in light that the woman would be back and also done with their frail emotions/conditions in mind. Imagine the woman coming into the tomb on the Sunday to find the tomb wreaking of decay with the body sprawed unceremoniously and the eyes wide open! …What a frightning and horible scene that would be! …I think the ‘preparers’ would have more sense and sensitivity, then to leave things in that manner.Although alot of people do not put much faith in these ‘articles’ existing on the Shroud, we cannot just completely dismiss them also, just because we don’t ‘believe’ they are there. That my friend also is not very open minded or scientific either. Until further, more complete and exhaustive examinations are done on the Shroud with new technologies, I think IMHO, that it would be good to keep an open mind to all possibilities.Ron","date":"October 19, 2011 at 7:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/13/more-on-freeing-the-hal-9000-yes-what-is-the-archdiocese-of-turin-afraid-of/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on Freeing the HAL 9000: Yes, what is the Archdiocese of Turin afraid of?"},{"author":"ron","post":"Note a correction for the line above should read; That would give them one or possibly two hours before the moon RAISED ABOVE the HORIZON, hense starting the Passover.Sorry for the error….long night at work ;-)","date":"October 19, 2011 at 8:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/13/more-on-freeing-the-hal-9000-yes-what-is-the-archdiocese-of-turin-afraid-of/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"More on Freeing the HAL 9000: Yes, what is the Archdiocese of Turin afraid of?"},{"author":"ron","post":"I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m just in total awe at the amazing condition of the linen.R","date":"April 11, 2013 at 1:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"author":"ron","post":"Yannick Clément :I think there’s enough evidences in the Gospel of John to understand that this one is most probably the only one who was written by an eye-witness of the events of the Passion, death, entombment, the discovery of the empty tomb (and the empty Shroud !) and the apparitions of the risen Lord. And as a Shroudie Ron, I don’t understand how you can miss that !!! The Shroud of Turin is a proof that John was there and that he saw everything with his own eyes ! It’s particularly true for the violent scourging (done more violently than usual because Pilate thought that it would calm down the Jewish leaders and prevent Jesus from being crucified) and the lance stab done after death (only report in this gospel). And also, we should not neglect the fact that the author emphasize his testimony by the words : “The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.” (John 19, 35)Now, unless you think he’s a liar, I think this single statement is a proof that the writer of this Gospel (whether it was John the Apostle, John the Presbyter or another person) was there and that he really was a true disciple of Jesus. And if you don’t believe him when he clearly state that he was an eye-witness of the Passion, death, entombment, the discovery of the empty tomb (and the empty Shroud !) and the apparitions of the risen Lord, then, I really wonder how can you believe in the resurrection of Jesus !!!!First of all, why do you always respond to my comments using the quote feature?

So what you may see as “putting down anything and everything you can about the Shroud” is merely an attempt on my part to remain rational and objective about the nature of the imaging process etc, and not be seduced into thinking, for instance, that “encoded 3D information” is anything mysterious (recalling that the 1532 burn marks also show the same “encoded 3D information”).Your suggestion that my scorch experiment with the thermo-sensitizer and radiant heat (which incidentally I don’t think was employed to produce the Shroud, but still makes a point – that an image can be painted on without leaving brushmarks, indeed leaving nothing except a scorch) needs peer review is redundant. I have shownstep-by-step photographs showing how it was done which anyone can reproduce in their homes. As for your “schoolboy experiment” dig, you may be interested to know that I predicted the outcome before designing the experiment – based on the scientific premise that a painted-on black pigment would selectively absorb heat and light rays to produce scorching of the cloth restricted to the painted area.

So when you make statements such as; “The TRUE fact is your (and others’) interpretation (as opposed to Saint Augustine’s, mine or Meacham’s) is clearly contrary to John 20: 8 LITERAL meaning” -It just turns my stomach. How can you be so sure your interpretation is right? or infact FACT?John would have choosen his words very carefully, so for him to use ‘believe’ would have been non-climatic, if talking about the woman. So he believed the woman were right in what they assumed? Still makes no sense, as he would have been ‘absolutely sure’ they were telling the truth and not a ‘tall tale’ at that point. So the usage of the word ‘believe’ is contrary to what he absolutely was sure of at that precise moment. Your comments ‘theorizing’ or ‘sole funerary arched bench’ are simply made up also. When Peter entered the tomb he ‘beheld’ (theOrei) what he saw. When John entered the tomb he ‘perceived’ (eiden) what he saw and believed. Meaning, as I intepret it, that Peter was dumbfounded and could not register in his mind what he was seeing, whereas John saw the condition of the linens and the Sudarium and understood (believed) immediately what must have occured, for up to that moment he did not understand that Jesus would rise from the dead and fulfill scriptures. That ‘to me’ is seems like the most  propable and logical interpretation.Yes Max, I tend to disagree with your hypothesis when it comes to Jesus’s appearance to Mary at the tomb, as I have an issue with Jesus still wearing a dirty, bloodied 14ft sheet as an himation or article of clothing…I would tend to believe the Shroud was left in the tomb for the apostles to find!

I am quite sure you have experienced this in your life-time Max, countless times no less. Moreover; Being we know from scripture the tomb was situated in a garden, she maybe just assumed it was the gardener which approached her, and when he first spoke, it didn’t dawn on her it was the Lord as she would not expect to hear his voice, but when he spoke her name, she recognized him completely as would be expected, since she heard this many, many times before.

That would be a clincher that the body had been taken don’t you think? As I can’t see anyone stealing the body without it….thats all I have to say. Also as I said previously we are NOT talking about the ‘other’ times Jesus appeared to the deciples, just this one appearance, so NO I have not stated that in the other appearances everyone was blinded by the Sun….lets please stick to the one topic at hand and don’t put words in my mouth. My statement on the Mary Magdelena appearance, as I stated quite clearly was just an extremely speculative hypothesis in answer to your extremely speculative statements Max. Now to this comment you made to Yannick on his thoughts about the deciples not investigating and just going home; “Had you carefully really read the Gospels, you would have found the answer to your spurrious question: the disciples were instructed by Yeshua (via the women) to meet him in Galilee after the event (‘Go and tel my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me” (28:9-10)…” -My response would be; If you had read the Gospels properly Max, you would realize, they left and went home (without any ‘research’ as Yannick stated) before Jesus appeared to Mary and before she went and told the deciples anything!…please get your chronology in order.Now to this comment by you Max; “To the sole exception of Mary of Magdalene who did see Yeshua alive in body and flesh in Joseph’s garden, if you really can read the Greek version of the Gospels and carefully read them you honestly cannot but admit none of the disciples believed Yeshua had resurrected till he appeared to them and opened their minds to what is written in the Scriptures” -This may be your and others mis-interpretation Max. I interpret the Greek as John at that precise moment of perception ‘believed’ Jesus had risen, not ‘KNEW’. He was not absolutely 100% sure, but believed so, from what he just witnessed, and notice also; he states only ‘he’ believed and not that ‘they’ believed, as in Peter believing so also!… Later that evening he would be ‘sure’ when Jesus appeared to them in the room. Hense the reason he used the term ‘believed’, and the reason he would NOT “Implore the reader to believe” as you say at that time.

It would seem to me it was quite obvious the woman were right and he would have found that out immediately upon entering the tomb. It seems more probable the use of the word believe was to some other ‘notion’. Could it not have dawned on him, at that precise moment, all the things Jesus had said to them in the past and he put it all together that Jesus had risen?

But I do have some approx. 2 month old blood (mine) that I spotted onto linen a while ago that is now mellowing nicely (now more brown than red in colour). There is a pronounced series of parallel ribs on the top side of my linen, but unlike the Shroud, my blood has not confined itself to the crowns of those ribs (why should it?) and is instead distributed fairly evenly between ribs and intervening furrows – exactly as one might expect a liquid to do.Everyone is agreed (I think) that the Shroud image is mainly on the most superficial part of the linen, i.e. the crowns, with different explanations being offered (I say it is due to scorching by direct contact; Rogers explained it in terms of impurities that concentrate on the highest points through capillarity and evaporation, where they then react with his volatile body-decomposition amines). Why should blood concentrate on the crowns of ribs, given it has particulate red blood cells, and given its tendency to clot quite quickly?Are you thinking what I am thinking? Probably not, but then you are not a sceptical scientist. In fact you said earlier you are glad you were not a scientist (while prepared it seems to believe SOME scientists who say those spots are blood, even though in some cases their comments were hedged around with caveats).I think it highly improbable that a series of dark parallel lines on linen, distinguishable from other image areas only in intensity, represents blood. It is no more blood than those parts of the image that we interpret as “hair”, which also images along the ribs with no sign of any independent strand-like appearance. In other words, we “see” hair, we see “blood” at the macroscopic level, but there is nothing at the microscopic level to suggest that real blood, or real hair ever came into contact with the linen.First of all Colin; Did you have the Misses, whip and torture you first? Or maybe if you were suffering from Jondice, before you drew blood? Otherwise, your blood on linen experiment is basically worthless…Thats just to start….Two; I don’t know how you can say the blood is only on the crowns of the threads, it seems and looks to me like much of the blood in the image you linked too above is in the furrows, maybe some on the crowns, but mostly in the furrows. I think it would be expected that over the centuries alot of the blood traces on the crowns could have been lost due to the innumerable times it has been folded, or rolled up and unfurled.

For the speculation question Ron, I want you to read my posts again ! I’ve clearly said that Zugibe’s hypothesis can be true, but like many questions regarding the Shroud, since we’re left with hypothesis and speculations (as you say), then we must judge what hypothesis has more chance to be close to the reality. And the best way to judge between 2 different hypothesis is, as I said before, to used the Occam razor principle. And, as I said before, when we used this principle, Barbet’s hypothesis reach a higher point in a probabilistic scale than Zugibe’s hypothesis, just because his description of the way of nailing the victims hands to the cross is much more simplier and more easy to do. That’s all I said. I never pretend Zugibe’s hypothesis is 100% off-track. I just say that Barbet’s hypothesis seem more simple and easy to do in the context of a Roman crucifixion. In other word, the way Barbet describe the nailing of the wrist (and don’t forget that he made real experiments of nailing a dead body) seem more “natural” than Zugibe’s hypothesis, and don’t forget also that the outcome is the same : the wrist is completely locked and the victim cannot remove his hands from the cross, even if he pull hard with his arms.I’m pleased that you were able to read his book and yes, it would surely be a good thing to read it again because it is brilliant and very interesting from a forensic point of view !For the Stigmata topic, read the answer I gave to Chris below. Tomorrow, I’ll write Barbet’s opinion about that, which is very interesting.You never bonified anything, and you never claimed Zugibe’s hypothesis can be true, you basically attacked him with speculations of jealousy and lack of knowledge compared to Barbet etc;Let me point a couple of very intriquing points to you and I expect you to be honest; One -Destot’s point is not actually in the wrist! but technically, in the boney part of the ‘palm’! Two- look close at the exit wound on the Shroud, does it look like the wound is anyway near the desot’s point?…Absolutely NOT! . Anyone with eyes can see that…I see it clearly! Three- the nerve we speak of does not even run thru the area Barbet suggested but closer to the thumb and the thickness of a Roman nail would most likely never touch the nerve as the nerve is too small. But the most important point is the location of the wound!…Look at some pictures of the Shroud wound and also anatomy pictures depicting the running of the nerve and where destot’s spot actually is, and notice it is not where the destot’s spot is, it is too close to the thumb side….Oh one more point I noticed; You talk about a simpler way and the nail going in at 90 degrees; Look at the wound opening and picture a nail striking straight thru; Where would it come out the other side?

Sometimes one must read between the lines… Even though it cannot be stated ‘precisely’ that the Aragonite found on the Shroud are from the tombs surrounding Jerusalem, one must recognise it is definately not the type found anywhere in Continental Europe either!

If Kohlbeck in his paper simply lies regarding the origin of the spectra he shows, why should we believe him in his conclusions? I hate to put things this way but honestly, it is exactly the point where we are regarding the aragonite issue. However, I am open to other points of view because perhaps I am missing something…… In my view, if everything around the aragonite could be confirmed independently in a more scientific way, the authenticity of the Shroud could be firmly established.As to your last statement; Isn’t that the case for many issues with the Shroud?

Daveb also has a point in that either scenario may be tenable when it comes to the tomb narrative. Translation of the scriptures is a sticky point when dealing in such matters. I tend to disagree with Augustine’s interpretation and feel it tends to run along the lines that the apostles or in this case in particular, John, were idiots. To me, John at that precise moment, after viewing the status of the burial cloths knew exactly what had occured and as Jesus had told them he would rise again on the third day. The other apostles still hiding were not prevy to this knowledge and possibly didn’t believe John either when he got back and told them. It is quite reasonable to assert that when Jesus appeared to the disciples in the room that evening, John was already fully aware and a believer of Jesus’s resurrection, yet not the others.I have an issue with Davebs’ assertion, in the possiblility of the image being ‘noticed’ in the tomb on that Easter morning, as the image would have been on the inside of the Shroud (if the Shroud was left exactly as before), and not noticeable at that particular time.

You look at it with your eyes of modern faithful who had time to assimilate the concept of the Resurrection of Christ… On Easter morning, when the tomb (and the Shroud) was found empty, I’m not sure that there was even one disciple to believe in Jesus Resurrection before he appeared to them and they could see him alive again (even though what they saw was surely a bit different than the image of the dead Jesus we can see on the Shroud, since they had trouble to recognize him).But in the end, who knows? Maybe John was much more clairvoyant than the rest of the group… It is possible but, in the face of the rest of the Gospel stories related to Jesus Resurrection, I have a serious doubt about that. Surely, Thomas was not the only one who needed to see in order to believe… This is part of human nature I guess.I think careful reading of the scriptures is warranted and that YOUR commonsense is waining.,The Apostles had no problem whatsoever ‘recognizing’ Jesus in the room that evening, no mention of such or during the other visit with doubting Thomas and many others. It is also not a case of ‘clairvoyance’ in John’s believing, but is a simple case of DEDUCTION, Yannick…you know what deduction is right? You accuse me of looking thru the eyes of the modern faithful, I say you are completely wrong, as I have tried to put myself in the mind of the apostle John, one who had in most likelyhood witnessed Jesus death and burial and knew exactly how the tomb was left when it was sealed.","date":"January 3, 2013 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England"},{"author":"ron","post":"But Augustines’ interpretation is not!","date":"January 4, 2013 at 5:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/02/david-rolfe-some-hip-dude-in-england/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"David Rolfe, some hip dude in England"},{"author":"ron","post":"LOL, Your interpretation of what happened in the room is laughable.

Basically there were so many errors made back then during the testing, one being people took the results as concrete. In saying that, I feel, it was a shame the dating was accepted by the scientific community in particular, and should have been challenged immediately by them.

I will agree we ‘believers’ should all contemplate the ‘meaning’ of the Shroud. This I can say, I have done for many years. I’ve wondered why God would create this image in such a way that it’s true value would only be recognized in our modern era? and if so, what does that mean?

Q; Why must the image be complete anyways? We cannot presume to know what God would do or Not or how…so I think this attribute is irrelevant, except for our wanting to understand the image formation mechanism. Sure maybe our science of today is not advanced enough to understand the Shroud and many further tests are required, but I honestly believe even with complete direct access to the Shroud, the experts would still be at a loss to exlplain it, as one member of STURP stated “science cannot reproduce the resurrection in a lab” So maybe science will never solve the issue!.Which is my point. But ‘as it stands today’, science is baffled by this image, that alone speaks volumes. I agree with you that the blood is a big ‘clue’ to solving the mystery, but the image itself and it’s formation is the ‘Holy Grail’ here. The Jospine image is old news to me and from my readings on the subject it is fully undertstood that it does not carry some of the most intriguing attributes of the Shroud image. Mysterious yes, freak of nature, yes…but not in the same category as the Shroud image.So as it stands, also through my extensive readings over the past 2 decades and of my personal observations although limited, I truly believe the image is directly related, i.e; caused by the resurrection or a by-product of such…To me the onus is on science to disprove this and until they do, (and again I’ll state, I don’t believe they ever will) I will hold on to my ideas.Ron","date":"August 30, 2011 at 11:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/25/john-and-rebecca-jackson-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin-at-saint-james-the-just-parish-in-ogden-utah/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"John and Rebecca Jackson to Speak on the Shroud of Turin at Saint James the Just Parish in Ogden, Utah"},{"author":"ron","post":"Max Patrick Hamon :Sorry Steve to disagree with you , but the nose, eye, hair, beard and moustache images on the back and front side of the linen cloth are capillar not radiative images.

It has been on my mind for much time…First I must add that I can only make assertions here from what material we have available, so my observations are based on images available to me.I’ll attempt to address my assertions in point form to make it shorter and also make it easier to debate…From my observations;1. I notice a difference in “luminence” and ‘density’ between the posterior-markings (PMs) and ‘any’ burn markings. The PMs seem more reminiscent of some blood stains that seem to have ‘settled’ at the end of a blood stream.2. The PMs do not seem symetrical, not from a centered point of the Shroud itself or of the centering point of either the poker-hole burns or the larger burn markings. Also the angles are quite different! This leads me to believe these PMs are not related to either incident and are ‘independent’ of both.3. Observations from point 2 bring me too conclude the PSs were most likely not created whilst the Shroud was in a folded configuration…Due primarily to the angle of the formation….Note; I have seen any photos of what Max as suggested here.4. It seems improbable that the ‘liquid’ stains surrounding the PMs are a “dousing” as they are too exact. (Unless someone had a syringe style douser and centered it exactly to the stains)…This is especially evident from the top two stains (left & right). These are precise circular stains bearing from the center and also of a deeper colour then most all water stains.R","date":"January 30, 2012 at 11:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/29/quote-for-today-by-mario-latendresse/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for today by Mario Latendresse"},{"author":"ron","post":"Interesting!

I have curly hair by the way…Point being, with all the blood Jesus would have lost from the many head wounds, visibly present on the Shroud image, and also understanding that his head would be hanging forward, certainly once he passed, would explain quite easily the hair we see on the Shroud. I’ve always wondered actually why there isn’t much more blood in this area of the image.R.","date":"November 13, 2011 at 2:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"ron","post":"Alpha particles.R.","date":"November 13, 2011 at 12:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"ron","post":"Yannick, firstly, I was mearly anwsering your question and Alpha particles meet the criteria as they are known to only travel approx 4cm through air and will be halted by any solid surface with only minute penetration into material such as linen.Secondly, I think you should review some of your own writings/ thoughts.

I’ve made a long reflection about the blood and here’s my hypothesis about why there’s not more blood traces in the head and face region on the Shroud (while we know that any injury to the head region can easily cause an important bleeding – just like the description you did) :If we take notice of the study that was done about the Sudarium of Oviedo (http://www.shroud.com/heraseng.pdf), here’s the time estimation made by the authors (one of them was a pathologist by the way) : Jesus stayed about one hour on the cross after death. Then, he was dropped down from the cross and stayed on the ground another hour or so. Then, the body was moved to the tomb and this displacement took about 10 minutes. So, we have a total of about 2 hours and 10 minutes (maybe plus or minus 30 minutes) between the death of Jesus and the moment his body was laid in the Shroud. It’s well enough time for many of the blood clots that were still humid at the moment of his death to dried out completely and, because of that, those dried blood clot were not able to leave any imprint on the cloth. Only a small portion of the blood was able to stay enough humid during all this time to stained the cloth by the process called “decals of humid blood clots”. And for the face, notice how few blood stains are present there. I think there’s a good probability that the face was rapidly clean-up with another cloth (by respect for the dead). If a rapid clean-up of the face was really done, then I have to think the hypothesis of Lavoie who pretend the blood that we see in the hair region on both sides of the face was originaly directly on the face… But if the clean-up was done just to remove the blood and fluid that was mainly present in the beard and mustache (and was not done on the cheeks), then, maybe Lavoie hypothesis is correct after all. This hypothesis of Lavoie is not easy to analyzed… What do you think of this hypothesis Ron ?But, for the blood present in the face and head region, if there’s not more decals present, I really think it is mainly due to the fact that the body was put in the Shroud only a long time after death, so that many blood clots that were humid at the time of death were not able to stay humid all this time and dried out completely. Only a small portion was able to stay humid enough to stain the cloth.This hypothesis is in total agreement with both the study done on the Sudarium of Oviedo and the gospel accounts for a burial that wasn’t prepared at all and wasn’t even expected.Well I have contemplated alot of these things myself. I have read much on the Sudarium and I believe they concluded the sudarium was placed over the head/face of Christ after death, while still on the cross and approx an hour later he was removed. Seeing as scriptures mention a storm brewed up (and picturing high winds) I see no reason to refute that most all blood, sweat or any body fluids would have been almost completely dry by the time they even took him down from the cross! Let alone another hour passing before he is even placed in the Shroud. But then there is the question of dirt being blown around and covering the body, as it was still damp. Plus if we acept the times concluded with the sudarium, he was then laying in front of the cross (face down apparently) for another hour…So what happened to all the dirt??? This is one of the reasons I tend to appreciate Zugibe’s hypothesis that the body was ‘partially’ washed during the burial….it would explain alot, but raises questions of it’s own. Lavoie’s hypothesis makes sense if you accept the concept that the Shroud fell thru the body. As there would be no other explanation for the blood decals to have shifted.Ron.","date":"November 14, 2011 at 1:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"ron","post":"Thanks. But I’m not saying I found the answer to the Shroud image, just to your question; “What kind of energy could loose 80% of it’s capacity to colour a cloth within a short distance like that?” Alpha particles like I said will not penetrate all solids but, they will penetrate some solids with the density of say linen or cloth, and only penetrate these materials very minutely; meaning only the top fibrels possibly. It then would not matter if the cloth, sheet or Shroud were actually a millimeter or 4cm away from the source, the penetration would be relatively the same and as Alpha waves will not travel much further then approx 4cm through air, it would not penetrate anything placed further…hense the drop-off in the image.This my friend is scientific facts about alpha particles and their properties!…Whether they are involved in the Shroud image formation?

I think you’re wrong about that. As I recall, the Centro’s conclusion indicates that it was placed very shortly after death occured and it stayed in contact with the head for 2 hours (not 2.5 hours). I just wanted to set the record straight about that.” -Try reading a little closer in the future….Bennett pg74, pt6; “On the lower part of the left edge of the cloth are a series of stains which correspond to puncture wounds, produced while the man was still alive and [which shed blood approximately one hour before the linen was placed on them].” …para mine.From the paper; Comparative Study of the SoO and the SHroud of Turin, III International Congress, June 1998; Mareno, Villilian.Pt7; “At the bottom of the back of the head, there is a series of wounds produced in life by some sharp objects. These wounds HAD BLED an HOUR before the cloth was placed on top of them.”This clearly means liveblood stopped flowing approximately one hour before the Sudarium was placed on the head…As any blood flow would stop flowing with the advent of death and the heart pumping…simple deduction and reasoning. Again it seems, you Yannick, read or obsorb only what you want to.As to your statements on the C14 and Jull’s comments; Lets please try reading that section again and try being a little more HONEST about the context of the comments and the actual serious lack of protocols, and the true nature of the samples being as they were in a gaseous state in viles, which the lab themselfs claimed were “leaking air”.

Then from the frontal stains again, but these ones flowing up the nose to the forehead, it was deduced that the body lay partially face down with the head resting against a solid object for approx another 45 minutes to an hour… The Sudarium was then rewrapped fully around the head and the body was moved, where finally five to ten minutes later the Sudarium was completely removed from the body…I don’t see how that can be so difficult to comprehend.

I haven’t read Guscin’s book myself, so I cannot make any comments to it…As for the C14 tests you mention, none of these were reliable! Mario Maroni had sent two labs (Tuscon, Toronto) samples he acquirred, which Max Frei had taken, in 1979. These tests were performed in 1994, …thats 15 years later! The condtions in which the samples were stored was not known, the tests were done without authorization or tracking. Plus there was a myriad of issues pertaining to ALL the C14 tests done, too long to list here…It is pretty clear none of the C14 tests done are of any ‘serious scientific value’…Incidently, Dr. Jull, when questioned by Guscin pertaining to the testing, made a very enticing statement; “in order to produce a radiocarbon date on any paticular material, it is important that the origin of the samples be known and clearly stated to the laboratory.” ….Origin?, …provenance…Ring a BELL? The C14 tests done on the Sudarium are completely irrelevant, period.Moving along to your question on Bilirubin, Mr Jones can only repeat what he would read from Guscin’s or Bennett’s writings, because as far as I know he has no access to the EDICES papers and cannot read Spanish, so don’t expect any new announcements. ;-)  Miss Bennett on the other hand can translate Spanish quite well, but did state in her book that much of the EDICES reports were of a very ‘technical’ nature and she would keep her writings to a more understandable level for her readers.I have a question for you on the whole Bilirubin thingy; Are you a medical expert? It would seem to me that you are assuming the postmordem 1part blood, 6 parts serum liquid found on the cloth would contain bilirubin? Would it?…We need an expert here to answer that question as I am no expert and definately am not so sure about it. We also cannot know whether bilirubin is mentioned or not in the EDICES studies, or if they had studied all blood samples found on the Sudarium.

Wilson has covered the reasoning for this in his books quite well and is easily understandable. If one understands when these Mandylion paintings were created, the artists did not have the pleasure of seeing the Shroud image in the ‘positive’ as we do today. They did not in most probability get to see the Shroud image face in bright light or natural sunlight. It is more likely they were viewing the Shroud in the semi-darkness of a candle lit cathedral. When the Shroud face is viewed without any aids it is quite reasonable to mistake the eyes as being opened>IF one can forget the negative we are accustomed too and realize the actual ‘faintness’ of the Shroud when viewed in real life. So Wilson’s assumption is quite reasonable and most likely the truth of the matter. Furthermore some here must also realize the blood, if viewed in ‘real life viewing’ is basically indistinguishable from the body image. One must also accept if the Shroud was folded in eight and partially covered, these artists would have no conception of it being a burial cloth. All these points very reasonably explain the ‘open to closed eye’ interpretations found in artistic renditions.As for the C14 fiasco, it was a nooby mistake by de Wesselow to not back his statements with links to evidencial documents but maybe he expects the reader will reasearch on thier own! If one does research the c14 fiasco and there are many many papers to study. One would question much about the whole process which occurred and one of these processes was the ‘breaking of evidence’ when the Shroud sample cut from the Shroud was taken to a different room (out of site from the camera) and anyone else.

I see their findings has possible ‘clues’ to the authenticity of the Shroud, nothing more, and I believe that is their stand.Although Barrie is right in that we must be prudent in such findings, it would not be very logical to dispell them too quickly either.We’ve agreed several times that further studies are required, much more, also chemical analysis ‘may’ render some interesting findings if areas where flowers, plants have been seen are tested.Pollen evidence can be very telling and relatively precise. But chemical studies will never prove or disprove the apparent coin images.I don’t see these potential images has being any different from all other characteristics of the Shroud as they can be very telling if found to be real, especially the coins.There has been much said about the coins, dozens of articles and papers, yet you cannot refute certain things, ‘definite roundel protrusions over the eyes’ seen especially clear in VP-8 images…background noise?, maybe, but that is just an assumption.My mind is still open to any conclusions on this subject and just find all the research fascinating.Ron","date":"July 27, 2011 at 10:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/06/13/david-rolfe-interview-with-avinoam-danin-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"David Rolfe Interview with Avinoam Danin on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"ron","post":"I was just making the point that a 3d image of a flower IS visible and not an imaginary thing.Many people refuse to believe flower images exist AT ALL on the Shroud and although I have found it hard to see any of them from normal pictures of the actual Shroud, I have seen it clearly on a VP-8 3D rendering….I agree this 3d flower image could have occured at any time, but it is there nonetheless!…This also must allow us not to refute too quickly other things said to be found on the Shroud; coins over the eyes for example, which by the way most VP-8 renderings of the face do show some kind of objects or protrusions over the eyes.Chemical analysis, yes I agree needs to be continued on a large scale but this is up to the Church.Mind you they have found pollens of many plants on the Shroud, but that is another blog.","date":"July 11, 2011 at 12:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/06/13/david-rolfe-interview-with-avinoam-danin-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"books","title":"David Rolfe Interview with Avinoam Danin on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"ron","post":"I think, if I could post that vp-8 image here, there would be no doubt you’d see a figure of a flower, you or anyone else.

Such as Why? Why would anyone have an ossuary created for one whom they believed had risen and were also preaching he had risen? Wouldn’t that be a little strange or counter to one’s ideals?  Where did the carpel bone come from? as everything pertaining to the body including any blood which could be captured, would have been buried within the Shroud as required by Jewish law. Remember nothing was mentioned found in the tomb but a few cloths. So in this story, basically one is to believe someone found a carpel bone in the tomb (even though christ’s body had been raised in entirety), held onto it for a year then placed it in another tomb? Also although none of these members of the family were from Jerusalem, none of the ossuaries state those buried were from another location, which was customary to do so. The Mariamne ossuary (very dubiously depicted as that of Mary Magdelene) can basically be eliminated from any statistical calculation, which was my point. Just because a Jesus family tomb has yet to be found anywhere else doesn’t give any more credence to the Talpiot tomb and in fact there is no proof that anyone of Jesus’s family stayed in Jerusalem whatsoever, (that I am aware of) except James who was (apparently) stoned in Jerusalem.

So, it’s not the Shroud and his image formation mechanism (whatever it can be) that is important, it is the person depicted on the Shroud and the message he bring to all mankind. That’s what is important. If the Shroud would disappeared or been destroyed, that wouldn’t be a disaster because we know it was there and real. We know it was a SIGN that point into one direction : Jesus-Christ and his message of Love. That’s what really matter to me. The Shroud is a material object, like the empty tomb was. It’s not important in itself. What matters is the man and the message he point to. And I would also say this : genuine or not, it’s not even so important because I’m sure that the Holy Spirit use this cloth for a good purpose which is this : bring many people closer to the real God reveal by Jesus-Christ and especially by his death on the cross.

What is idolatry in your mind ? Here’s my own definition : Idolatry is when you focus far more your attention on the physical sign than on the person this sign point to (Jesus-Christ). You don’t see a risk of this with the Shroud ? I see it everyday here on this blog !!! That’s why the Church to “use” the Shroud to convert people or to promote his teaching… And it’s a VERY good thing that the Church act like that. The Shroud is nothing important. Jesus-Christ is the center of our belief. Nobody should need the Shroud to believe in Jesus.Geez sometimes Yannick you can be pretty daft, sorry but it’s true. Not once did I say one must idolize the Shroud. But the Shroud is here and if you believe it is here because God created it, and wanted us to see it, then how can it be idolatry to accept it’s message, it’s ‘sign’. Not placing it ahead of God but seeing it as a sign of what he did for us and a proof of his love for us….Is that clear enough? If by the wonderment of this Shroud, meaning, it’s inability to be understood ‘scientifically’, it brings some to question thier worldviews and thus to try to find God, what possibly can be wrong with that?

But in this study it was excluded that a coin could, if placed over the eye socket, find it’s way out of the skull cavity unless the skull ended up in the upright position. So it was concluded the coin was placed over the eyes during burial. Also, I could find no issue in all my readings of ancient Jewish culture, in placing coins over the eyes. So my point is that it is not controversial that coins may have been used in a first century Jewish burial, and/or to possibly keep the eyes closed(?).

Like I said, I don’t understand completely what they were trying to say, and how it can relate to the Shroud. Otherwise it is a fine documentary. I just wonder who wrote the script?, if you pay attention they use the word ‘actually’ about twenty times in the first 10 minutes or so. Also some of the details where flawed or not explained properly which could lead to ‘misconception’ by the layperson of the Shroud, pertaining to it’s history and details. But, also like as I’ve said it was a good doc, probably one of the best out there so far. The History channel should air it more often, that is one of my beefs.

As he does not understand the simple fact that not only from scripture (John 20:7), but from details observed from the study of the Sudarium and also evidenced on the Shroud, that the Sudarium and the Shroud did not compete for image quality. As the Sudarium was removed before the the Shroud wrapped the body and before the image mechanism occurred. This point was made by Stephen Jones on his blog, I just thought it needed mentioning here.As for his statement that there is “no correspondence whatsoever”, I think colin should atleast read one book on the subject of the Sudarium before making such rediculous comments. There is not just a simple “correspondence” of blood image shapes;( 70 points of congruence front and back to be exact), but also the stains are of very close dimensions, slightly larger stains are found on the Sudarium, as would be expected. The stains show the nose length being identical, as well as the beard stain on the Sudarium when compared to the Shroud.
