Given the forensic evidence that would seem to indicate this cloth is Jesus it is a stunning coincidence that the burial cloth of that man who has rumored to have been Resurrected also has an image that despite the best efforts of well, everyone, cannot be explained naturally. Its just a feeling I have that this is not a coincidence. Add to this the negative image, 3 D data, X ray like quality etc. And I do think a supernatural explanation is plausible though we should keep searching for a natural hypothesis. The teeth in the image behind closed lips is an example of the X ray like quality the image has. I really do think in this particular image the row of teeth are clear as day http://blog.world mysteries.com/wp content/uploads/2012/07/shroud sml1.jpg Also, why in 2015 are there still people who do not believe the Shroud held a real human body that leaked blood on the Shroud? As far as I can tell such people are not helping Shroud research one bit denying some of the most basic well established details about the Shroud. The blood is to red? There are a number of explanations, and just because there is one detail about the blood that we don’t understand completely doesn’t mean therefore blood isn’t on the Shroud, but its better and convenient for certain hypothesis to ignore all the other evidence for real blood I guess..","date":"2015-10-31","mins":"3:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/30/bob-rucker-a-burst-of-radiation-did-three-things/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Bob Rucker:  A Burst of Radiation Did Three Things"},{"id":"comment-213945","author":"matthew_l","post":"I think it would be something that happened during the Resurrection process not by Jesus, but by God the Father.

Independently confirmed by Dr. Baima Bollone, and its only the opinion of the STRP team and nearly every medical expert, pathologist, immunologist etc. I’m fine with saying it is not 100% proven, but it is pretty well established. Your assertion that forensic experts have not seen blood this red is unjustified. If I remember correctly jbejon who I believe said he was medical experience (might have spelled his name wrong) said on here that it is not abnormal at all. When all the tests done indicate that it is real blood with serum stains included then the fact that the blood is red is just something that needs to be worked out, and there are multiple explanations on the table that are credible. You don’t jump to conclusions and say it proves the blood is not real blood, that is absurd. Well, it happens a lot Charles I see it all the time. Deny Jesus burial despite it being well established and you have a weaker Resurrection argument that you can refute easier. Deny the blood despite it being well established and its a lot easier to deny the authenticity of the Shroud. With all due respect, you know nothing about blood stains, neither do I. However, when multiple independent peer reviewed test by blood chemist/medical experts come to the conclusion that there is real blood I would think you ought to respect that conclusion. When the vast majority of those with medical experience who have see the Shroud in person or in lifesize pictures (Barbet, Zugibe, Bucklin the list goes on and on) agree it is real blood you ought to respect their expert opinion as well. And I don’t want to hear about anonymous forensic experts you have allegedly consulted with. Lastly, it is not easy to just say “well someone just tossed some medieval blood on there” its not that simple, and i’m sure this has been explained to you many times before. I have to be honest Charles i’m not sure another series of test would do anything to sway your opinion. Why do we even need a handful more of experts to tell us what all the other experts have been saying all along?.","date":"2015-10-31","mins":"7:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/30/bob-rucker-a-burst-of-radiation-did-three-things/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Bob Rucker:  A Burst of Radiation Did Three Things"},{"id":"comment-213963","author":"matthew_l","post":"We have to get rid of the concept of bodily Resurrection?

The skeptics tend to love linking the article you mention. However, I am fully convinced partly because of Thomas de Wesselow that the shroud is absolutely not any type of painting, but the real burial cloth of someone. There is real blood on the shroud which is completely confirmed by dozens of pathologist/blood chemist, and there is no brush marks whatsoever. Everything like the naked corpse, wound marks on wrists, single nail through feet, whip marks, crown of thorns etc. Looks authentic. For example, medieval, and christian art shows at least a loin cloth on Jesus, and sometimes much more clothing, wound marks in the palms, a crown of thorns that is almost like a sweatband. Also how would a forger know what a roman flagella wound looked like? Yehohanan the crucified man from the 1st century had a single nail through his feet like the man on the Shroud appears to have been nailed through the feet. Moreover, the feet on the shroud are not even visible, and why would an artist make an incomplete “painting”, and why would he go to such extreme measures to make a forgery? An obvious artwork was revered as the burial cloth of Christ centuries ago it isn’t very hard to convince people, and you didn’t have to go to such extreme measures that would be necessary to create the shroud. Medieval paintings differ in style, and don’t match the rugged look of the man on the shroud that is medically accurate etc. I do agree there is not absolute conclusive evidence that traces the Shroud back to the 1st century, but I don’t think that is required. It is either Jesus or a forgery, and if it is Jesus it comes from the 1st century. There is however clues that it was in existence early on like coins, christ pantocrators, pray manuscript, sudarium of oviedo, and perhaps Jerusalem dirt/limestone, and perhaps what i’m not sure of pollen..","date":"2015-09-10","mins":"2:15 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/08/new-youtuibe-presentation-is-the-shroud-of-medieval-forgery/","cat":"presentation","title":"New YouTube Presentation:  Is the Shroud a Medieval Forgery?"},{"id":"comment-210008","author":"matthew_l","post":"I think De Wesselow dealt with Nickells silly rubbing technique as well as the blood being “painted on”…That is just mind boggling wrong.

Jesus had a pretty unique death so its not all that hard to tell it is in fact Jesus, and not some anonymous crucifixion victim, and of course by tradition the cloth has been connected to Jesus which is worth noting, and i’m not sure why a burial cloth would even be taken out a tomb unless it was significant. I believe the forensic evidence is more than enough to establish the authenticity of the Shroud, but its always nice to have additional evidence like #7 where there is Jerusalem limestone. Its significant to me that it is largely concentrated near the feet which again just shows this is an authentic burial cloth of someone who walked around probably barefoot before being killed. Until we get further testing on the aragonite which i’m dying to see it will remain not quite excellent evidence, but still decent further evidence in part of a cumulative case for authenticity. #2, and #3 are very significant for the Carbon Dating question, and along w/ other pieces of evidence I think shows the results are probably in error without even getting into the scientific evidence. #6 Is interesting, but I don’t find it evidence for authenticity really, but more like possible evidence for the Resurrection. The body in the Shroud left within a couple days like Jesus in the Gospels left his empty tomb. Why did the body leave? Was it manual extraction or did Jesus just “disappear”? I think the evidence and what we see on the Shroud points to the latter more so than the former.

This was a helpful post. I had the impression that the Christ Pantocrators and coins etc. And their connection to the Shroud depended on the Image of Edessa, but your post seems to be saying there could have been a completely different cloth that is responsible for the Pantocrators, and coins. For the Mandylion and it just being a face isn’t there an explanation for that? Wasn’t the Turin Shroud folded so just the face was visible? There does seem to be obvious folds on the turin shroud, and it can be folded in such a way to look like the Mandylion..","date":"2015-09-30","mins":"4:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/22/recent-interview-with-russ-breault/","cat":"video","title":"Recent Interview with Russ Breault"}],"textile":[{"id":"comment-213787","author":"matthew_l","post":"Hugh it seems to me like relying on the C 14 dating to show the Shroud is medieval is a house built on cards much like Richard Carrier’s hypothesis that Jesus didn’t exist is built on a house of cards…For example.. 1.) You need the pray codex to not be connected to the Shroud despite decent evidence (modestly) that it is… 2.) You need the Sudarium of Oviedo to not be authentic when there are studies/observations that would indicate that is connected to the Shroud… 3.) You need the repair hypothesis that has been put forward and defended in multiple peer reviewed papers and has been put forward and defended by textile experts, chemist, other scientist etc. To be dead wrong with no basis in truth 4.) You need all the Coins that appear to be connected or based on the Shroud before the dating range to be mere coincidence 5.) You need the Christ Pantocrators to not be based on the Shroud despite a clear congruence between them, and the Shroud. Etc. Etc. Etc. It seems to me like the dating of the Shroud should be an open question. There is evidence that the dating is wrong, and certain details or evidences that point earlier..The dating should be considered, but not much more then that. It is not proof or hard evidence for anything. If skeptics on here, and elsewhere always need additional independent test on topics like Aragonite, Shroud blood type, and the like I would think to be fair skeptics on here should demand additional independent tests on a carbon dating this is very controversial and indeed questionable before making claims that it shows the Shroud is medieval..","date":"2015-10-28","mins":"9:43 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/28/banding-proves-cloth-was-not-repaired/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Banding Proves Cloth Was Not Repaired?"},{"id":"comment-213845","author":"matthew_l","post":"“None of this will seem relevant to this site as no one accepts that the Shroud was once a painted linen.
