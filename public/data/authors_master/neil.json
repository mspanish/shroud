{"opinion":[{"author":"neil","post":"How is it possible to like someone who believes that what you believe in is just magic dust and fairy tales, right?  Well in a certain sense it works both ways, doesn’t it?  Can a christian really claim that they don’t apply the same discrimination towards athiests?  Historically, there’s a incredibly wide and varied selection of incidents I could choose from.. inquisition, Salem witchhunt, crusades.  Any freethinker with enough intelligence to become athiest during such dark eras and have the courage to admit it were either burned as witches or thrown into the river with weights on their feet with the idea that witches would float.\nOf course I’m generalizing here.  Most christians aren’t like that nor would they dare try to argue with an athiest, much less try to hurt one.  However most athiests too are this way, aside from certain exceptions like the ones above with a personal vendetta and perhaps even something to sell you.\n\n","date":"May 16, 2011 at 3:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/05/06/whodathunk-why-do-americans-still-dislike-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Whodathunk: Why do Americans Still Dislike Atheists?"}]}
