Perhaps, someone has already done it, ruled it out, and it is simply that I am not fully aware of all the scientific literature about the Shroud. However, using high resolution images, pixel values can feed rather simple mathematical tests of randomness and using Montecarlo/bootstrap techniques, 95% confidence levels decision intervals could be quite easily assessed. 95% confidence levels are widely accepted in scientific literature as enough to reach conclusions and could help in determining if what some claim they see is just noise or there really exists a discernible pattern.\n\n","date":"February 2, 2012 at 7:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/02/luciano-buso-whats-the-point-of-denying-my-theory/","cat":"art","title":"Luciano Buso: What’s the point of denying my theory"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Maria, just to make clear my point, when I say that “we are far from having scientific evidences”, I refer exclusively to the coins/flowers/writings issue and not the Shroud itself.

In this video of the Malaga exhibition, it can be seen from minute 4:30 onwards.

Unfortunately, that database does not exist and so far, we only have a few unconnected studies here and there corresponding to different moments of history.\nIn the absence of such an extensive database, the most important difficulty about AB being old is that until now, the oldest evidences of mixtures between European and Asian population dated back to 9th-10th century in Hungary.\nThe relevance of this paper is that this indirect argument and -the most important difficulty I have come through so far- can now be ruled out and at least, we have here an important example dating back to the Iron Age.\nSo now, we cannot say how old is the AB blood group, but certainly other arguments -not put forward so far- should be used  because, certainly there were mixtures of lineages before 900 AD in Hungary and after this paper, nothing is against dating back AB blood type (or any group like O)  to at least 1st century or before.\n\n","date":"November 14, 2012 at 1:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/11/14/early-evidence-of-ab-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Early Evidence of AB Blood"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Which are the foundations for this presumption?

A simple glance at the figures clearly indicates that it is there.\nThe author provides the figures obtained with the scores corresponding to the first PC.  However in my view, a PC analysis to be really meaningful should be carried out with the whole Shroud, just like Marion did in his JCR paper. One of the purposes of PC analysis is to identify underlying effects and such a general approach could allow identification of what each PC represents. Perhaps, in this work using only a small area this is not possible.\nFinally, instead of using K-means I would recommend the author to confirm his clustering with a more reliable technique like Partition Around Medoids. The value of the silohuette could help identify how many clusters should be used and again, results could be more meaningful.

Dawkins mentions the fire of 1532 as a possible explanation but who knows?…..The true point is that we only have a few vague ideas on how a C14 test will work with ancient linens, touched by millions of persons throughout history, kept in varying conditions of humidity and temperature for centuries and partially burnt 480 years ago. The point is that the Shroud -whatever it is- is a unique piece of linen and using off-the-shelf tests like C14 when we don`t have a background knowledge of what we can expect or how interpretate results, may be highly misleading.\nOne of the areas on the Shroud about which research has progressed most and currently, we have a more solid and conclusive knowledge, is all the forensic/blood aspects. In my opinion, on the contrary of C14 tests on ancient linens, in general, we know virtually everything about dead human corpses and human blood behaviour. Since the researchers had this previous knowledge, the specific tests carried out on the Shroud on these areas, could easily be put into context, correctly understood and represent eda major step forward\nin research. This previous and commonly accepted knowledge is the main difference with the C14 test and allowed much more easily than in other areas of research, an almost general consensus on the forensic aspects of the Shroud.\nFor  this reason, regardless the fact that most probably the test was carried out on a non-representative sample, a new C14 test might not help at all because we don`t know enough on how to put new results in the context on an ancient linen which has gone through such a very particular chain of events. Perhaps, if enough had been known, even the C14 would have been ruled out from the beginning.\nThe same risk may happen if readily available, breaking-edge technologies are blindly applied in the frame of a new set of tests. Again, without a contextual knowledge of these tests when applied to similar cloths, new dissapointing figures may emerge from a computer while a new cycle of discussions starts again for the next years.\n\n","date":"January 21, 2012 at 8:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/21/dissent-of-the-day-with-a-bit-of-a-response/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Dissent of the day with a bit of a response"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"The point of datation and C14 is something that from time to time comes up in this blog.\nIt is really important because finding an accurate alternative to the c14 test would mean\nan important step forward.\nIn this line, I have recently come across a peer-reviewed paper (1) by one of the STURP members which to my surprise, has been widely ignored and even in shroud.com is only tangentially commented.\nIt mentions that the ratios of deuterium/hidrogen and two isotopes of of oxigen can contribute to determine the geographical origin of any linen.

But not because we detect a trend. My point is that this trend could be present in both cases (reweaving and original cloth) and would not contribute the least to distinguish between them.\nJos, I think that there is -please read again my previous comment- a significative difference between having a trend and not having anything but a chaotic distribution. But I agree with you when you say that the conclusion is that the 1988 C14 test was measuring two combined effects:age and something else.\nI tend to think that this x factor could be explained by a higher contamination of samples in peripherical areas, but it could be any other.\nAnd we come to my point why C14 test is not appliable here. In 1988 it was not known, but now we know that in cases like the Shroud there is always a x factor interfering datation!\nIt is precisely the presence of a trend that indicates that there is a discernible x effect! This x factor or any others are also likely to appear if new C14 tests are carried out. The C14 is a technique of the 80’s and cannot overcome this limitation, regardless fully representative samples are taken.\nTo be honest, I would like to stress the idea that another implication of the presence of a trend obtained from a combination of results independently obtained at different laboratories is that these labs did a good job. Otherwise a random combination of poorly analyzed samples would have never given the result of a trend 24 years later and most probably detect the existance of a x factor. I know a lot of people will disagree with me but I think in the light of this paper there are grounds to support my previous statement. It is also fair to recognize it after so much criticism.\nIn my opinion, these are the major reasons why the Church-which always gets very qualified scientific advice- will never carry out new C14 tests (not conspiration theories).

However, the maximum and minimum C14 counts across the 12 subsamples still support the idea of  a medieval artifact. The lack of homegeneity in the samples moves between C14 counts associated to medieval datation boundaries. \nIf there is a trend, it only indicates a different behaviour in different areas, which may well be associated to a more intensive handling and thus contamination in peripheric areas of the linen. Or perhaps to any other effect but please note, that if the sample belonged to a medieval reweaving, as so often has been stated, the trend still seems to be there. For this reason, I think that the detection of a trend does not invalidate anything: it could be explained in the case of being a sample belonging to the original linen and also in the case of a medieval reweaving.\nThe kind of lack of homogeneity that the presence of a trend indicates is not a chaotic one. It represents a smooth and ordered change in C14 counts with distance thus indicating that most probably a physical effect (I pointed out one but it can be any other) is behind this trend. We cannot forget that the boundaries still are associated to a medieval datation.\nIf the lack of homegeneity among the 12 subsamples were really chaotic with datations moving let’s say between 3000BC and 1600 CE and randomly distributed among the subsamples, this would represent a solid argument against coming with an average datation (medieval or not).\nAs a conclusion, in my opinion, the results presented in this paper do not contribute the  least to invalidate the 1988 carbon dating. Furthermore, a trend and not a chaotic distribution  sort of indicate a rigourous and systematic methodology applied by the different laboratories whose results when combined, are solid enough as to conform a discernible trend. Please, remember that this statement also applies if a medieval reweaving (a very reasonable option in the light of widely published results) had been tested.\nI don`t agree either with Charles Freeman and Daveb when they sort of say that a new C14 test is needed. This is also a common place in many comments here. I have in many occasions written comments about this issue ,so I will summarize my point by saying that in 1988 it was thought that the C14 test was appliable to virtually everything. Now there is more than enough evidence to state that this test cannot be used with the Shoud and new datation strategies should move towards other techniques.\n\n","date":"April 28, 2012 at 7:00 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/28/new-peer-reviewed-paper-on-the-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"New Peer Reviewed Paper on the Carbon Dating of the Shroud of Turin."},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Dan, I agree with you only partially.

The authors have achieved to distinguish linens from Poland, Italy and Japan using those 11 trace elements.\nI think it would really be helpful to carry out the same analysis on the Shroud and clearly establish whether its linen comes from the Middle East (one point for authenticity) or from let’s say France.\nA second recent paper (in this case with cotton(2)) shows that particular combinations of trace elements can allow a correct identification of the state (in USA) the cotton comes from in 81% of the cases. In this case, the authors obtain “results of very clear and distinct clusters with no overlap”. I think that this sounds promising.\nFinally, there is a third paper written in 1988 (3) .

In other cases, they are openly accused of conscient manipulation and falsification of the whole process.\nI certainly do not share this view and most particularly since last year when two independent research works(1) and (2) have identified (or better said confirmed previous guesses) through different and independent ways the presence of a slope in the sample.\nIf in an UV-F photograph, which was taken by Vernon D. Miller of the Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Clara, California in 1978, a trend can be detected and then, 34 years later combining data provided by the labs a similar trend is also detected, for me it is quite clear that the labs -beyond perhaps some minor mistakes- did a good job. \nI would love to hear an alternative explanation of how can it be explained that two different techniques (PCA+statistical techniques, C14 counting) applied to two different research items (image , cloth sample) with a lapse of 34 years, detect the same (a trend). \nThe conclusion is that whatever the driving mechanism behind the slope is ( I would say it is simply different degrees of organic contamination due to different intensity of manipulation along the centuries), the point is that the sample cleaning and preparation process was not effective and in spite of it, the trend was still there when the labs started to count C14 atoms\nIt is exactly the same type of objections against C14 test that the scientific literature along these years has been showing: the process of sample cleaning and organic contamination removal is virtually impossible with some objects (like the Shroud). Even more in 1988.\nThe few comments I have read on the trend, tend to interpretate it as an additional argument against the professionality of the laboratories and as another sign of the big mess the whole radiocarbon test was.\nDan asks: Will we ever know what really happened?. Let’s start by analyzing all the facts available. That includes the trend. However, in my view, this issue has been largely ignored so far. A plausible explanation is needed on the presence of this trend. I have given mine but I am open to further discussion, different perspectives and even accepting more solid explanations on this subject.  Closing our eyes to the fact will not help the least if we want to understand:\ni) the role that the C14 test played in 1988\nii) its appropiateness for future dating of the Shroud.\n(1)Digital image processing techniques demonstrating the\nanomalous nature of the radiocarbon dating sample\narea of the Shroud of Turin.

This post and also the post of Jan 1 by Russ Breault are good examples. The underlying idea is that if a new C14 test is carried out on the original linen, the results would confirm that it is authentic. \nHowever, I see a big paradox here, since the validity of the C14 method itself when applied to ancient cloths, has been scientifically challenged –not only but yes to a great extent- by the Shroud researchers community since 1988. And I think they have succeded in that. Therefore, in 2012 it can be stated that the method is not reliable for ancient linens, regardless the sample is correctly chosen or not and also regardless the statistical technique used. It is due to these intrinsic shortcomes and limitations of the C14 method –mainly the fact that the effect from a bioplastic organic coating cannot be removed from cloths(1)- that new methodologies have to be explored. \nIt may well happen (and I personally would bet yes!!) that in a new C14 test -this time with the correct sample- the results indicate something similar to the tests of for example, the Sudarium of Oviedo (7th century) and the results would not be conclusive once again. Radiocarbon dating belongs to the 80’s and currently very powerful techniques are available which could help. \nWhy not leave behind once and for all the C14 method and concentrate on what state-of –the-art technologies can offer in 2012 and forthcoming years?\nIn this sense, I would like to mention the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). With this almost non-destructive technique applied to cloths it is possible to identify the trace elements present (2) on cotton or linen that can make it possible to scientifically connect the cloth with a certain area (3) of the world (for example Palestine). It would also make it possible to build a definitive connection (or completely rule it out) between the Shroud and the Sudarium of Oviedo.\nThe best of all, it needs such a small sample that it is considered as nearly non-destructive and the material captured in the sticky tapes would be enough.\n(1) H.E.

With all we know now C14 would be the least relevant of all candidate tests.\nBut for the Catholic church, her most important error in 1988 was that she lost control of the tests and the way they were made public. Now they have the chance of conducting tests without the pressure of public opinion and release little by little all the information, at their own rythm and for their own religious purposes (not for example to promote C14 labs). The design of the (unexpected) 2010 exhibition in Turin and the current exhibition in Malaga are clearly pro-authenticity and use this not as a stand-alone scientific fact, but in the frame of the Church’s evangelization purposes.

Their results were truly promising and a simple analysis of threads could have determined the geographical origin of the Shroud.\nI cannot stop thinking how different research on the Shroud could have been along these years, if the first isotopic approach and subsequent methodological developments had focused on oxygen and hydrogen instead of or simultaneously with carbone. This first decision in favour of C14 test put the focus on a methodology that now we know is not appropiate and has determined the evolution of the research not only for the Shroud, but also for example, the Oviedo sudarium. It also meant ruling out further research and tests on geographical origin and oxygen and hydrogen.\nIf all we know now on the C14 were also available for what authors propose, I am pretty sure that in 2012,  we would be in a completely different situation regarding the research on the Shroud.\nDeNiro-M.J., Sternberg, L., Marino, B and_Drusik-J.

To my surprise, the widely extended idea that there is a correlation between cloth-body distance and image intensity is based on a very reduced sample: 13 measurement points only! The authors recognize this and state that 1700 points should be needed to clearly establish a mathematical model describing the exact nature of the relationship between distance and intensity of the image. While the fact that the image shows 3D properties clearly indicates that some kind of relationship exists and intensity attenuation of the image takes place (no doubt at this point), the exact nature of this relationship may represent an important step forward because some mechanisms (energetic fields, radiation, diffusion, laminar flow) and their change with distance, exhibit very particular mathematical profiles.

Although at first sightbno significant difference can be detected, if there is a linear relationship between intensity and distance, this would be completely different from having either a quadratic or exponential relationship. However, due to the small distances, below 4 cm, all the 3d encoding patterns would yield similar images and significant correlation coefficients.  Most 3d images are based on a linear relationship between intensity and distance.  If the relationship in the Shroud were different, lets say exponential,  this would very clearly indicate the nature of the mechanism involved.The exponential relationship between distance and intensity is only possible with one type of formation mechanism\n\n","date":"October 2, 2015 at 5:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Ok, I just wanted to highlight the idea that if it can be properly and undoubtedly determined the nature of that relationship, the type of mechanism that originated the image can be clearly established.\n\n","date":"October 2, 2015 at 3:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/02/the-definitive-word-on-3d-from-ok/","cat":"3d","title":"The Definitive Word on 3D from OK?"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Well, Daveb, you have touched a crucial question.

Additionally, I have carefully read the full post “An Excellent Analysis of the Coins-on-the-Eyes Issue” by Jos Verhulst from Antwerp.\nIn my opinion, there are two major difficulties regarding the coin issue that I guess at this stage, are nearly impossible to overcome or revert.\n1.All the photographies used were taken in the analogic era. In the case of father Filas they are second generation photos. The image analyzing techniques used at that time cannot be compared with current ones and determining the degree of validity corresponding to those techniques….is just impossible. In some cases, some of these photos have jumped into the digital era after being scanned. But how? For example, most scanners provide JPG images which though not visible at first sight, originate a compression of pixel values. Only TIFF images should be used. This is only an example. How much information –if any- is lost in the way? I miss a thorough research on this aspects.\n2.All the claims –as mentioned by Murra and DiLazzaro-are based on a subjectivity approach of the images. It is someone who sees something that the rest sometimes can see or not. However, the existance or not of hidden images is something that can be defined in an objective way. Current machine learning algorithms like Self-Organizing Maps or Random Forests combined with MonteCarlo/bootstrapping techniques could provide a mathematical approach and determine if a discernible pattern exists or we are talking about noise.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2011 at 6:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"The last days, I have tried to find the existing literature about coins/letters on the Shroud. To start with, I have exclusively sought literature on peer-review papers belonging to the Journal of Citation Reports (JCR). For those readers not familiar with the JCR, I will briefly say that in every field of expertise there is a group of top journals in which the members of a given scientific community publish their results. This takes place only after at least two colleagues have scrutinized that paper and if finally accepted, it can be considered that there are not sound mistakes or repetition of previous results. This means that authors are making a contribution to the advance of knolewdge in that area. Depending on the impact of the papers published on that journal, the JCR also provides a ranking. Usually, the higher the journal is in the ranking, the more strict are the conditions to get a paper published. Before someone comes with the case of Nature (#1 in the JCR) and the C14 I will say that the errors in the datation–if any- must be atributted to the sample selection stage, the only stage that peers could not scrutinize and had to give for granted. Never to any of the stages.\nWell, the only paper I have found that meets these standards is the paper by Marion in Opt. Eng. 37(8) 2308-2313 (August 1998). A quick consultation, indicates that in the field of Optics in 1998 there were 47 journals and Optical Engineering was in position #24. This means quite a good position in the ranking  and you can bet that the paper by Marion went through a strict filter and was only published because the methodology followed was -at that time- a standard one, widely used and accepted by the rest of the scientific community in the fields of optics and image analysis.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2011 at 6:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"After reading this paper, I see a serious attempt to overcome the difficulty of the gap between analogic/digital material while using a mathematical tool like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n“Many photographs of the face were digitized: a reproduction on film of the Enrie photograph (I931) and several others (negatives, slides, and paper prints) made by Vernon Miller in 1978 under various lighting conditions and in different wavelength bands (red, green, blue, IR).”\nAfter digitizing, he used PCA as a way to combine and extract the meaningful information from different wavelengths and sources. The outcome is a set of inscriptions obtained in an area around the face.\n“Before interpreting the graphical signs that the digital processing highlights, let us note that these signs are much larger (1.5 to 3 cm) than the fibers of the cloth (about 0.7 mm wide). This size is evidence of the fact that the letters are not artefacts due to the weaving of the cloth.”\nAs an expert, he was well aware of the things that usually happens with images\n“But the digitizing and processing techniques can create their own artefacts, especially aliasing effects. Precautions must be taken to minimize such effects in digitizing and processing periodic structures. such as a cloth. Note also a subjective artefact, called the Rorschach effect, which, for instance, makes shapes appear in randomly located stains on a paper. This effect is dangerous in interpreting inscriptions.”\nTo avoid this:\n“To avoid false interpretations, we used criteria for deciding whether the signs that we see can correspond to real writings:\nl. The signs are not isolated but they form groups.\n2. Their gray values are similar.\n3. They have approximatively the same size, thickness, slope, and fashion.\n4. They are correctIy aligned and periodically spaced.\n5. They have a significance because they form a word or a piece of word in a known language.\nIf these five conditions are simultaneously verified, the probability of an artefact becomes very small. “\nA final check:\n“To eliminate this possibility completely we made a final check: if we apply the same processing to a neighboring similar region and if this operation does not cause any graphical signs to appear, we finally decide that the group of signs must correspond to writings.”\nWe can discuss on how good is this method but I would like to stress the idea that if this procedure had not been an acceptable one (in 1998), the peers would have rejected his methodology, his results and his paper.\n\n","date":"October 28, 2011 at 6:36 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/10/28/paper-chase-sight-and-brain-and-shroud-of-turin-images/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Paper Chase: Sight and Brain and Shroud of Turin Images"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"I would like to focus the discussion on available facts and not on hidden agendas.

In my view, after reading it I think that further research regarding Rogers hypothesis is definitively needed. Some of the difficulties we have been discussing here can also be found in your paper, now expressed in his own words.\nOn the one hand, Rogers proposes a mechanism for image formation based on concentration gradients of amines due to diffusion. I have some difficulties with this but I also admit, that perhaps after all it could be possible. After all when he says that  Concentration gradients are also formed by depletion of reactant(s) as a result of chemical reactions. When reactants hit the cloth and react, they are not free to diffuse parallel to the cloth. They produce products only where they hit the cloth. The adjoining areas must be hit by other columns of reactants to produce a color. Remember, diffusion from a surface occurs as a front not as a growing hemispherical volume. You can have collimation normal to the emitting surface these columnns seem to me very close to a laminar flow model.\nHowever, if we admit diffusion as the major mechanism, we cannot admit that The image of the hair was probably largely a result of ammonia from the lungs as we read in page 13 and as a result,  Increased concentrations result in increased reaction rates. Did you ever wonder why the hair showed so much color? (page 7).\nThis would imply that while in the rest of the body, as amines are produced, a gradient appears and a reaction takes place, in the area of the face, amines first move from the lungs through mouth and nose and then react. That model implies a different behaviour for the area of the face (two steps: motion to the hair first followed by diffusion and subsequent reaction) and the rest of the body (only reaction due to diffusion).\nIf that were the case, it could be expected that the trail of preferential paths of those amines throughout the face could be detected. It is understood that the mechanism for this initial motion is gravity (we have heavy amines) so apart from those paths I would also expect a gradient between the different areas of the hair, since it is widely admitted that the head was not lying horizontally.\nFinally, I would also say that all the time Rogers assumes a maximum period of 36 hours for his reactions and he ignores how all these chemical reactions evolved after that.\nHowever, as a whole, I would say that Rogers hypothesis is in a good position in the ranking of explanations for the image fomation mechanism. Nevertheless, further research is needed to address some difficulties.\n\n","date":"August 13, 2012 at 6:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Yannick, please read the first comment of this post by Thibault\n\n","date":"August 13, 2012 at 12:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Daveb, honestly I don’t know and I also have difficulties with that quote by ROGERS regarding the diffusion mechanism\n\n","date":"August 13, 2012 at 7:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Daveb, that sounds reasonable\n\n","date":"August 14, 2012 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/12/thibault-heimburger-i-hope-now-that-nobody-will-claim-that-there-is-no-maillard-reaction-and-no-color-at-room-temperature/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thibault Heimburger:  I hope now that nobody will claim that there is no Maillard reaction and no color at room temperature."},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Thibault, thanks for this work. I have found it really interesting because I have learnt a lot on the Shroud at fiber level. Its comparison with the scorch clearly indicates their different origin.\nI would like to suggest you a further step of this work and it could be the development of a mathematical model describing the patterns present in the colouring of fibers, something that you have qualitatively already done. From figures 20 onwards it seems to me obvious the existance in the Shroud at fiber level, of a consistent pattern regarding the color, layout, grouping of fibers…that in my view, could be described mathematically with state-of-the-art algorithms.\nThe advantage of this is that any future claim on tentative methods that could explain the image could be evaluated on the basis of the mathematical pattern obtained when analyzed at fiber level. A quick mathematical test on similarity of fiber patterns could be the key for evaluating to which extent the new tentative method reproduces the characteristics of the Shroud.\nBesides, what we see in figure 20 onwards, is really interesting. The coloured fibers tend to group in clusters of coloured fibers including a certain number of them. The really interesting thing is that colourized areas tend to follow the profile of the fiber and do not jump from certain areas of a fiber to another fiber leaving uncolorized zones. Why.?\n Finally, Thibault you once mentioned new apportions on the heavy amines issue.

I have a n-th generation image of the Shroud someone gave to me so its origin and quality is dubtious. However, using a software that is freely available (Image-J http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html) that has also been commented in this blog and that allows 3D visualization, I have obtained that the flat heights (3D information) corresponding to the burnt areas are 20-30 times higher than those corresponding to the body.  Since this image is black and white, the presence of intense white areas (burnt areas) originates this big difference with human figure areas. These seems to me a plausible explanation.  We have a original image with 3D information and years/centuries later very white stains appear that in a B&W image like mine give 20-30 times higher heights (3D) values. However, I will not go any further because the validity of my small experiment is exactly zero due to the unknown origin of my own image. \nFor this reason, this is not but a comment based on a very dubtious image.

Regarding this point, I am only convinced around 75% because many things still remain unknown. One of the major reasons for that, is the way that research has been carried out all along these years. Someone has got access to some material (fibers, HD photos or any other) but results cannot be replicated because those materials are not freely available. Also, the researchers/scientists involved tend to appear too often in the media, thus taking the analysis of the Shroud out of the scientific forums and bringing the Shroud to tall shows on TV or newspapers’ “UFO&Mystery” section (apart from a very few number of serious works).\nThe point is that what is described in those few serious works, cannot be replicated by anyone and authors must be trusted 100%, being very difficult the exploration of alternative explanations for their findings if original material is not available for independent research. I can believe authors in about 75% for some very astonishing findings on the Shroud, but not 100% if other researchers do not independently reach the same conclusions.\nThis is a major difference when we come to a scientific approach if compared with any other “serious” research field.\nHowever, I also have a sociological positive indicator that makes me keep the probabilities in that 75% (and not reduce them). It is the position of the Catholic Church as a religious body, NOT as a scientific one. If we have a look at how the position of the Church has evolved in the question of relics during the last 100-150 years, we can conclude that slowly but intentionally, the cult to relics has been abandonned in the vast majority of cases. 200 years ago, in almost every Catholic Church and town in the old Europe there was a relic with some magical properties and a cult was performed around this relic. Now, only in a very few cases the cult and veneration associated to a relic still endures and in the rest (thousands of cases) it has simply been abandonned. The few relics that remain are like in the case of the Shroud of Turin, those which can exhibit strong -though maybe not definitive- historical credits. This is only my intuition and perhaps I am wrong, but I think that if the Church still goes on with exhibitions like the one we saw last year in Turin is because, after an inner research process, they have concluded that this cloth is likely to be the burial shroud of Jesus. But this is no more than a personal opinion that helps me reach what for me is a coherent figure (75%) for the estimation of probabilities\n\n","date":"December 7, 2011 at 2:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/07/why-do-we-think-it-is-an-image-of-jesus-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think it is an image of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Yannick, here it may go an answer. Nowadays in some Catholic countries like Philippines in Easter, in the frame of the Holy Friday religious celebrations they represent the crucifixion and some volunteers are hit like was Jesus, they wear a thorn crown and they even are “crucified” with ropes. These persons suffer a lot and need weeks to recover. It certainly was brought to Philippines by the Spanish. Nowadays, similar celebrations already take place in Spain, though not reaching so far as crucifiying someone like in  thePhilippines. This means that in the Middle Ages similar or you can bet that even more realistic celebrations used to take place at least in Spain, and in perhaps many others places of Europe.  Why not consider the possibility ( I am using my 25% of skepticism at this moment\n:-)) that in the frame of such celebrations -which in harder or softer versions are quite a lot of centuries old- they reproduced the crucifixition with all the details as gathered in the gospels and truly someone was killed? Who knows why… he volunteered for his sins, or because he needed to be punished for herecsy or….It is only one step beyond what we see nowadays in Philippines. In that context, the blood stains, the thorn crown…would appear in its correct place.\nI mean, the hypothesis of medieval forgery is compatible with the presence of blood and the rest of details, as you mention. If we come to the point of the crucifixion as a punishment and the argument that so many details had been forgotten since Roman times, I would answer that crucifixion was occasionally used in war times in the battlefield against enemies that had been captured.\nFor these reasons, in my opinion, addressing the issue of authenticity, later or sooner takes us to the image formation mechanism. Currently, the formation mechanism(s) are not fully understood, and therefore the Shroud cannot be replicated. After so many years, we can conclude that whatever that mechanism is, it is highly complex/sophisticated. This is also a strong argument against a medieval forgery because if with current technology we cannot do something like that, it seems even more difficult for some in the Middle Ages (this belongs to my 75% of plausibility :-)).\n\n","date":"December 7, 2011 at 4:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/07/why-do-we-think-it-is-an-image-of-jesus-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Why do we think it is an image of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Yannick: have a look at theseand tell me if it is not possible to account for all the details we see in the Shroud in the frame of these celebrations.

However let me draw your attention to two additional aspects:\n1. No directionality has been detected on the image which makes impossible the conventional use of a brush. Please, in this paper (*) you will find the results -among other things- of a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of the image which clearly indicates the lack of a preferential directionality, as could be expected from a more or less skilful artist using a very special brush.\n2. As it has been widely reported, the 3D effect is obtained by changing the fraction of coloured fibers by unit area, and all the coloured fibers have the same (more or less) intensity. Please note, that this would imply a medieval artist capable of colouring a linen fiber by fiber.\nREGARDING YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENTS:\nI do hope that you continue writing in this blog and that your next goodbyes to this blog, like the previous ones, are not definitive :-).

The outcome is a set of inscriptions obtained in an area around the face.\n“Before interpreting the graphical signs that the digital processing highlights, let us note that these signs are much larger (1.5 to 3 cm) than the fibers of the cloth (about 0.7 mm wide). This size is evidence of the fact that the letters are not artefacts due to the weaving of the cloth.”\nAs an expert, he was well aware of the things that usually happens with images\n“But the digitizing and processing techniques can create their own artefacts, especially aliasing effects. Precautions must be taken to minimize such effects in digitizing and processing periodic structures. such as a cloth. Note also a subjective artefact, called the Rorschach effect, which, for instance, makes shapes appear in randomly located stains on a paper. This effect is dangerous in interpreting inscriptions.”\nTo avoid this:\n“To avoid false interpretations, we used criteria for deciding whether the signs that we see can correspond to real writings:\nl. The signs are not isolated but they form groups.\n2. Their gray values are similar.\n3. They have approximatively the same size, thickness, slope, and fashion.\n4. They are correctIy aligned and periodically spaced.\n5. They have a significance because they form a word or a piece of word in a known language.\nIf these five conditions are simultaneously verified, the probability of an artefact becomes very small. “\nA final check:\n“To eliminate this possibility completely we made a final check: if we apply the same processing to a neighboring similar region and if this operation does not cause any graphical signs to appear, we finally decide that the group of signs must correspond to writings.”\nTwo additional results from Marion’s paper:\nAgainst having been painted\n“It is an isotropic image. The Fourier transform of the image shows no preferential frequencies, proving that no preferential direction exists in the image itself. Consequently, it is difficult to imagine that this image could have been made directly by a human hand.”\nThe letters are originated the same as the rest of the image\n“Although the physical nature of the letters is not known, curiously their fine structure in the photos is the same as that of the body image: the letters are also formed by the variations of the size and the intensity of the rods. This characteristic is difficult to explain, but it shows that the useful information required to decipher the inscriptions is entirely contained in the image pattern. This observation is fundamental to understanding the image processing method.”\n\n","date":"April 17, 2013 at 12:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/14/the-making-of-the-hd-image-for-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Making of the HD Image for the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"In my view, trying to replicate Marion’s work, published in a serious peer-review journal could be one of the first objectives in the frame of a major research plan.

I think a new C14 test can be the end of any  serious attempt to  analyze the Shroud. It just won’t work.\nSomeone mentioned here that he Archbishop is considering a new radiocarbon test. I hope they don’t do so, because in this last year, new evidences -after many previous ones- have arisen on the unappropiateness of C14, in general and more particularly in the case of the Shroud.\nAmong the last ones, in my view, the identification of a trend with solid statistical techniques and published in a serious JCR peer-reviewed journal is by far the most relevant. By the way, to be fair, coauthored by Fanti. The connection with the C14 test comes when we see the UV images of the sample area after a PCA analysis, as described in the paper by Morgan of last summer.\nThe PC’s in a PCA usually describe a mechanism that is not detectable at first sight. If in this paper we have a look at the first PC image  (UV) of the area, we can easily distinguish a gradient due to an unknown mechanism operating. This mechanism could simply be associated to the different degrees of handling, rubbing, and touching by millions of hands throughout the centuries. But the point is that this photo was taken (by Barrrie, I think) before the C14 test of 1988 and in it a gradient can be easily detected. Now, almost 30 years after the photo was taken, the same gradient is detected in the form of a trend in the C14 counts of the sample!!\nThis implies that whatever the mechanism responsible of the gradient was (most probably some sort of biocontamination) it could not be removed from the sample, and reappeared again in the form of a trend when C14 atoms were counted. Please note, that this would  be compatible with a medieval reweaving and also that in the most recent general literature on C14 we have largely commented here, the major problems in all cases are associated to similar problems: low effective methods of removing contamination of  any type prior the test. I do not know if this limitation will ever be overcome, but currently it is not, so highly contaminated objects like the Shroud cannot be appropiately dated with this technique.\nGiven this fact, I think it is time to move towards other approaches in Shroud research but always following truly scientific protocols and methodologies like peer-review and traceable chain of custody.\n\n","date":"April 6, 2013 at 9:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/05/a-committee-far-removed-from-padua/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"A Committee Far Removed from Padua"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"To start with the discussion concepts like randomness and infinite, should be clearly defined beforehand, something than at the current point is far from being clear.

I don´t have important difficulties with  the nature of the chemical reactions involved under the hypothesis by Rogers. I could say the same if vapors were also sweat or any other product of decomposition.\nHowever, in my opinion,  major difficulties arise regarding the motion of gases.\nThe hypothesis of Rogers can only be understood in the frame of a very low emission rate of gases from the body, with a density smaller than air and slowly flowing in laminar regime. That applies to the frontal image. (The back image perhaps was formed with other mechanisms involved?). According to this model, from each point of the body a strictly vertical motion of reactive gases from the body impact the cloth (impurity layer?, outermost part of the fibers?). Then a (Maillard?) chemical reaction takes place, and the surface of the cloth gets colorized.\nIn my view, this is the only model which according to the basic laws of Fluid Mechanics clould explain the vertical correspondence between each point of the body and the image. For this reason, I find extremely interesting the recent post regarding Ray Schneider’s statement on the vertical directionality of the image. This fact could really make sense for\ni)the chemical part of Rogers hypothesis (or sweats/differente gases)\nii) and the –in my view- only possible description according to the laws of fluid mechanics.\nHowever, after reading your post, I noticed that Rogers also had a model for the motion of gases, that in some aspects I am afraid cannot fit in what we know about fluids.\n1.“Gaseous reactive amines can be lost by diffusion through the porous cloth, reducing concentrations and reaction rates inside the cloth. However, it has long been recognized that the images of the hair, moustache and beard are anomalous. The density of the image is greatest in those areas. That can easily be explained by the inhibition of vapor diffusion through a porous mat of hair. Ammonia is first evolved from the lungs. Therefore, its concentration would have been highest in the vicinity of the nose and mouth, and its diffusion would have been retarded by the moustache and beard. By the time heavy decomposition amines appear, the body will have cooled. The surface area of cloth is large and higher-molecular-weight decomposition amines absorb strongly. All of these phenomena would cause a RAPID REDUCTION IN AMINES CONCENTRIATION AWAY FROM THE CONTACT POINTS AND THE NOSE-MOUTH AREA.”\nRogers is thinking of a diffusion mechanism inside the cloth or through a porous mat of hair or from the lungs into the moustache and beard. This is in conflict with a laminar flow from the body and impacting and reacting on the cloth. The result of a difussion would be a  blurred image and a clear point by point vertical correspondence between body and cloth could not be expected.\n2.“Most of the very volatile ammonia diffuses out through the nose and mouth soon after death. This fact may explain the darker image color between the nose and the mouth AND THE PENETRATION OF IMAGE COLOR IN THE VICINITY OF THE HAIR.” (Note : Here, Rogers made reference to a possible image of the hair visible on the back side of the cloth).\nAt this point, I think that Rogers is proposing a horizontal motion of volatile ammonia (with lower molecular weight than air)  towards the hair. Being lighter than sourrounding air a vertical (and not horizontal) motion should be expected.\n3.“The lower density of the hair makes it UNLIKELY that large amounts of either HEAT OR RADIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN THE HAIR. This suggests that vapor diffusion was involved in image formation, because any fibrous mat, INCLUDING HAIR, reduces the rate of diffusion of gases. Fiber mats are used for insulation, because they reduce gas diffusion and heat transfer by convection.” (Note : This is a very strong argument from Rogers against any kind of hypothesis involving a burst of energy during the resurrection of Christ. For Rogers, because of it’s very different structure versus a human body, the high quality of the image of the hair would be IMPOSSIBLE to explain if they would have been caused by some kind of heat or radiation. And remember folks that it’s an authentic expert in radiation who said that !).\nThe same that above\n4.“When a heavier-than-air foreign gas is diffusing into air in a fibrous mat, the concentration of the gas WILL INCREASE IN THE HAIR. More gas will diffuse through the pores of the cloth in the area of the hair. Such a mechanism would explain why the hair is clearly visible in the image and why it is visible on the back of the cloth. The observation of image color at the location of the hair on the back side of the cloth, strongly suggest that a gas heavier than air was involved in image formation.” (Note : This last observation has not been confirmed yet. There is probably something on the back side of the cloth corresponding to the hair on the front side, but the exact nature of this image still wait to be confirmed. Rogers mentioned this possible image of the hair on the back side of the cloth on the base of a testimony from monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti that was taken from the report of the 2002 restoration, where he mentioned that the only part of the image that his visible on the back surface of the cloth is the hair (ref. : Rogers book). Fanti and Maggiolo have confirmed this claim in a 2004 paper (along with the image of the moustache and beard and maybe also the hands), but this work has been criticize by many researchers and this question is still left open (especially for the exact nature of those images). Anyway, Rogers estimated that if those images are really there (and at first sight, it seem so, especially for the images of the hair, the beard and the moustache), his personal hypothesis involving a gaseous diffusion through the cloth would be the most likely way to explain them and that’s why he talk about a possible image of the hair on the back side of the cloth).\nAgain, a diffusion mechanism would  yield a blurred image.\n5.“The early appearance and rapid diffusion of low-molecular-weight ammonia from the nose and mouth might help explain the greater amount of image color between the nose and mouth, in the beard, AND INTO THE NEIRBY HAIR. It will also diffuse through the cloth more quickly and reach the back side of the cloth in greater concentration. Ammonia will diffuse about 20 cm through air while cadaverine is diffusing only 6 cm.”\nAgain, the problem of horizontal motion towards the hair and diffusion/blurred image.\nIn my view, all this represents important limitations which perhaps further research may contribute to solve.\n\n","date":"June 14, 2012 at 2:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"\ncolinsberry :The problem with any imaging model that involves gaseous diffusion is that gas molecules behave like snooker balls. They travel in a straight line until they strike another ball, then come off at an angle, travel some more in a straight line, collide, come off at another angle. After a relatively few collisions we can safely say that the direction of movement of molecules is random, but we can safely predict they gradually get mixed up with all the other molecules, and “spread out in all directions”.\nIt’s all very well talking about mean free path, but at atmospheric pressure the mean free path before a particular molecule strikes another one is very small, and if the molecule is a minor constituent it will tend to collide with an “air molecule”, i.e. nitrogen, oxygen etc, rather than its own type,\n\nThis is basically true unless a laminar regime with a very low Reynolds number (I would say below 10) can be established. And I also agree that it is in contradiction with the gas diffusion model as described by Rogers\n\n","date":"June 15, 2012 at 1:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/14/gas-diffusion-and-the-banding-effect/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Gas Diffusion and the Banding Effect"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Anoxie, very good questions:\n1st.

Regarding the SHroud, it will be almost impossible to reach any further than this, because just like in the case of the Chalice, it will be impossible to prove beyond any doubt that it was Jesus burial cloth.\nHowever, just ilke in the case of the Chalice, if it were proven that it comes from the Middle East and belongs to the first Century, it is highly reasonable to think that it once wrapped the body of Jesus.\nAs far as this point, the comparisons between the Chalice and the Shroud are obvious and belong to the field of History. However, in the case of the SHroud we have an additional issue, that may explain why it is much better known that the Chalice: its possible link to the Resurrection, either through a natural chemical process (Maillard reaction or other) taking place hours before this unique Event or as Fanti, Jackson and others claim, due to the Event itself.\nRegarding new experiments, in my view, the Church will only allow them after preliminary analysis carried out privately.

This could be easily be written in C++ or R and could represent a step forward in addressing the “I think I see” issue.\n1. In the first place, using  Image J  import a high resolution image of the Shroud, of course with a traceable origin.\n2. Save it as black and white and as text. Doing that you turn your image into a matrix, being its values the intensity of the image’s pixels ranging from 0  (black) to 255 (white). Any value in between is some kind of grey.\n3. Open a  for/do   type loop and sweep in that matrix rectangles of varying size.\n4. For each rectangle,  identify a reference background color (value between 0 and 255). This could be done as an average or median of the rectangle of using wider meaningful areas on the Shroud.\n5. In each reactangle, using a classical  if then , convert values below the reference of point 4 into 0 and values above into 255. This will increase contrast.\n6. Each rectangle will look like a chess table, with black and white small squares, corresponding to the pixels in that rectangle.\n7. In paralell, a database should have been created with letters and numbers and coins, flowers etc…depicted for each rectangle size as a combination of black and white squares (This could take some time)\n8. Each rectangle and number of black and white squares will be compared to this database using for example, Self-Organizing Maps, random forests or cluster analysis.\n9. If a positive match is found, it will be compared with the  possibility of finding it by pure chance. \nLet’s put an example: imagine we are at this current step of the major loops analyzing a 3 pixels x 2 pixels rectangle and we have 2 black squares and 4 white, after the conversion of point 5. If a L needs 4 white pixels to be there and we have found a positive match, the probability the white pixels have arranged by chance as a L is 1/(6x5x4x3).\nOf course, this only represents an initial approach and many points could be improved. This would take some hours or perhaps days of CPU but any result that might emerge would have associated an objective probability.\n\n","date":"August 17, 2012 at 9:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/16/i-think-i-see-another-different-nail-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"I think I see another, different nail on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Very interesting connection, Yannick.

Since he wrote his book the perspectives that scientists are exploring have substantially changed. For example, 15 years ago or even 10years ago, nobody would be interesting in studying anything that may have happened before the Big Bang because not only space and matter but also time began with the Big Bang . However, now we have leading scientists like Penrose exploring what he thinks are gravitational waves originated before the Big Bang. When we come to the fate of the universe, more than 73% of matter is dark matter……that nobody knows what it is. However it is considered to be crucial to elucidate whether the universe will expand forever or the gravitational forces will bring it to a Big Crunch. Coming to the multiverse theory….it is a theory with no evidence so far. It is used as an explanation for the fact that the exact values of six cosmological constants -and not any others- are responsible for the universe as it is, and for the laws that have made possible after an evolution process, life and conciousness. The multiverse theory is used to explain that if you throw your dices an infinite number of times, you will find by pure chance the only universe -ours- in which these six cosmological constants adopt the exact values that make consciousness possible. The rest of “results” with your dice configure an infinite number of empty universes -that is,  a multiverse- with “wrong” values associated with those six cosmological constants. But, I would like to stress the idea that there is not a single physical evidence on this theory so far. Gibbs bosson and the many particles yet to be discovered in the future in CERN also pose a strong challenge to Typlers theories, since the final structure of matter is far from being understood.\nTo summarize, Typler just made a nice story with the ingredients he had at hand, but most of them are currently under discussion.\nIn sharp contrast with this, we have the case of saint Agustin who in the fifth century was able to write in his book Confessions that when God created the world He also created time. He was able to reach this conclussion just by reading the book of Genesis.

In this sense, from a scientific point of view, it is doubtlessly a major challenge. I think this cannot be denied.\nAdditionally, it is highly controversial due to to all its implications. Addressing such an explosive combination (true scientific challenge+Controversial) is a very, very difficult matter.\nIn this sense, I find strong similarities with a recent subject: climate change. Perhaps, we could learn a few lessons from it. Only after a centralized body like United Nations thru IPCC started a systematic scientific approach providing free access to all available data and making its way only thru peer-reviewed journals, a clear and solid picture has appeared on the fact that Mankind is affecting climate and Earth is getting warmer. In this process, all agenda driven researches have been put in their place. Of course, they still have some small influence but their arguments are not scientific (now they have moved to conspiration theories)  and the true solid fact cannot be denied any longer.\nI am afraid that in the case of the Shroud, we are still in the 80’s of climate research history when anyone could start a research and reach a conclusion by himself with his own piece of evidence. At that time, a great deal of researchers were also “climate stars” on the media -just like current “Shroud stars”-and used to attend talk shows on TV too often, while writing few JCR papers.\nUnless in the Shroud issue a similar step towards a centralized&coordinated research and open proof custody system is not given, researchers will attend TV shows and feed newspapers with more and more incredible headlines. At that time, acting like that was also helpful to raise some funds to go on with that particular piece of research. Just like with the Shroud nowadays. I think we have already had enough of that. This way is the best to keep the research on the Shroud in an endless “murkier than ever” status.\nThat said, in the absence of such a system, I hope that Dr. DiLAzzaro could get forward with his research and address the challenges he has got ahead like trying to reproduce the 3D effect with his laser.\nMerry Christmas to all from Spain.\n\n","date":"December 24, 2011 at 9:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/24/second-update-to-msnbcs-cosmic-log-posting-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Second Update to MSNBC’s Cosmic Log Posting on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Too many paragraphs to reach an obvious, years old and well established conclusion: we dont know yet how the image was formed.

On the contrary, a gradient would be expected with the linen surface closer to the higher electricity potential pole having a higher degree of coloration, the inner layers being also coloured, and finally the last layer exhibiting this tiny imprint known as “double superficiality”.\nIn the absence of any degree of coloration in the inner layers of the Shroud, it is impossible to explain the formation mechanism as originated by a corona discharge breaking the continuity of electric charges flowing through and crossing the Shroud.\nI mean, double superficiality and corona discharge are mutually not compatible.\n\n","date":"February 5, 2013 at 6:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/05/teaser-of-the-day-5-double-superficiality-expialidocious/","cat":"teaser_of_the_day","title":"Teaser of the Day (#5):  Double Superficiality Expialidocious"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"If those images are not the HAL-9000 images, they really have a very high resolution…What seems to me fascinating of their work (in a peer-reviewed, JCR journal) is that all the affected fibers have the same degree of colouring and it is only the proportion of coloured fibers by unit area that provides a 3D effect to the naked eye.

In one of these papers (Riani et al., 2010) the authors even identify a trend from the outer to the inner part of the Shroud. The reason why to me is much more interesting this second group of statistical reasons is that even if original linen were sampled, it could also be expected a lack of homogeneity and also, most probably, due to the lack of conclusive results a new cycle of useless discussions could start.\nThis is because nobody exactly knows what the impact of the very specific chain of historical events the Shroud has gone through (millions of people rubbing it for centuries, fires, humidity changes…..) could have on the C14 test. For this reason, even in the case that the Shroud were authentic, I would not be too confident that a new test, although correctly carried out by standards valid for other type of samples, would yield a 1st century datation.

In this blog we have largely commented that the 3D effect of the image is obtained because the number of coloured fibers per unit area is different. The observed varying intensity of the coloured areas is due to the different fractions of coloured fibers affected and not to the different intensity in each fiber. In this sense, a fiber may be coloured and its neighbour not.\nThis is the explanation so far of the 3D effect. Now, if you locate the colourizing effect not in the fibers but on an impurity layer above the whole cloth, it is much more difficult to individualize the colourizing effect and describe it as a proportion of affected fibers since in my opinion, the impurities layer must have a continuity covering more than one single fiber and one would expect a more continuous pattern in the colour. I don`t know if Rogers ever addressed this issue….\nRegarding, the isotropy issue, I have been thinking about it,….. and yes, you might have a point….because the laws of fluid mechanics theoretically at least, could allow a vertical flow of gases from the body in a very slow laminar regime so that in a quiet and confined atmosphere, like the one between the shroud and a body there is a chance for that type of flow.\nThis could be easily simulated with any CFD code (Fluent, StarCCM+…..)\n\n","date":"May 13, 2012 at 6:59 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/12/comment-of-the-week-by-thibault-heimburger/","cat":"challenge","title":"Comment of the Week by Thibault Heimburger"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Yannick, honestly I don`t know but if I have to hypothesize, I would expect the impurities layer to have originated at the linen preparation stage, and in this sense to have approximarely the same density all over the cloth.

For example, you can bet that in the scientific climate community nobody would even think of discussing creative analysis of data (ilke the creative analysis of images of the Shroud we see from time to time) if those data are not freely available to anyone and are open to in-depth scrutinization.\nFor these reasons Dan, I have to disagree with you: in my view this is not relevant at all to the Dawkins Challenge. He is a scientist and will only hold a discussion with scientists.  \nI would also ilke to add that Roger’s theory is a solid theory (although not a fact yet). Its good position in the ranking of plausability is due exactly to the fact that Rogres approach has gone through the peer review system and he even shared his own material for independent research.

And in this particular case, since there are lighter bands on each side of the face, it’s very probable that there were not many impurities present in these areas in order to produce a coloration anyway. So, in these particular areas, it is possible that there was not much gas present and not many impurities (and maybe a good distance between the corpse and the cloth).\nPlease note Yannick that if gas coming from the nose and mouth was trapped by the hair, that is, it is not emitted completely vertically, this is in contradiction with the vertical isotropy model defended among others by Ray Schneider in a recent post here. Honestly, I don’t know if the vertical isotropy aspect is a true fact of the image, but I just want to point out that if it were so, is in contradiction with an horizontal gas diffusion model from the nouse and mouth to the hair. In my opinion, the model by Rogers with a body emitting amines that react with a layer of impurities of the cloth, makes more sense if we think of a vertical flow of gas moving in a laminar regime. In fact, in my view, it is the only option. A horizontal motion of the gas from the nouse to to the hair would be very hard to explain according to the laws of fluid mechanics.\n\n","date":"June 8, 2012 at 2:11 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/07/marcel-alonso-on-rogers-impurity-layer/","cat":"challenge","title":"Marcel Alonso on Rogers’ Impurity Layer"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Hummm, after reading so many theories, I think I am going to put forward a theory by myself also.

It also seems to be so for Collin Berry.\nI usually act as a reviewer for a couple of JCR journals and it seems to me very unlikely the hypothesis of a conspiration in 1988 around the Nature paper to falsify results for non scientific reasons. Publishing a paper in Nature is a very diffciult task and only very solid works get published (OK, I know about the case of the corean guy!). Perhaps some methodological mistakes were made at the sampling stage, but as a whole, I tend to think that according to the knowledge that was available (crucial remark!) in 1988 the results were correct.\nHOWEVER\nAt that time it was believed that the C14 test was appliable to almost anything. Now we know that the C14 test has got its limitations, and more specifically, when applied to ancient linens, relevant and serious studies (1) published a decade later indicated that the C14 test is not appropiate to datate ancient linens like the Shroud. This is how science moves forward.\nMy position is that the C14 test was carried out correctly but NOW (and not in 1988) we know that the C14 methodology is not appliable to the Shroud. For that reason, I think that the issue of the age of the Shroud still remains open.\nIn my opinion, this is why the Church who always gets very good scientific advice, will never repeat a C14 test and will move to more promising and breaking-edge technologies and methodologies to elucidate the origin of the Shroud.\n(1) H.E.

For this reason, as far as I am concerned, to judge his apportions I will stick to those criteria. In the light of that, out of all his publications he has freely decided to publish in this blog, only the 5 papers in  J. Imaging Sci. Technol. can considered to be true scientific contributions because this journal is in position 15 out of 19 in the JCR in the field of IMAGING SCIENCE & PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY. However, I consider that exhibiting these 5 papers to support things like resurrection, Medjugorge, supernatural  and so on which go far beyond Fanti’s scientific works, simply is not either scientific….. nor honest.\nThough a Catholic myself, I think this approach in which some scientific results which belong to a specific field (image Analysis) are used to explain religious believes that currently neither FAnti nor anyone else can demonstrate scientifically, makes a lot of harm.

In this sense, I would say that the true scientifc challenge –and I connect here with Russ’s previous post- is developing an ad-hoc methodology for dating ancient Middle East linens. I mean, at this moment, addresing the problem of the dating of the Shroud requires at this moment to develop a specific methodology which –unfortunately- at this moment does not exist.\nThis would need a major international and coordinated effort with a high number of ancient linens and then develop specific and accurate methodologies. The main point would be to find a set of indicators in the linen composition which could only be associated to a specific period or area. The composition of the ground where the linen was grown has a specific chemistry that most surely can be tracked to the composition of the linen , through rare isotopes. Additionally, in the composition of the atmosphere of the 1st century there are certain compounds in proportions that can be known analyzing ancient ice cores. This also should leave a specific track in a 1st century linen. All this means promising methodologies to be fully developed yet.

A chemical mechanism or a radiation/energy field both can account for only outer part colouring, I should add that only after DiLazzaro’s work a radiation mechanism has been proven to fulfill this condition. Previous works by Fazio and Rogers foresaw for any radiation/energy field mechanism a complete penetration and therefore colouring of the fibers cores. This was the main point for ruling out any energy or radiation-based explanation.\nDespite this, both chemical and radiative explanations, still lack of scientifically sound explanations for the 3D information, e.g. why and how the intensity of these mechanisms depend on the distance to the body. Generally speaking, a radiative/energy field mechanism can be expected to vary with distance but -I agree with you in this- specific and systematic experiments at different distances should be carried out and then evaluate if they can reproduce the intensity/distance ratio observed in the Shroud.\nRegarding your call for prudency I also agree 100%\n\n","date":"November 12, 2011 at 7:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Anyway I would like to thank you for the quotes and links you have provided in this blog, mainly regarding the fact that weight is acting in a distinctable manner in the dorsal image formation.\n\n","date":"November 12, 2011 at 7:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/11/paper-chase-the-findings-of-robert-bucklin/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Paper Chase: The Findings of Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Yannick, regarding your quote #26 I could suggest you a very simple test with the photos you have taken on the ground leaves.

I have been trying to explain the same idea in some comments I have been writing here during the last year.\nYour analysis of the Positive Secondary Ions plot seems basically correct and if we move to the Negative Secondary Ions things even look worse since the differences between the number of counts for most elements (but H) in the Jerusalem and Shroud sample shows values or roughly one order of magnitude (ten times more in the case of Jerusalem sample).\nHowever, the problem I find here is not these apparent discrepancies.\nPerhaps, if a true experienced expert in comparing limestones using spectra had a look at these ones, he would say that discrepancies are in the range of what can be reasonably been expected for two samples with the same origin. But I am not an expert on this field and simply I don’t know.\nWhat I am missing here is the interpretation and validation of these spectra by truly experiences eyes in the field of limestone comparation before publication. That’s what we call peer-review.\nIn the absence of this, the widely spred claims on the aragonite issue lack any validity since all the literature developed in the last years is based on these only two charts originally published in Biblical Archeology Review.\nPD.

I mean, at this moment, addresing the problem of the dating of the Shroud requires at this moment to develop a specific methodology which –unfortunately- at this moment does not exist.\nThis would need a major international and coordinated effort with a high number of ancient linens and then develop specific and accurate methodologies. The main point would be to find a set of indicators in the linen composition which could only be associated to a specific period or area. The composition of the ground where the linen was grown has a specific chemistry that most surely can be tracked to the composition of the linen , through rare isotopes. Additionally, in the composition of the atmosphere of the 1st century there are certain compounds in proportions that can be known analyzing ancient ice cores. This also should leave a specific track in a 1st century linen. All this means promising methodologies to be fully developed yet. In my opinion, efforts should move in this direction and not on trying to get new C14 tests.”\n**********\nThe main idea I wanted to convey is that to reach reliable results, ad-hoc methodologies are yet to be developed with a database of ancient linens using trace elements and also isotopes just like Bill points out in his answer. In this sense, isotope concentrations from ice cores may also be helpful for datation.\nI partially  agree with the difficulty of the source of trace elements but I also think that the results the authors provide in Table 1 of their paper are rather robust. A second recent paper (in this case with cotton(*)) shows that particular combinations of trace elements can  allow a correct identification of the state (in USA) the cotton comes from  in 81% of  the cases. In this case, the authors obtain “results of very clear and distinct clusters with no overlap”. I think that this sounds promising. \nTo summarize, my position is that the use of  trace element/isotopes analysis represent a field to be explored and in the frame of a serious long-term research could yield some interesting results.\nThanks.\n(*) Emily R.

He has also identified DNA corresponding to a variety of animals, including an extinct type of bird not present in current-day catalogues. However, the most interesting part of his presentation was when he showed the results associated to human DNA. He has identified DNA to human linages from all over the world, although the most abundant is DNA corresponding to prevalent populations from the Arabic peninsula (semitic) and both sides of the Mediterranean. In the slide he showed,  these three major human linages converged in the area of Egypt~Israel~Jordan~Syria.\nSeemingly, he has used DNA from the sticky tapes.\nAnother interesting presentation was the one given by Orit Shamir, from the Israel Department of Antiquities. She is an expert in ancient textiles of the Middle East and clearly ruled out the possibility that the Shroud could have been manufactured in Israel during Roman times. She gave many solid reasons to support that conclusion, all of them based on her expertise on ancient textiles, thus posing a new challenge to those defending its authenticity.\nRegarding the HAL9000 high resolution images, the group of Turin thinks that since they have been taken in a non-continuous way, that is, each photograph only covers a part of the Shroud, the light conditions change and putting together all the partial images would not be realistic. This seems to be one of the reasons not to release these high resolution images.  Their current challenge is to do some sort of continuous scanning of the Shroud that would enable a whole homogeneous analysis of the pixels.\nPaolo di Lazzaro goes on with his research on lasers. A quick look in ScienceDirect indicates that he is author of more than 100 papers on lasers in peer-reviewed indexed JCR journals. Surprisingly enough, most of them are not related to shroud studies whatsoever. In the last years, by fine-tunning the operational conditions of lasers impacting on linens, he has been able to reproduce an increasing number of aspects observable on the Shroud. Whatever, this may mean it is worthwhile to follow his research.\nThe Spanish members of the CES prsented the chemical analysis of the dust they have extracted from the sudarium of Oviedo. The results are truly interesting.\nMarzia Boi has reanalyzed the photographs of pollens corresponding to the STURP period and has clearly identified some major errors on the type of plant they belong to.\nFinally, Jose Luis Rodriguez gave a most interesting presentation on the analysis frame needed for a comprehensive study of the Shroud. He is an independent senior consultant in aviation and has imported some breaking edge methodology used in his field of expertise (the concept of system) to study the Shroud.\n\n","date":"September 17, 2014 at 4:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/12/surprising-paper-out-of-bari-plant-dna-studies-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"article","title":"Surprising Paper out of Bari: Plant DNA Studies on the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"gabriel","post":"Recently, archeologists have unearthed in Spain one of the oldest representations of Christ dating back to the IV century.

Conti in the Italian version I am afraid is not correctly captured in the English translation we see in the post. In fact, Prof. Conti is AGAINST the idea of the Shroud being medieval.\nA quick search indicates that PierLuigi Conti has got eight papers in JCR journals which at least, speaks in favour of his scientific profile. However, it would be great if those original raw figures from Tucson laboratory never made public before, could now be freely granted to anyone to corroborate his conclusions after an open discussion. I am afraid that as many other things in this world of the Shroud (photos, samples…) this will never happen….\nAt this point, I would have a question for the authors: In a recent peer-reviewed paper (1) the authors show that Arizona data belonged to different subsamples. Have the mathematicians consulted for this documentary taken this into account?\nNevertheless, the most interesting thing is that again, someone independently states that when you consider the entire Shroud – four yards of linen – “we could have a ripple hundreds or even several thousand years”. That is, after   the paper by Morgan where he analyzed the UV image of the test area, and after this recent peer-reviewed paper (1) once again  we have a trend.
