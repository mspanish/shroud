{"resources":[{"author":"rosetta","post":"Sharon and Dana, the fabric on Canvas is very expensive, then the package and the mailmanand all the years Ray worked on this. I just got my order from I am the way 2. And it is beautiful. It took 7 days to get the painting over here to the Netherlands. And believe me I am Happy with my birthday present my husband gave to me. It increase my faith in Jesus(Jehoshua Ha Mesiach) And what Ray has done, well I’ll think Jesus choose him,a real Artist with vision, and that knowledge came also from the Lord himself. We are living in a time that the anti Christ could reveal himself. And know we know hoe Jesus look like and there will be no mistake for Christians. Most of you love to pay those TV preachers who tell you everything in place except for the real truth.With men it is all impossible, but with Jesus anything is possible.Take for example youtube, everyone makes movies to get His or Her truth.But no one has the truth than Jesus alone, seeking the truth and you will find all the answers.Ray pointed out how Jesus was tortured for you and my mistakes. For that reason alone everyone should be grateful. Thank you Ray for many years of work on the ShroudJesus bless you and all who stood by you.Greeting From The NetherlandsRosetta","date":"March 19, 2014 at 11:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/the-real-face-of-jesus-ray-downing-suing-ae-owner-of-the-history-channel/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Real Face of Jesus: Ray Downing Suing A&E, Owner of the History Channel"}]}
