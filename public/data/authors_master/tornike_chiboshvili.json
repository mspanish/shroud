Obviously, next time Dr Dawkins or other scholars repeat the statement that Shroud is an hoax, they have to face with your challenge.First step was done, the next should be  spreading this challenge everywhere, blogosphere, websites, papers, conferences, and so on.At the same time, I am happy you don’t consider the text proposed at Valencia as cast in stone. As you know, in Valencia I suggested to add some “numbers” to avoid a vague definition of, e.g. the superficiality  of body image.This is because in the case of superficiality we have a number of experimental evidences. On the one hand we have the very important results of Rogers who was unable to measure the thickness of the many colored ghosts pellicle because of the diffraction limitation of the optical microscope he used. This means the colored thickness was smaller than the shortest visible wavelength, 410 nm.  On the other hand, we have the result of the superficiality paper published in Journal of Imaging Science and Technology (2010) that estimates experimentally the colored thickness as 200 nm +- 200 nm.So, in this case we may agree on a range of coloration between 200 and 400 nm (i.e. 0,2-0,4 micrometers) approximately.It isn’t an academic cavil. Making a numerical statement on superficiality allows to avoid the possibility that a scholar trying a “Nickell like” experiment comes to say: – I achieved a ten-micrometer color thickness, so it does not penetrate below the fiber (which is 20 micrometer thick) and I matched your characteristic no. 2 –A characteristic more that maybe considered for insertion is connected with the forensic details unknown in the Middle Age, for example the presence of exudates and high levels of bilirubin mixed with blood, which would be consistent with a haemolytic process caused by torture. The bilirubin is only visible by using UV lamps, such as those used by policemen to detect organic traces. These were obviously unavailable in the MiddleAges.Discussion is open!.In any case, apart from minor adjustement, the most important fact is that a challenge started having a general agreement. Unanimity is not possible for humans, but a general agreement is.  Thank you David for this effort and remarkable result.All the bestPaolo Di Lazzarohttp://www.shroud-enigma.com/Valencia/image-characteristics-%20consensus-shroud-of-turin.html#:)","date":"May 4, 2012 at 12:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/04/the-rush-limbaugh-of-shroud-science/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Rush Limbaugh of Shroud Science"},{"author":"tornike_chiboshvili","post":"I’m sorry, but I do not know English, I’m from Georgia, but I’m working on this issue in Georgia successfully, thank you very much! *","date":"May 4, 2012 at 12:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/04/the-rush-limbaugh-of-shroud-science/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Rush Limbaugh of Shroud Science"},{"author":"tornike_chiboshvili","post":"Now British scholar pours water on ‘fake’ papyrus text that claimed Jesus had a wifehttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2207038/British-scholar-says-papyrus-claiming-Jesus-married-fake.html","date":"September 25, 2012 at 12:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/24/when-asses-flew/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"When Asses Flew"},{"author":"tornike_chiboshvili","post":"georgia Tbilisi  :)","date":"May 4, 2012 at 12:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/04/the-rush-limbaugh-of-shroud-science/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Rush Limbaugh of Shroud Science"}],"opinion":[{"author":"tornike_chiboshvili","post":"DAVID: Why worry? There are big names like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and others writing best sellers attacking religion.ELAINE: Many scientists don’t want to be perceived as having any connection with the new atheists.
