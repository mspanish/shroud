My next article will discuss the Shroud, and the evidence that is most ignored.  I spoke with Mark Antonacci just before he published his book in 2,000.  One of my brothers arranged for me to speak with him.  I was the first person to challenge, in print (Oct. 1988), the radiocarbon tests, based on the fact that the Shroud had been exposed to spoke from the 1532 fire.  I have some very unusual anecdotes regarding the Shroud.  I will explain these on my next column.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2014 at 11:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/01/remembering-shroud-blood-scientist-dr-john-h-hellera-guest-posting-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Remembering Shroud Blood Scientist Dr. John H.
