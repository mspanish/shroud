{"art":[{"author":"randwulf","post":"I just finished reading “Heaven Is For Real” and have been introduced to the work of Akiane Kramarik.  The book is amazing and Akiane appears to be a “wunderkind” prodigy.  However, I have not yet had time to think through their messages.  I, too, wondered if anyone had compared their portrait of Jesus with the Shroud of Turin.\nOne thing that disturbed me in Colton’s account of Jesus’ “markers” (wounds) was that he specified they were in the palms of His hands and not in his wrists (as in the Shroud).  It is said that if they were in the palms the weight of His body would have ripped His hands loose from the cross (unless He were also tied with ropes, as you see in some pictures – but why would the Romans nail a victim AND tie him?  I’ve got to do some research).  On the other hand, if the nails were in the wrists (and the Greek language allows for the wrists to be considered part of the hands), the bones there would have held the weight of the body.  Then again, maybe Colton wasn’t being as specific as the book seems to indicate?\nAnother thing that I would like more information on is that Colton said everyone in Heaven except Jesus had wings.  I have always considered pictures of angels with wings as just the earth-bound artists’ symbolic attempt to convey to us that angels could fly. Also, the “It’s a Wonderful LIfe” thing about angels earning their wings is just a Hollywood plot device for “feel-good” shows.  Colton, however, indicated that not only angels but also humans there have wings (and halos, too).  On earth birds and airplanes need wings to provide lift from the wind, but why would they be needed in Heaven?  I’m sure the Burpo family is getting a gazillion emails and letters, so I don’t have much hope of finding out from them at this point If they know.  Of course, I’ll need to ask the Lord about all of this.\nAs for Akiane, her paintings are absolutely beautiful.  I don’t know what to think about her message and I have no comment at this point.  As a Christian, I did find it disturbing when I visited the gallery on her website  that she is also painting other religious figures such as HIndus and talking about respecting our “religious crossroads” and everyone coming together in unity.  While to most people that sounds very nice, I did have some reservations about it and I will not comment until I’ve had the oppoturinity to see what she is really saying.\nI just wanted to share these thougts while I was here because they are things that need to be considered. Best wishes to all!\n\n","date":"June 22, 2011 at 4:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
