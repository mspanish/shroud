Got me thinking and wondering what is the opinion of the participants on this site: was there more blood centuries ago on the Shroud?\nLook at the http://plastanica.blogspot.com/, and espc. this Serbian example:\n– Плаштаница скопског архиепископа Јована – 14. век.

Thank u Charles! I am familiar with ur writing, and do watch it closely (criticism is always welcome!), since I don’t think that it is a painting. Also, I agree with the Ian Wilson theory. Now, on some more details (if there are interested parties), when it comes to the Eastern rite involving the epitaphios and icons “not made by a human hand”, I recommend the works of one Aleksey Lidov, https://moscowstate.academia.edu/AlexeiLidov\nAnd, recommend the investigation of the further Mandylion type developments when it comes to the frescoepaintings. I am doing that for some time now.

Nice to meet you also. Actually, my first short book on the Shroud is in the process of translation into English, but in this version, I am not getting into details about the “missing years”, except for the indication on the Peloponnese trace, regarding the Serbian icon Saint Face de Laon. I have suggested the Serbian idea way back to Ian, regarding lots of signs from Serbia, but templar “discovery” of B. Frale, stopped our research for a while. Now, we do have diff. views on the road of the Serbian path, for now….\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 5:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"sdjj","post":"Yes, I am always open minded. Thus, aware that the Mandylion/Shroud theory is hard to proof, but I find it most probable. This Serbian example, in possibile connection with the Mother of God holding the Shroud, and with, what might be the allusion to the Shroud displayed within the casket. The Shroud is here much wider.\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 4:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"sdjj","post":"Yes, Matejce church where the Serbian king Milutin was crowned, is now much destroyed. I could not visit, since after the terrorist Albanian organisation so called ANA, drove out all the Serbs living around. Bus going to that area, from Skoplje, goes only once a year, under military escort and is reserved for Serbs that once lived there, to pay their respect for their dead in Matejce grounds (since the Serbian cemetery is destroyed). To tell u the truth I lost lots of nerves while escaping from Kosovo and dodging bullets around Serbian churches (the few that survived)..\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 5:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"sdjj","post":"Also, I am very much interested in the post 1204. faith of Keramion.\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 5:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"sdjj","post":"Thank u Louis! Well, I was planing to get out in three days, but it took me three weeks… I do believe that there is a great chance the “sindon” fresco (as I call it) still stands. I was informed that part of the inside was not so much damaged (they ware practising shooting on some other parts of frescoes mostly…). Yes, there are some Serbian evidences in my first book.

The problem is that historians are still not shore if Helena was Anjoy, or just related. Nevertheless, her monastery in Serbia, Gradac is a jewel of the Shroud (speaking as a pro Wilson xD) depiction, from what is left from the Turkish destruction. Templar connection yes (as in protecting) but I do not think – in possession. I do know Dan Scavone was looking into Thessaloniki few years ago, but did not found anything more. But Serbs ware much present there, as ware in Peloponnese..\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 8:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"sdjj","post":"Thank u daveb of wellington nz! Yes, I am aware and as I said, I am monitoring everything…:)\nWhemn it comes to Mr. Markwardt’s work, I do find it refreshing, but Wilson-ist I stay. I do not think that, since we mentioned Serbian Matejce, at some point frescoes depicting the Abgar legend presented a large (I know, for some not large enough…) cloth – named sindon. Or look at the Studenica example. When it comes to the Slavonic history, one must also have in mind the historical background of this depictions. I believe that same goes for Serbs living in todays parts of Albania, Croatia and Bulgaria; same goes for Slavs in todays Belorussia, Russia.\n\n","date":"March 26, 2015 at 8:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/25/double-0-7s-big-3-analysis/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Double-0-7’s  Big 3 Analysis"},{"author":"sdjj","post":"Yes Louis, and I was actually having in mind idea of Noel Currer-Brigs, when it comes to the Thessaloniki.
