Thank u Charles! I am familiar with ur writing, and do watch it closely (criticism is always welcome!), since I don’t think that it is a painting. Also, I agree with the Ian Wilson theory. Now, on some more details (if there are interested parties), when it comes to the Eastern rite involving the epitaphios and icons “not made by a human hand”, I recommend the works of one Aleksey Lidov, https://moscowstate.academia.edu/Alexei Lidov And, recommend the investigation of the further Mandylion type developments when it comes to the frescoepaintings. I am doing that for some time now. Example from Serbia, 1234.

Since, Alan Adler gave at the Richmond Shroud Conference in 1999. Comment that the surrounding cloth will gradually get darker and darker with time until the image first becomes a silhouette and later finally disappears altogether. Got me thinking and wondering what is the opinion of the participants on this site: was there more blood centuries ago on the Shroud? Look at the http://plastanica.blogspot.com/, and espc.

Nice to meet you also. Actually, my first short book on the Shroud is in the process of translation into English, but in this version, I am not getting into details about the “missing years”, except for the indication on the Peloponnese trace, regarding the Serbian icon Saint Face de Laon. I have suggested the Serbian idea way back to Ian, regarding lots of signs from Serbia, but templar “discovery” of B. Frale, stopped our research for a while. Now, we do have diff.

I could not visit, since after the terrorist Albanian organisation so called ANA, drove out all the Serbs living around. Bus going to that area, from Skoplje, goes only once a year, under military escort and is reserved for Serbs that once lived there, to pay their respect for their dead in Matejce grounds (since the Serbian cemetery is destroyed).

Yes, I am aware and as I said, I am monitoring everything…:) Whemn it comes to Mr. Markwardt’s work, I do find it refreshing, but Wilson ist I stay. I do not think that, since we mentioned Serbian Matejce, at some point frescoes depicting the Abgar legend presented a large (I know, for some not large enough…) cloth – named sindon. Or look at the Studenica example. When it comes to the Slavonic history, one must also have in mind the historical background of this depictions.

Well, I was planing to get out in three days, but it took me three weeks… I do believe that there is a great chance the “sindon” fresco (as I call it) still stands.

The problem is that historians are still not shore if Helena was Anjoy, or just related. Nevertheless, her monastery in Serbia, Gradac is a jewel of the Shroud (speaking as a pro Wilson x D) depiction, from what is left from the Turkish destruction. Templar connection yes (as in protecting) but I do not think – in possession. I do know Dan Scavone was looking into Thessaloniki few years ago, but did not found anything more.
