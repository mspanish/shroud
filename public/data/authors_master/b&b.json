However they measured the weight to be 52,8 mg. The larger sample was cut into three pieces, weighing 12,39 mg, 14,72 mg and 11,83 mg. Only the last two were used for radiocarbon dating. The piece weighing 12,39 mg was retained and appears to have been the sample used by Prof. Jull for the examination reported in his paper in Radiocarbon. What happened to the separate smaller piece is not made clear, although Prof. Jull stated that it was not used for measurements.”\n\n","date":"January 21, 2011 at 11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/21/mark-oxleys-paper-is-a-must-read/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Oxley’s Paper is a Must Read"},{"author":"b&b","post":"How true, domenico.\n\n","date":"January 1, 2011 at 10:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/01/the-danger-in-abstracts-of-scientific-papers/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Danger in Abstracts of Scientific Papers"}],"history":[{"author":"b&b","post":"Thank you for posting this wonderful letter.
