{"misc":[{"id":"comment-216801","author":"joanna","post":"Thank you for all your years of Shroud Story blogging, Dan. It was and always will be an excellent site and I agree with virtually all you write – except one little thing I noticed in your posts, and which I hesitated to talk about in this comment (hope you don’t mind) but here goes, for whatever it’s worth. I first heard of the Shroud almost 40 yrs ago but didn’t start to read as much as I could about it until 1999 or so (and I went to the Dallas symposium). Around the same time, I also began to study – and I know this sounds to some that I wear a tin foil hat – crop circles. I tried to keep these two interests of mine separate, but the more I researched crop circles, the more I could not dismiss them all as man made, in the same way I cannot dismiss the Shroud as the possible burial cloth of Christ. I have been in crop circles in the UK and here in Canada; I could go on about how many Canadian formations were inadvertently discovered by crop dusting pilots and/or farmers in vast prairie fields (with no tramlines and therefore no entrance pathways) or how I’ve personally visited ones in Ontario that were only reported to me the night before, never received media attention and where I found no evidence of ‘planking or pranking’. Rather than get into a debate I’ll refer any interested reader to the Burke, Levengood, Talbott website (bltresearch.com) for more detailed information and there are many other resources, like temporarytemples.co.uk or cropcircleconnector.com too. When I visited Turin, to personally view the Shroud in 2010. I’m Catholic and did all the usual prayers but I also asked, ‘does this have something to do with crop circles’ and ‘why hasn’t there been a Shroud crop circle?’. And then there was one. It may very well be man made but when you’ve studied them as much as I have, you realize there’s the possibility – a very strong one actually – that it isn’t. It’s mind boggling and something I don’t think one should close his or her mind to (in much the same way many do about the Shroud). Two physical, tangible enigmas that are often ignored or discredited in the media. Thanks again for your blog and Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!.","date":"2015-12-18","mins":"12:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"}]}
