{"opinion":[{"author":"steven_j_denuccio","post":"people will go on living as they do up to the end, if there is one. The Shroud is an enigma like no other. Real or not. It’s incredible and should get all the attention and study possible. Like the chamber under the right paw of the Sphynx, and other anamolies…they need to open these areas for inspection. Now, before it’s too late. There are things out there that go unchecked that could put some real light on alot of these end of time ideas. I think there is so much out there, and so much undiscovered. We’ve only scratched the surface. Whatever happens, we’ll never be able to change a thing no matter what we know. But, at least we can go out knowing how much we screwed up, and accept our fate.\n\n","date":"December 21, 2011 at 10:16 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/08/21/the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-end-of-the-world/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"The Shroud of Turin and The End Of The World"}]}
