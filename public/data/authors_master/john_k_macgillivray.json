Sean Murphy needs a quiet place where his mind can be truly still and whereby he can reflect on those particular truths that can truly set him free,One should never go into a battle without knowing the enemy…we must give the adversary his dues because he can, has and will continue to deceived many.Although I hate to admit it,I do respect the ability of my foe to be able to mislead and deceive as masterfully as he does.And as a result I find myself much less gullible and able to defend myself and my faith when in battle,My uncle who was born Canadian,had moved to the U.S. and joined the U.S. army (Sgt. Charles A.MacGillivray)when the second world war broke out.He knew what it was like to be engaged in fierce battle with the enemy in the truest sense of the word.He was highly decorated for his actions (congressional medal of honor and the purple heart ). But deserved as he was of this honor,I also believe that God has reserved His M.O.H.’s in which He will highly decorate His soldiers as well.The times we live in are probably the most challenging than at any other time in history and I believe that God has raised up an army of His own, to combat those forces which are so relentless in their efforts to deceive mankind.And I believe also that those who have totally and truly committed themselves to this “spiritual warfare” will one day also receive a crown of victory or medal of honor…one which is in store and will be personally received from God Himself.","date":"July 31, 2012 at 9:57 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/07/31/huh-what-would-happen-if-the-clone-of-the-son-of-god-became-an-atheist-himself/","cat":"books","title":"Huh? “What would happen if the clone of the son of God became an atheist himself”"}]}
