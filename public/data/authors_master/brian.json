How do you make explain the correlation and preciseness of Jesus’s wounds described in the bible to the image on the shroud.  Does it not make more sence to assume the man on the shroud depicts the execution of  Jesus vs. one of the night of the templar leaders.  It seems to me that it takes a greater leap of faith to believe that the man on the shroud is a templar night, not Jesus.\n\n","date":"June 20, 2013 at 6:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/20/colin-berry-a-hunch-just-that-that-rogers-may-have-been-used/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry:  a hunch – just that – that Rogers may have been used"},{"author":"brian","post":"If you assume the blood was added later, you still have to explain the rest of the wounds and scourge marks.\n\n","date":"June 20, 2013 at 9:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/20/colin-berry-a-hunch-just-that-that-rogers-may-have-been-used/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Colin Berry:  a hunch – just that – that Rogers may have been used"},{"author":"brian","post":"….absolutely!

If I think something is a fraud, I give it just enough time until I have enough information to prove to myself it is a fraud and then drop it.  Yet it seems to be that there are skepics spending so much time and effort disapproving the shroud.  They mush not have anything better to do.\n\n","date":"July 2, 2013 at 7:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/01/jref-catholics-answers-and-the-like/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"JREF, Catholics Answers and the like"}]}
