Final note: the simple fact that there are halos of serum around almost every scourge wounds on the Shroud is enough to understand that Zugibe’s hypothesis is incorrect because if he was right, the oozing of post mortem blood that would have occcurred after the vigorous washing of the corpse would never have produced these sort of halos of serum that are easy to detect under UV fluorescence light. WHY? what does washing of the body has to do with the postmortem sipping of the bodily fluids from the wounds? Bodily fluids IS plasma practically speaking ( I mean interstitial fluid, mucous, sweat, tears, pleaural fluid, abdominal transsudate and so on) with specific additions and variations depending on the fluid. But they all can produce halos and fluorescence.

If the pt is alcalotic ( blood p H is higher than normal) than it is usually accompanied by hypokalemia as there is an exchanhe of H and K ions. However I am not sure the same process can be attributed to blood stains – in alive person hypokalemia is RELATIVE – the K concentration is lower in plasma as K is pushed into the cells, but if one lyses the cells the total amount of K is going to be balanced – because it will come back from the cells into the plasma ( together with all other ingredients of the cell). In a bloodstain yoiu have both cells and plasma components, so amount of potassium is unchanged( because it is a summary of plasma potassium and cell potassium). Please explain why do you make this conclusion – hypokalemia in the stain proves the alcalotic washout of the cloth.

Yannick, the nature of most of those wounds is such that they are not oozing whole blood in the alive state, and we are talking about post mortem. The scourge marks would not ooze whole blood, the side wound won’t ooze whole blood, the whole blood might have been oozing form the thorns wounds and crucifixion wounds – but others won’t.

I already asked this question – when you are talking about the description of ht stains by Barbet/Adler and telling that those contradict what Zugibe is writing – are you talking about the same stains? or you think that Zugibe is wrong in his assumption of the body being washed, because then there won’t be any retracted clots left? But there could be – the body could have been washed not in a way you expect – to wash away all the clots, but it could have been just moistening them, not washing away. On the issue of washing/not washing I think one would benefit more listening not to “blood experts” but those who know the ancient Jewish burial customs and with taking into account that it was Friday evening. The approach to all the possibilities should be complex – and we might want to listen what Max tells us on this – because his approach might have the valuable touch to all the discussion.

Zugibe thought that they were caused by an oozing of liquid post mortem blood after the removal of the dried clots by a vigorous washing while Barbet (and also Adler) conclude that these stains were made of exudates of blood clots that were still humid enough (Adler) or that became re moistened thanks to the release of water vapor by the corpse (Barbet), so they could leave the kind of precise mirror imprints of themselves on the cloth.

The main argument against that is the fact that there is absolutely no smudge of blood that would have been caused by an oozing of post mortem blood in liquid form, particularly in the region of the back, which would certainly have happened if only a few clots would have been removed thanks to the washing (which, in my mind, would have certainly happened in a few places, even if the washing would have been done very mildly). Also, the simple fact that dirt have been found in the region of the heels and knees is another strong argument agains the idea of a washing (whether it be a gentle or a vigorous washing). Effectively, I don’t see the Jews of Jesus time (who were very meticulous normally) leaving evident traces of dirt on very exposed body parts like the knees… Finally, if the Shroud is the genuine shroud of Jesus, the idea of a washing has to be seen in contradiction with the Gospel accounts of an hasty and incomplete burial because of the arrival of the Sabbath and Passover feast. Along with these strong arguments, I’m sure that if I think about it for some time, I will come up with some more arguments… But the 3 I just bring you are solid enough to understand that a gentle washing of the body is unlikely… I GIVE UP : ) you do not understand what I am asking and keep repeating the same nonsense – I have never ever even talked about the WHOLE BLOOD oozing or not.

Can you ask it again in more clear terms please? I thought you were pretending that there was no différences between an halo of serum caused by the clot retraction process of blood clotting and an halo of serum caused by an oozing of post mortem bleeding. In the case of the Shroud, Adler and Barbet were precise about the fact that the halo of serum (which were first described by Barbet and later confirmed by Miller and Pellicori as also by Adler) were caused by the phenomenon known as clot retraction when the clot is in his drying phase on the skin. I have a hard time to believe an oozing of post mortem blood that would be surrounded by some serum would cause the same kind of bloodstains we see on the Shroud that are surrounded by very nice serum halos. If we believe Barbet and Adler’s conclusions, this kind of serum halo cannot come from anything else than exudates of humid blood clots. And for Barbet, even the big blood flow under the side wound was caused by exudates of a very recent blood clot that was still very humid (because it never got time to dry completely before the body was placed inside the Shroud).

The washing (by the way I already said that the term “vigorous” was from me to avoid people could think of a simple rising without any wash) proposed by him would REMOVE THE DRY CLOT COMPLETELY and produce an oozing of LIQUID BLOOD. How can you get an oozing of something else than liquid blood if you remove the dry clot of the wound? It’s evident you will get an oozing of LIQUID BLOOD. And Barbet was categorical about that: Except in the region of the feet, there is no bloodstains on the Shroud that were made by a transfer of liquid blood. It’s not me who talk, it is Barbet.

First of all, most of the blood within the scourge wounds of the victim would have been clotted and the blood located both at the periphery and outside of the wounds would have dried long before the victim was placed on the cross. According to the experiments of Lavoie et al., a cloth would have to be placed on a moist clot no later than 2 ½ hours after bleeding stopped ( 5 ). In addition, these authors indicate that moistened clots have to be transferred within an hour for a good mirror image transfer to take place. Forgetting all of the other wounds, no one would argue that the scourge wounds were made and clotting begun several hours prior to death. Moreover, most forensic experts agree that the Man of the Shroud shows evidence of rigor mortis because of the bent knees and absence of a neck, therefore indicating that the crucified was dead for some time before being taken down from the cross. Thus, according to the studies of Lavoie’s group, these perfectly defined wounds should not have transferred at all. Yet many of the scourge wounds on the Shroud of Turin are extremely distinct corresponding to dumbbell shaped wounds. Even if the clots from these wounds satisfied the time and moisture criteria postulated by Lavoie’s group, the shape of the scourge wounds including the bloody areas around the wounds would be indistinct and extremely variable in size and shape depending on the depth of the wound, the angle of the wound, the amount of blood flow, the flow pattern and whether or not clothing was adherent to the wounds.

However, if the body was washed, the dried blood around the wounds would be removed causing an oozing of bloody material within the wounds resulting in the production of relatively good impressions of the wound. In order to test this hypothesis, pieces of linen and paper towels were gently touched (not pressed) against wounds from accident victims who lived for several hours following the accident. Relatively no impressions were made. This was repeated after the wounds were rinsed with water and allowed to soak on the wounds for several minutes. Only indistinct bloody impressions were made. The wounds were then washed and this procedure tried again.

But this is NOT a nose bleeding, so you can not try to prove that a person can bleed a half a liter from his nose ( as from nose trauma) by variceal bleeding which has a nose as an outlet, not a sourse for the blood. Variceal bleeding can be massive, because it is from the vessel structure and under pressure, plus there is a hypocoagulable state because of the liver insufficiency.

Here is an excerpt of “Pericardial Effusion” the link below: He did not have pleurisy. He had pulmonary edema. Pericardial effusion has nothing to do with it. “Those who were flogged would often go into hypovolemic shock, a term that refers to low blood volume. In other words, the person would have lost so much blood he would go into shock. The results of this would be 1) The heart would race to pump blood that was not there. 2) The victim would collapse or faint due to low blood pressure. 3) The kidneys would shut down to preserve body fluids. 4) The person would experience extreme thirst as the body desired to replenish lost fluids. He did not loose much blood. He was in shock – but not because of the blood loss but becasue of pain, severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysis your results as 1,2,3, can cause a smile, because those are just bites of what is going on in a human body in the shock conditions. They are not incorrect, they are simply just some of. And one might be tachycardica and hypertensive prior to becoming bradycardic ad hypotensive – or another combination of parameters – depending on a time frame. Since Jesus did not loose blood massively adn severe dehydration does not egual severe hemorrhage, the last terminal stage of shock ( hypotension,bradycardia and death) would not develop in a 12 hour time frame. There is evidence from Scripture that Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock as a result of being flogged. No there is no such evidence becasue He did not have hypovolemic shock hwile carrying the croos to Gogotha – he was in a pain shock and was developing severe dehydration, but this was still not hypovolemic shock. He fell down not because of the hypotension ( if that would be the case, He would not get up) but because of lot of trauma after scourging and the heaviness of the cross – that was too much. Another indicator that Jesus suffered from hypovolemic shock was that He declared He was thirsty as He hung on the cross (John 19:28), indicating His body’s desire to replenish fluids. Which not a proof of hypovolemic SHOCK just a proof of hypovolemia as a result of dehydration. One does not have to be in shock and still be hypovolemic. As I stated above – if His fall would be from hypotension as a late stage of shock ( which is usually seen quickly only upon severe hemorrhage, not dehydration – that is more prolonged) He would not be able to get up and would have died there – o the road. Prior to death, the sustained rapid heartbeat caused by hypovolemic shock also causes fluid to gather in the sack around the heart and around the lungs. I can guarantee you He was having tachycardia from the agony in Gethsemane. And rapid heartbeat does not cause fluid to gather in the pericardium or around the lungs. Not even in a week time frame, and we are talking here hours – that is not enough time for pleural effusion or pericardial effusion to accumulate. This gathering of fluid in the membrane around the heart is called pericardial effusion, and the fluid gathering around the lungs is called pleural effusion. This explains why, after Jesus died and a Roman soldier thrust a spear through Jesus’ side (probably His right side, piercing both the lungs and the heart), blood and water came from His side just as John recorded in his Gospel (John 19:34). No it does not explain it – because there is no way enough fluid will accumulate in the pericardium or pleural space in less than 12 hours we have, unless the fluid is blood as a result of mechanical trauma ( which is not the case) Interstitial fluid from the lungs is a result of pulmonary edema which was one of the causes of death and which developed already after crucifixion – and pulmonary edema is a result of acute heart failure with literally flooding of the lungs with interstitial fluid The explanations for the blood and water flow are closely related at several points. All physicians who have examined the question agree that Jesus was already dead when the chest wound was inflicted. The blood and water most probably flowed from both the heart and the chest cavity. That is true, but blood is ALWAYS in the heart, which when pierced will give the flow of the blood and it is also always in the lungs – lungs are filled with blood, because they are the filter for it, so to say, so piercing of the lungs will cause blood flow as well – no need to additional accumulation of blood anywhere. Fluid is a result of the pulmonary edema, which was a process preceding death and basically the cause of such a rapid death.","date":"2013-06-14","mins":"9:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse"},{"id":"comment-37033","author":"jesterof","post":"Angel, look at Down’s, because you clearly are oblivious that it is one of the most remarkable visible abnormalities : http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=&imgrefurl=http://www.dsrf.org/blog/dsrf blog/speech and language therapy for adults with down syndrome&h=0&w=0&sz=1&tbnid=fqo BC0dztsi PGM&tbnh=183&tbnw=275&prev=/search%3 Fq%3 Ddown%2 Bsyndrome%2 Bteen%26tbm%3 Disch%26tbo%3 Du&zoom=1&q=down+syndrome+teen&docid=QV Tt UIK0uw G Us M&hl=en here are the explanations for the distinct facial features ( none of which have anything to do with the features of the Man of the Shroud): http://sathiyam.tv/english/featured/march 21 world down syndrome.","date":"2013-06-14","mins":"9:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse"},{"id":"comment-37035","author":"jesterof","post":"Angel : jesterof, I don’t care if Abe Lincoln has Kleinfelter/Kleinfelter’s or Down Syndrome.

Lincoln could not have had Marfan’s syndrome because his hands were not long and thin and he couldn’t have had Kleinfelter’s, because he didn’t have enlarged breasts. Now, Jesus was tall. Jesus’ arms and legs were longer than normal and His hands were long and thin. As well,Jesus had a long, narrow face, like Senator John Kerry and He had breasts, as is clearly seen on the Shroud frontal image.

Below is an excerpt from Doug Leatherman, MD, on Jesus’ massive blood loss: “There is much disagreement among the authorities as to the scourging. This was a Roman, not a Jewish, custom. The hands were tied high to a tree or post. A whip was made of a short wood handle and heavy leather straps bearing usually the sharp bones of sheep knuckles or lead balls on the ends. The Jews forbade more than forty lashes (thirty nine was the maximum allowed), but the Romans did not have this limit. The scourging was usually carried out by a Roman soldier. The whip was brought down upon the bare back, cutting the skin first; then as the beating progressed, the muscles were laid bare, bruised and bleeding with marked loss of blood. In a significant number of instances this was enough to kill a man. Ribs were broken, nerves exposed. Again and again, down came the whip until either death or unconsciousness occurred. Both venous and arterial bleeding occurred. Large deep, dark, bruised surfaces began to appear. Finally the skin of the back is hanging in long shreds. The whole area is an unrecognizable mass of torn, bleeding tissue.” http://www.churches of christ.net/tracts/job004u.htm Here is an image of the flagrum that was used on Jesus’ scourging. Note the metal balls attached to the leather whip. Http://www.indyprops.com/pp flagrum.htm Therefore, a massive blood loss from 60 lashes would be an understatement. As well, Jesus’ scourging was thoroughly detailed in Mel Gibson’s movie, “The Passion of the Christ.” Best, one won’t loose blood massivel from the scourging. At most it would be half a liter – which I am being VERY generous about. Scourging is very painful and stressful, but it is superficial trauma with no major blood vessels involved, whith coagualtion cascade activated immediately after the first scourge, \\ the picture described does not match the markings on the Shroud – if the skin would be torn off in big stripes as Dr leatheman describes, there should be the appropriate markings on the Shroud – we instead do have almost the same type of bell shaped wounds which are not compatible with above described picture. But even if the picture would be as described, there won’t be “massive blood loss” becasue that trauma is superficial and as I’ve already said the defense mechanisms of the body would already been activated. Clearly, the person theorizing about “massive blood loss” after superficial dermal injury has never been in the operating room.

I disagree – one must include PERTINENT possibilities, chronic nitrate exposure is such a stretch possibility that it is not worth consideration, especially since thee is not even one piece of proof for that, but there are tons of possibilities of other nature – drying and postmortem fumigation/mordanting. Angel : Remember, as well, all things were not recorded in the Gospels. Certainly the Gospels did not mention Jesus had a sex chromosome trisomy (XXY), nor did the Gospels mention, in regard to maternal DNA (mt DNA), Jesus had a mutant genetic marker at 150 T. What specific genetic disease is associated with that marker? As far as I remember the bits and peices of DNA were so fragmented that there was no possibility to draw ANT conclusions fro that. XXY is Kleinfelter syndrome. While there is always a possibility in someone who never had children of their own that such a male has Kleinfelter’s ( unless they are unusually short), there is no reason except the fantasy of a filmmaker to think Jesus Christ had that particular syndrome. Taking into consideration that by Gospels He did not have the source where the Y will come from, it is highly unlikely He was genotypically XXY or even XY If one remebers the birth history of Jesus, one must conclude that His genotype will be that of XX even without a SRY gene – this has been described: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16556678 Angel : While it is probable Methemaglobin was the result of trauma and stress, we are not certain Jesus was deficient in producing the diaphorase enzyme, nor if Jesus had an abnormal hemoglobin variant (Hemoglobin M). Methhemoglobinemia would be the result of either of those mentioned abnormalities. No, it is NOT probable that Jesus methemoglobinemia in dried blood resulted from stress and trauma – those DO NOT produce hemoglobinemia. Any speculations on a possibility of any genetic mutation causing methemoglobinemia is a pure fantasy without any background to back it up, so it is not worth to discuss it. Angel : Since, Leoncio A. Garza Valdes was only able to obtain fragmented DNA, there are many things NOT listed in the Gospels that may, in fact, define Jesus.

Excerpt: “Exsanguination is a relatively uncommon and dramatic cause of death in humans. Blunt force trauma to the liver, kidneys, and spleen can cause severe internal bleeding as well, though the abdominal cavity usually becomes visibly darkened as if bruised. Similarly, trauma to the lungs can cause bleeding out, though without medical attention blood can fill the lungs causing drowning, or in the pleura causing suffocation, well before exsanguination would occur. In addition, serious trauma can cause tearing of major blood vessels without external trauma indicative of the damage.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exsanguination Internal bleeding was evident when Jesus was pierced with the sword (blood and water poured out). Excerpt: “A number of forensic pathologists have examined the descriptions (and, in some cases, information on the Shroud of Turin). They all agree that there is no way water could have come out. But, they agree that the heart is surrounded by the pericardium, which contains a watery fluid and a lance thrust would have extracted this fluid, which would look like water. The thrust would also have pierced the heart, drawing accumulated blood. Even if Jesus didn’t die of asphyxiation and even if He didn’t die of congestive heart failure and even if He didn’t die of hypovolemic shock and even if He didn’t die from the internal hemorrhaging itself, He had a large, deep, open chest wound through at least one lung and probably the heart, with internal bleeding. This would have caused internal infection and in a few days He would have died of sepsis, i.e., infection.” Best, I f you connect the BLOOD FROM PIERCED HEART and the interstitial fluid from the pleural pace and the lungs of somebody who died because of the pulmonary edema – and try to pin it as a “proof” of internal bleeding the conclusion is 1) you do not understand neither basic anatomy and physiology 2) you do not know what “internal bleeding” entails 3) there is clear no point FOR ME to proceed in this discussion – the blog format is impossible for quick lectures in anatomy/physiology/basic pathology.

While the general public understands that internal bleeding means bleeding that can’t be seen on the outside of the body, medical personnel tend to use terms that describe precisely where inside the body the bleeding is found. The internal bleeding may occur within tissues, organs, or in cavities of the body including the head, chest, and abdomen. Examples of other potential sites of bleeding include the eye, lining tissues of the heart, muscles, and joints.

And if you consider a liter of blood to be HALF of a grown man blood supply ( it is called adult blood volume) you need to first check the figures, because it is about 20% of adult man blood volume, often even less.

Half a man’s blood supply would be approximately 3 liters. I found your inital post and you did state not more than half a liter, but I am of the opinion Jesus lost more than 500 m L, and that is because of the blood loss from the head, nose and mouth as evidenced by the comparative study of the Sudarium of Oviedo and the Shroud of Turin. Angel, did you ever see anybody in real life loose a liter of blood? Exactly 1000 ml? I suspect that you did not, therefore this amount, or 500 ml or 2 liters are somewhat theoretical for you and you easily throw the figures and the causes, because you have never experienced it in reality. One can not loose even 500 ml from a nose bleeding and mouth bleeding, unless somebody has a very severe case of hemophilia. This is impossible simply because we are designed that way – otherways we would be extinct already. Our defense mechanisms prevent us loosing even 100 ml of blood because of the nose bleed. Or mouth bleed. A blood loss of a liter( without replacement) in a most case scenarios leads to severe morbidity and sometimes mortality, depending on a situation In Jesus case if he would loose a litr of blood upon scourging or have had an internal bleeding of that amount as a result of some blunt trauma ( it does have to be severe) he won’t survive the road to Calvary. Real internal bleeding the ones you have heard about, and connect to here are acute life threatening conditions and lead to the OR STAT, or otherwise they end up in a morgue. Angel : The Sudarium was in direct contact with Jesus’ head and it was noted by the Sudarium scientists how much blood Jesus had lost from the head, mouth and nose. Since the Sudarium sopped up most of the blood, what blood is displayed on the Shroud is not indicative of Jesus’ total blood loss. My statement was Jesus lost approximately half his blood supply. A man’s total blood supply is anywhere from 5 to 6 liters; therefore, 2.5 to 3 liters is what I predicted. Best, The Sudariuum does not prove in any way your hypothesis of massive blood loos. Bleeding – yeas, but not massive blood loss. Sudarium proves a blood loss of about 50 ml If Jesus would loose half of his blood supply He would die at the place of scourging.

I have provided the link to medical review of pathogenesis of the DIC syndrome, and why the blood is simply sipping out without any coagulation is explained there. In brief – DIC at the stage of absence of coagulation factors because of their consumption at the initial stage resembles totally antigoagulated state. There are no factors in palsma and severe thrombocytopenia as well. The new factors are simply not yet synthetized by the body and if DIC is not treated the pt can simply die because f the hemorrhage – from every orifice of the body. The similar picture is observed with acute liver failure – liver is a synthetyc factory of the body and thee coagulation factors are synthetized there – if depleted and not repleted – hemorrhage occurs. “From the #9, follow up comment, I take it to mean that you are saying that, of course there would be elevated levels of hydroxyproline in the serum of someone that had undergone the events described in the gospel narratives, i.e. Jesus?

Also, if the sample were from a bloodstain of a non tortured individual, would the baseline levels of hydroxyproline in the blood be sufficient to detect by such methods?” Yes, the hydroxiproline levels could be extensively elevated in a severely tortured individual. I do not understand what are you asking in the second portion of the question – elevated hydroxiproline levels in a non tortured individual are possible – in some medical conditions. The problems with interpretation of medical results by non medically trained public is that they tend to make them absolute.

I can understand, it becomes elevated under certain conditions, but I was referring to a normal baseline hope that is more clear. Of course. There are plenty of hydroxyproline assay kits available on a market – both for serum and urine measurement. Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase following protein synthesis (as a post translational modification). Hydroxyproline is a major component of the protein collagen. Proline hydroxylation requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The most obvious, first effects (gingival and hair problems) of absence of ascorbic acid in humans come from the resulting defect in hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen, with reduced stability of the collagen molecule, causing scurvy.

As for your attempting to dismiss the Shroud blood colour anomaly, I can only repeat what I said earlier: no one on this site had any trouble with Adler pointing it out, not while there was an authenticity promoting narrative to account for it – that fanciful bilirubin story. It’s only when I come along, first pointing out (a year ago) that bilirubin could never have survived intact for centuries in Shroud bloodstains, and then, just a couple of days ago reported here a quotation from 1999 in which Adler himself had acknowledged as much, that all of a sudden there is no red anomaly, that it is all just a figment of our imaginations. If there were no spectral signature for that red anomaly, then how could Adler have claimed to have modelled it with combinations of methaemoglobin and bilirubin? Are you aware that it is not me you are contradicting, so much as Alan D.Adler? Speaking for myself, I have no objection to your doing that – but do make an effort to maintain a modicum of scientific and logical consistency. It does not matter WHOM I am contradicting, because as I have stated at the very beginning – the whole concept of too bright, too fresh or too red – is flawed, IMHO, as it is based on the subjective evaluation. If Adler picked up the battle – it is not my concern, but his own evaluations have shown the wavelengths of the samples way below the 600 nm of the live blood I was initially referring to. The wavelength absorption of the whole blood depends on it’s p H, the hemoglobin concentration and some other conditions, which are applicable to dried blood as well. Why did he picked up the battle with bilirubin ( which is not a stable compound, does not interfere with live blood spectrophotometry, at least the one used for pulse oximetry evaluation) I do not know.

The photographs I have seen of the Shroud and the stains do not look out of ordinary, at least not for somebody who works in the operating room and in the ICU and sees blood stains all the time – of all possible hues of red. Some of the blood , even dried is never black as in one of your quotes is suggested. Some dry on tissues and remain red, bright red. If there is addition of mucous material to the blood, it will never darken even to brown. In medical school I have also had a year of forensic pathology course ( I was very interested in that area at some point, but ended up treating alive people, not analyzing their remains) and from that course and later from experience and extensive exposure to all types of body fluids I can attest that blood stains are very different in their colors, blood stains are not always made by the whole blood as one imagines when they have the blood drawn for the blood samples. Diluted or hemolyzed blood, will stain in one color, severe bilubinemia might add additional hue, methemoglobinemia as carboxyhemoglobinemia are definetely different and so on. But the most important is the material stained, since the medium of the material might act as a stabilizer, fixator or reducer of a kind – chemical reactions of blood contents and contents of the stained material can also make the color different or more persistent. Since the Shroud has been under severe fire at least twice – the amount of CO potentially reacting with the stains or any other chemicals in fumes potentially can reduce already oxidized material of the heme and change the color. We can not compare the color from before the fire and after the first fire, but it is certainly possible with the 1997 fire. This is just my speculation from the top of my head. To put it simply – I find differences in colors of blood stains not to be of any particular interest, since variations are very wide and that could even be seen on the photos I’ve provided in my links..","date":"2013-04-04","mins":"8:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"id":"comment-29419","author":"jesterof","post":"You are very welcome, Kelly here are some more pictures to show what I mean by the staining material and differences in color :http://shs.westport.k12.ct.us/forensics/08 blood/bloodstains.htm those flashcards are almost perfect in describing how and why color may differ: http://www.slideshare.net/rolfok/ageing bloodstains there are plenty of links on google if one types” color of blood stains in forensic analysis” or similar word combinations..","date":"2013-04-04","mins":"9:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"id":"comment-29420","author":"jesterof","post":"Although not mentioned by Bollone, CO binding to the free heme group (separated from the hemoglobin polypeptide) has an affinity 20,000x greater than oxygen it is unknown by me (or several whom I have contacted) if this is superglued in or given in would exchange as well.

There is nothing to discuss – for me those photos look like blood stains, for him they look suspicious. Both are totally EQUAL subjective OPINIONS.

This ONE man being Mc Crone? and is it really just one man? Did the idea really originate form Mc Crone? Mc Crone never examined the cloth in person; Baima Bollone preceded him, has examined the cloth in person and also noted the carmine color. Dr. Curto, Turin Museum of Egyptology I am not exactly sure of the timeline, but believed this may have been around the time of the 1976 Commission Report said “Darker, brownish marks on the body represent the trickle of blood or serum issuing from the wounds; we can also pick out two traces of crimson, simulating trickles of blood which, however, would have turned brown when dry [if they had been blood]. Therefore these marks must certainly have been added later and deliberately” this is from Mc Crone’s book, p. 15 So IT is Mc Crone. The one man. With personal vendetta against other members of his initial group. The color does not mean anything at all. First of all it is not carmine – there is all plethora of colors, if one will refer to the link posted here by colinberry.

We all know that if we cut a finger and tie a handkerchief around it, the initial vivid red of the fresh blood will rapidly change to a dull brown, usually within a few hours. Yet at long ago as the early sixteenth century one Antoine de Lalaing deescribed the Shroud bloodstains as ‘clear as if they had been made today’. Vignon, viewing the Shroud the 1930s, described the colour as mauve carmine”. This is laughable. Those are real serious arguments of the people who are supposedly specialists on blood stains? or are they just simply lay people as are abundant here on the blog who have seen only blood brom the finger cut? This man did not have his finger cut. He has been first subjected to beating and ripping of his skin – which by results does not even resemble finger cut, his wounds were not clear cut knife single wound, those were blunt, cut, ripped and all combinations possible wounds. Then he was carrying a very heavy object a long way under scorching sun, which leads to dehydration, rhabdomyolysis and DIC. And severe traumatic shock because of the pain as well. Have you ever had a blister on a foot? such a bad blister, that it fills with blood tinged lymph? Guess what, the stain from that blister with the blood would not look like the stain from clear knife cut finger. And the stain from the blood tinged interstitial fluid from the lungs will also look different. Not to mention the stains from the sipping diluted blood from all orifices of the person who is suffering from DIC. And the bloody urine will stain even more differently.

Certainly there are probably many lay people here on the blog who have only seen blood from a finger cut there have also been the reports of those that have been medically trained that have commented on the red color of the blood on the Shroud #33. It is understandable, even by lay people, that “bloody sputum, bloody saliva, bloody gastric contents, [bloody urine], blood stains from the initial cut during the start of the operation and the blood stains afterwards will ALL look differently”, but are all of those types of stains represented on the Shroud, ventral & dorsal? Don’t get me wrong, I value your input and am surely trying your patience, but a couple of the issues I am unsure about are: To me (the untrained), many of the stains on the Shroud appear to have a similar color is this expected, or given the plethora of bloody origins, would more variation be more like it? Second, experience with bloodstains, etc. as some have also pointed out, does this fully apply to aged bloodstains? Maybe you are convinced it does I would like to understand as well. I’ve had lots of blisters on my feet, blood filled yes; bruises, cuts on my face, blood filled (pugilism), cuts on my fingers, yes, I can appreciate the variation. As mentioned above, for me, maybe for others, that’s some of the issue: are the bloodstains on the forehead, back of the head, wrists believed to have been elevated similar color as many others, more anatomically positioned to contain blood from sputum, gastric juices, saliva, interstitial fluid, blood urine, etc. Kelly, you are not trying my patience at all. I gladly can explain what I can, and the variance in bllod stains is one of my daily work ( not as a major, obviously, bot as a constant visible side effect). There is no reason to think that if a blood stain from venous hematoma differs from a blood stain of the blood stinged sputum, those same stains in 100, 25 or 1967 years later will look alike, provided, they all were subject to the SAME conditions. What I am trying to make you see is a picture as a whole, not just blood stains, which an ordinary person usually sees after an accidental cut or bruise ( but even those differ in appearance, healing and marking the environment) I am used to look at the patient as a whole, since it is critical care medicine. An orthopedist might see only broken bones and holes, a cardiologist might just refer to pulmonary edema as a result of the acute left ventricular failure, a wound specialist would probably mourn the skin lacerations and probability of generalized infections, but a critical care specialist will have to look at a patient as a whole – including his skin disruption which resembles burns, multiorgan failure, dehydration, DIC, rhabdomyolysis and severe trauma. In surgical and trauma ICU those combinations happen all the time and as a side effect to treating those patients one can appreciate a variety of esthetics which include not only the wide range of possible deformities, discolorations and exudate of the human body, but also their reflection on the tissues, commonly known as stains. Now the other part, which I have tried to express before – the coloring of the stains NOW, or in the previous century has nothing to do with the initial coloring caused by the bodily fluids or their combinations. First, the cloth could have been prepared – impregnated by specific means; second – the body could have been also coated by specific substances; third – during whatever period of time the cloth with originally colored stains might have been subjected to influence by the fluids, fumes, temperature changes and light influence, which could have changed the initial coloring, as, for example happens when some wants to remove stains from the caret, clothing, furniture – not that the staining was a subject of removal, but as a result of accidental or not accidental influence. Methods of conservation do matter as well – since we do not know what were the conditions for centuries, claiming that the color of the stains are the proof of their artificial origin is childish, to say the least. Since the whole arguments of the “color skeptics” are basically – ” that’s the way I see it” without even trying to look for the whole picture, one starts to think – are all other skeptical arguments of the same amateurish level?.","date":"2013-04-05","mins":"8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"id":"comment-29626","author":"jesterof","post":"Hugh Farey : I sense a tone of frustration in jesterhof, who apparently has considerable experience of a variety of blood spillage on a daily basis, but hasn’t seen the Shroud, as opposed to a number of people (albeit including biologists, doctors and a ‘porphyrin specialist’) who have seen the Shroud, but are not as familiar with bloodstains.

How familiar are you with 100 year old blood (from, say Museums of the First World War?), 200 year old blood (Napoleonic?), 500 year old blood (European wars?). My point is that an expertise of various traumas is only the beginning of an understanding of how medieval blood can be described, with or without any medical knowledge, as “fresh.” I already answered that question – if the appearance of blood stains INITIALLY is different there is no reason to think that in 10, 100. 500 or 1967 years they will start to look the same, no matter what the origin of the stain. If the other conditions are the same. If you stain one cloth with whole blood, the other same loth with bloody stinged lymph and the third – with bloody mucous – and place them in the same container with the same temperature and environmental exposure, they will still look differently in 10, 100 or 100 years, if they look differently initially.

No, halo rings are just a marker of a stain of blood with interstitial fluid – like the one which will form on a cloth from somebody coughing out the pulmonary edema froth. Why do you always ask about applied blood? If one applies whole blood – the stains would be of one color, if one applies the mixture of blood and saliva, for instance – they will be different. The halo markings do not prove or disprove the transfer or application – they only prove that the stain is not the whole blood. Given the state of the body after torture I do not see any reasons to question that the stains are mostly not from the whole blood, so the halo marks will be abundant.

The general consensus of most forensic scientists is that as blood ages, over time, it becomes brownish to black in color.

You do not have to expose the babies to the UV light – bilirubin is cleared from the blood all the time by the very body – it is one of it’s functions. UV light just help to prevent the kernicterus by changing the bilirubin from it toxic form to non toxic ( to the brain) 2.

Maybe that’s why some members of STURP had some preconcieved ideas about a potential problem with the color of the blood… That would explain many things. I really would like to know who started this whole issue. Well, by Louis’s link one can assume it was actually described after the Shroud being outside the Cathedral for Exposition in 1931 in a bright sunlight by many – some of the witnesses were able to see the Shroud later and were even surprised it is not that bright anymore ( the above mentioned Lagrand), but others did not and since most of the people are not medical doctors and often do not pay attention to such details, the legend of being “too red” rolled out into the masses : ) So you are right, some memebers of STURP team might have had the preconcieved ideas about the coloring. However, one has to read the exact words told by STURP members in order to judge, because I suppose they did know it is “too red” only under special conditions – as it was known to researchers before – the folks repeating the idea did not bother to remeber the difference and the words ( probable) ” it is very bright upon sun light exposure” changed just to “it’s too bright” – this is a standard psychological turn, since if most of the people won’t consider “sunlight ( or UV) exposure” to be the most pertinent part of the sentence.

It’s been proposed by some investigators that the blood was affected during the process that created the image. The “upset” by neutrons is referred to an experiment conducted by Italian group of researchers. As I understand they do not used the Shroud samples, they irradiated blood samples with a high level of bilirubin by neitrons. After that they tested one sample in the oven heating and the other one by UV light ( both were irrdiated by neutrons first). The first did not change it color, the other did in 30 minutes to bright red. They conclude that irradiation “upset” the blood and that is why the color changed.

Personally, I would like to find out WHY the blood stains on the saponaria treated cloth in the experiment stained in a bright red color and that stayed that way for 17 years. This question is not answered and one can not explain it just by bilirubin amount, because there is no time for the blood in the sample to metabolize the hemolyzed hemoglobin to it’s metabolites.

I realize that these are different scenarios that are apart from trauma & torture leading to death, but just looking for something to understand as a relative comparison. Also, in terms of laboratory experimentation to create a blood simulacra, are these the levels that are necessary? Adler remarked in one of his spectra descriptions using finger stick blood samples, that the amount of protein (albumin) they added was too high, so this would be in excess of that. Any numbers on bilirubin levels for normal versus elevated versus extreme traumatic death? the normal level of bilirubin depending on the system used is Direct bilirubin: 0.1 mg/ dl to 0.3 mg/ dl (1.7 mmol/ l to 5.1 mmol/ l) Indirect bilirubin: 0.2 mg/ dl to 0.8 mg/ dl (3.4 mmol/ l to 12.0 mmol/ l) Total bilirubin: 0.3 mg/ dl to 1.0 mg/ dl (5.1 mmol/ l to 17.0 mmol/ l) NIH.gov gives the upper limit of total level as 1.9 mg/dl Liver failure can be with both very high and very moderate bilirubin levels, level for one patient might be nit that toxic for the other and yellowness of the skin and mucosa differs as well.

In general just as a remark – it is difficult to predict one’s body response to any one given factor to have a simulacra since as I have stated before – clinical picture and actual picture depends not on one factor of bilirubin, there are much more in the clinical picture we are discussing and all of them might have influence on the results.

If we calculate the concentration of the substance it does not matter what we will refer to – a stain or serum of the alive patient. You may calculate it by using the presented method by the dried sample on a paper ( and it will tell you how much of the substance is per volume unit of blood, or serum, since those are commonly agreed values of reference) or by measuring the whole amount in a sample of blood which will be exactly 100 ml – but the latter is just impractical. I believe it is an area of analytical chemistry which I’ve studied back in medical school, but forgive me, I have forgotten it long time ago : ) ” A thread that received more blood transferred relative to one that received less will appear to have a higher concentration of that protein per surface area, even though the overall levels in the original blood should be equivalent. ” No it would not.

But concerning Al Adler’s hypothesis, I learned from Mr. Kearse that he did some coloration test with different level of bilirubin and the one that came out closer to the color of the Shroud blood was the one with a very high level of bilirubin. I know that this doesn’t prove that the color would still be red 2000 years later, but don’t you think that this bilirubin hypothesis makes plenty of sense in the context of the Shroud on which we see the body image of a crucified victim who had been very badly tortured? In such context, everytime I will expect to see a level of bilirubin in the bloodstains much higher than normal! So, why this hypothesis proposed by Adler would not be the solution for the unusual aspect of the blood color? Sometimes, the most simple answers are the best. And this time, this simple answer of Adler fits perfectly well with the context of the burial cloth of a crucified victim. In my mind, this simple fact give Adler’s hypothesis some crédits. The hypothesis by itself is valid. The problem is – I do not see those pictures as “too red” They are NORMAL. As they are supposed to be – to my eyes and I am used to all kinds of blood stains – from whole blood, from blood stinged bodily fluids and so on. To dried stains also. Obviously, not ages old, but if the stain form different body fluids with addition to blood do stain in different color when they are fresh or just have dried a day ago, I do not see any reason why should not they differ centuries later as well. Then, somewhere I’ve read that “too red” is referred only to ONE stain as a spike of the absorption waveform to 650nm and all others are below 500nm. But below 500nm is totally where they are expected to be!

When they reached the cross some time later, they pulled this cloth off his body. Pulling this cloth off the body would have undoubtedly opened up many of the wounds again. Maybe not all, but many. ” Re opened” wounds tend to take forever to close up again or to stop oozing, in my experience, and is a simple answer to all the blood or exudate of blood found from the scourge wounds. Like David Goulet mentioned above, I like the idea of God sending rain to cleanse the body of Christ, but, it would not explain the absence of dirt on the body by the time they had reached the tomb! If we take the studies on the Sudarium somewhat, and scriptures into account, and maybe a little common sense, Jesus hung on the cross for some time ‘after death’ and before taken down. He was then laid on the ground for a period of time, (possibly in the removal of the nails and/or from the cross). They did not have cobblestone or tiled ground, it was dirty/sandy or possibly muddy ground! He would have been covered in a excessive amount of dirt with no doubt. Enough dirt to cover most, if not all the body. Hence I still believe a ‘PARTIAL’ washing is evident. Washing does not necessarily mean scrubbing/ wiping, washing would have been a delicate procedure of ‘dabbing’ with a wet sponge or other cloth, which would be essential if trying to avoid lifeblood in the procedure. This could account somewhat for the dampness which existed within, once the body was enshrouded, especially since time was of the essence and the body would not have had time to dry.

No I’m not a physician, but I am a biology graduate, so perhaps gave that impression. The point about my nosebleed remark was not that any of the marks were made by a nosebleed, but that if any of the blood was added by a forger for verisimilitude, he would not need any technical knowledge, just a sponge. Jones’s claim, which attempts to refute the possibility of a Medieval artist on the grounds of lack of microscopical or ultra violet knowledge, doesn’t make sense. Regarding your point about the difference between blood from a dead body and a live one, the picture is extremely complex, and the shroud is not clear enough for an apples/oranges distinction to be made. As I mentioned, it is possible that the body was washed clean shortly before being laid on the shroud, and that the scourge marks on the back are the result of wounds reopening, or simply seeping. These might be characterised by a lack of red blood cells and an excess of plasma (as you might find by removing a dressing from an open wound before it heals). On the other hand, a forger with a bowl of blood (maybe from a patient who had recently undergone bloodletting) would find he too would have to use it quickly before it too became more plasma than red cells. My own experiments indicate that blood is not at all an easy medium to paint with… I agree totally that it looks like the body was washed before laid in the shroud. On the point about whole blood vs all other bloody material – those are apples and oranges. Whole blood can come and stain only from ALIVE person. A dead body would not sip whole blood ( even if that looks like one)of the same structure as in a live person. The reason I am repeatedly pointing this is that people who are not used to blood and it’s functions tend to project their own experience with bleeding( usually the whole blood) onto the character of staining on the Shroud.and this is not only apples and oranges but apples and beef : ).","date":"2013-07-15","mins":"9:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"id":"comment-32074","author":"jesterof","post":"Juliet Faith : To Max Patrick Hamon…very interesting comments…have you ever seen a picture of the Cameley Head?

I used to work in the pediatric intensive care unit and we were treating kids a lot of kids with different poisonings. Well, there were some admitted with intoxication by antihelmintal products for the big animals and those were deadly – kids were dying from acute liver failure and nothing could be done ( no liver transplants existed). One of the patients (2 years old) was admitted and he needed the central line placement for fluid resuscitation. This was usually done in a separate room, since anesthesia needed to be provided and the procedure required sterile equipment. After the procedure, when the kid was taken to his bed from the OR table, the plastic blue cover of the OR table had bright discoloration in a form of contours of the child’s body as he was lying there…. He wasn’t dying at the moment, he passed away several days later, but the chemical reactions in his body and perspiration from the skin produced such a reaction on a plastic cover. He was not laying on the bare plastic, there was a thin cotton sheet, but the chemical reaction was so strong that it just went through the cotton.

You said that imprints can be formed on plastic because you saw such things in a hospital, so that is OK. My point is that the Jospice Mattress Imprint is not similar to what you have seen and in fact what has been stressed (in my article) is that which Father Francis O’Leary found difficult to explain and also what the BBC team neglected to take into account. And what is that? How was the the head image imprinted on the mattress by penetrating the pillow. The point is that plastic (brought into the discussion by you) and bilirubin (brought into the discussion by the author of the first article you read, and by two prominent bloggers here), have nothing to do with the imprint formation in this case, so if you want to scream, go ahead, but not at me — at them. There is an easy way to avoid screaming. As you are a newcomer on the scene, read the literature on the topic available on the Internet to be able able to understand what exactly the discussion is about and then come to your conclusions. OK? Louis, I think we are talking in parallel here. The possibility of the imprint on the plastic cover of the mattress might be connected to any of the compounds in the body, which the body can perspirate. Making it through the pillow does not seem anything special for me as I have seen the similar type of reaction and it is not impossible, neither has it to be connected to any supernatural phenomena. Singling out bilirubin is only because the same compound was previously singled out in connection with th Shroud( IMHO). Bilirubin is neither stable, nor is it very reactive with other media, so making it the main compound is not the best way to explain the imprints. But the body is producing not only bilirubin and in a failing state there are many more aggressive compounds found in the plasma as well. Maybe it was bilirubin, maybe it was not, but the possibility of chemical reaction and leaving traces on covers is not supernatural even if it is penetrating through the pillow or tightly rolled up towel and sheets. Oh, and one more thing – being here a long time does not make a blogger infallible in their opinion.

On the issue of the image making it through the pillow – it is not the image which makes it through the pillow, but vapors. If you never have experienced anything pungent like formalin or ammonia, it will be difficult to explain that vaporized substances can penetrate a lot of covers. I mentioned those two because they are pungent and one can smell them even with a lot of covers over one’s face, but others can penetrate through different layers as well.

Incidentally, a snapshot from my archive of some fresh blood I had dabbed onto linen did not go yellow under added contrast, so if it’s an artefact, it’s not a simple straightforward one to do with the behaviour of red pigment under added contrast. Shroud blood seems to be atypical – yet again. The extra corporeal bloodstain shows a hint of the effect too, yet to be posted, but perhaps not as clearcut as one would have liked. But that was a Shroud Scope image. If the App fails to show the effect at all, as you report, then it may not be the unmasking effect that I had rather hoped for. Such is life – and sciencebizz… You win some, you lose far more… the stain on your experimental cloth is clearly unwashed whole blood stain, and looks like one, where the Shroud stain does not appear to be a whole blood stain at all. You are comparing apples and oranges.","date":"2013-04-13","mins":"6:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-30796","author":"jesterof","post":"Colinsberry : Leaving aside matters of credibility, those three are all possibilities that can be listed on one’s initial checklist, and then addressed systematically as one works one’s way through all the bloodstains on the Shroud. I did a series of some dozen or so postings last year, based on Shroud Scope, doing just that, so feel entitled to “speculate”, on the grounds that if it is to be written off here by the knocking brigade as mere speculation, then it is at least informed speculation. Example – here’s a link to one of those many postings that noted evidence for flaking off, but with partial retention (“hang up”) – an entirely different signature from your “washing out” or never having been there in the first place. Http://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/lets take a closer look at one of the peculiar blood stains on the shroud the one in the hair shaped like a question mark/ I say it’s interpretation – the sort that is used routinely by those who employ microscopes in pathology and botany labs. To describe it as “speculation” when you probably haven’t taken the trouble to read any of my postings is just idle and gratuitous sniping. So what else is new? setting aside your pompous tone I will go through your blog ( which is not equal to the postings on theis one, since you do not post any objections, just your views). Well, let’s start – this one is already a bogus remark: Yes, one might ask how blood could trickle down hair as if the latter were a smooth surface like skin, crossing effortlessly from strand to strand The answer is – very simple – if there is a vessel damaged, which is a very easy option on the head, as it is highly vascularized, the blood can trickle down hair as if the latter were smooth surface, like skin – anybody who have seen the cutting of the skin in the head have seen how quickly and to any direction blood trickles through the hair. Ok, reading further, one can easily see that you are interpreting what you see not as what you see, but what you WANT to see – mainly to fit it your theory of the Shroud being a painting forgery. So called gap could not be flaking off at all – flaking off at one spot is not flaking off, but purposeful scraping off ( which is possible), but rather than being scraped off it looks much more like a stain of some liquid over the blood, which just dilutes it. The other part – if the body image is not a whole blood stain – why do you expect it to flake off? nobody knows how the image appeared on the cloth, but there is absolutely no reason to expect it to flake off, or wash off, or watever, so it being there does not prove ANYTHING in the domain what is been on the Shroud first – and you clearly want the image to be first. Same is pertinent to your description of the “wishbone” – those spots, or gaps which you want to be flaking off look more like diluted by other liquid spots, not even scraping of the dry blood, but clearly wet dilution.Change of color clearly proves that – flaking or just dry scraping off won’t make such a change in the coloring, wet dilution or washing out – will. Overall, from your block it is clear that you WISH to prove that image was painted ( though you do not have any idea how) first, and then blood stains were forged over it. But your arguments have no validity in proving that, because you can not prove it experimentally – not knowing HOW the image appeared. There is also no proof that the image can not be superimposed over the stains, without interfering with them – all these speculations about flaking, scraping off ( which do not look like ones at all) are not proof to what was there first. The image might have appeared together with the blood – did you ever thought about that?.","date":"2013-04-14","mins":"3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"id":"comment-30751","author":"jesterof","post":"Colinsberry : Most of the original blood has probably flaked off, or was washed out.

But they’re closely related. You refer to “when a person experiences DEATH”. But the definition of death is disputed, and ND Es occur under a wide variety of circumstances. For example, they sometimes occur when death is being anticipated, but prior to the event that’s expected to cause it (e.g. A falling person leaving his body and seeing it fall before it hits the ground). Or they occur during the normal course of surgery, when the body is shut down in some way, but the person is expected to survive. To cite one study mentioned in the book by Greyson, et al. That I referenced above, “Whereas 82.5 percent of persons having the NDE believed they had been near death, medical records confirmed their claims in only 45 percent of cases.” (27 28) And having been “near death” isn’t the same as having died. The study of felons that I cited is noteworthy because of the involvement of felons. They’re a class of people who tend to have low moral character. But the same type of result (the nature of the experience not corresponding with the moral character of the experiencer) has been demonstrated in ND Es as well. Even if we were to set aside the felons study for the sake of argument, the same conclusion would remain. You can be a good person by common human standards, yet have a negative NDE. You can be a bad person by common standards, yet have a positive NDE. It happens frequently. And some of the ND Es are mixed (partly good and partly bad) or neutral in some significant way. If the person is not in clinical death stage I find it hard to relate his/her experience as connected to death – deep coma but with heart beating and perfusing is physiologically totally different state than clinical death( that is why I do not include Dr.Alexander’s experience as the most valid of ND Es). The European studies on ND Es excluded the experiences of other situations, except the valid clinical death – to cut off possible accusations of possible confounding bias – and rightfully so, Death visions BEFORE actual death are not even close to described ND Es – at least not those in the link to the study you have provided – in terms of actual basic conditions they have to meet. Seeing relatives and experiencing calm is a common note, but it is not the same as the core elements of the classic features of ND Es – leaving one’s body, going through a tunnel, floating and so on. Deathbed visions do not have the experience of LEAVING THE BODY – and that is a fundamental difference, in my opinion..","date":"2013-07-27","mins":"10:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/26/near-death-experiences-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Near Death Experiences and the Shroud of Turin?"},{"id":"comment-39862","author":"jesterof","post":"Those are THEIR personal IMH Os, nothing more.

It has nothing to do with NDE – neither of the felons experienced NDE, but a near death visions and obviously, those can have some resembling features, but they can not be equated to ND Es as they are a different category whatsoever. The importance of this understanding this distinction is necessary to not be tempted to base the conclusion made earlier, that negativity of the ND Es is not connected to the person experiencing it. Felon study about deathbed visions absolutely can not be considered as a proof of this assumption since deathbed vision in no way are equal to ND Es.

It is difficult to conduct and experiment based study on such matters, so the studies on ND Es are by definition are going to be observational, which also differ in their validity.

Dr. Jack Finegan, an emeritus professor at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif., and author of “The Handbook of Biblical Chronology,” a standard reference on the subject, now puts Herod’s death more likely at 1 B.C. John Mosley, program director at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and an expert on the Star of Bethlehem, said that while it may never be possible to know what the star was, “when Herod died was an actual event and should be knowable.” And if Herod died in 1 B.C., he added, “you can’t stretch the birth of Jesus back to 6 or 7 B.C.” If this is correct, then the age of Jesus Christ in mid 30s is even more substantiated Luke 3:23 Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli, and we know that Jesus Christ was crucified during the reign of Pontius Pilate which is known to be from AD 26–36, so if the Herod’s death is pushed to 1 BC, than jesus Christ birth is also pushed to maximum 3 BC, which makes the latest possible date of his crucifiction by 36 AD and his latest age at 39 and the earliest at 29.
