However I am not sure the same process can be attributed to blood stains – in alive person hypokalemia is RELATIVE – the K concentration is lower in plasma as K is pushed into the cells, but if one lyses the cells the total amount of K is going to be balanced – because it will come back from the cells into the plasma ( together with all other ingredients of the cell). In a bloodstain yoiu have both cells and plasma components, so amount of potassium is unchanged( because it is a summary of plasma potassium and cell potassium).Please explain why do you make this conclusion – hypokalemia in the stain proves the alcalotic washout of the cloth.And what does hydroxiproline has to do with this? some amount of hydroxiproline is always present in the blood stream ( as a metabolyte of collgaen) it may increase upon certain conditions, but how is it related to the alcaline solution?Thanks.","date":"May 31, 2013 at 1:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Yannick Clément :Adler had already an answer for this lack of potassium and it was because most of it would have been stayed inside the clot and have not been released in the exudates that have stained the cloth…that’s mot an answer.

Zugibe thought that they were caused by an oozing of liquid post-mortem blood after the removal of the dried clots by a vigorous washing while Barbet (and also Adler) conclude that these stains were made of exudates of blood clots that were still humid enough (Adler) or that became re-moistened thanks to the release of water vapor by the corpse (Barbet), so they could leave the kind of precise mirror imprints of themselves on the cloth.

The main argument against that is the fact that there is absolutely no smudge of blood that would have been caused by an oozing of post-mortem blood in liquid form, particularly in the region of the back, which would certainly have happened if only a few clots would have been removed thanks to the washing (which, in my mind, would have certainly happened in a few places, even if the washing would have been done very mildly).  Also, the simple fact that dirt have been found in the region of the heels and knees is another strong argument agains the idea of a washing (whether it be a gentle or a vigorous washing).  Effectively, I don’t see the Jews of Jesus time (who were very meticulous normally) leaving evident traces of dirt on very exposed body parts like the knees…  Finally, if the Shroud is the genuine shroud of Jesus, the idea of a washing has to be seen in contradiction with the Gospel accounts of an hasty and incomplete burial because of the arrival of the Sabbath and Passover feast.  Along with these strong arguments, I’m sure that if I think about it for some time, I will come up with some more arguments…  But the 3 I just bring you are solid enough to understand that a gentle washing of the body is unlikely… I GIVE UP :-)you do not understand what I am asking and keep repeating the same nonsense – I have never ever even talked about the WHOLE BLOOD oozing or not.My whole point that the wounds I am referring to could not have been whole blood at all","date":"June 2, 2013 at 7:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Yannick Clément :I have to say that the formulation of your question is not easy to understand for a French speaking quebecer like me.  Can you ask it again in more clear terms please?  Ithought you were pretending that there was no différences between an halo of serum caused by the clot retraction process of blood clotting and an halo of serum caused by an oozing of post-mortem bleeding.  In the case of the Shroud, Adler and Barbet were precise about the fact that the halo of serum (which were first described by Barbet and later confirmed by Miller and Pellicori as also by Adler) were caused by the phenomenon known as clot retraction when the clot is in his drying phase on the skin.  I have a hard time to believe an oozing of post-mortem blood that would be surrounded by some serum would cause the same kind of bloodstains we see on the Shroud that are surrounded by very nice serum halos.  If we believe Barbet and Adler’s conclusions, this kind of serum halo cannot come from anything else than exudates of humid blood clots.  And for Barbet, even the big blood flow under the side wound was caused by exudates of a very recent blood clot that was still very humid (because it never got time to dry completely before the body was placed inside the Shroud). my formulation is as clear as possible in this situation – English is not my first language as well, though it is my professional languagethe point is you are stubbornly talking about whole blood where there won’t be whole blood, mostly plasma","date":"June 2, 2013 at 8:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Yannick Clément :Zugibe DID thought that the scourge wounds were caused by an oozing of fresh post-mortem blood and this is in total contradiction with Barbet and Adler’s conclusion.

Thewashing (by the way I already said that the term “vigorous” was from me to avoid people could think of a simple rising without any wash) proposed by him would REMOVE THE DRY CLOT COMPLETELY and produce an oozing of LIQUID BLOOD.  How can you get an oozing of something else than liquid blood if you remove the dry clot of the wound?  It’s evident you will get an oozing of LIQUID BLOOD.  And Barbet was categorical about that:  Except in the region of the feet, there is no bloodstains on the Shroud that were made by a transfer of liquid blood.  It’s not me who talk, it is Barbet.

First of all, most of the blood within the scourge wounds of the victim would have been clotted and the blood located both at the periphery and outside of the wounds would have dried long before the victim was placed on the cross.According to the experiments of Lavoie et al., a cloth would have to be placed on a moist clot no later than 2 ½ hours after bleeding stopped ( 5 ). In addition, these authors indicate that moistened clots have to be transferred within an hour for a good mirror image transfer to take place.Forgetting all of the other wounds, no one would argue that the scourge wounds were made and clotting begun several hours prior to death. Moreover, most forensic experts agree that the Man of the Shroud shows evidence of rigor mortis because of the bent knees and absence of a neck, therefore indicating that the crucified was dead for some time before being taken down from the cross. Thus, according to the studies of Lavoie’s group, these perfectly defined wounds should not have transferred at all. Yet many of the scourge wounds on the Shroud of Turin are extremely distinct corresponding to dumbbell shaped wounds. Even if the clots from these wounds satisfied the time and moisture criteria postulated by Lavoie’s group, the shape of the scourge wounds including the bloody areas around the wounds would be indistinct and extremely variable in size and shape depending on the depth of the wound, the angle of the wound, the amount of blood flow, the flow pattern and whether or not clothing was adherent to the wounds. Moreover, even if the dripping sweat of the crucified softened some of the dried blood in areas just outside these wounds, only indistinct and variable-shaped impressions would result. However, if the body was washed, the dried blood around the wounds would be removed causing an oozing of bloody material within the wounds resulting in the production of relatively good impressions of the wound. In order to test this hypothesis, pieces of linen and paper towels were gently touched (not pressed) against wounds from accident victims who lived for several hours following the accident. Relatively no impressions were made. This was repeated after the wounds were rinsed with water and allowed to soak on the wounds for several minutes. Only indistinct bloody impressions were made. The wounds were then washed and this procedure tried again. This resulted in reasonably good impressions of the wounds ( Fig. 1 ). “","date":"June 5, 2013 at 3:38 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"bloody material is what it is  – bloody material, which incorporate  anything bloody, clots included.","date":"June 5, 2013 at 4:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"and since when BLOODY MATERIAL is a liquid post-mortem blood?bloody material can be moistened blood clot inside the wound.Learn the terms first.","date":"June 5, 2013 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Yannick Clément :And can you prove to me that a washing of the dry clot will produce an oozing of a moistened blood clot everytime?

Upon laying the body to the Shroud the pressure would cause the imprints to reflect the shape of the wound ( unlike the not-that-exact shape on the Zugibe’s figure).If the skin is not washed – there is no way one would have such exact shaped marks in a form of a blood stain appear on the cloth.No conflict with what Barbet wrote whatsoever.","date":"June 5, 2013 at 4:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/29/a-guest-posting-by-yannick-clment-two-quotes-about-the-blood/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting by Yannick Clément: Two Quotes About the Blood"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Yannick Clément :which Zugibe pretend is exactly how the scourge marks where formed on the Shroud, following a washing (vigorous enough to remove the dried clot – is it good enough for you now?) of the body.New confabulations?

He had pulmonary edema. Pericardial effusion has nothing to do with it.“Those who were flogged would often go into hypovolemic shock, a term that refers to low blood volume. In other words, the person would have lost so much blood he would go into shock. The results of this would be1) The heart would race to pump blood that was not there.2) The victim would collapse or faint due to low blood pressure.3) The kidneys would shut down to preserve body fluids.4) The person would experience extreme thirst as the body desired to replenish lost fluids.He did not loose much blood. He was in shock – but not because of the blood loss but becasue of pain, severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysisyour results as 1,2,3, can cause a smile, because those are just bites of what is going on in a human body in the shock conditions. They are not incorrect, they are simply just some of. And one might be tachycardica and hypertensive prior to becoming bradycardic ad hypotensive  –  or another combination of parameters – depending on a time frame.Since Jesus did not loose blood massively adn severe dehydration does not egual severe hemorrhage, the last terminal stage of shock ( hypotension,bradycardia and death) would not develop in a 12 hour time frame.There is evidence from Scripture that Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock as a result of being flogged.No there is no such evidence becasue He did not have hypovolemic shock hwile carrying the croos to Gogotha – he was in a pain shock and was developing severe dehydration, but this was still not hypovolemic shock.He fell down not because of the hypotension ( if that would be the case, He would not get up) but because of lot of trauma after scourging and the heaviness of the cross – that was too much. Another indicator that Jesus suffered from hypovolemic shock was that He declared He was thirsty as He hung on the cross (John 19:28), indicating His body’s desire to replenish fluids.which not a proof of hypovolemic SHOCK just a proof of hypovolemia as a result of dehydration. One does not have to be in shock and still be hypovolemic. As I stated above – if His fall would be from hypotension  as a late stage of shock ( which is usually seen quickly only upon severe hemorrhage, not dehydration – that is more prolonged) He would not be able to get up and would have died there – o the road.Prior to death, the sustained rapid heartbeat caused by hypovolemic shock also causes fluid to gather in the sack around the heart and around the lungs.I can guarantee you He was having tachycardia from the agony in Gethsemane.And rapid heartbeat does not cause fluid to gather in the pericardium or around the lungs. Not even in a week time frame, and we are talking here hours – that is not enough time for pleural effusion or pericardial effusion to accumulate. This gathering of fluid in the membrane around the heart is called pericardial effusion, and the fluid gathering around the lungs is called pleural effusion. This explains why, after Jesus died and a Roman soldier thrust a spear through Jesus’ side (probably His right side, piercing both the lungs and the heart), blood and water came from His side just as John recorded in his Gospel (John 19:34).No it does not explain it – because there is no way enough fluid will accumulate in the pericardium or pleural space in less than 12 hours we have, unless the fluid is blood as a result of mechanical trauma ( which is not the case)Interstitial fluid from the lungs is a result of pulmonary edema which was one of the causes of death and which developed already after crucifixion – and pulmonary edema is a result of acute heart failure with literally flooding of the lungs with interstitial fluid The explanations for the blood and water flow are closely related at several points. All physicians who have examined the question agree that Jesus was already dead when the chest wound was inflicted. The blood and water most probably flowed from both the heart and the chest cavity.That is true, but blood is ALWAYS in the heart, which when pierced will give the flow of the blood and it is also always in the lungs – lungs are filled with blood, because they are the filter for it, so to say, so piercing of the lungs will cause blood flow as well – no need to additional accumulation of blood anywhere. Fluid is a result of the pulmonary edema, which was a process preceding death and basically the cause of such a rapid death","date":"June 14, 2013 at 9:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Angel :I just saw a paragraph attached to an article on Kleinfelter (Kleinfelter’s) where it was stated it would be interesting to test Lincoln for Kleinfelter’s, since he was tall and lanky.

That was a remark by someone at the bottom of an article I was reading and it was in reference to Abe being tall and lanky.Males with Marfan’s syndrome are also tall and lanky and the connective tissue is weakened, which causes other problems.  From what I’ve read  there is a defect, with reference to the production of the protein fibrillin.Lincoln could not have had Marfan’s syndrome because his hands were not long and thin and he couldn’t have had Kleinfelter’s, because he didn’t have enlarged breasts.Now, Jesus was tall.   Jesus’ arms and legs were longer than normal and His hands were long and thin.  As well,Jesus had a long, narrow face, like Senator John Kerry and He had breasts, as is clearly seen on the Shroud frontal image.Therefore, excluding the chromosome count, Jesus’ symptons align more with Kleinfelter’s than Marfan’s.Best,I am sorry, but your reasoning just clearly indicated you neither know what Marfan or Down’s or Kleinfelter is about nor have any idea that there is variability of expression of the syndrome, therefore the statement Lincoln could not have had Marfan’s syndrome because his hands were not long and thin and he couldn’t have had Kleinfelter’s, because he didn’t have enlarged breasts  simply indicates that you do not have idea what you are talking about.Marfan’s can be without long hands and Kleinfelter’s can be without enlarged breasts ( as a matter of fact adult Kleinfelter’s look mostly normal males).But Down’s can not happen without special facial features which makes all of the Down’s syndrome people look alike.","date":"June 14, 2013 at 9:53 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Kelly, don’t you think that overemphasizing one system or one organ is not going to work in the long run?Our body is such a perfect design I keep admiring it.But in it’s entirety, not in corpuscular approachEndorsing “t-cells”, or “R-protein receptor”, or “endorphin release” is, probably, a good money-making move ( since the general public is mostly very uninformed) but it is usually neutral at best.

Below is an excerpt from DougLeatherman, MD, on Jesus’ massive blood loss: “There is muchdisagreement among the authorities as to the scourging. This was aRoman, not a Jewish, custom. The hands were tied high to a tree orpost. A whip was made of a short wood handle and heavy leatherstraps bearing usually the sharp bones of sheep knuckles or leadballs on the ends. The Jews forbade more than forty lashes (thirtynine was the maximum allowed), but the Romans did not have thislimit. The scourging was usually carried out by a Roman soldier.The whip was brought down upon the bare back, cutting the skinfirst; then as the beating progressed, the muscles were laid bare,bruised and bleeding with marked loss of blood. In a significantnumber of instances this was enough to kill a man. Ribs werebroken, nerves exposed. Again and again, down came the whip untileither death or unconsciousness occurred. Both venous and arterialbleeding occurred. Large deep, dark, bruised surfaces began toappear. Finally the skin of the back is hanging in long shreds. Thewhole area is an unrecognizable mass of torn, bleeding tissue.”http://www.churches-of-christ.net/tracts/job004u.htmHere is an image of the flagrum that was used on Jesus’ scourging.Note the metal balls attached to the leather whip. http://www.indyprops.com/pp-flagrum.htmTherefore, a massive blood loss from 60 lashes would be anunderstatement.

In addition, serious trauma can cause tearing of major blood vessels without external trauma indicative of the damage.”http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExsanguinationInternal bleeding was evident when Jesus was pierced with the sword (blood and water poured out).Excerpt:“A number of forensic pathologists have examined the descriptions (and, in some cases, information on the Shroud of Turin).

But, they agree that the heart is surrounded by the pericardium, which contains a watery fluid and a lance thrust would have extracted this fluid, which would look like water.The thrust would also have pierced the heart, drawing accumulated blood.

Exactly 1000 ml?I suspect that you did not, therefore this amount, or 500 ml or 2 liters are somewhat theoretical for you and you easily throw the figures and the causes, because you have never experienced it in reality.One can not loose even 500 ml from a nose bleeding and mouth bleeding, unless somebody has a very severe case of hemophilia.This is impossible simply because we are designed that way – otherways we would be extinct already. our defense mechanisms prevent us loosing even 100 ml of blood because of the nose bleed. or mouth bleed.A blood loss of a liter( without replacement) in a most case scenarios leads to severe morbidity and sometimes mortality, depending on a situationIn Jesus case if he would loose a litr of blood upon scourging or have had an internal bleeding of that amount as a result of some blunt trauma ( it does have to be severe) he won’t survive the road to Calvary. real internal bleeding the ones you have heard about, and connect to here  are acute life threatening conditions and lead to the OR STAT, or otherwise they end up in a morgue.Angel :The Sudarium was in direct contact with Jesus’ head and it was noted by the Sudarium scientists how much blood Jesus had lost from the head, mouth and nose.  Since the Sudarium sopped up most of the blood, what blood is displayed on the Shroud is not indicative of Jesus’ total blood loss.My statement was Jesus lost approximately half his blood supply.  A man’s total blood supply is anywhere from 5 to 6 liters; therefore, 2.5 to 3 liters is what I predicted.Best,The Sudariuum does not prove in any way your hypothesis of massive blood loos.

In brief – DIC at the stage of absence of coagulation factors because of their consumption at the initial stage resembles totally antigoagulated state. There are no factors in palsma and severe thrombocytopenia as well. the new factors are simply not yet synthetized by the body and if DIC is not treated the pt can simply die because f the hemorrhage – from every orifice of the body.

There are plenty of hydroxyproline assay kits available on a market – both for serum and urine measurement.Hydroxyproline is produced by hydroxylation of the amino acid proline by the enzyme prolyl hydroxylase following protein synthesis (as a post-translational modification).Hydroxyproline is a major component of the protein collagen.Proline hydroxylation requires ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The most obvious, first effects (gingival and hair problems) of absence of ascorbic acid in humans come from the resulting defect in hydroxylation of proline residues of collagen, with reduced stability of the collagen molecule, causing scurvy.Increased serum and urine levels of hydroxyproline have also been demonstrated in Paget’s disease.","date":"April 4, 2013 at 4:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"so there is no wavelength of the absorbtion of the stains, only subjective waving in the air of the term “too red” or”looking(sic!!!) fresh”, am I correct?","date":"April 8, 2013 at 10:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"You are talking of McCrone personal.

As for your attempting to dismiss the Shroud blood colour anomaly, I can only repeat what I said earlier: no one on this site had any trouble with Adler pointing it out, not while there was an authenticity-promoting narrative to account for it – that fanciful bilirubin story. It’s only when I come along, first pointing out (a year ago) that bilirubin could never have survived intact for centuries in Shroud bloodstains, and then, just a couple of days ago reported here a quotation from 1999 in which Adler himself had acknowledged as much, that all of a sudden there is no red anomaly, that it is all just a figment of our imaginations.If there were no spectral signature for that red anomaly, then how could Adler have claimed to have modelled it with combinations of methaemoglobin and bilirubin? Are you aware that it is not me you are contradicting, so much as Alan D.Adler?  Speaking for myself, I have no objection to your doing that – but do make an effort to maintain a modicum of scientific and logical consistency.It does not matter WHOM I am contradicting, because as I have stated at the very beginning – the whole concept of too bright, too fresh or too red – is flawed, IMHO, as it is based on the subjective evaluation. If Adler picked up the battle – it is not my concern, but his own evaluations have shown the wavelengths of the samples way below the 600 nm of the live blood I was initially referring to.The wavelength absorption of the whole blood depends on it’s pH, the hemoglobin concentration and some other conditions, which are applicable to dried blood as well.Why did he picked up the battle with bilirubin ( which is not a stable compound, does not interfere with live blood spectrophotometry, at least the one used for pulse oximetry evaluation) I do not know.I am not defending him in particular, I am trying to find out what started this strange description  “the blood on the Shroud looks too fresh” when the data does not support this assumption at all.","date":"April 10, 2013 at 3:49 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"One more to add – the wavelength absorption differs dramatically depending on the method used.

The photographs I have seen of the Shroud and the stains do not look out of ordinary, at least not for somebody who works in the operating room and in the ICU and sees blood stains all the time – of all possible hues of red. Some of the blood , even dried is never black as in one of your quotes is suggested. Some dry on tissues and remain red, bright red. If there is addition of mucous material to the blood, it will never darken even to brown.In medical school I have also had a year of forensic pathology course ( I was very interested in that area at some point, but ended up treating alive people, not analyzing their remains) and from that course and later from experience and extensive exposure to all types of body fluids I can attest that blood stains are very different in their colors, blood stains are not always made by the whole blood as one imagines when they have the blood drawn for the blood samples. Diluted or hemolyzed blood, will stain in one color, severe bilubinemia might add additional hue, methemoglobinemia as carboxyhemoglobinemia are definetely different and so on. But the most important is the material stained, since the medium of the material might act as a stabilizer, fixator or reducer of a kind – chemical reactions of blood contents and contents of the stained material can also make the color different or more persistent.Since the Shroud has been under severe fire at least twice – the amount of CO potentially reacting with the stains or any other chemicals in fumes potentially can reduce already oxidized material of the heme and change the color.We can not compare the color from before the fire and after the first fire, but it is certainly possible with the 1997 fire.This is just my speculation from the top of my head.To put it simply – I find differences in colors of blood stains not to be of any particular interest, since variations are very wide and that could even be seen on the photos I’ve provided in my links.","date":"April 4, 2013 at 8:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"You are very welcome, Kellyhere are some more pictures to show what I mean by the staining material and differences in color :http://shs.westport.k12.ct.us/forensics/08-blood/bloodstains.htmthose flashcards are almost perfect in describing how and why color may differ:http://www.slideshare.net/rolfok/ageing-bloodstainsthere are plenty of links on google if one types” color of blood stains in forensic analysis” or similar word combinations.","date":"April 4, 2013 at 9:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Although not mentioned by Bollone, CO binding to the free heme group (separated from the hemoglobin polypeptide) has an affinity 20,000x greater than oxygen-it is unknown by me (or several whom I have contacted) if this is superglued in or given in would exchange as well.

We all know that if we cut a finger and tie a handkerchief around it, the initial vivid red of the fresh blood will rapidly change to a dull brown, usually within a few hours. Yet at long ago as the early sixteenth century one Antoine de Lalaing deescribed the Shroud bloodstains as ‘clear as if they had been made today’. Vignon, viewing the Shroud the 1930s, described the colour as mauve carmine”.this is laughable. Those are real serious arguments of the people who are supposedly specialists on blood stains? or are they just simply lay people as are abundant here on the blog who have seen only blood brom the finger cut?This man did not have his finger cut. he has been first subjected to beating and ripping of his skin – which by results does not even resemble finger cut, his wounds were not clear cut knife single wound, those were blunt, cut, ripped and all combinations possible wounds. Then he was carrying a very heavy object a long way under scorching sun, which leads to dehydration, rhabdomyolysis and DIC. And severe traumatic shock because of the pain as well.Have you ever had a blister on a foot? such a bad blister, that it fills with blood-tinged lymph? Guess what, the stain from that blister with the blood would not look like the stain from clear knife cut finger.And the stain from the blood tinged interstitial fluid from the lungs will also look different.Not to mention the stains from the sipping diluted blood from all orifices of the person who is suffering from DIC.And the bloody urine will stain even more differently.Bloody sputum, bloody saliva, bloody gastric contents wiill ALL look differently as stain.Khm. mnestrrual blood stains also look differentlyEven blood stains from the initial cut during the start of the operation and the blood stains afterwards – stain differnetly.","date":"April 5, 2013 at 7:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Kelly Kearse :# 65-asking specifically about the Shroud-some skeptics are adamant that it’s just applied pigment; some accept that it’s blood, but believe that it had to be painted on as theShroud is bogus-generally, the opinion is not voiced from skeptics that the bloodstains look phony, therefore the Shroud must be fake, but rather that the Shroud is fake, so the bloodstains must have been applied.

Certainly there are probably many lay people here on the blog who have only seen blood from a finger cut-there have also been the reports of those that have been medically trained that have commented on the red color of the blood on the Shroud- #33.It is understandable, even by lay people, that “bloody sputum, bloody saliva, bloody gastric contents, [bloody urine], blood stains from the initial cut during the start of the operation and the blood stains afterwards  will ALL look differently”, but are all of those types of stains represented on the Shroud, ventral & dorsal?Don’t get me wrong, I value your input and am surely trying your patience, but a couple of the issues I am unsure about are:To me (the untrained), many of the stains on the Shroud appear to have a similar color-is this expected, or given the plethora of bloody origins, would more variation be more like it?Second, experience with bloodstains, etc.-as some have also pointed out, does this fully apply to aged bloodstains?  Maybe you are convinced it does-I would like to understand as well.I’ve had lots of blisters on my feet, blood-filled yes; bruises, cuts on my face, blood-filled (pugilism), cuts on my fingers, yes, I can appreciate the variation.  As mentioned above, for me, maybe for others, that’s some of the issue: are the bloodstains on the forehead, back of the head, wrists believed to have been elevated similar color as many others, more anatomically positioned to contain blood from sputum, gastric juices, saliva, interstitial fluid, blood urine, etc.Kelly, you are not trying my patience at all. I gladly can explain what I can, and the variance in bllod stains is one of my daily work ( not as a major, obviously, bot as a constant visible side effect).There is no reason to think that if a blood stain from venous hematoma differs from a blood stain of the blood-stinged sputum, those same stains in 100, 25 or 1967 years later will look alike, provided, they all were subject to the SAME conditions.What I am trying to make you see is a picture as a whole, not just blood stains, which an ordinary person usually sees after an accidental cut or bruise ( but even those differ in appearance, healing and marking the environment) I am used to look at the patient as a whole, since it is critical care medicine. An orthopedist might see only broken bones and holes, a cardiologist might just refer to pulmonary edema as a result of the acute left ventricular failure, a wound specialist would probably mourn the skin lacerations and probability of generalized infections, but a critical care specialist will have to look at a patient as a whole – including his skin disruption which resembles burns, multiorgan failure, dehydration, DIC, rhabdomyolysis and severe trauma. In surgical and trauma ICU those combinations happen all the time and as a side effect to treating those patients one can appreciate a variety of esthetics which include not only the wide range of possible deformities, discolorations and exudate of the human body, but also their reflection on the tissues, commonly known as stains.Now the other part, which I have tried to express before – the coloring of the stains NOW, or in the previous century has nothing to do with the initial coloring caused by the bodily fluids or their combinations. First, the cloth could have been prepared – impregnated by specific means; second – the body could have been also coated by specific substances; third – during whatever period of time the cloth with originally colored stains might have been subjected to influence by the fluids, fumes, temperature changes and light influence, which could have changed the initial coloring, as, for example happens when some wants to remove stains from the caret, clothing, furniture – not that the staining was a subject of removal, but as a result of accidental or not accidental influence.Methods of conservation do matter as well – since we do not know what were the conditions for centuries, claiming that the color of the stains are the proof of their artificial origin is childish, to say the least.Since the whole arguments of the “color skeptics” are basically – ” that’s the way I see it” without even trying to look for the whole picture, one starts to think – are all other skeptical arguments of the same amateurish level?","date":"April 5, 2013 at 8:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Kelly Kearse :#70-OkayWhat are your thoughts regarding the serum halos rings around the wounds, visible under uv light?you will have the same if the above mentioned blister stained a cloth.It just means that the stain is of a mixed origin – blood with interstitial fluid, for example.The stain from the WHOLE blood will happen if one has a clear surgical cut, as from the knife.

How familiar are you with 100 year old blood (from, say Museums of the First World War?), 200 year old blood (Napoleonic?), 500 year old blood (European wars?). My point is that an expertise of various traumas is only the beginning of an understanding of how medieval blood can be described, with or without any medical knowledge, as “fresh.”I already answered that question – if the appearance of blood stains INITIALLY is different there is no reason to think that in 10, 100. 500 or 1967 years they will start to look the same, no matter what the origin of the stain. If the other conditions are the same.If you stain one cloth with whole blood, the other same loth with bloody stinged lymph and the third – with bloody mucous – and place them in the same container with the same temperature and environmental exposure, they will still look differently in 10, 100 or 100 years, if they look differently initially.The amount of difference should be studied by experiment.","date":"April 6, 2013 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/04/blood-clotting-and-the-strange-case-of-brother-hirudo/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Blood Clotting and the Strange Case of Brother Hirudo"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"DIC an enhanced anticoagulation( there is no coagulation at all – blood sips from any minor scratch) which is an simple and obvious explanation both to leakage from the body and wet staining the cloth.

If one applies whole blood – the stains would be of one color, if one applies the mixture of blood and saliva, for instance – they will be different.The halo markings do not prove or disprove the transfer or application – they only prove that the stain is not the whole blood.

UV light just help to prevent the kernicterus by changing the bilirubin from it toxic form to non-toxic ( to the brain)2.

Maybe that’s why some members of STURP had some preconcieved ideas about a potential problem with the color of the blood…  That would explain many things.  I really would like to know who started this whole issue.Well, by Louis’s link one can assume it was actually described after the Shroud being outside the Cathedral for Exposition in 1931 in a bright sunlight by many – some of the witnesses were able to see the Shroud later and were even surprised it is not that bright anymore ( the above mentioned Lagrand), but others did not and since most of the people are not medical doctors and often do not pay attention to such details, the legend of being “too red” rolled out into the masses :-) So you are right, some memebers of STURP team might have had the preconcieved ideas about the coloring.However, one has to read the exact words told by STURP members in order to judge, because I suppose they did know it is “too red” only under special conditions – as it was known to researchers before – the folks repeating the idea did not bother to remeber the difference and the words ( probable) ” it is very bright upon sun light exposure” changed just to “it’s too bright” – this is a standard psychological turn, since if most of the people won’t consider “sunlight ( or UV) exposure” to be the most pertinent part of the sentence.Just speculating :-)","date":"May 26, 2013 at 9:52 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Likewise :)Good night, everybody.It was a great discussion.","date":"May 26, 2013 at 10:07 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"2A.

It’s been proposed by some investigators that the blood was affected during the process that created the image. The “upset” by neutrons is referred to an experiment conducted by Italian group of researchers. As I understand they do not used the Shroud samples, they irradiated blood samples with a high level of bilirubin by neitrons. After that they tested one sample in the oven heating and the other one by UV light ( both were irrdiated by neutrons first). The first did not change it color, the other did in 30 minutes to bright red. They conclude that irradiation “upset” the blood and that is why the color changed.One might agree with this or not, but the other experiments described above have shown that the blood sample with bilirubin changed the color upon UV irradiation without any “neutron upset”.Personally, I do not think any “neutroen upset” has anything to do with the blood color change.","date":"May 27, 2013 at 11:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"2B.

Also, in terms of laboratory experimentation to create a blood simulacra, are these the levels that are necessary? Adler remarked in one of his spectra descriptions using finger stick blood samples, that the amount of protein (albumin) they added was too high, so this would be in excess of that.Any numbers on bilirubin levels for normal versus elevated versus extreme traumatic death?the normal level of bilirubin depending on the system used is     Direct bilirubin: 0.1 mg/ dl to 0.3 mg/ dl (1.7 mmol/ l to 5.1 mmol/ l)    Indirect bilirubin: 0.2 mg/ dl to 0.8 mg/ dl (3.4 mmol/ l to 12.0 mmol/ l)    Total bilirubin: 0.3 mg/ dl to 1.0 mg/ dl (5.1 mmol/ l to 17.0 mmol/ l)NIH.gov gives the upper limit of total level as 1.9 mg/dlLiver failure can be with both very high and very moderate bilirubin levels, level for one patient might be nit that toxic for the other and yellowness of the skin and mucosa differs as well.Bilirubin level 500 times higher the normal will take some time to accumulate, so that particular level is probably not a reference here ( if trauma patient is being treated than it might accumulate, but if one dies, probably not)I have to leave now and will be back in the evening and will answer the questions gladly.In general just as a remark – it is difficult to predict one’s body response to any one given factor to have a simulacra since as I have stated before – clinical picture and actual picture depends not on one factor of bilirubin, there are much more in the clinical picture we are discussing and all of them might have influence on the results.

The units used are just the units used, it is an agreed method, the spectrophotometry uses the wavelength absorption and then they have to use some mathematical conversion tables. I am not the mathematician or statistician and those details are beyond my knowledge. I can dig on-line to it, but I just do not see what is the confusion.If we calculate the concentration of the substance it does not matter what we will refer to – a stain or serum of the alive patient. You may calculate it by using the presented method by the dried sample on a paper ( and it will tell you how much of the substance is per volume unit of blood, or serum, since those are commonly agreed values of reference) or by measuring the whole amount in a sample of blood which will be exactly 100 ml – but the latter is just impractical.I believe it is an area of analytical chemistry which I’ve studied back in medical school, but forgive me, I have forgotten it long time ago :-)” A thread that received more blood transferred relative to one that received less will appear to have a higher concentration of that protein per surface area, even though the overall levels in the original blood should be equivalent. ”No it would not.

But concerning Al Adler’s hypothesis, I learned from Mr.Kearse that he did some coloration test with different level of bilirubin and the one that came out closer to the color of the Shroud blood was the one with a very high level of bilirubin.  I know that this doesn’t prove that the color would still be red 2000 years later, but don’t you think that this bilirubin hypothesis makes plenty of sense in the context of the Shroud on which we see the body image of a crucified victim who had been very badly tortured?  In such context, everytime I will expect to see a level of bilirubin in the bloodstains much higher than normal!  So, why this hypothesis proposed by Adler would not be the solution for the unusual aspect of the blood color?  Sometimes, the most simple answers are the best.  And this time, this simple answer of Adler fits perfectly well with the context of the burial cloth of a crucified victim.  In my mind, this simple fact give Adler’s hypothesis some crédits.The hypothesis by itself is  valid.The problem is – I do not see those pictures as “too red”They are NORMAL. as they are supposed to be – to my eyes and I am used to all kinds of blood stains – from whole blood, from blood stinged bodily fluids and so on. To dried stains also. Obviously, not ages old, but if the stain form different body fluids with addition to blood do stain in different color when they are fresh or just have dried a day ago, I do not see any reason why should not they differ centuries later as well.Then, somewhere I’ve read that “too red” is referred only to ONE stain as a spike of the absorption waveform to 650nm and all others are below 500nm.But below 500nm is totally where they are expected to be!So do you, personally, know which specific stains are refereed as “too red”, what absorption wavelength are they and what method was used to evaluate them?","date":"May 26, 2013 at 8:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"The fact that they are budged doe not prove anything.Neither of them watched the Shroud in a sunlight.The source of light especially for the photos does change the color and one might not see the diference.People have individual color perception and it is subjective.That’s why I’ve asked – do you know about which particular stain they are talking about, what method of spechtrophotometry was used and what is the absorption wavelenght of the stain in question – everything else is just poetry.From the top of my head I do not recall the STURP membber being very much exposed to a lot of blood and it’s stains.With one exception  Robert Bucklin might have seen those.Did HE also referred to the blood stains as “too red”.Not the physicists, not the photographers, not the chemists – this one person might have the right to determine what is “too red” in a blood stain as he has seen the others as well.","date":"May 26, 2013 at 8:41 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/25/an-important-and-highly-informative-guest-posting-by-paul-maloney/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Important and Highly Informative Guest Posting by Paul Maloney"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Yannick Clément :After reading many comments here from Mr. Kearse and jesterof, I ended up with a very bad headache!

When they reached the cross some time later, they pulled this cloth off his body. Pulling this cloth off the body would have undoubtedly opened up many of the wounds again. Maybe not all, but many. ” Re-opened” wounds tend to take forever to close up again or to stop oozing, in my experience, and is a simple answer to all the blood or exudate of blood found from the scourge wounds.Like David Goulet mentioned above, I like the idea of God sending rain to cleanse the body of Christ, but, it would not explain the absence of dirt on the body by the time they had reached the tomb! If we take the studies on the Sudarium somewhat, and scriptures into account, and maybe a little common sense, Jesus hung on the cross for some time ‘after death’ and before taken down. He was then laid on the ground for a period of time, (possibly in the removal of the nails and/or from the cross). They did not have cobblestone or tiled ground, it was dirty/sandy or possibly muddy  ground! He would have been covered in a excessive amount of dirt with no doubt. Enough dirt to cover most, if not all the body. Hence I still believe a ‘PARTIAL’ washing is evident. Washing does not necessarily mean scrubbing/ wiping, washing would have been a delicate procedure of ‘dabbing’ with a wet sponge or other cloth, which would be essential if trying to avoid lifeblood in the procedure. This could  account somewhat for the dampness which existed within, once the body was enshrouded, especially since time was of the essence and the body would not have had time to dry.Rsounds reasonable","date":"July 17, 2013 at 6:50 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Juliet Faith :To Max Patrick Hamon…very interesting comments…have you ever seen a picture of the Cameley Head?

No I’m not a physician, but I am a biology graduate, so perhaps gave that impression. The point about my nosebleed remark was not that any of the marks weremade by a nosebleed, but that if any of the blood was added by a forger for verisimilitude, he would not need any technical knowledge, just a sponge. Jones’s claim, which attempts to refute the possibility of a Medieval artist on the grounds of lack of microscopical or ultra-violet knowledge, doesn’t make sense.Regarding your point about the difference between blood from a dead body and a live one, the picture is extremely complex, and the shroud is not clear enough for an apples/oranges distinction to be made. As I mentioned, it is possible that the body was washed clean shortly before being laid on the shroud, and that the scourge marks on the back are the result of wounds reopening, or simply seeping. These might be characterised by a lack of red blood cells and an excess of plasma (as you might find by removing a dressing from an open wound before it heals). On the other hand, a forger with a bowl of blood (maybe from a patient who had recently undergone bloodletting) would find he too would have to use it quickly before it too became more plasma than red cells. My own experiments indicate that blood is not at all an easy medium to paint with…I agree totally that it looks like the body was washed before laid in the shroud. On the point about whole blood vs all other bloody material – those are apples and oranges. Whole blood can come and stain only from ALIVE person. A dead body would not sip whole blood ( even if that looks like one)of the same structure as in a live person.The reason I am repeatedly pointing this is that people who are not used to blood and it’s functions tend to project their own experience with bleeding( usually the whole blood) onto the character of staining on the Shroud.and this is not only apples and oranges but apples and beef :-)","date":"July 15, 2013 at 9:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/15/stephen-jones-newest-addition-to-his-shroud-of-turin-series/","cat":"history","title":"Stephen Jones’ Newest Addition to his Shroud of Turin Series"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"That is a valid point, of course, however even at the times of militant atheism not existing these words were said and , sadly, they are true today as they were 2000 years ago :“He said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'”Therefore I doubt modern-time rabid atheists will believe even if they would have a direct proof…some – maybe, but not everybody…","date":"June 15, 2013 at 4:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/14/will-the-alfred-rosenberg-diaries-tell-us-anything/","cat":"history","title":"Will the Alfred Rosenberg Diaries Tell Us Anything?"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"ask them :-)read The Acts.","date":"June 15, 2013 at 6:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/14/will-the-alfred-rosenberg-diaries-tell-us-anything/","cat":"history","title":"Will the Alfred Rosenberg Diaries Tell Us Anything?"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Why would He do that?If His whole teachings are based on trust and belief.And He knew, “For those who believe, no explanation is necessary.

My point is that the Jospice Mattress Imprint is not similar to what you have seen and in fact what has been stressed (in my article) is that which Father Francis O’Leary found difficult to explain and also what the BBC team neglected to take into account. And what is that? How was the the head image imprinted on the mattress by penetrating the pillow. The point is that plastic (brought into the discussion by you) and bilirubin (brought into the discussion by the author of the first article you read, and by two prominent bloggers here), have nothing to do with the imprint formation in this case, so if you want to scream, go ahead, but not at me — at them.There is an easy way to avoid screaming. As you are a newcomer on the scene, read the literature on the topic available on the Internet to be able able to understand what exactly the discussion is about and then come to your conclusions. OK?Louis, I think we are talking in parallel here. The possibility of the imprint on the plastic cover of the mattress might be connected to any of the compounds in the body, which the body can perspirate. Making it through the pillow does not seem anything special for me as I have seen the similar type of reaction and it is not impossible, neither has it  to be connected to any supernatural phenomena. Singling out bilirubin is only because the same compound was previously singled out in connection with th Shroud( IMHO). Bilirubin is neither stable, nor is it very reactive with other media, so making it the main compound is not the best way to explain the imprints.But the body is producing not only bilirubin and in a failing state there are many more aggressive compounds found in the plasma as well. Maybe it was bilirubin, maybe it was not, but the possibility of chemical reaction and leaving traces on covers is not supernatural even if it is penetrating through the pillow or tightly rolled up towel and sheets.oh, and one more thing – being here a long time does not make a blogger infallible in their opinion.

I mentioned those two because they are pungent and one can smell them even with a lot of covers over one’s face, but others can penetrate through different layers as well.That’s why I do not see anything unusual with the possibility of vaporized substances slowly penetrating through the pillow to chemically react with the mattress cover.","date":"May 24, 2013 at 5:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/22/struggling-with-naturalist-explanations/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Struggling with Naturalist Explanations"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"2 Kelly KearseThe blood and plasma rich in glucose/fructose in high concentration will make the other bodily fluids contain them as well – one can assume that the body is basically wet with “sweet” fluids.

To describe it as “speculation” when you probably haven’t taken the trouble to read any of my postings is just idle and gratuitous sniping. So what else is new?setting aside your pompous tone I will go through your blog ( which is not equal to the postings on theis one, since you do not post any objections, just your views).Well, let’s start – this one is already a bogus remark:Yes, one might ask how blood could trickle down hair as if the latter were a smooth surface like skin, crossing effortlessly from strand to strandThe answer is – very simple – if there is a vessel damaged, which is a very easy option on the head, as it is highly vascularized, the blood can trickle down hair as if the latter were smooth surface, like skin – anybody who have seen the cutting of the skin in the head have seen how quickly and to any direction blood trickles through  the hair.Ok, reading further, one can easily see that you are interpreting what you see not as what you see, but what you WANT to see – mainly to fit it your theory of the Shroud being a painting forgery. So-called gap could not be flaking off at all – flaking off at one spot is not flaking off, but purposeful scraping off ( which is possible), but rather than being scraped off it looks much more like a stain of some liquid over the blood, which just dilutes it.The other part – if the body image is not a whole blood stain – why do you expect it to flake off? nobody knows how the image appeared on the cloth, but there is absolutely no reason to expect it to flake off, or wash off, or watever, so it being there does not prove ANYTHING in the domain what is been on the Shroud first – and you clearly want the image to be first .Same is pertinent to your description of the “wishbone” – those spots, or gaps which you want to be flaking off look more like diluted by other liquid spots, not even scraping of the dry blood, but clearly wet dilution.Change of color clearly proves that – flaking or just dry scraping off won’t make such a change in the coloring, wet dilution or washing out – will.Overall, from your block it is clear that you WISH to prove that image was painted ( though you do not have any idea how) first, and then blood stains were forged over it.But your arguments have no validity in proving that, because you can not prove it experimentally – not knowing HOW the image appeared. There is also no proof that the image can not be superimposed over the stains, without interfering with them – all these speculations about flaking, scraping off ( which do not look like ones at all) are not proof to what was there first.The image might have appeared together with the blood – did you ever thought about that?","date":"April 14, 2013 at 3:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"***yawning***yeah, I see, the last word of yours going down the path of linguistics, since there is nothing left.","date":"April 14, 2013 at 5:32 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/11/neat-trick-with-the-shroud-2-0-app/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Neat Trick with the Shroud 2.0 App"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Very strange comment.

But they’re closely related.You refer to “when a person experiences DEATH”. But the definition of death is disputed, and NDEs occur under a wide variety of circumstances. For example, they sometimes occur when death is being anticipated, but prior to the event that’s expected to cause it (e.g. a falling person leaving his body and seeing it fall before it hits the ground). Or they occur during the normal course of surgery, when the body is shut down in some way, but the person is expected to survive. To cite one study mentioned in the book by Greyson, et al. that I referenced above, “Whereas 82.5 percent of persons having the NDE believed they had been near death, medical records confirmed their claims in only 45 percent of cases.” (27-28) And having been “near death” isn’t the same as having died.The study of felons that I cited is noteworthy because of the involvement of felons. They’re a class of people who tend to have low moral character. But the same type of result (the nature of the experience not corresponding with the moral character of the experiencer) has been demonstrated in NDEs as well. Even if we were to set aside the felons study for the sake of argument, the same conclusion would remain. You can be a good person by common human standards, yet have a negative NDE. You can be a bad person by common standards, yet have a positive NDE. It happens frequently. And some of the NDEs are mixed (partly good and partly bad) or neutral in some significant way.If the person is not in clinical death stage I find it hard to relate his/her experience as connected to death – deep coma but with heart beating and perfusing is physiologically totally different state than clinical death( that is why I do not include Dr.Alexander’s experience as the most valid of NDEs). The European studies on NDEs excluded the experiences of other situations, except the valid clinical death – to cut off possible accusations of possible confounding bias – and rightfully so,Death visions BEFORE actual death are not even close to described NDEs – at least not those in the link to the study you have provided – in terms of actual basic conditions they have to meet.Seeing relatives and experiencing calm is a common note, but it is not the same as the core elements of the classic features of NDEs – leaving one’s body, going through a tunnel, floating and so on.Deathbed visions do not have the experience of LEAVING THE BODY – and that is a fundamental difference, in my opinion.","date":"July 27, 2013 at 10:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/26/near-death-experiences-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Near Death Experiences and the Shroud of Turin?"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"those are THEIR personal IMHOs, nothing more.

And the felon study is described there.It has nothing to do with NDE – neither of the felons experienced NDE, but a near-death visions and obviously, those can have some resembling features, but they can not be equated to NDEs as they are a different category whatsoever.The importance of this understanding this distinction is necessary to not be tempted to base the conclusion made earlier, that negativity of the NDEs is not connected to the person experiencing it.Felon study about deathbed visions absolutely can not be considered as a proof of this assumption since deathbed vision in no way are equal to NDEs.The basic difference between NDEs and deathbed visions is the crossing line – ones are BEFORE it and the others – AFTER it.Apples and oranges.Definition of death is not a disputed issue.

Taken at his word, Jesus is clearly saying that he is 46 years old, and that when he dies, he will resurrect in 3 days.

Dr. Jack Finegan, an emeritus professor at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif., and author of “The Handbook of Biblical Chronology,” a standard reference on the subject, now puts Herod’s death more likely at 1 B.C. John Mosley, program director at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and an expert on the Star of Bethlehem, said that while it may never be possible to know what the star was, “when Herod died was an actual event and should be knowable.” And if Herod died in 1 B.C., he added, “you can’t stretch the birth of Jesus back to 6 or 7 B.C.” If this is correct, then the age of Jesus Christ in mid-30s is even more substantiatedLuke 3:23Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry.

Scientifically I do not have an explanation for this child’s recovery.”It does not mean he said EXACTLY THOSE WORDS.It means that what the journalist attributes to him being said.Which1) might be his words ( unlikely)2) might be what the journalist have understood from his words3) might be the journalist confabulation altogether.option 2 has the highest probability.You clearly have too much faith in the integrity and intellect of the media community ))))","date":"July 3, 2013 at 5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"and Hugh’s comment on that “90%” : “If he is correct, he means that one in every ten people in a similar condition recovers spontaneously.

I hope to find the other factors mentioned in #24 because they refer to other causes that may cause incorruption. It seems that depending on whatkind of medicine they took previously, that is, in the days preceding death, some people remain incorrupt, As a physician perhaps you have heard about that?I have not heard about this in particular, since I was not very much into researching the incorrupt bodies ( I just take the word in face value) but one might assume that some medications taken for a long time and in higher concentrations might be a factor. However, I can’t think about anything immediately to have a balm effect. Most of the time whenever the incorruption is mentioned, the physical conditions around the body ( temperature, dryness, air flow) is considered, but as I’ve stated before, this is just memories what I’ve heard or read sometimes somewhere.I would wait until August or September if you will have the possibility to post anything then – I will highly appreciate it.In a meanwhile I’ll try to find something over the web – you got me interested :)","date":"July 5, 2013 at 8:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Thank you, Louis and Dave.Very interesting, indeed.","date":"July 6, 2013 at 7:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/03/a-book-review-of-joe-nickells-the-science-of-miracles/","cat":"books","title":"A Book Review of Joe Nickell’s The Science of Miracles"},{"author":"jesterof","post":"Giorgio :Thibault, Gian Marco Rinaldi did the review on Amazon.it.
