{"misc":[{"id":"comment-5086","author":"beedie","post":"Hi again, Barrie! Several months ago, I referred you to a book written by Knight Lomas: “Second Messiah?” In the appendix of the book was their analysis of the shroud upon which Templar De Molay was laid. When his torturers (priests) got weary, they removed him from the door upon which he had been crucified and laid him down (still barely alive) on the very long piece of fabric and pulled the remaining cloth over him. De Molay and his Templar partner, de Charney were immolated on a tiny island in the River Seine, Paris, France, in 1307. The shroud turned up several hundred years later in the possession of de Charney’s family/relatives, Savoy. The rest is modern history and has very recently been declared NOT Jesus’ shroud by the Pope in Rome..","date":"2011-11-29","mins":"6:18 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/11/01/major-update-to-shroud-com/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Major Update to Shroud.com"}]}
