{"image":[{"id":"comment-3017","author":"olufemi_babalola","post":"I congratulate Prof Luigi on his attempt. However his reporduction falls far short for two reasons. Firstly, he has used red ochre to imprint the image. It has been proven time and again by the STRP team that there are NO pigments on the cloth. NONE. Secondly, the most astounding subtlty on the shroud, the human blood, has been proven to be real. Further the markings on the body of the man in the shroud clearly replicate the shape of the roman flagellum. Wonder if the Prof managed that? finally let someone tell the Prof that the carbon dating has been discredited. The carbon dates ‘confidently’ put the time of the shroud at between 1260 1390. But, the Hungrian prayer codex has a reproduction of the shroud, and has been in existence since at least 1100, a good 160 years before the infamous carbon dates. Historically of course the shroud has been traced back to Edessa, about the third century AD. And the pollens place it definitively in Jerusalem. Did the prof manage to put in some pollens as well?. Jesus Christ shed his blood on the cross of calvary for all of us, christians and athesits alike. But it is up to us to accept him as lour Lord and aviour. It is not tto late, even for Prof Luigi.Happy easter, prof Luigi.","date":"2011-04-25","mins":"10:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/04/25/happy-easter-luigi-garlaschelli/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Happy Easter Luigi Garlaschelli"}]}
