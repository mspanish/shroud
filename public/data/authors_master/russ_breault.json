If water or condensation got into the bottom of the urn it would create the same water stain patterns as seen on the Shroud.  I usually say the stains are from the dowsing of the 1532 fire but it is probably not the case given the repetitive pattern of the water stains over the entire cloth. This relates to the “L” shaped pattern of holes as Mario posted above in that it seemed to be a Jewish symbol circa first century.  So now it has me wondering if the burn hole pattern was just an accident with a Byzantine censor (as I usually say) or a more deliberate symbol applied by first century Jews who may have kept the cloth in an urn until it was taken out of Jerusalem two years prior to 66 when the uprising began that led to the destruction of the temple.  According to Eusebius the faithful were “warned by the Holy Ghost” to leave Jerusalem around 64.  Eusebius writes that all the sacred objects related to Christ were taken to Syria and were dispersed to Beruit, Pella and Edessa. Is it possible that as a symbol of ancient Judaism that the burn hole pattern was kind of Jewish “branding” to establish its authenticity?  I am just speculating…but it has my juices going.\n\n","date":"July 22, 2014 at 9:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/22/origin-of-the-gammadia/","cat":"art","title":"Origin of the Gammadia"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Here is another image showing the Gammadia symbol on an altar cloth showing Abel and Melchezidek.

For clarification, I always tell audiences that the message of the Shroud is Past, Present and Future.  It is past in that it takes us back to the empty tomb–the resurrection seen as a historical event.  It is present in that we can see on the shroud today–in the now–the extreme price that was paid for our salvation.  It is future in that it represents a future event.  Some may dismiss this, but what Paul writes about in 1 Cor 15: 51-53 references a future event…it hasn’t happened yet…but it is exactly what happened to Jesus in the tomb.  How can I say that?  Because Jesus is also called “the first fruits of the resurrection.”  This means that if he is the first fruits…we are the rest of the fruit that follows at a later time.  It is exactly the same concept as when the Jewish high priest was in the temple waving the first fruits of the barley harvest asking God’s blessing on the rest of the harvest.  It is no accident that when Jesus rose from the dead…it was on the Jewish Feast of First Fruits! So my view is that the shroud is a picture of not just a past event but also a foreshadow of a future event as well.  This is how the Shroud fits into a discussion of biblical prophecy.\n\n","date":"June 10, 2014 at 9:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/10/add-to-cart-the-shroud-of-turin-prophecy-package-by-russ-breault/","cat":"lectures","title":"Add to Cart:  The Shroud of Turin Prophecy Package by Russ Breault"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Louis, I like your comment regarding the Resurrection Movement.

AND if we can assume that the blood chemistry is correct, ie Adler, Heller and others, that the blood is in fact blood from actual wounds. Then there are two choices, either the shroud is the result of an actual crucifixion or one that was staged.  The problem with the staged hypothesis, is that as far as we know, corpses do not make images on linen shrouds.  There is nothing else like it in all the museums in the world…only shrouds covered with stains of body decomposition…no images. If it was the result of an actual crucifixion then a simple comparison should reveal the identity. The uniqueness of Christ’s crucifixion are numerous starting with a crown of thorns as a singular mockery as King of the Jews, severe scourging as a last ditch effort by Pilate to release him–he didn’t think he was guilty of a crime worthy of capital punishment–plus he was spooked by his wife’s dream. His  legs were not broken and he received a side wound instead because he was already dead when it came time to remove the bodies–consequence of the scourging no doubt. He was given an individual burial even though most who were crucified were thrown into a common grave.  He was wrapped in a very expensive linen–one suited for a high priestly garment.  All this together would indicate it is probably Jesus.  Is it Conclusive?  Not by today’s scientific standards—but probably enough to hold up in a courtroom as the “preponderance of evidence”–the burden of proof necessary for a civil trial.\n\n","date":"January 26, 2013 at 11:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/25/eric-j-jumper-to-speak-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"event","title":"Eric J.

Nobody dies for a lie.  The body was not stolen.  Who stole it?  Not the apostles–what would be the motive?  Not the Romans or the Jews–their motive was to discredit Jesus not to affirm his deity.  Any theory that does not also explain how this body disappeared is pointless.

Perhaps not everything Vignon identified can be considered unique to the Shroud image but there is a global pattern that allows everyone in the world, whether they believe or not, to see a picture of the Shroud face and know it is Jesus.  Regarding comments as to which one came first…the Shroud or the icon, keep in mind that the earliest descriptions of the Mandylion/Image of Edessa are “The True Likeness” and “Not Made by Human Hands.”  I think even in the 6th century, people were smart enough to know whether something was made with paint or not.  Seeing that the Shroud conforms exactly with the “True Likeness” as depicted in various icon images and we know today from science that it is not the result of artistic substances, ie…”Not Made by Human Hands.”  It is both logical and certain that the Shroud is in fact the original True Likeness discovered or perhaps rediscovered in 525.\n\n","date":"May 20, 2014 at 8:36 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/20/the-vignon-markings-issue-a-promoted-comment/","cat":"art","title":"The Vignon Markings Issue:  A Promoted Comment"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Most alleged relics were small pieces of bone, hair, clothing, etc. Nothing on the order of the Shroud.

I guess it is a matter of style, but I prefer to leave the Shroud as a mystery, a fabulous mystery in the same league as the pyramids or Stonehenge…all of which remain unsolved at their core regarding who and how they were made…many theories but no definitive answer.  As you lecture, make every effort to refrain from dogmatism.  The Shroud could be authentic.  Thats it, that is as far as we can take it.  Who knows…maybe there is a medieval artist out there who predated Leonardo by at least 100 years, and we don’t know who he is, or how he did it.  Not likely I grant you yet still a possibility.  In fact if the Shroud was on trial we would have to look at two burdens of proof…”beyond a reasonable doubt” for a criminal trial and “preponderance of evidence” for a civil trial.  Personally, I don’t think will ever get to “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Preponderance of evidence I would agree with…but that really only means there is better than a 50% chance of it being authentic.  But that is ok.  It is fun to explore the mystery, and as we do, we encounter the heart of the gospel.  I love letting the audience decide.  Is it possible?  Did God preserve an image of himself for an age when we communicate more with images than we do with words?  Is it silent witness to the one miracle that had no eyewitnesses?  All these are tantalizing and wonderful things to ponder.  But at the end of the day, it is up to each person to decide.\n\n","date":"February 26, 2012 at 11:56 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/26/a-rather-silly-blog-with-a-not-sol-silly-shroud-of-turin-lecture/","cat":"history","title":"A Rather Silly Blog with a not so silly Shroud of Turin Lecture"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Nick, \nThat is a wonderful testimony you have shared.

It lines up perfectly with Scripture which makes it a perfect tool to explore what happened to Jesus as we also explore the mystery of the Shroud itself.  The very fact that the Shroud remains a mystery is amazing itself.  If it was an obvious work of art, we would have figured that out a long time ago.

The Shroud remans an unsolved mystery.  In that same vein, so are Stonehenge and the Pyramids.

I am totally focused on how to get the world at large to embrace the Shroud as a legitimate artifact to study and explore.  And the only way (IMO) is by focusing on the mystery and losing the dogmatism.  Once we become so oriented towards claiming and proving it to be authentic, we lose the very people we are trying to reach with the message of the Shroud. I am all for building a case for authenticity. However, carbon 14 will remain an issue until it is dated again.  There remain many reasonable questions that do not yet have adequate answers. I am happy with the Shroud being a mystery.  Who can argue with that?  Whether it is authentic or not, it remains a mystery.  That is what makes it fascinating. If we had all the answers, it wouldn’t be nearly as interesting.  Again, if I didn’t make it clear, I am speaking to my approach in taking the Shroud outside the walls of the Church.\n\n","date":"February 26, 2012 at 11:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/26/a-rather-silly-blog-with-a-not-sol-silly-shroud-of-turin-lecture/","cat":"history","title":"A Rather Silly Blog with a not so silly Shroud of Turin Lecture"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Using the Shroud as a tool for Christian education is terrific idea.  One young woman at a lecture commented that “the Shroud makes it real.”  In the 21st century, as the Church struggles against pervasive secularism and a new and aggressive form of atheism, the Shroud stands as a witness for the core message of Christianity…the bulls eye of the faith. Some evangelicals assert that God would not use something like the Shroud.  Why not?  Jesus said, “If you have SEEN me, you have SEEN the father.”  Paul describes Jesus as, “the image of the invisible God.”  Certainly something dramatic changed between the OT where no one, not even Moses saw the face of God…to the NT where everyone beheld the glory of God in the face of Jesus.  In Acts 1:3, it says, “After his suffering he showed many convincing proofs that he was alive.”  Is it not possible that the Shroud is a “proof” for all generations?  In the 21st century we communicate more images than we do with words.  Perhaps the Shroud was preserved for this time in human history more than any other and has the same message as Scripture, “I am the way, the truth and the life…”\n\n","date":"May 27, 2014 at 7:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/27/the-shroud-as-a-sunday-school-tool/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud as a Sunday School Tool"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"I agree with you Dave.  How someone can spin the finding of a plain weave cloth as proof against the Shroud is nonsense.  It is clearly written in Scripture, “Joseph of Arimathea, A RICH MAN PURCHASED A FINE LINEN CLOTH”.  The Scripture itself lets us know that the cloth was not plain and not ordinary.  In fact, Joseph was a Pharisee, he had access to the temple and the temple store.  The high priest was commanded in Deuteronomy before entering the Holy of Holies to perform the sacrifice, to take off his ordinary clothes and put on clothing made of “fine twisted linen” which represented the holiness of God.  Seems likely that the Shroud was made of fine twisted linen (3:1 herringbone twill with a Z twist) and was purchased directly from the Temple.  Joseph was sending us a message.  He knew who Jesus was, and he IMO, purchased linen worthy of a high priest about to enter the Holy of Holies.\n\n","date":"July 7, 2013 at 7:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/07/nbc-news-on-the-archaeology-of-christianity/","cat":"history","title":"NBC News on the archaeology of Christianity"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Looks interesting!

Hitler visited Italy in 1938, two months after he invaded Austria and obtained the “Spear of Destiny”.  One of the cities he visited was Turin.  His henchmen began asking questions about the King’s Sacred Relic.  After just stealing the Spear of Destiny from the Hoffburg Museum in Vienna, no wonder the King was concerned.  Hitler invaded Poland on Sept 1, 1939.  Within two weeks the Shroud was secretly removed from Turin and brought to Rome for 18 days and then moved to Montevergine about 150 miles south of Rome in the hills near Avellino.  Why was the Shroud moved?  Until 2010 it was thought to keep it safe from Allied bombs but Italy did not enter the war until June of 1940 after Hitler invaded France.  So the real reason must have been to keep away from Hitler as new documents indicate.  In April of 1943, the Nazis came looking for the Shroud in Turin only to find out it was moved to a secret location.  At this time a press release was issued by the Vatican and carried by the NY Times that the Shroud had been moved to a safe location.  This announcement no doubt came after the Nazis came looking for it.  Did they find out where it was taken?  In Sept of 1943, the Nazis stormed the monastery under cover of darkness claiming they were looking for Allied spies.  The Abbot ordered all the monks to gather in the choir chapel where the Shroud had been secretly encased inside the Altar.  None of the monks knew it was there.  The Nazis searched room by room and when they came to the Choir Chapel and saw the monks gathered in prayer, one of the officers said, “Don’t bother the monks, let them pray.”  And so the soldiers left not finding any spies nor the Shroud.  Were they specifically looking for the Shroud?  No one really knows.  That is the story.  In my presentation I document Hitler’s obsession with the occult, how he coveted the Spear of Longinus, how he and Himmler were both obsessed with finding the Holy Grail and also the Shroud.  Unlike all the art works stolen as documented in the recent movie, Monuments Men, Hitler’s desire for religious artifacts stemmed from his belief they would give him supernatural power in his bid for world domination.  One last thing, in his twisted mind he had convinced himself that Jesus was of an Arian bloodline and was not a Jew–hence his obsession with finding things related to Christ.\n\n","date":"August 8, 2014 at 12:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/08/from-shroud-encounter-the-day-the-shroud-foiled-hitler/","cat":"history","title":"Revised: The Day the Shroud Foiled Hitler"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Thanks Dan, here is an example of what I might include.

Doesn’t seem like much, but the Shroud didn’t just get there in 1204.  It is most likely the same cloth that arrived in 944.  The point is simple.  The carbon date is wrong.  How wrong?  No one can say.  Does it prove it to be first century?  No. But it does prove the carbon date is wrong.

He is suggesting that pressure somehow resulted in a greater concentration of darkened fibers such as the tip of the nose.  Yet we already know that the image is NOT pressure sensitive since the image intensity is the same on the dorsal image which would have borne the full weight of the body…or in this instance, the alleged statue which was no doubt made out of metal to be an even conductor of heat.  Can you imagine the weight of that thing?  Have you picked up a bronze bust?  Kim Dreisbach had several in his collection. They are heavy…I can’t imagine the weight of a full bronze body.  I don’t think there is any doubt that heat would cause a pressure sensitive effect, even if placed on sand. The dorsal image would have a different density versus the frontal where the cloth was simply draped over the front of the supposed statue.

He alleges that in earlier centuries…before the paint flaked off, the loin cloth was more pronounced, which is why it is featured in nearly all copies or replicas.  However the Lier copy from 1516 barely shows any such loin cloth and the image is noticeably faint.  The Exhibition Poster from 1663 also shows the image very faint versus the darker images we find on other copies. Regarding the loin cloth, if there was any attempt to copy with realism what was seen on the original Shroud, why do all the loin cloths vary so much?  From 1579 it looks like a bath towel, others look like boxer shorts and yet others look like a stuffed diaper.  There is no consistency whatsoever regarding the presumed loin cloth.  Maybe that is because it never existed on the original and therefore invites artistic license!\n\n","date":"November 22, 2014 at 1:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/22/image-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Image of the Resurrection?"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Charles proposes that the Shroud was painted and the paint has now all flaked off.  One of his proof points is that copies or replicas of the cloth all show a much darker image than we see now.  Perhaps he is right. Or perhaps the image has grown more faint over time by natural means or perhaps there is a third option.  I lecture extensively on the Shroud.  When showing images of the Shroud, I often use the more contrast enhanced images from Enri–1931.  He used monochromatic film which enhances lights and darks.  Why would I do this?  SO THE AUDIENCE CAN SEE THE IMAGE!  Is it not likely that copies of the Shroud were made so people could see it?  Think of how the replica would have been displayed, in a dark church with no electric lighting.  Add to the problem of how one might paint something so faint in the first place.  Why not paint it so everyone can see it…even from the back of the church? (As a note:  Barrie’s pictures from 1978 are perfectly accurate in terms of color–but as a result the image is more faint.  Post 2002 restoration images are even harder to see because of a brighter backing cloth which has somehow effected the contrast.)\n\n","date":"November 22, 2014 at 11:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/22/image-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Image of the Resurrection?"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"What happened to Walter McCrone?

I will confess to being guilty as charged as one who holds to a “magical” explanation.  One of the reasons is that Rogers himself wasn’t convinced that the maillard reaction alone could explain the high resolution image we see especially of the face and hands. Second, it is hard to imagine that gas emitting from a decaying body could produce an image of identical intensity top to bottom and front to back.  Others who have experimented or explored this theory have also indicated that such emission of gases would be more pronounced around bodily orifices but this is not the case.  Rogers did not support any supernatural cause of the image yet he acknowledged that the lack of decomposition stains on the cloth supported the resurrection hypothesis.  Unless we assume that the body was stolen and the cloth left behind…or that Jesus woke up found Mary Magdalene and headed for the coast of France, then somehow and in some way the body literally disappeared.  There are too many verses of scripture that suggest light was involved.  So while current experiments with lasers don’t explain everything neither does gas emitting from a decaying body.  Perhaps the answer is not an all or none approach but a combination of causes.\n\n","date":"September 4, 2013 at 7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/09/04/thoughts-on-the-newly-published-paper-by-ray-rogers/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Thoughts on the newly published paper by Ray Rogers (REVISED)"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"I recall trading messages with Rogers on the SSG.

To think that gaseous emissions could have created such a uniform image is beyond reason.  Gas does not escape a decaying corpse in any uniform manner.  Thicker parts of the torso would exhibit more decay and therefore more gas emissions. Natural orifices in the body would offer the path of least resistance and should also show more gas emissions.  This is not seen on the Shroud. Vignon proposed gas and was dismissed early in Shroud research.  Why this is any different is beyond me.

I have always felt the message of the Shroud is past-present and future.  It is past because it speaks to the empty tomb, or more significantly, the vacant shroud which was the first piece of evidence that something extraordinary occurred.  It is present in that the Shroud uniquely displays the price that was paid for our salvation.  Scripture uses words like “ransom” that we were “bought” and that we were “purchased” and “redeemed”.  What was the price?  It is clearly displayed on the Shroud.  But it is also future and that enters the realm of the prophetic.  And why not, nearly one third of the bible is prophetic in nature.  How is the Shroud prophetic?  It speaks to a future event.  Jesus is called, “the firstfruits of the resurrection.” That implies that whatever happened to Jesus in the tomb is what will happen to all who believe at some point in the future.  This is what First Corinthians 15 talks about when Paul says, “Behold I show you a mystery, we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye.”  The amazing thing is that Paul is not talking about Jesus in this passage but about the ultimate resurrection of all who believe. There are many such prophecy conferences, this is the only one that has embraced the Shroud and I am glad they did.  I hope it opens new doors of discussion.  I think the Shroud should be included in paranormal conferences too!  Why not…if the Shroud is authentic, then it recorded the greatest paranormal event of all time.

It is not enough to simply claim the cloth is medieval without offering a credible process the alleged artist used to create this masterpiece.  We are clearly looking for an artist who predated Leonardo by several hundred years.  Charles Freeman has offered the most recent hypothesis but it too fails to explain why the blood penetrated the cloth whereas the paint did not, nor is it credible to assume that every speck of paint used to form the image has now disappeared.  Garlaschelli’s attempt was compelling but still does not replicate the fine gradient that correlates with body to cloth distance, nor does it account for no image being under the blood.  Contest this point all you want, this was a clear determination of STURP—you know, the scientists who had hands on access to the cloth for five days and nights.  I also get annoyed when the cloth’s obvious origin in Constantinople is conveniently ignored so as to allege the history only begins in the 1300’s.  This is irresponsible in view of the numerous documents both historical and visual that give strong evidence for the Shroud being stolen in 1204 by the French during the 4th Crusade.  Too many unanswered questions for the Shroud to be dismissed as a Medieval fake.\n\n","date":"April 23, 2015 at 7:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/the-real-meaning-is-not-authenticity/","cat":"2015","title":"The Real Meaning Is Not Authenticity"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"God help us.

It stands for Complexity, Order and Design.  All of life demonstrates these three primary attributes.

It is standard psychology that information that conflicts with our world view creates cognitive dissonance and must either be rejected (most likely) or accepted and integrated (less likely).  For those who hold strong opinions, conflicting information must be very persuasive to effect a change in that opinion.  We cannot tolerate being in a state of confusion so we form opinions that integrates information in accordance with our world view and rejects everything else.  The white lab coat of pure objectivity is an illusion.  Everyone has a bias and no one has all the information available on a given topic. This is exactly why the legal system of prosecutor and defense with 12 jurors is so important.  Not only will both lawyers present radically different views of the facts it is now up to 12 individuals to come to a reasoned consensus.  Each juror heard something different from the testimony of witnesses and evidence presented by both sides.  It is the closest we will ever get to the truth–and even then they get it wrong from time to time.  I have often said that when it comes to the Shroud, we cannot get to a verdict that is “beyond a reasonable doubt” as in a criminal trial.

Enter Thomas de Wesselow, Postdoctoral Research Associate at Cambridge University, studied art history at Edinburgh University and was a research scholar at the British School in Rome—seems to have all the academic credentials one would need to have a legitimate dog in the fight. \nHere is the take away quote from his book, The Sign (2012):  “Accepting the carbon-date (as true), art historians should have leaped on the Shroud as on of the most fascinating visual creations of the medieval period, a true masterpiece of devotional imagery.  Strangely though, they have remained almost entirely silent. The reason is simple: the negative photo of the cloth is an unmistakable sign that the Shroud’s famous image could not have been created by a medieval artist. Technically, conceptually and stylistically the Shroud makes no sense as a medieval artwork. The field of art history has had over a century to study the Shroud since it was first photographed.  And in all that time no art historian has ever ventured to attribute it to a medieval artist.”  End quote.\nSo I guess kudos are in order for Charles Freeman in that he has gone where no art historian has yet to venture–however he has yet to address de Wesselow’s key assertion that “technically, conceptually, and stylistically the Shroud makes no sense as a medieval artwork.”  As a personal comment, It does seem rather bizarre that the Shroud is a perfect negative which means the reverse positive image we see through photography would have been a complete accident–totally unknown to the alleged artist who crafted the image.

I will be in heaven with the angels before that happens. The middle path is this:  Can we use the Shroud for its phenomenal witness for Christ even though we don’t have absolute proof of authenticity?  And the answer is a resounding YES as long as we recognize the message is what matters.  Either the Shroud is the authentic burial cloth of Christ or it represents the biblical truths upon which it is based.  I always say, “Explore the Mystery–Encounter the Message”.  The message remains the same regardless of authenticity.  Do I think it is authentic?  Yes.  Do I hope it is authentic?  Yes.  Can I prove it absolutely?  No.  Can I still use it effectively as a unique way of telling the “Greatest story ever told”?  Absolutely!

Gesso? I guess not!  \n“Gesso”, also known “glue gesso” or “Italian gesso”[2] is a traditional mix of an animal glue binder (usually rabbit-skin glue), chalk, and white pigment, used to coat rigid surfaces such as wooden painting panels as an absorbent primer coat substrate for painting. The colour of gesso was usually white or off-white. Its absorbency makes it work with all painting media, including water-based media, different types of tempera, and oil paint. It is also used as a base on three-dimensional surfaces for the application of paint or gold leaf.[3] Mixing and applying it is an art form in itself since it is usually applied in 10 or more extremely thin layers. It is a permanent and brilliant white substrate used on wood, masonite and other surfaces. The standard hide glue mixture is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking, thus making it suitable for rigid surfaces only. For priming flexible canvas, an emulsion of gesso and linseed oil, also called “half-chalk ground”, is used.[4] In geology, the Italian “gesso” corresponds to the English “gypsum”, as it is a calcium sulfate mineral (CaSO4·2H2O). \nFunny how no binder was found on the Shroud, no evidence of animal protein, and it is certainly not a rigid surface.

So why in the world would a Gnostic artist create a burial shroud with the image of a crucified man when that only seems to confirm that Jesus did indeed come in the flesh.  I further believe that early iconographic representations of Jesus whether independent or based on the Shroud itself such as the Sinai Icon, were meant to be clear statements that Jesus did indeed come in the flesh…and here is a picture.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2014 at 9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/08/russ-breault-and-pastor-caspar-mccloud-discuss-the-shroud/","cat":"video","title":"Russ Breault and Pastor Caspar McCloud Discuss the Shroud"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"They interviewed me for the Shroud segment but I have no idea how this is going to come out.

Who can really understand the incarnation–much less the resurrection?  How does someone calm a storm with a command?  How does someone feed five thousand with a boy’s lunch?  All of these are mysteries beyond our human understanding. If the Shroud was an obvious work of art–we would have figured that out years ago.  So it stands to reason that the Shroud, if authentic, would defy explanation despite thousands of hours of scientific analysis.  In my view, one of the strongest arguments for the Shroud’s authenticity is that it remains a mystery.\n\n","date":"July 17, 2013 at 10:02 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/07/16/the-investigator-new-film-about-the-death-and-resurrection-of-christ/","cat":"movie","title":"The Investigator:  New Film About the Death and Resurrection of Christ"},{"author":"russ_breault","post":"Dave, I agree with you.
