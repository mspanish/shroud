It’s hard to claim it is a forgery,when today’s technology can’t duplicate it.\nThe argument I have against it are two fold. One being that it would seem that the shroud would have covered Christ quite a while after he expired. You would think the resurection would have occured instantly at his death on the cross.\nMy other argument is if Christians believe all saved Christians are resurected to heaven, than why aren’t there millions of similiar shrouds around?\n\n","date":"January 1, 2013 at 9:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/03/so-what-is-controversial/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So what is controversial?"}]}
