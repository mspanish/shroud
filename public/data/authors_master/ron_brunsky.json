The Shroud of Turin, despite the scientific analysis, remains one of the strongest arguments for Christ’s resurection. It’s hard to claim it is a forgery,when today’s technology can’t duplicate it. The argument I have against it are two fold. One being that it would seem that the shroud would have covered Christ quite a while after he expired. You would think the resurection would have occured instantly at his death on the cross. My other argument is if Christians believe all saved Christians are resurected to heaven, than why aren’t there millions of similiar shrouds around?.","date":"2013-01-01","mins":"9:01 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/03/so-what-is-controversial/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"So what is controversial?"}]}
