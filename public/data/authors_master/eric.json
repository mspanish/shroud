I state numerous times that the flash blindness scenario is speculation, a tought exercise. I do not believe in it, and I most certainly do not want anybody to believe it either, that is not the idea. The point of the exercise was to help illustrate just how far someone could take a single reference, mix it up with supporting sources, create a fringe hypothesis and debate it coherently. The fact that you keep gravitating towards it and trying to put me on the defensive actually proves that you are aware that the only thing supporting the “instant baldness” is your association of an image (the way gardeners looked) with an account that does not go into further detail in order to explain why that happened. The irony of the issue is that you claim that I take the bible “to literally”, yet you have created a medically unsound hypothesis based on an event depicted only by John. You know that gospel has several contrasts with the synoptic gospels; some even suggest that John 21 implies that it was written from a second hand account. So, maybe you are placing all of your eggs in a single basket. I would not let my interpretation of the other congruent gospels waver due to it and would most certainly not risk my reputation like you are. BTW, I am not arguing about the way that Temple gardeners dressed… I am arguing that you believe that for someone to mistake somebody else that person must look *exactly* the same way. And finally, I think that if you wanted somebody to take this idea seriously, you should have contacted somebody qualified to provide an expert’s assessment. Your hypothesis fails on medical grounds and hence, it is not a “serious argument”. I know that you know this, but you clearly dislike criticsm of your ideas. Maybe that is why you have so many “unpublished” papers? You don’t like peer reviews? Only you can answer that.

IMO, postpartum alopecia is a bad analogy for your point. It is usually notable between the 2 4 month mark and thus shares the same problem that I mentioned with “regular” telogen effluvium: It seems “sudden”, but it is actually a process that only becomes notable some time after it’s genesis. Neither of these are apparent within hours, such as would have been the case in the example of Jesus/MM. Most of the those cases are related to severe illnesses that carry other visible symptoms, all of which would have been noted by the disciples.

Severe trauma also carries other complications, including endocrine ones, that contribute to hair loss, but alas, in a systemic way.

Just like you and everybody else, the only thing that I can do to explain the gospel is to speculate.

Daniel 10:6 supports this. All of this suggests that they were extraordinarily luminous, blindingly so. There is not way to misidentify and angel with something earthly, thus why she easily recognized the angel. So then.. Why didn’t she know her own teacher? My guess would be that her eyes were still adjusting to the shade following the encounter with the angel. And when Jesus appeared she was still unable to clearly discern his features, which combined with the clothing, could explain the confusion. After all, the duration of flash blindness has been associated with the intensity of the light source. Other options may be that he was standing in an angle where his face may have been obscured or was maybe wearing something that cloaked his face (if he was found alive, I guess that he may have been considered a fugitive; although I am not personally by this one) or that MM, completely shocked by the absence of a body dismissed the angel as a grief induced hallucination and tried to rationalize his presence by identifying him as someone that she would expect: a gardener..","date":"2014-10-18","mins":"7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Thanks All Around"},{"id":"comment-163246","author":"eric","post":"And again, I believe that we should rule out alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis due to the fact that the change would be extreme.

And I was quite clear that it was speculation, which I decided to elaborate on your request while we were discussing what I can actually debate, the pathology of trauma related hairloss and the speed of its onset. But since you insist… MPH: “Eric, relying mostly and too much methinks on Daniel’s (Daniel 10:5 6) vivid description of an angel: “I looked up and there before me was A MAN DRESSED IN LINEN (my upper cases), with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist. His body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude”” A: I’m not exactly sure why you are emphasizing the clothing, when the obvious characteristics that would support a luminous being are his description of the face and eyes, which are associated with lightning and fire. Daniel provides a fancy, yet detailed description of an angel, and implies that it was luminous. Matthew 28:3 provides a very similar description of the very being that appeared to the guards and women: “His appearance (face in some translations) was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.” Implying that both were allegorizing the “lightning” part is a worst defiance to logic than taking it to literally mean that angels emit an intense luminosity akin to lightning. MPH: “(…) you wrote (re the angels at and in Yeshu’a’s tomb: “They were extraordinarily luminous, blindingly so” and Mary was so much bedazzled she just could not even recognize her own master AND YET mistook him for the gardener implying she could not mistook him for any of Yeshua’s disciples who might have come over as well to the tomb (besides John and Peter). You explanation neither fits logic and John’s gospel narrative.” A: I did not say “bedazzled”, which implies disorientation and impairment of several senses. No, I said that she would have been experiencing “flash blindness” of the kind that people adjusting to a sudden change in lighting experience. The effect can last several days, and no, in most cases it does not mean that the person is entirely blind but rather just visually impaired. Why not mistake him for an apostle? The clothing. I already noted my agreement on this point. MPH: “When Mary Magdalene saw Yeshu’a on that early morning, most likely she was sitting on her knees still weeping at the low cave tomb opening and looking in. She turned her head as Yeshu’a’s body draped in a sindon was silhouetted against the rising sun between two columns with two more pillars projecting from either side of the monumental/main entrance. She could have mistaken him for a divine messenger too according to ‘your speculation’, which is definitely not the case: she mistook him for a gardener implying ‘the man she saw’ looked an everyday man weaing a red earth stained sindon draped as workwear and his face was hairless (if not to say bald or nearly bald).” A: Again, I agree on the clothing. Not the baldness. My speculation does not say or imply that she would mistake somebody wearing that, with the divine messenger that the women had seen and who is described as wearing clothing that was “white as snow” (Matt. 28:3). MPH: “Besides the word for angels can refer here either to divine messengers or mere human messengers (e.g. Yeshu’a’s secret disciples from Essenean background) or else divine messengers resembling human form.” A: Are you completely ignoring Matthew 28:3? Just like Daniel’s, this angel had an appearance (or face, depending on the translation) “like lightning”. Clearly not adopting an human facade. Furthermore, he made his supernatural nature very obvious when he appeared following a quake, moved the heavy stone by himself and sat on it. No one present would mistake it for a human, ever. MPH: “Indeed if in in Heb. 1:14, we are told angels are not composed of physical matter but are spirit beings created by G od; the true fact remains angels can resemble human form when G od permits or wills it (see Gen. 19) and when they appear in a human form in the Bible, they are always a man even if angels are neither male of female and they appear as such NOT TO FRIGHTEN real human beings, which is in drastic contrast with ‘your speculation’. Reminder the angel’s word in the tomb: “Don’t be afraid!”.” A: Max, you are contradicting both the physical description given in Matthew 28:3 and the fact that Matthew 28:4 states that the guards were horribly scared: “The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.” Clearly the reason why he had to say “Do not be afraid” to the women was due to his supernatural appearance and actions, both of which would have been fiercely intimidating. “Thus what do you make of the fact Second Temple period gardeners’ face was hairless? NOTHING!” A: Of course not, you requested me to bring up an alternative answer to the baldness issue and I did. “What do you make of the fact the resurrected/glorified Christ Late Antique and Medieval iconography depicts him with no hair and no moustache at times while depicting him with a beard and moustache before resurrection and glorification ON THE SAME iconographic program (see e.g. The famous Hungarian Pray Ms bifolium)? NOTHING!” A: You of all people should be aware of the identifications with pagan deities and the influence that could have on the way that people that never saw him visualized him. Just take Sol Invictus’ classical appearance, remember the Mausoleum M depiction of Christ as a fusion of himself and the pagan deity, Dies Natalis Solis Invicti and Christmas… And voila, a perfect recipe for people depicting Jesus the as the clean shaven Sol Invictus during those early centuries. The human Jesus would be depicted as your “average” Jewish man, while the Resurrected form would resemble the “divine” look of Sol Invictus. The example of Sol Invictus is the most obvious due to the known interaction between his cult and early Christianity, but the same could be said for Apollo and several of the Hellenistic/Roman deities. “This is not serious refutation.” A: It was meant to be speculation, I went on the tangent on your request.

Not only that, but simply a glimpse of such an extreme form of light would suffice (Did you know that temporary blindness is seen commonly in those adjacent to actual lightning strikes, even when they never “saw” the actual bolt? Also, abolt only lasts a few milliseconds.) and we know that Daniel was able to see him and did not fall until spoken to. Also, Ezekiel 1:28 states that he was permitted a glimpse of The Lord himself before falling down. In any case, I don’t think that she would have continued to look at it for long, just enough to identify it as an angel (a glimpse of the divine). Lastly, even if the angel was disguised, it is still highly likely that she would have fallen to the floor in reverence as soon as she realized who he was and would have been instructed to stand up, so it would still play out the same way. Um, No. The rising sun hardly illuminates to the extent that the eyes would not need to adjust if suddenly faced with something that irradiated “like lightning”. Lightning is several times more radiant than the actual sun, and hotter as well. Lightning may cause instantaneous damage to the retina, which is something that the sun will take its sweet time to do. If you were struck by a freak bolt in the middle of the day with the sun shining at its max, you would still experience flash blinding. Finally, I don’t think that the need to explain atmospheric scattering is relevant here, but there is a *reason* why we can enjoy sunrise and sunset. MPH: “2/ Re Matt 28: 1 4 we read: “Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 4 And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. – firstly you most misleadingly mix up THREE DIFFERENT EPISODES as Matthew (for dramatic emphasis’ sake) mixes two episodes into one namely the resurrection per se that occurred in the middle of the night (AND NOT at dawn!) with an angel descending from heaven (that is from outside the tomb AND NOT from the inside!) and Mary Magdalene coming at the tomb toward dawn first WITH OTHER WOMEN AND THEN with Mary Magdalene’s RETURN to the empty tomb by herself and seeing an angel IN the tomb.” A: First, I did not “mix up” anything, these are different scenes of the same sequence and thus relevant to each other. The difference is only a few hours, Max. Second, there is no reason to assume that this was not the same being, since the women left, it would be most ineffective to return and then come back without delivering his message (and complete his divine mission). Simply remaining in the vicinity was more likely. Third, as explained above, the time of the day would make no difference in regards to flash blindness, as explained in the reply above. MPH: “Besides ‘the Archangel of Lightning’ as Anthropomorphic Personification trope was currently used in popular ancient Jewish culture for literary dramatic emphasis. To mistake literary device for fact is just naive.” A: “Currently” as in “first century current” is completely besides the point, since the description matches that of Daniel ages before. Allegorizing that may be a mistake on your behalf, especially since we are simply told that this was a messenger and is not identified as somebody higher up in hierarchy like say, Michael (who may warrant a “trope”). MPH: “(…) thirdly, shall I endlessly repeat, in the Bible and Rabbinic literature, angels are spiritual beings without bodies of flesh and bones THOUGH they apparently have the ability to appear in human form (Gen. 19:1 22). Reminder: physical Matter is the lowest vibration of spiritual Energy (or Spirit) and spiritual Energy (or Spirit) is the highest vibration of physical Matter” A: Perhaps you could clarify this argument, because I am sure that this was addressed in my last reply. And not only that, I used the term “human facade” well aware that they are not made out of flesh and blood. The fact of the matter is that the only description of the being adjacent to the tomb near the time of the Resurrection is describing a supernatural appearance. MPH: “3/ you wrote: “it is unlikely that he (=Yeshu’a) would have experienced extreme hairloss in a couple of days especially localized hair loss and that diffuse hair loss is not enough to make somebody a “complete stranger”.” A: Now this I can debate! MPH: “Question one: when was it last you medically studied or hear of a moustached, bearded and long haird man returned to life/resurrected after experiencing a very traumatic/violent death to totally rule out the possibility of a case of ‘post oppressaem et ad vitam reditum’ quick extreme alopecia (loss of beard and moustache and partial loss of Yeshu’a’s long hair blood encrusted hair)?” A: I already answered that no body has ever attended or studied any case of actual resurrection. However, let’s assume that it was so. Did you know that a good portion of your hair is already ready to fall? This is called the telogen phase and throughout it this hair is essentially just resting there, it could fall out at any moment, yet it generally does when the cycle is either ready to restart and go back to the anagen (growth) phase or when it is interrupted, as you are implying. Well now, when trauma interrupts the cycle and sends most of the hairs into a premature telogen phase, this means that these hairs are left without “replacements” and hair loss becomes apparent. However, the problem with that is as mentioned above that regardless of the reason for the interruption of the cycle (and death followed by Resurrection would be just that, a prolonged interruption of all body functions) said hair loss is systematic and will not become apparent until *at least* a few days after. You are suggesting that the sheer trauma would accelerate this to a few hours, but can’t provide any example of this happening either. MPH: “Had you ever gotten long hair and worn a moustache and beard and one day had to have all your hair shaved on the head and all around the mouth in a place with no mirror and all of a sudden, while passing from a place with no mirror to a place with a mirror, been brought face to face with your own new reflection in the mirror, you could have not even recognized yourself at first sight and should have needed a time to adapt and become familiar with your new face image! Even a very good friend from childhood could not have recognized you unless you would have addressed him using his surname. Once I made this very disturbing experiment. I could not even recognize a very good friend of mine from childhood just standing in front me as he had no moustache no beard any longer and wear very short hair, which I was not familiar with!” A: Well, of course. Had he actually *shaved* his face/head clean this could be easily explained. But this was one of the very first things that I addressed. Culturally this was unlikely, to this day the Halakha addresses shaving in a particular manner. Then there is the Nazarite Vow, but also the drinking of wine to consider. MPH: “Most likely, this could explain why Mary Magdalene was unable to recognize her own master as she mistook him for a hairless faced, sparse haired and red earth encrusted bare footed gardener draped in his red earthstained sindon used as workwear.” A: … MPH: “You also wrote: “You of all people should be aware of the identifications with pagan deities and the influence that could have on the way that people that never saw him visualized him.” In the specific case of the Hungarian Pray Ms bifolium I gave as an example, most likely the illustrator did SEE the crucifixion victim image on the Constantinople Sindon. Still it is reported by eyewitnesses “the ‘not made by hand’ image of Christ and G od, draped with a white/pure linen cloth he had worn, was sufficiently in lieu of the vision of the Lord coming into the flesh to those who had not corporally seen him”. Too bad you of all people are amazingly unaware of the corroborating 944 1207 CE testimonies and eyewitness descriptions of the TS image.” A: Not at all, I am well aware of the parallels to the shroud in the Codex since it has been discussed here time after time. I never denied that the author saw the shroud, as a matter of fact I assume that he did. What *I did* imply is that the reason why his hair would be depicted differently afterwards is because the author would feel the need to illustrate the divinity of the Resurrection by replacing the bearded, “traditional” Jewish man, depicted in the shroud with something that reflected a known pagan deity as a metaphor of ascension, from man to God. Pagan influence lingered way after the cults disappeared, the author of the codex should have been well aware of these earlier depictions and hence why he choose them to illustrate this metaphor. Regardless, in either case a few things are certain: I No first century artist is known to have painted an image of Christ after seeing him Resurrected first hand. This entire debate would be settled if such a piece emerged. II No oral tradition has been recorded directly stating that the change involved Jesus’ hair. III There is no way that the Codex’s author saw the Resurrected Christ in person and if he actually saw the shroud, then that would actually put more weight on the theory that the variation in the depictions was either metaphorical or represented something that is not to be taken literally. MPH: “Your refutation is still not serious and does not fit with the Gospels, the known (in terms of facts of experience) and the most comprehensive and logical explanation for Mary Magdalene mistaking her own master for the gardener.” A: Has it occurred to you that maybe we just have different interpretations of the gospels? So far I have not found any trouble rebuffing your arguments back, if mine were so flawed it would not have been this easy. And again, your own comprehensive explanation is still speculative, just like mine..","date":"2014-10-20","mins":"8:03 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/15/thanks-all-around/","cat":"st_louis_2014","title":"Thanks All Around"},{"id":"comment-165386","author":"eric","post":"Well then, let’s go back to the medical matters… Can you cite me some literature backing down your point about notable hair loss that takes place in a couple of hours following severe trauma?

Is that your way of saying that the ‘quick microwave’ alopecia is undocumented? If so, how does it differentiate itself from run of the mill speculation? Besides being “obvious” and “logical” in the opinion of an individual? The scarcity of cases has never been an obstacle to at the very least make a footnote in medical literature. There are several diseases that are on record as affecting less than a dozen individuals. So, if someone lost his/hers hair in a few hours following extreme trauma, it is out there. Since the Resurrection basically brought all of the cells to their previous function (this is actually the first time that I have encountered thought of an “imperfect/incomplete” Resurrection), there is no reason to believe that they would behave in odd ways. Except, of course, someone is speculating. The shorud depicts a man with full hair, so if it is real, that is a problem for your theory. You are assuming that it is real, but depending on third party depictions made by individuals that were never in contact with the Resurrected Jesus. Even if it actually happened, we have no idea of proving or disproving it, since nobody made any direct references to his post Resurrection follicular proficiency, you cling to a single account to create this extraordinary house of cards. Colin would call this non falsifiable idea something like “pseudo medicine”, so maybe you should consider yourself lucky that I refrain from calling it a fairytale and instead prefer the more subtle “speculation”. The only difference between my “fairy tale” and yours is that I readily admit that it is nothing more that speculation, nothing more than a thought exercise, while you claim that yours is the truth based on something as subjective as it appearing to be “logical”.

Several of these are already addressed in long and winded comments above and I grow tired of your rethoric. The age of the Third book of Enoch, which is the most prominent work depicting Barachiel, has been heavily debated as Evans notes. Just like everybody here, I am aware of the fact that the face in the shroud is covered in blood, but that is a moot point, I have yet to see anyone losing most of his/her hair due to tug and pulling… And that includes all kinds of blood, you name it and we have it. Don’t you know that in most cases, the only part that is actually cleaned while attending a patient is the wound and its adjacent areas? In some cases, the other blood remains there for several hours until the patient is stabilized and the remaining blood can be washed. The tug and pull can remove *some* hair, yet no extreme form of alopecia occurs, you don’t even need to contact an M.D. To tell you this, an experienced R.N. Has plenty of experience dealing with such messes. What I do believe is that you have never worked with a trauma survivor. You concepts on alopecia are simply erroneous.

Nevertheless wasting time debating speculation, either mine or yours is pointless and I admit that it was my fault going on a tangent on your request.

The fact that you insist on discussing your unique interpretation of the gospel proves to me that you know that there is no literature to back up those claims.

With that said, claiming that *all* science dealing with the shroud is pseudo science is ridiculous, we have people here that are actually testing the different ideas that emerge, others examining the properties of the cloth… Not every one of the shroudies is “out there” in the fringe and by minimizing those that are not, you are also mocking the work of the skeptics that post here. Since it is so “obvious”, then they are surely wasting their time, right? And boy, are they mediocre if they can copy something that is so *obviously* a fake! No, it may very well be fake, but it is one interesting and rather complex fake. Trying to understand its properties is not any more pseudo scientific that studying the subtleties of a lost artist by studying his work. In other words, try to avoid the Coyne mistake of being ever so pretentious and at least try to test the waters first..","date":"2014-10-30","mins":"10:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/18/quote-for-today-on-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud/","cat":"quotations","title":"Quote for Today on Carbon Dating of the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-167025","author":"eric","post":"* if they CAN’T copy.","date":"2014-10-30","mins":"10:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/18/quote-for-today-on-carbon-dating-of-the-shroud/","cat":"quotations","title":"Quote for Today on Carbon Dating of the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-167775","author":"eric","post":"There we go.

Because she was introduced properly and took the time to make an attempt at a paper that backs up her claims. She did not come out of the blue and posted some bold assertions in a forum. Which was my point. The fact that she was completely out of her element did not prevent her work from being discussed (Charles is way out of his by placing all of his work on top of the “gesso” argument. His conclusion was reached without any scientist’s help, and he is as bold as to claim that this work overcomes real scientists based on logic… Yet it is still being seriously discussed) while other works such as the “lirey toga” fiasco of last week passed pretty much undiscussed. The degree, as unrelated as it is, allows some people to gravitate towards her and support her work… And the other camp to respond. And thus, the discussion follows. Not that I find the logic of your question, since she is not really a key component of any serious debate and I sure wasn’t defending her.
