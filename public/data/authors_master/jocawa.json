{"researchers":[{"author":"jocawa","post":"\n\nI have read Wilson's book on Nostradamus. He admits it was written to a deadline and not as complete as he would have liked but I was struck by his balanced approach, using only accurate historical evidence, concluding Nostradamus was a fake. Very far from junk history. I recently read his 1998 book the Blood and the Shroud, having read his 1978 book about thirty years ago. I was again struck by his balance, his generous treatment of those who believed it to be a medieval forgery. All in all a disgraceful article but not untypical nowadays. I must read his latest.\n\n","date":"June 26, 2010 at 5:59 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2010/04/ian-wilsons-turin-shroud-theories-are.html","title":"\n`Ian Wilson's Turin Shroud theories are the worst kind of junk history'\n"}]}
