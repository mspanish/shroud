We cannot know what happens specifically at death until we’re there and to catch a glimpse from you that have tasted it is amazing to say the least.  Thank you for sharing your stories, you give me hope and peace.\n\n","date":"July 30, 2012 at 11:31 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
