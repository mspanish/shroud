Here are my answers: @Mike M: The stone Mandylion of the Breton calvary has really the epsilon blood stain on the forehead as we can see on the Turin Shroud. Yes, it is a highly suggestive proof that the Mandylion could be the Shroud folded in 8. @David Bowman: Nowadays, the mark epsilon (E) is practically indiscernible on the stone Mandylion. I have underscored it by transfering to a tracing paper. Please see the result on the first image in page 6 of my report: http://www.cirac.org/Mandylion.pdf @daveb of wellington: The “3” sign on the forehead is the result of the TS photography. An “epsilon” and not a “3” sign is present on the stone Mandylion of the Breton Calvary. Consequently we can assert the sculptor has really seen a Shroud face with this typical sign when he has sculpted this stone Mandylion. He has sculpted this Shroud face in a landscaped frame probably because his model was presented in an unusual « landscaped » portrait surrounded by a thick and solid framework similar to the « Face of Edessa » or Mandylion. @Max Patrick Hamon: The Breton calvary in the Red Cross Field (“Park ar Groaz ru”) is supposed to be of templar origin because first there is a part of a templar building (Chamber of Red Monks) closely near the calvary and secondly because the date of erection found on the calvary pedestal seems to be 1304 as explained on my report. This date was deciphered by photography and mainly by transfer to a tracing paper (copy available on demand). But, as you say, we can also supposed that it is a stone copy of a much older stone template dating back to the Knights !Templar ! In fact we have no formal proof..","date":"2014-09-18","mins":"12:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/15/new-book-the-tem-plar-mandylion/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: The Templar Mandylion"},{"id":"comment-152677","author":"francois_gazay","post":"Please note my name is François Gazay and not your miswriting François Gaszay..","date":"2014-09-20","mins":"8:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/15/new-book-the-tem-plar-mandylion/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: The Templar Mandylion"},{"id":"comment-152688","author":"francois_gazay","post":"Have you visited this calvary?
