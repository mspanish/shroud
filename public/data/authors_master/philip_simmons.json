{"misc":[{"id":"comment-1269","author":"philip_simmons","post":"In Matthew Mark and Luke there is no mention of burial clothes at the discovery of the empty tomb. In John it is noted that that the face cloth was folded and strips of fabric lay on the ground. The Shroud itself therefore is absent from all four gospels. The only logical conclusion is that it remained with the body after it was removed from the tomb of Joseph of Aramathea and placed elsewhere. The very existence of the shroud presents a problem for the ressurrection theory. Had it been there the empty Shroud with the first ever photograhic negative imprinted on it would have been much more complelling evidence of ressurrection than an empty tomb..","date":"2010-04-24","mins":"2:10 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/11/23/late-breaking-website-news/","cat":"2010","title":"Late Breaking Website News!"}]}
