Did they come by Camels? or Did they come by some sort of Horse cart? No one knows definite answers to those question. Same way no one know how that linen cloth came to Jeruselem. Joseph of Arimathea must have paid paid a lot of money to buy that linen cloth. It must be very special one for him. He may have already bought that thing for his burial as he already had a newly constructed tomb. So he may have used that linen cloth to cover the body of Jesus as a respect. For me there is no doubt that the linen cloth came from Idia as confirm by DNA. Another thought is that when they covered the body of Jesus that linen cloth may very wet due to heavy rain at that time.

Some believe that every living cell produce some sort of Bio Field (very faint electrical field). After the death this field vanishes due to extinguish of blood circulation. Recent research detected very weak electrical fields around the living things including plants. To my knowledge no one has resurrected from death except Jesus. So no one knows exactly what sorts of mechanisms are involved in this resurrection process. Furthermore no one knows, exactly, how much energy is required to start the blood re circulation after 3 days of death. If Jesus resurrected from death and his blood circulation started again, then at the inception of that blood circulation, there is a high probability that some sort of electrical field generated. No one knows how strong that electrical field is? This could have been the reason to print the image on the burial cloth of Jesus. Although not related, I want to mention the following: After reading Gospels I have realised that Jesus was a unique human being born to this world. He preached about the kingdom of God and also attacked the religion of Jews at that time. He used parables to explain the Kingdom of God and told that Kingdom of God is for everyone and not only for the Jews. That was the one of the reason reasons Jewish religious leaders killed him. According to Gospels Jesus did many miracles such as healing sick, casting out evils, walking on water, calming storms and feeding more than 5000 people from few fish and bread. Furthermore he raised 3 people from the dead and most famous one was raising Lazarus from the death. Unfortunately Lazarus did not have a burial cloth like Jesus. If he had a burial cloth like Jesus then his body image also would have got printed on that burial cloth. Before his death Jesus predicted that Jews will kill him and but he will resurrect on the third day from the death. According to gospels there are witnesses for his resurrection and also to the burial cloth..","date":"2014-12-17","mins":"6:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/12/17/a-gedankened-image-forming-process/","cat":"image_theory","title":"A Gedankened Image Forming Process"},{"id":"comment-177411","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Louis— What happened between the two events?

They can appear and also they can disappear. Angels also can sing, talk and carry things. Jesus never told that his resurrected body is same as the body he had prior to his death. Furthermore after the resurrection Jesus appeared and disappeared like Angels. Even Mary Magdalene and another two disciples couldn’t recognize resurrected Jesus. Mary recognized him from his voice but the other two disciples couldn’t recognize Jesus even hearing the voice of resurrected Jesus. Furthermore Jesus asked Mary not to touch his resurrected body as he has no being to the Father. Most probably, after being to the Father, resurrected Jesus ate. Jesus also has wounded scour marks on his resurrected body (Jesus asked Thomas to touch those) similar to the image on the TS. But resurrected body of Jesus is quite different to the body Jesus had prior to his death. As I mentioned previously no one knows about the resurrection process. If we assume Jesus resurrected bodily then we have to consider external energy sources (ie. Earth quakes) to form the body image on the shroud. If assume Jesus resurrected like an angel then we can consider internally generated energy sources (ie. Radiation, X Ray) to form the body image on the TS. As Gospel accounts supports both the bodily resurrection and resurrection with a body like Angels then we can consider both external (to body) and internal (from the body) energy sources to form the image. But based on the properties/aspects of the image on TS most probably an internal energy source is the reason to form an image on the TS..","date":"2015-05-20","mins":"9:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/19/guest-posting-the-shroud-of-turin-an-x-ray/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Guest Posting:  The Shroud of Turin – An X-Ray?"},{"id":"comment-199578","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Thank you Dan for this posting.

Any chemical, biological or natural reaction of a dead or living body cannot make an image like that. I am quite sure that none of the biological or chemical processes can create an image like on the TS with the hair, beard and eyebrows. Dr. Accetta’s experiment confirmed that image was created by some sort of radiation. As confirmed by many scientists blood stains are real and blood soaked to the linen before the creation of the body. Most probably body dematerialized and some sort of radiation activity emerged within the body to create dorsal and frontal images and linen acted like a (photographic or X ray film).

My opinion about Holy Bible is quite different. I think Holy Bible was given to Christians by Constantine as a political solution to satisfy various Christian groups existed at that time. As an example, to satisfy Jewish Christians compilers included Old Testament, although Moses plagiarised the Creation story, the Flood story and also the Ten Commandments from other nations. Also to satisfy Pauline Christians they included Epistles of Paul. Surprisingly those who compiled the Bible did not use any records of majority of other Apostles. They did not include anything about Thomas especially what he did in India and neighbouring countries of India. In addition they burnt many books inherited by other Christian groups. Jesus never mentioned anything about the creation story and/or the great flood. Only thing Jesus mentioned from the creation story is that at the beginning Father made man and woman and when they united they become one. Also Jesus told that no one knows the end but only the Father. Most of the Epistles written by Paul contradict the new commandment of Jesus and the two Great Commandments mentioned by Jesus. So as a follower of Jesus either Old Testament or Epistles give me no help to understand the Kingdom of God. (or the Kingdom of Love). Only four Gospels tell about the Kingdom of God and how can we enter into it. As a follower of Jesus (not as a Christian or fundamentalist Christian) I believe all stories of Jesus from 4 Gospels. I have to believe those stories because I believe that Jesus really resurrected from death. Although there are many sceptics, my wisdom always tells me that Shroud of Turin is authentic. So the Shroud of Turin is the main and first Gospel for me. From 1st April 2010, the day I was introduced to the Shroud, I believe that Jesus really existed, died on the cross and resurrected.

But John did not write that they took the burial clothes with them. Why? Most probably they did not want to steal the clothes which were belonging to Joseph of Arimathea. During the last 3 months 3 reformed Christians (born again) condemned the Shroud of Turin because it is an image. They did so because they believe that Scriptures (Bible) are inspired by God. So is this the same reason Gospel writers did not want to mention the image on the burial cloth of Jesus? They may have thought their eye witness record (of resurrection) is more important than the image on the burial cloth. However according to Gospel of Hebrews Jesus gave the Linen Cloth to the Servant of Priest. Who is this servant? Most probably this servant is one of the other disciples not mentioned in the canonical Gospels (after Jesus death). Four canonical gospels are not giving any information about the other disciples after the death of Jesus. We can read only about Peter, John and Thomas before the ascension. There some names in John 21:1 3. We can’t read anything about Thomas who preached in India. Gospel of Hebrews was written in middle of the second century and the writer of this Gospel knew about the linen cloth.

That is why Jesus came to this world to take lost angels back to the kingdom of God. Jesus main message was “Love”. Look at the Shroud. You can see that Love there.

Before giving my answer I must thank to Dan for this valuable and unique site on Shroud of Turin. I was exposed to Shroud on 1 April 2010 and after that I gave my leisure time to do research on Shroud and this Dan’s site helped me to learn almost all about the Shroud. It is nice and good experience to listen to all sort of people and absorb many positive as well as negative things about the Shroud. Mr. Farey, the blood on hair is the Trade Mark of Authenticity of the Shroud. It tells that image on Shroud is not a painting as well as not a contact process. Furthermore Blood on Hair tell us that image was formed due to some form of Radiation. This Blood on Hair confirmed that it is not a work of a forger. Resurrection is a unique incident in Human history. No one ever resurrected from the death after three days. So my imagination is that at Resurrection Jesus body got dematerialized and radiation emitted from the body including Hair. That is why we can see blood on Hair on the image. Scientific research on Shroud tells us that the body which was caused the image on Shroud never got deteriorated. Furthermore STURP research tells us that blood came first before the formation of image. Dr. Lavoie’s observation also confirmed that blood on cheeks came first before the formation of image. OK is 90% correct to say that image was formed by shortest distance due to some sort of emission of waves from the body. Dr. Lavoie is also 1 5% correct shroud was flat and vertical projection was the mechanism. Now I give the possible missing link (say 5% accuracy) Mr. Farey can you remember I posted a clip which shows that when radiating hair blows out. What can we get from that clip? This is my hypothesis: At resurrection Jesus body got dematerialized and radiation emitted from the body. Due to this radiation image was formed on the Shroud. During this process hair got blown out and as a result of that draped cloth expanded on the cheek area and image of hair got printed on the blood absorbed area of the cheek. Mr. Farey what do you think?

According to Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus wrapped the body of Jesus with a clean linen cloth and Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses and also other women which came with him from Galilee were there. Furthermore those Gospels do not tell anything about applying spices. But John who was not at the tomb tell us that Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus wound the body of Jesus with the spices. Furthermore Gospels Matthew, Mark and Luke tell us that these ladies came to tomb at the end of the Sabbath (at dawn) with spices to anoint the body. I think John who was not at the tomb on Friday evening assumed that Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus anoint the body of Jesus spices and wound the body of Jesus with linen clothes. Contrast to the other synoptic gospels John does not tell that women went to tomb to anoint the body with spices. So what did John see at the tomb on the Sunday morning? He saw the face cloth, he saw the linen cloth which was used to wrap the body of Jesus and also he saw the other linen clothes which was not used but intend to use on Sunday, to wrapped the body of Jesus, after anointing the body with spices..","date":"2015-09-24","mins":"6:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/09/22/recent-interview-with-russ-breault/","cat":"video","title":"Recent Interview with Russ Breault"},{"id":"comment-211116","author":"sampath_fernando","post":"Thank you Louis.

Some assumptions may be correct and the other may be wrong. My assumption for the formation of image is dematerialization of the body and related radiation from it. As most of the Christians believe, Jesus did not resurrect bodily but resurrect only spiritually. Jesus resurrected with his spiritual body and discarded his material body. (Remember Jesus once said that spirit (or spiritual body) is willing but flesh (material body) is weak) So no one knows how the radiation initiated and also during that process how the body was reacted. Also no one knows what happen to the hair. My assumption is that most probably hair got blown out during this process. As I have previously stated the force of the blown out hair helped to raise the wrapped cloth such a way the image of the hair got printed on the formally blood tainted area of the cheeks. That was the main reason that image got blood in hair. This expansion of cloth in the face area is main reason for not to have image from the top of the head. No forger or no painter place blood in the hair.
