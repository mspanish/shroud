{"image":[{"author":"hany","post":"Dear friends, this is a fake news as the Shroud of Turin hasn’t been disproved as they claim. In fact this so called research has been debunked by many researchers throughout the western world among whom are the scientists of NASA in the USA who worked on the shroud and discovered that the image of Our Lord that is imprinted on the shroud is a three-dimensional image and that it is a negative image that couldn’t have been painted with brush and colours. The question that these so-called scientists who reject the shroud should answer if they are honest with themselves is how could an image fabricated in the middle ages as they claim could have been painted as a negative image that couldn’t have been produced except with the invention of photography in the first half of the 19th century. Also, how could an image on a shroud fabricated in the middle ages as they claim could have been made as a three-dimensional image when the three-dimensional imaging hasn’t become known except in the 70s of the 20th century. These scientists are willing to say anything because they are dishonest and they take advantage of the people’s ignorance to propagate their unbelief knowing full well that the simple people won’t suspect their foul play. The fact is that the amazing image couldn’t have been formed as a three-dimensional, negative as it is on the shroud without having that shroud exposed to a tremendous power that had emanated from the body of Our Risen Lord and God Jesus Christ during the time of the resurrection. These and other evidences like the dicovery of first century tree pollens that are found only in palestine and turkey add greatly to the authenticity of the Shroud.There are tons of scientific books that have been written by scientists who have studied the shroud that prove the scientific ansd spiritual credibility of the shroud starting the book ‘La passion du Christ selon le linceul du Turin” by the french Surgeon Dr. Barbet to the book “LA PASSION DE JESUS, de Gethsemanie au Sepulcre” by Dr. Jean-Maurice Clercq to the book” The Shroud, a guide” by Gino Moretto. May Our Lord and God Jesus Christ who is the Resurrection and the Life who rose again bodily from the grave by the power of his Divinity grant us the power of his resurrection so that we can experience a triumphant faith in him who is the ONLY TRUE GOD AND SAVIOR.\n\n","date":"March 8, 2010 at 4:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/10/12/interfax-religion/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Interfax-Religion"}]}
