{"dating":[{"author":"dennis_reel","post":"I understand your point and it is valid. I worry though that I cannot find a shred of that peer review online. I’m only a science student at the moment and I’ll keep looking harder. I find it somewhat dubious though that the information wasn’t made generally available. I think that something like this needs to be tested by some non-christians to gain any more credibility or that peer review has to become supremely transparent to the entire scientific community in order to reproduce the findings. They aren’t interested in shredding the myth though; it makes more money as a mystery.\n\n","date":"April 19, 2013 at 8:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/23/again-the-issue-of-peer-review/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again, the Issue of Peer Review"}]}
