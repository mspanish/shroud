{"art":[{"author":"pamela_susette","post":"I believe that Akiane really did have a vision of Jesus.  This picture witness in my heart that this is what Jesus looks like. I don’t see any resembles in the other pictures looking like what she painted.  The other pictures paint Jesus as a very gloomy person when He was a man of life and joy. I would never had picture Him to look like this.  It just looks like someone I would wait on at Walmart and I believe that Jesus look just like the normal guy walking the streets which shows how much He loved us to be come one of us.  He didn’t come into this world to be handsome, rich and famous but to be an average, normal guy to relate to us common folks and to me this is handsome.  People like to explain miracles away because they just have a hard time believing in the supernatural. This modern world is full of doubting Thomas who can’t believe on less they see it too but Jesus said it is more bless to believe then to see.  What is so sad is even in this modern world people wouldn’t believe even if Jesus did appear to them because their minds are so blind. The modern world has made make believe to be so real that if a real T-Rex came a live people would even explain it away as just being a robot running down the street.  Holly Wood can just make about any thing look real on the screen why should we believe our eyes.  It takes the Holy Spirit living in side someone to discern the real from the fake.\n\n","date":"October 19, 2011 at 10:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/24/more-on-akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"More on Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Shroud"}]}
