It well may be that a positive judgment on the Shroud at this juncture comes down to a question of temperament and you, perhaps because of more scientific training in the relevant disciplines, are more judiciously restrained.  Fair enough.  The points you make are certainly worth considering.  It would be precipitous of me to reject what you say outright but not, I think, to place a bit less weight on it insofar as I still find the balance of the case for authenticity convincing.  My reason, at the most basic level, has to do with the confluence of what you call the circumstantial evidence.  In law it is often held that a circumstantial case can be stronger than one depending on direct evidence, eyewitness testimony for instance.  I think the same is true here.  It is not so much one thing alone as the interlocking of many independent pieces of the puzzle, the fit of the facts as much as their individual power to convince.  I said it is a matter of temperament, but perhaps a better way to put it is that the judgment boils down to one of perspective.  Some of us, and as you demonstrate not without reason, focus more closely than others.  Both perspectives may indeed be necessary.  All I would point out is that there is a pretty massive forest here as well as separate trees.\n\n","date":"October 17, 2013 at 5:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/16/holding-the-shroud-to-an-impossible-standard/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Holding the Shroud to an impossible standard?"},{"author":"r_h_cahall","post":"Here we go again.\nThe expansion of the universe is a strictly scientific question that can only be settled by indirect observation (used to be red-shifts, I’m not sure what they’re doing now).  You can’t stand outside the universe and watch it grow.  The authenticity of the Shroud of Turin is, finally, an historical question, to the resolution of which scientific investigation is undoubtedly quite relevant but not (absent a knock-down countervailing fact, which the carbon dating proved not to be) wholly dispositive, and the Shroud can be observed directly.\nOf course this doesn’t mean theories cannot be proposed and revised about this or that aspect of, say, the manner of image formation.  In the end, however, you have a lot more going on here than science or scientific speculation, and methods of “proof” (read: “authentication”) that are actually more intelligible.  You are, at a certain point, entitled to plead the weight of the evidence, as well as the absence of credible counter-evidence.  The standards involve reasonable doubt, not hyperbolic doubt.\nHyperbolic doubt is a somewhat strained philosophical method inappropriate here.  It is not incumbent upon anyone to doubt, doubt, doubt until his dying breath.  Given enough weight to the total evidence, historical, artifactual (archaeological), scientific, etc., it is not reasonable to do so.  It may be a judgment call as to when the weight of evidence tips the scale, but we are not and should not be free to postpone it indefinitely.\nLegitimate questions and issues will always remain to be investigated.  This is, after all, a highly complex subject.  But such investigations can be done in light of a general consensus.  They do not need to be prodded along by some sort of strange unending scepticism.\n\n","date":"June 20, 2014 at 10:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/20/everyones-own-facts/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Everyone’s Own Facts"},{"author":"r_h_cahall","post":"Thank you for your reply to my recent email.

That is simply the nature of this sort of inquiry.\n     In a sense you indirectly support my basic contention because none of the questions you raise is potentially disconfirming, a striking fact in itself.  If the absence of an hypothesized Hebrew word, or type of pollen, on the Shroud served to demonstrate its inauthenticity, rather than merely the fallacy of the particular (confirming) hypothesis, then what you say regarding suspension of judgment would, to that extent, hold true.  But none of the issues you raise has that character.  At worst, the mountain of evidence in favor of a positive judgment would have a few less stones.\n     This is the chief thing about the Shroud.  Beyond what I’ve already called a botched carbon 14 test, NOTHING disconfirms its authenticity.  All the solid evidence of which I am aware is in its favor, and that evidence is so striking, and the facts so mutually supportive, I truly cannot see why you would believe the sum to be insufficient.\n     Therefore, I respectfully reiterate my complaint, that you do seem to me to be holding the Shroud to an impossible standard.  There will never be a time when you cannot point to something yet to be proven, but should such a circumstance prevent you from rendering a perfectly reasonable judgment on the basis of what is now known, given the extent and quality of the evidence?\n     Thanks again.

Certainly anyone who considers the carbon dating fiasco cannot regard those results as evidence.  At a minimum a retest would be required to establish any carbon dating evidence whatsoever.\nSo what is the evidence, what is the weight of evidence, against authenticity?  Where is it?  Have I not been looking in the right places?

My only reason for making it is certainly not to convince you but the fact that the confusion itself is important enough to address generally.\nYou persist in confusing a trial with a collection of individual expressions of opinion.  In any trial, certainly the more notorious ones, there arise thousands of individual opinions based indifferently on reasoned consideration, or inadequate facts, or pure prejudice.  The trial itself, on the other hand, is the most comprehensive way we can devise, albeit imperfect in some respects, to ascertain the truth of a given situation and pass a reasoned judgment on it.  That is the consensus I refer to.\nYou want there to be a grand separation between some sort of idealized “truth” and a rather tawdry “publicly accepted truth”, both in law and in science.  We all know mistakes can be made and, knowing it, do what is humanly possible to avoid them.  We also know that, for the sake of the coherence of our civilization, the ability to make certain judgments with truly reasonable confidence is vital.  You on the other hand seem to think this is just a perpetual game that we can play merely for the sake of playing it.  The game of interminable doubt.  The game of hyperbolic scepticism.  It really won’t do.\nA scientific/historical trial, such as the Shroud is being subjected to, differs in many respects from a legal one, but the similarities are sufficient, and sufficiently important, to justify importing the term.  We do what we can to arrive at the most solidly reasoned consensus.  This is what happens in science as well, and has throughout its history.\nThe original post, and my response to it, had to do with not becoming so fixated on minutiae that the overall shape of the facts is ignored.  In science, as in law, that overall picture can be, and often is, dispositive.  A legal case based on a well-knit pattern of circumstantial evidence is often regarded as much stronger than one based on the single fact of an eyewitness, for instance.  No one, including the original post here, is saying that individual facts should not be investigated appropriately: that is part of what a trial is and does.  Thus your penultimate paragraph is pure drivel.

Yes.  This is the sort of balance that is required, and not only in Shroud studies.  I have worked with some of the Cantorian problems myself and can subscribe fully to the statement, and the sentiment, that “there are limits to the pure science approach that not even mathematics can resolve”.  (Recall what Russell said, that we are able to mathematize science not because we know so much about Nature but because we know so little.)\nThere is indeed a difference between science and scientism, and to realize it may be the beginning of wisdom for many.  Yet there is also, as you say, a deeper wisdom: the “divine spark”.  We may err, but what is transcendent within us can know the error as error, either actually or in the common potential of human activity.\nThe Shroud sits at the most profound conjunction of science and religion.  All the incomparable brilliance of Brahmanic civilization did not see fit to invent science because it had no need of science.  Prophetic Monotheism, most specifically the Catholic Church, invented science due I believe to pressures arising within itself to address an imbalance caused by too great a reliance on the mythological.  Prophetic Monotheism is essentially historical, not mythological.  The Bible is crucially rooted in history and fact.  Jesus again and again emphasized practical issues and practical consequences.  While grounded in it, the Church had over centuries begun to lose vital contact with that dimension.  The Shroud, and studies related to it, can in my opinion be seen as part of a great spiritual renewal that is not scientific per se, not the sort of heresies Teilhard was peddling for instance, but a revitalization in which the scientific spirit and outlook play a crucial role.  Your point of view, as opposed to some others I have encountered in this blog and elsewhere, seems consonant with such an idea.\nThe divine spark is our access to the superintelligible.

Examples, non-trivial examples, could be multiplied into the hundreds, as the brothers Dimond do.  That they, and the pre Vatican II Church run counter to the spirit of the age is obvious.  That liberal Catholicism these days is trying to dance as fast as it can to the tune being piped for it by an all too questionable culture can hardly be in serious doubt.  (And yes I realize it can always point to certain social teachings on abortion, marriage, and so on–all to the good, but subject to serious erosion by the forces of political correctness within.  Indeed a philosophical analysis of its basis for attacking abortion can, and in my opinion does, serve to exemplify Nietzsche’s remark that the best way to attack a position is to defend it with weak arguments.  There are whole book length studies by legitimate scholars on how a liberal agenda tends to lurk within the Trojan Horse of conservative phraseology.  It is at least an issue.)\nGranted the Counter-Reformation Church, by the nineteenth century, could be seen as becoming a bit sclerotic and self-absorbed, there is nonetheless a question of whether the cure has been worse than the disease.  One post Vatican II Pope referred to it as the “smoke of Satan”.  As characterizations go, things can hardly get much worse.\nAs for the teaching of “outside the Church there is no salvation”, that was never intended or interpreted as excluding any non-Catholic specifically, granting that God could work as He will with respect to whomever He will.  Indeed, my own experience with the pre Vatican II Church was of tolerance, generosity of spirit, and great spirituality.  It was sublime.\nSo while you are, of course, free to disagree with the brothers Dimond, I think it is profoundly misguided to ridicule them, and by implication the deep pain felt by those who do not share what can legitimately be regarded as destructively liberal sentiments.  There are real concerns here of great import and they at least deserve respect.  A blog devoted to the Shroud should be able to manage that much.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2013 at 2:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/well-no-you-cant-call-him-a-catholic-wingnut-wingnut-yes/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Well, no.

However comic such an assessment may be in terms of ordinary geography, in certain other areas it is no more than common sense.  In charity, and with all due respect, Mr. Klotz is simply mistaken, and not as a matter of mere inadvertence but technically and fundamentally.\n     While it is unexceptionable that Newton’s work did lead some people to philosophical determinism, it is no less so that Newton himself and many scientists following him were not so deceived.  This is Newton writing in the General Scholium: “But there is no direct sense and there are no indirect reflected actions by which we know innermost substances…  No variation in things arises from blind metaphysical necessity, which must be the same always and everywhere.  All the diversity of created things, each in its own time and place, could only have arisen from the ideas and will of a necessarily existing being.”\n     Newton was not only a man of incomparable brilliance, the greatest mathematician since Archimedes, but a great man in the sense Washington would prove himself great: someone unwilling to press an extreme advantage beyond the bounds of Reason.  It is perfectly possible to acknowledge Newton’s physics and, with Newton, remain a theist with all such belief entails.  It is also possible to acknowledge Heisenberg’s physics and be a complete atheist.  Nor is quantum physics itself, as David Bohm held, necessarily indeterministic, and moreover it is at least infelicitous to say, with Mr. Klotz, that quantum indeterminism consists in obeying the rules of probability.  (What sort of “obedience” accords with philosophic indeterminism?)\n     To say that the notion of quantum information “would explain the ‘substance’ of humanity” is utterly misguided.  It is to credit physics with a level of intelligibility it does not, and cannot, possess.  You can’t get to the substance of humanity from physics.  No less a quantum physicist than Richard Feynman in a lecture once admitted that he had not the slightest idea what he was talking about, only that what he was saying happened to be supremely accurate.  He couldn’t say why it was so, but only that it was so.\n     As for the appearance-substance dichotomy in Aquinas, I have never heard or read of it as a “translation of concerns advanced by Plato”.  Aquinas didn’t call Aristotle “the Philosopher” for nothing.\n     I read this blog to try and keep up with scientific researches relevant to determining the authenticity of the Shroud.  That is very different from trying to use the Shroud or anything else to bootstrap scientistic notions about the philosophical claims of physics.  I therefore respectfully suggest that Mr. Klotz needs to reevaluate his case.\n\n","date":"March 23, 2014 at 12:25 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/23/john-klotz-from-his-upcoming-book/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"John Klotz from his upcoming book"}],"resources":[{"author":"r_h_cahall","post":"Mr. Klotz,\nIf you are defining the God of Prophetic Monotheism as primordial consciousness, you are making a terrible mistake.

For instance, the difference between an explanation and a correlation.  Even more significantly, the difference between a scientific explanation and a philosophical one.  I quoted Newton’s General Scholium in another thread, to point out that he himself understood very well the difference between what science can uncover and what lies forever beyond it.\nYou do not understand that any sufficiently comprehensive philosophical position can account for any scientific finding.  Consider solipsism.  Very few accept it, but it is nevertheless notoriously difficult to refute.  A comprehensive philosophy is in that regard a bit like comprehensive insanity.  Someone who is truly insane can explain anything in terms of his prior determinations.  Indeed few people, as Chesterton observed, can be as thoroughly rational as a madman.\nHaving examined the problems for some time, I have become convinced that there are no knock-down arguments to establish idealism, materialism (physicalism), or dualism.  They are ground level positions adopted prior to the possibility of argument.  They are, in fine, rhetorical premises, not logical conclusions.\nI myself happen to be a kind of dualist: I call my own version “transcendental dualism”.  The operative phrase is “happen to be”.  I cannot provide an argument TO it, but I can certainly argue FROM it.  The best I can do with respect to the position itself is make a rhetorical, or plausibility, argument.  That is for the unexceptionable reason that any argument whatsoever must be grounded in what is accepted without question, without itself being a conclusion.  It is in other words grounded in faith.\nScience simply does not operate at that level.  Science is no doubt important in all sorts of ways, and can be brought into properly philosophical arguments in support of contentions grounded beforehand in a properly philosophical manner.  It cannot, really CANNOT, be the foundation of a truly philosophical position.  Science is bounded, as Newton well knew, by the limitations of its own nature.  It cannot overstep itself, however fervently some may wish it.\nYou really are basing your work on fundamental mistakes, category errors, that will vitiate the entire project.  Of course, that’s your business, but I thought I’d at least point it out.  Even more insidiously, you are constructing a “God” out of various scientific findings that has nothing to do with the God of Jesus Christ and is profoundly irrelevant to any theological considerations of the Shroud.\nWith all due respect, your position is a real mess philosophically, theologically, and even scientifically.  It cannot\nmove any relevant discussion forward in a meaningful way.\nFinally, I don’t give a tinker’s dam what anyone’s IQ is.  I have met enough high IQ idiots to convince me that whatever is being measured in that way, it isn’t real intelligence.\n\n","date":"March 31, 2014 at 3:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/30/john-klotz-wants-your-feedback/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Wants Your Feedback"}]}
