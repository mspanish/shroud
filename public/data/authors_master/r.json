Your security theory makes absolutely no sense, if you think about it…If the Vatican didn’t care to use the Shroud for “any purpose at all”, why would they show it at all? Why not just bury the thing in the vatican vaults, never to be seen again? …don’t be so naive Yannick.\nR\n\n","date":"January 9, 2012 at 1:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/07/tom-chivers-would-like-to-be-able-to-get-over-it-but-the-shroud-of-turin-evidence-wont-let-them/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Tom Chivers would like to be able to \"Get over it\" but the Shroud of Turin evidence won’t let them"},{"author":"r","post":"\nYannick Clément :I know the Catholic teaching well enough to know that resurrection is only a term of faith that cannot be proved scientifically. There’s nothing in the gospel or in the letters of the New Testament to support a burst of radiation or a burst of UV light or a corona discharge or something similar. There’s no scientific data found by the STURP team that can really support the ASSUMPTION that a burst of radiation, a burst of UV light, a corona discharge or something similar had anything to do with the body images.\nAll these kind of ideas are only based on the ASSUMPTION that the resurrection of Jesus SHOULD have produced a burst of some form of energy from his body. Personally, I found this idea close to the New Age philosophy or something like that and I’m fully aware that it was propagated by Hollywood movies.\nOne thing’s for sure : this whole idea is not a catholic concept.\nWe are not talking scientific proof here Yannick, you are talking Church doctrine and you can’t know the church’s stance on the resurrection or what they think the resurrection actually was because they (The Church), have never made any comments on it, whatsoever (That I know of officially)…Furthermore; of course there is nothing in scriptures about a burst of energy! As no one actually witnessed the resurrection! So how could there be? Whether or not the ‘means’ of the resurrection is a catholic concept or not, means nothing in the study of the Shroud anyways.\nI dare to differ with you that STURP findings do not support a ‘possibility’ of some form of light emission to cause the image. It is in what they HAVE NOT found, that has caused many scientists to look at this possibility, amongst others possibilities. So not just me saying or thinking this but scientists who have studied the Shroud and in depth. So this ‘assumption’ as you call it does not come from Hollywood but from scientific study!….Anyways, don’t all hypotheses start off as assumptions? Just like the vapour or milliard hypotheses do?\nR\n\n","date":"January 9, 2012 at 1:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/07/tom-chivers-would-like-to-be-able-to-get-over-it-but-the-shroud-of-turin-evidence-wont-let-them/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Tom Chivers would like to be able to \"Get over it\" but the Shroud of Turin evidence won’t let them"}],"history":[{"author":"r","post":"…and miraculous does not mean unexplainable ;-)\nR\n\n","date":"October 13, 2012 at 3:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/13/the-beast-is-sindonology/","cat":"history","title":"The beast is ‘sindonology"}]}
