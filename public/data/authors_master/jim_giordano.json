The fact that the dark green runs parallel with the weave near left edge and has a sharp end, instead of gradually fading as near the holes, indicates or at least implies a systemic or intentionally man-made contamination, such as possibly a re-weave, though could also be the applying of dyes or colourant to hide a patch, say if at one time the big rectangular hole may have been patched and coloured to hide the ugly hole.

Or put something else there and then blood later.\nMaybe you could pickup a manikin/mannequin on ebay.\nBut then you’d have to figure out how the forger got linen cloth that looks like a 1st century Syrian textile, while there is only one example of similar linen from the middle ages known to science.  And how he could pay for such a cloth as it would be worth a fortune – and cost more than what he might get for selling the shroud.\nYou know what, nevermind, just enjoy your retirement from the Shroud.

Maybe two or three separate groups (American/Canadian, British, Continental European, what the heck, how about a couple of teams from Asia too).  Anyways, before they even get a look at the Shroud they should have to read everything, EVERYTHING STURP and any other team discovered, read all the criticisims, develop their plans and publish them, to expose them to the world for further suggestions, etc., so that the final plans will make a definitive, unassailable finding – unless they uncover some other ‘mysterious’ qualities.

But the atheists will make up something, like, a lot of political prisoners would have been treated this way, or it doesn’t matter, as it doesn’t prove He rose from the dead.

Positive results won’t heal the splits in Christianity – imagine the evangelizing power of only one united message of Christ, instead of many competing versions, a lot of which are ‘lite’ and false, misleading versions.

It’s weird that the shroud image is undistorted.  If it’s a fake, that’s what you would expect from an artist doing something to a flat sheet, unless made in the manner of Colin Berry’s experiments where you would expect some distortion and forshortening from projection.  There’s diffenently projection shortening going on under the legs, and the top the legs look longer, like the shroud is following the general contour of the top – so the shroud being pulled taunt while imaging was happening wouldn’t have to be the case.\nI imagine the shroud loosely draped over the body, pulled and tucked around the feet, and then something imaged the body only from up-and-down direction and not perpendicular from the skin surface (there is no image from the side of the body or arms and legs).  The imaged depended a bit on the pressure, as IMHO the back side looks more distinct than the front.  So the either the resurrection event produced energy up and down, or a natural effect (radiation? piezo-electrical?) from the stone slab/bench and the roof of the tomb or niche in the tomb, or the faker for some reason used only a bass relief, as Colin asserts, but I don’t know why or how he could have done under the legs – or with what to make the image.\nWasn’t it Rodgers who worked out a theory that the image could be be a chemical reaction from the body and ointments, worked out that it would take about two days to get a good image and more would over-saturate it – and then realized that the only way decay products wouldn’t be embedded in the shroud or that 1st century Jews would touch such a cloth on the third day stopping the process, would be if the body wasn’t there….(and that is what really stopped the process…)\n\n","date":"October 15, 2015 at 2:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/15/maybe-the-devil-made-them-post-this/","cat":"article","title":"Maybe the devil made them post this"},{"author":"jim_giordano","post":"I meant that we don’t see the sides if the imaged areas, its like light from top and bottom reacted with the flesh to generate a reaction in the flesh that then dehydrated the fibres.

The shroud seems to follow the body around its head to foot perimeter but no around the other direction.  However it has been shown that the blood stains do seem to follow around the body contours in both axises (axes?)(axis’s?).  See how that starts to affect our understanding of how the Shroud was faked, made naturally, or shows how the Resurrection happened.  Is it possible, that if the Shroud was just allowed to drape around the body, but tight around the head and feet since we have a good image of the feet, that the imaging process would be gentle enough not to affect the fibres noticeably, but yet strong enough to give the image that we have.
