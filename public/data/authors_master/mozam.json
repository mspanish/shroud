{"misc":[{"author":"mozam","post":"The image on the shroud seems to be a “bump map” describing 3D space in continuous tones of image density. What’s more, the ratios in density-to-distance from the view plane (the linen itself) of the image seem to be uniform across the entire image. I can’t imagine how this image could have even been conceptualized, much less actually produced, until the invention of photography.\nIs it even possible to produce a recreation of the shroud using modern technology? It would be hard to see how this could be done.\n\n","date":"October 8, 2009 at 6:20 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/10/08/arts-and-crafts-is-not-science/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Arts and Crafts Is Not Science"}]}
