{"history":[{"id":"comment-210704","author":"g","post":"Hello all, What blows my mind is how the image of the body ended up on the linen clothe and how, in my opinion, it is the most outstanding achievement of the artifact that none of you and not even science itself can explain. All the blah, blah, blah surrounding this issue is for not because it cannot be told how this had happened. Now, if you consider this to be the burial clothe of Jesus and if he is who he claimed to be; historically speaking, God’s savior to all mankind, the last sacrificial lamb, then it wouldn’t be a stretch to say the image was created by his coming back to life in a supernatural way and this is why science and those who have no clue of the history of Jesus’s claims cannot explain how it came to be on the shroud itself. This is where science needs to let history play a part of coming to a solid conclusion and let certain historical books explain things that they now nothing of. Yes and let’s go back to the old testament. If one wants to sincerely seek all things involved unbiasedly and get down to what this involves then one must research everything in order to come to a solid conclusion to what the shroud is all about. (Real or memorix) A historical documentation, so to speak, of the things of what has been documented in the Bible. All one needs to do is to research prophetic scripture and you will see all that is on the shroud was foretold. I look at the shroud and read it like the book of books. Science is fascinating but belief in something that is outside our understanding is difficult without faith. So, if this was the burial shroud of the risen Yehoshua Hamashiac, then WOW!!! Thank you to all involved.","date":"2015-09-19","mins":"9:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/29/barrie-schwortz-dismisses-freemans-claims-it-was-the-science/","cat":"history","title":"Barrie Schwortz Dismisses Freeman’s Claims: It was the Science"}]}
