{"events":[{"author":"donna_ward","post":"The Shroud of Turin will be exhibited at 12:15pm EDT.  That is around noon, NOT early in the morning.  The east coast of the U.S. is 5 hours earlier than Italy.  For instance, as I write this it is 7:42 am in Indiana.  It is 12:40pm in the afternoon in Italy.  Current Italian time can be checked at http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current_time_in_IT.aspx    I too hope we are able to view the actual exhibition.","date":"March 30, 2013 at 7:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/awaiting-live-stream-from-rai-uno/","cat":"event","title":"Awaiting Live Stream from RAI Uno"}]}
