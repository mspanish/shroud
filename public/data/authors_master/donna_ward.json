Current Italian time can be checked at http://www.worldtimeserver.com/current time in IT.aspx I too hope we are able to view the actual exhibition..","date":"2013-03-30","mins":"7:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/awaiting-live-stream-from-rai-uno/","cat":"event","title":"Awaiting Live Stream from RAIÂ Uno"}]}
