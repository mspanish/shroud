There is; however, a difference in length on the Edessa Cloth. On the coin image featured above, we the right side of the head (left on the photo). That the hair continues down from the inverted “v” to the lighted area that looks as though it is a script version of the letter “Y,” at the neck. Then two broad lines continue outward from the neck. One of the broad lines is an elongated upside down “Y” and the other broad line is straight. Both broad lines continue to the shoulder and are obviously the artist’s rendition of Jesus’ hair. On the left side of the head (right looking at the image), the hair is wavy to the neck, and then there is a double broad line that falls to the shoulder. All the broad lines on both sides of the head project outward from the shoulder, clearly indicating the broad lines are hair. Therefore, on both sides of the head the hair is symmetrcal and falls to the shoulder. The artist failed to include the Trinity (3) blood spot above the left eyebrow, evidenced on the negative of the Shroud image, just to the right of the nose. The artist, as well, failed to include the blood intermingled with Jesus’ hair. The blood “3” was obvious on the Shroud and certainly would have been included on the coin, if the Shroud image was used as the model. I don’t believe it was. The nose on the Edessa cloth (King Abgar) does not look as straight as the nose on the Shroud image, and the hair on the Edessa cloth is shorter on the left side of the head. One thing amazes me though. If Jesus rubbed his face on the Edessa cloth and gave it to King Abgar for healing, then why would the Edessa cloth have the blood “3” at the forehead and also the blood spots intermingled through Jesus’ hair? This blood should not have been on the Edessa cloth, as Jesus was alive when he sent the cloth to King Abgar for healing. With that in mind, the “Edessa Cloth,” (King Abgar) had to be pressed to Jesus’ face, either after his death or on the road to the cross; otherwise there would be no visible blood on the Edessa cloth image. And there does appear to be the blood “3” above the left eyebrow on the Edessa cloth and a few blood spots in the hair. There must be another cloth, still not found, that would have been used for King Abgar’s healing and this must be the cloth used as a model for the coin. When Jesus pressed his face to the cloth, the nose would have been distorted on the cloth as pushed to the side or not straight, and there is no blood on this image, as well. Just my opinion!.","date":"2012-10-24","mins":"12:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/10/22/based-on-the-shroud-of-turin-justinian-ii-solidus-has-face-of-christ-with-skewed-nose-and-unbalanced-hair-length/","cat":"art","title":"Based  on the Shroud of Turin: Justinian II Solidus has Face of Christ with Skewed Nose and Unbalanced Hair Length?"},{"id":"comment-18234","author":"angel","post":"Ron, I found the article for the Edessa image.

Approximately two decades ago, I attended two seminars given by Dr. Alan Adler, the Porphrin Chemist, who was initially a member of STURP. He performed the blood studies on the Shroud. I distinctly remember Dr. Adler stating. “I am so good in my field that had the shroud not been exposed to a flood, causing water damage, I could have told you if Jesus was circumcized or not.” Obviously, he was referring to that private area. With that in mind, some researchers have stated DNA studies determined a trisomy (XXY) on the sex chromosome, indictative of Kleinfelter Syndrome, while other scientific researchers determined this chromosome to be XX with a Y embedded into one of the Xs or de la Chapelle Syndrome, referred to as XX male. Further, I have read de la Chapelle mimics Kleinfelter and, as well, de la Chapelle syndrome is often misdiagnosed. Regardless, as to what is finally determined (Kleinfelter Syndrome or de la Chapelle Syndrome), the salient feature of both are female traits in the male. Now, observe the full body image of the Shroud of Turin and then look closely at the upper portion of the body and then compare this image to the image posted on this site (link below) Comment Promoted: The Stavronikita Epitaphios https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/28/comment promoted the stavronikita epitaphios/#comment 134352 Now compare the two images mentioned above to that of the Hungarian Pray Codex. As a woman, I am clearly able to see female breasts on all three images, indicating either Kleinfelter Syndrome (XXY) or de la Chapelle Syndrome, (XX male). Men diagnosed with Kleinfelter Syndrome are very tall, as a rule, and have female breasts. Jesus was tall, compared to other Jewish males, at that time. I realize, as well, most believe Ron Wyatt was a fake, but surprisingly, back in the 70s or 80s, he found blood beneath the cross hole, after engineering a a dig into Zedekiah’s cave and supposedly, he had that black blood reconstituted and scientifically analyzed. The lab analysis also revealed the trisomy XXY. This study was done prior to any of the more recent studies on the sex chromosomes. Finally concluding, what are your thoughts concerning the relationship of female traits, found in men with an extra X chromosome, to the three images I’ve mentioned in the paragraphs above? Are you clearly able to see what appears obvious to me or do I need an opthalmologist? :) And if you are able to make the connection of the female traits on the shroud image to the other images, would you consider this to be a type of proof, considering sex chromosome studies verify the images? Thanks in advance.

In Iron’s reduced state (deoxygenated, Ferrous, Fe^2+) blood is dark red in color; however, in the oxygenated state, Ferric, Fe^3+) blood is bright red. Therefore, oxygenated blood would be bright red only because it has been kinetically oxidized by oxygen in the AIR. In a sealed glass container, free of oxygen, where the shroud was held, the blood would appear as a dark red or brownish color. So, if one were to look at the Shroud, where it is displayed under a vacuum seal, within a glass container, the blood stains would appear to the observer as dark red or brown, but when the Shroud is removed from this glass casing, and exposed to air, the blood would appear bright red in color. The color of the blood is dependent on oxidation state of Iron. With ultraviolet blood irradiation, known as photoluminescence, there is an increase in oxygenation of the blood, and therefore the iron in hemoglobin would be in the oxygenated state (Fe^3+) and would appear as bright red in color.

Here is an excerpt from the link below: “Feeling for blood Zink and his colleagues took tissue samples from Ötzi’s arrow wound and from an earlier wound on the mummy’s hand. Using a light microscope, they identified round objects that looked a bit like red blood cells, Zink said. But to be sure, the researchers needed more advanced technology. They turned to a device called an atomic force microscope, which works by “feeling” rather than “seeing” an object. The minuscule probe, itself invisible to the naked eye, runs over the object like a needle on a record player. As the probe bumps up and down along the object’s contours, a laser measures the movement. The result is a three dimensional “tracing” of the object.

Certainly the Gospels did not mention Jesus had a sex chromosome trisomy (XXY), nor did the Gospels mention, in regard to maternal DNA (mt DNA), Jesus had a mutant genetic marker at 150 T. What specific genetic disease is associated with that marker? While it is probable Methemaglobin was the result of trauma and stress, we are not certain Jesus was deficient in producing the diaphorase enzyme, nor if Jesus had an abnormal hemoglobin variant (Hemoglobin M).

Below is an excerpt from Doug Leatherman, MD, on Jesus’ massive blood loss: “There is much disagreement among the authorities as to the scourging. This was a Roman, not a Jewish, custom. The hands were tied high to a tree or post. A whip was made of a short wood handle and heavy leather straps bearing usually the sharp bones of sheep knuckles or lead balls on the ends. The Jews forbade more than forty lashes (thirty nine was the maximum allowed), but the Romans did not have this limit. The scourging was usually carried out by a Roman soldier. The whip was brought down upon the bare back, cutting the skin first; then as the beating progressed, the muscles were laid bare, bruised and bleeding with marked loss of blood. In a significant number of instances this was enough to kill a man. Ribs were broken, nerves exposed. Again and again, down came the whip until either death or unconsciousness occurred. Both venous and arterial bleeding occurred. Large deep, dark, bruised surfaces began to appear. Finally the skin of the back is hanging in long shreds. The whole area is an unrecognizable mass of torn, bleeding tissue.” http://www.churches of christ.net/tracts/job004u.htm Here is an image of the flagrum that was used on Jesus’ scourging. Note the metal balls attached to the leather whip. Http://www.indyprops.com/pp flagrum.htm Therefore, a massive blood loss from 60 lashes would be an understatement.

While the general public understands that internal bleeding means bleeding that can’t be seen on the outside of the body, medical personnel tend to use terms that describe precisely where inside the body the bleeding is found. The internal bleeding may occur within tissues, organs, or in cavities of the body including the head, chest, and abdomen.

The dark brown color seen with blood; however, is due only to the oxidation state of iron in the hemoglobin molecule. When iron is deoxygenated, Iron (II) the blood appears as a dark red color. When blood hemoglobin is oxygen rich, Iron (III) the blood is then seen as bright red in color. Now, there may be a difference with aged blood, such as Otzi’s or the TS blood, or the way it was preserved over time. Perhaps, and this is only an opinion, the Shroud was kept in a sealed casket for decades, and then when it was taken out for public viewing, and exposed to air, the color became a brighter red. I don’t believe the Otzi mummy was placed in a vacuum type environment, but he was preserved in ice. Another thought came to mind. When red blood cells are placed in fresh water, they burst, so I would wonder, since the Shroud was exposed to a flood, would the red blood cells still be intact? Carbon dioxide and Carbon monoxide, as well, have an effect on blood cells. A Porphrin chemist would be able to expand on the topic. With respect to the new method, even if it isn’t scientifically accurate, Professor Zink may, at least, be able to resolve the problem of the Shroud blood being actual human blood, rather than a painter’s dye.

Excerpt: “Exsanguination is a relatively uncommon and dramatic cause of death in humans. Blunt force trauma to the liver, kidneys, and spleen can cause severe internal bleeding as well, though the abdominal cavity usually becomes visibly darkened as if bruised. Similarly, trauma to the lungs can cause bleeding out, though without medical attention blood can fill the lungs causing drowning, or in the pleura causing suffocation, well before exsanguination would occur. In addition, serious trauma can cause tearing of major blood vessels without external trauma indicative of the damage.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exsanguination Internal bleeding was evident when Jesus was pierced with the sword (blood and water poured out). Excerpt: “A number of forensic pathologists have examined the descriptions (and, in some cases, information on the Shroud of Turin). They all agree that there is no way water could have come out. But, they agree that the heart is surrounded by the pericardium, which contains a watery fluid and a lance thrust would have extracted this fluid, which would look like water. The thrust would also have pierced the heart, drawing accumulated blood. Even if Jesus didn’t die of asphyxiation and even if He didn’t die of congestive heart failure and even if He didn’t die of hypovolemic shock and even if He didn’t die from the internal hemorrhaging itself, He had a large, deep, open chest wound through at least one lung and probably the heart, with internal bleeding.

Secondly, If one had pleurisy and at the moment of death a sword was thrust into this person’s pleural cavity, fluid (water) would immediately seep out. Here is an excerpt of “Pericardial Effusion” the link below: “Those who were flogged would often go into hypovolemic shock, a term that refers to low blood volume. In other words, the person would have lost so much blood he would go into shock. The results of this would be 1) The heart would race to pump blood that was not there. 2) The victim would collapse or faint due to low blood pressure. 3) The kidneys would shut down to preserve body fluids. 4) The person would experience extreme thirst as the body desired to replenish lost fluids. There is evidence from Scripture that Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock as a result of being flogged. As Jesus carried His own cross to Golgotha (John 19:17), He collapsed, and a man named Simon was forced to either carry the cross or help Jesus carry the cross the rest of way to the hill (Matthew 27:32–33; Mark 15:21–22; Luke 23:26). This collapse indicates Jesus had low blood pressure. Another indicator that Jesus suffered from hypovolemic shock was that He declared He was thirsty as He hung on the cross (John 19:28), indicating His body’s desire to replenish fluids. Prior to death, the sustained rapid heartbeat caused by hypovolemic shock also causes fluid to gather in the sack around the heart and around the lungs. This gathering of fluid in the membrane around the heart is called pericardial effusion, and the fluid gathering around the lungs is called pleural effusion. This explains why, after Jesus died and a Roman soldier thrust a spear through Jesus’ side (probably His right side, piercing both the lungs and the heart), blood and water came from His side just as John recorded in his Gospel (John 19:34). Http://www.gotquestions.org/blood water Jesus.html And below is an excerpt on the subject of the blood and water. “One view concerns the pericardium, the sac which surrounds the heart, and which contains a small amount of watery fluid. When the body undergoes great stress, as crucifixion would certainly entail, the amount of fluid increases and the sac expands. The Roman lance would then have passed through Jesus’ pericardium and into the right side of his heart, which is filled with blood even after death. As the lance was withdrawn, it would draw out the blood from the heart and the watery fluid from the expanded pericardium.” And there is a second view is as follows; “Anthony Sava, an American physician, has a different explanation for the water flow. He believes that the severe scourging caused internal hemorrhaging in Jesus’ chest, and the pleural cavity filled with blood. The blood settled on the bottom of the chest cavity while a clear liquid was left on top. Sava says that the Roman lance entered the chest and, upon being withdrawn, released the blood and the water from the chest.” Either of the two views gave the conclusion: The explanations for the blood and water flow are closely related at several points. All physicians who have examined the question agree that Jesus was already dead when the chest wound was inflicted. The blood and water most probably flowed from both the heart and the chest cavity.

Assuming he was an actual person (i believe there is a high possibility he was an actual person even though i am an atheist. Therefore, since Ron found the XXY and the female who reported a trisomy, as well, my conclusion was the trisomy was Kleinfelter’s as opposed to Down, as the female researcher reported. Kleinfelter’s is on the 46 chromosome and instead of an XY there is an XXY which is noted 47 XXY Since Ron found a haploid, 23, instead of a full 46 the sex chromosome would have been on the 23 chromosome, instead of the normal chromosome 46 and the trisomy reported as 24 XXY as was reported. Therefore, one researcher stated Down syndrome and the other indicates Kleinfelter’s sydrome. If you look at Jesus’ height (very tall), the long arms and fingers, the long legs, then Kleinfelter’s more aligns with Jesus over Down syndrome and Ron got a chromosome count of 24 XXY from the blood beneath the cross hole. Ron further stated dead blood will not give a chromosome count, but he had the lab keep the blood at room temperature with gentle swirling for 48 hours and the blood came to life. Some scientists disagreed with his chromosome count and others believed. Here is the account of a Geneticist who attended the same church as Ron.

The shoulders or back could not be produced. In 1978, when the Shroud was examined, the backside of the cloth was not accessible because at that time, it was sewn to a backing cloth.” http://www.allaboutarchaeology.org/second image on the shroud of turin faq.htm Anyway, it was just a passing thought.

My thought was if Jesus were constrained by the Shroud, fitting tightly around His body, and He wanted to transform from the mortal to the spiritual (celestial) body, He would break free of the cloth in some manner, perhaps raising the top half of the cloth. The two missing panels and the missing side stream would have certainly given Him the room to maneuver during the transformation.

Is it possible the Turin Shroud image formation was produced via a two step process, similar to obtaining a sunburn at the beach? One would lie on his or her back and the front of the body would be burned and then he or she would turn over onto the stomach and the back of the body would be burned. There would be no burning on the crown of the head or the soles of the feet as the sun’s rays beam down vertically. Prior to Jesus leaving the tomb, His body may have produced the frontal image, while He was lying on His back and He may have turned just once, onto His stomach, to produce the dorsal image, before leaving the Shroud. Perhaps the image on the Shroud was accomplished with a photon release that occurs with bioluminescence. Isn’t it true Madam Flury Lemberg, after removing the backing of the cloth, found the side strip fluoresced? See Article excerpt from the link below: “Humans glow in the dark Ultra sensitive cameras reveal that our bodies emit tiny amounts of light that are too weak for the human eye to detect. Bioluminescence is a side effect of metabolic reactions within all creatures, the result of highly reactive free radicals produced through cell respiration interacting with free floating lipids and proteins. The “excited” molecules that result can react with chemicals called fluorophores to emit photons. Human bioluminescence has been suspected for years, but until now the cameras required to detect such dim light sources took over an hour to capture a single image and so were unable to measure the constantly fluctuating light from living creatures.” http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/jul/17/human bioluminescence.","date":"2014-03-08","mins":"9:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"id":"comment-88921","author":"angel","post":"Yannick, maybe Fanti was so disillusioned by the erroneous C 14 dating of the Shroud that his research goal was to find something so unique and so incredibly difficult to produce that the non believers would eventually stop trumpeting, “The C 14 dating proves the Shroud is a fake” or “The image, according to Mc Crone, is the result of tempera paint containing red ochre and vermilion.”.","date":"2014-03-14","mins":"7:14 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/05/concerning-the-absence-of-an-image-of-the-top-of-the-head-on-the-shroud-of-turin-and-the-possible-presence-of-blood-in-this-area/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Concerning the absence of an image of the top of the head on the Shroud of Turin and the possible presence of blood in this area"},{"id":"comment-15961","author":"angel","post":"Confusing: I attended two seminars given by Dr. Adler, the Porphrin Chemist (now deceased), who performed the initial blood work on the Shroud of Turin.

No, Hugh, I wasn’t suggesting the Shroud moved with the body. Instead, in this 2 step process, Jesus was placed on His back inside the tomb, after crucifixion and enfolded in the Shroud. So, the process to which I refer would be tantamount to going to the beach and lying on a beach towel. After receiving a sunburn on the front of the body, the person would turn and the back of the body would then be burned. The beach towel, equivalent to the Shroud, in this case, would remain stationary. Yes, the CCD camera took 20 minutes to produce an image, but Jesus was in the tomb for 3 days. As well, the photons released in bioluminescence may be the reason why, when the backing of the cloth was removed by Mechthild Flury Lemberg, the side strip fluoresced. Since the linen side strip was added at a later date, the half life may have been longer than the older linen of the Shroud. If Jesus was able to rise, place the folded Shroud and head napkin onto the marble slab, don His celestial/spiritual garment of bright white, prior to leaving the tomb, then He certainly would have been able to turn His body from back to front, just once.

I do love reading your posts! Yes, I completely comprehend Fibonnaci numbers, as this topic was included in one of my undergrad chemistry courses. After the Higgs Boson (God particle) was isolated by CERN, I began researching Cooper pairs, Bose Einstein Condensates (BE Cs) and the Meisner effect, Specifically, referencing Cooper pairs or BE Cs, I believe metal superconductors, in the solid state, can lose weight and can emit light in the form of waves (like laser beams).. There is a link below that has scientifically confirmed both forms of light (particle and wave). Perhaps this antigravimetric process (Cooper pairs/superconductor) was utilized by Jesus at the resurrection, during levitation, which would be in agreement with Isabel Piczek’s Event Horizon theory, I wonder if iron was in the tomb? As well, the same would have been responsible for the fast pulsed laser light that may have produced the image on the Shroud, as theorized by Fanti. The garment composing Jesus’ spiritual body would, more than likely, have been composed of bright white light, as seen by Mary Magdalene when she viewed Him as the gardener, on the side of the road near the garden tomb. If superconductors are antigravity, then that would explain Jesus entering through the walls when He visited the disciples after His death. There are a few scientists working on superconductors, warp drives, induced gravity propulsion and antigravity space craft, etc., that may be utilized for space travel in the not too distant future. Some, like Dr. Boylan state, the Lockheed X 22a (two man discoid with onboard laser weaponry) is an antigravity craft, but it is a secret military project, and who knows if it is true. The photo of the Lockheed X 22a on google images is impressive though. I’m not a physicist, but perhaps Isabel Piczek could shed some light on the subject of superconductors, with respect to transition metals (those that fill d orbitals).

Enjoy your dinner! When I was researching the relationship between science and evolution, God’s voice came to me and stated, “It is similar to the Einstein equation.” I had always believed the Holy Spirit was male, but I was given a dream, where the Holy Spirit was walking through the trees in the Garden and I heard a swishing sound as the Spirit walked by, stating to Adam and Eve, “Who told you you were naked.” What I saw moving through the trees was a long skirt, similar to a stiff silk that had an elongated (east to west), ivory colored, brocade “V” at the top (waistband of the skirt). Yet, the waistband of the gown was at sky level and I was standing on the ground. And no matter how far up I looked, I was never able to see the face of the Holy Spirit, only the waistband of the gown, the black shoes (similar to a penny loafer, without the penny slots) and the beige cotton stockings that were slightly rolled at the ankles. The entire top half of the Holy Spirit was above sky level. And she moved in a manner that was quite awkward, as if there were too much height or weight for her frame. Scaliing down to the size of an average woman, I would say her size was about a woman’s 14. The gown (skirt) was almost Victorian in style. At this point, after having this dream, I researched to find the Holy Spirit was female gender, according to the Hebrew, Ruach Ha Kodesh. Http://www.wattpad.com/1096411 who what is the ruach hakodesh And then the dove (feminine representation) made sense, and the statement, “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased” represented the mother speaking of her son, and not the father. I don’t know if this is antithetical to Catholic doctrine, but my dream was confirmed by finding “Ruach Ha Kodesh.” This may be considered heretical, I’m not certain. I then started bleeding from a mole that suddenly manifested on my right side, ironically the same area where Jesus was pierced with the sword. The bleeding wouldn’t stop, so I visited my physician. My doctor sent me to a specialist and the dermatologist took a biopsy of the mole and told me to leave the band aid on for 24 hours. The next day, when I removed the band aid the complete facial image of Jesus was detailed, including the “3” on the forehead. The image was sharp and detailed; however, I waited a week and the blood had oxidized slightly. At that time, I placed the band aid in a cellophane bag and scanned it next to the Barrie Schwortz facial image. The only difference is in my image the head is turned about 10 degrees to the left. After that the nail marks appeared on both my feet. They were raised, red, and about a centimeter in diameter. I took a picture of these as well. And the last incident was another mole that started bleeding on the inner side of my left knee. After the biopsy, the scar healed in the shape of a perfect cross. I also took a picture of that. The scar has almost healed at this point, but luckily I took a photo. I would like to post my blood Shroud image that is positioned next to Barrie’s shroud image (for comparison) on this thread. Next to the “3” on the forehead, on my image there is also a “6” and the Hebrew for “6” is vav, which means a connection, similar to our word “and” in English. The explanation of vav is shown on the website below. Http://webpages.charter.net/yarahministries/alphabet.html If Dan would allow me to post the image, I will send it from my gmail account, since it allows the receiver to scan the image, thereby preventing viruses or malware attachments on photos. As well, I was researching whether or not Jesus died in 33 AD or 36 AD. Both had Friday passovers, but most scholars dictate 33 AD for His death, forgetting that 36 AD would also qualify. If Jesus was born April 17th 6 BC and died in 36 AD his age would be 42. This makes sense, since the Pharisee stated to Him, “You are not yet 50 years old, but you have seen Abraham.” If Jesus was died in 33 AD His age would be 39, so the statement made by the Pharisee, would not make sense. The Pharisee would have said, “You are not yet 40.”.","date":"2014-09-15","mins":"3:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/04/the-trimurti-of-the-italian-scientific-experimental-studies-on-the-shroud/","cat":"event","title":"The Trimurti of the Italian scientific-experimental studies on the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-151009","author":"angel","post":"Hi Hugh, Thanks for the advice, but there’s an alternate scenario. Scientists at reputable research universities stated it was impossible to obtain anything from dinosaur fossils, since they were merely rock and when one crushes rock, he or she obtains only dust. :) Yet, Dr. Mary Schweitzer, was able to isolate soft tissue and heme from dinosaur fossils by merely dissolving the bones in vinegar (softening them). Even Hawking referred to one of the particle pairs (referencing the annhilation of a positron electron) as a twin, when, in fact, they have opposite charges. Hardly a twin. Scientists have often been wrong. Piero only asked if it were possible to use a nano heating probe to test the white powder (heating and cooling). This experiment would take less than an hour. Yes, monoatomic gold, as I’ve further researched, is mystical, yet it could easily be tested. Http://www.halexandria.org/dward469.htm My personal belief is Jesus walked on water and resurrected using the elements of nature. The levitation would had to have involved a natural process or some type of metal acting as a superconductor and a current that would generate a magnetic field? Perhaps lightning striking the the earth vertically during the storm produced a magnetic field that allowed Jesus to walk on water. Lightning was never mentioned in the bible, with respect to the storm or the resurrection. The tomb guards may have been placed in a coma by Jesus.

Initially CERN found neutrinos traveled faster than light’s speed, but at a later date, after having carefully measured their speed, concluded they did not travel faster than light. Yet, have you ever wondered what lit the earth, prior to the formation of the sun and moon, enabling plant life to exist on the planet? Well it is my belief it was the Holy Spirit (Ruach Ha Kodesh), responsible for the light. The first force was God the Father (Genesis 1:1 and 1:3) and the second force was the Holy Spirit, (light), Genesis 1:2. And it may very well be the Holy Spirit traveled faster than the speed of light, since there was an expansion of the universe. God did not create the sun, moon and stars until Genesis 1:14, yet abundant plant life carpeted the earth’s land mass. Hugh will probably not agree. Although I have been called an heretic for this hypothesis, I believe the following: The Trinity ( 3 separate or interchangeable entities under on Godhead) is similar to Einstein’s theory, E = mc^2 E = Energy (God the Father) m = mass (Jesus Christ, the Son) c = speed of light ^2 (Holy Spirit, the Mother) c in that formula is determined by the speed of the Holy Spirit (perhaps the speed of the Holy Spirit is equal to or faster than the speed of light, and is dependent on the circumstance. Expansion of the universe, as an example, would require the speed of the Holy Spirit to be faster than light’s speed. Father, Mother, and Son are a family unit. God’s desire was for mankind to propagate the earth and to be representative of a family. As well, God stated, Let US make man in OUR image, after OUR likeness in Genesis 1:26. The reference is to God, the Father and the Holy Spirit, the Mother. This is the reason for the “us” and “our.” And the dove is representative of the feminine, so it was the Holy Spirit (the Mother) who stated, as Jesus was being baptized by John, “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” A mother can speak of her son, as well as a father. And further, the Ruach Ha Kodesh is the femine gender in Hebrew, but was translated to “it” and “he” in the Latin and Greek. My conclusion is the Holy Spirit is the Mother and the Holy Ghost is the resurrected Jesus. I believe there was no way to distinguish between spirit (soul or breath) and ghost (apparition) in the Greek, so the words (spirit and ghost) were interchanged erroneously. Referencing the white powder referred to as monoatomic gold, I still believe there is no harm in testing Piero’s theory. I wonder what the molecular structure and the chemical formula of this white powder might be or if a nuclear magnetic spectrum (NMR), or an Infrared spectrum (IR) is available.

You stated, “It might mean that we now have more or less pure Sodium Nitrate, with the odd single gold atom relacing the sodium here and there. At least it explains the white colour. We have reached page 21 and embark on pure alchemy. First we check that a pile of dirt contains no gold. How? Then we mix it with salt, bromide, sulphuric acid and anything else handy and electrolyse it. The result is gold. ***Angel says: Hugh, Hudson’s starting material WAS Gold Chloride (Au Cl3). With respect to Sodium Nitrate, it is highly soluble in water; therefore, Hudson would have rid the crude product of Sodium Nitrate. As a result, some form of gold should still have remained. Hudson’s experimental procedure states, “Thereafter, the just dry material is diluted to 80 ml with deionized water. The solution will have a p H of approximately 1. This step causes the nitrate to dissociate to obtain Na Au in water with a small amount of HNO3 remaining. ***Angel says: Yes, the p H would be 1, because the nitrate is still attached prior to the addition of water. Nitrates are very acidic. So, this step, adding water, dissociates the nitrate and it is indicated a small amount of nitric acid still remains. Therefore, the solution should still be acidic to some degree. And Hudson increased the p H of this acidic solution to neutral p H with Sodium Hydroxide. That is correct.. And then Hudson states, “The Na Au hydrolyzes with the water and dissociates to form H Au. This is also correct, since if Na Au was replaced with Na Cl, after hydrolysis you woud isolate H Cl and Hudson isolated H Au. This step is correct. And then he specifies getting a light grey precipitate of the gold that is hygroscopic (H Au XH2 O). He did not mention how many molecules of water were attached, meaning it varies. The last step Hudson describes,”The monoatomic gold is placed in a porcelain ignition boat and annealed at 300 C under an inert gas to remove hydrogen and to form a very chemically and thermally stable white gold monomer.”. I fail to see where you are getting a pile of dirt on page 21. This is the purification procedure, There is no dirt and there should be at least a gold atom, since Hudson started with gold. There is no alchemy, since Hudson is not creating gold. Hudson started with gold and ended with gold of some form or another (monoatomic gold).

The entire Hudson paper was referencing the different transition metals and d orbitals. And all the nitrates of these metals would be acidic. The reason is the transition metal ion acts like a bronsted acid, and it is for this reason the nitrates are acidic. Copper Nitrate has a p H of 4. Common garden fertilizers do not contain transition metals. I said, “So, this step, adding water, dissociates the nitrate and it is indicated a small amount of nitric acid still remains.” – You replied: What does this mean? There was no acid to start with, and there will be no acid remaining.

This would be the case with any of us, considering Jesus’ remark, “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.” I was reading a Greek Orthodox blog on this subject and I saw these two comments by Mr. Niko T (Greek Orthodox USA) on the subject of Magdalene with demons. Http://www.monachos.net/forum/showthread.php?6721 Mary Magdalene and the seven demons The following life of St. Mary Magdalene in Greek (http://www.impantokratoros.gr/C92 EE7 A9.el.aspx) includes a whole section on the misconception that she was the sinful woman in the Gospel. Here is a pertinent quote from there by St. Modestus of Jerusalem (from a work of his: “On the Myrrhbearers”) and my translation: “Και στον άγιο Μόδεστο, Πατριάρχη Ιεροσολύμων (α’ ήμισυ ζ’ αιώνος) διαβάζομε: «Τον συμβολικό αριθμό επτά και όταν πρόκειται περί της αρετής και όταν πρόκειται περί της κακίας, βλέπομε να χρησιμοποιή η Αγία Γραφή. Ευλόγως, λοιπόν, διαλέγει ο Σωτήρας την Μαρία την Μαγδαληνή, από την οποία εξέβαλε επτά δαιμόνια, για να εκδίωξη μέσω αυτής, τον άρχοντα της κακίας (διάβολο) από την ανθρώπινη φύση. Διότι οι ιστορίες διδάσκουν την Μαγδαληνή αυτήν δια βίου παρθένον. Και αναφέρεται μαρτύριον της Μαρίας Μαγδαληνής, όπου γράφεται ότι για την άκραν παρθενίαν και καθαρότητά της, φαινόταν στους βασανιστές της, σαν καθαρό κρύσταλλο».” “And according to St. Modestus, Patriarch of Jerusalem (1st half of the 7th Century), we read: “The symbolic number seven we see used in the Holy Scriptures indicating virtue and indicating evil. Most likely [Ευλόγως], therefore, it is said that Mary Magdalene, from whom [Christ] cast out seven demons, that the Savior drove out from her the prince of evil (the devil) from the human nature. For the stories teach that this Magdalene was a virgin through her life. And it is mentioned that [at] the martyrdom of Mary Magdalene, as is written, that on account of her utter virginity and purity, she appeared to her torturers, as a pure crystal.” And Niko’s second comment on the subject “The same view is presented on the seven demons by Theophylactos of Bulgaria in his Ermenia on the Gospel according to St. Luke: “As there are seven spirits of virtue thus there are against them seven spirits of evil. As there is a Spirit of fear of God, thus there is against it a Spirit of a lack of fear of God. There is a Spirit understanding, there is against it a Spirit of a lack of understanding, and the same with the rest of them. Unless, therefore these seven spirits of evil leave from the soul, it’s not possible for one to follow Christ. For first Satan must be removed from him, and then Christ will inhabit him.” ***It was mentioned that Mary Magdalene was a virgin. If God has 7 spirits (indicating goodness), then He would necessarily have to cast out 7 demons (indicating evil) on any mortal He may have chosen to be His follower or carry His message. Blinding Paul, on the road to Damascus, might also have been a way of casting out demons or a refining process..","date":"2012-09-24","mins":"4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/19/hot-new-topic-the-wife-of-jesus/","cat":"history","title":"Hot New Topic: The Wife of Jesus"},{"id":"comment-16535","author":"angel","post":"Some scholars believe the papyrus fragment is a forgery.

What about this new angle, referencing the resurrection of Jesus? First, think in terms of Einstein’s “Unified Field Theory,” as opposed to his “Theory of Relativity,” where he attempts to conflate the electromagnetic and gravitational fields into one mathematical reference frame. Next move to Germany’s “The Nazi Bell Project,” and then on to Russia’s, (Dr. Podkletnov’s) experiments on antigravity. Http://gizadeathstar.com/2014/06/update podkletnovs antigravity research high octane speculations/ And then fast forward to Lockheed Martin’s antigravity discoid spaceship with onboard laser technology, X 22 A. The “A” stands for antigravity. Yet, there was the denial of Lockheed that they were NOT working on such a spacecraft. And finally Boeing’s admittance in the research and development of antigravity (notice the use of the word “may in the statement below.” “It is also possible, Boeing admits, that “classified activities in gravity modification may exist”. Http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1064.htm And finally Obama’s “GRASP” briefing (see following statement). Remember Russia’s Dr. Podkletnov mentioned earlier? “The GRASP briefing document reveals that BAE Systems and Lockheed Martin have also contacted Podkletnov “and have some activity in this area”. The Lockheed X 22 A space disc uses antigravity technology, avoiding radar, and is able to disappear and then re appear in the sky. With all this in mind, I believe Jesus used “antigravity” when He resurrected. And for this reason, (controlling gravity), He was able to appear, (entering through the wall) to visit the disciples after the resurrection and then disappear after His visitation. This is a wild and crazy theory, Colin, but I believe electromagnetism (Einstein’s Unified Field Theory) was utilized by Jesus at the resurrection, allowing Him to control gravity, as He left the tomb without a trace.

Since both the Shroud and Sudarium predate the artists or sculptors who might have been capable of this type of forgery, like Da Vinci, then I stand by my comment. Even Da Vinci who was a master of anatomy, would not have painted an image that appears somewhat distorted. What WOULD explain the distortion of the Shroud image is a physical change in the body of Jesus at the point of resurrection or His transformation from matter to the Holy Spirit (the bright, white spiritual body that confronted Mary Magdalene).

Blood experiments determined the AB blood type on both cloths and the spots aligned perfectly. . Remember too, there were 70 points of coincidence and each of the cloths contained pollen from Jerusalem. If the Sudarium has been in Spain since approximately 745 AD (BCE) and it was C 14 dated to the 7th century by Professor Baima Bollone (although he could not vouch for the test’s validity), how is it possible the Turin Shroud covered de Molay or was the genius of Da Vinci?

The reaction mixture turned to a beautiful burgundy color and the entire test tube filled with golden threads. I actually thought I had synthesized gold. Yet, it was just some side product that had crystallized out as long golden needles. My chemistry professor, when I told him about my experiment and how I had synthesized gold, had a good laugh. Yet, after seeing so many accidents in the chemistry labs, as a result of someone heating a closed system, or instead of adding water to acid (dropwise and slowly), the person added acid to the water too quickly. I had a German professor that punched one of the male students in the back, when the student, in error, added 10 m L of concentrated hydrochloric acid to 100 m L of water as a bolus (all at once).

The reason I ask is your photo, detailing the melting of the polyethylene container, sends out a red flag. As a rule, polyethylene containers are used (when an ice bath is required) for the purpose of cooling down an exothermic reaction (in an Erlenmeyer flask) as an example. The flask, containing the heated reaction mixture is placed into either ice or dry ice that is held in the polythene dish (container). Pyrex is always used for reactions that give off heat (exothermic), especially when there is a chance of a runaway reaction. This appears to be the case in your photo, evidenced by the melted container. Yet, I’m not certain if you realize, polyethylene (polythene) also contains phthalates (plasticizers) that ameliorate the physical properties.

Both hypotheses seem plausible. As well, too much credit is given to the medieval artists/forgerers.

Even Da Vinci was not that thorough. And how would a medieval artist know to place AB blood type on both the Shroud and Sudarium?

Notice all three results include the “K” haplogroup. Only one haplogroup (K) and not several.

I would guess that few people in the world are so “pure blooded” as to have only a single haplotype. I guess that when we are investigating the closeness of our relationship to somebody else, only a single haplotype need be investigated, as long as it is present in both people. Maybe somebody who knows what he is talking about could clarify? ***Angel says: Hi, Hugh. Thank you, but only one haplogroup is assigned to mt DNA (maternal line) and only one to YDNA (paternal line). I used my mt DNA K (Katrine clan) as an example. When you say we are closely related to other people, well that is true. In my case, K (Katrine) haplogroup is the daughter of U (Ursula), as an example. Therefore, my ancestors would go back beyond Katrine to Ursula’s line (U haplogroup) and Ursula’s line goes back to Africa (L haplogroup). All separated by thousands of years. Yet, these other groups, in my example Katrine, are pre Katrine. There is only one final haplogroup for the mother’s line and one for the father’s line. In my case, the ancestors of K are U and the ancestors of U are L, but I am not assigned to all three (K, U and L) , but only K. I suspect, since the DNA of Jesus (Shroud) was fragmented, the genetic scientists were unable to definitely determine His final haplogroup (FTDNA), and if one of His markers indicated Ursula (U) then U was included as a haplogroup, and if another of His markers indicated Africa, then L was included as a haplogroup and for this reason, there are both numerous haplogroups and subclades assigned to the TS mt DNA. Garza Valdez included mt DNA data only up to marker 263, where my refined mt DNA dat is in the multi thousands. As well, it matters not which genetic organization performs the DNA testing, all will give the same result for the final haplogroup and subclade. This link shows a photo of how everyone’s ancestors go back to Africa as well as the expansion times (years ago). Http://www.worldfamilies.net/mtdnahaporigins This is such an interesting field of study, but as a rule no one cares unless he/she has had his/her own personal DNA performed. There are even DNA forums, where people from each of the various haplogroups and subclades discuss their common ancestry (Vikings, Kazars, etc.). The price has come down a lot and many times these genetic testing companies have sales on their services. I paid separately for HVR1, HVR2 and finally FTDNA, but if anyone here chooses to have his or her DNA done, don’t pay separately for all three. Just pay a little more, when there is a sale, for the refined test (FTDNA). This test will include the other two. Kelly Kearse may be able to clarify the results on the TS DNA. Thanks again, Hugh.

With the Bose Einstein condensates (BE Cs), superconductivity usually occurs at temperatures approaching absolute zero on the Kelvin scale. These are the low temperature superconductors. Now scientists have isolated high temp superconductors and recently room temperature superconductors (graphene). Please note, there is a difference between ionizing radiation (electron positron annihilation) and non ionizing radiation (laser light). Both forms of radiation are harmful I, since they are carcinogenic and can damage the DNA chain. However, laser light (small doses/pulses) can also be helpful too, since it is used to repair skin and/or eye damage.

In Jewish thought and literature, as well as in the nuances of the Hebrew language itself, is revealed an understanding of the personage and character of the Ruach Ha Kadosh that has for the most part been lost through translation and introduction of pagan influences into the assembly. Lost to everybody, that is, except the Jews and others learned in the Torah, and in the Hebrew language of Scripture. The Ruach is simply the femine manifestation of YHWH! Let’s begin by first stating that Hebrew, like many languages of the earth, contain both feminine and masculine tenses. The tense of the word determining the gender of the noun being described. For example, in Spanish “muchacho” means boy, and “muchacha” means girl. The “o” at the end of muchacho defining masculine tense, and the “a” at the end of muchacha defining feminine tense. In Hebrew, the word “Ruach” is feminine tense, assigning to the Spirit a feminine nature, character, gender. But when a tense (male or female) is in reference to a life form, then the tense is in reference to the “gender” of the life form. Since we know the Ruach to be a conscious, living being, the manifested power of YHWH capable of leading us, guiding us, and of instructing and teaching us in the Way of all truth; Yochanan 14:26, Luka 12;12; we can determine from the tense of the Hebrew and Aramaic words that the Ruach Ha Kadosh is feminine tense, and therefore, “female in gender. This point is entirely lost in the Greek which has no feminine tense for spirit, but only a neuter tense, which is why “Spirit” is always presented as a “He” in the Greek (neuter words are given male attributes in translation), which error has been erroneously transferred over into the English. In the Aramaic the word for Spirit is Feminine as well with the word Ruacha axwr, confirming the Hebrew understanding of the word Ruaah or …” ## I tried to include the link, but this site is not working.

Excerpt from the article – link below: “Part of the problem we have with the New Testament is that the one used by the Western Churches is a Greek translation of the original Hebrew, a language evolved within a pagan context as opposed to the Hebrew of the Old Testament which was, we believe, the original divine language and which evolved within the context of a divine theocracy (Israel). This means, in our opinion, that Hebrew is more precise and inspired than Greek. Moreover, we have good reason to believe that most, if not all, the New Testament was originally written in Hebrew and subsequently translated into Greek. Therefore in terms of defining the gender of the Holy Spirit, New Covenant Christians are more disposed to the Hebrew Old and New Testament witness of the Bible which overwhelmingly reveals the Holy Spirit to be feminine. English has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter (i.e. He, she and it). Hebrew and Aramaic have no neuter gender. In Hebrew and Aramaic everything is either a “he” or a “she” and nothing is an “it”. Also gender plays a much more important role in Hebrew and in Aramaic than in English. In English gender is usually only an issue when dealing with pronouns. But in Hebrew and Aramaic nouns and verbs are also maculine or feminine. And while there are no true adjectives in Hebrew (nouns are also used as adjectives), noun modifiers must agree in gender with the noun. Now the Hebrew word RUACH (Aramaic RUCHA) is gramatically feminine as is the phrase Ruach ha Kodesh. This is matched by the rôle of the Ruach ha Kodesh as “comforter” (Jn.14 16) and the identifier of the “comforter” with YHWH acting as a “mother” (Is.66:13). It is very clear that the gender of the RUACH has been revised in many passages of the Aramaic to agree with the Hellenistic concept of the Holy Spirit as being either a he” or an “it”.

I had a vision of Genesis, where the Holy Spirit was walking through the trees in the Garden of Eden. I saw a long grey, silky type skirt with an ivory/beige brocade detail around the waist band of the skirt, in the shape of a wide or elongated “V.” I was standing on the ground and I could see the Holy Spirit’s shoes and ankles and the hem of the skirt. I looked up so that I could see the face of the Holy Spirit, and no matter how far up I looked, I was never able to see the face. The waistband of the skirt was at sky level and I was standing on the ground. So, the upper part of the Holy Spirit was beyond the sky. Therefore, in my vision, the Holy Spirit was female. After this I made an attempt to find some scriptural verification of this fact. I could find nothing in the Canon, so I looked at “The Gospel of Philip” and I noticed one particular passage that verified what I had seen. Philip stated the following: “Those who believe Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit are in error. When did a woman ever conceive of a woman?” Therefore, I believe Jesus helped me to see the light, in this case, and the vision settled the fact the Holy Spirit was female, at least, to my mind. I was watching the Sunday morning talk shows a few weeks ago and one of the panel referred to the Holy Spirit as a “He,” and Cokie Roberts quickly corrected him by stating “She.” Therefore, word must be getting around in other circles, as well, the Holy Spirit is a “She.” Yet, I can see your point in regard to your mother tongue and the various languages you speak.

Spirits do not have gender as gendernis just there for procreation necessity. Spirits do not procreate, therefore they do not NEED gender” ***Angel says: “God’s purpose was procreation, where the male and female (Adam and Eve) were directed by God to populate the earth. (‘Be fruitful and multiply’). While God, the Father, is Energy, the Holy Spirit, the Mother, is Light, Jesus, the Son is representative of God’s intent on earth for mankind, the family unit. I am not stating God is a physical man and the Holy Spirit is a physical woman. My vision showed the Holy Spirit was the female aspect of God and this is why no matter how high up I looked, I was never able to see the upper half, or the face, of the Holy Spirit. The vision was meant only to show the Holy Spirit was the female aspect.” Excerpt: “GOD IS FEMALE TOO! There is a female aspect of God that has equal standing with the male aspect of God. God has many names and titles which, when understood, shed light upon His nature and also upon His purposes in creation. EL SHADDAI (fem.) is translated ‘Almighty God’ in most versions. The actual meaning of the Hebrew words, when translated, is THE MANY BREASTED ONE or THE FULL BREASTED ONE depicting the maternal ability to feed, succour and enfold each new life. By contrast, JAHWEH(or Jehovah) is the ‘Father Image’ and one can readily see the commanding figure that such a name produces as He gives His no nonsense directions, deals with enemies and also knows how to spank the wayward to bring them back into line! God made a spiritual man (Gen.1) out of Himself in the Image and Likeness of Himself. The Hebrew word for ‘image’ is masculine in gender, while the word for ‘likeness’ is feminine. When God formed man of the dust of the earth, he was made up of both male and female parts. This readily seen when God later separated these two parts. The Hebrew word TSELAH, translated rib’ in the KJV, actually means FLANK, SIDE, HALF. God brought Adam’s other half to him and declared,t hey shall be one flesh (Gen.2:24). . . No longer duality TSELAH flank has the same root meaning in Hebrew as does ‘image’. As God created male and female, He placed both soul and spirit in each human vessel. Thus we could put ‘image’ as the male — spirit and ‘likeness’ as the female — soul. God called their name Adam (Gen. 5:1). Adam later declared that Eve was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. If she was just a ‘rib’, then he could only have said, Bone of my bone.” http://www.godfire.net/rayknight/70 Male Female.pdf Therefore, when God created man in OUR image and OUR likeness He was referring to His male and female aspect, soul and spirit. And Adam and Eve (male and female) were representative of the “flesh” or body of mankind. As a result, male and female were created with the purpose of being representative of both soul and spirit (God, the Father, Holy Spirit, the Mother) and the flesh, the mortal body (Adam and Eve).

The book of Daniel, as an example, contains prophetic metaphor and Revelation is purely symbolical. Jesus used the parables to insure the important points of His message were received and comprehended by even the least intelligent of His followers. And all people understood the “Ten Commandments” were the laws of God. As well, Jesus expanded on these laws with the two great commandments, ” Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength” and”Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself” It matters not whether one is able to interpret the metaphor or symbolism that exists in many of the books of the bible, since following God’s commandments alone is what is required for mankind’s salvation and the eternal kingdom.

For certain there have been omissions, deletions, insertions and presumptions, specifically by Pope Gregory, who propagated a theory Mary Magdalene was a prostitute, despite this not being recorded in either of the four Gospels. Yet, a major portion of the Bible is God’s word and was meant to be easily understood by the masses and taken literally. God would not have encrypted His word to mankind. And if the word of God was altered by man, God would still reveal his intent to those who follow Him, without doubt, through visions and dreams, as He did with Abraham, Daniel, Joseph and Moses. Jesus stated in Matthew 11:25, “I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou has hidden these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes.” Therefore, whether some or a majority of the Bible is metaphor, God will still reveal its meaning to the faithful through dreams and visions.

I see your point, but with respect to Jesus’ age, I gathered this information from a site a few years ago, similar to the site I linked. Using historical data on the site I visited, the age of Jesus was calculated to be about 42 years. Here is an example, although this is not the site I saw originally. Yet, the man on the TS surely looks to be in his 40s, not 30s. Historical Data “The best way to date the death of Christ is to look for the key players in his death drama, about whom there is considerable information, and to establish the context surrounding Jesus’ death. We begin by acknowledging that Jesus’ death followed the death of John the Baptist, and occurred while Caiaphas*was High Priest and while Pilate*was Prefect. We*have reason to believe*that John the Baptist met his gruesome death in 35 A.D.*[1], Caiaphas was deposed by Lucius Vitellius, the legate of Syria, in 36 A.D. And Pilate was recalled to Rome at the end of 36 A.D [2]. Ipso facto, Jesus must have been crucified in the year 36 A.D. Having been born in 6 B.C. And having died in 36 A.D. Means that Jesus was in his 40s when he died, probably 42 years old. * The Gospel Record * Further proof that Jesus was in his 40s when he died comes directly from the Gospel of John. Jesus is discussing the destruction of the temple and he says: ‘Destroy this temple, and in 3 days I will raise it up.’ The Jews then said, ‘This temple has been under construction for 46 years, and you will raise it up in 3 days?’ But he was speaking of the temple of his body (John 2:20 21).’ John points out that later, when he is crucified, Jesus’ disciples remembered his prophecy of the 3 days; however, no one seems to recall the 46 years. Taken at his word, Jesus is clearly saying that he is 46 years old, and that when he dies, he will resurrect in 3 days. If Jesus was 46 years old when he died in 36 A.D., it means he was born in 10 B.C., which is theoretically possible, although 6 B.C. Is a more probable date. * We find further proof that Jesus is in his 40s from the Gospel of John. Jesus is in a Temple, close to the Mount of Olives, talking to the Scribes*and Pharisees. The subject turns to Abraham, and the ‘Jews’ ask Jesus: ‘You are not yet 50 years old, and have you seen Abraham? (8:57).’Jesus answers: ‘…before Abraham was, I am’, but the important thing to observe here is that the questioners describe Jesus as not yet being 50. Were he in his 20s or 30s, they would have chosen a different year, but by saying that he is not yet 50, they clearly identify him as being in his forties. * Other Christian Sources * The noted Christian Irenaeus*(130 202 A.D.) in Against Heresforc* �gainsins7�D.) ind have you inple of his bodeo old when he died. * All this evidence shows a significant divergence from the commonly accepted idea that Jesus was in his 30s when he died. All three methods indicate Jesus died in his 40s, between 42 and 46. It also suggests that Jesus’ ministry was significantly longer than the 1 to 3 bodeo that are traditionally attributed to it, because if he began his ministry when he was about 30, and he died between 42 and 46, his ministry was 12 or more years, not 1 or 3.” httpins//www.biblewheel.com/forum/showthread.phpin F1071 Date of Jesus Crucifixion Best..","date":"2013-05-10","mins":"7:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"id":"comment-33561","author":"angel","post":"Thank you, Luis.

He declared, “The text is of the most far reaching significance because it shows that whatever group was responsible for these writings was operating in the same general scriptural and Messianic framework of early Christianity.” Although the original scroll team still claimed that there was no evidence about early Christianity in the unpublished scrolls, this new scroll totally contradicted their statements.

John 8:58 “Jesus said unto them “Verily I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM. Now John 8:58 may very well be Jesus referring to His appearance as Melchizedek speaking to Abram.

I referenced an age of 42 (early 40s) and gave you a link to the research of Dr. Molnar, who is a Physicist and Astronomer. Yet, there is also the difference in the Gregorian calendar vs. The Jewish calendar. As has been noted: “The Gregorian calendar was an attempt to begin the new date (A.D.) based upon the year that Jesus was born. In the end, the calculation was incorrect by a number of years due to missed historical facts. It is now known that Herod the Great died in the year 4 B.C. Since he was alive when Jesus was born, that already puts Christ’s birth earlier than the year 4 B.C. And not A.D. 1. Furthermore, we also know from Matthew two that Jesus was two years old at the time the wisemen and Herod met. If we put these things together, we can determine that Jesus was born between 7 and 6 B.C., which is why the Gregorian calendar is off by that many years.” http://www.ariel.org/qna/qjewcal.htm?iframe=true& RECOVERED CUNIFORM SCRIPT “This leads to consideration of a series of prior astrological events that occurred in 7 BCE. Four copies of an ancient Babylonian astronomical text, written in 8 BCE in cuneiform script on clay tablets, have been recovered.

And unfortunately, without actual proof, nothing is set in stone. Yet, even though gnostic text has been excluded from the Canon, if an archaeological dig unearthed an ancient gnostic text that detailed the Shroud of Turin as originating in 1 BC, the fact it was gnostic scripture would be conveniently ignored and would be used as proof of the shroud’s authenticity.

If you recall, there were three men in the OT who visited Abraham, two were angels, who went ahead to save Lot and his family and the third man was God in the flesh (Jesus) who continued on to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. Yes, it is for these reasons, when Jesus was questioned by the Phaisees and they stated to Him, “You are not yet 50 years of age and you have seen Abraham?” Jesus replied, “Before Abraham was, I AM.” “I AM” not only references the name of God (I AM that I AM) in the Old Testament, but Jesus’ reply to the Pharisees, “Before Abraham was, I AM” can also be read as, standing before Abraham…was I AM. The Jews may not have considered Jesus as the suffering servant in Isaiah 53, but the passage represented both the suffering servant and Jesus’ fulfillment of the suffering servant. For this reason Jesus cleaned the disciples feet, making the statement to the disciples that He was here as a servant, not a master. Prophecy (OT) and Fulfillment (NT) What was prophesied in the Old Testament was fulfilled by Jesus in the New Testament. God in the flesh (Jesus) was there from the beginning (OT) and He will be here at the end (NT). This fact was verified by the statement Jesus made, “I am alpha and omega, the beginning and the end.”.","date":"2015-07-21","mins":"9:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/17/a-reflection-on-the-shroud-and-zechariah/","cat":"article","title":"A Reflection on the Shroud and Zechariah"},{"id":"comment-206346","author":"angel","post":"There are prophecies in the Old Testament (aside from Isaiah 53) that predict Jesus as the Messiah.

I’m not as qualified as you guys. I don’t hold a Ph D and as a matter of fact, I only have 6 graduate credits toward my Master’s Degree. I had to drop out of the graduate program when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, followed by my father’s liver cancer. Yet, I’ve achieved quite a bit for someone who didn’t have a Ph D, like Colin or you. I was in line for another patent on a neuromuscular blocking drug, but our company was sold, prior to patent issue. That really hurt, since I had worked on that particular compound for such a long period of time, in an effort to reduce the duration of the drug. Although Colin’s experiments may seem ridiculous to a person not familiar with scientific technique, all avenues leading to image formation on the Shroud must be explored and for this reason alone, I give credit to and appreciate the effort Colin Berry has expended, referencing his research methodology. I may be incorrect, but I seem to recall either a documentary or a DVD on the “Event Horizon” that introduced Isabel Piczek as both an artist and a particle physicist. When I posted this information on an Amazon atheist site, in defence of the Shroud and Jesus, as God, all the scientists on that forum informed me Isabel Piczek was not a physicist, since they had thoroughly researched her background. As well these scientists asked me to link them to Isabel’s university credentials. I couldn’t find that specific information on the internet. Those scientists, who are atheists, can be extremely brutal at times and even today, they not only refer to the Shroud as the MIT (Magic Italian Tablecloth) but they trumpeti the work of Garlaschelli. And since they don’t believe Jesus existed at all (there’s no historical record) they have come to the conclusion the entire biblical story was merely fantasy. It’s hurtful for a true believer to read such negative comments, concerning Jesus. For this reason I am hoping scientists will either find some archaeological evidence for His existence or perform a novel type of scientific test on the Shroud that proves, without a doubt, the linen cloth dates to the first century. Regarding non scientists, my belief is anyone is capable of presenting an hypothesis that eventually proves fruitful, in respect to the image on the Shroud. It really matters not whether he or she is a scientist or not. :).","date":"2015-08-18","mins":"11:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/16/colin-berrys-long-running-investigation-of-the-shroud/","cat":"article","title":"Colin Berry’s Long Running Investigation of the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-208579","author":"angel","post":"Doc Andy, I appreciate the information you have included in your post; however, I need something that is completely factual, with no ambiquity or possible Christian insertions into the text that is proof positive and serves as an historical record of Jesus’ existence.

We all live in corruptible bodies on this earth, but even with our corruptible bodies, we should still be able to choose between God and money. A condensed version of what Jesus stated on this subject is we are all given the choice to worship either God or mammon. Yet, we should never fail to remember, the one we choose becomes our God. When Jesus made the remark, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s, I believe He was stating, we should use money to pay bills, taxes, etc., but we should call on the name of God the Father for or food, clothing, shelter and other necessities. Jesus confirmed this when He spoke, concerning the clothing of the lilies of the field. This statement signifies God the Father, if asked, will take care of our basic needs (food, clothing, shelter).

Those that denounce God, by not obeying His laws or denying His existence, do this only to rationalize their own bad behavior.

We’re ALL spitirually sick (meaning sinners). It’s like the lost sheep or the prodigal son. On the spiritual level, we’re ALL this lost sheep and we’re ALL this prodigal son. ***Yes, we are all sinners and none of us are righteous, but we are NOT lost sheep. We’ve heard the word of God and we may either keep it or denounce it. Of the 99 sheep, only one was lost. So, those in the most remote places of the world may be considered lost, since they have not been exposed to the Gospel of Jesus. You are not lost, because you have heard His word. Why did Jesus state to the Pharisees, “You did not recognize the time of your visitation?” Jesus made this statement, because the Pharisees had seen the miracles Jesus worked and still denounced Him. Since no one in the world is righteous and all of us have sinned, we are to repent and ask forgiveness for our sins. This was preached by not only John the Baptist, but Jesus and His disciples, as well. The majority of us are NOT lost. We know Jesus’ preachings and we know what we must do when we have sinned. The choice is ours alone. The determining factors, concerning the Kingdom, center on humility and arrogance, love and hate, money worship and spiritual worship. Those who denounce Jesus and His message, worship money over God and are greedy and hateful are labeled cursed and arrogant. Those who are lowly in heart, poor in spirit, love their neighbor and follow Jesus’ words (as sheep follow the shepherd), are considered blessed and humble. There is a difference in the two, like the thieves on the cross. If it were not so, there would be no reason for Jesus to separate the sheep from the goats. For we’d all be sheep.

Secondly, since Jews were traditionally interred with burial clothes, is he trying to convince us that Jesus was buried without any burial cloths in order that his interpretation carries weight? Apparently so, which is just downright stupid.” Angel replied: Pilate washed his hands, so the blood of Jesus would not fall upon him. Pilate did not believe Jesus was worthy of death and ordered the sign “King of the Jews” be placed on the cross. The Jews were adamently opposed to this sign, yet Pilate, in direct opposition to the Jews stated, “What I have written, I have written.” With this in mind, Pilate released the body of Jesus to Joseph of Arimathea, the rich man, with knowledge that Jesus would have a proper burial. As to the comments on the burial clothes of Jesus, I believe in the “Word of God,” but have found mistranslations, in a few New Testament scriptures that were translated from the original Hebrew, Greek and Latin into English. Just recently, I purchased a copy of “The Jewish New Testament” (Translation by David H. Stern), where the original Jewishness is clearly expressed within its pages. In this New Testament Jewish translation, the versions of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, concerning the linen and how the body was wrapped are detailed. The first two books, Matthew and Mark show the following: Matthew: 27: 57 59 “wrapped it in a clean linen sheet. Mark: 15: 45 46 “he wrapped him in a linen sheet. (referring to Joseph) ***Yet, both versions, Matthew and Mark, fail to mention the “linen sheet” upon the disciples’ entrance into the tomb after the resurrection. Luke and John read as follows: Luke: 23:53 “wrapped it in a linen sheet. (referring to Joseph) John: 19:40 “wrapped it up in linen sheets.” (referring to Joseph and Nicodemus) After the resurrection, on entering the tomb, Luke: 24:12 Stooping down, he saw only the burial clothes. (referring to Peter) John: 20:5 The other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. Stooping down, he saw the linen burial sheets lying there, but did not go in. In conclusion, Luke’s version started with a linen sheet (singular) and ended with burial clothes (plural). And John’s version started with wrapped in linen sheets and ended with linen burial sheets. Yet three books, Matthew, Mark and Luke clearly indicate Jesus was initially wrapped in a single linen sheet (sindone). And the burial clothes (plural) in Luke, after the resurrection, may refer to the single linen sheet and head napkin. This would account for the plural (burial clothes) outlined in Luke. Obviously, according to the Hebrew translation, Jesus was given a traditional burial..","date":"2012-09-23","mins":"3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/23/downright-stupid-analysis-in-the-empty-tomb-jesus-beyond-the-grave/","cat":"books","title":"Downright Stupid Analysis  in The Empty Tomb: Jesus Beyond the Grave"},{"id":"comment-16873","author":"angel","post":"Louis, I agree with you.

The Smithsonian Channel is planning to debut a program about it at end of the month. Text on the papyrus fragment, written in the language of early Egyptian Christians, records Jesus referring to a woman, Mary, as “my wife,” and later saying, “She can be my disciple.” ***Even if the papyrus was authentic, the translation never mentioned which of the Marys was his wife. Jesus also loved Mary of Bethany, the sister of Lazarus, and there were three Marys at the cross; Mary the Mother, Mary wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene. By eliminating Mary the mother and Mary the wife of Clopas, only Mary Magdalene and Mary of Bethany remain. Jesus loved both of the remaining two Marys. Why are people assuming the wife in the papyrus was Mary Magdalene and not Mary of Bethany? This is how falsehoods originate.

Hope you are well. I have a question. There are many who believed Ron Wyatt was a fake, but I do not believe this to be the case. Although Ron is now deceased, what is interesting is that he found the cross hole where Jesus was crucified and digging beneath the cross hole into Zedekiah’s cave, he supposedly found the Mercy Seat (altar) that contained dried blood. Isn’t it strange that the blood Ron attributed to Jesus had 24 chromosomes (XXY), same as that of the Shroud? Here is an excerpt of someone familiar with DNA analysis, referencing the blood Wyatt found. A Scientist Analyzes Mr. Wyatt’s Chromosome Theory Dr. Eugene Dunkley, Geneticist August 1999, England “Ron was convinced that the blood of the altar was in fact the divine blood of Jesus because the chromosome count was 24. If Jesus was ONLY human we would expect 46. In fact, if he found 46 chromosomes I would have my doubts, because the argument would be that it was simply the blood of a human being (except of course that the white blood cells were re vitalized after almost 2000 years….). Russell is wrong about the frequency of chromosomal diseases in humans: a number of conditions involving either 47 or 45 chromosomes have been well characterized, besides Turner’s, such as, Klinefelters, Down’s syndrome, Pateau’s syndrome, Cri de Chat syndrome, XYY, XXY, etc. And in fact there was a case in which a young man was found alive with only 24 chromosomes.” http://www.arkdiscovery.com/chromosomes.htm My question is Ron found this blood, before the Shroud DNA analysis. Why are the results, (XXY chromosome) exactly as that found on the Shroud of Turin? See also the photos of Zedekiah’s cave where Ron found the blood.
