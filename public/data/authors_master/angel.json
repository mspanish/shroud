All the broad lines on both sides of the head project outward from the shoulder, clearly indicating the broad lines are hair.  Therefore, on both sides of the head the hair is symmetrcal and falls to the shoulder.\nThe artist failed to include the Trinity (3) blood spot above the left eyebrow, evidenced on the negative of the Shroud image, just to the right of the nose.

If Jesus rubbed his face on the Edessa cloth and gave it to King Abgar for healing, then why would the Edessa cloth have the blood “3” at the forehead and also the blood spots intermingled through Jesus’ hair?  This blood should not have been on the Edessa cloth, as Jesus was alive when he sent the cloth to King Abgar for healing.\nWith that in mind, the “Edessa Cloth,” (King Abgar) had to be pressed to Jesus’ face, either after his death or on the road to the cross; otherwise there would be no visible blood on the  Edessa cloth image.  And there does appear to be the blood “3” above the left eyebrow on the Edessa cloth and a few blood spots in the hair.\nThere must be another cloth, still not found, that would have been used for King Abgar’s healing and this must be the cloth used as a model for the coin.

He performed the blood studies on the Shroud.\nI distinctly remember Dr. Adler stating.  “I am so good in my field that had the shroud not been exposed to a flood, causing water damage, I could have told you if Jesus was circumcized or not.”  Obviously, he was referring to that private area.\nWith that in mind, some researchers have stated DNA studies determined a trisomy (XXY) on the sex chromosome, indictative of Kleinfelter Syndrome, while other scientific researchers determined this chromosome to be XX with a Y embedded into one of the Xs or de la Chapelle Syndrome, referred to as XX male.\nFurther, I have read de la Chapelle mimics Kleinfelter and, as well, de la Chapelle syndrome is often misdiagnosed.\nRegardless, as to what is finally determined (Kleinfelter Syndrome or de la Chapelle Syndrome), the salient feature of both are female traits in the male.\nNow, observe the full body image of the Shroud of Turin and then look closely at the upper portion of the body and  then compare this image to the  image posted on this site (link below) \nComment Promoted: The Stavronikita Epitaphios\nhttps://shroudstory.com/2014/06/28/comment-promoted-the-stavronikita-epitaphios/#comment-134352\nNow compare the two images mentioned above to that of the Hungarian Pray Codex.\nAs a woman, I am clearly able to see female breasts on all three images, indicating either Kleinfelter Syndrome (XXY) or  de la Chapelle Syndrome, (XX male).\nMen diagnosed with Kleinfelter Syndrome are very tall, as a rule, and have female breasts. Jesus was tall, compared to other Jewish males, at that time.\nI realize, as well, most believe Ron Wyatt was a fake, but surprisingly, back in the 70s or 80s, he found blood beneath the cross hole, after engineering a a dig into Zedekiah’s cave  and supposedly, he had that black blood reconstituted and scientifically analyzed.  The lab  analysis also revealed the trisomy XXY.  This study was done prior to any of the more recent studies on the sex chromosomes.\nFinally concluding, what are your thoughts concerning the relationship of female traits, found in men with an extra X chromosome, to the three images I’ve mentioned in the paragraphs above?\nAre you clearly able to see what appears obvious to me or do I need an opthalmologist?  :) \nAnd if you are able to make the connection of the female traits on the shroud image to the other images, would you consider this to be a type of proof, considering sex chromosome studies verify the images?    \nThanks in advance.\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 30, 2014 at 4:57 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"angel","post":"P.S.

Here is an excerpt:\n “Don’t you think the blood on the Shroud seems too red to be so old?”\n‘When a person is cruelly tortured, the blood undergoes a terrible haemolysis, when the haemaglobin literally ‘breaks up’. In thirty seconds, the reaction reaches the liver, which doesn’t have time to deal with it, and discharges a volume of bilirubin into the veins.

This was a Roman, not a Jewish, custom. The hands were tied high to a tree or post. A whip was made of a short wood handle and heavy leather straps bearing usually the sharp bones of sheep knuckles or lead balls on the ends. \nThe Jews forbade more than forty lashes (thirty nine was the maximum allowed), but the Romans did not have this limit. The scourging was usually carried out by a Roman soldier. The whip was brought down upon the bare back, cutting the skin first; then as the beating \fprogressed, the muscles were laid bare, bruised and bleeding with marked loss of blood. In a significant number of instances this was enough to kill a man. Ribs were broken, nerves exposed. Again and again, down came the whip until either death or unconsciousness occurred. Both venous and arterial bleeding occurred. Large deep, dark, bruised surfaces began to appear. Finally the skin of the back is hanging in long shreds. The whole area is an unrecognizable mass of torn, bleeding tissue.”\nhttp://www.churches-of-christ.net/tracts/job004u.htm\nHere is an image of the flagrum that was used on Jesus’ scourging.  Note the metal balls attached to the leather whip.\nhttp://www.indyprops.com/pp-flagrum.htm\nTherefore, a massive blood loss from 60 lashes would be an understatement.

When iron is deoxygenated, Iron (II) the blood appears as a dark red color.  When blood hemoglobin is oxygen rich, Iron (III) the blood is then seen as bright red in color.  Now, there may be a difference with aged-blood, such as Otzi’s or the TS blood, or the way it was preserved over time.\nPerhaps, and this is only an opinion, the Shroud was kept in a sealed casket for decades, and then when it was taken out for public viewing, and exposed to air, the color became a brighter red. I don’t believe the Otzi mummy was placed in a vacuum-type environment, but he was preserved in ice.   \nAnother thought came to mind.

In other words, the person would have lost so much blood he would go into shock. The results of this would be\n1) The heart would race to pump blood that was not there.\n2) The victim would collapse or faint due to low blood pressure.\n3) The kidneys would shut down to preserve body fluids.\n4) The person would experience extreme thirst as the body desired to replenish lost fluids.\nThere is evidence from Scripture that Jesus experienced hypovolemic shock as a result of being flogged. As Jesus carried His own cross to Golgotha (John 19:17), He collapsed, and a man named Simon was forced to either carry the cross or help Jesus carry the cross the rest of way to the hill (Matthew 27:32–33; Mark 15:21–22; Luke 23:26). This collapse indicates Jesus had low blood pressure. Another indicator that Jesus suffered from hypovolemic shock was that He declared He was thirsty as He hung on the cross (John 19:28), indicating His body’s desire to replenish fluids.\nPrior to death, the sustained rapid heartbeat caused by hypovolemic shock also causes fluid to gather in the sack around the heart and around the lungs. This gathering of fluid in the membrane around the heart is called pericardial effusion, and the fluid gathering around the lungs is called pleural effusion. This explains why, after Jesus died and a Roman soldier thrust a spear through Jesus’ side (probably His right side, piercing both the lungs and the heart), blood and water came from His side just as John recorded in his Gospel (John 19:34).\nhttp://www.gotquestions.org/blood-water-Jesus.html\nAnd below is an excerpt on the subject of the blood and water.\n“One view concerns the pericardium, the sac which surrounds the heart, and which contains a small amount of watery fluid. When the body undergoes great stress, as crucifixion would certainly entail, the amount of fluid increases and the sac expands. The Roman lance would then have passed through Jesus’ pericardium and into the right side of his heart, which is filled with blood even after death. As the lance was withdrawn, it would draw out the blood from the heart and the watery fluid from the expanded pericardium.”\nAnd there is a second view is as follows;\n“Anthony Sava, an American physician, has a different explanation for the water flow. He believes that the severe scourging caused internal hemorrhaging in Jesus’ chest, and the pleural cavity filled with blood. The blood settled on the bottom of the chest cavity while a clear liquid was left on top. Sava says that the Roman lance entered the chest and, upon being withdrawn, released the blood and the water from the chest.” \nEither of the two views gave the conclusion:\nThe explanations for the blood and water flow are closely related at several points. All physicians who have examined the question agree that Jesus was already dead when the chest wound was inflicted. The blood and water most probably flowed from both the heart and the chest cavity. \nhttp://www.godonthe.net/evidence/forensic.htm \nBest,\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 5:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse"},{"author":"angel","post":"jesterof, your comments indicate you may also be of the opinion prisoners who are beaten with a rubber hose, do not experience internal bleeding.\nI disagree with your assessment, but that doesn’t mean I do not respect your opinion.\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 5:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse"},{"author":"angel","post":"jesterof, the coagulation cascade to which you refer does not occur in persons who have esophageal varicies and the condition is life threatening, as well.\nI’m not stating Jesus had esophageal varices, but this is one case, a result of cirrhosis of the liver, where bleeding does not stop of its own accord.\nBest,\n\n","date":"June 13, 2013 at 5:46 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/a-guest-posting-ten-questions-for-alan-adler-by-kelly-kearse/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"A Guest Posting: Ten Questions for Alan Adler by Kelly Kearse"},{"author":"angel","post":"jesterof, not fantasy, but reality.\nAs I mentioned, nitrites and nitrates are found in soil and contaminated drinking water, which was common in ancient Jerusalem.\nSoil Properties Affecting Formation of Nitric Oxide by Chemical Reactions of Nitrite\nA.

Initially CERN found neutrinos traveled faster than light’s speed, but at a later date, after having carefully measured their speed, concluded they did not travel faster than light.\nYet, have you ever wondered what lit the earth, prior to the formation of the sun and moon, enabling plant life to exist on the planet?\nWell it is my belief it was the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh), responsible for the light.\nThe first force was God the Father (Genesis 1:1 and 1:3) and the second force was the Holy Spirit, (light), Genesis 1:2.  \nAnd it may very well be the Holy Spirit traveled faster than the speed of light, since there was an expansion of the universe.  God did not create the sun, moon and stars until Genesis 1:14, yet abundant plant life carpeted the earth’s land mass. \nHugh will probably not agree. \nAlthough I have been called an heretic for this hypothesis,  I believe the following:\nThe Trinity ( 3 separate or interchangeable entities under on Godhead) is similar to Einstein’s theory, E = mc^2\nE = Energy (God the Father)\nm = mass (Jesus Christ, the Son)\nc =  speed of light ^2 (Holy Spirit, the Mother)  \nc in that formula is determined by the speed of the Holy Spirit (perhaps the speed of the Holy Spirit is equal to or faster than the speed of light, and is dependent on the circumstance. Expansion of the universe, as an example, would require the speed of the Holy Spirit to be faster than light’s speed.\nFather, Mother, and Son are a family unit.  God’s desire was for mankind to propagate the earth and to be representative of a family.\nAs well, God stated, Let US make man in OUR image, after OUR likeness in Genesis 1:26.\nThe reference is to God, the Father and the Holy Spirit, the Mother. This is the reason for the “us” and “our.”   And the dove is representative of the feminine, so it was the Holy Spirit (the Mother) who stated, as Jesus was being baptized by John, “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well-pleased.”  A mother can speak of her son, as well as a father.  And further, the Ruach HaKodesh is the femine gender in Hebrew, but was translated to “it” and “he” in the Latin and Greek.\nMy conclusion is the Holy Spirit is the Mother and the Holy Ghost is the resurrected Jesus.  I believe there was no way to distinguish between spirit (soul or breath) and ghost (apparition) in the Greek, so the words (spirit and ghost) were interchanged erroneously.\nReferencing the white powder referred to as monoatomic gold, I still believe there is no harm in testing Piero’s theory.   I wonder what the molecular structure and the chemical formula of this white powder might be or if a nuclear magnetic spectrum (NMR), or an Infrared spectrum (IR) is available.

Yet, the waistband of the gown was at sky level and I was standing on the ground.  And no matter how far up I looked, I was never able to see the face of the Holy Spirit, only the waistband of the gown, the black shoes (similar to a penny loafer, without the penny slots) and the beige cotton stockings that were slightly rolled at the ankles.  \nThe entire top half of the Holy Spirit was above sky level.  And she moved in a manner that was quite awkward, as if there were too much height or weight for her frame.  Scaliing down to the size of an average woman, I  would say her size was about a woman’s 14. The gown (skirt) was almost Victorian in style.\nAt this point, after having this dream, I researched to find the Holy Spirit was female gender, according to the Hebrew, Ruach Ha Kodesh.\nhttp://www.wattpad.com/1096411-who-what-is-the-ruach-hakodesh\nAnd then the dove (feminine representation) made sense, and the statement, “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased” represented the mother speaking of her son, and not the father.  I don’t know if this is antithetical to Catholic doctrine, but my dream was confirmed by finding “Ruach HaKodesh.”  This may be considered heretical, I’m not certain.\nI then started bleeding from a mole that suddenly manifested on my right side, ironically the same area where Jesus was pierced with the sword.   The bleeding wouldn’t stop, so I visited my physician.   My doctor sent me to a specialist and the dermatologist took a biopsy of the mole and told me to leave the band-aid on for 24 hours.  The next day, when I removed the band-aid the complete facial image of Jesus was detailed, including the “3” on the forehead.  The image was sharp and detailed; however, I waited a week and the blood had oxidized slightly.\nAt that time, I placed the band-aid in a cellophane bag and scanned it next to the Barrie Schwortz facial image.  The only difference is in my image the head is turned about 10 degrees to the left. \nAfter that the nail marks appeared on both my feet.  They were raised, red, and about a centimeter in diameter.  I took a picture of these as well.  \nAnd the last incident was another mole that started bleeding on the inner side of my left knee.  After the biopsy, the scar healed in the shape of a perfect cross.  I also took a picture of that.  The scar has almost healed at this point, but luckily I took a photo.\nI would like to post my blood Shroud image that is positioned next to Barrie’s shroud image (for comparison) on this thread.\nNext to the “3” on the forehead, on my image there is also a “6” and the Hebrew for “6” is vav, which means a connection, similar to our word “and” in English.  The explanation of vav is shown on the website below.\nhttp://webpages.charter.net/yarahministries/alphabet.html\nIf Dan would allow me to post the image, I will send it from my gmail account, since it allows the receiver to scan the image, thereby preventing viruses or malware attachments on photos.\nAs well, I was researching whether or not Jesus died in 33 AD or 36 AD.  Both had Friday passovers, but most scholars dictate 33 AD for His death, forgetting that 36 AD would also qualify.  If Jesus was born April 17th 6 BC and died in 36 AD his age would be 42.\nThis makes sense, since the Pharisee stated to Him, “You are not yet 50 years old, but you have seen Abraham.”\nIf Jesus was died in 33 AD His age would be 39, so the statement made by the Pharisee, would not make sense.  The Pharisee would have said, “You are not yet 40.”\n\n","date":"September 15, 2014 at 3:48 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/04/the-trimurti-of-the-italian-scientific-experimental-studies-on-the-shroud/","cat":"event","title":"The Trimurti of the Italian scientific-experimental studies on the Shroud"},{"author":"angel","post":"Hugh, I’m not certain if you saw my reply to you in a post above. \n I found the original patent by David Hudson on monoatomic gold, with the experimental procedure (extremely difficult).  \nThe IR spectra detailed two splits at approximately 1429 and 1490 cm^-1.  \nI doubt what is being sold on ebay is the same as that synthesized by Hudson.\nTake a look, if you have the time.

Therefore, the solution should still be acidic to some degree.  And Hudson increased the pH of this acidic solution to neutral pH with Sodium Hydroxide.  That is correct..\nAnd then Hudson states, “The NaAu hydrolyzes with the water and dissociates to form HAu.\nThis is also correct, since if NaAu was replaced with NaCl, after hydrolysis you woud isolate HCl and Hudson isolated HAu.  This step is correct.  And then he specifies getting a light grey precipitate of the gold that is hygroscopic (HAuXH2O).  He did not mention how many molecules of water were attached, meaning it varies.  \nThe last step  Hudson describes,”The monoatomic gold is placed in a porcelain ignition boat and annealed at 300C under an inert gas to remove hydrogen and to form a very chemically and thermally stable white gold monomer.”.\nI fail to see where you are getting a pile of dirt on page 21.  This is the purification procedure,  There is no dirt and there should be at least a gold atom, since Hudson started with gold.\nThere is no alchemy, since Hudson is not creating gold.  Hudson started with gold and ended with gold of some form or another (monoatomic gold).\nThe remaining pages in the experimental section are where Hudson performed the exact experiment with different metals, Palladium, Platinum, etc.\nYou are able to buy these compounds from chemical supply companies today, but they weren’t available during the time he began his research.\nUnless I’m missing something, the experimental procedure appears to be correct.  One would have to repeat the experiment to see if the final product is obtained.  \nBest,\n\n","date":"September 15, 2014 at 8:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/04/the-trimurti-of-the-italian-scientific-experimental-studies-on-the-shroud/","cat":"event","title":"The Trimurti of the Italian scientific-experimental studies on the Shroud"},{"author":"angel","post":"Hugh,  I see why you believe Hudson’s work to be alchemy.

Here is a pertinent quote from there by St. Modestus of Jerusalem (from a work of his: “On the Myrrhbearers”) and my translation:\n“Και στον άγιο Μόδεστο, Πατριάρχη Ιεροσολύμων (α’ ήμισυ ζ’ αιώνος) διαβάζομε: «Τον συμβολικό αριθμό επτά και όταν πρόκειται περί της αρετής και όταν πρόκειται περί της κακίας, βλέπομε να χρησιμοποιή η Αγία Γραφή. Ευλόγως, λοιπόν, διαλέγει ο Σωτήρας την Μαρία την Μαγδαληνή, από την οποία εξέβαλε επτά δαιμόνια, για να εκδίωξη μέσω αυτής, τον άρχοντα της κακίας (διάβολο) από την ανθρώπινη φύση. Διότι οι ιστορίες διδάσκουν την Μαγδαληνή αυτήν δια βίου παρθένον. Και αναφέρεται μαρτύριον της Μαρίας Μαγδαληνής, όπου γράφεται ότι για την άκραν παρθενίαν και καθαρότητά της, φαινόταν στους βασανιστές της, σαν καθαρό κρύσταλλο».”\n“And according to St. Modestus, Patriarch of Jerusalem (1st half of the 7th Century), we read: “The symbolic number seven we see used in the Holy Scriptures indicating virtue and indicating evil. Most likely [Ευλόγως], therefore, it is said that Mary Magdalene, from whom [Christ] cast out seven demons, that the Savior drove out from her the prince of evil (the devil) from the human nature. For the stories teach that this Magdalene was a virgin through her life. And it is mentioned that [at] the martyrdom of Mary Magdalene, as is written, that on account of her utter virginity and purity, she appeared to her torturers, as a pure crystal.” \nAnd Niko’s second comment on the subject\n“The same view is presented on the seven demons by Theophylactos of Bulgaria in his Ermenia on the Gospel according to St. Luke: “As there are seven spirits of virtue thus there are against them seven spirits of evil. As there is a Spirit of fear of God, thus there is against it a Spirit of a lack of fear of God. There is a Spirit understanding, there is against it a Spirit of a lack of understanding, and the same with the rest of them.

I guess that when we are investigating the closeness of our relationship to somebody else, only a single haplotype need be investigated, as long as it is present in both people. Maybe somebody who knows what he is talking about could clarify?\n***Angel says:  Hi, Hugh.\nThank you, but only one haplogroup is assigned to mtDNA (maternal line) and only one to YDNA (paternal line).\nI used my mtDNA K (Katrine clan) as an example.\nWhen you say we are closely related to other people, well that is true.\nIn my case, K (Katrine) haplogroup is the daughter of U (Ursula), as an example.  Therefore, my ancestors would go back beyond Katrine to Ursula’s line (U haplogroup) and Ursula’s line goes back to Africa (L haplogroup).  All separated by thousands of years.\nYet, these other groups, in my example Katrine, are pre-Katrine.  There is only one final haplogroup for the mother’s line and one for the father’s line.  In my case, the ancestors of K are U and the ancestors of U are L, but I am not assigned to all three (K, U and L) , but only K.\nI suspect, since the DNA of Jesus (Shroud) was fragmented, the genetic scientists were unable to definitely determine His final haplogroup (FTDNA), and if one of His markers indicated Ursula (U) then U was included as a haplogroup, and  if another of His markers indicated Africa, then L was included as a haplogroup and for this reason, there are both numerous haplogroups and subclades assigned to the TS mtDNA.  Garza-Valdez included mtDNA data only up to marker 263, where my refined mtDNA dat is in the multi-thousands.\nAs well, it matters not which genetic organization performs the DNA testing, all will give the same result for the final haplogroup and subclade.  \nThis link shows a photo of how everyone’s ancestors go back to Africa as well as the expansion times (years ago).\n http://www.worldfamilies.net/mtdnahaporigins\nThis is such an interesting field of study, but as a rule no one cares unless he/she has had his/her own personal DNA performed.  There are even DNA forums, where people from each of the various haplogroups and subclades discuss their common ancestry (Vikings, Kazars, etc.).  \nThe price has come down a lot and many times these genetic testing companies have sales on their services.  I paid separately for HVR1, HVR2 and finally FTDNA, but if anyone here chooses to have his or her DNA done, don’t pay separately for all three.  Just pay a little more, when there is a sale, for the refined test (FTDNA).   This test will include the other two.\nKelly Kearse may be able to clarify the results on the TS DNA.\nThanks again, Hugh.\nBest,\n\n","date":"May 1, 2015 at 4:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/26/might-tactile-chemography-prove-to-be-the-super-model/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Might tactile chemography prove to be the super-model?"},{"author":"angel","post":"Another scenario.\n“The atheistic scientist declares to God that he can make a man and allows God to go first in the demonstration. \nGod scoops up a handful of dirt and in a few minutes produces a perfect human being. \nThe scientist then scoops up a handful of dirt, but God interrupts him: “Get your own dirt.”\nhttp://www.partialobserver.com/article.cfm?id=2808\n\n","date":"August 17, 2014 at 5:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/08/17/scorched-by-god-a-hymn-for-this-sunday/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Scorched by God?

Lost to everybody, that is, except the Jews and others learned in the Torah, and in the Hebrew language of Scripture. \nThe Ruach is simply the femine manifestation of YHWH!\nLet’s begin by first stating that Hebrew, like many languages of the earth, contain both feminine and masculine tenses. The tense of the word determining the gender of the noun being described. For example, in Spanish “muchacho” means boy, and “muchacha” means girl. The “o” at the end of muchacho defining masculine tense, and the “a” at the end of muchacha defining feminine tense. \nIn Hebrew, the word “Ruach” is feminine tense, assigning to the Spirit a feminine nature, character, gender. But when a tense (male or female) is in reference to a life form, then the tense is in reference to the “gender” of the life form. \nSince we know the Ruach to be a conscious, living being, the manifested power of YHWH capable of leading us, guiding us, and of instructing and teaching us in the Way of all truth; Yochanan 14:26, Luka 12;12; we can determine from the tense of the Hebrew and Aramaic words that the Ruach HaKadosh is feminine tense, and therefore, “female in gender. \nThis point is entirely lost in the Greek which has no feminine tense for spirit, but only a neuter tense, which is why “Spirit” is always presented as a “He” in the Greek (neuter words are given male attributes in translation), which error has been erroneously transferred over into the English.  In the Aramaic the word for Spirit is Feminine as well with the word Ruacha axwr, confirming the Hebrew understanding of the word Ruaah or …”\n##  I tried to include the link, but this site is not working.

This means, in our opinion, that Hebrew is more precise and inspired than Greek. Moreover, we have good reason to believe that most, if not all, the New Testament was originally written in Hebrew and subsequently translated into Greek. Therefore in terms of defining the gender of the Holy Spirit, New Covenant Christians are more disposed to the Hebrew Old and New Testament witness of the Bible which overwhelmingly reveals the Holy Spirit to be feminine. \n English has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter (i.e. he, she and it). Hebrew and Aramaic have no neuter gender. In Hebrew and Aramaic everything is either a “he” or a “she” and nothing is an “it”. \nAlso gender plays a much more important role in Hebrew and in Aramaic than in English. In English gender is usually only an issue when dealing with pronouns. But in Hebrew and Aramaic nouns and verbs are also maculine or feminine. \nAnd while there are no true adjectives in Hebrew (nouns are also used as adjectives), noun modifiers must agree in gender with the noun. Now the Hebrew word RUACH (Aramaic RUCHA) is gramatically feminine as is the phrase Ruach haKodesh. This is matched by the rôle of the Ruach haKodesh as “comforter” (Jn.14-16) and the identifier of the “comforter” with YHWH acting as a “mother” (Is.66:13).\nit is very clear that the gender of the RUACH has been revised in many passages of the Aramaic to agree with the Hellenistic concept of the Holy Spirit as being either a he” or an “it”.  \nhttp://www.tektonics.org/qt/shespirit.html\nBest,\n\n","date":"May 19, 2013 at 2:45 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"angel","post":"jesterof,\nI believe you are missing the point of my statement.\nJust look at the two words spirit (soul) and ghost (apparition).\nDuring the transfiguration of Jesus, Simon thought he had seen a ghost (apparition).\nJesus stated something to the effect, the spirit (soul) resides in each of us.\nYet, the Greek uses both words, spirit and ghost, interchangeably.  These words are synonymous in the Greek.  There was no distinction between the two words in the Gospel.\nWith respect to my other statement, where I believe Jesus was 40, I am aligning this to the Moses law, so to speak.\nMoses spent 40 days and nights on Mt.

I had a vision of Genesis, where the Holy Spirit was walking through the trees in the Garden of Eden.  I saw a long grey, silky type skirt with an ivory/beige brocade detail around the waist band of the skirt, in the shape of a wide or elongated “V.”  I was standing on the ground and I could see the Holy Spirit’s shoes and ankles and the hem of the skirt.  I looked up so that I could see the face of the Holy Spirit, and no matter how far up I looked, I was never able to see the face.  The waistband of the skirt was at sky level and I was standing on the ground.  So, the upper part of the Holy Spirit was beyond the sky.\nTherefore, in my vision, the Holy Spirit was female.\nAfter this I made an attempt to find some scriptural verification of this fact.

Philip stated the following:\n“Those who believe Mary conceived by the Holy Spirit are in error.  When did a woman ever conceive of a woman?”\nTherefore, I believe Jesus helped me to see the light, in this case, and the vision settled the fact the Holy Spirit was female, at least, to my mind.\nI was watching the Sunday morning talk shows a few weeks ago and one of the panel referred to the Holy Spirit as a “He,” and Cokie Roberts quickly corrected him by stating “She.”  Therefore, word must be getting around in other circles, as well, the Holy Spirit is a “She.”\nYet, I can see your point in regard to your mother tongue and the various languages you speak.\nBest,\n\n","date":"May 21, 2013 at 5:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"angel","post":"Louis says:\n“The account in Genesis can not be taken literally, the Pentateuch is a composite document.”\n***Angel says:  Yes, I understand.

The Hebrew word for ‘image’ is masculine in gender, while the word for ‘likeness’ is feminine.\nWhen God formed man of the dust of the earth, he was made up of both male and female parts. This readily seen when God later separated these two parts. The Hebrew word TSELAH, translated rib’ in the KJV, actually means FLANK, SIDE, HALF.\nGod brought Adam’s other half to him and declared,t hey shall be one flesh (Gen.2:24). . . no longer duality\nTSELAH-flank has the same root meaning in Hebrew as does ‘image’. As God created male and female, He placed both soul and spirit in each human vessel. Thus we could put ‘image’ as the male — spirit and ‘likeness’ as the female — soul.\nGod called their name\nAdam (Gen. 5:1). Adam later declared that Eve\nwas bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. If she was just a ‘rib’, then he could only have said, Bone of my bone.”\nhttp://www.godfire.net/rayknight/70_Male_Female.pdf\nTherefore, when God created man in OUR image and OUR likeness He was referring to His male and female aspect, soul and spirit.  And Adam and Eve (male and female) were representative of the “flesh”  or body of mankind.\nAs a result, male and female were created with the purpose of being representative of both soul and spirit (God, the Father, Holy Spirit, the Mother) and the flesh, the mortal body (Adam and Eve).\nBest,\n\n","date":"May 24, 2013 at 2:33 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"angel","post":"Louis says:\n“There is absolutely no reason to interpret everything in the Bible as metaphor and the objection is against the fundamentalist approach, something like saying “Everything is true or nothing is true.” That is the biggest mistake and clashes with what we learn from science today, but not that science alone can determine what we can know about existence.”\n***Angel says: “Louis, the bible contains symbolism and metaphor, but a significant portion is literal.

Using historical data on the site I visited, the age of Jesus was calculated to be about 42 years. \nHere is an example, although this is not the site I saw originally.  Yet, the man on the TS surely looks to be in his 40s, not 30s.\nHistorical Data\n“The best way to date the death of Christ is to look for the key players in his death drama, about whom there is considerable information, and to establish the context surrounding Jesus’ death. We begin by acknowledging that Jesus’ death followed the death of John the Baptist, and occurred while Caiaphas*was High Priest and while Pilate*was Prefect. We*have reason to believe*that John the Baptist met his gruesome death in 35 A.D.*[1], Caiaphas was deposed by Lucius Vitellius, the legate of Syria, in 36 A.D. and Pilate was recalled to Rome at the end of 36 A.D [2]. Ipso facto, Jesus must have been crucified in the year 36 A.D. Having been born in 6 B.C. and having died in 36 A.D. means that Jesus was in his 40s when he died, probably 42 years old.\n*\nThe Gospel Record\n*\nFurther proof that Jesus was in his 40s when he died comes directly from the Gospel of John. Jesus is discussing the destruction of the temple and he says: ‘Destroy this temple, and in 3 days I will raise it up.’ The Jews then said, ‘This temple has been under construction for 46 years, and you will raise it up in 3 days?’ But he was speaking of the temple of his body (John 2:20-21).’ John points out that later, when he is crucified, Jesus’ disciples remembered his prophecy of the 3 days; however, no one seems to recall the 46 years. Taken at his word, Jesus is clearly saying that he is 46 years old, and that when he dies, he will resurrect in 3 days. If Jesus was 46 years old when he died in 36 A.D., it means he was born in 10 B.C., which is theoretically possible, although 6 B.C. is a more probable date.\n*\nWe find further proof that Jesus is in his 40s from the Gospel of John. Jesus is in a Temple, close to the Mount of Olives, talking to the Scribes*and Pharisees. The subject turns to Abraham, and the ‘Jews’ ask Jesus: ‘You are not yet 50 years old, and have you seen Abraham? (8:57).’Jesus answers: ‘…before Abraham was, I am’, but the important thing to observe here is that the questioners describe Jesus as not yet being 50. Were he in his 20s or 30s, they would have chosen a different year, but by saying that he is not yet 50, they clearly identify him as being in his forties.\n*\nOther Christian Sources\n*\nThe noted Christian Irenaeus*(130-202 A.D.) in Against Heresforc*\n�gainsins7�D.) ind have you inple of his bodeo old when he died.\n*\nAll this evidence shows a significant divergence from the commonly accepted idea that Jesus was in his 30s when he died. All three methods indicate Jesus died in his 40s, between 42 and 46. It also suggests that Jesus’ ministry was significantly longer than the 1 to 3 bodeo that are traditionally attributed to it, because if he began his ministry when he was about 30, and he died between 42 and 46, his ministry was 12 or more years, not 1 or 3.”\nhttpins//www.biblewheel.com/forum/showthread.phpinF1071-Date-of-Jesus-Crucifixion\nBest.\n\n","date":"May 10, 2013 at 7:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"},{"author":"angel","post":"Thank you, Luis.

In the end, the calculation was incorrect by a number of years due to missed historical facts. It is now known that Herod the Great died in the year 4 B.C. Since he was alive when Jesus was born, that already puts Christ’s birth earlier than the year 4 B.C. and not A.D. 1. Furthermore, we also know from Matthew two that Jesus was two years old at the time the wisemen and Herod met. If we put these things together, we can determine that Jesus was born between 7 and 6 B.C., which is why the Gregorian calendar is off by that many years.”\nhttp://www.ariel.org/qna/qjewcal.htm?iframe=true&\nRECOVERED CUNIFORM SCRIPT\n“This leads to consideration of a series of prior astrological events that occurred in 7 BCE. Four copies of an ancient Babylonian astronomical text, written in 8 BCE in cuneiform script on clay tablets, have been recovered. This text predicts a triple conjunction of the planets, Jupiter and Saturn, in the constellation, Pisces, on what are now known as May 27, October 6 and December 1, 7 BCE. “The . . . conjunction of 7 B.C.E. . . . was special in that the planets met three times in succession in the same constellation. . . .”\nhttp://www.worldviewpublications.org/outlook/archive/article.php?EDITION=078\nFurther, regardless of which of these scholars makes a claim as to any type of authenticity on an hypoethesis or theory, the proof or truth remain ONE archaeological dig away.  And unfortunately, without actual proof, nothing is set in stone.\nYet, even though gnostic text has been excluded from the Canon, if an archaeological dig unearthed an ancient gnostic text that detailed the Shroud of Turin as originating in 1BC, the fact it was gnostic scripture would be conveniently ignored and would be used as proof of the shroud’s authenticity.

I don’t hold a PhD and as a matter of fact, I only have 6 graduate credits toward my Master’s Degree.  I had to drop out of the graduate program when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, followed by my father’s liver cancer. \nYet, I’ve achieved quite a bit for someone who didn’t have a PhD, like Colin or you.  I was in line for another patent on a neuromuscular blocking drug, but our company was sold, prior to patent issue.  That really hurt, since I had worked on that particular compound for such a long period of time, in an effort to reduce the duration of the drug.\nAlthough Colin’s experiments may seem ridiculous to a person not familiar with scientific technique, all avenues leading to image formation on the Shroud must be explored and for this reason alone, I  give credit to and appreciate the effort Colin Berry has expended, referencing his research methodology.\nI may be incorrect, but I seem to recall either a documentary or a DVD on the “Event Horizon” that introduced Isabel Piczek as both an artist and a particle physicist.\nWhen I posted this information on an Amazon atheist site, in defence of the Shroud and Jesus, as God, all the scientists on that forum informed me Isabel Piczek was not a physicist, since they had thoroughly researched her background.  As well these scientists asked me to link them to Isabel’s university credentials.  I couldn’t find that specific information on the internet.\nThose scientists, who are atheists, can be extremely brutal at times and even today, they not only refer to the Shroud as the MIT (Magic Italian Tablecloth)  but they trumpeti the work of Garlaschelli.  And since they don’t believe Jesus existed at all (there’s no historical record) they have come to the conclusion the entire biblical story was merely fantasy.\nIt’s hurtful for a true believer to read such negative comments, concerning Jesus.  For this reason I am hoping scientists will either find some archaeological evidence for His existence or perform a novel type of scientific test on the Shroud that proves, without a doubt, the linen cloth dates to the first century.\nRegarding non-scientists, my belief is anyone is capable of presenting an hypothesis that eventually proves fruitful, in respect to the image on the Shroud.

Secondly, since Jews were traditionally interred with burial clothes, is he trying to convince us that Jesus was buried without any burial cloths in order that his interpretation carries weight?  Apparently so, which is just downright stupid.”\nAngel replied:  Pilate washed his hands, so the blood of Jesus would not fall upon him.  Pilate did not believe Jesus was worthy of death and ordered the sign “King of the Jews” be placed on the cross.  The Jews were adamently opposed to this sign, yet Pilate, in direct opposition to the Jews stated, “What I have written, I have written.”\nWith this in mind, Pilate released the body of Jesus to Joseph of Arimathea, the rich man, with knowledge that Jesus would have a proper burial.\nAs to the comments on the burial clothes of Jesus, I believe in the “Word of God,” but have found mistranslations, in a few New Testament scriptures that were translated from the original Hebrew, Greek and Latin into English.\nJust recently, I purchased a copy of “The Jewish New Testament” (Translation by David H. Stern), where the original Jewishness is clearly expressed within its pages.\nIn this New Testament Jewish translation, the versions of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, concerning the linen and how the body was wrapped are detailed.\nThe first two books, Matthew and Mark show the following:\nMatthew:  27: 57-59\n  “wrapped it in a clean linen sheet. \nMark: 15: 45-46   “he wrapped him in a linen sheet.  (referring to Joseph)\n***Yet, both versions, Matthew and Mark, fail to mention the “linen sheet” upon the disciples’ entrance into the tomb after the resurrection.\nLuke and John read as follows:\nLuke: 23:53   “wrapped it in a linen sheet. (referring to Joseph)\nJohn: 19:40  “wrapped it up in linen sheets.”  (referring to Joseph and Nicodemus)\nAfter the resurrection, on entering the tomb,\nLuke: 24:12   Stooping down, he saw only the burial clothes. (referring to Peter)\nJohn: 20:5  The other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.\nStooping down, he saw the linen burial-sheets lying there, but did not go in. \nIn conclusion, Luke’s version started with a linen sheet (singular) and ended with burial clothes (plural).\nAnd John’s version started with wrapped in linen sheets and ended with linen burial-sheets.\nYet three books, Matthew, Mark and Luke clearly indicate Jesus was initially wrapped in a single linen sheet (sindone).  And the burial clothes (plural) in Luke, after the resurrection, may refer to the single linen sheet and head napkin.  This would account for the plural (burial clothes) outlined in Luke.\nObviously, according to the Hebrew translation, Jesus was given a traditional burial.\n\n","date":"September 23, 2012 at 3:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/23/downright-stupid-analysis-in-the-empty-tomb-jesus-beyond-the-grave/","cat":"books","title":"Downright Stupid Analysis  in The Empty Tomb: Jesus Beyond the Grave"},{"author":"angel","post":"There’s no edit button, but it shoud read “On” and not “One.”\n\n","date":"October 1, 2012 at 12:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/23/downright-stupid-analysis-in-the-empty-tomb-jesus-beyond-the-grave/","cat":"books","title":"Downright Stupid Analysis  in The Empty Tomb: Jesus Beyond the Grave"},{"author":"angel","post":"Louis, I agree with you.\nAn excerpt from your referenced article follows:\n“King’s announcement about the fragment, which she called the Gospel of Jesus’s Wife, came after the school released details in advance to The New York Times and The Boston Globe, which gave the story prominent play.
