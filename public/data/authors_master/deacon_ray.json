He taught Biblical criticism, NT and church history for 25 years at the largest Catholic univeristy in America. His many books can be found in the bookstores of every Catholic college.It all comes down to how much the Christ of Faith is the Jesus of History for you. Crossan is probably about 25%, I’m 75% which is about right for most Catholics.Jones is probably about 95%, thinks he is 100%. I like Crossan without agreeing with him. Crossan makes me think. I like Jones, too, in the same way.\n\n","date":"June 18, 2013 at 7:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/16/which-came-first-the-gospels-or-the-shroud/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Which Came First, the Gospels or the Shroud?"}]}
