It’s from that Joe Jackson paper Stephen Jones put online: “There are, in addition, other aspects of the Shroud which indicate that the cloth enveloped a real body. This is demonstrated by the numerous bloodstains, labeled B F in Figure la, which correspond to distinctly [328] different flow directions, consistent with a vertical crucifixion first, followed by a horizontal burial of a real corpse. Several examples that illustrate flows in the vertical position are the wound in the side (Feature B), trickles along the forearms (Feature D), puncture wounds on the head (Feature E) and the wrist wound (Feature C). Conversely, the bloodstain across the small of the back (Feature F) and the trickle at the dorsal foot (Feature G 1) correspond to a body oriented in the horizontal position. The latter set of bloodstains depict liquid and, therefore, presumably late time post mortem flows. In contrast, the vertical bloodstain set corresponds to clot transfers and, hence, earlier flows that had dried to some extent. Thus, the bloodstains are consistent with crucifixion followed by burial.”.","date":"2012-02-17","mins":"2:55 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly"},{"id":"comment-8481","author":"the_deuce","post":"Here’s another interesting paper that summarizes a lot of the interesting features of the Shroud as of 2000, including the blood and why we know it’s blood: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ford1.pdf In particular, from page 7: “Adler and others answer Vignon’s question and Mc Crone’s objection in the following manner. For one thing, not all the ‘blood’ material is red, for its color ranges from yellow to orange to red to brown. Also, the ‘blood’ is not whole blood, but exudate from a blood clot (when a blood clot dries, it contracts, exuding liquid blood material). The ‘blood’ moreover is blood clot exudate from a beaten, traumatized individual.A traumatic beating would destroy red blood cells, and the red cell debris would go to the liver, which in turn would take the debris’s hemoglobin and convert it to the bile pigment bilirubin. Bilirubin levels in the blood would rapidly rise, meaning that should a cut form, the resulting blood clot’s exudate will contain serum albumin (a protein found in blood serum), and that albumin will bring with it bilirubin. The clot exudate’s hemoglobin oxidizes to become “methemoglobin,” which is reddish brown/ brown; this reddish brown/ brown + the yellow orange bilirubin = red.” In other words, many of the various puzzles regarding the blood are actually further evidence of authenticity. In this case, we have evidence that it’s not just any human blood, but blood from a heavily traumatized individual, and furthermore that it’s partial blood exuded from already drying blood clots, rather than whole liquid blood painted on..","date":"2012-02-19","mins":"5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/02/16/must-read-all-old-blood-types-as-ab-not-exactly/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"MUST READ: A lot of old blood types as AB: Not Exactly"}],"forensic":[{"author":"the_deuce","post":"I don't get Porter's point. *Obviously* the square isn't strong evidence for the Shroud's authenticity all by itself, and could be discounted as a strange but not too extraordinary coincidence in isolation, but nobody has ever suggested taking it in isolation in the first place.

If the only thing we had to go on was the legend about St. Jude bringing a cloth that Jesus wiped his sweat on to Edessa, then yes, that would be extremely weak, even contradictory. But there are other stories and descriptions that mention there being blood on it for certain, including blood from the spear wound on his side specifically, and that seem to indicate that it was a full length image. There are other descriptions that describe it as a very faint, ghostlike image, and which indicate that the Edessa cloth was stored in a way that it wasn’t totally visible. And there appears to be internal evidence from the Shroud itself that it was kept folded in a way that may have only made the face and upper chest visible. I think you can conclude from the Edessa stories themselves that there was confusion caused by people’ limited knowledge of the image. For instance, the image almost certainly had blood on it, but the story of Jesus merely wiping his face on it was developed by someone who didn’t know that. The story that attributed it to him wiping his face at Gethsemane was developed by someone who was aware of the facial blood and tried to account for it, but wasn’t aware of the blood elsewhere on the Shroud, later attributed to his side wound. Legends that involved Jesus imprinting his whole body by wiping his face were developed by people who realized there was more than just a face there and wanted to explain it, etc. That’s all to say that there are some descriptions of the Edessa cloth that seem to fit an identification with various aspects the Shroud and some that don’t, but also internal evidence from just the descriptions themselves that some of those stories were developed by people who weren’t aware of many of the Edessa cloth’s properties, likely because of the way the cloth was stored and displayed (much as how we didn’t learn about the reverse side image on the Shroud until just a couple years ago!)

Showing us examples of how photos and paintings produce garbage results merely illustrates our point for us that the Shroud is not a painting or a photo, but an elevation map..","date":"2012-01-31","mins":"8:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/31/badder-still-bad-archaeology-at-bad-archaeology/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Badder Still: Bad Archaeology at Bad Archaeology"},{"id":"comment-7820","author":"the_deuce","post":"And your willful, obstinate, invincible ignorance of the most basic data disqualifies you from courtesy..","date":"2012-02-01","mins":"1:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/31/badder-still-bad-archaeology-at-bad-archaeology/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Badder Still: Bad Archaeology at Bad Archaeology"}],"researchers":[{"author":"the_deuce","post":"Hi Steve,This is pretty interesting. In addition to reading your blog, I've also been poking around Dan Porter's blog, where you posted on this hypothesis here, as well as the finding that the Shroud actually does have a faint image on the back side of the front image, as predicted by Jackson.I think it's increasingly obvious that, at the bare minimum, the Shroud image *must* have been caused by a real human body, and that skeptical arguments, if they are to have any merit at all, must start with that premise. We already went into the sheer absurdity that results when you try to imagine what it would require for some medieval artist to forge such an image.With that said, what do you make of Ray Rogers' hypothesis of some kind of \"naturalistic\" image formation caused by some sort of chemical reaction of the Shroud to the corpse of the man on it? Personally, I find several things wrong with it. First, if the image was created by the Shroud folding into the crevices of the dead man's body and undergoing some sort of chemical reaction as it made contact with his skin, it seems to me that you would expect the image to come out distorted when the cloth was removed made flat again.Second, it strikes me as wildly implausible that such a \"naturalistic\" process would just happen to occur on the body of Jesus, and nobody else in history that we're aware of. Alternatively, if we wish to propose that it's not really Jesus' body, but some other body, we must suppose that some forger knew about this mysterious \"naturalistic\" process that still eludes us, found some guy who looked like Jesus in the artwork, then whipped him, crucified him, stuck a crown of thorns on his head, and speared him in the side to make his injuries look like Jesus', then put what would become the Sudarium of Oviedo on his face, then removed the Sudarium and put the Shroud over him, and performed whatever type of chemical wizardry was necessary to make the man's image transfer to the Shroud (but unknown to everyone else of his day and still unknown to us), then somehow passed the Shroud and Sudarium off as legitimate.Still, from reading Dan Porter's blog, there seems to be some disagreement between Ray Rogers' description of the image and the ENEA's, with Ray Rogers claiming that the image only exists in some sort of film of impurities on the surface of the Shroud, without perturbing the actual linen fibers at all, and the ENEA team postulating that the image is burned into the primary cell walls of the linen fibers. Do you have any insight into this?.","date":"2012-01-24","mins":"5:32 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html","title":"\nJohn P.

Hamon attributes it to \"more pressure\" on the cloth by the hands and face. Personally, I find Hamon's idea problematic because if the reverse side image were the result of more pressure, then there should have been a *much stronger* image of Jesus' back on the reverse side of the back image than there is of his face and hands on the reverse of the front side. After all, the back is the side of the Shroud he was laying on, with the full pressure of his body weight! And, finally, why do we see Jesus' hair so clearly on the Shroud, which shouldn't have exerted any significant pressure at all (actually, it occurs to me that the hair is just as serious and maybe fatal a problem for Ray Rogers and any other possible \"naturalistic\" explanation involving chemical reaction with a dead body as well)? In any event, the idea that the reverse image was caused by pressure presupposes that this is a real body we're talking about. In fact, the existence of the reverse side image puts further paid to the notion that this was some sort of paint job.Btw, I got a bit of a chuckle out of sciencebod's objection that started the thread at Dan Porter's blog that I linked to. He tries to argue that the image isn't really 3 D because the burn holes create a 3 D appearance under topological analysis as well, and he seems to think that this is some sort of major revelation. Um, duh. Isn't it obvious that the 3 D image arises from differences in hue caused by the different intensities of \"burn in\" on the image, so that anything else that causes a gradation of hue (such as a burn mark) will produce a \"3 D effect\" in an analysis that estimates depth based on hue? What was sciencebod expecting? An actual hologram on a linen cloth?! Anyhow, by making the argument that the 3 D image is fake, and that it's actually some sort of 2 D image masterfully made to look 3 D, he's implicitly committed himself to precisely those absurdities that we covered earlier. In fact, he seems to compound the insanity by insisting that the image was made with \"a converging lens, concave mirror, or even pinhole camera\" (just try to imagine a medieval forger performing such a feat)!.","date":"2012-01-24","mins":"5:33 AM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2012/01/john-p-jackson-unconventional.html","title":"\nJohn P.

With this, the single solitary piece of evidence against the Shroud's authenticity, the one thing the skeptics had to cling to, has been shattered. And just in time for Easter!I doubt many skeptics will be persuaded by this, or any possible evidence no matter how strong. If they won't believe Moses and the Prophets, after all, they will not believe even if one is raised from the dead.However, I expect we're going to see a lot of even loopier theories about the Shroud from them, as these findings paint them into an even smaller and more untenable corner than they were already in. In particular, I think we're going to see a lot more Wesselow style \"real but fake\" nonsense, where the skeptic admits the Shroud was the real burial cloth of Jesus, but tries to explain away the image as somehow an accident rather than a miracle..","date":"2013-04-01","mins":"11:06 PM","url":"http://theshroudofturin.blogspot.com/2013/03/new-experiments-on-shroud-show-its-not.html","title":"\nNew experiments on Shroud show it's not medieval\n"}],"resources":[{"id":"comment-30047","author":"the_deuce","post":"On a more general point of view, Fanti’s own credibility as an unbiased scientist free of any preconceived notions regarding Shroud research That’s an absurd standard.
