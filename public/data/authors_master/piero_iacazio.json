The work by Lucotte seemed interesting because he has found the talc powder sticked together the blood particles. Then we have to explain this fact. The possible reasons for that particular fact are the following : 1) contamination. Included the process similar the inclusion of the Hg S particles in the linen cloth that Mc Crone has found. Then the explanation can be the same. During the copy (contact) the transfer of the particles happened and then the talc powder was sticked with bloodstains (this phenomenon requires a certain pressure). 2) treatment of the corpse : this happened during the phase of the Deposition. After the use of the Oviedo’s cloth (Sudarium of Oviedo) the disciples used the talc powder (perhaps before to cover the corpse, into the tomb. This fact can also be considered as a proof for the preparation of the corpse (also in order to stolen the body !?!). But we have no proof about this particular idea. The work by Lucotte cannot be used for that purpose. It is too rough (from the point of view of the SPM controls). The level of the analyses for the talc powder sticked with blood particles is not useful because it is too rough. He has not used the SP Ms analyses and then, reading that work, we have no exact idea. What is the reason for the blood particles sticked with blood particles ? We can only speak about the vague hypotheses. 3) the entire linen was covered with talc powder (this seems to be a very strange idea). See the previous scenario. We have no useful proof to speak in one manner or another. — — — In conclusion : we have to see what will be the verdict obtained from the use of the Scanning Probe Microscopies (= SP Ms).

This seems to be very difficult, but I believe that using the SP Ms techniques we can discover the situation (but, after the centuries, the material can be brittle). The evaluation for the adhesion of the blood on linen is another interesting point to investigate. Unfortunately (if I am right) there is no adequate study (for an ancient archaeological linen) on that forensic argument. So, we have to work for the right research about the Shroud.

Areas of study were selected on the basis of pigment density or other specific features of interest. — — — The use of Raman microprobe spectrometry has conclusively identified the materials used in the construction of two significant historical documents, the Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation. Although the inks used for the Tartar Relation are entirely appropriate for the period of its construction, one of those used to draw the Vinland Map is not.

Why ? We can start from the fact that the Resurrection is a Mystery of Faith and not a simple scientific fact to show ! Are you able to reproduce a Resurrection in the Lab ? In any case the claims by de Wesselow about the Origin of the Christian Faith are not completely original. I refer (for example) to the booklet : “The Shroud Was the Resurrection: The Body Theft, the Shroud in the Tomb, and the Image that Inspired a Myth” by John Loken (Paperback – April 16, 2006) I have read that strange book some year ago … Am I wrong ? How is possible to forget all the past (and present) History (and also the particular image of the Veil of Manoppello)? — — The only interesting and reasonable thing that we can underline is the possibility for new dating attempts, with the advanced systems. In this manner we have the solution for the true epoch of that ancient linen and this is an important step. How is possible to reach that solution ? I know that there are the new 14 C tests (see the work of two Italian teams from National Institute of Optics and from European Laboratory of non linear spectroscopy, Florence. They published a very interesting paper on the high impact factor journal “Physical Review Letters” entitled Molecular Gas Sensing Below Parts Per Trillion: Radiocarbon Dioxide Optical Detection. = They were able to measure 14 C concentrations at a 43 parts per quadrillion level. Wow !!!) but I don’t believe in the (useless) destructions. — — Here I cannot write a too long message, so I want to suggest two ways : 1) the use of the SP Ms (= the new advanced microscopies = AFM, CFM, SNOM, used in order to discover the cellulosic Dp value and then the probable epoch) 2) the use of the new system by Miao and others. There is an article under the address : http://www1.cnsi.ucla.edu/news/item?item id=2045547 “New technique lets scientists peer within nanoparticles, see atomic structure in 3 D”. And this is the inherent text : >March 21, 2012 – UCLA researchers are now able to peer deep within the world’s tiniest structures to create three dimensional images of individual atoms and their positions. Their research, published March 22 in the journal Nature, presents a new method for directly measuring the atomic structure of nanomaterials. >”This is the first experiment where we can directly see local structures in three dimensions at atomic scale resolution — that’s never been done before,” said Miao. — — What is your opinion ? Is the problem about the cellulosic Dp measurement a sort of enquiring work too difficult to perform ? Is it impossible to work (on ancient linen fibrils) without the destructions ? So the question is the following : What is the level of destruction that we can accept for the Holy Shroud or for the Sudarium of Oviedo (or for both the cellulosic reperts) ? — — In any case the 14 C tests are more destructive … So, I want to know what are your perspectives. — — Regards, Piero Iacazio.","date":"2012-03-29","mins":"10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/28/quote-for-today-stephen-e-jones-on-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","title":"Quote for Today: Stephen E.
