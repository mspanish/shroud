Included the process similar the inclusion of the HgS particles in the linen cloth that McCrone has found. Then the explanation can be the same. During the copy (contact) the transfer of the particles happened and then the talc powder was sticked with bloodstains (this phenomenon requires a certain pressure).2) treatment of the corpse : this happened during the phase of the Deposition. After the use of the Oviedo’s cloth (Sudarium of Oviedo) the disciples used the talc powder (perhaps before to cover the corpse, into the tomb. This fact can also be considered as a proof for the preparation of the corpse (also in order to stolen the body !?!). But we have no proof about this particular idea. The work by Lucotte cannot be used for that purpose. It is too rough (from the point of view of the SPM controls). The level of the analyses for the talc powder sticked with blood particles is not useful because it is too rough. He has not used the SPMs analyses and then, reading that work, we have no exact idea.

How is possible to forget all the past (and present) History (and also the particular image of the Veil of Manoppello)?— —The only interesting and reasonable thing that we can underline is the possibility for new dating attempts, with the advanced systems.In this manner we have the solution for the true epoch of that ancient linen and this is an important step.How is possible to reach that solution ?I know that there are the new 14C tests (see the work of two Italian teams from National Institute of Optics and from European Laboratory of non linear spectroscopy, Florence. They published a very interesting paper on the high-impact-factor journal “Physical Review Letters” entitled Molecular Gas Sensing Below Parts Per Trillion: Radiocarbon-Dioxide Optical Detection. = They were able to measure 14C concentrations at a 43 parts-per-quadrillion level. Wow !!!) but I don’t believe in the (useless) destructions.— —Here I cannot write a too long message, so I want to suggest two ways :1) the use of the SPMs (= the new advanced microscopies = AFM, CFM, SNOM, used in order to discover the cellulosic Dp value and then the probable epoch)2) the use of the new system by Miao and others. There is an article under the address :http://www1.cnsi.ucla.edu/news/item?item_id=2045547“New technique lets scientists peer within nanoparticles, see atomic structure in 3-D”.andthis is the inherent text :>March 21, 2012 – UCLA researchers are now able to peer deep within the world’s tiniest structures to create three-dimensional images of individual atoms and their positions. Their research, published March 22 in the journal Nature, presents a new method for directly measuring the atomic structure of nanomaterials.>”This is the first experiment where we can directly see local structures in three dimensions at atomic-scale resolution — that’s never been done before,” said Miao.— —What is your opinion ?Is the problem about the cellulosic Dp measurement a sort of enquiring work too difficult to perform ?Is it impossible to work (on ancient linen fibrils) without the destructions ?So the question is the following :What is the level of destruction that we can accept for the Holy Shroud or for the Sudarium of Oviedo (or for both the cellulosic reperts) ?— —In any case the 14C tests are more destructive … So, I want to know what are your perspectives.— —Regards,Piero Iacazio","date":"March 29, 2012 at 10:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/28/quote-for-today-stephen-e-jones-on-thomas-de-wesselow/","cat":"books","title":"Quote for Today: Stephen E.
