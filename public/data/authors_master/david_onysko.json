Laboratories such as: NASA, Los Alamos, Jet Propulsion (Pasadena, CA), Air Force Weapons (Colorado), Brooks Institute, etc…have brought their equipment and academic expertise to examine it. To say “One good reason why we cannot explain the image is…..because there really has not been sufficient research carried out on this particular phenomenon” is such an incredulous comment, it either reflects someone who is surprisingly uninformed as it relates to the STURP testing of 1978 (as well as all of the subsequent research done in the years since), or it reflects someone who may harbor an opinion not supported by the facts. True, the object is rare and carefully guarded. However, STURP scientists were given access to it for 120 consecutive hours of non destructive testing. I hope any future comments you may have will reflect what has long been established in Sindology..","date":"2014-03-21","mins":"12:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/20/comment-promoted-another-hypothesis-about-the-image-formation/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Comment Promoted:  Another hypothesis about the image formation"}],"misc":[{"id":"comment-217128","author":"david_onysko","post":"Dan…….I just wanted to express my appreciation for the enormous contribution your Shroud blog has become for Shroud scholarship. Certainly, those in sindonology will long remember…..(and use)…..the myriad topics and forums your efforts brought to the table for us to react to…..or not react to!
