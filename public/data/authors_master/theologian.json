The field is multidisciplinary. There are archaeologists and historians and plenty of people who have studied ancient textiles. Nobody but Lupia thinks it is a tallit. This is simply nutty. The guy who claimed that the shroud could not be real because he found a fragment of a shroud was also an archaeologist. Should we believe him because he is an archaeologist who has also studied ancient textiles. As for the claim the the other translations are inept is arrogant in the extreme. That one statement alone makes me wonder if Lupia has any comprehension about the scope of modern biblical scholarship. I think I’ll wait on the reviews before I spend this kind of money..","date":"2010-03-04","mins":"3:54 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/03/02/new-shroud-of-turin-book-by-john-n-lupia/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"New Shroud of Turin book by John N. Lupia"}]}
