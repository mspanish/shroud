He was in a coma for nine weeks and doctors told my grandmother je would never live. About six weeks I to the coma my grandmother was at his side and he was mumbling about swimming with Jesus in a waterfall. And that his cousin Jimmy was there with him. He came out if the coma several weeks later.  His cousin Jimmy who was an infant at the time died of SIDS… Sudden infant death sydrome weeks later. My grandmother had told her sister about my dads dream and his mumbling and that her son was with him. My grandma said her sister wouldn’t talk to her for a year because she said Giod took her son and have hers back. Heaven is real… Jesus is real… And God is real… And I feel so sorry for those that don’t believe.","date":"May 30, 2012 at 6:30 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
