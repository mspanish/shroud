{"image":[{"author":"nova_scotia","post":"You might want to caution your readers.\nThere is something troubling about the 3D imagery generated by Petrus Soons. Look at the blood stains on the forehead and in the hair. They are close to full white ranging mostly from 211 to 240 on a 255 grayscale. Yet it is in the extreme that the stains are seemingly on the same elevation as surrounding 88 gray. I think impossible! How was this accomplished? \nDid Soons find some brilliantly intelligent software that imitates non-algorithmic human swizzling? There are other instances where the plotted terrain cliffs or flies dramatically up or down because it seems human judgment says it should in places where ordinary algorithms would certainly fail to accomplish this. This is particularly so where Soons applies the Barrie Schwortz adjustment on the left cheek but not the right cheek, yet the hill and valley pattern is the same. Check it out with the stereoscopic images and densitometer in Photoshop. How is this so?\nI can find nowhere on his cite where Soons explains his methods or what computer programs he used except for the prepping of anaglyphs, lenticulars and stereos. What did he use?\nThe VP8 work was honest and true. It may have been primitive but it worked. Let’s just say I have a hard time understanding how the Soons images are algorithmically done. Reproduce this work in the public eye, I say. Explain how software does such magical things. Provide some large hidef images for examination. \nAl\n\n","date":"September 30, 2010 at 5:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/28/americans-deeply-ignorant-about-religion-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Really, Really New Big Deal Shroud of Turin Website"}]}
