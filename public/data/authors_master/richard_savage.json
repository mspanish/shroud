Perhaps he was wrong in his conclusions, but we have no significant reason to doubt his honesty regarding them. It’s clearly possible that he was being dishonest, but the available evidence supports his honesty much more than it undermines his honesty.2. The scientific processes surrounding the carbon dating were not especially rigorous.3. Rogers found 3 major differences between the carbon dating (and Raes) samples and the rest of the cloth.4. In 2005, John L. Brown of the Georgia Institute of Technology confirmed Rogers’ findings.5. In 2008, a group from the Los Alamos National Naboratories also confirmed Rogers’ findings.6. Other scientific evidence supports a much earlier date than that concluded by the carbon dating.7. Historical evidence does also.8.

The Randi forum seems to be an extremely popular and respected (by skeptics) advocate for skepticism in general.2. The aim of my method for debate is not to enlighten my opponents.  My aim is to attract a large audience, and enlighten THEM.3. I think that if we can develop just a SLIGHTLY effective debate between us and those on the Randi forum, we have the beginnings of something important.  That is,3.1. I can’t fully impose my method on their current forum – so, even if I’m right about the overall method, I can’t expect to directly accomplish a whole lot over there, as things stand.3.2. But then, if I can show just a little bit of “progress” (defined below) over there, and keep working on it, I might eventually be able to convince the administrators over there to allow for an experimental thread using my suggested method.3.3. Maybe, I could convince Dan, or another one of our leaders to “sponsor” such a debate in front of a large audience on whatever website.3.4. Whatever, I sure think that someone with some influence needs to be researching the possibility of actually effective debate.(“Progress” being the explicit isolation of BASIC disagreements — where the two sides don’t have anything further to add re the particular, specific, disagreement, and can thereby agree to disagree for now re that particular disagreement – thereby, allowing the audience to best judge that particular disagreement for themselves.

I plan to present this list to the Randi forum.  Please let me know how you think I should revise, delete or add to my list.– I say “first level” because each claim below is supported by other claims — which, in turn, will be supported by more claims, etc.  For instance, the Pray Codex would be introduced and discussed under claim # 10 – and, would therefore, need not be added to THIS list.  Hopefully, at some point, I’ll get around to focusing on #10, and then, the Pray Codex…– I will present this to the Randi forum as a lead-in to beefing up my current focus on #11 – the reliability and validity of the carbon dating.  I present this list because my attempt at actually effective debate requires a kind of “murder board” (like they show on detective TV shows) with a diagram giving structure to the overall argument.  I hope that translates.1.The shroud is one of the most studied artifacts in human history.  Also, it is at least 700 years old.  Even so, no modern artist or scientist has ever been able to fully reproduce or explain it.2.No similar ancient artifact has ever been found.  (If this was a forgery, the genius who forged it, didn’t leave any other (what would have been extremely valuable) examples, or attempts, behind.)3.Though, in 1981 a mattress cover did develop a similar image when it was left on a man who had just died…  (Is this some kind of rare, but totally NATURAL, phenomenon?)4.Science has essentially proven that the shroud4.1.Is not a painting.4.2.Is not a photograph.4.3.Is 3D.4.4.Is holographic.5.The image on the shroud almost has to be some sort of imprint of someone who was recently tortured and crucified.6.The figure on the shroud is extremely detailed and in total agreement with the Biblical account of the crucifixion.7.Some of the correct detail of a victim of crucifixion could not have been known by, seen by, painted by or desired to be painted by any forger 700 years ago.8.The historical evidence for its early existence is actually substantial and growing.9.There is plenty of reasonable doubt re the validity of the 1988 carbon dating.10.Other than the carbon dating, the evidence against the shroud’s authenticity is really quite unimpressive.11.Other than the scientists involved in the carbon dating, only one involved scientist has argued that the Shroud is not authentic (Walter McCrone) – whereas, there have been numerous involved scientists that have argued the opposite.  The other notable skeptics are only in the “audience.”12.There is real blood on the shroud (involving some of the details noted in #7, above), and in the right places.13.The one involved scientist (from #11) claimed that there was no blood on the shroud.14.There is a barely visible second image of the face on the back of the shroud – with no discoloration between the two layers.  How would an artist do that? 15.In effect, the shroud is a negative.  How would a forger know how to do that, be able to do that and why WOULD he do that — hundreds of years before photography was invented?16.One very unusual aspect of the stitching on the shroud (the side strip) has also been found on a shroud in the ruins of Masada (an ancient Israeli fortress).  Masada was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans.17.Evidence of pollen and flowers — specific to Palestine in the first century — has been found on the shroud.  Other pollen evidence on the shroud fits with the shrouds traditional itinerary.18.Evidence of appropriate Roman coins is found on the closed eyelids of the victim.19.If the shroud is not the burial cloth of Jesus, its most likely explanation is that of a forgery perpetrated by space aliens.— Rich","date":"October 24, 2012 at 9:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/21/an-open-thread-for-rich-savage-questions/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"An Open Thread for Rich Savage Questions"},{"author":"richard_savage","post":"Anoxie,– Thanks again.– I think that the following is a good article on the hologram theory.  http://shroud3d.com/home-page/introduction-holographic-observations-in-the-shroud-image-holographic-theory.

I claimed that the scientists didn’t choose the sample — the church did, and the scientists were just forced to go along with the Church’s choice.  Here’s the argument that I eventually came up with.  I’ve probably mistated here and there, so any additions, deletions or corrections otherwise would be greatly appreciated.1.On 26 Aug 1974, on the urging of Ian Wilson, Walter McCrone sent a letter to Father Peter Rinaldi, S.D.B., in Turin.  In that letter, McCrone submitted a proposal to carbon date the shroud.2.In his book, McCrone notes that his proposal changed over the next three years, so he didn’t include the original in his book … but by 1977 at least, as you will see below, he was advocating one of the Raes samples.3.Harry Gove first learned of the Shroud in a letter dated 8 Jun 1977, from Reverend David Sox – the Secretary General of the British Society for the Turin Shroud (BSTS) — asking if Gove’s new carbon dating method could be applied to the Shroud.4.In his letter, Sox included the 1977 version of McCrone’s proposal that suggested using one of the Raes samples for dating.5.In July of 77, Gove responded that his new carbon dating method could be used, but that the method would require more work before it should be applied to something so “renowned” as the shroud (even though Gove hadn’t known about the shroud himself, he apparently realized that a lot of people had)…6.On  16 Feb 1979, Gove sent a letter to the Archbishop of Turin, Cardinal Ballestrero by way of Don Piero Coero-Borga (whoever the latter was, for whatever the reason) proposing carbon dating of the Shroud using one of the Raes samples.7.I can’t get the timing quite straight, or who got the idea from whom, but by 1979 Luigi Gonella, science advisor to the archbishop of Turin, was also advocating one of the Raes samples for the carbon dating.8.Though, Gonella may have just been following instructions from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences…9.At that time, STURP also accepted the suggestion.10.Gove’s letter (#5 above) didn’t make it to Ballestrero until years later (1984?).11.Somewhere in that time, Gonella changed his mind, claiming that the Raes samples had not been properly cared for and were probably too contaminated to use for the carbon dating.12.Gove agreed – accepting something else (what, I don’t know) instead.13.In 84, STURP submitted a protocol, of its own, requiring samples to be taken from 3 different areas on the Shroud.14.In June of 85, a summary (by David Sox) of the Trondheim protocol just indicated samples (plural).15.So far, I can’t find a copy of that protocol, but supposedly it specified taking samples from 3 different areas.16.In the fall of 86, several interested scientific groups sent representatives to Turin, and turned out the Turin Protocol, which called for 7 different tiny samples – but apparently, all adjacent to each other.17.This conference was organized by Harry Gove, and most of those attending the conference were associated with carbon dating labs.18.Together, they decided to exclude STURP and STURP’s multi-disciplinary approach.19.The Turin Protocol did require that the samples taken not be near any patched or charred areas.20.In the end (21 April 1988), Giovanni Riggi, foremost Scientific Advisor to Cardinal Ballestrero, Luigi Gonella and two linen experts, after an hour or two of debate selected one small area adjacent to the Raes sample.21.They made this selection even though the Raes area had appeared to involve patching, was a few inches away from an area charred by the fire of 1532, was contaminated by the water used to put out the fire, and being one of the two corners held by “volunteers” when displayed hundreds of times over the centuries had to be somewhat contaminated and not chemically representative of the greater shroud…22.So far, I haven’t been able to find out the limitation of their choices, nor who determined the limitations.  (I may have known at one point, but if I did, I can’t remember them now…)23.From William Meacham at http://shroud.wikispaces.com/CARBON.14.DATING… It is frequently reported that the original C-14 protocol drawn up at the Turin conference of 1986, jointly sponsored by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Turin Archdiocese, was to have seven samples from seven different sites on the Shroud. This is incorrect. At that conference a rough compromise emerged with the protocol calling for seven samples to be taken but from only ONE sampling site. The lab directors rejected the strong resistance on the latter point from a few individuals at the conference, because in the directors’ view having two or more sampling sites increased the possibility of an outlier. They sought at all costs to have a result supported by the largest possible number of labs, primarily for public consumption.24.So, here’s what I think so far.25.At first, the scientists were thinking small – and, were trying to take advantage of the samples already tested.  They would have preferred samples from multiple areas over the shroud, but knowing the difficulty of getting approval for such samples, were happy to have SOMETHING.26.Most likely, they would have accepted that the results of using just the one Raes sample would be highly suspect, but under the circumstances, well worth the effort required to obtain them.27.Later, they realized the possibility of obtaining (slightly) more material, and began trying to advance that possibility.28.The Turin workshop of 86 allowed the CARBON DATING LABS to advance their own agenda/preferences – and, “the rest is history.”29.In other words, Scientists did first propose one of the Raes samples, but they did that because they figured that such would be easily allowed by those in charge of the decision (the Church), whereas getting anything more might be impossible.30.Later, when there seemed to be room for enlarging their expectations, scientists of the carbon dating mentality were in control, outvoted the remaining scientists and allowed for only a tiny sample from a highly suspect corner of the Shroud to be their target.","date":"May 21, 2013 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/21/an-open-thread-for-rich-savage-questions/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"An Open Thread for Rich Savage Questions"},{"author":"richard_savage","post":"Challenge #1:– Regarding the carbon dating, several claims have been made as to how the dating could be so far off if the Shroud is authentic.
