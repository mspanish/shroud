No one who thinks that the shroud is real should have any fear of the truth from wherever. The Royal Society would be fairly good at such an undertaking. I also think we might start with the question Colin raises about bloodstains and go from there. Eventually, the question of C14 will need to be addressed. Maybe the Royal Society can get Oxford involved. I do think it is a bit naïve to think that a letter from Colin will do the trick. I therefore propose to start a petition campaign at change.org. The whole shroud community including SSG, BTST and readers of this blog could electronically sign the petition encouraging Paul Nurse to become involved. We could invite CSICOP and other skeptical organizations to sign the petition as well. Get enough groups involved and the media will get involved. BTW: I’m a bit confused. Colin tells us that the “Royal Society’s [has a] current policy of confronting and exposing pseudo science.” As evidence of this he quotes the BBC saying, “Sir Paul believes strongly that scientists have a duty to speak out about science in public life and challenge pseudoscience.” I was not aware that what Nurse opines is ex cathedra policy for the entire society. He must be one powerful dude. Actually, Royal Society policy and policy work including confrontation “is organised around the following four themes.” 1)Sustainability, 2)Diplomacy, 3)Innovation and 4)Governance. I guess we could petition the society to add 5)Icons and Relics..","date":"2013-03-05","mins":"11:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/04/defining-pseudoscience-it-takes-a-rocket-surgeon/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Defining Pseudoscience:  It Takes a Rocket Surgeon"},{"id":"comment-35852","author":"paulette","post":"Has the shroud ever been in Rome?.","date":"2013-06-03","mins":"6:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/06/03/every-year-millions-travel-to-rome-to-view-the-shroud/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Every year, millions travel to Rome to view the shroud . . . ???"},{"id":"comment-214750","author":"paulette","post":"There is of course the Critical Summary of Silliness 3.0 for the strident dematerialists..","date":"2015-11-17","mins":"2:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/16/dematerialization-101/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Dematerialization 101"},{"id":"comment-44622","author":"paulette","post":"Perhaps we should stop boasting with the term peer reviewed.

This isn’t scientific thinking. As a science teacher I would have given one of my 9th graders a failing grade if he turned in something like this. He has lined up the rightmost and leftmost edge of the cloth as though the feet were aligned to those edges. The best he can do is write, “some claim.” Who? What documentation? Forget the fact that hundreds of scientists spent thousands of hours studying the images on the shroud. Compare his “quick play around with my laptop” with the fifteen page paper, “Computerized Anthropometric Analysis of the Man of the Turin Shroud” detailing the real scientific work of Giulio Fanti, Emanuela Marinelli and Alessandro Cagnazzo of the Interdepartmental Center for Space Studies and Activities at the University of Padua.

And Some Comments."},{"id":"comment-16335","author":"paulette","post":"As I wrote before, if Colin can get his complaint about shroud science before the Royal Society it will be wonderful for shroud science. It does seem to me, however, that what Colin is doing, in trying to argue that a faint image is superficial is very unscientific. For the jpeg he has created ( http://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/scorching with time as independent variable1.jpg ) he provides the following caption. “Effect of decreasing temperature v contact time on scorch intensity and likely degree of superficiality”. Likely? Why not examine it with a microscope? “Lacking as I do a microscope,” he writes, “I cannot check for superficiality at a microscopic level, but I see no reason why a scorch image should not show the same superficiality. . .” He then invites others to disprove him. “If anyone who has a microscope disagrees, then they are at liberty to check that assumption.” This would be like a man who upon looking at the surface of a vast lake declares the world is flat and invites anyone who has the means to disagree. This is not how science is done. The ball is in his court. Who does he think he is fooling? He goes so far, doing half of an experiment here and half of an experiment there, without even a microscope, to say that his hypothesis is worthy of being called a theory. Such arrogance is astounding. Dr. Colin Berry, Ph D, lifelong chemist, retired biomedical researcher, “previously Head of Nutrition and Food Safety at FMBRA,” certainly knows someone with access to all manner of microscopes to examine his linen experiments. He could mail his samples to any number of people. Would he trust capable people in the shroud community. If not, there are any number of scientists at CSICOP or JREF who would be delighted to help him. He could, with an index card and a thumb tack, or with the power of Twitter, find dozens of capable college students who would be delighted to prepare some photomicrographs in order to advance the cause of skepticism. Colin could tease apart a lightly scorched thread and see if the image is confined to the top two or three fibrils. He could show us how he is able to remove the discoloration with adhesive tape. And, of course, with photographic images of the coloration, he could show us how truly superficial, and on a scale like the shroud, a heat produced colorization is. Colin alludes to the work of others in his draft of a letter to the president of the Royal Society to complain about the state of shroud science. He alludes to the work others. That is fine. Let me just mention two. Dr. Nicholas P L Allen was quite convinced that the image was a proto photograph. He explained how “after immersion in an ammonia solution, most of the silver is removed from the linen cloth, and the resultant straw yellow image is formed not by the presence of silver but by a structural (chemical) alteration to the linen (cellulose) itself. He championed his hypothesis. He did the work to satisfy himself and to try an convince others. Unfortunately, the full sized image he created does not meet all of the characteristics of the image on the shroud and very few people buy into his hypothesis. Nonetheless, curiously perhaps or because of human nature or something like that, I think he still believes he is right. But he is to be applauded for his efforts. Dr. Luigi Garlaschelli argued that a forger used powdered ochre and a combination of three techniques (frottage, free hand and bas relief rubbing) to form the image. He thought that trace amounts of humic acids, salts and other organic compounds in the ochre chemically etched the cloth leaving an image as the powdered ochre fell away over time. Unfortunately, the full sized image he created does not meet all of the characteristics of the image on the shroud and few people buy into his hypothesis. Nonetheless, curiously perhaps or because of human nature or something like that, I think he still believes he is right. But he is to be applauded for his efforts. By way of contrast Colin writes, “Let me now briefly explain why I feel the time has come for RS members to get involved – as adjudicators between a broad separation in to two rival camps – the major pro authenticity camp that rejects any idea of the Shroud being a thermal scorch, and the “voice crying in the sindonological wilderness” camp – with a present membership of 1 – name appended at end – that says the Shroud image IS simply a thermal imprint, due to direct contact and passage of conducted heat between template and linen.” Curiously perhaps or because of human nature or something like that, I think he believes he is right even though he can do little more than say it seems likely, dare others to prove him wrong or claim to be the new Isaiah of shroud science..","date":"2012-09-16","mins":"5:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/13/an-email-from-colin-berry/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"An Email from Colin Berry"},{"id":"comment-47740","author":"paulette","post":"Why do I feel we are the victims of a super troll?.","date":"2013-10-17","mins":"5:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/17/colin-berry-the-1532-fire-was-no-accident/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Colin Berry: The 1532 fire  was no accident"},{"id":"comment-27126","author":"paulette","post":"Colin Berry has resorted to mean and nasty personal attacks.
