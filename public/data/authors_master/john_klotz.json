A small forensic note: the statute demonstrates that the Man in the Shroud was in a state of rigor mortis (knees bent at time of death). That means that it is likely that the image was transferred to the Shroud within 48 hours of his death. \nLet’s see, under normal circumstances rigor mortis would have been released by 3:00 pm the Sunday after the Friday execution. That’s sometime after the accounts of Mary Magdalene’s discovery of the missing body at day break Sunday morning.\nYet, the impact of this work of art is so awesome, that I don’t want my technical note to distract from the total impact of the work.

It is a factual circumstance that supports authenticity. Any single item of circumstantial evidence rarely “proves” anything. The issue is whether it is consistent with one side of the matter at issue because if its inconsistent it start to point in the opposite direction. It is an accumulation of circumstances that point in the same direction that eventually proves the case..\nThe nudity of Christ in the Shroud image is consistent with the fact of his burial after a nude crucifixion. All that en-wrapped were the burial linens.\nNow how many images of a nude Christ on the cross are there? Is the answer one? or two or even ten?\nHow many original images of Christ with his genitals with a loin cloth. I would hazard a guess that there may be significantly more than 100,000. Now how many reproductions of loin cloth covered genital area are there? There are more than two billion Christians living to day.Counting Rosary reproductions, , sacred icons and even cheesy reproductions of the crucifixion,over the span of nearly two millennia I would suggest there are tens of million if bnot hundreds of millions.\nThe odds that the naked Christ of the Shroud is not unique and attributal to its authenticity claim probably run to at least 100,000 to 1 or .00001. . \nI sometimes find that “true believers” fight the use of reasonable inferences from the evidence because they insist that it be a matter of faith.

The event horizon is the place beyond which observation can not be made but at the horizon there is very much to observe. Observation of the horizon is one way we know the black hole exists,\nFor example, let’s take either dawn or sunset. Before the sun rises we know its coming because the horizon lights up. At dusk, the sun disappears but the horizon remains visible and we know the sun was there.\nIt’s not a perfect analogy by far, but its observation of the effects of a black hole that tells us it’s there. That observation disappears at a point. It’s where it’s the point where the visual effects can no longer be observed that we reach an event horizon. It is not that there is no light in the black hole, it is that light can not escape the gravity of the black hole.\nAs I wrote on my blog concerning the death of my son Michael that death is the ultimate event horizon. See my original comment: http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2007_10_01_archive.html\nwhere I used “event horizon” as a metaphor for death and a second comment where I expand the thought  because of the work  of Stuart Hammeroff. http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2012_08_01_archive.html\nI have an disagreement with some who do not believe that the Resurrection is discoverable.\nIf a physical body processed to something else then it should not be surprising that there are artifacts of the body or the process that were left behind, \nThe image on the Shroud may be an  artifact  of the Resurrection. It is not the glorified body of St. Paul but rather it is the body as the last moment it could be seen. Because we can not see beyond that artifact, it is in at least in  metaphorical or symbolical sense an “event horizon.”\nThen again, as we used to sing in the heady days of Vatican II, “love makes symbols real.”\n\n","date":"October 13, 2013 at 10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-case-you-missed-isabel-piczeks-wonderful-paper/","cat":"art","title":"In case you missed Isabel Piczek’s wonderful paper"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"I thank Hugh  for his comment to my comment.

I think you should note that the label   I ascribed to you is  “scientist.” That was not written by me as “irony” but as recognition of a fact. As far as Jacques de Molay is concerned, I think like Leonardo there is more than one deMolay. There is an historical individual named de Molay and there are all the de Molays of myth. \nTo posit de Molay as the figure on the Lirey badge is to honor a de Molay of myth. I expect that the real deMolay was neither the evil, devil worshipping charicature drawn by King Philip and his henchman nor the secular saint honored by the Masons. I do not think finding the real de Molay is possible. Leonardo was a very complex individual of great genius. There may very well be secrets of himself that he kept. However, was he the champion of an underground stream of heresy and conspiracy? Frankly, I doubt it extends as far as the Leonardo of either Holy Blood, Holy Grail or the da Vinci Code. One I’ve read and one I haven’t. \nThere are mysteries that demand resolution because of their importance. Deciphering Christ is important to this day. I am not sure that decoding da Vinci or de Molay rises to that level of importance. The one I read claims to be history.\nAs some of those who I confide in are aware, I am struggling with an issue of supreme importance to to me and I think posterity. We are deep into what I refer to as to “Apocalypse of Selfishness.” The sixth mass extinction of species is underway. One species extinguished may be us.\nIt just so happens that suddenly on the world stage there appears a personalty who may very well be the one most important voice in leading humanity away from the brink of extinction. He happens to be that most despised of creatures in the view of some de Molay adherents: a Roman Catholic pope.\nWe are a long way from King Philip and de Molay and the Borgias. We are not along way from He who was martyred by selfishness for the answer to the problems we face begin with an extraordinary exercise of selflessness epitomized by Him and recorded on the Shroud of Turin. We have a prophet proclaiming that right now. His name is Francis.

I know of few things on this earth 100% assured except in the words of the American rabble rouser and enemy of the English King Benjamin Franklin who wrote: “‘In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” The labs themselves stated they believed their accuracy was a 95%. \nBut NO ONE is claiming that he coating is what was carbon dated, it was the linen threads that were. The importance of the cotton and the encrustrations was that they were a marker in the Raes and crabon samples of the new (medieval) linen.\nHow much time have you spent examining the Scanning Electronic Microscope photographs of the late John Brown of Georgia Tech published by shroud.com in 2005 a few days after peer-reviewed papers in Thermocheimca Acta papers.\nPeer review, like carbon data, is no 100% guarantee of accuracy, but it is a starting point. Outside of Jull’s silly 2010 paper published by Radiocarobon, a journal of which he was the editor, and the original 1989 Nature article which noted only in its  acknowledgements but did not comment, on a finding of cotton in the sample, is there any other peer reviewed article you are relying on? In fact when you whnen to the communication of the lab that found the cotton cited you find that cotton was “intertwined” with the sample fibers. \nIn any event the findings of Rogers was that the linen was new and this the carbon dating skewed. Future tests when finally allowed can deal with dating issues at the quantum level. In fact the STURP experiments used various tools that depended on the quantum actions of the samples (flouresence for example is the discharge of a photon when the the material is agitated).\nMarcello Truzzi who was the philosopher of “pseudo-skepticism” stated that when you dispute something as not being proved, unless you present evidence of a contrary position, you can not claim the contrary position has been proved, only that the principal proposition has not been proved. Numerous articles [published in peer reviewed journals have demonstrated that the carbon tests were flawed.\nThere is a wealth of material on shroud.com citing sources on the carbon dating which note false, even supercilious dating results.

A Picture of the Shroud in 1036?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"A few weeks ago, I posted a piece about “Clumsy Me” that featured a picture of my dog Bogie. I was a little unhappy with the picture because the perspective of the picture and perhaps the camera lens made his head much larger than the body.\nThe other day while working on a piece of my work in progress, I was struck by an insight that  explains some of the quirkiness that some found in the Shroud image. Bogie’s head in the image is in disproportion to his body. He is sitting and I was taking the picture from above him. The disproportion of the image is essentially an inverted triangle.\nWhat it does is define the angle from which the picture was taken.\nThe disproportion that some see in the Shroud, is not proof that it is a painting, it may be an indication of the angles at which different parts of the image were created. Possibly only one, maybe a couple or more. \nThe proof that the Shroud is not a painting was proved by STURP whose examinations were conducted by devices that functioned at the quantum level. We do not understand yet how it was created. I think the biggest fools of all are art experts who proclaim it a painting. \nTell me art expert: was he the artist left or right handed? A good one can discern that. Where was the light source? What was the directionality of the brush strokes? How did your medieval artist learn about serum halos around blood clots which on the Shroud revealed by X-Rays. Why did he/she add features such as serum halos which were invisible until detected by twentieth century technology?\nPoint is that the “distortions” in the image don’t prove it was a painting. In fact, the variations of proportionality point in the opposite direction.\nSee http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2013/01/clumsy-me-and-shroud-of-turin.html\n\n","date":"March 1, 2013 at 9:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/01/observations-consistent-with-a-medieval-artist/","cat":"art","title":"Observations Consistent with a Medieval Artist?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"This post by Dan is an excellent source of information about the supposed coins in the eyes. You have two items that in my opinion are beyond doubt: blood stains and an image that in general support the Gospel accounts. That’s two points which make a straight line. There is no need of coins.\nOr perhaps it is not a straight line but an arrow pointed towards the Resurrection. I don’t know whether I am bemused or riled by people who claim there could be no physical proof of the Resurrection. What there is  physical proof is of is a bloodied body with the image of a crucified man created within three days of his death. There are accounts that he was resurrected. There are accounts of his appearance after the supposed resurrection but that his appearance had changed. \nThere is the account of Mary Magdalene being the first person he appeared to and his warning her not to touch him because he had not yet gone to the Father. There is an account of St. Paul that he appeared to him in a blinding light.\nHonestly, is there a simpler explanation for these accounts other than he in fact was resurrected?\nAlas, skeptics who can not accept the fact of resurrection must deny it and blind their eyes to the facts before them. Those who claim that science can NEVER “prove” the resurrection underestimate science because it is knocking on the door and that door is the quantum information of the universe (whatever that is).\nPerhaps, the issue will not be solved in our lifetime (or at least mine). It may be decades away.  But two days ago Pope Francis outlined the horrific future awaiting humanity if it does not repent its selfish abuse of the environment.

I am not sure this “debate” among the experts (Zugibe vs. everybody else) is determinative of the essential issue: the authenticity of he Shroud, and beyond that the reality of the Resurrection.\nOccam’s razor is not a scientific principle but a philosophical one. For example, there is no simplest explanation of quantum mechanics. It does have its application in science. For example, the triumph of the Galileo-Newton view over the Ptolemaic view of planetary and solar orbits. \nPtolemy began with the view point that the Earth was the center of the Universe which was really a philosophical-religious theory- revelation. Thus the planets and the sun had to do a little loop in their orbits around the earth. Actually, the mathematics worked pretty well in making predictions of eclipses and such. However, it was simply wrong and it was simply wrong for more than a millennia. However, it was not wrong enough to spare Galileo the Inquisition and the danger of death at the stake.\nNewtonian physics became a philosophical position as well as a scientific one despite the questions it could not answer correctly. In fact that the duality of light as both wave and particle was demonstrated a century before the advent of quantum mechanics. Newtonians were aghast.\nI am not so concerned about how the lash marks were preserved as to when the body parted company with the Shroud. Does this debate have anything to offer on that issue? Although   it is subject to some deviations, to me the most important thing about the image is this: the body of the Man in the Shroud shows signs of rigor mortis and no signs of putrefaction. Rigor mortis begins upon death and is released approximately 48 hours later. The evidence of putrefaction bi-products emerge from the body approximately 48 hours later (there is a relationship between putrefaction of the muscle tisue and the release of rigor mortis.) \nThe time of Christ’s death was Three PM Friday. 48 hours after Christ’s death would have been Three PM Sunday afternoon. Does anybody have any idea what might have happened to Christ’s body during that period of time? I do, and more than a billion people since that time have had the same idea.\nApplying Occam’s Razor to the mystery of the Shroud’s image and the evidence of the blood residue there is one simple explanation: the Resurrection.

There is not a scintilla of evidence of anyone else who could have been the Man in the Shroud. While the New Testaments accounts written several decades after the death of Christs have some inconsistencies, as to the most important facts they are remarkably consistent: Christ died and was  buried.\nSome claim the issue is provenance: where was it? I say the issue is providence? How did it survive with it’s secrets locked in a mysterious image until an Italian photographer unlocked the first one: the image is a negative. Since that initial discovery, in fits and starts science has revealed more of the secrets of image.\nThomas de Wesselow’s remarkable book “The Sign” demonstrates inadvertently the challenge of the Shroud. De Wesselow makes a convincing case for the Shroud’s authenticity but then speculates that the early Christians mistook the Shroud for a risen Jesus. He does so because as an agnostic he can not accept the possibility of the Resurrection.\nThere’s the rub. The reason everyone, included some who believe in authenticity, are reluctant to state a conclusion, is because behind the issue of authenticity lurks the fundamental issue of our existence: the Resurrection.

I felt such a surge of empathy for Him that has only grown as I viewed each revelation.\nI believe that it was in Ian Wilson’s latest book there was a description of Barbet’s work in determining the process of how the nails were driven through the wrist and how excruciating  the pain of that “minor” detail must have been as the nail enlarged the natural passage. And how much more excruciating that pain was than if a nail was driven through the palm as usually depicted. Whatever empathy I felt reading that was a gift of science. But whatever my empathy, I could never actually feel such pain.\nBut knowledge of the Shroud and what it reveals is a gift of Science. That some “scientists” still have eyes that do not see doesn’t detract one wit from the work of the scientists who have brought us this revelation. In my very first catechism lesson more than six decades ago, I was taught that we could never really understand God who was eternal.  I quoted recently from Richard Wright’s Evolution of God. Wright is a professed agnostic but he ended his book describing the human understanding of God as being the merger of truth and love. \nNot a bad parlay at all.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2012 at 5:48 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/02/it-seems-appropriate-to-reflect-on-this-image-of-a-scourged-blood-crowned-nailed-through-the-wrists-and-feet-lifted-up-and-pierced-crucified-man/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"It seems appropriate to reflect on this image of a scourged, blood crowned, nailed through the wrists and feet, lifted up and pierced crucified man"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"It ought to obvious that the readers of this blog represent the diversity of the Christian community. There are profound differences. What brings us together is  the Shroud of Turin.I hope we can respect each other even with our differences as to scripture and accept that there are differences.\n“Biblical exegesis” is a fancy phrase for how you read and interpret the Bible. Many, many biblical scholars are attempting to cull from scripture the nub of reality because much of scripture is metaphor and allegory. Some like John Crosson tend to throw out the baby with the bathwater, particularly on the issue of the Resurrection, but still regard themselves as Christians, Catholics even. Pope Benedict when he was Cardinal Ratzinger described original sin as a great problem for the Church. He rather directly wrote of the origin of Genesis as the compendium of creation myths from other cultures that actually changed in the first milenium BCE and did not reach its current form until the Babylonian captivity. A Howard Professor has written that original sin is original selfishness. I buy that. What we struggle with is the selfish residue of evolution and what marks humanity in Teilhard’s view is when. alone among animals, it developed the awareness of self and introspection.\nFundamentalists may find these ideas a long way from their faith, but it is at its core a deeply understood Christianity.\nWe are not going to agree on theology and some may not even agree on the fact of evolution. Let’s concentrate on the Shroud and it’s message, the declaration of faith: Christ has died, Christ has risen. The third part, Christ will come again, is not a part of our debate for that coming may mean different things to different people.

None of the STURP team were “hired.” Expenses were reimbursed when money was raised but they were not working for a fee. \nThere is an arrogant attitude displayed by the authors in his dismissal of Barrie as a hired photographer. Barrie had a Masters degree from the leading photography school  in the United States and had in fact done complex work with scientists who were dealing with photographs of nuclear explosions and readouts on analytical scientific devices.\nPhotography is in fact an instrument of science. No where is that fact demonstrated more than the Pia photographs and the reactions to them.\nAs there being “no sign of death on these clots” there were plenty of signs of death on the Shroud including the high levels of bilirubin and the seepages from the the wounds particularly the lance wound which has been identified as post-mortem. Then there is the finding of rigor mortis by a slew of pathologists.\nBut there is one thing that troubles me: it’s the authors use of Yiddish argot to depict the words of the scientists. There were Jewish scientists who worked with STURP, they were not a majority of the scientists. They were well-educated and well qualified. Why the use of Yiddish? \nIs the author Jewish seeking to debunk Christ? Or is the author crudely anti-semitic? Or is he simply a Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce fan?\nMuch of contemporary American humor has it roots in the Jewish experience by comedians, who learned and honed their in the Catskills. None of them were a part of the STURP team.\nThen again, I sometimes feel that story of my life is like the punchline of Yiddish joke about a man who was offered a job  by his Rabbi: a shekel a day to sit by the village gate and watch for the Messiah.”The pays not much, but the work is steady,” the Rabbi assured him.\n\n","date":"August 24, 2015 at 5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

However, I think your quote of a “young surgeon” to rebut Bucklin is a bit off the mark if you are seriously pitting his opinion against Bucklin’s.\nYour “young” surgeons statement is not very precise. What does  “length of time” mean. Ten minutes? Two hours, a day?  From the Gospel account we are told that a Roman soldier thrust a lance into Christ’s side and “blood and water” flowed out. What the pathologists have told us is that the water was in fact a clear fluid. It was in fact a signal of his death as the Roman soldiers probably knew from their experience as executioners. Christ was hanging on the cross at the time.\nHow familiar was your young surgeon with the STURP findings and subsequent analysis. Had he scanned it once or twice or did he labor long hours into the night reviewing its multitudinous reports?\nHow many autopsies has your young surgeon done? A ten? A hundred? a thousand? Bucklin had performed thousands. Is Bucklin’s report in inerrant scripture? Of course not. Zugibe has disputed among other things the cause of death as determined by his multiple predecessor pathologists – but Zugibe found a cause of death. He also critiqued the nail through the wrist finding which was frankly a matter of anatomical semantics. \nWhat we come down to is really a question of circumstantial evidence which in other contexts “atheist Pope”  Richard Dawkins as decreed to be superior to eye witness testimony in many cases. The accumulation of circumstances can lead to a conclusion. We do not order our life by proof beyond a reasonable doubt but in the case of the death of the man in the shroud, doubt, in the totality of the circumstances, death is more than reasonable and beyond “reasonable” doubt. Jurors are sometimes told that “reasonable doubt” is a not a doubt “that come in the meddle of the night” but in the light of day.\nIn law we have what are called “curbstone opinions.” That means someone asks a lawyer a question about the law when there is no lawyer-client relationship. When the lawyer answers the questions he often ends with Of course, that’s my curbstone opinion.”What that means is “you are not my client and you can not rely on it.”\nAn opinion identified by someone as only by “young surgeon” is a classic medical “curbstone opinion.” \nIt’s like the guy in his kitchen performing research with his tea kettle. Another example of “curbstone opinions” is Charles Freeman’s unidentified experts who are free with their opinions but OMG don’t cite them by name.\nCircumstantial evidence about Christ is all that we have. The eyewitnesses are long gone.\nIf I am sounding a bit too much like a lawyer, proving facts in real life is what we do. One of those facts often litigated is cause of death. In jurisdictions which still have a death penalty, circumstantial evidence can also cause death.\n\n","date":"August 27, 2015 at 7:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

I have dealt sarcastically with some of the claims made here. For example that the man in the Shroud was actually Jacques de Molay.\nThat is a claim that can be answered with scorn, maybe even satire. \nThe issue of whether Christ was dead or alive is not such an issue becasue it goes to the very heart of Christian belief.\nI did not have the benefit of a “Jesuit” education. In law school one of my colleagues who had attended a Jesuit College stated that he had been told by a Jesuit priest that the only doctrine that was a sine qua non for a Christian was the Resurrection. Now there are some who regard themselves Christian who will argue with that but I think it is a fair statement. \nOthers may disagree and that’s okay for in the final analysis our individual salvation is determined to our fealty to two great commandments of love.\nThe bookend holy days that mark the Christian faith are the nativity which celebrates the transfiguration of the human spirit by the birth of God made man and Easter, which is the hope of our salvation. They have been both satirized cruelly and ignorantly in the past. So when you begin a discussion of the issue of the reality of Christ’s death and Resurrection with a rather crude ethnic patter, that’s just not okay.\nOn the other hand, the reputation of the Islamic sect that has your  adherence is very okay.

Best bet is probably only one, but I would like to be challenged on that with specific cases if they exist. Saying there MAY have been others when there is no historical evidence of any others in that time period does not create doubt, reasonable or otherwise.\nYes, there were other individuals who claimed to be the Messiah, but how many were crucified by the Romans circa 30 CE (AD). The Roman historian Tacitus noted that “Christus” was executed by Pontius Pilot at that time period but that the execution didn’t put an end to his superstition which spread to Rome where 20 or so years later Nero launched his persecution of the Christians that ultimately took the lives of Peter and Paul.\nIS THERE ANY OTHER CULT WHICH SPREAD TO ROME AFTER ITS FOUNDER WAS EXECUTED BY PONTIUS PILATE?

But every year in the United States where the standard is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, people are convicted of crimes and sometimes executed on the basis of circumstantial evidence.  We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The circumstances are such that they establish the authenticity of the Shroud, and, I believe, beyond REASONABLE doubt.\nReasonable doubt is a not a lingering suspicion that comes in the middle of the night. Where the facts point so strongly in one direction, reasonable doubt must then be based on facts. When evidence is adduced that a certain event probably happened, doubt not based on facts is not reasonable.\nThere is no authentic doubt about the Shroud once it is established that it is a linen cloth that once enwrapped the body of a crucified man who was scourged, beaten, nailed to a cross   and his side pierced with a post-mortem (after death) spear wound. There is even evidence that he carried the cross-bar on his shoulders and walked through streets that had limestone stone dust compatible with the streets of Jerusalem. There is also evidence that he fell and because he was carrying the cross-bar, he couldn’t break his fall, injuring a knee and the tip of his nose.\nThe accumulation of facts is overwhelming.

I will give my inexpert answers and hopefully maybe someone with specific expertise can correct me,\n1. What is an artistic convention?\nI believe an artistic convention is that something is portrayed in a similar way across a series of works so that eventually with a specific class or culture, it is portrayed in the same way.\nFor example during the medieval ages, the crucified Christ was pictured with the nails driven through his hands and with a crown of thorns being a simple wreath.\nThose of course are not the conclusions drawn by most when analyzing the Shroud of Turin.\n2. Doesn’t a convention have to start some where with a singular representation, or does it simply blossom all at once in many different places with no single origin?\nI would suggest that a convention begins with a single model or inspiration that is then copied and spread.\n3. Do disparate conventions have  disparate origins?\nFor example, The Shroud of Turin shows no whip wounds on the chest.(Flogging with a whip on the chest would hasten death and possibly deny the executioners their crucifixion) Yet crucifixion renditions show flogging or lashes wounds on the chest. Am I correct that the Shroud does not?\n4. Would it be fair to expect that oldest representation of any particular convention would be the first?\n5. If all but one representation of a convention are paintings or works of art, and one isn’t and apparently predates the paintings or other works of art, is fair to say that the non-painting probably is the source of the convention?\n6. Am I being too obvious?\nWell, maybe so, but the origins of conventions that mimic the Shroud of Turin is, as many have already pointed out  (Vignon and Wilson among others) that supports an early date for the Shroud,\n\n","date":"October 20, 2013 at 9:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/20/an-intriguing-9th-century-image-suggestive-of-the-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-max-patrick-hamon/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Intriguing 9th Century Image Suggestive of the Shroud – A Guest Posting by Max Patrick Hamon"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"I hate to sound like a lawyer, but then I am one.

But when taken in conjunction with other representations, it points i a direction. There is enough uniqueness about the Shroud image that the appearance of its unique features in other works tends to  indicate its antiquity and thus its highly probable authenticity.\nBecause it is not a painting and was not created by ANY known process, it also points in the direction of the Resurrection.\nApplying the much applied, and misapplied Occam’s Razor, the Resurrection may actually be the simplest solution.

Coupled with the report that Oxford had discovered yellow cotton fibers entangled with the linen (as published in the BSTS), it appears that Oxford in doing its testing removed (a) cotton fibers and (b) probably black threads which were the indication  of repairs by Valfre but would have appeared as random contamination to scientists who were totally at sea about the history of the Shroud when it was owned by the Savoys.\nSomeone pointed out to me yesterday that the problem with the edges being frayed was not just the rough handling by the bishops but also the simple fact that the the Savoys were cutting pieces from the corner edges as relics for favored individuals. It appears that pieces from the Shroud edge were virtually parts of the dowry of Savoy princesses.\nWhen I first examined the Shroud photos closely one of the most striking thing was the very  visible, large rectangular pieces  from two corners of the Shroud, Those cuttings may have caused unraveling of the linen that had to be repaired. More so, perhaps, than the bishops.\nRogers obviously could not carbon date the fibers that he had but he was able to discover important differences in composition between the fibers from the test area and the main body of the cloth.

Turin and the Vatican felt burned, even betrayed. Emanuella Marinelli quotes Gonella has saying; “We were blacked mailed” on a presenation to the 2012 Valnecia Conference.]\nThis is from my book which is the personal recollection of Rolfe’s   contacts with Gonella prior to the formal announcement of the labs and the procedures for cutting the sample:\n“In May, Rolfe met with Gonella in Turin. Gonella informed him about changes in protocol that were going to be made. Rolfe was aghast. The ground had shifted. As he later noted:”\n “’All the meticulous preparations for the test were set aside. It was almost as if they didn’t care anymore.\n“‘They just abandoned all the protocols that had been agreed to by the international team of scientists, cut one sample from the corner (instead of seven from different areas), and sent it off to three arbitrarily selected laboratories (instead of blind and controlled tests to the world’s leading seven laboratories)\n“’Luigi was pale and apologetic. Hours before my [Rolfe’s] arrival he had been instructed ‘from above’ to abandon the protocols, scale back the tests and to allow just three of the labs to have a sample selected at random on the day. This was in sharp contrast to seven labs testing samples taken from several different strategically selected areas Even more disappointing from my point of view was the absence of anything binding on the labs to coordinate publication. De facto, the method of sampling would also make any real claim for the tests being done blind meaningless’.”\n“On June 5, 1987, Rolfe wrote his collaborators informing them that as far as he was concerned, the\ngame was over. Father Rinaldi was shattered.”\n\n","date":"April 22, 2015 at 10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/20/carbon-date-the-shroud-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Carbon Date the Shroud Again?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Louis,\nYou venture into the corridors of Vatican intrigue at your own risk.

A pseudo-skeptic is one who pretends to be open minded when asking questions but in fact is seeking to validate a contrary, pre-existing belief.  I would suggest that the “atheist pope” Richard Dawkins is also the world’s leading pseudo-skeptic because he seeks to validate his atheism. The existence of any God is beyond question to him. There is no god and that’s that. Thus he discards everything in scripture. He may seem to hedge, but he uses too many semantic tricks. There’s the way he treats Teilhard in the God Delusion for example.\nBut now to your main point (I think).\nI really can’t spend much time debating. The STURP team examined the Shroud with extremely precise optical instruments. Rogers found no gum arabic encrustations on the rest of the Shroud and no vanillin which was found on the samples from Raes and the carbon dating sample. \nI would recommend that you read Emanuella Martinella’s paper submitted at the 2012 Valencia conference.

Without the bile it would be simply  baloney, although equally indigestible.)\nThis item from a trade textile journal Textile Horizons that did not emanate from any source remotely connected with STURP or even the BSTS. The lab was in fact was contracted for the examination by Oxford (which incidentally was late in reporting its carbon dating results).\nThe only mention of cotton appearing in the samples  simply appears at the end of the Nature article, buried amidst numerous acknowledgements:\n“We thank Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero for allowing us access to the shroud, Professor L. Gonella for his help and support throughout the project and Professor A. Bray for commenting on our statistical assessment of the data. We also thank Miss E. Crowfoot, T. G. H. James, Dr J. Evin, M.

Also note that P.H. South is cited by name. Further note that in the Textile Horizon’s article, Mr. South excludes the possibility of what they observed being a casual contamination but hypothesizes that it indicates a repair of the Shroud or a combining of the cotton with linen at the time the linen was spun. And the cotton was yellow,\nAnd the reaction of the Dr. Berry: invective attacking the STURP scientists who had nothing to do with the carbon dating and apparently alleging that with maniacal cleverness they wore cotton gloves so that the Shroud would be contaminated.\nI deeply regret the time I have spent drafting this reply. But history teaches that idiocy and histrionics can not be ignored for as Mark Twain once wrote: A lie travels halfway around the world while truth is putting on its shoes.”  The truth as known in 1988, I submit, is there was cotton in the samples, it was not casual contamination, and a least one of carbon dating laboratories noted that fact but was rushing to complete the testing because they were late.\nThat may not  decide the issue.

Apparently either I have totally lost my ability to communicate a rational idea or Charles Freeman is not an advertisement for the intellectual prowess of of Cambridge graduates.\nIt’s very simple: Different methods of bleaching leave different artifacts. In the case of the linen used on the Shroud it left bands of darker color which obvious on the Shroud.\nOkay, so people have been bleaching things for maybe 8,000 years or so. They all didn’t do it the same way, And the method some used might not leave artifacts of the process. In the case of the method used in ancient times on the Shroud it caused banding when different batches were used in the object.. \nNow, I will conceded that the process that caused banding nay have proceeded longer than I thought. One expert wrote a book and said it might have been used to 1250 at the outside. His name was Ray Rogers. But not after that. Benford-Marino relied on an Oxford text to say that it stopped circa 300-400 CE.\nNow even taking Rogers figure of 1250 as the outside that would be the latest date for a forgery and there is no evidence that by  1250 the technology existed to forge the Shroud. In fact, there is now evidence that the technique to forge the Shroud did not exist by 2013 qand it is very doubtful it will exist in 2050 although maybe you never know about the the future.\nWhat the banding does demonstrate is that the method used to dye the linen existed at the time of Christ. If it did not THAT would be evidence of in-authenticity. The Holland cloth linen did not exhibit bands. That’s because in Holland they developed a method of bleaching that did not lead to banding. The Holland cloth was used by the Poor Clare nuns who repaired the Shroud in circa 1534.\nBut I can not understand how a supposedly educated man does not understand that different methods of bleaching might leave different artifacts of one kind or another. The banding is such an artifact and do not insult everyone’s intelligence by claiming hat the banded dyed linen in the Shroud is indistinguishable from any other method of dying. \nReally guys and gals, I do not believe that I am that inarticulate and neither was Benford./Marino or Rogers. There may be a disagreement when the dying process used on the Shroud stopped being used, but if any body has any evidence it was used after 1250 I’d like to see it. “Well, maybe” unless backed by facts doesn’t hack it.\nI have finished the draft of Chapter 12. Now onto the short but very serious Chapter 13: Sunrise, Sunset, Sunrise.

If you really care to learn about it, do a little research. You know, on the Internet. But frankly I am too busy to deal with either feigned or actual ignorance from someone who is perfectly capable of finding the answer himself, or herself. If it’s too much bother, don’t bother.\nIf you have contrary authority let me know. I’d like to see it. As a matter of fact after your intial message, and you pointed out that the Oxford reference might not in fact not cover linen cloths like the Shroud, I did in fact do a little research and found out that in his book, a Chemist’s Perspective, Ray Rogers placed the last possible date for bleach bands to be 1250 CE. And he had consulted with an expert. He wasn’t  writing in a vacuum.  I am satisfied with the information I have.

To say that people have been bleaching for 6,000 years is to dodge the question.  There were different methods bleaching and some of the earliest methods gave uneven results so that when a larger object was made from linen  bleached by the early processes bands were created. Evidence wise, it’s akin to fingerprints. Were there no bands that would be evidence casting doubt on the authenticity of the Shroud.\nIf somone were to claim hat he had an oil painting of Julius Ceasar that he posed for while alive, you would laugh at him. Oil paintings for art was not used by the Romans. (Am I wrong?)\nIf you want to say you don’t have time to study the issue, I’ll understand that. If you want to point out an inaccuracy, I’ll accept that. What is unacceptable is to write that bleaching has been done for thousands of years so it makes no difference.\nHave you ever given forensic evidence in court? Some art experts have. Trying to determine the province of a work of art can be worth tens (if not hundreds) of millions of ddollars. cf  La Principessa.\nYour answer wouldn’t fly. Usually, the argument is that science demands absolute answers and legal  standards such as beyond reasonable doubt do not apply in the august chambers of science. I think that’s nonsense  of course. As I have written: “We do not order our lives by proof beyond reasonable doubt.” I also have written: “Fear the person who has no doubt. Witness George Armstrong Custer.”\nThe issue is whether the Shroud linen shows characteristics of an ancient pre-medieval bleaching process. The Holland Cloth which is clearly of medieval origin, unlike the Shroud in chief shows no banding and it is clearly medieval having been added to the Shroud circa 1532. The fact the Shroud itself shows banding is an indication that it pre-dates medieval. It may not be a 100% solution. But even if it’s 50-50, it’s an indication. \nThe fact the bleaching process of the linen in the Shroud dates to the time of Christ is a fact about the Shroud. It certainly doesn’t eliminate all possibilities. If the Shroud was pristine of bands, that would be evidence of medieval manufacture. \nIt is not a decisive fact as to the ultimate issue but it is a fact to be taken into account.\nMaybe, if I ever stop being distracted by the blog, I’ll get my manuscript done :-) Actually, I appreciate this interchange because it helps be sharpen my work.\nThank you.\n\n","date":"December 16, 2013 at 5:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/disappearing-shaded-bands/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Disappearing Shaded Bands"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"David, \nThe individual who took those pictures assured me the banding was not on the Holland cloth.\n\n","date":"December 16, 2013 at 9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/15/disappearing-shaded-bands/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Disappearing Shaded Bands"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Here’s the problem with the whole issue of “contamination.” It depends on the definition. In common parlance, we think of mold, or spilled milk, coffee, stain, bioplasitc coating maybe insects debris. It some unintended chemical process. \nHowever, what Rogers found, and what all the contamination experts ignore, that what occurred with reweaving is NOT contamination as the word is commonalty understood. The reweaving process included new threads of cotton AND NEW THREADS OF LINEN (new being medieval). Cotton dyed yellow was interwoven and spliced with NEW threads of linen because linen does not dye well. \nMay I venture a statement which I would certainly like to see a rebuttal: how does new linen test older? If we were discussing mold or something like that (a coffee spill) that might be empirically demonstrable. But it is a semantic trick to call cotton spliced into new linen “contamination.”\nI really don’t have the time for a week or so to get into this. However, I really believe if someone is asserting that new linen interwoven in the Shroud samples would give an older date that the original linen, I really have to examine his data. I would suggest though what is needed is an examination of his definition.\nI must admit that the implication of Rogers finding new linen fibers didn’t really sink in at first, so if any scientists overlooked that then I understand. But if he/she  deliberately ignored that then shame on him/her.\nAlso, Only testing of the fiber samples from the sample area can answer the question. That was done by Rogers and the colleagues who he asked to review his work.\nMaybe Hugh or someone can advise us whether the his experts took into account the interweaving of dyed cotton with the new linen as a part of the repair which Donna Campbell has demonstrated from examination of the Oxford photograph. Pam Moon has described the repair process. It did happen.

Undoubtedly, some of this “contamination” was removed by the labs in preparing the sample for incineration which is how the tested carbon was created.\nI am also stunned by the ferocity of the skeptics who seem to ignore the findings of Rogers, Villarreal and the photographs of John Brown.\n\n","date":"March 24, 2015 at 4:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/22/do-the-blue-quad-mosaics-tell-a-different-story-than-we-think/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Do the Blue Quad Mosaics tell a different story than we think?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"And Hugh, where is the evidence of “glue’?

Hugh is right.\nThere was an unfortunate blow-up between Rogers and Jackson becasue Rogers sharply criticized a Jackson article on image formation. I think that colors the live Jackson critique of the reweaving-repair thesis. At St. Louis, Jackson who was supposed to moderate a panel discussion began with what I believed was a disingenuous description of the Rogers findings [not by name] on the composition of the sample area.\nIt wasn’t just cotton contamination, but a finding the linen fibers in the samples were new [medieval] linen not created from flax by the same methods used circa 30 CE. In fact, the procedures to turn flax into linen used on the fibers of the main body of the shroud ceased circa 1000 CE. \nThus a dispute about how much the sample area was “contaminated” as that word is commonly understood begs the question of how many new linen fibers were used to repair the frayed edge of the Shroud circa 1500 or so,\nAlso, one huge point: the cotton fibers that Oxford found and discarded before the sample was destroyed were “yellow.” I have seen cotton fields in the US and I don’t recall seeing any yellow cotton just a lot of white balls of cotton natural in the fields. Linen does not dye well and Rogers thesis is that the yellow cotton strands were inter woven to give the fibers color that matched the aged kinen which was graudally darkening (light pollution anyone?)\nRogers also conceded that the Maynard reaction was not an complete explanation of the image formation process. There was something else.\nI would point out in my inexpert opinion based upon my human observations, there is one source of radiation that can cause color changes without destroying its object. It’s called light. Museums must sometime guard their treasures against light pollution. When the Mona Lisa was subjected to multi-spectral digital imaging, the company that did it had to use special light sources designed to safe guard the Mona Lisa from the light.\n“He was the light of the world, and the light shone  in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it.”\n\n","date":"April 25, 2015 at 7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/look-at-what-happened-between-1988-and-2015/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Look at what happened between 1988 and 2015"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Angel,\nThanks for correcting me.

The following is an excerpt from my book that cites an item by Ian Wilson from the BSTS Newsletter published in 1990.\n“The first intimation of the dangling cotton thread came to the Shroud world in an article by Ian Wilson in the September-October 1990 issue of the BSTS Newsletter entitled “Cotton On The Oxford Carbon Dating Sample:\n“Kindly brought to our attention by the Revd. Kim Dreisbach of Atlanta is a hitherto unnoticed report in the journal Textile Horizons of December 1988 concerning the Shroud sample supplied to the Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratory. Apparently the British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd of Ambergate, Derbyshire was asked by the Oxford laboratory to help identify certain ‘foreign’ fibres observed, isolated and extracted from the Shroud sample prior to its destruction during the carbon dating process. \n“According to Precision Processes managing director, Peter South:\n“‘It was while the sample was undergoing tests at the radiocarbon acceleration unit in Oxford that Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place. He mentioned this to his friend Sir James Spooner, chairman of Coats Viyella, to which our firm belongs. Consequently, after several telephone calls, the minute samples, which looked like human hair, were sent to us.’ \n“Magnified two hundred times by a Precision Processes microscope the fibres became immediately identified as cotton. This might have been explicable as merely from the cotton gloves worn by members of the STURP team in 1978, but for the subsequent information imparted by Peter South:”\n‘The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old. Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ \n“This is not the first time that cotton strands have been identified on a Shroud sample. The Belgian Professor Gilbert Raes observed the same on the sample he studied in 1973, and he deduced that this was a strong indication of Middle Eastern manufacture. Clearly it could be of great interest to learn more both of the age of this cotton, and of the exact reason for its presence on the Shroud.”\n“BSTS Newsletter No. 26 – September/October 1990 (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n26part6.pdf)”\nPlease note the phrase “bound-in.”\nThis was not random surface contamination. And please note that Oxford knew this before the release of the carbon dating results. The red lights were flashing and the siren was blaring. For the labs to have stepped back a bit and dealt with this in their report would have resulted not only in a delay in a releasing their results and probably required a whole new sampling, something that would have virtually impossible to happen.\nIn The Sign, de Wesselow wrote:\n“The carbon dating of the Shroud will probably go down in history as one of the greatest fiascos in the history of science. It would make an excellent case study for any sociologist interested in exploring the ways in which science is affected by professional biases, prejudices and ambitions, not to mention religious (and irreligious) beliefs.”\n“Fiasco” was a gross understatement. \nhttp://johnklotz.blogspot.com\n\n","date":"March 5, 2015 at 6:59 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Hugh,\nWhat you either don’t understand, or ignore, is that Rogers found that the linen in the samples was at least in part “new linen” with different attributes than the linen in the main body of the Shroud.

Of course not.

I can’t imagine that no one will refer him to the paper of Flury-Lemberg which refutes Rogers after her close- up examination of this corner of the Shroud, something never achieved by Marino or Benford.\n“Anyway no harm in John in trying.”\nTo the very best of my knowledge your statement was factually incorrect. Flury-Lemberg never examined the close-up “this corner of the Shroud and her statement about that all the Shroud having the same content predated the carbon dating by two years.\nI would have no knowledge about your basis for that false statement. But others in this thread have pointed out the simple truth that she never had an opportunity to examine personally the pieces cut for carbon sampling. \nI would ask that you CITE AND QUOTE in this thread the specific authority upon which you rely in making your factual assertion. If she examined the photographs of the cut samples she is no better position than Benford-Marino and the experts they consulted or Pam Moon and the expert she consulted who is cited in my Finding Jesus critique. There are pictures of the Oxford carbon sample taken before it was destroyed during the carbon dating process. A source for viewing that sample is cited in my Finding Jesus review. Also cited is Pam Moon’s article on the history of mending of the Shroud by Valtre. In the photograph that black threads. Pam explains their cognizance.\nYour first reference to Flury-Lemberg is sufficient to justify my critique. But you did repeatedly refer to her in the thread. I have recounted the number of times you referred to Flury-Lemberg in this context. The recount shows six times. Given the factual claim you made which was false, I do not believe that is a significant fact. It is, as they say, “de minimus.” \nMy book has over 500 footnotes. The review of “Finding Jesus” published on Shroud.com is 14 pages with 31 footnotes. Included as to point in question is a reference to harry Gove’s memoir and an E-Mail from Prof. William Meacham responding to an inquiry whether he recalled Fleury-Lemberg making her statement in 1986 at the conference referenced by Gove. He confirmed that and then added his interchange with Al Adler.\nNow its time for me to compliment Professor Goodacre and I sent him a copy of it. I believed, that in fairness, I should inform him of my critique. His response – given my turgid review – was very professional and in good humor. He suggested that I comment on another blog which advocates the Shroud’s medieval fabrication. I checked the site and it appears that the author relied upon the claims of Walter McCrone. The blogger is ludicrous. If you would like, E-Mail me and I would be send you a copy of my Chapter 9 (free of charge) which demonstrates that. The offer is open to anyone.\nI begin the Chapter 9 with a quotation from Revelations:\n“These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have\nwashed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”\nBuried in the chapter is a description drawn from Heller’s memoir of his actions upon returning from first post-Turin STURP conference:\n“Saturday, he returned to work, put on his white lab coat and went down the hall to the microscope lab and repeated the examinations, this time using his favorite Leitz microscope.”\nI didn’t emphasize the relationship of that comment to the initial quote from Revelations hoping that readers would discover it for themselves. As far as I am concerned, the entire STURP team “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”\n\n","date":"April 4, 2015 at 7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles,\nHave you bothered to examine the sources I have cited to you which included an in depth examination of the photograph of Oxford sample BEFORE  it was destroyed in the carbon dating process and an explanation of the history of Shroud repairs.\nHere they are again:\n27http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Thomas_Ferguson_files/Updated_report_on\n_the_Consideration_to_the_Uniformity_and_Effects_of_the_Fabric_in_the_Shroud_of_Turin-5-1.pdf\n28http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Three_threads_files/BL%20Sebastian%20for%2\n0website%201.pdf\nI have also cited two sources for the fact that in 1986, Flury-Lemberg stated that the Shroud was “all the same in composition.” One was Harry Gove’s memoir on the Shroud and the other was  E-Mail correspondence with Prof. William Meacham who suffers from a disability that both you and I lack: He was actually at the protocol 1986 protocol conference when she made the statement. He also added an additional bon mot: that Adler at the same conference remarked to him that Flury-Lemberg “obviously knew nothing about chemistry of the cloth.”\nAdler, incidentally, unlike you or I, actually had the opportunity to inspect an analyze fiber from the carbon sample area that had been held back by Turin when the carbon sample was cut and were supplied to him through the good graces of Prof. Gonella, the scientific advisor of the Turin Archbishop. That were later supplied to Ray Rogers. See http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerpaper.pdf\nI have challenged you or anybody else to tell me when Flury-Lemberg had an opportunity to physically examine the Shroud BEFORE the carbon samples were removed and destroyed and you haven’t done that. The evidence is she would have had no such opportunity. Also, I sincerely doubt she, unlike Pam Moon and linen expert Donna Campbell of the Thomas Ferguson firm, does not appear to have ever examined Oxford photograph. In fact, I am informed, and could be corrected, that Ms. Moon had to pry the photograph away from Oxford by the British equivalent of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.\nI will concede one point right now: the Campbell analysis does not state that repairs were made before 1355. For the existence of the Shroud before than we have to look for other sources. One of them is Flury-Lemberg because I assume that you did not in any of your effusive praise for her intentionally overlook the fact that she asserts the authenticity of the Shroud. In fact she has identified stitching of the side seam of the Shroud as reflective of stitching seen in remnants from the Masada which would perforce be evidence of its existence circa 74 CE. \nIn my CNN review, I also cite the evidence of the Shroud’s existence circa 500 CE; in exposition in Constantinople circa 1200 CE and its “fingerprints” seen in the Pray Manuscript circa 1200 CE. \nIs the evidence circumstantial, of course. However, Richard Dawkins, himself a Shroud skeptic, argues that circumstantial evidence is often more reliable than eyewitness accounts. Dawkins, Richard , pp. 15-16, 106, “Greatest Show on Earth,” Free Press. Kindle Edition. In fact. in my discussion in Chapter 1 of “Quantum Christ” (Rules of the Road) I demonstrated that from just two facts in the third verse of the Ira Gershwin lyrics to “I Can’t Get Started,” Gershwin was twitting i.e. “jerking the chain”  of Joseph Kennedy, whose son John was later elected President of the United States.\nFinally, there is the excellent presentation in de Wesselow’s “The Sign.” As an agnostic he refuses to concede the realty of the Resurrection but as to authenticity of the Shroud, he has no doubt.\nI understand that you have differences with de Wesselow who had the temerity to write his book without consulting you. Or did he?\n\n","date":"April 6, 2015 at 6:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"No one has their hands tied.

Our\ngeneration and the two that preceded it have heard little but talk of the\nconflict between science and faith; indeed it seemed at one moment a\nforegone conclusion that the former was destined to take the place of the\nlatter. But, as the tension is prolonged, the conflict visibly seems to need to be\nresolved in terms of an entirely different form of equilibrium — not in\nelimination, nor duality, but in synthesis. After close on two centuries of\npassionate struggles, neither science nor faith has succeeded in discrediting its\nadversary. On the contrary, it becomes obvious that neither can develop\nnormally without the other. And the reason is simple: the same life animates\nboth. Neither in its impetus nor its achievements can science go to its limits\nwithout becoming tinged with mysticism and charged with faith.” \nTeilhard, Pierre de Chardin; Huxley, Julian; Wall, Bernard (2011-06-21).

STURP also proposed that the C-14 test be concurrent with new tests to following-up on its 1978 tests. \nIn the end, the C-14 labs objected to anymore tests because the C-14 would determine if they were necessary. STURP was kicked out of the process altogether. The Labs argued that  if the C-14 determined that the Shroud was medieval, then there wouldn’t be a need for further tests. I kid you not.

That’s because as things now stand the creation of the image is  subsidiary issue to the issue of authenticity of the Shroud. That, in my very humble opinion, has been demonstrated. The issue of its history in the lost years is also a subsidiary issue. The Shroud itself is proof of it’s authenticity. The fact that no one can replicate the image doesn’t detract from that and the fact that one theory or another about image creation is proven or dis-proven EXCEPT to the extent that failure to account for it by known science or artistry supports the uniqueness and supernatural aura of the Shroud.\nThe DEMONSTRATED physical facts of the Shroud support one rational conclusion: that it is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. No alternative has been proposed except that there might have been some other individual crowned with thorns and crucified, his body was removed from his burial cloth with three days of his death. The probability of that the facts apply to someone else is so remote I can not count the zeros.\nThe reason that probability is so small is that we have four accounts of Christ’s death based on oral and written traditions that state the facts of his death and none of anyone else dying in a like manner. His death was important enough to be noted by the Roman historian Tacitus who was aghast that Pontius Pilate had failed to eradicate the Christus superstition. However, the letters of St. Paul pre-date Tacitus’ Annals of Ancient Rome.\nWe now have three highly regarded scientists or academics trumpeting the need for no God and professing their belief that nothing preceded the Universe: Dawkins, Hawking and Krauss.\nAm I misquoting them? Sort of. Actually they do not so much as proclaim that “nothing” preceded the universe as proclaiming they don’t care  about that “nothing.”\nMaybe I shouldn’t quote Martin Luther King but Bill Clinton: “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.”  It  depends on what the meaning of “nothing” is.

Most of it\nhappened before we were born, and in any case it is usually\ntoo slow to be seen during an individual’s lifetime. The same\nis true of the relentless pulling apart of Africa and South\nAmerica, which occurs, as we shall see in Chapter 9, too\nslowly for us to notice. With evolution, as with continental\ndrift, inference after the event is all that is available to us, for\nthe obvious reason that we don’t exist until after the event.”\nDawkins, Richard (2009-09-18) (pp. 15-16). Free Press.\nKindle Edition.\nThen, Dawkins goes on to make an intriguing analogy:\n“We are like detectives who come on the scene after a crime\nhas been committed. The murderer’s actions have vanished\ninto the past. The detective has no hope of witnessing the\nactual crime with his own eyes. In any case, the gorilla-suit\nexperiment and others of its kind have taught us to mistrust\nour own eyes. What the detective does have is traces that\nremain, and there is a great deal to trust there. There are\nfootprints, fingerprints (and nowadays DNA fingerprints\ntoo), bloodstains, letters, diaries.

They are available for viewing. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf\nIn addition, after Roger’s death, a group of scientists at Los Alamos did further tests on the Raes fibers. \nAnd there is more. After Rogers ‘death, Barrie Schwortz contacted Robert Villarreal who had been given a Raes fiber by Rogers because he wanted a check on his work through an independent analysis. He hadn’t heard from Rogers but after Schwortz contacted him, Villarreal and his associates conducted a series of tests which the results of which they reported to the 2008 Ohio conference and later at the 2012 Valencia Conference. The Valencia report is reproduced at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf\nThe Ohio report may be found here: http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm\nMed. Lemberg also stated that there was cotton throughout the Shroud I believe. However, other than transient cotton debris some of which may have come from the gloves of the STURP team, they could not find cotton on the parts they examined and were puzzled by Raes findings. Rogers had samples both Raes and the main body of he Shroud. They were different. \nThen there is the fact that prior to he release of the C14 results, Oxford was informed of the presence of interwoven cotton in a sample sent by Oxford to Precision Process. It was not transient debris. In the carbon 14 report of the C14 labs published in Nature, buried in the acknowledgements was the following: \n“Oxford thank P. H. South (Precision Process (Textiles) Ltd, Derby) for examining and identifying the cotton found on the shroud sample..” \nIt was the only mention of cotton anywhere in the C14 Report. \nSouth, the head of Precision reported that cotton found on the Oxford sample was:\n‘The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of\nEgyptian origin and quite old. Unfortunately it is impossible\nto say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically\nmade from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some\ntime in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen\nfabric was woven.’\nYou can of course choose whatever “expert” you want that agrees with your bias but the physical evidence that cotton as interwoven in the Raes and adjacent carbon sampling sites is there for your examination in the microphotos of Rogers and John Brown. There is no physical evidence of interwoven cotton in the main body of the Shroud.\nThis is a rather long comment.

I think I indicated before in an earlier post, that may be an intermediary and if the fury of commentary, I failed to reiterate that, then the purpose of the blog in focusing a paticipant on the story he is telling is very valuable. I have  said on occasion, the real tragedy of Teilhard de Chardin is that the Church by directing him nor to publish during his life time, denied him the opportunity to have is ideas debated and rethought in light of criticism. Otherwise, without publication, we are to paraphrase LBJ, “hollering down a rain barrel. \nIt  may have escaped notice but I did offer a description of the bind we may be in as to authenticity. I indicated that Gonella was dead and ray was dead but that there was an intermediary who has refused to come forward. I am for now not at liberty to name him or her because I regard the conversation where I learned that as confidential and I can not betray that confidentiality.\nHowever, there is something that is not confidential at all. Unlike the  Turin reaction to Fanti, Turin had a distinctly different reaction to Rogers peer-reviewed 2005 article. Indeed, it rebuked one Turin personality who attacked Rogers and fond his article useful for future scientific investigation.\nOne of the really important items on Shroud.com is a chronology of the C-14 controversy compiled by Joe Marino and Ed Prior. For anyone interested in the controversy it is a must read. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/chronology.pdf\nItem #37 concerns Rogers 2005 paper and the reaction to it. (pp.20-21)\nIt relevant part (on page 21) covers the reaction to Rogers 2005 paper both here and abroad, particularly in Turin. First he was criticized by Msg. Ghiberti but the rebuttal to Ghiberti came, not from Rogers but “The Diocesan Commission for the Holy Shroud (in Turin)”\n“Physicist and artist Isabel Piczek wrote ―It is not good enough just to look (with the naked eye) for a re-woven patch. It is an invisible reweave, which requires microscopic and microchemical analysis (to discover). Rogers‘ paper has to be accepted. New discoveries always cause lots of controversy, but (Roger‘s report) should be trusted because it was published in a peer-reviewed journal (as cited by Muldoon, Shena. ―Was the Dating a Hoax?‖ Inside the Vatican, 13:2 [March 2005], pg. 25). Even after this data was released, Turin‘s Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti told an Italian newspaper, “I am astonished that an expert like Rogers could fall into so many inaccuracies in his article.” However, a short time after that, The Diocesan Commission for the Holy Shroud released another statement, saying that the study of Rogers was “very interesting” and would be the basis for a future study “on the chemical characteristics of the cloth and its possible inhomogeneity‖ (as cited in Muldoon, Shena. ―Was the Dating a Hoax?‖ Inside the Vatican, 13:2 [March 2005], pg. 25.) It cannot be emphasized enough that insofar as he was the only person to have access to main Shroud samples and samples from the C-14 sample area, Roger‘s judgment should carry enormous weight. To see Rogers‘ impressive resume, go to: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogersresume.pdf .\nFrom page 34, Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin (Barrie Schwortz, Colorado, 2008) (Available at Lulu.com):\n“The results of analyses on the Raes sample made it appear that the radiocarbon sample that was cut for dating in 1988 was not valid (Chapter IX). This naturally caused another controversy. The only way to settle the validity question was to obtain some threads from the authentic radiocarbon sample. However, in dealing with Shroud problems, every sample must be documented without any gaps. I finally received a documented sample of radiocarbon yarn segments, both warp and weft, on 12 December 2003. Professor Luigi Gonella had pulled these segments from “the center of the sample” in 1988 at the time of sampling. Their history was known from that date.” \nSchwortz was the “publisher” of Rogers posthumous  book and, along with Rogers’ wife,  was carrying out Rogers’ dying request. The words are Rogers’.\nFrom Thermacimica Acta \n“On 12 December 2003, I received samples of both warp and weft threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella had taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. Gonella reported that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.”\nPlease note, that in neither of these statements does Rogers say he received the threads “from” Gonella.”\nThere is no evidence that Rogers received them without authorization. Indeed, the reaction of the Turin authorities, indicates that they were well aware of his source. Life would be simpler if the individual who was intermediary for this sample would come forward. Alas, life and the Shroud, are not simple.\nTime eventually runs out for us all.\n\n","date":"March 31, 2013 at 6:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/res-ipsa-loquitur-the-facts-speak-for-themselves/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Res ipsa loquitur:  The facts speak for themselves."},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Giorgio,\nThe man has refused entreaties from at least one internationally known personality.

It’s simply this: greed.\nA had a conversation with someone well versed in the Shrouod from way back. I spoke with him about trying to get the three labs to open up on their samples to see if they have a relationship to Ray Rogers findings. He said it would never happen because ASM carbon testing is now a billion dollar industry and the labs could never admit hey were wrong becasue the financial reprucussions would be horrendous. I immediately thought of Henrietta Lacks. \nHere’s why.\nHenrietta Lacks was a poor black woman from Baltimore who died of cancer several decades ago. The Hospital preserved some of her stem cells and they were replicated and became the source of a billions of dollars industry. Her stem cells have built sky scrappers.\nWhat did the estate of Henrietta Lacks get out of this: na da, nothing. \nThe C-14 testing of the Shroud was an entirely different procedure and industry. Howver, we are being naive (as I was) in thinking the labs would ever take any steps to jeopardize the validity of their most famous case – the Shroud of Turin. There is too much money at stake. \nI am reminded in the story in the Gospel where Christ cured a women of possession but that the demons then went out an possessed a heard of swine which became enraged and stampeded over a cliff. The  pig herders then drove Christ away. Salvation could wait, the money mattered more.\nI think that enormous progress has been made but the C-14 tests have not yet made it to the dust bin of history. You can not serve God and Mamon. The scientists who stand-by the C-14 testing knowing it was flawed, have made a choice.

Those who who keep demanding that the Church yield the Shroud for investigation to sectarian authority, overlook the fact that the carbon labs have by and large been jealously guarding the remaining pieces of the samples in their position.

Barrie’s photos are interesting and the cooperation initially shown by Jull promising. Now it appears to be withdrawn.\n Perhaps the academics and critics who direct so much fire at  the Church and Turin should direct some of it at Arizona and Zurich (Oxford calims to have no samples remaining). Given the work of Rogers and now Fanti, their silence speaks volumes. \nThe only right to silence in the US is for people accused of a crime. In the absent of that, the rule is a refusal to testify allows the furthest inference possible to be drawn from the evidence of the adversary. Even in complex federal litigation over patents there are procedures for revealing to the court and litigants all manner of claimed “trade secrets” when needed and relevant.\nMuch of the procedure and findings of the labs has been shielded from review by critics. I am not in the position to marshal that criticism today. Perhaps someone else may have the complaints about the labs failing to fully disclose what happened at their finger tips. When I have a chance, I’ll dig it out but for now this controversy becomes a part of Chapter 10: The carbon  dating fiasco.  I am working on Chapter 12 now and have about four more to go.\nThe evidence of the adversary that Shroud is the burial cloth a man crucified circa 30 CE hasn’t been hidden.

You kneel and genuflect at the altar of science and like the popes (in the past) and too many clerics ignore the sins of some priests. \nYou have stated that the sampling procedure was defective. There is no question that the carbon sample site was the worst possible choice. The labs were hungry for the publicity and the money (including government grants) they would flow from the tests. Oxford found, and then ignored evidence of cotton INTERWINED with the linen threads in their sample. The cotton was not enough to skew the sample by itself but it was unique to the area and INTERWINED cotton dd not exist on the Shroud in chief. Ther  STURP team, which was aware of Raes comment that his sample had cotton looked for it in 1978 and couldn’t find it. Rogers reported on that fact. They did find ambiemt, promiscuous pieces of cotton deposited through the years but NO intertwined cotton.The pictures of he STURP team taken demonstrate the scrutiny the team did in Turin relatively high powered microscopes.

One piece of that was that the labs would NOT confer on their results prior to announcement of the results. Instead they did confer and it appears they have adjusted them. Michael Tite who was the the supposed guardian of the process was a candidate to become director of the one of the labs even before the testing  (Oxford) was dismissive of the protocols.\nYour priestly scientists should be excommunicated, or at least have their work discarded – which by reason of their silence, among other things,  –  it has been.\n\n","date":"November 10, 2013 at 7:30 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/10/the-mysterious-arizona-piece/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Mysterious Arizona Piece"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Colin,\nWe have an agreement in general on the need for new tests. \nThe problem is setting proper protocol  for tests and reconciling the need for new tests with the issue of preservation. Also, what is the regime for the tests. There have been various reports of new non-invasive procedures. We (at least I) need to be educated on these procedures. How good are they? Fanti claims to have dated the Shroud through application of a different procedure. His report of that as to the Shroud was formally peer reviewed and the provenance of is sample threads challenged. However  it appears that a general report on the method was published in a peer reviewed journal without reference to the Shroud. \nNot that peer review is a guarantee of everything. Benford and Marino sought to publish their critique in Radio Carbon and the peer reviewed committee included people connected to the labs they were criticizing. Ideas that challenge the norm are often rejected out of hand. \nI will begin my section on Christ and the Quantum (I think) with the story of Hans Berger. Totally ridiculed he died an unhappy man. It’s ideas were weird and way out here. Rejected for decades by the scientific establishment. And by the way, he invented and developed one  of the primary diagnostic tools of the twentieth century. Tease alert, if you want to know, look him up.\nThere is also another issue: It’s been 25 years since the carbon dating. Surely the technology has advanced since then. I really hope that both the Turin and Ohio conferences will advance and educate on these issues. Maybe I will not be around by the time fruition comes. It might take years. Less than five I might just make it. Maybe if it takes ten, I’ll still be around. Twenty, in my nineties, who knows?\nBut the relative urgency of my desire to know more, can’t short circuit the development of an new protocol for new testing. Carbon dating is only one method of examination. We can now study reactions down to the quantum level. Actually that’s what florescence is and the MRI.Science will hopefully get better not worse.\nI will make one statement you will probably disagree with. New carbon dating, unlike the 1988 dating MUST be in the context of a panoply of examination processes. That was another error of the 1988 testing, perhaps the basic error, the exclusion of other tests.\nI have taken the time to answer you because I wanted to point hat I am not so far apart form you and Charles Freeman on the the need for new tests.\nIf we are lucky, except for the Shroud, may we all die with our curiosity unabated.\nNow I really have  to work.

Vignon’s 1902 book had been translated into English from French  circa 1902, but Beecher’s was written in English circa 1930. He sallied forth to do battle with English Jesuit Herbert Thurston and Beecher was a lively presence to the branch of his family who were in the US  (as was his antipathy to Thurston).\nWe are in the study and debate about the Shroud dealing with cosmic issues. By some “accident” of history, Barrie has become the leading of voice for the authenticity of the Shroud. The packed presentation at St. John’s attests to that.

I believe that Richard Dawkins may have coined the phrase “argument from incredulity” to describe fundamentalists who reject evolution because they can’t believe it. He certainly used it.\nBlood was discovered on the Shroud. One of the processes used was multi-spectral analysis. Initially it was identified as primate blood but further investigation it was determined to be human. As important to its identification as blood were invisible serum halos around the major stains, particularly the spear wound were detected. It would not have been possible or conceivable for a forger to do this without the use of real human blood. Heller asked medieval art experts whether they were aware of any artists who used blood and the universal answer was no. Perhaps Charles could enlighten us as to any medieval artist who used human blood and where we might find EXISTING examples that have survived from Medieval times. The blood on the Shroud exists today. \nMcCrone came up with serial explanations for the “painting” of the blood all of which were conclusively rebutted buy the scientific analysis.

One of the places where it becomes relevant is in the issue of what are commonly referred to as paranormal phenomena. The scientists who study these phenomena are often derided by the main stream but the pehenomena are real. \nOne example. During the Vietnam war,  woman awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of a rifle shot. It was inexplicable in he normal course of events where she lived. She later learned that her husband had been killed in Vietnam and when she received details discovered that it happened by a rifle shot at the precise time she had been awakened in the night.\nI have a coleaugue who had been married but divorced. His ex-wife moved to Florida. They had a dog who had passed away. \nOne night he had dream about the dog had died. He came to him in the dream barking as if he should wake-up and do something. His sense was that it involved his exwife. It was totally inexplicable. He called his ex-wife the next day and asked if she was okay. She told him she was getting married that day. That marriage didn’t turn out well.. \nThen there is the  case of Hans Berger Berger which I discuss in Chapter 15 of Quantum Christ:  Consciousness, Evolution and the Genesis of Good and Evil\n—————————————————————————————————————\nWho is right about human consciousness: the neo-Newtonians or those who find consciousness to be a quantum phenomenon? Perhaps we should begin with the “incredible,” and ultimately tragic, saga of Hans Berger.\n C.Hans Berger and his magic machine\nHans Berger was born May 21, 1873 in Neuses, a small Bavarian town that was eventually absorbed by the City of Coburg. He was the son of a well to do physician.  His father’s wealth freed Berger from the day to day struggle of the less fortunate to just survive. He had interests, but no extraordinary ambition. Hans was not interested in pursuing a career in medicine and settled, initially, on a career in Astronomy.\nHe enrolled as a mathematics student at the Fredrich Schiller University of Jena to prepare him for that career, but the pace of life in the city held no allure. He left college and began a year of military training to sort things out. It was while in the cavalry, that an incident occurred, that not only changed the course of his life, but the course of what we call neuroscience, the study of the nervous system, including the brain.\nOne morning, he was thrown from his horse during a training exercise. He landed on the road in the path of a fast approaching team of horses pulling a heavy gun carriage. His thought was quite explicit: “I’m going to die.” Fortunately, the drivers of the gun carriage were able to rein-in their team of horses and it stopped short of Berger. Shaken, but not injured, he returned to his exercise and his duties.\nThat evening, when he returned to his quarters, he found a telegram from his father inquiring about his welfare. That morning, his sister had become quite hysterical because she felt that Hans had been in an accident and died. His father inquired anxiously if he was all right. Berger promptly responded but he was amazed that his sister had an attack of hysteria at the moment of his grave peril when he consciously thought he was about to die.\nIt was a life changing moment for Hans Berger. His attention turned to neuroscience. He concluded that the brain must in some way think and process electromagnetic waves and that in some way his thought of his impending death had been transmitted to his sister with whom he had a close relationship. Needless to say, as he advanced in his study of neuroscience, contemporary colleagues were quite dubious and treated his ideas with derision. Undeterred, he developed a machine to measure “brain waves.” More derision, but in 1924, his machine began to achieve acceptance. It was dubbed the Electroencephalograph, the EEG, which was a breakthrough in the analysis and treatment of brain disorders.\nBerger’s life continued on a troubled plane. He never received what he regarded as his proper recognition. The next two decades would see the rise of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi party. There is some controversy about whether Berger was a Nazi collaborator. In any event, he retired from the University of Jena in 1939. In 1940, plagued by ill health and his failure to achieve what he regarded as his proper place in the scientific pantheon, he committed suicide. Today, there are research organizations in neuroscience that have either adopted his name or sponsor conferences in his name.\nThe EEG, which was a scientific breakthrough of the first order, has been in some respects replaced by the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which allows analysis not only of the brain but the entire body or selected parts of it. Professors Bruce Rosenbaum and Fred Kuttner, of the University of California Santa Cruz, writing in The Quantum Enigma: Physics encounters Consciousness, claim that “One third of our economy” involves products based upon quantum mechanics and go on to describe four of them: the laser; CCDs (charge coupled devices that, among other things record images in digital cameras); the transistor; and the MRI. \nThe scope of these four devices that use quantum mechanical methods indicates the distinction between the reflective consciousness of humanity and the consciousness of all other life on earth. Mastering quantum mechanics is one of the greatest accomplishments of humanity’s reflective consciousness. Most importantly, that reflective consciousness is the reason we, as distinguished from all other forms of life on earth, are constrained in our actions by ethics and morality. All other living creatures answer to unfettered instinct. The natural world is a violent, nasty place.  \nIs humanity different? If so, why?\n—————————————————————————————–\nThere will be those who find precursor attributes in the animal kingdom such as empathy and perhaps even a kind of ethics. Also, animals clearly have access to quantum phenomena. The migration of birds is alleged to guided by access to the quantum. That is a debate that would lead us to far from the issue at hand. Some might argue about my description of Neo-Newtonians as deterministic, This is probably not the place to debate those issues. There are others devoted to philosophy who made resent the intrusion of hard science into philosophical issues.\nI would also direct attention to the hypotheses  of consciousness being advanced by former Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell who once co-authored a piece with – gasp – Sue Benford.\nI do not adopt or advocate any of these necessarily. But there is a direction and of  both science and religion and we are being pulled in that direction. I guess when push comes to shove I am a “Chardinist” (as in Teilhard de Chardin). (I was so labeled in private correspondence by a contributor to this blog who as a degree from the Harvard Divinity School and thought my ideas Chardinian).\n\n","date":"March 16, 2015 at 11:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/16/barrie-schwortz-not-a-painting-photograph-scorch-or-rubbing/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Barrie Schwortz:  Not a Painting, Photograph, Scorch or Rubbing"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Weird but interesting.

I would agree that the time is long past for further non-intrusive scientific examination of the Shroud. The problem is that neither you nor I, nor apparently anybody else, can get Turin to budge. I believe there may be an element in the Church that prefers the Shroud remain a mystery. \nIf the Shroud’s authenticity is established then it becomes no less than a Revelation with a capital R. We will know more about the real Jesus that at any time in history. Also, it will be an accessible revelation. There may be some in the Church who would prefer that not happen. Holy icon, yes. New Revelation, No.\nI am not sure about how Pope Francis would feel if he addressed the problem. He seems somewhat obsessed with serving the poor and downcast. I don’t know where he got that from. (I’m kidding, of course I know where as does any other Christian). In some circles, I am regarded as a liberal or worse. I like to say that I am slightly to the right of JC.\nThe only person on this blog who is directly involved in organizing the St. Louis conference is Joe Marino. I expect he is reading this thread.\nActually, I am some what excited by what  people are writing. I think we owe a debt to Charles Freeman for kicking this off. Maybe a theme for the conference should be “What next?” \nExcuse me for mentioning STURP again, but it gained unprecedented access to the Shroud. It was a unique confluence of energy that caused that to happen. First and foremost, perhaps, was Father Peter Rinaldi who was an Turin born priest serving in the United States who in a figurative sense was the one who brought the shroud to America. Then there were was Silent Witness, the David Rolfe film based upon an concept by Ian Wilson. Then there was Ian’s first book. And, although it rubs my populist grain the wrong way, there was the exiled King of Italy, Umberto. And  there was of course, John Jackson, who caught fire (almost literally) and with the help of Eric Jumper organized STURP. When you appreciate this confluence, you might add another factor and please don’t groan: the Holy Spirit. It’s enough to make one believe in the Trinity.\nIt was and is a fantastic story. The challenge is to repeat it. Maybe the first stop is St. Louis although it must be a truly international effort.

I do not believe that your concept of a single lab no matter how well qualified taking possession of the Shroud for testing would fly. Although the sample selection for the carbon testing was flawed, the fact is that the three labs were supposed to test there samples and not consult about their results. \nThat simplest part of the protocol was not honored, but the concept  having three independent tests as a check on  each other was a valid one.\n A single commercial investigator isn’t likely, particularly when the advocate of that approach  can’t fit the conferences into his schedule. We all have choices to make. This summer, I put aside most of the time I intended to spend on Shroud because I had an eight year defamation case to try. My obligation to my client had to come first. (Incidentally, we won).\nTo study the issues raised by the Shroud is a time consuming process. Maybe a book at the end of the trail may pay some compensation but that can be a long shot gamble. Very long.\nBut I believe the mystery of the Shroud is worth the extraordinary time and effort it takes. I am reminded of the parable of the wealthy young man who approached Christ and said that he had been faithful to the commandments all his life. What more should he do to obtain salvation?

[Quoted from memory.]  \nI believe that the scientific study of the Shroud has been a revelation and the challenge of the Shroud compels something more than tea-kettle experiments. The dialogue on this blog can be pretty contentious but I have to credit Colin Berry bringing something to my attention that I had over-looked. That forensic pathologist  Zugibe concluded among very many other things that the image showed sign that Christ may have  suffered from Marfen’s syndrome. \nActually, that was in an earlier work by Zugibe published in 1981 and his last work that I had did not discuss Marfan but cited two books that did in the bibliography. However, I now think it may be worth a deeper analysis. As noted by some, it might explain the fact that Christ’s relative quick expiration on the cross surprised Pilate. [The husband of my wife’s cousin died unexpectedly and it was suspected that he may have suffered from Marfan’s.] There is a comment in Martin Kemp’s “Christ to Coke” book on icons that comes to mind.\nI have to travel out the Mineola courthouse today, and I am, of course way behind on my manuscript, but I felt this digression is necessary.\nI wish you well, but a single commercial provider taking possession of the Shroud for tests isn’t going to happen.

The Shroud is unlike any other relic because if it is authentic it is both an artifact of Christ himself and a possible witness to the Resurrection. Unlike many people of a religious bent, I do not believe there is a distinct line between faith and religion. I take my guidance from Teillhard in that regard who wrote that there is an inevitable conjunction of the two. Science has explained so much of what was once considered the province  religion. It has now come to the edge of some intrinsically, cosmic, religious questions. I believe that science attempting to define human  consciousness is  science defining the soul.

Those who believe that the “gift” of faith is what matters can sniff at them and they, like the Pharisee” in the parable, thank God they are not like others. \nI believe the Shroud is more than an relic or artifact, it is a revelation for our time that as been waiting two millennia for science to reveal its mysteries.

In our times, science may in fact be delivering the gift of faith to a faithless age. \nIt is my opinion, it is not sufficient to sit back and tut tut all the faithless when there is at hand a miracle, but a miracle that is being revealed by science. \nThat’s appropriate, because at the very beginning of human history, there was no dividing line between religion and science. The first scientists were the priests. Witness for example the complex, but brutal civilization of Maya’s which practiced human sacrifice. We may abhor their practices, but the same priests who offered-up the sacrifices where the “scientists” who studied the stars and made incredible discoveries and predictions. Some the greatest “scientists” of medieval and Renaissance times were in fact priests and ministers.\nOn my manuscript, I will give Teilhard a go. He was a Jesuit priest who was and anthropologist who foretold a convergence of science and religion. Do I think the Shroud is authentic? Yes. My belief and the Shroud are what we call a positive feed back. The Gospels, much maligned by Dawkins et al demonstrate the authenticity of the Shroud and the Shroud demonstrates the authenticity of the Gospels.\nThe mystery of faith in Catholic Church until the recent, scatter-brained change of it was : Christ has died, Christ has risen; Christ will come again. The Shroud authenticates the first two items, and be in at least a metaphorical or allegorical sense, the fullfilment of the final item.

For the past two years we have been celebrating day by day the 150th anniversary of events in the Civil War. This year is of course huge. There is the horrific Union loss at Chancellorsville followed by the turning point victories at Vicksburg and Gettysburg in July, followed by the Gettysburg address at which redefined our  Nation, turning us toward the fundamental values of the Declaration of Independence.\nThis is also the fiftieth anniversary of two events of the JFK presidency. The first was the June speech at American University in DC where he first publicly proposed a ban on the atmospheric testing of Atomic weapons. Both he and Khrushchev and looked into the abyss the previous year during he Cuban Missile Crisis and knew the desperate path the World was trodding toward nuclear anihilation.\nKennedy’s speech is best remembered by this phrase about the need for Us-Soviet cooperation:\nFor in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.\nKennedy lost the White House on November 22, 1963. There is substantial evidence that he did plan to pull of Viet Nam after the 1964 election and already had drafted an order to pull back our commitment. All that ended in Dallas, His successor gave the military-industrial complex the war it wanted.\nLincoln finally won is war in 1865. He visited vanquished Richmond but a week later he too was assassinated.\nI have come to believe the enduring truth of the Christian faith (or myth, if that suits you) is not the resurrection but its transfiguring of all human experience into the divine. Lincoln and Kennedy both enjoyed great triumphs before their assassins struck. The cheers in Dallas were still ringing in JFK’s ears when all went black.\nToday is Palm Sunday when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the back of an ass. Cheers were ringing also n his ears. Then came the crucifixion and three days of black for his disciples. And then cam Easter morning and the witness of Mary Magdalene that some thing had marvelous had happened.\nToday is Palm Sunday and we can not forget even as we celebrate that Good Friday lies only five days in the future. But then two days more and it is Easter.\nI close with a quotation from Elaine Pagels, autyher of the Gnostic Gospels:\n“In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.”\nWe in this generation are blessed with a new revelation: His Shroud which not only registers the fact of His crucifixion, but whispers the hope of His Resurrection (and ours),\n\n","date":"March 24, 2013 at 12:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/24/palm-sunday-jesus-triumphal-entry-into-jerusalem/","cat":"event","title":"Palm Sunday: Jesus’ Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Notice where and how the cleric in upper left-hand corner of the photograph is gripping the Shroud.\n\n","date":"May 10, 2015 at 6:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/10/picture-for-today-getting-ready-for-the-shroud-exhibition-in-1931/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Picture for Today:  Getting Ready for the Shroud Exhibition in 1931"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"OOPS right-hand as viewed.\n\n","date":"May 10, 2015 at 6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/10/picture-for-today-getting-ready-for-the-shroud-exhibition-in-1931/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Picture for Today:  Getting Ready for the Shroud Exhibition in 1931"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Lord save You (and me) from your friends.\nOne of the peersistent aspects of the Shroud controversy since the time of Pia has been over-reaching which is totally unnecessary.

Wells of the University of London in a number of books, including Did Jesus Exist?\n“Although Jesus probably” existed, reputable biblical scholars do not in general regard the New Testament (and obviously not the Old Testament) as a reliable record of what actually happened in history, and I shall not consider the Bible further as evidence for any kind of deity.”  \nNotice that there is no logical flow to this at all, only the slick spiel of a used car salesman.\nHis use of “probably” to modify existed means that there is doubt and he then jumps to a complete rejection of  the Bible as any kind of deity.

His rivals claimed that there were 613 commandments of God, each one of which had to be obeyed to the letter, all were equally important.\nChrist was challenged by one of those who sought to trap Him by asking him “Which was the greatest commandment?” He replied (in words from the Torah) “to love God with your whole heart, mind and soul.” and then continued: “And the second is like unto this: To love your neighbor as yourself. Upon these two is are based all the law and the prophets.” In the parable of the Last Judgment (parable is Pope Benedict’s word) Christ tells us that the only measure is what we do for the least of God’s brethern.” It’s the one commandment of love.\nThat’s a pretty big agenda right there. I believe that Science is not only proving the authenticity of the Shroud, but through quantum mechanics we are seeing the reality of love. I am sure that  to some that may appear to be out there. But to me it’s in here. We are on the verge of a new Revelation through Science. \nFor those who have no interest of such, God Bless.\n\n","date":"April 1, 2012 at 5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Joe Marino’s book “Wrapped in the Shroud” referenced by Jumper is not about the maillard reaction.

What a terrible burden it is for Dawkins to be the foremost atheist among the eight billion.\nThat being said, when it comes to the slaughter of innocents in Canaan, I tend to agree with Dawkins that this was inexcusable barbarity. I remember watching a History Channel program on ancient generals two  or three years ago which recorded Joshua’s slaughter of women and children in Jericho after “the walls came tumbling down.” I was appalled. When I discovered that Joshua was acting on a divine command, I decided that I could not worship such a God. I was deeply saddened when a Jewish friend of mine gave the human reasoning behind that. Leaving the women and children alive would have resulted in the leaving the seeds of idolatry to blossom and grow. That came to mind a year or so later, when on another History (or Military Channel rebroadcast) I heard a Himmler speech to the German Generals as the WWII ground to its close and the Third Reich was collapsing. “We had to kill the children,” he said, “because they would grow-up to seek revenge upom us killing their parents.”\nMuch of  Bible is rationalization for human endeavors. Of course, that argues against it not being history. Some of its history is sad. \nBut I highly recommend the direction of religions which is the basis of Richard Wright’s “The Evolution of God.” Jesus challenged the Pharisees” “What do you think of the Messiah [Christ}, whose son is he?” Wright is somewhat dismissive of the universality of Jesus message adopting the “Paul did it view.” But I think the last paragraph of his book sums up not only the direction of religious thought, but of Christianity itself:\n“Though we can no more conceive of God than we can conceive of an electron, believers can ascribe properties to God, somewhat as physicists ascribe properties to electrons. One of the more plausible such properties is love. And maybe, in this light, the argument for God is strengthened by love’s organic association with truth—by the fact, indeed, that at times these two properties almost blend into one. You might say that love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake, and that by partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine. Then again, you might not say that. The point is just you wouldn’t have to be crazy to say it.” *\nAmen, Mr. Wright, amen.\n*(Wright, Robert (2009-05-20). The Evolution of God .

The question is: how much should this bother us? While it would be a lot easier if we had warehouse receipts and shipping labels, we are never going to have in my opinion, a definitive  provenance of the Shroud from the tomb to Constantinople and I doubt we will ever have a definitive provenance from Constantinople to Lirey. It does make for great debates though. Personally, I have a tendency to doubt the details of the Templar theory. The Templar’s have become the “usual suspects” of medieval history.\nWhile we may never know the complete provenance of the Shroud., we  have learned a great deal. Most importantly in my view,  we have  two related physical facts: the blood stains and the image. Science has come a long way in unlocking these mysteries. It is definitely blood, but the nature of the mechanism that transferred the image from the body of tortured, crucified man to the Shroud remains a mystery. \nScience has gone along ways toward resolving the issue of the blood and identifying what the image is not: it was not created by any process we have been able to discern.\nJust as science has given us a definite answer to the blood issue (and it has), science may one day give us a definite solution to the image issue. I suspect that when it does, the answer will be the Resurrection. And unlike some, I like Teilhard, see science as an ally not an enemy of religion. I also believe that somewhere in the chaotic world of quantum mechanics will lie solutions to the many religious mysteries and the answers will not be bad for religion.\nI am reminded of Rabbi Hillel’s formulation of the Golden Rule and then adding: “Everything else is commentary.” As far as the provenance issue is concerned, solving the problem of image formation is paramount. Giving the impossibility of resolving the issues of where the Shroud was when it twice disappeared for literally hundreds of years is commentary.\nI have enormous respect for Ian Wilson and what he has done in his work on the Shroud. I don’t know if this is common knowledge, but it isn’t a secret. David Rolfe’s 1978 landmark “Silent Witness” began with a proposal by Ian Wilson circa 1974. Outside of that,  I personally believe that Ian’s most important contribution, may be in bringing  the Vignon markings to a greater audience. I also believe, as illusive as they may seem, the Vignon markings in art outside  of the  Shroud itself, are the most compelling evidence of the pre-Constantinople provenance of the Shroud with the emergence of the markings as an artistic convention. \nI find this debate interesting, but I honestly believe that the pre-Constantinople provenance of the Shroud has disappeared into the mists of time. But just like the bones of a dinosaur discovered today, the physical existence of the Shroud testify to  its previous existence.\n\n","date":"January 14, 2014 at 8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Thanks for the compliment and I agree in part.

That was two years and  a lot of research ago. The six month time frame I gave my self is now going to be two years + but maybe Ash Wednesday and certainly by Holy Week 2014.\nI introduce this comment with that story, because horrors of horrors, I am now going to say something as a lawyer. The most complex thing of all is fraud. “Oh what tangled webs we weave, when first we practice to deceive.” By the way, I just this instant learned something. I would have though that line was from Bobby Burns, but it was from Sir Walter Scott. (he was Scottish too)\nDuring my career, I instigated  or was  principal instigator of several investigations for fraud. Two of them standout, one was an international financier who stole more than a billion dollars during the course of his career. I once said to his lawyer, that my client would settle its claims for two million dollars. He said “It’s hard to talk two million dollars with you when you are the one who put my client out business.” He hesitated and then continued on with obvious anger , “There is no question about it: Miami, Atlantic City, you are the one who put him out of business.” My response was unspoken: “From you lips to God’s ear.” I say that not to simply blow my horn but to indicate when I say that fraud, and the proof thereof, is a complex thing, I write from some experience.\nIncidentally, a former FBI agent who has been in the international news this week once told me over breakfast in Miami. “It’s pleasure to help you. I know who you are what you have meant to the Bronx.\nIn his memoir of the Shroud, John Heller who was advised by Einstein when he was an undergraduate at Yale introduced me to the “gededenkenexperiment.” (thought experiment). That means to think through a proposition taking into all the knowns and applying science to them. The great ting about the gededenkenexperiment, Einstein told his young student, “it doesn’t require much of a budget.”\nHeller and Adler conducted a gededenkenexperiment on forging the Shroud, they ended up painting with a 12 foot or so paint brush looking through a telescope as they painted with a brush whose hair was a hundredth or so finer than any ever manufactured.\nWhen you say the Resurrection is the most complex of all explanations you are betraying not a scientific fact but an existing bias. Marcello Truzzi who was one of the founders of Center for Skeptical Inquiry quit after a couple of years because he discovered that most of his colleagues were not interested in the dispassionate search for truth but only to validate pre-existing assumptions such as  there is no God and no miracles.\nMy point is simple. If you eliminate the possibility of the Resurrection, you are going to come-up with proposed solutions which are all false and really, more complex than the Resurrection. The Shroud is the artifact of the transformation of Christ’s body into another form. We have yet to ken the process. My belief is that it is a whole lot simpler than forgery or inventing photography four centuries ahead of time or using a crucifix to produce a bas relief. \nThis comment is a little longer than it probably should be. I really appreciate the chance of using the blog as a sounding board before a critical audience. \nBut his morning I arose to wrap the last few presents. We celebrate the birth of Christ whose birth transfigured human nature. But as we contemplate that transformation we must recall, the horrible death that awaited him 33 years in the future. Isabel Pizcek has called the Shroud an “event horizon.” I happen to agree, as I shall explain. Hopefully before Easter.\nMy favorite Christmas carol has a line that I think sums up the joy of the day to me and I think everyone whether they realize or not:\n“Long lay the world, in sin and error pining,\ntill he appeared and the soul felt its worth.”\nMerry Christmas\n\n","date":"December 25, 2013 at 8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/23/did-the-apostles-notice-an-image-on-the-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"Did the Apostles Notice an Image on the Cloth?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Typo alert : “sand is they prefer” should be “sand if they prefer.”\n\n","date":"April 19, 2014 at 11:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/19/happy-easter-from-discovery/","cat":"history","title":"Happy Easter from Discovery"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"There are four accounts that generally concur in describing the crucifixion of Jesus.

To counteract rumors that Nero, himself, was responsible for the fire, he blamed the burgeoning Christian sect in Rome and commenced a pervasive, sadistic persecution of the Christians: \n“’Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.’ \n“John Meier finds that the Tacitus report in Annals is authentic and not a Christian forgery.”\nOstrich-like agnostics and atheists can stick their head in the sand is they prefer.

Among their targets has been the Shroud of Turin and they have written much nonsense about the Shroud and they believe in the discredited carbon dating as much as some believe that Christ didn’t die on the Shroud but traveled to India after the Crucifixion. Kind of a “Cook’s Tour” I guess.\nIn any event, some excerpts from Zugibe’s final book.\n“If a person is in complete rigor mortis, the only way to change the position of a limb at a joint is to break the rigor, a term referring to the forcible bending of a limb at any joint. For example, if an elbow is in rigor mortis and bent to an angle of 45 degrees, straightening the arm is possible by forcibly straightening it. The greater the muscular development, the greater the force required to break the rigor.”\n       *  *  *\n“This fact has medico-legal significance to determine if a body has been moved after rigor mortis set in. For example, if a body was found lying flat with the legs suspended in the air, it would be immediately obvious that the body was moved from a position where the legs were resting on something.”\nFrederick T.

I have been working on this controversy over the shroud for more than two years.  I know there are a lot of people who’ve spent much more time on this and I have.  What I don’t have time are  issues that are clearly leading up blind alleys and may in fact be planted as deliberate distractions.\nI believe that Jacques  De Molay and Leonardo da Vinci when it comes to the shroud are distractions.  It is time for them when it comes to the shroud to be assigned to the dustbin of history.  I also have a feeling that the propagators of these theories may be distracting us on purpose.\nDe Molay and Leonardo and become “usual suspects of mystery.” That’s a paraphrase of one of the widely quoted lines from the movie Casablanca.  Inspector Renault (Claud Rains) having just witnessed Rick (Humphrey Bogart) shoot SS Major Strasser, says to a car full of his policemen that pulls-up: “Major Strasser has been shot, round-up the usual suspects.” It today’s parlance, one might say that line has become viral.\nFor someone to gain attention, it’s always great to say the Templars, or Jacques de Molay and Leondardo did it. It’s always good for some attention and some book sales.\nBut it is a distraction. Leonardo did not photograph the Shroud and DeMolay who was roasted on a spit and then burned at the stake is not the man in the Shroud.\nMy concern is that the proponents of these theories have their own agenda besides just making a few bucks or pound sterling. They want to distract us from the fundamental   truth that Jesus Christ existed and that he suffered a horrible death. His crime was to preach love and, to many, his Resurrection gives courage to persevere in love no matter what the cost. \nNow I have to get back to the real story.\n\n","date":"February 7, 2014 at 6:22 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Annette, \nI have this vague feeling that you are native French speaker.

Against the weight of authority cited by Dan Porter and the very informative posts in this thread from individuals trained in medicine and one with hands on EMT experienced dealing with trauma victims, you can only cite “I read a book” and the books you cite have nothing to do with the crucifixion of the Man in the Shroud as far as I can tell.\nThere are exciting things happening in the world of the Shroud in the next two years and we may be able to influence them.

Charles Freeman is one person with a definition. His limited definition is how the term  first came into parlance. However, on this side of the Atlantic we have a great deal of back and forth about the nature of skepticism and one the prime philosophers of skepticism is Marcelo Truzzi. You can read an essay of his on skepticism at http://www.anomalist.com/commentaries/pseudo.html\nTruzzi is deceased so i assume everybody so minded can pile on him in safety. However, there is one statement that appears to have originated with him that is communally attributed to Carl Sagan who uttered it on TV some years after Trunzi first wrote it: “Exceptional claims demand exceptional evidence.” Someone told me that the statement sprang f=rom the work of the English philosopher Hume although I have not investigated it further than the Truzzi quote.\nI think when it comes to the Shroud the issue is, given the evidence, what is the exceptional claim? Authenticity or in-authenticity. Once you understand the facts that defeat the carbon dating, you might very well argue, that based on all the facts, the exceptional claim is in-authenticity.\nBy the way, I have found some Charles Freeman posts to be enlightening even when I  disagree with him. But when it comes to his rather limited definition of pseudo-skeptic, at least on his side of the Atlantic he is wrong.\n\n","date":"February 9, 2014 at 9:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/02/07/how-certain-are-we-that-the-man-on-the-shroud-is-in-rigor-mortis/","cat":"history","title":"How certain are we that the man on the shroud is in rigor mortis?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Hugh,\nI believe that the claim that Shroud is of medieval original is not only exceptional but false.

The Shroud is a revelation that will ultimately be beyond the control of any particular faction of the Church or society.

See http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/fatima2011.pdf\nFor documentation of the fact that the Oxford sample was from an apparently anomalous portion of the Shroud see: http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Thomas_Ferguson_files/Updated_report_on_the_Consideration_to_the_Uniformity_and_Effects_of_the_Fabric_in_the_Shroud_of_Turin-5-1.pdf\nhttp://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud_of_Turin_exhibition/Three_threads_files/BL%20Sebastian%20for%20website%201.pdf\nIn sum, the 1978 Quad Mosaics were in fact the result of an examination of the spectra of the Shroud using three filters B/G/R. There is evidence that samples of the Shroud cut primarily from the frayed corners were gifted by the Savoy’s to those royal houses and individuals it favored. \nI would think that you would agree that a carefully conducted, non-intrusive multi-spectral digital image examination of the Shroud conducted to standards such as those used by Lumiere would be of enormous value, not just to scientists, but to history.\n\n","date":"August 2, 2015 at 8:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/01/remembering-an-earlier-posting-about-the-seamless-robe/","cat":"history","title":"Remembering an Earlier Posting About The Seamless Robe"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Who is this guy/gal?

I think the bias against science as a grounds for faith expressed by some represents a misunderstanding of where science is heading. Scientific and philosophical determinism dominated science until the beginning of he 20th century when the incongruities of quantum mechanics revealed destroyed the basic assumptions of determinism and revealed realty to be conscious driven and devoid of “common sense.” \nThe Determinists included Newton, Darwin, Freud, Marx and Adam Smith. The end result was that free will was discarded as a myth and we acted in accordance with a myriad of circumstances that determined our action. The seeds of quantum mechanics were planted around the turn of the twentieth century, at the same time that science through Pia’s photography demonstrated the image on the Shroud to be the image of a tortured and crucified man who could only be Jesus Christ.\nThe complaint about the Shroud is that it lacks “provenance” – a demonstrated history. But the physical facts of the Shroud demonstrate through scientific examination establish its authenticity.\nWhen one places the collapse of determinism that is intrinsic in quantum mechanics along the side the development of Shroud Science, the question arises is not provenance, but providence.\n(Some determined atheists may argue that quantum mechanics does not refute determinism, but their arguments smack more of desperation than logic.)\n\n","date":"April 17, 2012 at 10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/17/the-shroud-as-reasons-to-believe-in-the-resurrection/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud as Reasons to Believe in the Resurrection"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"blnd = blind.

In his introduction Freeman states that “I decided to leave out the Shroud of Turin. Relic cults come and go and the Turin Shroud is very much a cult of the past fifty years, not a medieval one.”\nThat is an incredible statement. Let’s assume that we are all wrong, let’s assume that the Shroud is a hoax (It isn’t, but lets’s assume that, as they say,  arguendo.) How then to explain the badge at the Clony Museum in Paris or the paintings of the Shroud and its exposition to thousands prior to the Pia photograph of 1898. (More than 50 years ago assuming my math is accurate.) Medieval artist did indeed copy it and certain artistic conventions that appear on the Justinian coins, for example indicate they came from the Shroud image. (Check the “V” forelock)\nThe contention that Freeman ignored the Shroud because it wasn’t a medieval cult is pure baloney. He ignored because he can’t deal with it as a object of scientific inquiry.\nThe Shroud is a real object existing in this time and this place. It has been subjected to  more than a quarter million hours of scientific investigation. Art historians like Freeman are on the wrong track because whatever the Shroud is, it is not a painting and it is not art. The answers lie in science. But it is a challenge as the errant carbon dating shows. Even science can lie. But the discussion must be of science.\nI have enormous respect for Ian Wilson and the contributions he has made.

But your fixation on de Molay and your disdain for Rogers (his pique) leads me to ask it:\nWere you ever a member of the Order of de Molay? or any other organization dedicated to his memory.\nThere are skeptics of the Shroud who unfairly, and inaccurately , depicted STURP as a band of fanatic Christian soldiers. There were many Christians on the STURP team. There were also Jews, agnostics and perhaps some atheists. Thus that attribution was wrong. However, were the member of STURP all been Christian fanatics, or Opus Deii  members, that would be a legitimate question of whether their Christian fanaticism colored their science.\nI will confess, I am a Roman Catholic although I’m not so sure of the Roman part sometimes. I guess I am like Pope Francis: A Vatican Council Catholic, The Pope has described himself  a Vatican Council priest. It is a fair question when challenging me that I am Catholic. It also a fair question to ask a skeptic challenging the Shroud whether he is an atheist. Neither atheism nor Catholicism should disqualify any one from studying and discussing the Shroud and its science.

Were I be asked if I were a member of Opus Dei, I would also deny it. Not because membership in any of the three organizations is a disqualification but membership in any one of the three might define my sense of the Catholic Church. I am not been a member of any of the three, by the way.\nHonestly, Colin, there is only one other person who I ever had a discussion with on de Molay that I can recall. It was in college and I spotted a pin on one of colleagues lapel. I asked him what it was for and he said the Order of de Molay. I asked who he was and he explained it was a Masonic youth order and de Molay was a martyr to free speech.  I put that into my mental file and forget folder along with the Rosicrucians who advertised in the back pages of magazines such as Popular Science. \nThe alleged assassin of Robert Kennedy was identified as having dabbled with a Rosicrucian society and that led me on a trail that wound-up with Holy Blood, Holy Grail (HBHG). It was an interesting read but as I do with most conspiracy books I ignored the principle premise of the book (an obscure Frenchman was a blood descendant of Jesus Christ and was seeking to institute a new really European Empire) and concentrate on the verifiable facts reported. It was an interesting read on the history and I was fascinated by the fact that Madame Calve, the prima diva her time was supposed to be a member of the Pre de Sion, the uber-conspiracy that ruled the world. Madame Calve in the nibneteen twenties had invited my Aunt Pauline, a very great soprano to come to Paris and be her protégé. She didn’t and her story can be found at http://www.johnklotz.com/billy.htm along with some  other family history.\nThe grain of salt I took about the Priory of Sion  was big enough to choke a horse. Dan Brown used the allegations of HBHG  as the inspiration of his “The daVinci Code”  and believe it or not, one of the writers of HBHG was also one of the writers of “The Silent Witness.” That doesn’t make HBHG true or Silent Witness false. Each work must stand on its own.\nBottom line, I am a little more knowledgeable about Jacques de Molay than I was 55 years ago. I guess CB, you are afraid to give an honest answer to the question. \nIf you weren’t so defensive, maybe we could get a new insight. \n“There might be giants” and there might be conspiracies.

One of the things as a youngster I found confusing is how we label a century a year after its calendar dates. The “eighteenth century” is circa 1700-1799. The twentieth century was 1900 to 1999 and the 21st century is our current epoch.\nI make this aside because the date of the decorative panels of the chest means that the whole chest can be traced to 1300-1399, encompassing the precise period of the first public exposition of the Shroud in 1355 and its “vagabond travels” in the 14th-15th centuries including a stop at the de la Roche castle.\nIn Quantum Christ on page 37 I have the following footnote:\n“5 The best evidence is that the Shroud was a part of the booty that was seized by French knights who participated in the sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the abortive Fourth Crusade. Ian Wilson has postulated that it became the property of the Knights Templar. Others postulate that it became the property of Othon de la Roche, a French knight who became Duke of Athens as a reward for outstanding services during the Constantinople sack. De La Roche was the great grandfather of Jeanne de Vergy, Geoffrey’s wife. See the note by Cesar Barta,” Orthon de la Roche” BSTS News Letter, October 5, 2008 (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n67part6.pdf). If true, when Geoffrey I’s (and Jeanne de Vergy’s) daughter married Ortho de la Roche’s great grandson (reinforcing the blood-line ownership of the Shroud) and then moved the Shroud to the de la Roche castle, the Shroud was returned to a previous home.”\n[These facts were brought to my attention by Annette Cloutier]\nIt definitely appears that the Shroud was in the De la Roche castle and it is no surprise that they would have made a suitable chest for its storage. Because of the fact that the Shroud was in constant motion during this period of time it makes sense that the original chest which brought the Shroud from Constantinople to France would have become a bit shop worn and needed replacement. But the bottom was preserved.\nIs this proof of anything? Not conclusive perhaps, but the claims of the De La Roche heirs as represented in the pedigree of the Chest are consistent with known facts.\n\n","date":"November 8, 2015 at 6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/what-am-i-missing/","cat":"history","title":"What am I missing?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Our knowledge of the Shroud’s vagabond ways before it became the property of the House of Savoy comes from the meticulous research of Ian Wilson.\nI cited him for the the following:\n“The Vagabond Shroud\n“After the death of Geoffrey II, on May 22, 1398, the ownership of the Shroud passed to his daughter Margaret.

Colin by creating a scorch from a three dimension object has shown that it will have similar properties to the Shroud. As they say in Yiddish: Neu? [So?] I am not Jewish but 45 years in the Bronx will gives you an appreciation of Yiddish.\nHis example is interesting but it represents the difference in distance as difference in color. The Shroud, like his scorch is monochromatic – a single color. The three dimensional representation that appears in the VP-8 is not caused by a difference in color but a difference in intensity or density of the image. Color (place on the spectrum of light) is different from intensity.\nActually, Colin is about where Ray Rogers was. Rogers  maillard reaction is a kind of scorch at low temperature but he realized that it wasn’t enough. There is that troublesome presence of real unscorched blood on the Shroud. \nLife is simple if you can accept the carbon dating tests. But, I submit, particularly after the Pam Moon presentation at St. Louis of the paper on the Oxford sample, that you can’t.\nMerely calling people like Wesselow or Heller or Adler names, doesn’t due the trick. De Wesselow was trained at the Courtlandt Institute. John Heller had amazing credentials including be chosen by Yale to be advised by Einstein at Princeton when he he was an undergraduate at Yale. Adler was Jewish. Yet, how often are the STURP scientists denigrated as Christian fanatics. \nThe differences in intensity (density) of the image was noted by Vignon were the reason for his “action at a distance” theory. \nSorry Dan, but once you understand that the image of the Shroud is monochromatic, you are back to action at a distance caused by a variation of image intensity, not color. Brightness is a function of intensity or density of the image. So too is “darkness.”\nIndeed, my scientific adviser referred to the VP-8 as a darkness map.

But its on the sole of a foot, his knee and nose and that is compatible with the story of his falling while carrying the cross. What are the odds that a medieval forger would use aragonite dust on his masterpiece of fraud that just happened to match the aragonite in Jerusalem. The point of circumstantial evidence is that no single item may determine the issue but an accumulation of circumstances can lead to a virtually unerring conclusion.  \nI give you quotations I use from Richard Dawkins, the “Atheist Pope” in my manuscript:\nAs a result, Dawkins finds more reliable are inferences drawn from facts; in contrast to the dictionary, he places little weight in eyewitness testimony.\n“The dictionary definition of a fact mentions ‘actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred’ (emphasis added). The implied pejorative of that ‘merely’ is a bit of a cheek. Careful inference can be more reliable than ‘actual observation’, however strongly our intuition protests at admitting it.” Dawkins, Richard (2009-09-18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 15). Free Press. Kindle Edition.\nGiven the fact that in his study of evolution, Dawkins most often deals with ancient artifacts, and there is a paucity of other evidence available other than the artifacts, it makes sense. \n“Obviously, the vast majority of evolutionary change is invisible to direct eye-witness observation. Most of it happened before we were born, and in any case it is usually too slow to be seen during an individual’s lifetime. The same is true of the relentless pulling apart of Africa and South America, which occurs, as we shall see in Chapter 9, too slowly for us to notice. With evolution, as with continental drift, inference after the event is all that is available to us, for the obvious reason that we don’t exist until after the event.” Dawkins, Richard (2009-09-18) (pp. 15-16). Free Press. Kindle Edition.\nThen, Dawkins goes on to make an intriguing analogy:\n“We are like detectives who come on the scene after a crime has been committed. The murderer’s actions have vanished into the past. The detective has no hope of witnessing the actual crime with his own eyes. In any case, the gorilla-suit experiment and others of its kind have taught us to mistrust our own eyes. What the detective does have is traces that remain, and there is a great deal to trust there. There are footprints, fingerprints (and nowadays DNA fingerprints too), bloodstains, letters, diaries. The world is the way the world should be if this and this history, but not that and that history, led up to the present.” Dawkins, Richard (2009-09-18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 16). Free Press.

His wife retyped them on a Woodstock typewriter. There was expert witness that the documents which were retyped on a specific Woodstock typewriter owned by Hiss because of certain anomalies in the type faces.\nAfter Hiss was convicted, during the defense hired a typewriter expert, Martin Tytell to duplicate the typewriter with the same tell tale anomalies. It took two years but he finally did it. Except the evidence was rejected. The fact that the government could have created a fake Woodstock didn’t mean the government did create a fake Woodstock.\nAssume you are right, that someone could have used the method you suggest. That doesn’t mean that someone did use it. And you still have not solved the whole issue of the blood stains.\nYou may believe that the authenticity of the Shroud has not been proven, but to prove it was inauthentic requires something more than proof it might have been faked.\nOf course that’s where the carbon dating comes in. If you accept that, then it’s clear that the Shroud is a fake.

I am not prepared to go much further into this at this time since I am dealing with the C-14 aspects and awaiting a copy of David Sox’s 1981 book. I already have his 1988 book. Sox played an interesting role in the C-14 process and instigated the C-14 labs to push STURP out (not that they needed much encouragement.) \nIn any event, I find Adler’s account interesting. I think I learned something. But when it comes to a “natural” explanation of the image on fall back to Heller: \n“We do know, however, that there are thousands upon thousands of pieces of funerary linen going back two millennia before Christ and another huge number of linens of Coptic Christian burials. On none of these is there any image of any kind. A few have some blood and stains on them, but no image.” Heller, Report on the Shroud of Turin\nI do not believe that any image explanation advanced thus far employing a “natural” process can account for the resolution of the Shroud. Almost all of them would result in diffusion of some kind and that would have prevented the finely detailed image. \nI will be returning to this issue. What I am “playing” with is this concept: If you apply Occam’s razor, you may discover that the simplest explanation is the Resurrection. To simply reject it, is perhaps what Richard Dawkins has dubbed “an Argument from Personal Incredulity:” Just because you can’t believe it doesn’t mean it isn’t so.

We do not order our lives by reasonable doubt, but I believe the doubt as to the Shroud’s authenticity and the Resurrection is arguably unreasonable. Faith not founded on fact  is not faith but superstition. That’s fighting words to some. Similarly, skepticism not founded on fact is not true skepticism but pseudo-skepticism.\nThe atheist and the agnostic reject the possibility of Resurrection, but the Resurrection is, or is not, a fact. The faith that the Resurrection is real is founded on facts as reported in five written accounts and in the sudden transformation of a group of cowering disciples who became inflamed with great courage unto death. And then there is the Shroud of Turin.\nIs the evidence circumstantial: yes. But other than the unprecedented nature of the event what is the proof that it did not happen. The Universe was created when a incredibly tiny “singularity” blossomed into a tiny bit of matter of incredible, virtually immeasurable heat and began the expansion that we are still experiencing to date. Anybody witness that? Where’s the proof? Does any one have the power to repeat it? Yet most educated humans and scientists now accept it as a fact. I certainly do.\nThe Shroud of Turin is a fact. I believe it’s authenticity has been established as a fact and that authenticity is as the burial cloth of a person whose existence is an historical fact. \nThere are some fundamentalist and even some not so fundamentalist who still protest to faith that is not science and therefore believe on faith. If that comforts you, that’s fine. But the time as come to understand that science and religion are no longer running on parallel courses. The issues science is grappling with including, inter alia, the nature of human conscience are religious issues. \nA reporter for Rolling Stone who covered the STURP team in Turin in 1978  wrote that apart from proposed carbon dating, there was as much room for doubt as to the authenticity of the Shroud as there was on a “crowded microdot.” And he rejected Christ’s divinity. That was before the STURP team published its results and before the C14 fiasco. There is no substantial evidence that the Shroud is a forgery and there is no evidence of any kind that it was other than the burial cloth of Jesus,we call Christ.\nThe microdot is even more crowded  today.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2013 at 6:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/12/mystery-as-proof/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Mystery as Proof"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Correction: We do not order our lives by PROOF BEYOND  reasonable doubt.\n\n","date":"December 12, 2013 at 6:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/12/mystery-as-proof/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Mystery as Proof"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles,\nThe second part of my book will explore the issues raised in a piece I blogged sometime ago:\nhttp://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2012/08/michael-redux-quantum-mechanics.html\n\n","date":"December 12, 2013 at 8:11 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/12/mystery-as-proof/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Mystery as Proof"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Michael,\nPope Benedict that well known radical has written about Genesis as allegory and expressed concern about the doctrine of original sin.\nAt least one Catholic academic has called original sin original selfishness which was one of the driving forces of evolution.

Scattered about the scientific landscape like a child’s collection of Legos the elements of science approaching these problems.

That first  published scientific study of the Shroud was Paul Vignon’s 1902 book on the Shroud that was translated into English. I think it is fair to say, that it culminated in STURP’s 120 hours of scientific examination of the Shroud in Turin in 1978.\nThe scientific tests used by the Shroud team and by scientists in  the aftermath (cf Heller and Adler) were in  fact based on  the advances of quantum mechanics. For example, that certain aspects of the Shroud  are fluorescent when bombarded by certain wave lengths of light that the object being bombarded discharges light of a certain wave length. The image itself is not fluorescent.\nHeller and Adler used an early microscopic digital image analyzer. It was, if you  were read their work, a  very exacting process, dependent on the use of tiny portions taken from the Shroud. There work occurred in  the  US on samples of Shroud fibriles taken during the 120 hours. Today, digital-spectral imaging cameras can  examine an artifact and if   carefully controlled is absolutely non-intrusive. \nA  French firm was able to use one  in the Louvre and unlock the original appearance of the Mona Lisa. An explanation of how they did it and the results can be found on t their web site: http://www.lumiere-technology.com/\nUnlike WWII, Scientific study of the Shroud will never end. So maybe it is better to think of STURP as not the end, the beginning of a new era.\nTo look back 36 years at STURP  and carp about  what they were able to do in it’s remarkable 120 hours is well, as the Brit’s would say “a bit much.” What they accomploshed was ground breaking. \nIt was clearly the beginning not of the end but a new ea which, hopefully will end only when humanity does. And then again, according to science that may be sooner, rather than later.\n“\n\n","date":"July 31, 2014 at 7:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/31/okay-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-used-the-word-significant/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Okay, maybe I shouldn’t have used the word ‘Significant’"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"PS, I am in perfect accord with Colin’s basic point: that it’s time for a new “STURP” team study of the Shroud,\n\n","date":"July 31, 2014 at 7:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/31/okay-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-used-the-word-significant/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Okay, maybe I shouldn’t have used the word ‘Significant’"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"When it comes to  the Shroud, unlike Russell’s teapot we know it exists and the issue is: What kind of teapot.? \nThat’s where Science comes in, or at least should come in.

Before 1350? The Templars were safe to come out of hiding by then? It was blessed by the Church that the canons of Lirey could honor the relic of a man burned at the stake a scant four decades before. The objections to the Shroud from the hierarchy, in so far as their were objections was not that it was the relic of Jacques de Molay but that from the very beginning it was being pedaled as THE burial cloth of Christ.\nThe claim that it was EVER anywhere publicly proclaimed to be  a relic of deMolay and that a medallion was forged in his honor for public display is hog wash. No speculation please, names dates places documents connecting the Shroud to de Molay and that someone in 1350 who sought to honor a relic of de Molay would, among other things, be honored to carry the standard of the King of France into battle.

In the Boy Scouts we learned you could  start a fire by using a magnifying glass to capture the sun’s rays.\nHowever, identifying the the image as akin to a scorch doesn’t answer the question, because any light based process doesn’t allow for the high definition of the image except one  – the laser.

Even St. Augustine regarded it as metaphor.\nAs you advance through scripture from Genesis, however, it becomes clear that the metaphorical gets mixed in with actual historical events. Disentangling the metaphor from the actual history becomes a complex process. \nI think it is quite clear that the authors of the New Testament by and large did not believe they were writing metaphor but compiling history from pre-existing traditions or lost original texts.\nIf there is one thing an authentic Shroud does, it is to confirm in great detail, the four Gospel accounts of Christ’s death and point towards his Resurrection.\nHowever,we must be careful in our scriptural exegesis to not take wild assumptions and leaps of faith and disguise them as revealed truth.\nSome fundamentalists do that and the construction of “Jesus took the Shroud with him” is one of those constructs that is actually a theory. Added to the problem are the apocryphal writings that were rejected when the current canon of the New Testament took it present form.\nOne example of biblical exegesis run wild are the recurring apocalyptic prophesies of impending doom. Some Christians at the end of the first millennium were convinced that 1000 AD [CE] would be the year of the Apocalypse. Repeated claims of Apocalypse have been made throughout history since that time.\nOf course, I must confess that I am now a believer in an approaching Apocalypse but it is based not on Scripture but science.

The anomalies were examined under high powered magnification and found to be “dirt.” That dirt was then analysed and found to aragonite. \nNo one found black cookie or bread crumbs.\nIt as absurd a hypothesis as Berry’s early hypothesis that the man in eh Shroud was Jacques de Millay.\nIt is easy to hypothesize when you do not know the facts.

But we just don’t know if in fact such a cloth existed and except for the Sudarium which appears authentic and which if properly analyzed by new scientific tests could, or could not be, matched. By that I mean the kind of  deep “quantum” analysis that was performed by Heller and Adler on the blood from the Shroud. Matching spectra?\nBut here is something that is beyond theory and into the area of speculation. However when it comes to the process of image formation, everything for now is speculation. The importance of the image is that the image “is”.  Is it a part of the great mystery of Christ’s “I am?” We should know better but we tend to still think of the Resurrection in our three dimensional “physical” universe. \nMany decades ago, before I went to college, I remember seeing at the magazine section of a local drug store, a copy of a magazine that popularized scientific issues a cover proclaiming an explanation of time as the fourth dimension. The cover included an illustration of Salvador Dali’s “Persistence of Memory” famous for its drooping watches. When I looked inside the magazine, the entire article was just a few lines referencing the Dali painting. I was disappointed.\nA few years later, I was at a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol attending a two week encampment at Samson Air Force Base at Seneca Lake, We slept in barracks and ate the Air Force food. There are two things that I remember vividly. One was a fellow cadet calling out in the middle of the night “You know that stuff they put in the food?” and then answering the question “It doesn’t work..”\nThe other was a fellow cadet, Melvin Weinstein, from Albany NY who had won a Westinghouse prize at some level or other. I asked him about it and he said “I made  model tesseracts.” “What was that?  I asked. “It’s a four dimension cube,” he replied.   “Want to make one? Get some straws.”\nI did and we did. If you have ever drawn a three dimensional cube on paper which is essential two squares with four corners joined by a slanted lines at the corner, you might be able to visualize what we did. We constructed two three dimensional cubes from straws and then connected the eight corners by straws. I was amazed because it reminded me of a stroboscopic picture I had seen in Life magazine of Ted Williams swing a bat. It was as if the cube was moving through space. The distance traveled being the length of the connecting straws. Time was the fourth dimension,\nFreidman cautioned me that the model of a four dimension cube we had created was not the most accurate. Actually, the cube moving though time expanded in all directions. The proper representation was one cube inside a larger one, joined at the corners. That would have been tough to do with soda straws.\nAssume arguendo the reality of the Resurrection. Something happened to Christ’s body that has no precedent. Dame Isabel Pizcek has referred to the Shroud as an “event horizon.” Perhaps she is right and perhaps that explains the image. We would tend to think of the body as moving through the cloth in a singular direction. But if it was moving into another dimension, or existence, it would have been moving from our perspective in all “directions” or no direction at all. I would suggest that these are issues of quantum mechanics.\nOn the other hand, applying Occam’s Razor, the existence of a head band, as proffered by Dave, may be the simplest solution. :-)\n\n","date":"January 15, 2014 at 8:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Top of Head Puzzle"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"correction: My long-ago friend may have been “Friedman” instead of “Weinstein.” It was 61 years ago,\n\n","date":"January 15, 2014 at 11:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Top of Head Puzzle"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Perhaps the something that is missing is the one thing that the so-called scientific method refuses to recognize: the Resurrection.\n\n","date":"January 15, 2012 at 8:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/15/tough-questions-from-sciencebod/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Tough Questions from Sciencebod"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"I think it is a truncated scientific process that leaves no room for the inexplicable.

It does so essentially without affecting the Shroud and the results available in a digital format are then available indefinitely. There were similar studies made by STURP. The Quad mosaics were a rough analogy but they did not have the ability to allow specification of materials, only differences in gross composition.  A rough analogy would be the ability of the VP-8 analyzer to convert differences of intensity into a tree dimensional representation of the object.\nThe most directly relevant STURP test may have been Heller and Adler using the spectrum of Methemogloben to identify ancient blood.  It might also be possible to identify the the presence or absence of Vanillin at various places on the Shroud. Maybe we could do Arizona’s remaining sample and whatever is left of he Gonella hold back.\nThe process would work on large areas or microscopic.

If the intent is to prove that that the Shroud could have been faked by a “scorch”, so what?\nSome hypothesize that the image was caused by a burst of energy or light. An Italian scientist claims to have come closer than anyone else through the use of a laser process. Essentially, a light scorch.\nLet me introduce you to a former neighbor of mine in Riverdale, the late Martin Tytell. Martin was a questioned document examiner and a forensic expert on typewriters. He was retained by the defense team of Alger Hiss to demonstrate that the stolen cables from the State Department that were retyped by his wife on an Woodstock typewriter could have been faked because it was possible to duplicate the attributes of the Underwood. The claim was the FBI framed Hiss by so doing. By God he did it, although it took two years and the Courts appear disinterested in the results of his labor. Because something can be forged, it doesn’t mean that the thing has been forged. In the case of the Shroud, there is yet no evidence of how the Shroud in toto could have been forged.\nPerhaps Collin Berry should adjust his goals. If his intent is to prove the Shroud is a fake because he can forge a copy, he has failed miserably. IF his intent to to come-up with a process explaining how the image was made, he should keep on, keeping on. There are many in the Shroud world who are ready to accept a “natural” explanation of the image. But then we arrive at a question: what is natural?\nNo one as yet come with in a country mile of duplicating the Shroud image by a natural process. We can get copies made to day that imitate he Shroud but they are copies of the Shroud. The creation process of  the image remains a mystery. No one has produced an original image from scratch that duplicates the Shroud.\nI think there is a corollary of sorts to Occam’s Razor. Exceptional events require exceptional explanations. The Shroud image is an exceptional event. All the frustrated labor that has gone into attempts to create an “original” duplicate have been in vain. By original duplicate I mean a double image of the body of a crucified man with his wounds in exquisite detail created with a maximum of 48 hours that is not a copy of the Shroud itself.  Hasn’t been done yet. \nIf you have to ask me why 48 hours, the answer is simple. The forensic pathologists who have reviewed in detail the Shroud have concluded that it shows evidence of rigor mortis and no evidence of putrefaction. Rigor mortis freezes the muscles soon after death but releases normally in 48 hours. Similarly, putrefaction begins to exude all kinds of nasty stuff after 48 hours. \nStrange coincidence: all four Gospels have Mary Magdalene discovering the empty tomb on Sunday morning at day break – roughly 6:00 AM, approximately 39 hours after Christ expired on the cross.\nI believe that mystery of the image will be finally be resolved, if ever, by reference to a process on the quantum level – the laser, for example,  being essential a quantum mechanical application.\nIs that way out? How about this quotation from a well known, screwball publication (now known as Bloomberg Business Week.)\n“Developing quantum theory was ‘the crowning intellectual achievement of the last century,’ says California Institute of Technology physicist John Preskill. It’s the underlying principle for many of today’s devices, from lasers to magnetic resonance imaging machines. And these may prove to be just the low-hanging fruit. Many scientists foresee revolutionary technologies based on the truly strange properties of the quantum world.”\nBusiness Week, March 15, 2004\nCited in: Rosenblum, Bruce; Kutter, Fred (2011-07-01).

I discuss Heller and Adler in Chapter 9 of my book, The Coming of the Quantum Christ.\nThe device they used was a microspectrophotometer. (MSP). The MSP produced a digital read out of the spectrum of the object. MDI records the spectrum data in a permanent digital file which is then available for detailed examination. All of the spectra including the invisible ones (infrared and ultra violet) are recorded. In essence, MDI combines the Quad Mosaic information with the spectrum information. The actually photographs until processed are black and white similarly to the Quad Mosaic process. \nThere is an excellent presentation of this information on the Lumiere Technology web site which analyzed both the Mona Lisa and La Bella Principessa. See http://www.lumiere-technology.com/discoveries.html. I include a discussion of Lumiere’s work in Chapter 14 of my book which deals with the Shroud’s provenance. \nThe drum I am beating right now is for the use of MDI to analyze the Shroud. (Chapter 18 of my book, its conclusion).It is generally non-destructive. However, the light used to illuminate the work has to be filtered to prevent light pollution.\nWhile the microspectrophotometer may appear “primitive” today, Heller and Adler were able to identify the spectrum of methemoglobin on samples obtained from the Shroud and that meant it was real, very ancient, degraded hemoglobin. \nBut actually this is something we agree on: The utility of employing MDI to analyze the Shroud. The result might be several terabytes or so of data well with the capability of even desktops now.

Seriously. However, when STURP got approval there was a confluence of factors that created the impetus. Foremost was Fr. Rinaldi who bridged the world of Turin and the US. Although some in STURP may be reluctant to recognize it, there was also the impact of Silent Witness which was screened on Italian TV before the final approval was given for STURP (and there was extraordinary support for Silent Witness by Fr. Rinaldi who opened doors in Turin for David Rolfe.)\nI am curious as to whether the wild card in this deal might indeed be the Greek Orthodox. If we win the support of the Greek patriarchs for renewed testing, that might be a voice that Francis would listen too. Their position might be “You can keep the Shroud but you have to allow more scientific examination for you hold it in trust for humanity.” That might be a pipe dream but, maybe not.

Scientific studies have shown “paranormal” or PSI phenomena are real. But, orthodox scientist reject them out of hand because they can’t square such results with there bias against religion. They are “pseudo-skeptics.” The takeaway from Penrose is that consciousness is a quantum activity. We shall see where that leads.\nConsciousness is a key actor in quantum theory. The reason why I closed my blog with John1:1 is quite simple. The “Word” is the primordial consciousness. Thus I would paraphrase it: “In the beginning was the consciousness and consciousness was with God and the consciousness was God.”\nDarwin was reviled as an enemy of religion. It took Teilhard to harmonize evolution and religion and place them in a divine context. I do not believe in the intelligent design description of evolution. But I do believe that evolution has a direction – consciousness evolving from the alpha to the omega. The best is yet to be.\nAs far as theologians, a quite many of them skip around the physical reality of the Shroud. John Meier in Volume One of a Marginal Jew bemoans the fact that Christ left no artifacts. Really? \nSooner or later, the theologians are going to deal withe Shroud and the Quantum Mechanics of existence. I am with Teilhard: neither science nor religion can ignore the other and it is at the quanta the demarcation line vanishes. \nAs far as what the quantum reality of consciousness is,  Mitchell describes it as a quantum hologram. And in the Real face of Jesus, Lawrence Krauss another “atheist” notes that many believe the entire Universe is a hologram. I pray that God gives me the time for I am just beginning to understand.\nI have a question for my physicist source that he should know the answer too, he’s a laser maven.

I think the dividing line is “self”-consciousness.  Teilhard defined the breaking point for humanity from the rest of creation was when the human species attained the power of reflection – self awareness.  (As I am sure you are aware – no pun intended).  I have said that science can be staring God in the face and never see him.\nCertainly there is a movement in Christian theology that I believe tends to define Christ out of existence. The Shroud is what brings Him back. \nAre you familiar with the concept of Boltzmann brains: self conscious entities that pop in and out of existence due to quantum fluctuations? They were theorized by a mathematician-physicist at the dawn of the twentieth century. It’s the self  conscious part that puzzles me. \nTo define what an atheist is, we have to define what God is. I will make a confession, I do not believe in the Garden of Eden and that God walked and talked with our first parents, nor do I believe in Adam and Eve at all. Neither do I believe that God ordered Joshua to massacre the women and children of Jericho. Does that make me an atheist? It certainly would to some fundamentalists. I have corresponded with a professor at Howard who as written on “original” sin being “original selfishness”, one of the driving forces of evolution. He is not an atheist.\nThroughout history what once thought to be a divine mysteries have been explained by science and yet mystery remains. I believe that the quantum enigma(s) we encounter are in fact the fingerprints of the creator, who some, including me, define as the primordial consciousness. I also believe that when in comes to self-conscious entities, entanglement is love, both literally and figuratively.\nOne summer at a Civil Air Patrol Cadet encampment I meant an aspiring physicist from Albany  named, as I recall, Friedman ( his first name may have been Milton, I wouldn’t swear on it). He had won a high school  science award building tesseracts – three dimensional representations of four dimensional objects. He decided to build one with me out of soda straws. When we were finished what we had was two cubes connected together at all points by straws at a 45 degree angle. The unmistakable impression was of a cube moving through space. I was instantly reminded of a time lapse photograph of Ted Williams swinging a baseball bat. My god, I thought: Time is the fourth dimension.\nThis was many decades after Einstein, of course, and a few years after I had first read of the concept. I still have a difficult time understanding what I perceive as the passage of time to be what Einstein explained, but the tesseract “speaks” for itself.\nAs to human consciousness, the key is to be sure we are talking about self-consciousness. All animate objects including plants have a consciousness, however primitive. The great mystery of human existence is self consciousness – Teilhard’s power of reflection. That the brain is a quantum computer (whatever that is) is a start to greater understanding.\nI think reading “word” in St. John for self-conscious entity is an acceptable metaphor for the God who caused the creation Universe.\nAs far as Teilhard being a pantheist, what does that make one the admirers of his visions, Pope Benedict?\n\n","date":"August 23, 2012 at 8:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/22/can-our-consciousness-operate-independent-of-time-and-space/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Can our consciousness operate independent of time and space?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles,\nI don’t mean to be modest, but satisfying me will not be the top item on anybody’s agenda.

No matter how de Charny got it, it was on one level stolen property at some point. I believe I saw at one point but failed to note it, that Clement carefully cadged his approval of he  Shroud so as not to approve of authenticty claims because the Church was still seeking reunion with Orthodox and a claim that it was an authentic artifact of Christ would engender Orthodox demands for its return. (Which would have by the way made in vulnerable to the Islamists armies who were on the move.) Do you have any thoughts on that.\nI have a riff on Dawkins in my first chapter because he has a dim view of eye witness testimony and actually prefers solid circumstantial evidence. That’s because in archaeology-anthropology  there are no eye witnesses. \nBias is usually a slur. However, I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag, but it is my opinion that the weight of the circumstantial evidence is authenticity. Can’t defend that in a few hurried, and often typo filled,  comments on a blog. But I do not believe that the inability to draw a conclusion from evidence already offered is a disqualification if the mind is open. \nBy the way, by reason of the personal experiences of someone very close to me, I have observed the National Institute of Health (NIH) for two decades. There is fierce competition for grants. Is there fraud  by some, you betcha. (Palinease for “You bet there is”) Fraud is NOT endemic. Pride is.  the NIH has funded programs of ultimate value far beyond its budget.\nOverall the NIH is grant program a most valuable and necessary component of US science and one of the bedrock for the US’s scientific and economic progress. You double betcha. \nLet me say this once in sum. The carbon labs waged a determined effort to keep STURP out of the carbon dating process and to stop any further scientific tests if the carbon date was not within range of 30 CE. STURP had one function in the tests: to select the best sites for taking samples. Because STURP was excluded from the process, the worst possible site was chosen.\nSurely you must realize that for  carbon dating the sample must be  typical of the entire object. It wasn’t. But those chapters are already written and I have to move on and not debate it further. \nMy work will speak for itself (if anybody gets to read it). Frankly, I am impressed by the support I’ve gotten. I even have permission  from Elaine Pagels author of the Gnostic Gospels to use a long quote from her book (God bless the Internet). I’ll use it now since it is not original with me: It’s from Chapter Two, working title: The Story as Told.”\n“Then she puts martyrdom in the context of Christ’s passion in words that echo Pasternak:\n‘In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.'”\nFinally, show a little respect for those whose opinions differ from you.

He is coming back. If I may change metaphors in mid-stream, the Shroud is Christ’s magic carpet which he is riding back into our consciousness. I can envision a magic carpet more readily than a bike as shroud. It’s carpet magically woven by science.\nI said “coming back.” Now I personally don’t recommend rushing down to to Jones Beach or any other handy open space to await the Rapture. Allegories and metaphors are representations of the truth and not always intrinsically true in themselves. That’s why among fundamentalists there are “pre-millenialists” and “post-millenialists.” But the decades of scientific study of the Shroud are beginning to register. He is returning to or consciousness in ways previously unimagined. Perhaps prophesied?\nIn Heller’s book, he wrote that after he came into possession of a fiber, he wanted to examine it as closely as possible for blood so he put on his white lab coat and went to his lab where the best equipment  was.\nHow about this from Revelations:\n“These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They\nhave washed their robes and made them white in the blood\nof the Lamb.” Revelations 7:14\nAre scientists in their white lab coats bringing Christ to us?\nOn the other hand there is Joe Nickell, a man with no scientific credentials per se seeking to debunk the Shroud who loves to pose in a “white lab coat.”\n“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” Matthew 7:15-20\nCan a lab coat also be “sheep’s clothing.\nThat may apply to the carbon labs also.

Scripture tells the story of humanity striving to overcome that selfishness. The antithesis of selfishness is love. \nI believe hat the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ teaches us that love, in the end, conquers. As Saint Paul wrote: there exist these three Faith, Hope and Love. The greatest of these is Love for in eternity Faith and Hope will pass away while Love shall endure forever.\nIt has been more than a hundred years since Secondo Pia first discovered the meaning and vitality of the image of the Shroud. No one has explained the process of how that image was created. Many have tried. What Colin Berry and the WAG that Dan posted demonstrate is that it is a childish exercise. \nTo paraphrase St. Paul: it’s time to put the childish things aside. Ecce Homo!\nYou may think am avoiding your arguments but I rely on the arguments of scientists like Heller, Adler and the others of  the STURP team. These were people of scientific accomplishment before they went to Turin. I’ll take their word. Have you ever examined an actual fiber of he Shroud or do you rely on interpreting pictures taken by others?\nDo you consider yourself a superior scientist to Ray Rogers?\n\n","date":"November 26, 2013 at 9:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"At the risk of sounding like someone with faith, which a “true” scientist wouldn’t have, I believe that at the end of the day, the simplest explanation for the image of the Shroud is a process connected to the Resurrection. I also believe that someday “science” will recognize that fact. \nI think that much of the confusion about the distortions of the image arises from the fact hat the body was not flat at the instant when the image was formed. Forensic pathologists such as Bucklin and Zugibe have found that the body was in a state of rigor mortis. In Chapter 14 of Zugibe’s book “The Crucifixion of Christ: A Forensic Inquiry” he spends a lot of ink discussing “rigor mortis” which he found in the exemplified by the man in the shroud. Between Bucklin and Zugibe  there are some  disagreement about how crucifixion cause death s but the fact that rigor mortis was present is not in dispute.\nZugibe points out that it was necessary for Joseph of Arimithea and whoever else helped him in entombing  Christ to “break the rigor mortis” because since  the man in the  shroud was a crucifixion victim his arms would have stiffened at the moment of death in an extended position. That also meant as frequently pictured that his knees were bent and his head and neck when he was laid flat slightly elevated. Because of that measurement of his actually height has must be adjusted.\nNow whatever  the precise image creation process, it reflects the body still in a position of rigor mortis and that means by the Gospel accounts before 3:00PM on the Sunday following the crucifixion. All four Gospel accounts describe Mary Magdalene discovering the body missing at daybreak on that Sunday.\nThe rigor mortis is one fact established by science that supports a “theory” of Resurrection and adds weight to the conclusion that the Shroud is not a forgery. It’s just one fact but that fact of rigor mortis is a relevant one.\nIt is interesting but maybe not terribly relevant that the digital pictures I take are sometimes distorted. For  example, a picture of my dog Bogart (a/k/a “Bogie”) that I once published on my blog shows his head abnormally large in comparison to his body when he was in a sitting position. Also my wife last night was conversing with her niece in Chicago on Skype using her I-Phone. The appearance of her niece’s face close-up was also distorted. Her nose for example appeared much larger vis-a-vis her face.\nThe very distortions that some see in the shroud man are not the result of an “incompetent” artist but likely caused by the time of the image creation when the man in the shroud was in a state of rigor mortis. Now maybe someone can dispute rigor mortis. Okay, go ahead but only forensic pathologists may apply.\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Some people find he debates on this blog a waste of time.

However, I have never regarded the historical provenance (since its creation circa 30 CE) to be an issue. To me providence is the interesting aspect of the Shroud.\nThe issue is authenticity and we may never know a complete provenance of the Shroud from time it disappeared from the tomb until it was displayed in Lirey circa 1350 CE and I am really not sure that matters.\nMartin Kemp is a colleague of yours (I mean a fellow art historian) who made a quite a splash with is involvement authenticating a drawing of a young woman as an original daVinci. A few years earlier, Christies had  evaluated at $20,000 and sold it on consignment. A couple of years later, a new owner showed it to a visitor. He had it stashed in a drawer and the visitor told him that it looked like a da Vinci. Enter Martin Kemp of Oxford, a da Vinci specialist. The known provenance of La Principessa was only from the late nineteenth century at best.\nHe made an exacting scientific examination and determined after that examination that it was a genuine da Vinci and its worth ballooned to over $100,000,000,  .let me spell it out: one hundred million dollars. \nKemp became the center of a heated debate. His finding was disputed (if not ridiculed) by other experts. He continued his attempts to  determine its earlier provenance. He was successful. In Poland he found a folio that celebrated the wedding of a Italian noble’s illegitimate daughter. The noble was a da Vinci patron. She was, as I recall only thirteen and died from complications of pregnancy a few months after her wedding. The folio was bound on the left side. There were holes on the left side of the La Principessa that matched the binding of the folio.\nIt was impossible to determine when La Principessa was removed from the folio, but it was. We (and Kemp)  do not know the name of the thief and in what era he operated. However, the discovery of the folio was definitive as to provenance. \nNot the gaps in possession and provenance that span centuries. Note the deciding  factor as holes that matched the binding. Note the acceptance of the La Principessa and the astronomical jump in its evaluation.\nAs far as the Shroud is concerned, Kemp recently wrote a book on icons: From Christ to Coke. He identified the image of Christ as the greatest of historical icons.\nAlas, he indicated at one point in his book that he was more or less an agnostic. (He kind of let that slip.) It’s my interpretation of what he wrote.\nHe dismisses the Shroud as early Renaissance from the north of Italy or France. He apparently did this a merely a visual observation of photographs of the Shroud. He certainly did not conduct the actual painstaking examination that he did with La Principessa. Seriously, if here is one thing the STURP examinations demonstrated: it was not a painting.\nI am not ready to write iy today but this episode will be recited in my manuscript. Here’s the important fact. Based on his evaluation, the value of La Principessa was increased by a factor of 10,000X. And there are still huge gaps in his provenance and there is no chain of title complete from da Vinci’ patron to modern times. Indeed, the determining fact were binding holes in the side of the drawing. Matching holes – there is something about that. Can you think of an analogy?\nI can, guess what?\n{I am writing this on the fly. I would really appreciate your prospective on this, or if I misstated anything – in your opinion. I am familiar with your dismissal of the poker holes (which were not poker holes).\n\n","date":"January 9, 2014 at 8:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/07/keep-it-simple-can-anyone-help/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Keep it Simple: Can Anyone Help?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Keep at it Charles. Your opinions and expertise are valuable. I commend all those who are dedicated to tracking the complete provenance from Tomb to Turin. If it is ever unraveled I am sure that it will be a fascinating story full of interesting characters, some  saints, some not so saintly.\nRecently in my draft which is now up to date and has only the ramification chapters to go, I referred to the resignation of Benedict and the fact that-his greatest gift to the Church may have been establishing a precedent for elderly popes to resign rather than clinging to their office even though severely incapacitated. (The idea of the being Benedict’s greatest gift is not original with me but I can’t put a finger on where I read it right now.)\nHere’s what I have written:\n“Benedict had been a confident of his predecessor and was at his side throughout his decline. In 2013, Benedict was a year older than John Paul was at the time of his death. There is no reason not to take Benedict’s stated reason at face value and in his resignation he established a precedent for other popes in declining years. The precedent he set may very well be his greatest contribution to the Church. He certainly fared better than the last previous pope to truly voluntarily resign: Pope Celestine XII in 1294. He wished to return to his pre-papacy life as a hermit. Alas, Celestine was arrested by his successor and died a papal prisoner”\nThe irony is that after I wrote that and put Chapter 13 to bed, I discovered on a lamp table a book about Celestine. I asked my wife about it. It turns out she had purchased it at Barnes and Noble but hadn’t gotten into it yet: Coincidence, providence, provenance????\nGo figure.\n\n","date":"January 9, 2014 at 11:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/07/keep-it-simple-can-anyone-help/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Keep it Simple: Can Anyone Help?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"One more thing.

For example, I believe I posted a bit on Father Rinaldi including a link to a Sign Magazine article that he wrote in 1934 when still a seminarian in Italy.\nThat article was the beginning of the serious Shroud study  in the US for it attracted the attention of many thousands of Catholics including Father Wuenschel who went on to found the Holy Shroud Guild.  Fr. Rinaldi who immigrated to he US became, along with Fr. Otterbein, a star in the Shroud world. Rinaldi was probably the single most important person 44 years later in STURP being formed and in gaining access to the Shroud (I don’t mean to gainsay the contributions and organizational talents of Dr. Robert Jackson in writing that). \nWhen my book is complete, you will be able to read about it. That chapter is already drafted and has received favorable reviews from those I shared it with privately and  who commented. It’s not for publication yet.\nMy digging Rinaldi’s article out of an archive in Pennsylvania got some attention from some very interesting quarters including one across the Pond in GB.\nI really don’t want to be so defensive about this but I do resent the “loony” part. Has someone profiled me and  figured out how to get under my skin? Not that I am paranoid or anything.\nThe working title of my manuscripts is: “The Coming of the Quantum Christ: The Shroud of Turin and the Future of Science and Humanity.” I owe a portion of that title to Dame Isabel Pizek who once said: “The future of science is the Shroud of Turin.”\nThe reason she could say that is ultimately I think she believes as I do, that the issue of the Shroud image will be resolved at the level of quantum mechanics. Now if you want loony, try quantum mechanics. Richard Dawkins, the atheist pope (my description cc) is quoted in the introduction to my manuscript drafted a year ago:\n“Perhaps there are some genuinely profound and meaningful questions that are forever beyond the reach of science. Maybe quantum theory is already knocking on the door of the unfathomable. But if science cannot answer some ultimate question, what makes anybody think that religion can?”\nNow that’s loony, or is it?\n\n","date":"January 12, 2013 at 8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/11/living-free-the-thomas-aquinas-and-pierre-teilhard-de-chardin-part/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Living Free: The Thomas Aquinas and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Part"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Gabriel,\nThat is a direct quote from Isabel Pizek. She may have been quoting a  European physicist when she said it. I don’t know what your position is on the Shroud or the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The are some who take the attitude I guess of the old song: “How do I know, the Bible tells me so.” Biblical interpretation (exegesis) is not easy and to read the Bible as something dictated by God with human authors playing stenographers doesn’t do justice to the Bible, the putative stenographers or, for that matter, God.\nIf the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, and I believe it is, then the simplest solution to the mystery of its image is the Resurrection. At that point it becomes the most important object on the face of the Earth. \nI believe that ultimately it will be science that will unlock the mystery of the image and I  believe it will be unlocked at the quantum level of existence. (The late Ray Rogers has already been there in one sense, a tiny fingerprint of the quantum is in his calculations.) \nThe quantum, IMVHO is the interface between the primordial consciousness (God) from which our existence sprung at the Big Bang and that existence.

How many does that represent compared to the number of abortions. The whole point is contraception and health services. Is it not a fact that the number far exceeds the number of pregnant women who receive abortions.?\nI am not a proponent of abortion as birth control or being used as an excuse to ignore reasonable precautions. Every abortion is a failure. Sometimes the reasons for the abortion arise from natural circumstances beyond the control of the woman, her doctor, her husband or companion. The cases I cited: two in which the Catholic Church penalized individuals who acceded to an abortion where the life of the mother was in stake and one in Ireland where Catholic doctors enforced anti-abortion laws and the mother died – as the doctors knew she would.\nSince you seem conversant with the figures, how many women received health related services from PP WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. That would certainly include health screenings and contraception. I believe the number would be far, far in excess of those who were pregnant. And if PP were a single minded abortion organization, how did those who were pregnant escape its clutches with their pregnancy intact? Could be that PP helped the women carry to term? Do you know? Your statement indicates that many women received pre-natal care. Where those women go if PP were defunded?\nBy the way, do you believe contraception other than the rhythm method is immoral? Do you believe all the women who sought contraception aid from PP were immoral? Do you believe that all the women who received cancer screenings and or health assistance were immoral?\nDo you believe that a doctor who refuses to perform an abortion knowing that the woman would die acted morally?\nDo you believe that your morality should be enforced on women and doctors  by the criminal code?\nAre you married Andy? Do you have a wife? Have you ever comforted a wife through a difficult pregnancy? Have you ever told a wife, you are going to have to die because of my/our religious beliefs?\nSince you seek to enforce your religious beliefs through the civil and criminal law on others, these are relevant questions. \nI see that in response to the furor over the female ordination controversy a single male who was a member of Opus Dei who had taken a vow of celibacy. Don’t you find that a little weird? I do. If a single male can handle celibacy, his place would probably be with the celibate clergy – either brother or priest.\nBy the way, I have never advised a woman to have an abortion. And my advice has been asked. The circumstances are private.\nI expect that a large number of individuals who accept the authenticity of the Shroud or at least find it reasonable are “Right to Life” adherents who oppose abortions under all circumstances. That is their choice. When it comes to appropriate civil and criminal law in a pluralistic society, my choice is different.\n\n","date":"January 14, 2013 at 10:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/11/living-free-the-thomas-aquinas-and-pierre-teilhard-de-chardin-part/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Living Free: The Thomas Aquinas and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Part"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Colin,\nDan had my explicit decision to re post my article rather than simply link to it.

For example the highest resolution of these photos appears to 64X in item 5-2. Brown went to more than 3000x for his Scanning Electronic Microscope photographs.\n While each discipline as some thing to add, each is in its own way is incomplete. We are literally like the blind man and the elephant. Or to turn to another cliche, we have to see the forest that is composed of the trees. The fact is that STURP was multi-disciplinary. \nFor example when Machthild Flury-Lemberg says there cotton throughout the Shroud was she talking about transients isolated fibers like some of fibers we see in these 32X or 64X photos, Or is he talking about something she observed at 3000x with a SEM? Did she use a pocket magnifier? Was the power as high as 32X? I have my doubts she used 64X or even 32X.

The Shroud image as been examined down to the atomic level. It showed no signs of directionality  in the strokes and no direction in the lighting. There were no evidence of pigments in the image itself. Was the “artist” left or right handed? A good art critic or historian can tell. If I ever get my current chapter finished, I will dissect one of the most famous ones as a part of the next and demonstrate how his casual opinion of the Shroud was at odds with his own professional discipline.

The Shroud, here and now existent, unites us. Teilhard predicted a merger of science and religion and that is now at the Shroud.

It’s our challenge to act it.\nAs a result of a quick internet research for this comment, I discovered that the hymn was written by Peter Scholtes in the 1960s a priest who later left the priesthood but not Christianity.

Is it a snake, a tree, or a wall?\nMy approach, which may seem limited, is to concentrate on two appetites of the Shroud: the body image and the blood. To paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, everything else is commentary.\nThere seems to be a repetitive error that OK addresses: when criticizing the proportions of the Shroud image as being distorted or apart from presumed norm they elide a fundamental aspect of the image. Using a film analogy, the film was not flat and the image was projected askew. \nCan any one imagine taking a picture with film that is not flat but rumpled and curled? I think OK demonstrated that there had to be distortion. I once posted a picture of my dog, Bogart AKA Bogie taken digitally. There was an immense distortion with his head appearing larger than his body. That doesn’t prove anything except that if the image was created on the Shroud by whatever process and the Shroud was not perfectly taut or the image created at an angle then the image would be distorted. \nAny photographic expert care to argue with that?\nSecond, a painted copy by an artist is a painted copy by an artist. What one may ask: what was he copying? It appears reasonable that copies of copies of an original object would degrade from the reality of the object. Even photographs when copied degrade with anomalies. That’s one reason why the arguments about what the Shroud shows degrade with the generation of the copy.\nIn the end we are left with an existing physical object in Turin Italy that is traceable to circa 1350.\nThe art historians among us continue to ignore a scientific fact that is actually proven beyond “reasonable doubt.” The Shroud image is not painting. They also ignore another scientific fact: the blood on the Shroud is ancient blood. The D’Arcis memorandum is a hoax and there is evidence that it was elaborated on by Chevalier and Thurston. Thurston adopted Chevalier’s arguments so he is not intellectually culpable.\nSo these are facts about the Shroud that I submit have been proven: the Shroud is not a painting and the blood is real.\nA final note: one of the egregious errors is the manner in which Shroud skeptics label any scientist whose work they disagree with as a person blinded by religious belief. Alan Adler, who did his work after 1978, was Jewish so was Barrie Schwortz and other members of the Shroud team who were in Turin. According to Schwortz, before the 120 hours of Turin examination in 1978, most of the participants were skeptics of authenticity and expected to find that the image was painted and they could go home. They were surprised. It’s been 36 years, many have passed away. Most that still survive have yet to go home.\n\n","date":"December 4, 2014 at 8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"No Charles, we shall say it has been proved and you are not a forensic pathologists or blood expert.

When was the body wrapped in the Shroud and were there two shrouds or burial cloths. \nAs to issue one, I am not sure we can ever have a definitive answer. Colin’s metaphor “body bag” to indicate that he was wrapped when taken down from the cross may seem a bit cheeky but that’s Colin. However, I did not detect, and maybe I read it too quickly an argument for a second Shroud. There’s is no evidence of that.\nIt is absolutely clear that the body was not fully prepared in the time that it was removed from the cross and first placed in the tomb. And before final preparations the body “disappeared.”\n“39 And Nicodemus also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight. 40 They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 41 Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid. 42 There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.” (John 19: 39-42 (Rheims Duoay Kindle Edition)\nBecause the body  was not fully prepared it is ridiculous to claim that scripture, or anything else,  supports a second authentic shroud. Also, the concept that Nicodemus brought spices and stuff on a donkey that were twigs and leaves is if you pardon the pun, is made-up of “whole cloth.” [I am not sure if that’s an Americanism or Shakespeare but it means “not true.”]\nBy the way, I got an education on Wikipedia from a History professor yesterday who was intrigued by the failed attempt by Charles Freedman to post a pseudo-third party Wiki  entry as to his History Today theory. She had given her class an assignment to either make or edit a Wiki entry as demonstrations of how to use or not use it. \nShe explained the proper method that might pass muster. I owe Charles a debt of gratitude for engendering my private seminar. We shall see what we shall see.\nGiven Colins most recent post, he continues to make valuable contributions.

Two comments: You are a gifted scholar and your work parallels some of the things I wll write about in the Second Part of my manuscript. The working title of the whole manuscript is: “The Coming of the Quantum Christ: The Shroud of Turin and the Future of Science and Humanity.” You referenced quite early in your piece “militant atheism.” \nSo “in the clear” are the first three paragraphs of my introduction:\n“We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Every day we make decisions after weighing the available facts. But almost always we have doubts. Fear the person who has no doubt. Think George Armstrong Custer.  If we only acted in the absence of doubt, we would probably seldom act at all. Even Mother Theresa, who devoted her life to caring for the most desperate of the residents of the Calcutta slums, confessed to moments of black doubt.\n“Unfortunately, one of the hallmarks of the current era are people who profess freedom from doubt under circumstances where doubt would seem to be a reasonable proposition. For example, newly militant atheists are crusading against any form of religion and express no doubt about the absence of any God of any kind. They claim to arrive at their conclusions by the dispassionate application of the scientific method. Foremost among the militant atheists is Oxford Don Richard Dawkins whose literary rant against religion, The God Delusion, has sold more than two million copies since it was published in 2005. The cover jacket for Delusion, modestly describes Dawkins has “the world’s most prominent atheist” (the “atheist pope” so to speak), \n“Opposed to the atheistic militants are, among others, young earth fundamentalists be they Christian, Islamic or Jewish. To those fundamentalists, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary, the world is a scant 6,000 years old and man walked with dinosaurs. Indeed, to some, the Grand Canyon is but an artifact of Noah’s flood. They are but cat’s paw for the atheistic militants who delight in demonstrating their absurdities. Nonetheless, the most potent weapon of the militant atheists, aside from acerbic wit, is their scientific credentials.”\nAgain, if you want to correspond try klotzlaw@gmail.com\n\n","date":"November 27, 2013 at 10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"What Colin and his fellow travelers overlook is the simple fact that there isn’t a crucifix anywhere that presents the accurate anatomical details of the Shroud of Turin.

The body and the Shroud parted company therefore at a very early time after death. Whatever conditions of the tomb (dampness, cool temperature) that would have extended the time of rigor mortis and delayed putrefaction are almost irrelevant because there is no evidence of such having occurred. So if the conditions of the tomb would have extended the time from 48 hours to several days means only that the event of Resurrection could have occurred later that the approximately 30 hours or so of the Scripture accounts. (9 hours on Friday, 24 hours on Saturday and six hours to daybreak on Sunday). \nThat putrefaction is delayed by cool temperature is a well known fact. In Rogers & Hammerstein’s musical Oklahoma there is a song “Poor Jud is Dead.” The last the verse is:\n“He’s lookin’ oh so purty and so nice\nHe looks like he’s asleep\nIt’s a shame that he won’t keep\nBut it’s summer and we’re runnin’ out a’ ice”\nIsabel Piczek described the image as an event horizon. Scientifically, the most commonly known event horizon is the observable last gasp of matter as it is sucked into a black hole. Actually a sunset is a rough metaphor. The sun sinks below the horizon but we know of its presence because the horizon remains light for some moment of time.\nI think that when it comes to image formation that Jackson’s probably on the right track. None of the theories of image formation that claim to be purely natural work and any theory that obdurately refuses to take into account the Resurrection, probably won’t work.\nChrist’s body was transforming from state of existence that we know to another that we can’t really explain – yet. The complex theories of consciousness and quantum theory intrude deeply into basic questions that were in the past reserved for religion. Some of them tend towards solipsism – nothing exists until it is perceived and then only in the consciousness of the viewer. \nThose who insist on a natural explanation for the image formation process without reference to the Resurrection are doomed to fail. Ray Rogers who advanced the theory of a maillard reaction admitted that it alone did not explain the image.\nThe image is miraculous. That only means that we can not explain it   yet.\n\n","date":"November 7, 2015 at 7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/07/a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"A Guest Posting by O.K."},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"OK,\nI don’t have time to go into particulars and I am not sure what you mean.

We need Napoleon referred to as two o’clock in the morning courage. Sunrise is a curative of doubt.\nBut what of the Resurrection? Does the Shroud “prove” the Resurrection. I do believe that it is consistent with Resurrection. That is it does not disprove the Resurrection. But the great unknown s the process of image formation. I think there are twp poles here. One is represented by Jackson, Fanti et al who argue that the process involved in the creation points towards Resurrection and the other by the late Ray Rogers who insisted that he didn’t believe in miracles and searched, fruitlessly for a natural explanation he never successfully articulated (as he himself admitted).\nSo we are at an impasse. But that is not to say the impasse that will never be broken. Science has shed light  much of what humanity used to be believe was a miracle. Indeed, Science may in fact be doing God’s handiwork in revealing the true majesty and glory of existence. As Science opens avenues of existence to explore, we should not be too surprised if at the one of those avenues we glimpse the Creator.

Of all those crucified, how many fairly contemporaneous accounts of the specific crucifixion of a specific individual are there? How many specific accounts of sch specific individual being buried in a linen shroud. How many specific written accounts of such specific individuals are that that that the specific individual was wrapped in a Shroud and place in a tomb hewn from rock?  How many specific accounts of women  finding the specific individual’s tomb empty?\nHow many answers to even one of those questions are there? And one more, how many references by a Roman historian are there to a specific executed individual of a cult in Judea that spread to Rome even after there was an attempt to quash it by his execution?\nI can think of only one individual who meets those criteria. Names please (and sources).\nHugh stated in referenced cases “anyone of then might have merited a mock helmet.” Point is there is no record of any of them being crucified with a mock helmet. Here we have written accounts of crucifixion with a mock crown which at the time would have been in the form of a cap rather than a  medieval circle of gold or other metal of only one individual. Guess who?\nThere seems to me to be a certain arrogance of true believers who have the “gift of faith” and  no need of science. Therefore, they do their best to destroy a scientific road to faith for others. The study of the Shroud is the study of science.\nI am a Teilhardest in that I believe that science and religion can no longer trod separate paths. The basic issues of religion including the potential for eternal life of the self-consciousness are now subject of scientific inquiry. It appears that some “salvation by faith alone” people are threatened by that. Why? “You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.” Does anyone have a problem with that.

The thrust of the TOF post was history, not science. I look forward to informed comments in this chain on history pre Lirey of the Shroud including expected skeptical denials.  – even from Colin.\nI would hope the skeptics would supply reason for that refutation of the history discussed at length in the TOF post with something more than invective.\nOne of the comments on TOF blog itself was the claim that the posting had plagiarized Markwardt and Scavone. That would be difficult because Markwardt and Scavone have a scholarly disagreement about the timing of the arrival of the Shroud in Constantinople. Markwardt places it there earlier than either Scavone or Wilson has written. \nMoreover, you can’t plagiarize history. One case on that point was Harry Lincoln’s ill-fated lawsuit against Dan Brown. Lincoln was one of the four authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail (HBHG). He claimed that Brown had plagiarized HBHG in the DaVinci Code because he wrote of the Knights Templar having possession of the Shroud at some point. Brown won the law suit because of a very simple legal proposition: You can’t plagiarize history. What can’t be plagiarized are the author’s words if they are uniquely his or hers. Brown, Scavone and Wilson are writing historical texts. Any event that they report as an historical event can be reported as history by another author, but the second author can not do so in the original author’s unique own words without attribution.\nIncidentally, to accuse an author of plagiarism without a factual-legal basis might be actionable slander. For example, I quote Tacitus, Boris Pasternak and Elaine Pagels in quotations of paragraph length or more in my book Quantum Christ with proper attribution and in Pagel’s case with her explicit permission. The other two authors were deceased at the time of my writing. Were someone to criticize me for saying I plagiarized those authors, that would potentially be a slander. Were they say I had just copied Tacitus or Pasternak, that would not be slander.\nOne omission from the TOF post which is very relevant is a discussion of the Justinian coins that demonstrate “Vignon markings.” Both Wilson and Markwardt have written of them.\nYou can read or download Markwardt’s presentation at the 2014 St. Louis conference at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmarkwardtpaper.pdf  It is documented with 251 footnotes.

There is a tendency of the agonostic/atheist scientific community (not all scientists) to accept the carbon dating at face value because it comports with their world view and they can not deal with an authentic relic of Christ. \nIn my manuscript I give as an example the late Carl Sagan writing in his posthumously published book “Billions and Billions.”\n“ ‘If we can measure the amount of radioactive parent material and the amount of daughter decay product in a sample, we can determine how long the sample has been around. In this way we find that the so-called Shroud of Turin is not the burial shroud of Jesus, but a pious hoax from the fourteenth century (when it was denounced by Church authorities)…'(Emphasis added) \n“The basis of Sagan’s curt brush-off of the Shroud was the D’Arcis memorandum discussed in Chapter 4. As noted, it is doubtful that the memorandum was ever delivered to Pope Clement and it was entirely based upon a hearsay statement uttered years before. D’Arcis claimed that his predecessor as bishop was told by an artist that he had painted the Shroud. Yet, the Shroud is not a painting. If there is a hoax at work, it is the claim that the Shroud is a painting. That hoax has been thoroughly debunked.\n“The scientific evidence that the Shroud is not a painting is overwhelming.

In attempting to rebut the finding of\nItalian scientists’ “new evidence” that demonstrated that image of a crucified\nman on the Shroud could not be faked, he wrote:\n“The new ‘evidence’ amounts to yet another ‘Argument from\nPersonal Incredulity’: the Italian scientists cannot understand\nhow it could have been faked.

Three independent labs, in\nArizona, Zurich and Oxford, were each given four samples,\nmaking 12 dating in all” (p. 13, Coming of the Quantum Christ)..\nThat he got his facts wrong, implying that there were twelve samples carbon dated is a given. That he ignores the evidence of the anomalous nature of the sample site is an inconvenient fact that he does not either know or chooses to ignore – or rebut.\nIn any event, he, as I stated my previous post, used the carbon “rock-solid” carbon dating to debunk the Shroud.\nD=I do’t mean to str a debate but I just wanted to get the record straight.\n\n","date":"September 27, 2014 at 6:32 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/25/mars-weeping-mary-and-the-shroud/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Mars, Weeping Mary and the Shroud"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"I missed your typo just as I often miss mine.\n\n","date":"September 25, 2014 at 11:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/25/mars-weeping-mary-and-the-shroud/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Mars, Weeping Mary and the Shroud"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"John,\nI am not as simpleminded as I may appear on occasion.

(I did manage to sneak one of JFK’s most elegant quotes from his speech an American University in Section C, The Challenge to Humanity in Chapter 18, the Challenge of the Shroud \n“For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s futures. And we are all mortal.”\nJohn F. Kennedy\nAmerican University\nJune 10, 1963\nThe point is there exist establishments that can not, or will not, deal with facts that are incompatible with their world view. In the Kennedy case it is, among others things, much of the mainstream media. In 1993, I wrote a two page Op-Ed for Newsday about the phenomenon entitled “Why the Media Want the Inquiries to end.” It was placed by Newsday on the Washington Post-LA Times news wire and has been referred to by one Warren report skeptic as the “best short summary of our position.” It may still be cited by other web pages on the Internet\nSee http://www.johnklotz.com/new-jfk.htm\nIn the piece I wrote about the NY Times initial attitude about the Warren Report:\n“When the Warren report was issued in September, 1964, the media greeted it with universal praise. Its most popular edition was published by The New York Times. The introduction, written by Assistant Managing Editor Harrison Salisbury, pronounced,  ‘No material question now remains unresolved, as far as the death of President Kennedy is concerned.’ To critics of the Warren Commission, Salisbury flashed a contemptuous warning: Those who spread irresponsible rumors about the assassination were either seeking to sow distrust and confusion among the public or intent on conveying to foreign countries the ‘image of a violent America, helpless in the face of dangerous forces.'”\nThe issues are different and so is the establishment seeking to still threatening voices. In the Shroud’s case it is that part of the the Scientific establishment that can not deal with the possible reality of Jesus Christ and his purported Resurrection. \nWhen it comes to the Shroud, JFK is an aside, except what it can teach us about how establishments -political or scientific – react to challenges to their world view. The fancy word for the process is “marginalization.” It is certainly at work in the study of the Shroud and the credibility wrongfully bestowed on the carbon dating continues to be the principal method of marginalizing Shroud studies. Yet, in neither the Kennedy casen or the Shroud, has the marginalization ended debate or study.

While I can be critical of various popes, I think this is a bad rap. If anything, the Church is too often sweeping with a broad brush in its pronouncements. \nGeorges Lemaitre was a priest-scientists who first proposed the big bang theory of the creation of the Universe. He was for many ears the subject of scorn from other scientists. The atheists-agnostics wanted a Universe that always was and was never never. Pope Pius XI wrote to Lemaitre  that he has “proven” Genesis and the creation of the Universe by God. Lemaitre demurred. He cautioned the pope to be careful. Any scientific theory that is true today may be disproved tomorrow. \nPius XI was indeed a remarkable man. As a young priest he had climbed the Alps with a young French man named Paul Vignon.  That was before Vignon had a breakdown from which emerged the man we (at least all most all of us) honor for his work on the Shroud.Pius XI also wrote an encyclical attacking the Hitler and the Nazi’s that was released in late 1938 after his death. But Lemaitre was right, the Church must be careful before declaring any work of scholarship as true or false as a matter of faith. Again, I believe that it has been too quick to reveal truth at times. What it must be is open. The case of Galileo is an excellent example. Then too, there was Joan of Arc.\nGarry Wills placed St. Peters martyrdom at the time of Nero. He may have been a flaming torch at a Nero bacchanalia. He was probably betrayed by other Christians. So too was Paul.\nI realize that there are other scholars much more knowledgeable than I who on this blog who might have differing views, But I find the Church’s attitude of cautious reverence to be quite appropriate. \nOn the other hand, the bones of St. Peter are not the singular Shroud of Turin. The Crucifixion of Christ as “King of the Jews” was a singular event. There were undoubtedly in sum thousands of martyrs. There are thousands of martyrs being suffering this day at the hands of radical Islamists (not all Moslems by any means). \nThe claims of crucifixion and the details of crucifixion are set forth in four written accounts that date to traditions which arose at the time of his death and resurrection. We may have lost the earliest written accounts but the existence of the traditions is attested to not just the Gospels but by the martyrdom of those who proclaimed the Resurrection and faced sure death as a result.\nI may be on dangerous found here, but I am  not willing to accept on as a matter of faith the opinion of one scholar as to the identity of St. Peter’s bones. That’s not duplicity. That’s caution.\n\n","date":"November 22, 2013 at 8:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/22/quote-for-today-13/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Quote for Today"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"To say that something can be forged is not evidence that it was forged.

Is it wrong to rely on science to either support or deny faith? There is an attitude that faith must stand independent of science and that those who attempt to harmonize faith and science are somehow lesser Christians. I guess I am guilty of this.\nFor the better part of two millenia faith had demanded that we accept a story of the Garden of Eden and the forbidden fruit as the source the “original sin” which tained all of humanity. had it not been for Adam and Eve there would have been no death and no work.\nWe know know that that was a metaphor. Advanced theologians who were also scientists like Pierre teilhard de Chardin sought to redefine the faith in terms of evolution. The scientist who first proposed the “Big Bang” theory was a Belgium priest who was excoriated by the scientific community including some atheists.\nI think we are long past the moment when we should flee scientific proof of the authenticity of the Shroud. We do not organize our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. To say, I turn my back on science because my faith has no doubt is to limit your world and your faith. (That is not an accusation of you, Louis, it’s just something I read and hear from others.)\nBy all the standards of evidence we use in law, the evidence that the Shroud is authentic is overwhelming except for the disputed carbon dating. The atheists cling to carbon dating the way some believers cling to their inerrant bible. Better, perhaps, to “Cling to that Old Rugged Cross.”\nScience is now approaching the complex question of human consciousness of self and its nature. The answer will lie in the Quantum realm, I believe. Genesis says that we are created in the image and likeness of God. That likeness is not our hands and our feet but our consciousness.

One point that de Wesselow made his book the Sign was that in dealing with ancient works establishing the provenance meaning the origin and history is sometimes difficult, if not impossible. But let me use the Latin phrase “res ipsa loquitur” in context.\nThe facts speak for themselves. In this case the facts are the physical existence of the Shroud and their attributes and what those physical attributes demonstrate. When one looks at the sum of those attributes it is pretty hard not to reach the conclusion that it is the burial cloth of a horribly tortured and crucified man. From the circumstances it’s reasonable to conclude that man was Jesus Christ. The only important fact on the other side of the ledger is the carbon dating. Ray Rogers and others showed why that may be wrong and Ray Rogers came up with a “fact” that pseudo-skeptics seem to ignore. The complete absence of vanillin in the larges part of the Shroud indicating that it was at least 1500 years old, not 700 years. However, how many times impeached, the pseudo-skeptics push the carbon dating button. I use the phrase “pseudo”-skeptic, because they are not truly skeptics searching for truth. They are the truest believers, but their belief is atheism. Nothing that contradicts their view can be tolerated.\nSo in one context, whatever you might say about the history of the Shroud is almost irrelevant. Who cares? Maybe Caligula used it as a shower curtain? Maybe Simon the Magician stole it because he could sell it for a mint and then somebody else stole it back. Maybe it was abducted by aliens in a UFO and then returned because it wasn’t worth much in the market place of Polaris’third planet. Maybe it was worshipped by the Knights Templar or the Knights of Malta. Maybe the Popes used it as a bed sheet. \nWho cares? The physical facts of what is here and now are what we can rely on. All the rest, to paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, is commentary.\nIt’s provenance will always be in dispute for there can never be an conclusive path proven from the Tomb to Turin. But what fascinates me is its providence. The image on the Shroud while interesting and inspiring through medieval time to the present age of science could have taught very little until the advances of science in the past 115 years. And now, in this skeptical era science has caught up with the Shroud. The scientific study of the Shroud has become a revelation, rather a Revelation.\nIs it coincidental? Or was the image left there for discovery now? Is the issue provenance. or providence? Is it an accident, or the product of a consciousness beyond our understanding? Does it matter which is true (or both).\n\n","date":"May 31, 2012 at 9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/31/comment-promoted-ray-schneider-on-charles-freeman-sturp/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Comment Promoted: Ray Schneider on Charles Freeman & STURP"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Dan,\nI believe that based upon Colin’s long winded threat, you should rally reconsider whether Colin is an appropriate contributor to blog comment section.\nWhat he wants to do is post his drivel on his blog and then comment here but a critic mustn’t use his words posted on his blog or “ta da” a law suit.

Consciousness is central also to understanding, meaning and volitional choice with the experience of free will. Our views of reality, of the universe, of ourselves depend on consciousness. Consciousness defines our existence.”  (Emphasis added)\nTeilhard de Chardin defines the human species as the singular species which has a reflective consciousness. Not just that we are aware of our existence but that we are aware that we are aware. Sir Bertrand Russell was wrote that solipsism   – the belief that the only relevant existence is that we consciously perceive and thus create – is the only defensible philosophy.\nThere is a legendary anecdote that has been reported in different guises that a woman wrote him to express her gratitude for his enunciating his position because “I thought I was the only one ho believed that.”\nSolipsism is my opinion is the underlying explanation for Ayn Rand’s  Egoism and Friedrich Nietzsche’s nihilism. I fled from it. In my book “Quantum Christ” I defined God as the primordial consciousness from which our existence sprang. I do not retreat from the definition but now I think I can clarify it further: God is the primordial solipsist. He is the big box of consciousness into which all the little boxes of consciousness are contained and that includes each of us. \nSome years ago I read that quantum science was demonstrating that underlying our existence was the law of probability theory. Incidentally, Richard Dawkins agrees with that. I was aghast and so was Einstein before he died. But I asked myself a question: Whose law is the law of probability?\nI think I am challenged now to write this more explicitly.

There are 28 listed. Instead of attacking me why don’t you tackle the 28 and give us your rebuttal. I have problems with some of the 28 but by enlarge it is a nice encapsulation of many of the circumstances of the Shroud that point towards its authenticity.\nWell done, David.\n\n","date":"December 15, 2015 at 9:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/07/david-rolfes-website/","cat":"other_sites","title":"David Rolfe’s Website"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Hugh raises excellent questions.

From a set of observations, none of which conclusively proves something, we can draw a conclusion of another fact that the set of facts are consistent with and that with which any contrary conclusion is inconsistent.\nThe Spicer thesis ties together a great many other theories and speculations. It may be a thesis of that explains the “Kirlian aura” effect as a cause of the image. \n“An alternative but perhaps less likely theory is that the imprint resulted from a “Kirlian effect” or other unknown quality of Christ’s body; the aura of light and the rare condition of haematidrosis (bloody sweat) recorded of Christ may be cited in this regard.aura”  William Meacham, http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm.\nMeacham is an archaeologist who has written extensively about the Shroud and was an expert critic of the carbon dating (I am sure most readers of the blog will know who Bill Meacham is.)\nThe importance of the image is not the process of its creation which may not be “miraculous” as that term is normally used. It is what the image displays or doesn’t display. It doesn’t display evidence of putrefaction byproducts and does display evidence of rigor mortis.\nThe two are related. Rigor mortis is a freezing of the muscles into their configuration at the time of death or a short time afterwards. Putrefaction is a degeneration of body tissues and is evidenced by the exuding of chemicals that would be obviously present on a shroud and lead to pronounced degradation of a shroud. \nAlthough times for each may very, it is not a leap of logic to assume they are related. 48 hours in the normal course is reasonable time to expect thee onset of putrefaction and the release of rigor mortis.\nLet see. 48 hours from 3:00pm on a Friday is 3:00 PM on the following Sunday afternoon. If a body had remained enwrapped in the Shroud of Turin until 3:00PM Sunday and the image created at that time or later there would be in all probability no evidence of rigor mortis and some evidence of putrefaction. Numerous examinations of the Shroud image by expert forensic pathologists have found neither evidence of putrefaction nor the release of rigor mortis.\nScripture tells us that Mary Magdalene discovered the body of Christ missing early Sunday morning. That’s probably why approximately two billion of the world’s population celebrate that Sunday as Easter.\n\n","date":"October 26, 2015 at 7:39 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/26/dan-spicer-we-have-a-simple-explanation/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Dan Spicer:  We have a simple explanation."},{"author":"john_klotz","post":". It seems to me that some individuals are too comfortable with a science-faith dichotomy that they too easily reject the intrusion of one or another into the world view. Thus the Resurrection is an event not subject to scientific investigation and analysis because it can’t be repeated.\nAlmost every one on either side of the science-faith dichotomy recognizes now that the universe as we know it began with a “big bang.” Yet, it is not a repeatable event and our understanding of it is more an application of mathematics to physical observations. [If any one knows a scientist trying to replicate the Big Bang, please ask him to stop.] Now!!!\nJust as the creation of the universe was once a matter of faith and is now a matter of science even though we can’t repeat it, I would suggest that there are aspects of the Resurrection “theory” are examinable by scientific theory.\nIt begins with a form of matter (a body) that is transformed into something we do not yet have an explanation of other than through faith. But that transformation happened in the here and now and everything up to the moment of transformation is subject to scientific and historical analysis.\nThis of course brings us to the Shroud of Turin and its image which I believe gives circumstantial support to the Resurrection in that it was created before rigor mortis was released on the body and byproducts of putrefaction existed that would degrade the cloth. There is no question I believe that means that the body and the Shroud parted company. Circumstantially, the Resurrection is consistent with Shroud and the Shroud is inconsistent with almost any other hypothesis. \nI applaud the efforts of scientists like Jackson and his colleagues who are seeking an explanation of how the image was created. That the theories advance involve “natural” phenomena doesn’t detract one whit from the “miracle” that was the Resurrection just as the hypothesis of the Big Bang detracts from faith that at the core of our existence was a primordial consciousness from which our existence evolved. \nThe best creation story to me is the Gospel of St. John: “In the beginning was the word.”\n\n","date":"October 28, 2015 at 5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/10/26/dan-spicer-we-have-a-simple-explanation/","cat":"critical_summary","title":"Dan Spicer:  We have a simple explanation."},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Dan,\nThere was thing about the presentation of Jackson which I found really disconcerting. He claimed that it would take an enormous amount of “contamination” to have skewed the C-14 results. \nThe problem is that the critics of the C-14 tests address was not “contamination” but the presence of a rewoven linen and repairs. Contamination might an appropriate description of the bio-plastic coating theory but it simply does not apply to the work of Ray Rogers and virtually every other commentator since the landmark Benford-Marino report of 2000.\nRogers found  THAT THE LINEN in the are was NEW because of substantial differences with the linen in the body of the Shroud. Also, it was dyed UNLIKE the linen in the main body of the Shroud. The cotton was present because the linen didn’t hold the dye and the cotton is what gave the patch color.\nApparently Jackson had stepped out for coffee when Pam Moon of GB earlier gave an excellent presentation on new examinations of pictures of the underside of the Oxford sample that pretty conclusively demonstrated dramatic differences with the main body of the Shroud.\nWhat Jackson and the company want to do is throw the dice on a theory that will “prove” the Resurrection. There theory may even be correct. But to move that theory forward in a desperate attempt to “prove” the Resurrection is a fools errand.\nPerhaps I am being impolitic. But the search for truth is often impolitic. \nFrankly, Sunday morning’s highlight was the clash between Jack Markwardt and Dan Scavone about the early history of the Shroud. In case anyone wasn’t listening, Professor Scavone’s presentation which followed Markwardt’s had one item that seemed to verify Markwardt’s basic point: that an inventory of the Constantinople relics before 1204 listed  two different relics: a Sudarium and a Sindone.\nThat in no way is a critique of Professor Scavone who has been a lion in the study of Shroud history. The “debate” between Markwardt and Scavone is an honest one and mutually respectful. \nAnd OMG, Markwardt cited Charles Chapman.

I even blogged a piece in June 2011 which demonstrated its use and related it to the Shroud of Turin: THE SHROUD OF TURIN, THE RESURRECTION AND JOE KENNEDY,  http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2011/06/shroud-of-turin-resurrection-and-joe.html\nIt is more or less the heart of the first chapter of my book which deals with how we can reasonable draw conclusions from circumstantial evidence and as Dawkins notes we sometimes have to.\nIn sum, from two facts recited in the third verse of the lyrics written by Ira Gershwin, reasonable conclude, and I would submit beyond a reasonable doubt, that Gershwin was twitting Joseph Kennedy, the father of US President John Kennedy.\nThe two facts: (a) in 1929 I sold short and in (b) In England I am presented in Court.\nCutting to chase, I submit with 100% confidence that of tyhe over 100 billion huamns who have walked the face of the Earth since the human race emrged from evolution, nly one – Joseph P. Kennedy fits those two facts. I guess the odds that he is not would be 1 in a 100,000,000,000.\nObviously, the issue of Shroud authenticity is a much more complex issue. However, its an accumulation of facts, that lead inevitability to the conclusion that the Shroud is authentic. Some are quite strong and some are more weak. You can not reach a conclusion without taking into account the totality of the evidence. \nIt’s something that we do every day of our life. To quote the first sentence of my book: “We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nIn a UN debate back in the day, the USSR Ambassador twitted the UN Ambassador for retitevly quoting himself. And Goldberg hadn’t even written a book to quote from. :-)\nThere is a paper on the shroud.com which lists many of the circumstances which revealed by the physical facts of the Shroud:   http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/doclist.pdf\nIt lists 87 circumstances that the signers of the paper believed support  the authenticity of the Shroud which were empircally proven and 61 more confirmed findings that point in that direction. That’s 148 circumstances, none of which individually prove authenticity but taken as a whole prove it.

That science has revealed to us the meaning of the blood stains and the image at this pint in human history, is also … providential. \nWe are literally facing the possible, if not inevitable, apocalyptic extinction of the humanity. The engine of our extinction is the selfish abuse of the environment empowered by advances in science. Our survival now depends on extraordinary, unprecedented and perhaps impossible acts of individual and collective selflessness. Science whose inventions have brought us to the brink of extinction can, if properly harnessed, give us the tools to pull us back.\nWhat the Shroud teaches by example the power of love to conquer selfishness and death in even the most dire circumstances. Because the evolution that drove the development of our reflective consciousness was driven by selfishness it may very well have been necessary that God his/herself had to give the example of selfless love through the death and resurrection of Christ. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. \nNo simple human could have given the necessary example.\nThe real miracle and revelation is that Christ partakes of our human nature. One of the jotys of my life is to hear on Christmas eve a line of from O Holy night that may sum up the mystery and revelation of Christ for us all:\n“Long lay the world in sin and error pining;\ntill he appeared and the soul felt its worth.”\nIn an E-Mail today, John Jerpe had the following insight:\n“[T]he present state of the world is such that habitual warfare and weaponized technology increase the probability of something apocalyptic. If we already know that the human community might “self-destruct”, perhaps the Shroud (and the Man in it) are saying that there exists dormant within the human organism an energy source we have not even conceptualized yet, hence the image. i.e. Is the Man in the Shroud simply Jesus or is the man in the Shroud you and I?”\nThe Shroud matters not because Christ was God, it matters becasue it testifies and reveals that he was also human – just as you and I.\n\n","date":"May 21, 2015 at 10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/21/john-klotz-the-blind-men-the-elephant-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"John Klotz, the Blind men, the Elephant and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles,\nI appreciate the courtesy of your comment but I do not accept the concept that I am as likely as right as you are or visa versa. The first sentence of my book is “We do not order our lives by proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Nonetheless we do make decisions. \nI have spent my professional career dealing with proving and disproving things. When I graduated law school, I won an award for the best contribution by a senior student to the law review. It was a note on the evidentiary principle of res ipsa loquitur:  the facts speak for themselves. My principal point was that res ipsa was simply an application of the rules of circumstantial evidence.\nI appreciate the fact that it would be a bit of arrogance (if not simony) for me to insist that you buy by book. So here’s a freebee. The arguments about authenticity drawn from my book in the guise of a review of the CNN production of CNN’s Funding Jesus is available on the web at no cost at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/klotzcnn.pdf (I do not know if that TV program was available across the pond). Excuse my self-absorption if I cite that piece as “Klotz”).\nI will now give you a lecture (I’m not nearly as arrogant as I write) on the Shroud and circumstantial evidence citing four physical objects three of which are in physical existence today and one of which we have available only through a painting of it. The three which physically exist to day are (1) the Shroud of Turin; (Klotz p. 4), (2) The Pray Codex in Budapest Hungary. (Klotz p. 5) and (3) an illustration in the prayer book of Margaret of France (Klotz p. 3). The one which is not in existence but of which we have a painting is the Lier Shroud. (Klotz p. 5).\nThere is no question that three of them are artistic representations and one of them is NOT an artistic representation but actually has burn holes surrounded by a charred ring. (See illustration Klotz P. 4) It should be no surprise that the one with actual burn holes is the Shroud of Turin.\nTwo things of interest about the Lier Shroud. It was created before the fire in 1532 and does not therefore evidence the patches sewn on by the Poor Sister of St. Clare. Neither does the Pray Codex. \nHere’s the kicker in my view, the painting of the Lier Shroud shows the degrading of the burn holes from layer to layer. Neither the Pray Codex NOR  Margaret’s prayer book has that verisimilitude.\nI believe it was Colin Berry who refereed to the Pray Codex as “over-hyped.” I do not know what that means scientifically. It is what it is. Those who wish to denigrate it with elegant invective conveniently ignore the facts. In the upper left hand corner of the drawing is a figure with a cloth draped over his shoulder. It’s actually two illustrations. The top part is the burial of Jesus and it shows, inter alia, Joseph of Arimethea. The bottom part is an Angel announcing the Resurrection to the Mary Magdalene and the women who accompanied her. \nThe important point is the consistency of the burn hole configuration among all four items: the original Shroud and the three representations with the Lier Shroud actually showing variations of the holes through four layers.\nThe conclusion to be reached by this circumstantial evidence is I believe unassailable and actually reaches proof beyond reasonable doubt standards. The Shroud predates the time period allowed by the carbon dating.\nSo no, I do not believe that you are likely to be right under reasonable circumstances and it is not a 50-50 proposition.\n\n","date":"May 22, 2015 at 5:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/21/john-klotz-the-blind-men-the-elephant-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"John Klotz, the Blind men, the Elephant and the Shroud of Turin"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Fascinating story Louis.

The author argues that as Newtonian principles are useful for describing macroscopic reality, so Freud’s Newtonian constructs are useful to a certain depth of therapy. Beyond that point, scientific metaphors can be retained but the appropriate metaphors are those of quantum physics. Quantum metaphors are used to explore duality, free will and patient-therapist interaction.\nPMID: 2610648 [PubMed – indexed for MEDLINE”\nI believe some later works of Freud which predate the above journal abstract by sixty or so years, dabbled in the quantum but I note that in 1989 this author apparently ties Freud pretty close to Newton. Read your review. Quite interesting.\nHis use of the term “matter” for the soul would be a Newtonian construct not a Quantum one. But frankly, I’m not going there.\n\n","date":"March 23, 2014 at 5:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/23/john-klotz-from-his-upcoming-book/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"John Klotz from his upcoming book"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"I have a correction to make and I should have known better. In The Phenomenon of Man, Teilhard ditched the scholastic appearance/substance dichotomy language and substituted an inner/outer dichotomy which is essentially simply a refinement of the scholastic thought. However, in discussing the inner/outer of things the inner existence is consciousness. That is not an ephemeral, can’t be studied or proven theological construct. That is science and everything I wrote applies. This is something I wrote in the introduction to the manuscript: “Science attempting to explain human consciousness is science attempting to define what the religious call the soul.”\nI stand by that.

Whatever Colin’s credentials, and they may be impressive in his field, he is apparently using makeshift apparatus. Does he actually work in his kitchen? I thought I saw that once. John Brown worked in his dinning room, but he had one his advanced microscopes there.\nRay Rogers did not rely on his expertise and devices which far exceed what Colin has at his disposal. Moreover, he didn’t rely on his own findings and sought verification from others including John Brown and Robert Villarreal. Brown was a retired Principal Research Scientist at Georgia Tech Research Institute who had his own Scanning Electronic Microscope at his home. He reproduced pictures of fibers from the Raes patch at 3650X and 3300X magnification. You can look at them yourself, at this very instant. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf\nRobert(o) Villarreal reported on his results twice: once at the 2008 Ohio Conference http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm and again at the 2012 Valencia Conference http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf\nVillarreal was consulted by Rogers shortly before he died and he was given a sample thread by Rogers. But before he could any test Rogers passed away. He asked Roger’s wife Joan what he should do and she said she was too distraught to deal with it. He heard nothing more  until contacted by Barrie Schwortz who was de facto Rogers’ scientific executor. Barrie delivered to Villarreal, among other things, a sample thread from the carbon sample area which held back by Riggi and Gonella.\nThe thread samples Virreal  then  had were examined by:\n1. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy\n2. Tube Excited and Radioactive Source Micro-spot Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence\n(MXRF) Spectrometry\n3. High and Low Powered Magnification with a High Resolution Photo-Microscope\n4. Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) with Reflectance Mode Capability\n5. Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (TOF-SIMS)\nIn each one of those tests he was assisted by scientists from Los Alamos,\nBerry says “forget STURP, forget Rogers” on no other basis then his skepticism. He has never had in his possession a sample of any kind from the actual Shroud as Rogers, Brown, Villarreal and Schwortz did.\nPeople like to cite Occam’s Razor for various propositions, none of which actually originated with William of Okkam. Let me put it this way. Fraud and Falsehood are usually more complex than the truth. Unless you have grounds to believe that Ray Rogers, Sue Benford, Joe Marino, John Brown,. Robert Villarreal and Barrie Schwortz  were participating in a fraud that scanned 14 years (from Orvieto to Valencia) you have no basis to ignore their results as Berry does.\nFrankly, I am reminded of Christ’s retort to Mary and Joseph when as a boy, he had abandoned them to discuss scripture with the elders of the Temple: “Do you not know I must be about my father’s business.” His Father is also our Father. In studying the shroud, we are about His business. We can not, as I am once again, allow Berry to distract us from His business with a whistling tea pot. There is too much real science to do. \nI will not respond to Colin should he comment. I must be about the Father’s business which in my case includes finishing my manuscript.\n\n","date":"November 2, 2013 at 6:02 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/02/consider-rogers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Consider Rogers"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Hugh,\nCharles Freeman has painted with a broad brush in deciding the Shroud research attracts  “evil, insincere, deceitful,etc,” individuals.

I do believe your appraisal of McCrone is simply wrong and I am at loss to find substantiation for it other than the rhetoric of individuals who are desperate to prove the Shroud unauthentic.

Your statement which is of course libelous per se on this side of the Atlantic had you named just one living person who was “evil, insincere, deceitful,etc”  Such a personal attack is totally unwarranted by any facts you have stated. One thing I have stated about Heller is that he had “soul.” In an  inner US city, that is the highest of praise. \nI guess I’m a little partial to the term since at one time in my career, I was representing Latino insurgents against the corrupt Bronx political machine in the South Bronx. After one argument in court, an African-American Council member who was also a minister remarked to an acquaintance: “I never knew Klotz had soul.” I have had a number of compliments in my career but I was touched by that one. Of course primo uno compliment came from the presiding judge of the New York State Court who introduced to me to “his attorney” as “one the ten best lawyers in Manhattan.” That was probably hyperbole, but the my “soul” compliment about Heller is a measure of my esteem for the late John Heller.\nIf you have truly read Heller’s book, and not come away with personal admiration, if not for his book than the man, you are surely in sorry state.\nI am spent too much time on this blog this weekend.

Whatever your infatuation with Walter McCrone, for years he used is “debunking” of the Yale Vinland map as a credential. It was one of the things that impressed STURP members early on. Gove in his memoir after discussing the Shroud with McCrone in 1977-78, concluded he was seeking to polish his credentials withe proving the Shroud a fake.\nYou may may feel John Heller an unreliable witness or scientist, you sight one individual and rush to the 1973 test which Heller found to be unreliable.  I believe Heller to be a very credible scientist. Gove’s dish of Heller in his memoir would be laighable if it were not, I will use the word “dishonest.” Also, the earliest work on the Shroud by STURP scientists before there was even a formal STURP revealed a lack of “directionality ” in the image. Also the image is finer than any known paint brush (cf Heller again). McCrone frantically came up with various theories  and theories about it being a painting, but none of them flew. And eventually his findings on the Vinand map were challenged.\nHere’s were you have an near insurmountable problem: the Shroud is not a work of art. As far as the Byzantine is concerned (depending on how you define Byzantine, Paul Vidnon who was among the first scientific-scholars to report on the Pia photos also rejected it as a work of art. Vignon was also an accomplished artist.\nLater, he published a book at the start of of World War II that examined in great detail the relationship of the image of the Shroud to what I assume you mean by Byzantine. Vignon’s book was an elaborate expensive production and was never translated into English. I was privileged to examine a copy at the NY Public Library., two years ago. However Vignon’s work was first noticed by Walsh and then popularized by Ian Wilson and his examination of the Vignon markings has been quite sophisticated. Not all the markings are representive in each piece of Byzantine art and some are included and some not in various places. \nAbout the history of art you might have something to contribute. However, with all due respect, you have a habit of trashing those who reach conclusions different than yours. i.e. Thomas de Wesellow. For some reason you review of his book “The Sign” had disappeared from the Amazon page on the The Sign. Am I correct on that? My last attempt to find it was unsuccessful. Perhaps I didn’t go deep enough.\nIf you can as an art historian identify the school or tradition from which the Shroud image might have come, it might be helpful. In From Christ to Coke, Martin Kemp attempted to do a cursory examination and I would submit failed miserably. But that’s my opinion and I shall address it later. Kemp, when not being cursory, is in fact an excellent art historian and his work as an appraiser can involve some deep science. No so in the case of his Shroud appraisal. I will write about that in my manuscript.\nNow I have  to get to court.

It is the most authoritative work on STURP written and Heller was a gifted writer. He was not at the 120 hours of Turin but he became a part of STURP a two months before they departed for Rome and in the ensuing three years labored mightily to resolve the issues of the the blood stains He did the blood work on  the samples Rogers took that  were temporarily absconded by Walter McCrone. Adler was brought into STURP by Heller. Heller, as I have mentioned from time to time was a Yale graduate who in his undergraduate days was chosen by Yale to be advised by Einstein at Princeton. He tries to modestly brush it off as a fluke bit it was hardly that.\nThe best summation of STURP and what it did and frankly a measure of Heller’s soul  is what I quote at length and call his Valedictory:\n“The images are the result of dehydrative acid oxidation of the linen. The blood is human blood. How the images got on the cloth is a mystery. We would love to have the answer to this mystery, to explain the science of .it.  If it turns out that some form of molecular transport we have not been able to fathom is a method whereby the images of the scourge, crucified man were transferred to the linen, we shall have solved only another little micro part of the puzzle.\n“We do know, however, that there are thousands upon thousands of pieces of funerary linen going back two millennia before Christ and another huge number of linens of Coptic Christian burials. On none of these is there any image of any kind. A few have some blood and stains on them, but no image.\n“However, there are some remarkable aspects to this voyage of discovery. The team itself – its formation, cohesion, diversity, collaboration, as well as his sacrifice of time, talent and treasure – is unique in scientific annals.\n“The role of “coincidence” is awesome.\n“Science undertook its specialty, which is measurement. We were supremely confident that the answers would – indeed must – be forthcoming. And we fail.\n“Many team members were ordered or threatened to desist from the project, yet they persevere. Though it was believed that there would be a confrontation between science and religion, none occurred. Rather the relationship was harmonious and synergistic.\n“All of us have been changed by the project. I believe we have grown.\n“Some years ago, a friend of mine said to me in exasperation, ‘Heller, why don’t you spend less time in Athens and more in Jerusalem?’\n“I find the Acropolis much less interesting these days.”\nDr. John H.

If are are a serious critic of STURP or a serious proponent of their findings, you MUST read Heller’s book to get a real grasp of what happened as well as the interplay of what happened. For example, Heller was quite critical of McCrone and essentially said that he tied to steal Rogers’ samples. He was supposed to look at them, make his findings and then forward them to Heller. He didn’t do that. He sent him three slides and kept the rest. Jackson and Rogers had to go to Chicago and physically retrieve them. He also was sloppy in his handling. The most appropriate critique of Heller’s work might be that McCrone had messed-up the samples – except that Heller and Adler were able to work around that klutz McCrone’s mess. :-)\nAnd incidentally, in Grove’s memoir he indicates  that McCrone was out to prove the Shroud a fake from the get go. He had “proven” Yale’s Vinland Map a fake and he wanted to add the Shroud’s scalp to his belt.\n\n","date":"November 3, 2013 at 7:27 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/02/consider-rogers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Consider Rogers"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Grove = Gove\n\n","date":"November 3, 2013 at 7:29 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/02/consider-rogers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Consider Rogers"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Hugh, if you have read Heller’s book and Gove’s  memoir and really believe in McCrone’s sincerity, then there are a couple bridges,you might be interested in investing.

That is very strong language but there comes when there are competing versions of the truth totally at odds, you must either make a judgment of confess you just don’t know. The scientific evidence that the Shroud is not a painting is conclusive – beyond a reasonable doubt. And I don’t say that about everything involving the Shroud.

They were to love God with our whole being and to love our neighbor as ourselves. \nThat’s it. But what does it mean to love both God and neighbor? How does one “love” a disembodied spirit existing before space and time and beyond our comprehension. Christ nswered that question in the parable of the Last Judgment.

No where is tithing raised as a necessary deed, nor even honoring the Sabbath. Rather only through the works of love to the neediest CAN we express our  love of the deity.\nPope Francis realizes this. That’s why he saw Jesus in the person of a young Moslem delinquent girl whose feet he washed during his first Holy Week as pope.\nMother Theresa found Christ in the desperate neediest in the slums of Calcutta. \nIt a real test to love the neediest, particularly if he or she is a homeless person on the subway who hasn’t bathed in a while and who, frankly, smells awful.\nBut that’s what Christianity is about.

That means I sometimes find myself in coalition with individuals who have different world views than mine, sometimes very profoundly different views (i.e. really old Left). My politics come from a dissertation by a man named Matthew which is a part of the book called the New Testament.\nYet, even with people I may profoundly disagree with, I have made common cause on issues we agree on: Merit selection of judges, not invading Iraq, women’s rights, nuclear disarmament.

Ultimately they are far more important for the human condition than any of the others I have worked on or written about, and possibly, you and I would have disagreement. But I am sure you agree with me on these two: The Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ and that it offers some proof of his Resurrection. \nThere is another recent book touching on the Shroud by an art historian (this time an Oxonian) Martin Kemp: “From Christ to Coke.” In it Kemp recognized the power of the Christ icon and notes the strange transformation that occurred circa 300 CE when in changed from curly haired Roman or Greek to the Pantocrator.

If you believe that Christ had a consciousness that was a reflection of the primordial consciousness, than, as I said, what’s the big deal with the Resurrection?\nhttp:/./johnklotz.blogspot.com\n\n","date":"August 11, 2012 at 7:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/11/yannick-clments-summa-theologica/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Yannick Clément’s Summa Theologica"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"I thought the appropriate verb was “clean.”\n\n","date":"June 12, 2015 at 4:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist"}],"resources":[{"author":"john_klotz","post":"This is a season to celebrate the Birth of Chhrist. Perhaps the sour pusses could stop sucking on heir lemons and rejoice.\nHow far Pope John can go is an interesting question. He made some remarkable appointments and non-appointments in the past few days which auger well in my opinion.\nThere have been many interesting incidents that give an insight into this Pope’s soul. One the most interesting was that he personally contacted a an unwed woman carrying the child of her married lover (he apparently had concealed his marriage.) One of the woman’s concerns was that since she wasn’t married, her child would not be baptized. Pope Francis comforted the woman by  by promising to baptize the child himself. \nThe other day out of curiosity I checked the church bulletin at my local parish. Sure enough, when it talked about ground rules for baptizing an infant it required a review of the parent(s)’ and God Parent(s) appropriateness.\nThe there is the issue of communion which some prelate’s in the US have  been threatening to deny to recalcitrant  politicians who did not toe the Church’s mark on a number of issues including gay marriage, contraception and abortion. Francis has said words to the effect that we need communion to nourish us because we are all sinners.\nHos recent appointments give us solid indication about his attitude towards the right wing ideologues who have recently controlled the US Catholic Bishop’s Conference.

I think mine may be closer to that of Pope Francis.\nSome years ago, I pondered a solution to the multiple religions quandary that actually echoed something Bobby Kennedy suggested to his brother and his other advisers dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Khrushchev (like Kennedy) was dealing with a bellicose faction in  the military and he sent two messages in near rapid succession. One was quite temperate and promising. The second was bellicose and threatening seeming to shut the door, Bobby’s proposal was to ignore the second message and respond to the first. (There were numerous other factors including a not widely publicized intervention by Pope John XXIII)\nIt worked.\nWhat I think the Pope should do, and I think what Pope Francis has effectively been doing is recognize that all those parts of humanity whatever their formal religion are de facto Christians and a part of his flock. His obligation is to all of humanity, not just baptized Catholics.\nWhen I was a child (and even a teenager) I was taught that the hallmarks of the true church was that it be One, Holy, Catholic [universal] and Apostolic. By asserting the moral authority of the Christian Gospel and finding common cause with multiple religious leaders Francis is creating a framework for a truly Catholic Church. \nHis essential message becomes you are all Catholics and  I am the pope of all. Kind of like the Kennedy’s ignoring the bombast of the second message and concentrating on the first.\nWhen we surrender to love, we belong to a universal church whether we want to admit it or not. All of the scriptures and the prophets resolve to this: love. Don’t argue with me, that is what He said. (capital H not a typo!)

Although I don’t intend to do much with the concept right now, Hugh’s initial skepticism that I could construct (with tutelage) a tesseract at age 17 drew my attention to the tesseract: a three dimension representation of a four dimensional cube, the fourth dimension being time.\nYou have in the tomb Christ’s body one instant and in another instant it’s gone.

Try klotzlaw@gmail.com\nAs for your comment, I guess I am a “Chardinist” or “Teilhardist” (whichever) when it comes to science and religion. The fact that many scientist adopt “an argument from incredulity” as to Christ and the Resurrection,doesn’t change the fact that science itself is a search for truth and has made amazing progress in unraveling the mysteries of existence. It is now knocking on the door of the mystery of consciousness. It can’t be ignored or pigeon holed. \nThat is why I find the work of Hameroff so interesting. Again, I recommend a brief video of him:\n\nFor primitive man, anything inexplicable ended up as part of his religion. Thus the volcano was a god, the stars and planets were gods and everything that happened inexplicably was a visitation from god. As human knowledge expanded, the province of the gods shrunk. Now science is knocking on the door of ultimate issues.\nSome theologians and some science seek to avoid what Teilhard knew was an eventual merger of science into religion. You can’t avoid the science that is exploring the seminal issues of existence.\nThe first physicist to propound a theory of the “Big Bang” creation of the universe was a Belgian priest-scholar. He did it my simply taking the calculations that demonstrated an expanding, rather than a static universe and reverse them to an ultimate point where the Universe emerges with a “Big Bang” from nothingness, or what I prefer to call cosmic chaos. (That word may a-have a scientific definition of a state other than the one I prefer.)\nBut just as Galileo’s telescope first revealed the magnificent beauty and order of creation, science as to grapples withe the quantum and what lies beyond, is creating a “te deum” of its own.\nOf course many scientists are agnostic and atheistic, that’s their problem. In some recess of their minds they are apostles  of Nietzsche who propounded that “God is Dead.”\nSpoiler alert: That’s where I am heading with this chapter, the Apocalypse of Selfishness. We have institutionalized selfishness and besides Nietzsche, among the apostles of the Antichrist are Ayn Rand and the Austrian School of Economics. Those apostles are the subject Pope Francis withering  disdain. \nThat’s some agenda I have set for myself, I have already accumulated well over 100 items in my Apocalypse research folder (digitized).

The piece was written in 1971-1972 before the environmental community began to focus on “climate change”. Oil was a big source of pollution then as it is today. Alas, pollution seems to be small potatoes compared to climate change. \nHow does climate change connect to the Shroud? I give you the introduction to Chapter 17.\nThe Apocalypse of Selfishness: The Great “So What?”\n “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather for the sky is red.’ And in the morning, ‘There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and lowering.’ You know then how to discern the face of the sky, and can you not know the signs of the times?”\nMatthew 16:2-4\nIt is my premise  that the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus, called Christ, and that it offers evidence that supports the claim of his resurrection within three days of his crucifixion. The scientific examination of the Shroud began with the Secondo Pia photographs in 1898. Until then,  the facts concerning the death and purported Resurrection were essentially matters of faith drawing on the four Gospels accounts, the Epistles of Christ’s apostles and oral traditions of cloudy provenance. There were even those who claimed that Christ never existed at all. Science has now provided a rock of fact to which believers may cling. But so what?\nHere’s what: Humanity now faces an apocalyptical extinction as a species. Revelations and other apocalyptical writings have been until now mystical allegories and metaphors. But science is not prophesying in metaphors or allegories –  its prophecies of doom are based on hard facts.\nThe Apocalypse that threatens us is an apocalypse of selfishness. The heedless exploitation of our environment has resulted in multiple crises that demand immediate, concerted international cooperation and action, but the very apostles of selfishness that are driving humanity to the brink of extinction bar our way.\nFor prophecy of an apocalypse, let us turn to the current Roman Catholic Pope.\n“Small yet strong in the love of God, like Saint Francis of Assisi, all of us, as Christians, are called to watch over and protect the fragile world in which we live, and all its peoples.\nPope Francis\n¶216 Evangelii Gaudium\nDespite some criticisms from conservative elements in the Church, Francis has not retreated from his elevation of the environment to a religious issue.

Not by his philosophy but his insight. Nietzsche was primarily a late 19th century writer but I felt that the news of God’s death arrived with a bang in WWI and the reverberations of that echo still.\nHowever, philosophically, Nietzsche’s  philosophy of the superman beyond morality never became a part of my thinking.\nStrauss wrote a piece inspired by Nietzsche entitled “Thus Spake Zarathusta (auf Englshe).

Psychological and sociological studies have revealed deeply ingrained human traits; many shaped by our evolutionary history as a “here and now” species, that prevent us from acting rationally in the face of threats with long time scales, dispersed impacts and inherent complexity.

Elaine Pagels, hardly a Vatican favorite, concluded that the example set by the Christian martyrs was in fact a key to orthodox Christianity’s ascendancy over its gnostic competitors.\n“No doubt the persecutions terrified many into avoiding contact with Christians, but Justin and Tertullian both say that the sight of martyrs aroused the wonder and admiration that impelled them to investigate the movement, and then to join it. And both attest that this happened to many others. (As Justin remarked: “The more such things happen, the more do others, in larger numbers, become believers.”) Tertullian writes in defiance to Scapula, the proconsul of Carthage: ‘Your cruelty is our glory … All who witness the noble patience of [the martyrs], are struck with misgivings, are inflamed with desire to examine the situation … and as soon as they come to know the truth, they immediately enroll themselves as its disciples.’[i]”\nPagels then puts martyrdom in the context of Christ’s life in words that echo Pasternak:\n“In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.”[ii]\n.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2015 at 7:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/the-imams-who-came-to-see-the-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Imams Who Came to See the Shroud"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Perhaps it’s just me, but I do not recall any other period time with the exception of 1978 (maybe) when the Shroud was infiltrating the public consciousness to such a degree..

Barrie can speak for himself but the facts, as he reported in the BSTS Journal and other places  are that as a Jew (whether observant or not) he was reluctant to get involved with a “Christian” relic. One colleague, who was also Jewish (Don Devan) convinced him that because they were Jewish and had no one would expect  them to have a bias toward authenticity. \n“So at Don’s [Devan’s] suggestion, I became a member of the STURP team, but I didn’t feel very comfortable about it. In fact, a few months into the project, I remember jokingly saying to Don Lynn at one of our many meetings, ‘”What’s a nice Jewish boy like me doing on a Christian Project like this?’\n“Don smiled and answered that perhaps I had forgotten that ‘the Man in question was also a Jew.’\n“’No, I knew that,’ I stated. So then Don gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever been given. He said, ‘God doesn’t tell us in advance what the plan is. Go to Turin and do the best job you can. Someday, you’ll know why.’ His words kept me on the team at that time when I was seriously considering quitting. And to make a long story short, he certainly was right!”\nBarrie’s lingering doubt was the issue of the blood evidence and its bright color. An explanation offered in a discussion with Al Adler in the 1990’s finally resolved that issue. In 1995, a friend called him told that the friend and his wife had seen a headline in a sensationalist magazine sold at supermarket checkout counters that revealed that the Shroud was “a photograph” created by Leonardo DaVinci.”  Schwortz decided that the resources, including his own photographs of the 1978 STURP examination which he had shared with numerous authors, needed a wider audience. He made a note in a file folder sitting on his desk: “Consider building a website.” A short time later he had a conversation with Don Lynn and reminded him of the advice he had received: :\n“Years ago, when you told me that someday I would know why I was on the Shroud team, well, you were right. I’ve finally figured it out and it only took eighteen years!”\nThere are a lot of things the press has gotten wrong about the Shroud at various times. Don’t be too hard on a reporter for a little hyperbole because the essence of what he was reporting is true: Barrie approached the Shroud as a skeptic and had lingering doubts  of authenticity for many years after. He was also a skeptic of the carbon dating because on thing h did know from the STURP examination: the Shroud was not a painting. \nI certainly hope the pseudo-skeptics who sometimes populate this blog don’t use your post as an excuse to launch any attack on Barrie or the press.\nBy the way, all of this is covered in detail my book Quantum Christ:  Chapter 11: “The Return of Ray Rogers.” See http://johnklotz.blogspot.com for details.\n\n","date":"February 19, 2015 at 7:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/19/windsor-star-story-on-upcoming-shroud-of-turin-exhibition/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Windsor Star Story on Upcoming Shroud of Turin Exhibition"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Doggone  it, I just spent $14 on a hoax because when it comes to the Shroud of Turin, that’s what “Hoax” is, a hoax.

The Shroud and the common facts among the four Gospel accounts of the Crucifixion complement and reinforce each other. \nI won’t bother to refute McCone, Shroud.com and shroudstory.com contain ample rebuttal.

I had not limited my inquiry to representations of  Christ. This image is unique, It’s existence is quite fragile because of the fact that it is among other things it is simply a discoloration of a either the outer cell wall of a fibrile or according to Rogers may be the discoloration not of the linen fibriles but of a containment left over from the retting process.\nRogers had an advantage because he had access to actual fibers from the linen. He was a chemist with impeccable credentials. Ultimately in his book he conceded he did not have the answer as to the actual formation process.\nI have a sincere hope that advances in mutilspectral digital analysis may provide some more definitive answers as to the nature of image and its relationship to the Shroud, The Vatican will have to get off the dime on this. That’s a challenge Pope Francis faces.\nI will also venture into Charles area of expertise with an amateurish proposition: If there is a convention it must have started somewhere. There had to be an original object that caught artist’ attention had then was adopted by them.\nThe Shroud was, as far as we know, not created by an artist. Yet, there were clearly paintings of a images on large pieces of cloth that appeared in Medieval times which mimic the Shroud.\nWithout getting into a debate about this because I must get Chapter 18 written,and the manuscript concluded there are more than three authors who have written extensively about the uniqueness of the Shroud image: Paul Vignon,  Ian Wilson and Thomas deWesselow. The various representations of the Shroud which incorporate unique aspects of the image of the Shroud were clearly paintings and drawings. Many of them disappeared in the bonfires of the French Revolution.\nThe  Shroud didn’t and the fact it didn’t is a first blush a stroke of good luck. I am not a fan of those who believe that everything in life is “God’s will” or divine  providence. I remember from my High School religious instruction the following: If you build a house on a flood plain and a flood comes and sweeps it away, that’s not divine providence, it’s human stupidity.\nHumanity has in effect built its house on a flood plain and the flood is coming. It’s climate change and we are threatened literally with extinction. That extinction if it comes will be the result of millions of selfish decisions made in the course of the Industrial Revolution. It is a “tragedy of the commons.”\nThe proposition to mull over is the same as I learned more than 50 years ago: the Sixth Extinction is not  divine providence it’s human selfishness. \nThe survival of the Shroud to this time and place and the reintroduction of Christ into the discourse through the science of the Shroud may not be blind luck but Divine Providence. Without the advances the Science, the Shroud would  be what Calvin and others claimed it to be: an evil superstition promulgated by an evil Vatican. \nBut science  is telling us, it is not that at all.\n\n","date":"July 27, 2014 at 6:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/26/john-klotz-issues-a-challenge-show-me-an-image/","cat":"books","title":"John Klotz Issues a Challenge:  Show Me an Image"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles,\nYou are foundering.

Nothing could be more “spiritual” than out of body experiences (OBE) or near death experiences (NDE). Yet  Hameroff has postulated a “physical” quantum explanation that would also apply to immorality. That doesn’t mean there is no immortality or OBE or NDE. It means that these phenomena can be explained scientifically. And that doesn’t make us all atheists either. It gives fresh meaning to the old hymn: How Great thou Art.\nI find that exciting. As I point out in material which I do not think I have posted and will not if I haven’t because it’s a crucial part of the manuscript,  Teilhard’s construction of the inner and outer aspects of existent objects has it’s root in   scholastic philosophy which had echoes of Plato. \nBut it is not philosophy, it is,, as Teilhard, insisted, science.  All of these philosophical distinctions that allow philosophers to mask the hard facts of reality are melting away in the face of quantum phenomena.\nThe quantum is a mystery, but if you don’t know quantum is a physical phenomenon  – even if it is subject to consciousness – you don’t know jack. Consciousness becomes the ultimate physical phenomenon.\nAnd there I go again, back to God has being the primodial consciousness.

How’s that for gibberish jargon except its not. Science is intruding on religion and millennia  of philosophical musings and constructs are headed for the dust bin of history. Please don’t bother me or the rest of civilization with Cartesian constructs. They no ,longer apply.\nWhat I have essentially read so far are philosophical objections and not scientific ones. Teilhard foresaw a convergence of science and religion..I don’t see evidence of that in the comments.\nA classmate of mine from high school, last year (who is a retired but active emeritus professor with a PhD in Physics from Carnegie – Mellon)  directed me to a video of Stuart Hameroff discussing the operation of the brain in term of quantum “action at a distance” or entanglement. When quantum entanglement first appeared, Einstein, arguably the greatest mind of the twentieth century, called in “spooky” and at first rejected it.\nQuantum mechanics is to the mind captured in a Newtonian net is weird. But it’s not a philosophy, it’s science..The existence of the Shroud is not a philosophical construct, it’s as physical reality as real  as Pike’s Peak. Science has told us how Pike’s Peak came to be.\nThere is an enduring mystery of how the Shroud image came to be. Science is not ready to solve that mystery yet. It will probably not be solved in my lifetime. But you younger guys and gals write this down. This is my prophecy: when the problem of the image formation is solved, Science will be staring the Resurrection (note the capital “R”) in the face.\nDavid R. I’ll make a challenge to you. Forget your personally designed IQ test. Find an impartial authority and we compete in an IQ test. When I was 11 years old I had an extraordinary result in an individual test at Syracuse U. When a professor called my mother to explain the results he didn’t give the real number. When my mother said my oldest brother (five boys in the family) had an IQ of 130, he replied, “Oh he (moi) is much higher than that. In my mid-forties, enduring a typical crisis of confidence, I took the Mensa test. I passed. That meant at least the 98%. There is no such thing as the 100 percentile. 98% is a genius level, is it not? If not it’s still pretty good for an old man of 40.  (When I took it)\nI really hate to go there because if I’m so smart, why ain’t I rich?\nSome years ago, I ran in a Democratic primary for District Attorney of the Bronx. Initially, I am  informed I had the highest Q rating. of the five contestants. That measures public favorabilty of name recognition, essentially. However, that faded. It would have taken a half a million dollars (which two opponents had) and my funds never hit more than mid-five figures\nA very well known influential politician who should of supported me didn’t. When he was asked by one of his contributors to do so, he snapped: “John Klotz only does what John Klotz wants to do.” When it was reported back to me, the hackles on my neck rose temporarily, but  any anger subsided. “Put it on my tombstone,”  I thought “He only did what he wanted to do.” \nThat particularly  politician brushed me off publicly as a “courageous gadfly.”: He meant it as a put down. I thought of Plato:(Socrates?) \n“I am that gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long …arousing and persuading and reproaching…You will not easily find another like me.”\nIncidentally, we are now on good terms. It’s like nothing ever happened.\nMy next Chapter after I finish this one will be “Apocalypse Now.” It’s theme will be that anti-Christ selfishness is on the verge of destroying humanity. That, by the way is a purely scientific argument. \nI do have a metaphorical anti-Christ in mind. It’s called the Austrian School of Economics. It is the  the system which led to the Michael Douglas quote in Wall Street,, “Greed is Good.” It’s not.. Don’t trust me, read the Gospel of Matthew. Or maybe the National Geographic or yesterday’s New York Times about Bangladesh..( I mean Sunday, March 30th.)\nI appreciate constructive comments.  Try my blog. Of course, it’s monitored. I once had someone stalking me on the web. He included comments like my relatives all burning in Hell. Or my oldest brother being a racist because I quoted one of his comments about JFK in WWII not being a hero. “The only thing he ever did is get his PT boat run over by a J*p destroyer.” By the way, JFK was a hero of mine. http://www.johnklotz.com/new-jfk.htm\nYou can see all of my previous publications at http://www.johnklotz.com/publish.htm \nI once won an Honorable Mention from the NYS Press Association for in-depth reporting. and was a contributing editor to the now defunct “Eastside Express.”  The article I won the award for revealed judicial misconduct and led to the discipline of five judges.\nMy personal favorite site is: Danny Boy, a Rememberance\n http://www.johnklotz.com/billy.htm\nDid I ever tell you that my brother Ray coined the phrase “muti-taslking.” Honest.

I got it through Amazon. In 1902, more than  three decades before he published his “Vignon Markings” he compared medieval depictions of Christ and found them inferior to the Shroud image and quite different.\nI was originally attracted to Christ to Coke because its author Martin Kemp was the leading art historian backing the DaVinci origination of what he dubbed “La Principessa” an art scandal par excellence when Christie evaluated a 100 million dollar drawing for $17,000 and sold it on consignment. See National Geographic Feb 2012, p. 101\nKudos to Martin Kemp for “La Principessa.” Really! Bronx cheer for “Christ to Coke!!” \nHis opinion is ignorant and a disgrace for an expert. I say “ignorant” because he obviously didn’t do his homework on the Shroud. He cites Pantocrator as the ultimate Christ icon and ignores or does not know about the well publicized Vignon markings linking to the Shroud image to the Pantocrator. He is dismissive of Ian Wilson’s “Mandylion theory,” and list Wilson’s latest book as “Reading” as well as the entire Shroud.com cite.(Kindle Edition location 1005). He ignores the Vignon markings even though they are discussed in the book he lists as “Reading.” (Kemp, Martin [2011-10-13]. Christ to Coke : How Image Becomes Icon, Figure 26, Kindle Edition location 2680)\nAnd he sort of grouses about the carbon dating controversy and then swallows it whole hog. His attribution of it to the Medieval/Renaisance times as a painting by an unknown Italian or French artists is – GIVEN THE EVIDENCE – absurd. \n“If I were asked to provide an art-historical date for the portrayal of Christ on the Shroud, I would estimate it have been made in the later thirteenth or first half of the fourteenth century in Italy or southern France. This is consistent with the much denigrated carbon dating.” (Kemp: Kindle Locations 954-956). \nIt is not a painting. If anything, what Barrie Schwortz has estimated to be more than a quarter of a million hours of Shroud research has demonstrated that.\nHowever, I have a working theory or an opinion about Mr. Kemp’s astute blindness. One of the bases of his LaPrincipessa opinion is carbon dating that was done on its vellum which dated it to DaVinci’s time. Is it possible that Oxford Don Kemp used Oxford’s very own carbon dating lab to do the dating? If so, is his attack on the Shroud authenticity occasioned by a necessity to, at least indirectly, defend the Oxford carbon dating lab?\nPerhaps the good Professor could enlighten us on who did his carbon dating? Just asking. Were we in court and he was testifying as an expert on the Shroud, it would be an admissible question on cross-examination. It’s called bias.\n.\n\n","date":"March 16, 2012 at 8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/new-book-christ-to-coke/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: Christ to Coke"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Couldn’t agree more.\n\n","date":"October 3, 2014 at 9:26 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/02/new-book-the-coming-of-the-quantum-christ/","cat":"books","title":"New Book:  The Coming of the Quantum Christ:"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Not on my “buy now” list.\n\n","date":"April 26, 2012 at 7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/new-book-stone-and-dung-oil-and-spit/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: Stone and Dung, Oil and Spit"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Secrets have been threatening to destroy the Vatican for centuries if not a millenia and a half.

I guess the problem is the literal translation of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments. I wonder if either of the writers read Genesis literally. Pope Benedict certainly doesn’t. It’s not history, it is metaphor or allegory but we have much to learn from Genesis.\nFour thousand years ago religion explained everything from the blowing of the wind to the flicker of the fire. The first scientists were the ancient priests. Science and religion sprang form the same soil. We have earned many things in the ensuing millennia and many things that were religion are now science. Now science is nibbling at what would seem to be purely religious questions:  most importantly the nature of consciousness and the soul.\nIf you believe in God as creator, then He must have left fingerprints. Certainly the Shroud is such a fingerprint. But the quantum level of existence is something more: it is an interface and its seeming irrationality I believe is evidence that at the quantum level we are just one step removed from that consciousness from which all existence has proceeded and to which all shall return. Ultimately all of the law and all of the prophets resolve to one word and concept: love. What is exciting to me is how at the quantum level some see love not as an abstraction but a reality.\nWhen Galileo demonstrated the folly of Ptolemy, he was nearly burned at the stake and had to recant the truth.\nIt was Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in the Phenomenon of Man who wrote of a synthesis of Science and Religion, something the militant atheists like Dawkins would ultimately reject. But in the scientific study of the Shroud that is what we are doing. If that study demonstrates support for the Resurrection, is that bad?\nIf you truly believe in Christ, do not fear science. I believe that in this skeptical age the Shroud is a “game changer.” Is it perhaps Divine Providence that just when science is knocking on the door of the ultimate issues of existence, science is also proving the reality and vitality of Christ: crucified and Resurrected?\n\n","date":"December 31, 2011 at 8:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/29/the-coming-of-the-quantum-christ/","cat":"books","title":"The Coming of the Quantum Christ"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Thanks for your comments.

Although I think Occam’s Razor is much over used, I have suddenly found my self resorting to it. There ares several permutations of it.\nBasically I beleive the most sophisticated form is that the solution that requires to the fewest assumptions is more likely the correct one. But it is rephrased. In the military there developed the KISS principle which has two variation depending if you use a comma. It can be “Keep it simple,  stupid.” (with a comma) which calls the addressee stupid. Or it can be without a comma: “Keep it simple stupid” which means that the ultimate in simplicity  should be “simple stupid.”  [understandable by even stupid people].\nI have found the work of Daryl Domning very intriguing. There is an article of his available on the web site of the Jesuit web site of the Jesuit web site America: See Evolution, Evil and Original Sin” America,  Vol. 185 No. 15 (November 12, 2001)\nHe also wrote a book with  colleague, the late Monka K. Helwig:., “Original Selfishness: Original Sin and Evil in the Light of Evolution” (Ashgate, 2006); \nThe issue is whether selfishness was one of the driving forces of evolution. Start there. It’s a simple, but not too simple, proposition. \nNow I appreciate there  are theologians who do not like simple propositions and wander-off into complex constructs that have little relationship to how we actually live our lives. I believe that in  the Great Commandment(s) and the Last Judgment,  Christ made it very simple. In fact he kind of applies Occam’s Razor when he explains the dual commands to love God and Love neighbor and then he says “On these two commandments depend the the whole  law and the prophets.”\nI note that some modern translations have changed the last line. But I like my Confraternity Edition which cost me $1 as a Freshman at CBA Syracuse in September, 1950.\nThat’s very simplistic of Christ isn’t. it? Even more simplistic is the “parable” of the Last Judgment where FOUR TIMES we are told the litany of what we must do to prove our love of God. It is, in the end, it is what we do for “these the least of my brethren.” In my view, both the Great Commandments and the Last Judgment are about the mandate to be selfless and not selfish.\nIn sum, because it’s getting late and I have work to do, I submit the following ridiculously simple equations.\nSelfishness = Evil\nSelflessness = Love.\nThere are a few patches of humor in my manuscript that are no mistake.

Perhaps also, we might apply e words of Christ rebuking the deliberate obtuseness of the Pharisees and priests:\n“When you see a cloud rise in the west, straight away, you say, ‘There is a shower coming’ and so it is that a shower comes. And when you see the westwind blow, you say ‘There will be heat’ and then that happens.

The fact is that  he had a hypothesis that even he realized was incomplete when it came to the image formation problem.\nIt is not logical to combine the critique of his incomplete image formation hypothesis with criticism of his documented and work on the threads from the carbon test area.\nIt’s really depressing that people who have an argument with his image hypothesis then feel it necessary to blow smoke about his work on the carbon test site threads. \nIt’s apple and oranges. Logically it is self-defeating for one faction to try to discredit another faction on an issue. We should be open to multiple view points. There is no conflict between the proof that the carbon testing area was subject to repairs and that the image formation process implicates the resurrection directly. One, the carbon testing, is directly resolvable by scientific testing of the physical threads. Rogers did that. The other is still a bit over the horizon.\n\n","date":"April 30, 2014 at 6:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/28/discovery-promoting-shroud-video-on-feature-about-two-new-saints/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Discovery Promoting Shroud Video on Feature About Two New Saints"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"I am not sure how Daveb’s comment wound up on this thread, but it is welcome non-the-less and I will tie it to the video and Charles Freeman.\nTomorrow, I will dine with an individual who as a PhD in History from Princeton and a relationship with my family. She has published and hopefully will not perish. I asked her about History Today and it turns out that History Today is not peered reviewed. Given Charles Freeman’s blather about his research and the attention to the History Today article, I ask Charles a question: Was your article in History Today vetted by a formal peer-reviewed process? Yes or no.\nSecond, Daveb’s comment is thorough (as usual) and confines not only the D’Arcis memorandum and the Chevalier-Thurston screeds to the dust bin of history but repeats a rather obvious speculation (that Ian Wilson proposed) that whatever D’Arcis was told, the artist was talking about a copy of the Shroud. And as we know, from a very early time after the first exposition, artists started to copy the Shroud.\nThe history of the Shroud after the first exposition indicates the distinct possibility that Shroud had been withdrawn from public view and it is quite possible that the cannons of the Lirey Church were displaying a copy of the Shroud which was after all their bread and butter. But I may hypothesize the wheel. In fact, see the following article by Luigi Fossati published in Shroud Spectrum in 1983: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi08part5.pdf\nThe point is, as Daveb (and earlier Wilson and then Fossati) points out, the Chevalier-Thurston hypothesis was itself a hoax. \nThe video posting of the film narrated by Sr. Damien like the STURP report before it and every other peer reviewed publication that I am aware of, annihilates any painting thesis and actually ties together some loose ends. For example why did Nicodemus produce such a large amount of material for the entombment? It wasn’t all meant for the body but to also coat the tomb in a manner that was common to tombs at the time. Watch the video as the mystery is unraveled. (And the Gospel account of Nicodemus’s action substantiated).

If the Shroud is authentic, with the possible exception of nuclear weapons, it is the most important object on the face of the earth. Do you have another nominee?\nAn authentic Shroud confirms the reality of Jesus Christ, his horrible torture and his crucifixion. It also offers circumstantial evidence that support the account of his Resurrection as told in the Gospels.\nThose are matters of more than “academic interest.” I don’t know what that phrase means on your side of the Pond, but on this side it is more or less synonymous with “hypothetical” or “theoretical.” \nThis is why I think Jesus Christ and his Shroud are of more than hypothetical importance. We are facing the threat of an apocalypse that I have dubbed the “The Apocalypse of Selfishness.” It is the selfishness exploitation of the environment that causes many scientists to project the effective extinction of  humanity within 100 years. \nJesus Christ is the example of selfish love martyred by the disciples of selfishness.\nLet me give you a freebie. The last four paragraphs of my book;\n“The power of the selfish conduct which drove humanity forward\nthrough evolution is now driving humanity to extinction. It is in our power to\nresist that, but our resistance must be through acts of selfless love both\ncollectively and individually.\n“Humanity may survive another 100 years or perhaps another 100\nmillion. Because of the triumph of selfishness, it may end when the world\nbecomes a poisonous, toxic rock unsuitable for any habitation. Or, humanity\ncould be extinguished when a massive meteorite or asteroid plummets to\nearth starting a chain of events that will render human life untenable.\nWhether we, collectively or individually, find our lives overwhelmed by\nselfish power, we can survive no matter how beleaguered we may feel or\nbecome, remembering always that God is love.\n“Every human being is gifted with that reflective consciousness that\nremoves us from the mundane and opens the path to the eternal\nconsciousness.

For it to have worked by his process would have required days of exposure in bright sun light. – of a rotting corpse. Yet no evidence of corruption appears on the Shroud. Not to mention the little problem of when was the blood added.\nStill the program spend precious minutes of air time reenacting medieval forgers working their camera obscura.

Once more into breach. Bravo Andy, bravo. There is no interwoven cotton on the Shroud in chief. That is the quite positive determination of the STURP team. Whether the interwoven cotton  in the C14 sample itself was sufficient to skew the C14 results, the fact is that Rogers identified the linen in C14 as being of medieval or later manufacture. The initial impulse to think the cotton was the principal skewing agent was incorrect. It was the medieval manufacture of the patch with new European linen that was the principal cause. The test for vanillin by Rogers on the fibers from the Shroud in chief was negative – zero. The presence of vanillin in the sample taken from this woebegone corner was positive. They were not the same material.\nWhat you have pointed it reinforces the fact that the cotton would not have been in the Shroud when obtained by Joseph of Arimathea. As a devout Jew he would not have purchased a mixed item. As a matter of fact, when it was purchased by Joseph the science supports the conclusion that there was no cotton in the Shroud. Transient cotton contamination was observed. Not interweaving and splicing as occurred on the C14 sample.\nThe interwoven and spliced cotton is an important marker, but the principal proof of age is the vanillin tests. \nPS: This discussion has really helped me sharpen my view.

I would be interested in any tests demonstrated contrary results in the non-C14 areas from the main portion of the Shroud.. That test was limited to the linen fiber content of both C14 area and non-C14 areas. Has anyone replicated those tests or shown them to be in error?\nI also recall that explanations that the vanillin content being non-existent may have been caused by the fire in 1532. That of course would mean that the anomalous C14 area was certainly much younger than than the main body. Now the vanillin content may be a rough indicator compared to other methods of measuring age, but the difference between existence and non-existence is pretty absolute.\nLet me quote Rogers directly:\n“Sometimes it is simpler to do an experiment. The fire of 1532 did that experiment\nfor us. Any heating at the time of the fire would decrease the amount of vanillin in the\nlignin as a function of the temperature and time heated. Different amounts of vanillin\nwould have been lost in different areas, depending on the temperature and how long the\ntemperature took to return to normal.. No samples from any location on the Shroud gave\nthe vanillin test. Since the Shroud and other very old linens do not give the vanillin test, I\nbelieve that we can be confident that the cloth is quite old. It is very unlikely that the linen\nwas produced during medieval times. See Chapter IX for an explanation of the difference\nbetween the radiocarbon age determination and the observations on the linen’s production\ntechnology and composition.” (Rogers, p. 43, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, Barrie Schwortz, Florrisant, CO.,  2008) (Barrie was the editor and publisher of Rogers’ book which is available on Lulu.com)\nWhat this may mean is a direct connection between the Margaret of Austria’s will and the patch is not likely. However, that was a theory or speculation. The key is  the difference in composition, whatever the cause. \nThe fact is that we do not know, and will probably never know, how many times the Shroud was altered or mended. Enzo Delorenzi, a member of the Turin Commission that studied the Shroud in 1969 and 1973, wrote:\n“…I should like to mention the impression I received during\nthe course of my examination, namely, that more pairs of\nhands have carried out the darning than is suggested in the\nhistorical records (the four Clarissas of Chambery, the\nBlessed Valfre and the Princess Clotilde).” \nBecause  the only interwoven cotton verified on the Shroud is in the anomalous area of the C-14 testing, what  Berry and Freeman  have demonstrated is that the anomalous area is in fact of medieval origin. QED\nDoes anyone have any evidence of this cotton interwoven in any other area of the Shroud?  Rogers had fibers from non Raes -C14 areas of the Shroud and checked those against his findings of he Raes sample. They were different and he did not find interwoven cotton.\nI think I cam agree with Berry and Freeman: the C14 area contained medieval cotton and linen inter woven. To prove that it is not anomalous, demonstrate were else on the Shroud such interwoven fibers exist? Do  they exist throughout the Shroud?  Note, there are other patches but only some are documented.\nEvidence other Mde Fleury-Luxemburg’s visual observations is necessary because the contrary evidence is “deep” scientific examinations. Until someone does, I’m moving on although I will cover this in a post to my blog sometime this week if I have a chance to do it right.\nLet me state, I appreciate these interchanges. I will adjust my thoughts when appropriate. There is great deal of romance to the Margaret of Austria will theory. It appears that it will never be proven. It also appears that while Rogers and his associates proved the anomalous nature of the C14 area, he may have  may disproven the will theory.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 7:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"Colin,\nI think I made myself clear in my last post. There have been detailed scientific examinations of the Shroud particularly in 1978. None of  the STURP scientists found interwoven carbon in the parts of the Shroud they were examining.  The lower corner that was frequently handled throughout the public expositions of the Shroud through 1933 was not an object on interest because they were concentrating on the image and blood stains, none of which were in that corner.\nThere is an interesting papers by Mark Oxley that covers the water front. http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf\nOne thing I learned from the Oxley paper that I had not noticed before is a comment by Rogers that the procedures for cleaning the samples prior to the C14 tests would have removed the evidence of the dye that he found.  Rogers samples were not decontaminated and therefore the evidence of the dye was still there. I would appreciate your not arguing this point with me. None of my research is original and I rely on published sources. Read the sources such Oxley’s article and then if you have counter sources or observations state them. But the Shroud is a physical object and there is an enormous amount of published data on its scientific examination. Seat of pants observations or “trust me, I am a physicist,” without citation to that data, just  don’t cut it. That certainly  applies to art historians who carefully opine with out any detailed reference to the scientific data.\nAs I noted in an earlier post today, the rapture that you have proven that the interwoven cotton was of medieval origin only proves that the patch is newer than the main body of the Shroud which lacks such interwoven cotton. QED\nI am sorry that my request to Freeman to produce his resources offended you. I think my language while sharp was appropriate. I sure you are aware, given your background,  of the old adage: “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.”\nPerhaps my work at sometime will invoke a more public debate beyond this blog. I certainly hope so.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 8:37 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"At some point, I will address the difference between pseudo-skeptics and skeptics in depth, but not today. The difference is that the a true skeptic will recognize when the burden of proof shifts. I believe the enormous volume of literature demonstrating the anomalous nature of the C14 sample area has shifted the burden. The scientific examinations of actual samples of fibers from other parts of the Shroud demonstrate no interwoven carbon. If you maintain that the C14 site is not anomalous, demonstrate the places apart from the C14 site where interwoven carbon exists and where there is comparable amounts of vanillin to the patch era.\nPlease pseudo-skeptics understand that the burden has shifted and Rumpelstiltskin tantrums will not change that fact. The ball is in your court.\n\n","date":"October 22, 2013 at 8:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"author":"john_klotz","post":"This is a fascinating blog by someone well versed in Catholic theology and history (or so it appears to me).
