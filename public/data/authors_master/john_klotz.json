It is a factual circumstance that supports authenticity. Any single item of circumstantial evidence rarely “proves” anything. The issue is whether it is consistent with one side of the matter at issue because if its inconsistent it start to point in the opposite direction. It is an accumulation of circumstances that point in the same direction that eventually proves the case.. The nudity of Christ in the Shroud image is consistent with the fact of his burial after a nude crucifixion. All that en wrapped were the burial linens. Now how many images of a nude Christ on the cross are there? Is the answer one? or two or even ten? How many original images of Christ with his genitals with a loin cloth. I would hazard a guess that there may be significantly more than 100,000. Now how many reproductions of loin cloth covered genital area are there? There are more than two billion Christians living to day.Counting Rosary reproductions, , sacred icons and even cheesy reproductions of the crucifixion,over the span of nearly two millennia I would suggest there are tens of million if bnot hundreds of millions. The odds that the naked Christ of the Shroud is not unique and attributal to its authenticity claim probably run to at least 100,000 to 1 or .00001. . I sometimes find that “true believers” fight the use of reasonable inferences from the evidence because they insist that it be a matter of faith. (That’s not you Louis) The merger of science and religion is proceeding apace. Some Catholic theologians are way ahead of the crowd in recognizing the Chardian confluence of Science and Religion.

It is indeed a work of art drawn from the Shroud and expresses the agony and suffering of the Man in the Shroud. A small forensic note: the statute demonstrates that the Man in the Shroud was in a state of rigor mortis (knees bent at time of death). That means that it is likely that the image was transferred to the Shroud within 48 hours of his death. Let’s see, under normal circumstances rigor mortis would have been released by 3:00 pm the Sunday after the Friday execution. That’s sometime after the accounts of Mary Magdalene’s discovery of the missing body at day break Sunday morning.

To claim that there was once a global Christianity ignores much of Asia including of course China as well as sub Saharan Africa. On the other hand, the truly reformist and ecumenical spirit of Pope Francis embracing all who love whatever their particular religious flavor may very well be a wave of the future of the Church and Christianity. Christ may appear in many different guises for He is, after all, “only” Love. This is of particular relevance to me right now because last week my wife and I saw a revival of the “King and I.” I’ll spare you all my critique but one the most impressive parts of revival was a complex ballet based upon Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

However, specious arguments from pseudo skeptics, self described as scientists, really don’t provide much enlightenment. I won a gold medal for science in high school. That does not make me a scientist. Neither did the fact that one of my instructors may have had a teaching certificate for science make him a scientist. Joe Nickel’s white lab coat and microscope do not make him a scientist, neither does his degree in journalism. However, I do have a lifetime of experience is evaluating evidence and arguments seeking to determine the truth. I do think that some of the self described scientists could enlighten us with say a listing of their peer reviewed published articles and their degrees. On the other hand, Colin Barry is someone with some scientific credentials and a legitimate claim to being a scientist. That doesn’t make his claim that this Image of the Shroud of Turin is Jacques De Molay other than nonsense. I have spent more than five decades reading the science pages of the New York Times on a daily basis. I have on occasion subscribe to Scientific America. I remember at first being a little discombobulated when I read several decades ago that the basis of all existence was actually an exercise in the law of probabilities. I was somewhat mollified when I asked myself: Who’s law is the law of probabilities? Bottom line is this: spare us the claim of superior knowledge of a “scientist.” Just give us facts and we will make our own judgment’s. In my considered opinion, weighing all the facts and evidence, the shroud of Turin is authentic and is consistent with the Resurrection.

The event horizon is the place beyond which observation can not be made but at the horizon there is very much to observe. Observation of the horizon is one way we know the black hole exists, For example, let’s take either dawn or sunset. Before the sun rises we know its coming because the horizon lights up. At dusk, the sun disappears but the horizon remains visible and we know the sun was there. It’s not a perfect analogy by far, but its observation of the effects of a black hole that tells us it’s there. That observation disappears at a point. It’s where it’s the point where the visual effects can no longer be observed that we reach an event horizon. It is not that there is no light in the black hole, it is that light can not escape the gravity of the black hole. As I wrote on my blog concerning the death of my son Michael that death is the ultimate event horizon. See my original comment: http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2007 10 01 archive.html where I used “event horizon” as a metaphor for death and a second comment where I expand the thought because of the work of Stuart Hammeroff. Http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2012 08 01 archive.html I have an disagreement with some who do not believe that the Resurrection is discoverable. If a physical body processed to something else then it should not be surprising that there are artifacts of the body or the process that were left behind, The image on the Shroud may be an artifact of the Resurrection. It is not the glorified body of St. Paul but rather it is the body as the last moment it could be seen. Because we can not see beyond that artifact, it is in at least in metaphorical or symbolical sense an “event horizon.” Then again, as we used to sing in the heady days of Vatican II, “love makes symbols real.”.","date":"2013-10-13","mins":"10:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/12/in-case-you-missed-isabel-piczeks-wonderful-paper/","cat":"art","title":"In case you missed Isabel Piczek’s wonderful paper"},{"id":"comment-129941","author":"john_klotz","post":"Colin, It amazing how chaotic the world has become that it is almost impossible to simply ascribe labels to individuals. I think you should note that the label I ascribed to you is “scientist.” That was not written by me as “irony” but as recognition of a fact. As far as Jacques de Molay is concerned, I think like Leonardo there is more than one de Molay. There is an historical individual named de Molay and there are all the de Molays of myth. To posit de Molay as the figure on the Lirey badge is to honor a de Molay of myth. I expect that the real de Molay was neither the evil, devil worshipping charicature drawn by King Philip and his henchman nor the secular saint honored by the Masons. I do not think finding the real de Molay is possible. Leonardo was a very complex individual of great genius. There may very well be secrets of himself that he kept. However, was he the champion of an underground stream of heresy and conspiracy? Frankly, I doubt it extends as far as the Leonardo of either Holy Blood, Holy Grail or the da Vinci Code. One I’ve read and one I haven’t. There are mysteries that demand resolution because of their importance. Deciphering Christ is important to this day. I am not sure that decoding da Vinci or de Molay rises to that level of importance. The one I read claims to be history. As some of those who I confide in are aware, I am struggling with an issue of supreme importance to to me and I think posterity. We are deep into what I refer to as to “Apocalypse of Selfishness.” The sixth mass extinction of species is underway. One species extinguished may be us. It just so happens that suddenly on the world stage there appears a personalty who may very well be the one most important voice in leading humanity away from the brink of extinction. He happens to be that most despised of creatures in the view of some de Molay adherents: a Roman Catholic pope. We are a long way from King Philip and de Molay and the Borgias. We are not along way from He who was martyred by selfishness for the answer to the problems we face begin with an extraordinary exercise of selflessness epitomized by Him and recorded on the Shroud of Turin. We have a prophet proclaiming that right now. His name is Francis.

There is no likelihood that any coating of any kind managed to survive this treatment.” “I suppose” is that a scientific judgment? You admit that one sample in fact fell apart. Then state “There is NO likely hood that any coating OF ANY KIND managed to survive this treatment.” No likelihood means 100% assurance. I know of few things on this earth 100% assured except in the words of the American rabble rouser and enemy of the English King Benjamin Franklin who wrote: “‘In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” The labs themselves stated they believed their accuracy was a 95%. But NO ONE is claiming that he coating is what was carbon dated, it was the linen threads that were. The importance of the cotton and the encrustrations was that they were a marker in the Raes and crabon samples of the new (medieval) linen. How much time have you spent examining the Scanning Electronic Microscope photographs of the late John Brown of Georgia Tech published by shroud.com in 2005 a few days after peer reviewed papers in Thermocheimca Acta papers. Peer review, like carbon data, is no 100% guarantee of accuracy, but it is a starting point. Outside of Jull’s silly 2010 paper published by Radiocarobon, a journal of which he was the editor, and the original 1989 Nature article which noted only in its acknowledgements but did not comment, on a finding of cotton in the sample, is there any other peer reviewed article you are relying on? In fact when you whnen to the communication of the lab that found the cotton cited you find that cotton was “intertwined” with the sample fibers. In any event the findings of Rogers was that the linen was new and this the carbon dating skewed. Future tests when finally allowed can deal with dating issues at the quantum level. In fact the STURP experiments used various tools that depended on the quantum actions of the samples (flouresence for example is the discharge of a photon when the the material is agitated). Marcello Truzzi who was the philosopher of “pseudo skepticism” stated that when you dispute something as not being proved, unless you present evidence of a contrary position, you can not claim the contrary position has been proved, only that the principal proposition has not been proved. Numerous articles [published in peer reviewed journals have demonstrated that the carbon tests were flawed. There is a wealth of material on shroud.com citing sources on the carbon dating which note false, even supercilious dating results.

It’s a drawing of something the monk saw and he tried to replicate. It may not have been the Shroud but a representation of the Shroud perhaps generations removed from the Shroud. Even photographs copied and reproduced in multiple generations lose detail in each generation. The “L” shaped holes are a fingerprint. That the fingerprint was frequently copied makes them more important not less, unless you can point to actual representations that are clearly the “L” shaped holes and could not have originated with the Shroud – Sayancient China or Egypt circa 1 BCE or earlier – before there was a Christ or a crucifixion. If you can’t, all you have unsupported speculation from a skeptic. That and $5.00 buys a medium mocha at Starbucks.

I was a little unhappy with the picture because the perspective of the picture and perhaps the camera lens made his head much larger than the body. The other day while working on a piece of my work in progress, I was struck by an insight that explains some of the quirkiness that some found in the Shroud image. Bogie’s head in the image is in disproportion to his body. He is sitting and I was taking the picture from above him. The disproportion of the image is essentially an inverted triangle. What it does is define the angle from which the picture was taken. The disproportion that some see in the Shroud, is not proof that it is a painting, it may be an indication of the angles at which different parts of the image were created. Possibly only one, maybe a couple or more. The proof that the Shroud is not a painting was proved by STURP whose examinations were conducted by devices that functioned at the quantum level. We do not understand yet how it was created. I think the biggest fools of all are art experts who proclaim it a painting. Tell me art expert: was he the artist left or right handed? A good one can discern that. Where was the light source? What was the directionality of the brush strokes? How did your medieval artist learn about serum halos around blood clots which on the Shroud revealed by X Rays. Why did he/she add features such as serum halos which were invisible until detected by twentieth century technology? Point is that the “distortions” in the image don’t prove it was a painting. In fact, the variations of proportionality point in the opposite direction.

You have two items that in my opinion are beyond doubt: blood stains and an image that in general support the Gospel accounts. That’s two points which make a straight line. There is no need of coins. Or perhaps it is not a straight line but an arrow pointed towards the Resurrection. I don’t know whether I am bemused or riled by people who claim there could be no physical proof of the Resurrection. What there is physical proof is of is a bloodied body with the image of a crucified man created within three days of his death. There are accounts that he was resurrected. There are accounts of his appearance after the supposed resurrection but that his appearance had changed. There is the account of Mary Magdalene being the first person he appeared to and his warning her not to touch him because he had not yet gone to the Father. There is an account of St. Paul that he appeared to him in a blinding light. Honestly, is there a simpler explanation for these accounts other than he in fact was resurrected? Alas, skeptics who can not accept the fact of resurrection must deny it and blind their eyes to the facts before them. Those who claim that science can NEVER “prove” the resurrection underestimate science because it is knocking on the door and that door is the quantum information of the universe (whatever that is). Perhaps, the issue will not be solved in our lifetime (or at least mine). It may be decades away. But two days ago Pope Francis outlined the horrific future awaiting humanity if it does not repent its selfish abuse of the environment. There is one word he did not use: Apocalypse. I suggest that Apocalypse is an apt description of the future waiting humanity if we can not mend our ways.

D’Muhala immediately called Jumper and asked him what to do about the cable. Jumper replied: “The hell with it. Send them our ninety six hour protocol, and we will argue it out when we get there.” It ought to have been clear to the American scientists by this time, that they were facing a good deal of political intrigue in Turin and that many in the Centro were virulently anti American and resented the intrusion of the Americans. It also appeared that there were those in Turin and the Vatican who were welcoming the American initiative. The issue would be decided on the ground in Turin. “On September 28, the sudden death of Pope John Paul I added a whole new complexity to their situation. “The following day the STURP team embarked at Kennedy Airport for Turin.

I am not sure this “debate” among the experts (Zugibe vs. Everybody else) is determinative of the essential issue: the authenticity of he Shroud, and beyond that the reality of the Resurrection. Occam’s razor is not a scientific principle but a philosophical one. For example, there is no simplest explanation of quantum mechanics. It does have its application in science. For example, the triumph of the Galileo Newton view over the Ptolemaic view of planetary and solar orbits. Ptolemy began with the view point that the Earth was the center of the Universe which was really a philosophical religious theory revelation. Thus the planets and the sun had to do a little loop in their orbits around the earth. Actually, the mathematics worked pretty well in making predictions of eclipses and such. However, it was simply wrong and it was simply wrong for more than a millennia. However, it was not wrong enough to spare Galileo the Inquisition and the danger of death at the stake. Newtonian physics became a philosophical position as well as a scientific one despite the questions it could not answer correctly. In fact that the duality of light as both wave and particle was demonstrated a century before the advent of quantum mechanics. Newtonians were aghast. I am not so concerned about how the lash marks were preserved as to when the body parted company with the Shroud. Does this debate have anything to offer on that issue? Although it is subject to some deviations, to me the most important thing about the image is this: the body of the Man in the Shroud shows signs of rigor mortis and no signs of putrefaction. Rigor mortis begins upon death and is released approximately 48 hours later. The evidence of putrefaction bi products emerge from the body approximately 48 hours later (there is a relationship between putrefaction of the muscle tisue and the release of rigor mortis.) The time of Christ’s death was Three PM Friday. 48 hours after Christ’s death would have been Three PM Sunday afternoon. Does anybody have any idea what might have happened to Christ’s body during that period of time? I do, and more than a billion people since that time have had the same idea.

Since that initial discovery, in fits and starts science has revealed more of the secrets of image. Thomas de Wesselow’s remarkable book “The Sign” demonstrates inadvertently the challenge of the Shroud. De Wesselow makes a convincing case for the Shroud’s authenticity but then speculates that the early Christians mistook the Shroud for a risen Jesus. He does so because as an agnostic he can not accept the possibility of the Resurrection. There’s the rub. The reason everyone, included some who believe in authenticity, are reluctant to state a conclusion, is because behind the issue of authenticity lurks the fundamental issue of our existence: the Resurrection.

I felt such a surge of empathy for Him that has only grown as I viewed each revelation. I believe that it was in Ian Wilson’s latest book there was a description of Barbet’s work in determining the process of how the nails were driven through the wrist and how excruciating the pain of that “minor” detail must have been as the nail enlarged the natural passage. And how much more excruciating that pain was than if a nail was driven through the palm as usually depicted. Whatever empathy I felt reading that was a gift of science. But whatever my empathy, I could never actually feel such pain. But knowledge of the Shroud and what it reveals is a gift of Science. That some “scientists” still have eyes that do not see doesn’t detract one wit from the work of the scientists who have brought us this revelation. In my very first catechism lesson more than six decades ago, I was taught that we could never really understand God who was eternal. I quoted recently from Richard Wright’s Evolution of God.

There are profound differences. What brings us together is the Shroud of Turin.I hope we can respect each other even with our differences as to scripture and accept that there are differences. “Biblical exegesis” is a fancy phrase for how you read and interpret the Bible. Many, many biblical scholars are attempting to cull from scripture the nub of reality because much of scripture is metaphor and allegory. Some like John Crosson tend to throw out the baby with the bathwater, particularly on the issue of the Resurrection, but still regard themselves as Christians, Catholics even. Pope Benedict when he was Cardinal Ratzinger described original sin as a great problem for the Church. He rather directly wrote of the origin of Genesis as the compendium of creation myths from other cultures that actually changed in the first milenium BCE and did not reach its current form until the Babylonian captivity. A Howard Professor has written that original sin is original selfishness. I buy that. What we struggle with is the selfish residue of evolution and what marks humanity in Teilhard’s view is when. Alone among animals, it developed the awareness of self and introspection. Fundamentalists may find these ideas a long way from their faith, but it is at its core a deeply understood Christianity. We are not going to agree on theology and some may not even agree on the fact of evolution. Let’s concentrate on the Shroud and it’s message, the declaration of faith: Christ has died, Christ has risen.

Barrie was not “hired” to be a photographer. None of the STURP team were “hired.” Expenses were reimbursed when money was raised but they were not working for a fee. There is an arrogant attitude displayed by the authors in his dismissal of Barrie as a hired photographer. Barrie had a Masters degree from the leading photography school in the United States and had in fact done complex work with scientists who were dealing with photographs of nuclear explosions and readouts on analytical scientific devices. Photography is in fact an instrument of science. No where is that fact demonstrated more than the Pia photographs and the reactions to them. As there being “no sign of death on these clots” there were plenty of signs of death on the Shroud including the high levels of bilirubin and the seepages from the the wounds particularly the lance wound which has been identified as post mortem. Then there is the finding of rigor mortis by a slew of pathologists. But there is one thing that troubles me: it’s the authors use of Yiddish argot to depict the words of the scientists. There were Jewish scientists who worked with STURP, they were not a majority of the scientists. They were well educated and well qualified. Why the use of Yiddish? Is the author Jewish seeking to debunk Christ? Or is the author crudely anti semitic? Or is he simply a Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce fan? Much of contemporary American humor has it roots in the Jewish experience by comedians, who learned and honed their in the Catskills. None of them were a part of the STURP team. Then again, I sometimes feel that story of my life is like the punchline of Yiddish joke about a man who was offered a job by his Rabbi: a shekel a day to sit by the village gate and watch for the Messiah.”The pays not much, but the work is steady,” the Rabbi assured him..","date":"2015-08-24","mins":"5:31 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

However, I think your quote of a “young surgeon” to rebut Bucklin is a bit off the mark if you are seriously pitting his opinion against Bucklin’s. Your “young” surgeons statement is not very precise. What does “length of time” mean. Ten minutes? Two hours, a day? From the Gospel account we are told that a Roman soldier thrust a lance into Christ’s side and “blood and water” flowed out. What the pathologists have told us is that the water was in fact a clear fluid. It was in fact a signal of his death as the Roman soldiers probably knew from their experience as executioners. Christ was hanging on the cross at the time. How familiar was your young surgeon with the STURP findings and subsequent analysis. Had he scanned it once or twice or did he labor long hours into the night reviewing its multitudinous reports? How many autopsies has your young surgeon done? A ten? A hundred? a thousand? Bucklin had performed thousands. Is Bucklin’s report in inerrant scripture? Of course not. Zugibe has disputed among other things the cause of death as determined by his multiple predecessor pathologists – but Zugibe found a cause of death. He also critiqued the nail through the wrist finding which was frankly a matter of anatomical semantics. What we come down to is really a question of circumstantial evidence which in other contexts “atheist Pope” Richard Dawkins as decreed to be superior to eye witness testimony in many cases. The accumulation of circumstances can lead to a conclusion. We do not order our life by proof beyond a reasonable doubt but in the case of the death of the man in the shroud, doubt, in the totality of the circumstances, death is more than reasonable and beyond “reasonable” doubt. Jurors are sometimes told that “reasonable doubt” is a not a doubt “that come in the meddle of the night” but in the light of day. In law we have what are called “curbstone opinions.” That means someone asks a lawyer a question about the law when there is no lawyer client relationship. When the lawyer answers the questions he often ends with Of course, that’s my curbstone opinion.”What that means is “you are not my client and you can not rely on it.” An opinion identified by someone as only by “young surgeon” is a classic medical “curbstone opinion.” It’s like the guy in his kitchen performing research with his tea kettle. Another example of “curbstone opinions” is Charles Freeman’s unidentified experts who are free with their opinions but OMG don’t cite them by name. Circumstantial evidence about Christ is all that we have. The eyewitnesses are long gone. If I am sounding a bit too much like a lawyer, proving facts in real life is what we do. One of those facts often litigated is cause of death. In jurisdictions which still have a death penalty, circumstantial evidence can also cause death..","date":"2015-08-27","mins":"7:04 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/24/oy-vey-weve-got-a-problem/","cat":"blood_studies","title":"Oy vey!

I have dealt sarcastically with some of the claims made here. For example that the man in the Shroud was actually Jacques de Molay. That is a claim that can be answered with scorn, maybe even satire. The issue of whether Christ was dead or alive is not such an issue becasue it goes to the very heart of Christian belief. I did not have the benefit of a “Jesuit” education. In law school one of my colleagues who had attended a Jesuit College stated that he had been told by a Jesuit priest that the only doctrine that was a sine qua non for a Christian was the Resurrection. Now there are some who regard themselves Christian who will argue with that but I think it is a fair statement. Others may disagree and that’s okay for in the final analysis our individual salvation is determined to our fealty to two great commandments of love. The bookend holy days that mark the Christian faith are the nativity which celebrates the transfiguration of the human spirit by the birth of God made man and Easter, which is the hope of our salvation. They have been both satirized cruelly and ignorantly in the past. So when you begin a discussion of the issue of the reality of Christ’s death and Resurrection with a rather crude ethnic patter, that’s just not okay. On the other hand, the reputation of the Islamic sect that has your adherence is very okay.

Based upon all the evidence available, the Shroud is a burial cloth of Jesus Christ. It is a matter of probabilities. How many Jews were crucified in 30 33 CE who claimed to be the Messiah? That is the specific event we are considering. Best bet is probably only one, but I would like to be challenged on that with specific cases if they exist. Saying there MAY have been others when there is no historical evidence of any others in that time period does not create doubt, reasonable or otherwise. Yes, there were other individuals who claimed to be the Messiah, but how many were crucified by the Romans circa 30 CE (AD). The Roman historian Tacitus noted that “Christus” was executed by Pontius Pilot at that time period but that the execution didn’t put an end to his superstition which spread to Rome where 20 or so years later Nero launched his persecution of the Christians that ultimately took the lives of Peter and Paul. IS THERE ANY OTHER CULT WHICH SPREAD TO ROME AFTER ITS FOUNDER WAS EXECUTED BY PONTIUS PILATE? NAMES PLEASE!!!! It’s circumstantial evidence – you betcha. But every year in the United States where the standard is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, people are convicted of crimes and sometimes executed on the basis of circumstantial evidence. We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The circumstances are such that they establish the authenticity of the Shroud, and, I believe, beyond REASONABLE doubt. Reasonable doubt is a not a lingering suspicion that comes in the middle of the night. Where the facts point so strongly in one direction, reasonable doubt must then be based on facts. When evidence is adduced that a certain event probably happened, doubt not based on facts is not reasonable. There is no authentic doubt about the Shroud once it is established that it is a linen cloth that once enwrapped the body of a crucified man who was scourged, beaten, nailed to a cross and his side pierced with a post mortem (after death) spear wound. There is even evidence that he carried the cross bar on his shoulders and walked through streets that had limestone stone dust compatible with the streets of Jerusalem. There is also evidence that he fell and because he was carrying the cross bar, he couldn’t break his fall, injuring a knee and the tip of his nose. The accumulation of facts is overwhelming.

But the simple historical and scientific fact is that at the end of the last Ice Age humanity was in fact inundated by huge floods and rising tidal waters. The Persian Gulf was once an idyllic place where hunter gathers could prosper: A veritable lost Eden perhaps. The legend of a hero overcoming the flood sent by the God(s) exists in more than one ancient culture. They may be a tiny spark of truth in those legends.

I will give my inexpert answers and hopefully maybe someone with specific expertise can correct me, 1. What is an artistic convention? I believe an artistic convention is that something is portrayed in a similar way across a series of works so that eventually with a specific class or culture, it is portrayed in the same way. For example during the medieval ages, the crucified Christ was pictured with the nails driven through his hands and with a crown of thorns being a simple wreath. Those of course are not the conclusions drawn by most when analyzing the Shroud of Turin. 2. Doesn’t a convention have to start some where with a singular representation, or does it simply blossom all at once in many different places with no single origin? I would suggest that a convention begins with a single model or inspiration that is then copied and spread. 3. Do disparate conventions have disparate origins? For example, The Shroud of Turin shows no whip wounds on the chest.(Flogging with a whip on the chest would hasten death and possibly deny the executioners their crucifixion) Yet crucifixion renditions show flogging or lashes wounds on the chest. Am I correct that the Shroud does not? 4. Would it be fair to expect that oldest representation of any particular convention would be the first? 5. If all but one representation of a convention are paintings or works of art, and one isn’t and apparently predates the paintings or other works of art, is fair to say that the non painting probably is the source of the convention? 6. Am I being too obvious? Well, maybe so, but the origins of conventions that mimic the Shroud of Turin is, as many have already pointed out (Vignon and Wilson among others) that supports an early date for the Shroud,.","date":"2013-10-20","mins":"9:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/20/an-intriguing-9th-century-image-suggestive-of-the-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-max-patrick-hamon/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"An Intriguing 9th Century Image Suggestive of the Shroud – A Guest Posting by Max Patrick Hamon"},{"id":"comment-47878","author":"john_klotz","post":"Didn’t Colin B post to this blog that he wouldn’t have accepted the handcuffs placed on the selection process by the Vatican (at the instigation of the the carbon labs, by the way.)

STURP scientists had information in hand that would have prevented the chosen sample to be representative of the whole Shroud and required another site.. It was madness to chose the site they did, but madness the pseudo skeptics must latch onto to “prove” the medieval date of the Shroud. The fact that Jull is still fighting a rearguard action defending the Shroud demonstrates if not intellectual dishonesty, at least a desperate attempt to evade the truth. I would have thought the issue was effectively closed, but it will live on because the pseudo skeptics can accept the truth of the Shroud’s authenticity without calling into question their whole world view.

But when taken in conjunction with other representations, it points i a direction. There is enough uniqueness about the Shroud image that the appearance of its unique features in other works tends to indicate its antiquity and thus its highly probable authenticity.

Oxford claims that its pieces were used up. I don’t know what Zurich has said. Pam Moon was able to pry a copy of a photograph of Oxford’s sample before its was destroyed and had the photo examined by an expert and the results were dramatic. Coupled with the report that Oxford had discovered yellow cotton fibers entangled with the linen (as published in the BSTS), it appears that Oxford in doing its testing removed (a) cotton fibers and (b) probably black threads which were the indication of repairs by Valfre but would have appeared as random contamination to scientists who were totally at sea about the history of the Shroud when it was owned by the Savoys. Someone pointed out to me yesterday that the problem with the edges being frayed was not just the rough handling by the bishops but also the simple fact that the the Savoys were cutting pieces from the corner edges as relics for favored individuals. It appears that pieces from the Shroud edge were virtually parts of the dowry of Savoy princesses. When I first examined the Shroud photos closely one of the most striking thing was the very visible, large rectangular pieces from two corners of the Shroud, Those cuttings may have caused unraveling of the linen that had to be repaired. More so, perhaps, than the bishops. Rogers obviously could not carbon date the fibers that he had but he was able to discover important differences in composition between the fibers from the test area and the main body of the cloth. You can quarrel about what the differences meant but they were real. The fact that cotton discovered by Oxford was yellow matches the findings of Rogers and his colleagues. As far as I know, cotton is naturally white. Ever see a cotton field? I have. I would suggest before any one starts chewing the rug about this post, they review the Donna Campbell and Pan Moon postings.

The carbon dating was manipulated by the head of the pontifical academy who was advising John Paul II. The final decisions were made in a letter from the Vatican to the Archbishop of Turin who was given no discretion. Gonella played no role in the curtailing and virtual elimination of the protocols and the ouster of STURP from further examination of the SHROUD until after the carbon dating [Which rendered further testing moot for the time being. Turin and the Vatican felt burned, even betrayed. Emanuella Marinelli quotes Gonella has saying; “We were blacked mailed” on a presenation to the 2012 Valnecia Conference.] This is from my book which is the personal recollection of Rolfe’s contacts with Gonella prior to the formal announcement of the labs and the procedures for cutting the sample: “In May, Rolfe met with Gonella in Turin. Gonella informed him about changes in protocol that were going to be made. Rolfe was aghast. The ground had shifted. As he later noted:” “’All the meticulous preparations for the test were set aside. It was almost as if they didn’t care anymore. “‘They just abandoned all the protocols that had been agreed to by the international team of scientists, cut one sample from the corner (instead of seven from different areas), and sent it off to three arbitrarily selected laboratories (instead of blind and controlled tests to the world’s leading seven laboratories) “’Luigi was pale and apologetic. Hours before my [Rolfe’s] arrival he had been instructed ‘from above’ to abandon the protocols, scale back the tests and to allow just three of the labs to have a sample selected at random on the day. This was in sharp contrast to seven labs testing samples taken from several different strategically selected areas Even more disappointing from my point of view was the absence of anything binding on the labs to coordinate publication. De facto, the method of sampling would also make any real claim for the tests being done blind meaningless’.” “On June 5, 1987, Rolfe wrote his collaborators informing them that as far as he was concerned, the game was over. Father Rinaldi was shattered.”.","date":"2015-04-22","mins":"10:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/20/carbon-date-the-shroud-again/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Carbon Date the Shroud Again?"},{"id":"comment-197206","author":"john_klotz","post":"Louis, You venture into the corridors of Vatican intrigue at your own risk.

A pseudo skeptic is one who pretends to be open minded when asking questions but in fact is seeking to validate a contrary, pre existing belief. I would suggest that the “atheist pope” Richard Dawkins is also the world’s leading pseudo skeptic because he seeks to validate his atheism. The existence of any God is beyond question to him. There is no god and that’s that. Thus he discards everything in scripture. He may seem to hedge, but he uses too many semantic tricks. There’s the way he treats Teilhard in the God Delusion for example. But now to your main point (I think). I really can’t spend much time debating. The STURP team examined the Shroud with extremely precise optical instruments. Rogers found no gum arabic encrustations on the rest of the Shroud and no vanillin which was found on the samples from Raes and the carbon dating sample. I would recommend that you read Emanuella Martinella’s paper submitted at the 2012 Valencia conference. It’s 30 pages long, has 256 footnotes and 52 items in its bibliography. Https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf Also, have you ever read John Brown’s paper and examined his micro photographs which some of which had resolutions of 3000 X+ taken by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf To be honest with you, I am much less impressed with titles and hyphenated European names, but Dame Isabel Pizcek supported Rogers report when it was initially challenged by some in Turin, but supported by others because eyeball examination or handheld magnifying glass (ala Fleury Lemberg) can not compete with SEM The whole carbon dating affair wreaks of medieval skullduggery.

Leonardo, we now know drew a picture of her for a book celebrating her marriage. But she was indeed a lost princess in two ways. Four months after her wedding and Leonardo’s picture being bound into a celebratory book of her wedding, she died from apparent complications of pregnancy. But the wedding book and the drawing by Leonardo were carried some years later to Warsaw Poland by one of the Duke’s other daughters or heirs. History lost track of it. At some point the drawing was removed from the Warsaw volume and its existence was never recorded any place. There was no mention of it in any of the Leonardo literature prior to 2008.

First there is the application of spectral imaging technology to an issue of disputed false provenance that helped discover the truth.

Also note that P.H. South is cited by name. Further note that in the Textile Horizon’s article, Mr. South excludes the possibility of what they observed being a casual contamination but hypothesizes that it indicates a repair of the Shroud or a combining of the cotton with linen at the time the linen was spun. And the cotton was yellow, And the reaction of the Dr. Berry: invective attacking the STURP scientists who had nothing to do with the carbon dating and apparently alleging that with maniacal cleverness they wore cotton gloves so that the Shroud would be contaminated. I deeply regret the time I have spent drafting this reply. But history teaches that idiocy and histrionics can not be ignored for as Mark Twain once wrote: A lie travels halfway around the world while truth is putting on its shoes.” The truth as known in 1988, I submit, is there was cotton in the samples, it was not casual contamination, and a least one of carbon dating laboratories noted that fact but was rushing to complete the testing because they were late. That may not decide the issue. That was to await the work of Sue Benford, Joe Marino and Ray Rogers, 12 years later. John C.

Apparently either I have totally lost my ability to communicate a rational idea or Charles Freeman is not an advertisement for the intellectual prowess of of Cambridge graduates. It’s very simple: Different methods of bleaching leave different artifacts. In the case of the linen used on the Shroud it left bands of darker color which obvious on the Shroud. Okay, so people have been bleaching things for maybe 8,000 years or so. They all didn’t do it the same way, And the method some used might not leave artifacts of the process. In the case of the method used in ancient times on the Shroud it caused banding when different batches were used in the object.. Now, I will conceded that the process that caused banding nay have proceeded longer than I thought. One expert wrote a book and said it might have been used to 1250 at the outside. His name was Ray Rogers. But not after that. Benford Marino relied on an Oxford text to say that it stopped circa 300 400 CE. Now even taking Rogers figure of 1250 as the outside that would be the latest date for a forgery and there is no evidence that by 1250 the technology existed to forge the Shroud. In fact, there is now evidence that the technique to forge the Shroud did not exist by 2013 qand it is very doubtful it will exist in 2050 although maybe you never know about the the future. What the banding does demonstrate is that the method used to dye the linen existed at the time of Christ. If it did not THAT would be evidence of in authenticity. The Holland cloth linen did not exhibit bands. That’s because in Holland they developed a method of bleaching that did not lead to banding. The Holland cloth was used by the Poor Clare nuns who repaired the Shroud in circa 1534. But I can not understand how a supposedly educated man does not understand that different methods of bleaching might leave different artifacts of one kind or another. The banding is such an artifact and do not insult everyone’s intelligence by claiming hat the banded dyed linen in the Shroud is indistinguishable from any other method of dying. Really guys and gals, I do not believe that I am that inarticulate and neither was Benford./Marino or Rogers. There may be a disagreement when the dying process used on the Shroud stopped being used, but if any body has any evidence it was used after 1250 I’d like to see it. “Well, maybe” unless backed by facts doesn’t hack it.

As a matter of fact after your intial message, and you pointed out that the Oxford reference might not in fact not cover linen cloths like the Shroud, I did in fact do a little research and found out that in his book, a Chemist’s Perspective, Ray Rogers placed the last possible date for bleach bands to be 1250 CE.

To say that people have been bleaching for 6,000 years is to dodge the question. There were different methods bleaching and some of the earliest methods gave uneven results so that when a larger object was made from linen bleached by the early processes bands were created. Evidence wise, it’s akin to fingerprints. Were there no bands that would be evidence casting doubt on the authenticity of the Shroud. If somone were to claim hat he had an oil painting of Julius Ceasar that he posed for while alive, you would laugh at him. Oil paintings for art was not used by the Romans. (Am I wrong?) If you want to say you don’t have time to study the issue, I’ll understand that. If you want to point out an inaccuracy, I’ll accept that. What is unacceptable is to write that bleaching has been done for thousands of years so it makes no difference. Have you ever given forensic evidence in court? Some art experts have. Trying to determine the province of a work of art can be worth tens (if not hundreds) of millions of ddollars. Cf La Principessa. Your answer wouldn’t fly. Usually, the argument is that science demands absolute answers and legal standards such as beyond reasonable doubt do not apply in the august chambers of science. I think that’s nonsense of course. As I have written: “We do not order our lives by proof beyond reasonable doubt.” I also have written: “Fear the person who has no doubt. Witness George Armstrong Custer.” The issue is whether the Shroud linen shows characteristics of an ancient pre medieval bleaching process. The Holland Cloth which is clearly of medieval origin, unlike the Shroud in chief shows no banding and it is clearly medieval having been added to the Shroud circa 1532. The fact the Shroud itself shows banding is an indication that it pre dates medieval. It may not be a 100% solution. But even if it’s 50 50, it’s an indication. The fact the bleaching process of the linen in the Shroud dates to the time of Christ is a fact about the Shroud. It certainly doesn’t eliminate all possibilities. If the Shroud was pristine of bands, that would be evidence of medieval manufacture. It is not a decisive fact as to the ultimate issue but it is a fact to be taken into account. Maybe, if I ever stop being distracted by the blog, I’ll get my manuscript done : ) Actually, I appreciate this interchange because it helps be sharpen my work.

In common parlance, we think of mold, or spilled milk, coffee, stain, bioplasitc coating maybe insects debris. It some unintended chemical process. However, what Rogers found, and what all the contamination experts ignore, that what occurred with reweaving is NOT contamination as the word is commonalty understood. The reweaving process included new threads of cotton AND NEW THREADS OF LINEN (new being medieval). Cotton dyed yellow was interwoven and spliced with NEW threads of linen because linen does not dye well. May I venture a statement which I would certainly like to see a rebuttal: how does new linen test older? If we were discussing mold or something like that (a coffee spill) that might be empirically demonstrable. But it is a semantic trick to call cotton spliced into new linen “contamination.” I really don’t have the time for a week or so to get into this. However, I really believe if someone is asserting that new linen interwoven in the Shroud samples would give an older date that the original linen, I really have to examine his data. I would suggest though what is needed is an examination of his definition. I must admit that the implication of Rogers finding new linen fibers didn’t really sink in at first, so if any scientists overlooked that then I understand. But if he/she deliberately ignored that then shame on him/her. Also, Only testing of the fiber samples from the sample area can answer the question. That was done by Rogers and the colleagues who he asked to review his work. Maybe Hugh or someone can advise us whether the his experts took into account the interweaving of dyed cotton with the new linen as a part of the repair which Donna Campbell has demonstrated from examination of the Oxford photograph.

That is not any bright idea of mine or Daveb, it’s what Rogers found and the scientists, with whom he collaborated, concurred. The corner of the Shroud from which the samples came was one clutched by the bishops when the Shroud was displayed. What Pam Moon did in her 2014 paper is put into perspective the known documented work of Valfre in repairing frayed parts of the Shroud. I was stunned when observing the photographs in the Donna Campbell 2014 paper by how clearly the evidence of repair in the Oxford sample emerged, including black threads which Valfre used which upset the Poor Sisters of St. Clare who to this day have a special relationship to the Shroud and were actually hovering in the background as STURP did its work in 1978.

Just make sure you understand how UK libel law works before you publish here, John. It could be expensive as the onus will be on you to prove your case.” Since I have now been threatened for libel for something Gove reported 28 years ago, perhaps it is best that I leave this repetitive discussion. But as I said, the 1988 c 14 tests are no longer a serious issue because the anomaly issue. It’s amazing how easy it is for our British brethren to challenge the scientific work of well established scientist like the late Ray Rogers. I have written what I intend to say about the carbon dating tests and it has been read by at least one or two people in UK without a threat of libel. That’s the second time Charles Freeman has warned me about libel. I guess they know that you can’t libel a dead man so they are free to throw Rogers into the trash can while suppressing free debate on this blog about survivors in the carbon labs. On the other hand, there is the United States Constitution and the following statute which is the law of this land (Since 1789). Also, because the Shroud is a matter of pyblic issues and I believe the particpants in the carbon dating were public figures there is a requirement of proving malice. It can be done. I successfully represented an individual who sued a public figure for libel during a political campaign and we won. I defeated a motion for summary judgment and won the appeal by the City. The City then settled. Tite’s participation in a internationally reported press conference, as well as his position with the British Museum would easily meet the public figure test. Oh well, having seen Stonehenge once in my life, I guess that’s enough. I will miss the Hod Pole on the canal south of Bath though. “28 U.S. Code § 4102 – Recognition Of Foreign Defamation Judgments “(1) In general.— Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a domestic court shall not recognize or enforce a foreign judgment for defamation unless the domestic court determines that— “(A) the defamation law applied in the foreign court’s adjudication provided at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press in that case as would be provided by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and by the constitution and law of the State in which the domestic court is located; or “(B) even if the defamation law applied in the foreign court’s adjudication did not provide as much protection for freedom of speech and press as the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State, the party opposing recognition or enforcement of that foreign judgment would have been found liable for defamation by a domestic court applying the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the constitution and law of the State in which the domestic court is located. “(2) Burden of establishing application of defamation laws.— The party seeking recognition or enforcement of the foreign judgment shall bear the burden of making the showings required under subparagraph (A) or (B)….” One final word. That Tite was being considered for a position at Oxford at the same time he was the impartial monitor of the carbon dating tests is a conflict of interest, at least in this country. If you were suing someone and your judge or referee was seeking employment with the person you are suing, wouldn’t that be a conflict of interest even in England? Or do different rules of ethics apply to Oxford and Cambridge. It certainly would be a conflict here and one would hope across the pond also. Oh, and by the way Charles, in this country the burden is on the defendant to prove falsity, not on the plaintiff to prove truth. And incidentally, that rule was established in the trial of Peter Zenger before the Revolution. It was one of the things that bothered the Brits about those undisciplined colonists.

Thus an elaborate concept is floated that is fodder for Shroud skeptics. There is enough hard scientific facts about the Shroud to support it’s authenticity in any court of law but not, perhaps, at the Oxford dining clubs. The important point of the image is that it’s real and it’s there. Also, it was created at a time the body of Jesus was still in it and that the body appears to have disappeared before putrefaction exuded waste materials on to the fabric, An argument that hypothesizes an earthquake of unknown force at an unknown precise time and therefor created the image may provide a some headlines, but those headlines as demonstrated by the earthquake theory are ultimately counter productive. We obviously need more science before we can “solve” the image problem. We are not there yet. However, the authenticity of the Shroud has, in my opinion been established and the attributes if the image point in the direction of the Resurrection. In my view, I must admit, if there was a Resurrection it would have entailed a process in itself that created he image.

Hugh is right. There was an unfortunate blow up between Rogers and Jackson becasue Rogers sharply criticized a Jackson article on image formation. I think that colors the live Jackson critique of the reweaving repair thesis. At St. Louis, Jackson who was supposed to moderate a panel discussion began with what I believed was a disingenuous description of the Rogers findings [not by name] on the composition of the sample area. It wasn’t just cotton contamination, but a finding the linen fibers in the samples were new [medieval] linen not created from flax by the same methods used circa 30 CE. In fact, the procedures to turn flax into linen used on the fibers of the main body of the shroud ceased circa 1000 CE. Thus a dispute about how much the sample area was “contaminated” as that word is commonly understood begs the question of how many new linen fibers were used to repair the frayed edge of the Shroud circa 1500 or so, Also, one huge point: the cotton fibers that Oxford found and discarded before the sample was destroyed were “yellow.” I have seen cotton fields in the US and I don’t recall seeing any yellow cotton just a lot of white balls of cotton natural in the fields. Linen does not dye well and Rogers thesis is that the yellow cotton strands were inter woven to give the fibers color that matched the aged kinen which was graudally darkening (light pollution anyone?) Rogers also conceded that the Maynard reaction was not an complete explanation of the image formation process. There was something else. I would point out in my inexpert opinion based upon my human observations, there is one source of radiation that can cause color changes without destroying its object. It’s called light. Museums must sometime guard their treasures against light pollution. When the Mona Lisa was subjected to multi spectral digital imaging, the company that did it had to use special light sources designed to safe guard the Mona Lisa from the light. “He was the light of the world, and the light shone in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend it.”.","date":"2015-04-25","mins":"7:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/23/look-at-what-happened-between-1988-and-2015/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Look at what happened between 1988 and 2015"},{"id":"comment-197592","author":"john_klotz","post":"Angel, Thanks for correcting me.

The following is an excerpt from my book that cites an item by Ian Wilson from the BSTS Newsletter published in 1990. “The first intimation of the dangling cotton thread came to the Shroud world in an article by Ian Wilson in the September October 1990 issue of the BSTS Newsletter entitled “Cotton On The Oxford Carbon Dating Sample: “Kindly brought to our attention by the Revd. Kim Dreisbach of Atlanta is a hitherto unnoticed report in the journal Textile Horizons of December 1988 concerning the Shroud sample supplied to the Oxford radiocarbon dating laboratory. Apparently the British company Precision Processes (Textiles) Ltd of Ambergate, Derbyshire was asked by the Oxford laboratory to help identify certain ‘foreign’ fibres observed, isolated and extracted from the Shroud sample prior to its destruction during the carbon dating process. “According to Precision Processes managing director, Peter South: “‘It was while the sample was undergoing tests at the radiocarbon acceleration unit in Oxford that Professor Edward Hall noticed two or three fibres which looked out of place. He mentioned this to his friend Sir James Spooner, chairman of Coats Viyella, to which our firm belongs. Consequently, after several telephone calls, the minute samples, which looked like human hair, were sent to us.’ “Magnified two hundred times by a Precision Processes microscope the fibres became immediately identified as cotton. This might have been explicable as merely from the cotton gloves worn by members of the STURP team in 1978, but for the subsequent information imparted by Peter South:” ‘The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old. Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ “This is not the first time that cotton strands have been identified on a Shroud sample. The Belgian Professor Gilbert Raes observed the same on the sample he studied in 1973, and he deduced that this was a strong indication of Middle Eastern manufacture. Clearly it could be of great interest to learn more both of the age of this cotton, and of the exact reason for its presence on the Shroud.” “BSTS Newsletter No. 26 – September/October 1990 (https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n26part6.pdf)” Please note the phrase “bound in.” This was not random surface contamination. And please note that Oxford knew this before the release of the carbon dating results. The red lights were flashing and the siren was blaring. For the labs to have stepped back a bit and dealt with this in their report would have resulted not only in a delay in a releasing their results and probably required a whole new sampling, something that would have virtually impossible to happen. In The Sign, de Wesselow wrote: “The carbon dating of the Shroud will probably go down in history as one of the greatest fiascos in the history of science. It would make an excellent case study for any sociologist interested in exploring the ways in which science is affected by professional biases, prejudices and ambitions, not to mention religious (and irreligious) beliefs.” “Fiasco” was a gross understatement.

On March 5, 2015 you posted the following to this blog thread: “Yes, confronted by John Klotz, Goodacre will presumably very easily find a number of experts in radio carbon dating who will tell him that there is no reason to doubt the dating (as I have they are around). “He will no doubt ask which of the critics of the dating who have confronted him have similar expertise. I can’t imagine that no one will refer him to the paper of Flury Lemberg which refutes Rogers after her close up examination of this corner of the Shroud, something never achieved by Marino or Benford. “Anyway no harm in John in trying.” To the very best of my knowledge your statement was factually incorrect. Flury Lemberg never examined the close up “this corner of the Shroud and her statement about that all the Shroud having the same content predated the carbon dating by two years. I would have no knowledge about your basis for that false statement. But others in this thread have pointed out the simple truth that she never had an opportunity to examine personally the pieces cut for carbon sampling. I would ask that you CITE AND QUOTE in this thread the specific authority upon which you rely in making your factual assertion. If she examined the photographs of the cut samples she is no better position than Benford Marino and the experts they consulted or Pam Moon and the expert she consulted who is cited in my Finding Jesus critique. There are pictures of the Oxford carbon sample taken before it was destroyed during the carbon dating process. A source for viewing that sample is cited in my Finding Jesus review. Also cited is Pam Moon’s article on the history of mending of the Shroud by Valtre. In the photograph that black threads. Pam explains their cognizance. Your first reference to Flury Lemberg is sufficient to justify my critique. But you did repeatedly refer to her in the thread. I have recounted the number of times you referred to Flury Lemberg in this context. The recount shows six times. Given the factual claim you made which was false, I do not believe that is a significant fact. It is, as they say, “de minimus.” My book has over 500 footnotes. The review of “Finding Jesus” published on Shroud.com is 14 pages with 31 footnotes. Included as to point in question is a reference to harry Gove’s memoir and an E Mail from Prof. William Meacham responding to an inquiry whether he recalled Fleury Lemberg making her statement in 1986 at the conference referenced by Gove. He confirmed that and then added his interchange with Al Adler. Now its time for me to compliment Professor Goodacre and I sent him a copy of it. I believed, that in fairness, I should inform him of my critique. His response – given my turgid review – was very professional and in good humor. He suggested that I comment on another blog which advocates the Shroud’s medieval fabrication. I checked the site and it appears that the author relied upon the claims of Walter Mc Crone. The blogger is ludicrous. If you would like, E Mail me and I would be send you a copy of my Chapter 9 (free of charge) which demonstrates that. The offer is open to anyone. I begin the Chapter 9 with a quotation from Revelations: “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” Buried in the chapter is a description drawn from Heller’s memoir of his actions upon returning from first post Turin STURP conference: “Saturday, he returned to work, put on his white lab coat and went down the hall to the microscope lab and repeated the examinations, this time using his favorite Leitz microscope.” I didn’t emphasize the relationship of that comment to the initial quote from Revelations hoping that readers would discover it for themselves. As far as I am concerned, the entire STURP team “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”.","date":"2015-04-04","mins":"7:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/05/mark-goodacre-answers-carbon-dating-questions-on-cnn-website/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Mark Goodacre Answers  Carbon Dating Questions on CNN Website"},{"id":"comment-192519","author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles, Would you care to name your anonymous experts and what they were basing their opinion on?

He also added an additional bon mot: that Adler at the same conference remarked to him that Flury Lemberg “obviously knew nothing about chemistry of the cloth.” Adler, incidentally, unlike you or I, actually had the opportunity to inspect an analyze fiber from the carbon sample area that had been held back by Turin when the carbon sample was cut and were supplied to him through the good graces of Prof. Gonella, the scientific advisor of the Turin Archbishop. That were later supplied to Ray Rogers. See http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlheimburgerpaper.pdf I have challenged you or anybody else to tell me when Flury Lemberg had an opportunity to physically examine the Shroud BEFORE the carbon samples were removed and destroyed and you haven’t done that. The evidence is she would have had no such opportunity. Also, I sincerely doubt she, unlike Pam Moon and linen expert Donna Campbell of the Thomas Ferguson firm, does not appear to have ever examined Oxford photograph. In fact, I am informed, and could be corrected, that Ms. Moon had to pry the photograph away from Oxford by the British equivalent of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. I will concede one point right now: the Campbell analysis does not state that repairs were made before 1355. For the existence of the Shroud before than we have to look for other sources. One of them is Flury Lemberg because I assume that you did not in any of your effusive praise for her intentionally overlook the fact that she asserts the authenticity of the Shroud. In fact she has identified stitching of the side seam of the Shroud as reflective of stitching seen in remnants from the Masada which would perforce be evidence of its existence circa 74 CE. In my CNN review, I also cite the evidence of the Shroud’s existence circa 500 CE; in exposition in Constantinople circa 1200 CE and its “fingerprints” seen in the Pray Manuscript circa 1200 CE. Is the evidence circumstantial, of course. However, Richard Dawkins, himself a Shroud skeptic, argues that circumstantial evidence is often more reliable than eyewitness accounts. Dawkins, Richard , pp. 15 16, 106, “Greatest Show on Earth,” Free Press. Kindle Edition. In fact. In my discussion in Chapter 1 of “Quantum Christ” (Rules of the Road) I demonstrated that from just two facts in the third verse of the Ira Gershwin lyrics to “I Can’t Get Started,” Gershwin was twitting i.e. “jerking the chain” of Joseph Kennedy, whose son John was later elected President of the United States. Finally, there is the excellent presentation in de Wesselow’s “The Sign.” As an agnostic he refuses to concede the realty of the Resurrection but as to authenticity of the Shroud, he has no doubt.

That is someone who claims to be seeking the truth, but is really seeking instead to prove his or her own prejudgment. Given the complexity of the fraud image, you can’t merely be putting up hypotheses with NO factual foundation and satisfy yourself you have succeeded in demonstrating anything. This is a fact: no one has demonstrated the process by which the image was created. No one has explained it scientifically. I expect that someday, long after you and I have shuffled off this mortal coil it may happen but it will be a process beyond our understanding, because it will be the Resurrection. I am sure that not only you, but many Christian believers, will scoff because they want to preserve the mysticism of their faith. However, let me quote Pierre Teilhard de Chardin again: “To outward appearance, the modern world was born of an anti religious movement: man becoming self sufficient and reason supplanting belief. Our generation and the two that preceded it have heard little but talk of the conflict between science and faith; indeed it seemed at one moment a foregone conclusion that the former was destined to take the place of the latter. But, as the tension is prolonged, the conflict visibly seems to need to be resolved in terms of an entirely different form of equilibrium — not in elimination, nor duality, but in synthesis. After close on two centuries of passionate struggles, neither science nor faith has succeeded in discrediting its adversary. On the contrary, it becomes obvious that neither can develop normally without the other. And the reason is simple: the same life animates both. Neither in its impetus nor its achievements can science go to its limits without becoming tinged with mysticism and charged with faith.” Teilhard, Pierre de Chardin; Huxley, Julian; Wall, Bernard (2011 06 21). The Phenomenon Of Man (Kindle Locations 5193 5200). Evergreen Books. Kindle Edition: This is where I part company with so many other who accept the Shroud’s authenticity. In the past two centuries science has pushed it’s knowledge so far and now is theorizing matters which intersect with the issue of the nature of human consciousness. Once again I recommend the Hameroff video who speaks of the quantum knowledge of the universe. I would not claim that Hameroff has everything right. But the implications of his claims which are grounded in science are immense and they are science. Beyond his theories lie not just the question of survival beyond death, but the Resurrection.

STURP also proposed that the C 14 test be concurrent with new tests to following up on its 1978 tests. In the end, the C 14 labs objected to anymore tests because the C 14 would determine if they were necessary. STURP was kicked out of the process altogether. The Labs argued that if the C 14 determined that the Shroud was medieval, then there wouldn’t be a need for further tests. I kid you not. Somebody should have smelled this a long way off but everybody was trusting the integrity of the labs. That was a huge mistake. As they say: “Trust but verify.” There was no verification by independent entities. That was a mistake. The protocols were violated from the very beginning.

Ray Rogers isn’t here to defend is work, and “frankly my dear, I don’t give a damn [about his inability to defend his work].” There are a number of subsidiary facts pointing to the invisible reweaving. That’s because as things now stand the creation of the image is subsidiary issue to the issue of authenticity of the Shroud. That, in my very humble opinion, has been demonstrated. The issue of its history in the lost years is also a subsidiary issue. The Shroud itself is proof of it’s authenticity. The fact that no one can replicate the image doesn’t detract from that and the fact that one theory or another about image creation is proven or dis proven EXCEPT to the extent that failure to account for it by known science or artistry supports the uniqueness and supernatural aura of the Shroud. The DEMONSTRATED physical facts of the Shroud support one rational conclusion: that it is the burial cloth of Jesus Christ. No alternative has been proposed except that there might have been some other individual crowned with thorns and crucified, his body was removed from his burial cloth with three days of his death. The probability of that the facts apply to someone else is so remote I can not count the zeros. The reason that probability is so small is that we have four accounts of Christ’s death based on oral and written traditions that state the facts of his death and none of anyone else dying in a like manner. His death was important enough to be noted by the Roman historian Tacitus who was aghast that Pontius Pilate had failed to eradicate the Christus superstition. However, the letters of St. Paul pre date Tacitus’ Annals of Ancient Rome. We now have three highly regarded scientists or academics trumpeting the need for no God and professing their belief that nothing preceded the Universe: Dawkins, Hawking and Krauss. Am I misquoting them? Sort of. Actually they do not so much as proclaim that “nothing” preceded the universe as proclaiming they don’t care about that “nothing.” Maybe I shouldn’t quote Martin Luther King but Bill Clinton: “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.” It depends on what the meaning of “nothing” is.

Are Brown photographs unreliable hearsay? Anything that you did not yourself witness is hearsay. The reports of the carbon labs are in themselves hearsay. You did not perform the tests you rely on what the labs wrote of their tests. That’s hearsay. If you have no time for hearsay you must be very disdainful of Richard Dawkins who in has even less trust in direct testimony: “The dictionary definition of a fact mentions ‘actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred’ (emphasis added). The implied pejorative of that ‘merely’ is a bit of a cheek. Careful inference can be more reliable than ‘actual observation’, however strongly our intuition protests at admitting it.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 15). Free Press. Kindle Edition. He continues: “Obviously, the vast majority of evolutionary change is invisible to direct eye witness observation. Most of it happened before we were born, and in any case it is usually too slow to be seen during an individual’s lifetime. The same is true of the relentless pulling apart of Africa and South America, which occurs, as we shall see in Chapter 9, too slowly for us to notice. With evolution, as with continental drift, inference after the event is all that is available to us, for the obvious reason that we don’t exist until after the event.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18) (pp. 15 16). Free Press. Kindle Edition. Then, Dawkins goes on to make an intriguing analogy: “We are like detectives who come on the scene after a crime has been committed. The murderer’s actions have vanished into the past. The detective has no hope of witnessing the actual crime with his own eyes. In any case, the gorilla suit experiment and others of its kind have taught us to mistrust our own eyes. What the detective does have is traces that remain, and there is a great deal to trust there. There are footprints, fingerprints (and nowadays DNA fingerprints too), bloodstains, letters, diaries. The world is the way the world should be if this and this history, but not that and that history, led up to the present.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 16). Free Press. Kindle Edition. Pardon me, but that is precisely the scientists other than the C 14 labs are doing in the study of the Shroud. The C 14 labs rely on one disputed fact: the C 14 tests of one corner of the Shroud. It is anomalous and all of your bloviating can not change that fact.

Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf In addition, after Roger’s death, a group of scientists at Los Alamos did further tests on the Raes fibers. And there is more. After Rogers ‘death, Barrie Schwortz contacted Robert Villarreal who had been given a Raes fiber by Rogers because he wanted a check on his work through an independent analysis. He hadn’t heard from Rogers but after Schwortz contacted him, Villarreal and his associates conducted a series of tests which the results of which they reported to the 2008 Ohio conference and later at the 2012 Valencia Conference. The Valencia report is reproduced at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf The Ohio report may be found here: http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm Med. Lemberg also stated that there was cotton throughout the Shroud I believe. However, other than transient cotton debris some of which may have come from the gloves of the STURP team, they could not find cotton on the parts they examined and were puzzled by Raes findings. Rogers had samples both Raes and the main body of he Shroud. They were different. Then there is the fact that prior to he release of the C14 results, Oxford was informed of the presence of interwoven cotton in a sample sent by Oxford to Precision Process. It was not transient debris. In the carbon 14 report of the C14 labs published in Nature, buried in the acknowledgements was the following: “Oxford thank P. H. South (Precision Process (Textiles) Ltd, Derby) for examining and identifying the cotton found on the shroud sample..” It was the only mention of cotton anywhere in the C14 Report. South, the head of Precision reported that cotton found on the Oxford sample was: ‘The cotton is a fine, dark yellow strand, possibly of Egyptian origin and quite old. Unfortunately it is impossible to say how it ended up on the Shroud, which is basically made from linen. It may have been used for repairs at some time in the past, or simply became bound in when the linen fabric was woven.’ You can of course choose whatever “expert” you want that agrees with your bias but the physical evidence that cotton as interwoven in the Raes and adjacent carbon sampling sites is there for your examination in the microphotos of Rogers and John Brown. There is no physical evidence of interwoven cotton in the main body of the Shroud. This is a rather long comment.

Freeman is an historian not a physicist. If someone wishes to challenge them, I don’t think it is too much to ask the basis of their challenge and what specific evidence beyond someone’s visual observation they are using. Too much science was done by first STURP and then Rogers and his associates to be simply be ignored because one person said I saw cotton throughout the Shroud. The evidence that Oxford was informed of the problem before the results were reported and then ignored the problem is quite clear. Freeman is an historian, not a scientist. I do not rely on my personal scientific knowledge but what I understand of the science done by the excellent and credentialed scientists who have actually dealt with the Shroud.

I have said on occasion, the real tragedy of Teilhard de Chardin is that the Church by directing him nor to publish during his life time, denied him the opportunity to have is ideas debated and rethought in light of criticism. Otherwise, without publication, we are to paraphrase LBJ, “hollering down a rain barrel. It may have escaped notice but I did offer a description of the bind we may be in as to authenticity. I indicated that Gonella was dead and ray was dead but that there was an intermediary who has refused to come forward. I am for now not at liberty to name him or her because I regard the conversation where I learned that as confidential and I can not betray that confidentiality. However, there is something that is not confidential at all. Unlike the Turin reaction to Fanti, Turin had a distinctly different reaction to Rogers peer reviewed 2005 article. Indeed, it rebuked one Turin personality who attacked Rogers and fond his article useful for future scientific investigation. One of the really important items on Shroud.com is a chronology of the C 14 controversy compiled by Joe Marino and Ed Prior. For anyone interested in the controversy it is a must read. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/chronology.pdf Item #37 concerns Rogers 2005 paper and the reaction to it. (pp.20 21) It relevant part (on page 21) covers the reaction to Rogers 2005 paper both here and abroad, particularly in Turin. First he was criticized by Msg. Ghiberti but the rebuttal to Ghiberti came, not from Rogers but “The Diocesan Commission for the Holy Shroud (in Turin)” “Physicist and artist Isabel Piczek wrote ―It is not good enough just to look (with the naked eye) for a re woven patch. It is an invisible reweave, which requires microscopic and microchemical analysis (to discover). Rogers‘ paper has to be accepted. New discoveries always cause lots of controversy, but (Roger‘s report) should be trusted because it was published in a peer reviewed journal (as cited by Muldoon, Shena. ―Was the Dating a Hoax?‖ Inside the Vatican, 13:2 [March 2005], pg. 25). Even after this data was released, Turin‘s Monsignor Giuseppe Ghiberti told an Italian newspaper, “I am astonished that an expert like Rogers could fall into so many inaccuracies in his article.” However, a short time after that, The Diocesan Commission for the Holy Shroud released another statement, saying that the study of Rogers was “very interesting” and would be the basis for a future study “on the chemical characteristics of the cloth and its possible inhomogeneity‖ (as cited in Muldoon, Shena. ―Was the Dating a Hoax?‖ Inside the Vatican, 13:2 [March 2005], pg. 25.) It cannot be emphasized enough that insofar as he was the only person to have access to main Shroud samples and samples from the C 14 sample area, Roger‘s judgment should carry enormous weight. To see Rogers‘ impressive resume, go to: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/rogersresume.pdf. From page 34, Rogers, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin (Barrie Schwortz, Colorado, 2008) (Available at Lulu.com): “The results of analyses on the Raes sample made it appear that the radiocarbon sample that was cut for dating in 1988 was not valid (Chapter IX). This naturally caused another controversy. The only way to settle the validity question was to obtain some threads from the authentic radiocarbon sample. However, in dealing with Shroud problems, every sample must be documented without any gaps. I finally received a documented sample of radiocarbon yarn segments, both warp and weft, on 12 December 2003. Professor Luigi Gonella had pulled these segments from “the center of the sample” in 1988 at the time of sampling. Their history was known from that date.” Schwortz was the “publisher” of Rogers posthumous book and, along with Rogers’ wife, was carrying out Rogers’ dying request. The words are Rogers’. From Thermacimica Acta “On 12 December 2003, I received samples of both warp and weft threads that Prof. Luigi Gonella had taken from the radiocarbon sample before it was distributed for dating. Gonella reported that he excised the threads from the center of the radiocarbon sample.” Please note, that in neither of these statements does Rogers say he received the threads “from” Gonella.” There is no evidence that Rogers received them without authorization. Indeed, the reaction of the Turin authorities, indicates that they were well aware of his source. Life would be simpler if the individual who was intermediary for this sample would come forward. Alas, life and the Shroud, are not simple. Time eventually runs out for us all..","date":"2013-03-31","mins":"6:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/30/res-ipsa-loquitur-the-facts-speak-for-themselves/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Res ipsa loquitur:  The facts speak for themselves."},{"id":"comment-33314","author":"john_klotz","post":"Henrietta Lacks and ASM carbon dating It may seem stretch but there is a connnection between the saga of Hnerietta Lacks and ASM carbon testing.

I spoke with him about trying to get the three labs to open up on their samples to see if they have a relationship to Ray Rogers findings.

The Hospital preserved some of her stem cells and they were replicated and became the source of a billions of dollars industry. Her stem cells have built sky scrappers. What did the estate of Henrietta Lacks get out of this: na da, nothing. The C 14 testing of the Shroud was an entirely different procedure and industry. Howver, we are being naive (as I was) in thinking the labs would ever take any steps to jeopardize the validity of their most famous case – the Shroud of Turin. There is too much money at stake. I am reminded in the story in the Gospel where Christ cured a women of possession but that the demons then went out an possessed a heard of swine which became enraged and stampeded over a cliff. The pig herders then drove Christ away. Salvation could wait, the money mattered more. I think that enormous progress has been made but the C 14 tests have not yet made it to the dust bin of history.

Those who who keep demanding that the Church yield the Shroud for investigation to sectarian authority, overlook the fact that the carbon labs have by and large been jealously guarding the remaining pieces of the samples in their position. Zurich appears to be hiding in the Alps. Oxford claims it has no hold back and only Arizona in 20012!!! has allowed inspection at all. Barrie’s photos are interesting and the cooperation initially shown by Jull promising. Now it appears to be withdrawn. Perhaps the academics and critics who direct so much fire at the Church and Turin should direct some of it at Arizona and Zurich (Oxford calims to have no samples remaining). Given the work of Rogers and now Fanti, their silence speaks volumes. The only right to silence in the US is for people accused of a crime. In the absent of that, the rule is a refusal to testify allows the furthest inference possible to be drawn from the evidence of the adversary. Even in complex federal litigation over patents there are procedures for revealing to the court and litigants all manner of claimed “trade secrets” when needed and relevant. Much of the procedure and findings of the labs has been shielded from review by critics. I am not in the position to marshal that criticism today. Perhaps someone else may have the complaints about the labs failing to fully disclose what happened at their finger tips. When I have a chance, I’ll dig it out but for now this controversy becomes a part of Chapter 10: The carbon dating fiasco. I am working on Chapter 12 now and have about four more to go. The evidence of the adversary that Shroud is the burial cloth a man crucified circa 30 CE hasn’t been hidden.

The problem is setting proper protocol for tests and reconciling the need for new tests with the issue of preservation. Also, what is the regime for the tests. There have been various reports of new non invasive procedures. We (at least I) need to be educated on these procedures. How good are they? Fanti claims to have dated the Shroud through application of a different procedure. His report of that as to the Shroud was formally peer reviewed and the provenance of is sample threads challenged. However it appears that a general report on the method was published in a peer reviewed journal without reference to the Shroud. Not that peer review is a guarantee of everything. Benford and Marino sought to publish their critique in Radio Carbon and the peer reviewed committee included people connected to the labs they were criticizing. Ideas that challenge the norm are often rejected out of hand. I will begin my section on Christ and the Quantum (I think) with the story of Hans Berger. Totally ridiculed he died an unhappy man. It’s ideas were weird and way out here. Rejected for decades by the scientific establishment. And by the way, he invented and developed one of the primary diagnostic tools of the twentieth century. Tease alert, if you want to know, look him up. There is also another issue: It’s been 25 years since the carbon dating. Surely the technology has advanced since then. I really hope that both the Turin and Ohio conferences will advance and educate on these issues. Maybe I will not be around by the time fruition comes. It might take years. Less than five I might just make it. Maybe if it takes ten, I’ll still be around. Twenty, in my nineties, who knows? But the relative urgency of my desire to know more, can’t short circuit the development of an new protocol for new testing. Carbon dating is only one method of examination. We can now study reactions down to the quantum level. Actually that’s what florescence is and the MRI.Science will hopefully get better not worse. I will make one statement you will probably disagree with. New carbon dating, unlike the 1988 dating MUST be in the context of a panoply of examination processes. That was another error of the 1988 testing, perhaps the basic error, the exclusion of other tests.

He sallied forth to do battle with English Jesuit Herbert Thurston and Beecher was a lively presence to the branch of his family who were in the US (as was his antipathy to Thurston). We are in the study and debate about the Shroud dealing with cosmic issues. By some “accident” of history, Barrie has become the leading of voice for the authenticity of the Shroud.

The findings of STURP were peer reviewed and published. For, let say, an art historian to cast doubt n those peer reviewed scientific findings without anything but his own in credulousness is an exercise in navel gazing. I believe that Richard Dawkins may have coined the phrase “argument from incredulity” to describe fundamentalists who reject evolution because they can’t believe it. He certainly used it. Blood was discovered on the Shroud. One of the processes used was multi spectral analysis. Initially it was identified as primate blood but further investigation it was determined to be human. As important to its identification as blood were invisible serum halos around the major stains, particularly the spear wound were detected. It would not have been possible or conceivable for a forger to do this without the use of real human blood. Heller asked medieval art experts whether they were aware of any artists who used blood and the universal answer was no. Perhaps Charles could enlighten us as to any medieval artist who used human blood and where we might find EXISTING examples that have survived from Medieval times. The blood on the Shroud exists today. Mc Crone came up with serial explanations for the “painting” of the blood all of which were conclusively rebutted buy the scientific analysis. This is one of the areas where science and history merge. The conclusions to be drawn have theological impact. It’s a triple header If there are any of the skeptics who refuse give credibility to the peer reviewed findings of STURP and the facts documented by photographs and other scientific devices and not just in their written reports, you’ll excuse me if my patience is exhausted.

The Shroud attests to the FACT that within three days of his crucifixion, the body of Jesus Christs parted company with his burial cloth. Science will some day explain that. The sum of the evidence for that fact is overwhelming. All that stands in the way is the blind faith that accepts the results of the carbon dating which Thomas de Wesselow tabbed a “fiasco” in “The Sign.” But de Wesselow than fantasizes that ALL the reported appearances of Christ post Resurrection were observations of the Shroud because his agnosticism can not accept the Resurrection. . Some scientists are already discovering that in quantum phenomenon there is an explanation of eternal life. Concepts such Teilhard’s noosphere and Jung’s collective unconsciousness are getting rolled into the concept of the quantum information of the universe. Stuart Hameroff and Nobelist Sir Roger Penrose hypothesize that the brain is quantum computer functioning through quantum entanglement – action at a distance. Einstein originally rejected entanglement as “spookie.” As predicted by Teilhard, science and faith are now converging and will run on parallel paths. Each will educate the other. Some are more comfortable with a blind faith. I prefer faith with eyes wide open. These are exciting times and right in the middle of it is the Shroud of Turin.

AT 17, I learned how to make a tesseract (a four dimensional analog of three dimensional cube). My interest in science is is more than seven decades old. Did you ever experiment with vinegar and baking powder in a corked bottle as a child? I got my first chemistry kit age 8 or thereabouts. Did you ever hear of Boltzman Brains? Just asking. By the way, there is no impertinence about asking for qualifications. But like the Shroud, Quantum Christ speaks for itself. I will post a piece on my blog in the next few days critiquing CNN’s Finding Jesus episode on the Shroud. Here’s a brief preview: “Teilhard de Chardin in The Phenomenon of Man anticipated a convergence of science and religion leading to a scientific analysis of the actions and direction of God in creating the existence that we know. Nowhere is that convergence more evident than in the study of the Shroud of Turin. There are a trio of intellectual disciplines that must be included in any analysis: Science, History and Theology. Any one who attempts to address the issue of the Shroud’s authenticity who doesn’t understand this trio is akin to one of the blind men describing an elephant: It’s a snake, no it’s a tree, no it’s a wall. “Anyone seeking to comment on the Shroud must not just nod to the trio, he or she must develop some understanding of each as it relates to the Shroud.

One of the places where it becomes relevant is in the issue of what are commonly referred to as paranormal phenomena. The scientists who study these phenomena are often derided by the main stream but the pehenomena are real. One example. During the Vietnam war, woman awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of a rifle shot. It was inexplicable in he normal course of events where she lived. She later learned that her husband had been killed in Vietnam and when she received details discovered that it happened by a rifle shot at the precise time she had been awakened in the night. I have a coleaugue who had been married but divorced. His ex wife moved to Florida. They had a dog who had passed away. One night he had dream about the dog had died. He came to him in the dream barking as if he should wake up and do something. His sense was that it involved his exwife. It was totally inexplicable. He called his ex wife the next day and asked if she was okay. She told him she was getting married that day. That marriage didn’t turn out well.. Then there is the case of Hans Berger Berger which I discuss in Chapter 15 of Quantum Christ: Consciousness, Evolution and the Genesis of Good and Evil ————————————————————————————————————— Who is right about human consciousness: the neo Newtonians or those who find consciousness to be a quantum phenomenon? Perhaps we should begin with the “incredible,” and ultimately tragic, saga of Hans Berger. C.Hans Berger and his magic machine Hans Berger was born May 21, 1873 in Neuses, a small Bavarian town that was eventually absorbed by the City of Coburg. He was the son of a well to do physician. His father’s wealth freed Berger from the day to day struggle of the less fortunate to just survive. He had interests, but no extraordinary ambition. Hans was not interested in pursuing a career in medicine and settled, initially, on a career in Astronomy. He enrolled as a mathematics student at the Fredrich Schiller University of Jena to prepare him for that career, but the pace of life in the city held no allure. He left college and began a year of military training to sort things out. It was while in the cavalry, that an incident occurred, that not only changed the course of his life, but the course of what we call neuroscience, the study of the nervous system, including the brain. One morning, he was thrown from his horse during a training exercise. He landed on the road in the path of a fast approaching team of horses pulling a heavy gun carriage. His thought was quite explicit: “I’m going to die.” Fortunately, the drivers of the gun carriage were able to rein in their team of horses and it stopped short of Berger. Shaken, but not injured, he returned to his exercise and his duties. That evening, when he returned to his quarters, he found a telegram from his father inquiring about his welfare. That morning, his sister had become quite hysterical because she felt that Hans had been in an accident and died. His father inquired anxiously if he was all right. Berger promptly responded but he was amazed that his sister had an attack of hysteria at the moment of his grave peril when he consciously thought he was about to die. It was a life changing moment for Hans Berger. His attention turned to neuroscience. He concluded that the brain must in some way think and process electromagnetic waves and that in some way his thought of his impending death had been transmitted to his sister with whom he had a close relationship. Needless to say, as he advanced in his study of neuroscience, contemporary colleagues were quite dubious and treated his ideas with derision. Undeterred, he developed a machine to measure “brain waves.” More derision, but in 1924, his machine began to achieve acceptance. It was dubbed the Electroencephalograph, the EEG, which was a breakthrough in the analysis and treatment of brain disorders. Berger’s life continued on a troubled plane. He never received what he regarded as his proper recognition. The next two decades would see the rise of Adolph Hitler and the Nazi party. There is some controversy about whether Berger was a Nazi collaborator. In any event, he retired from the University of Jena in 1939. In 1940, plagued by ill health and his failure to achieve what he regarded as his proper place in the scientific pantheon, he committed suicide. Today, there are research organizations in neuroscience that have either adopted his name or sponsor conferences in his name. The EEG, which was a scientific breakthrough of the first order, has been in some respects replaced by the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which allows analysis not only of the brain but the entire body or selected parts of it. Professors Bruce Rosenbaum and Fred Kuttner, of the University of California Santa Cruz, writing in The Quantum Enigma: Physics encounters Consciousness, claim that “One third of our economy” involves products based upon quantum mechanics and go on to describe four of them: the laser; CC Ds (charge coupled devices that, among other things record images in digital cameras); the transistor; and the MRI. The scope of these four devices that use quantum mechanical methods indicates the distinction between the reflective consciousness of humanity and the consciousness of all other life on earth. Mastering quantum mechanics is one of the greatest accomplishments of humanity’s reflective consciousness. Most importantly, that reflective consciousness is the reason we, as distinguished from all other forms of life on earth, are constrained in our actions by ethics and morality. All other living creatures answer to unfettered instinct. The natural world is a violent, nasty place. Is humanity different? If so, why? —————————————————————————————– There will be those who find precursor attributes in the animal kingdom such as empathy and perhaps even a kind of ethics. Also, animals clearly have access to quantum phenomena. The migration of birds is alleged to guided by access to the quantum. That is a debate that would lead us to far from the issue at hand. Some might argue about my description of Neo Newtonians as deterministic, This is probably not the place to debate those issues. There are others devoted to philosophy who made resent the intrusion of hard science into philosophical issues. I would also direct attention to the hypotheses of consciousness being advanced by former Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell who once co authored a piece with – gasp – Sue Benford. I do not adopt or advocate any of these necessarily. But there is a direction and of both science and religion and we are being pulled in that direction. I guess when push comes to shove I am a “Chardinist” (as in Teilhard de Chardin).

I would agree that the time is long past for further non intrusive scientific examination of the Shroud. The problem is that neither you nor I, nor apparently anybody else, can get Turin to budge. I believe there may be an element in the Church that prefers the Shroud remain a mystery. If the Shroud’s authenticity is established then it becomes no less than a Revelation with a capital R. We will know more about the real Jesus that at any time in history. Also, it will be an accessible revelation. There may be some in the Church who would prefer that not happen. Holy icon, yes. New Revelation, No. I am not sure about how Pope Francis would feel if he addressed the problem. He seems somewhat obsessed with serving the poor and downcast. I don’t know where he got that from. (I’m kidding, of course I know where as does any other Christian). In some circles, I am regarded as a liberal or worse. I like to say that I am slightly to the right of JC. The only person on this blog who is directly involved in organizing the St. Louis conference is Joe Marino. I expect he is reading this thread. Actually, I am some what excited by what people are writing. I think we owe a debt to Charles Freeman for kicking this off. Maybe a theme for the conference should be “What next?” Excuse me for mentioning STURP again, but it gained unprecedented access to the Shroud. It was a unique confluence of energy that caused that to happen. First and foremost, perhaps, was Father Peter Rinaldi who was an Turin born priest serving in the United States who in a figurative sense was the one who brought the shroud to America. Then there were was Silent Witness, the David Rolfe film based upon an concept by Ian Wilson. Then there was Ian’s first book. And, although it rubs my populist grain the wrong way, there was the exiled King of Italy, Umberto. And there was of course, John Jackson, who caught fire (almost literally) and with the help of Eric Jumper organized STURP. When you appreciate this confluence, you might add another factor and please don’t groan: the Holy Spirit. It’s enough to make one believe in the Trinity. It was and is a fantastic story.

I do not believe that your concept of a single lab no matter how well qualified taking possession of the Shroud for testing would fly. Although the sample selection for the carbon testing was flawed, the fact is that the three labs were supposed to test there samples and not consult about their results. That simplest part of the protocol was not honored, but the concept having three independent tests as a check on each other was a valid one. A single commercial investigator isn’t likely, particularly when the advocate of that approach can’t fit the conferences into his schedule. We all have choices to make. This summer, I put aside most of the time I intended to spend on Shroud because I had an eight year defamation case to try. My obligation to my client had to come first. (Incidentally, we won). To study the issues raised by the Shroud is a time consuming process. Maybe a book at the end of the trail may pay some compensation but that can be a long shot gamble. Very long. But I believe the mystery of the Shroud is worth the extraordinary time and effort it takes. I am reminded of the parable of the wealthy young man who approached Christ and said that he had been faithful to the commandments all his life. What more should he do to obtain salvation? Christ replied, “If you would be perfect, sell every thing you have, give the money to the poor and come and follow me.” The young man turned away, for he was very wealthy. [Quoted from memory.] I believe that the scientific study of the Shroud has been a revelation and the challenge of the Shroud compels something more than tea kettle experiments. The dialogue on this blog can be pretty contentious but I have to credit Colin Berry bringing something to my attention that I had over looked. That forensic pathologist Zugibe concluded among very many other things that the image showed sign that Christ may have suffered from Marfen’s syndrome. Actually, that was in an earlier work by Zugibe published in 1981 and his last work that I had did not discuss Marfan but cited two books that did in the bibliography. However, I now think it may be worth a deeper analysis. As noted by some, it might explain the fact that Christ’s relative quick expiration on the cross surprised Pilate. [The husband of my wife’s cousin died unexpectedly and it was suspected that he may have suffered from Marfan’s.] There is a comment in Martin Kemp’s “Christ to Coke” book on icons that comes to mind. I have to travel out the Mineola courthouse today, and I am, of course way behind on my manuscript, but I felt this digression is necessary. I wish you well, but a single commercial provider taking possession of the Shroud for tests isn’t going to happen.

The Shroud is unlike any other relic because if it is authentic it is both an artifact of Christ himself and a possible witness to the Resurrection.

I take my guidance from Teillhard in that regard who wrote that there is an inevitable conjunction of the two. Science has explained so much of what was once considered the province religion. It has now come to the edge of some intrinsically, cosmic, religious questions. I believe that science attempting to define human consciousness is science defining the soul.

And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.” Before the Big Bang there was no organization and the principal forms of existence and the laws of physics evolved in an incredibly brief instant, I have difficulty finding the definition of what existed prior to the Big Bang.

Those who believe that the “gift” of faith is what matters can sniff at them and they, like the Pharisee” in the parable, thank God they are not like others. I believe the Shroud is more than an relic or artifact, it is a revelation for our time that as been waiting two millennia for science to reveal its mysteries. In ancient times, some found faith through he preaching St. Paul. In our times, science may in fact be delivering the gift of faith to a faithless age. It is my opinion, it is not sufficient to sit back and tut tut all the faithless when there is at hand a miracle, but a miracle that is being revealed by science. That’s appropriate, because at the very beginning of human history, there was no dividing line between religion and science. The first scientists were the priests. Witness for example the complex, but brutal civilization of Maya’s which practiced human sacrifice. We may abhor their practices, but the same priests who offered up the sacrifices where the “scientists” who studied the stars and made incredible discoveries and predictions. Some the greatest “scientists” of medieval and Renaissance times were in fact priests and ministers. On my manuscript, I will give Teilhard a go. He was a Jesuit priest who was and anthropologist who foretold a convergence of science and religion. Do I think the Shroud is authentic? Yes. My belief and the Shroud are what we call a positive feed back. The Gospels, much maligned by Dawkins et al demonstrate the authenticity of the Shroud and the Shroud demonstrates the authenticity of the Gospels. The mystery of faith in Catholic Church until the recent, scatter brained change of it was : Christ has died, Christ has risen; Christ will come again. The Shroud authenticates the first two items, and be in at least a metaphorical or allegorical sense, the fullfilment of the final item.

For the past two years we have been celebrating day by day the 150th anniversary of events in the Civil War. This year is of course huge. There is the horrific Union loss at Chancellorsville followed by the turning point victories at Vicksburg and Gettysburg in July, followed by the Gettysburg address at which redefined our Nation, turning us toward the fundamental values of the Declaration of Independence. This is also the fiftieth anniversary of two events of the JFK presidency. The first was the June speech at American University in DC where he first publicly proposed a ban on the atmospheric testing of Atomic weapons. Both he and Khrushchev and looked into the abyss the previous year during he Cuban Missile Crisis and knew the desperate path the World was trodding toward nuclear anihilation. Kennedy’s speech is best remembered by this phrase about the need for Us Soviet cooperation: For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal. Kennedy lost the White House on November 22, 1963. There is substantial evidence that he did plan to pull of Viet Nam after the 1964 election and already had drafted an order to pull back our commitment. All that ended in Dallas, His successor gave the military industrial complex the war it wanted. Lincoln finally won is war in 1865. He visited vanquished Richmond but a week later he too was assassinated. I have come to believe the enduring truth of the Christian faith (or myth, if that suits you) is not the resurrection but its transfiguring of all human experience into the divine. Lincoln and Kennedy both enjoyed great triumphs before their assassins struck. The cheers in Dallas were still ringing in JFK’s ears when all went black. Today is Palm Sunday when Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the back of an ass. Cheers were ringing also n his ears. Then came the crucifixion and three days of black for his disciples. And then cam Easter morning and the witness of Mary Magdalene that some thing had marvelous had happened. Today is Palm Sunday and we can not forget even as we celebrate that Good Friday lies only five days in the future. But then two days more and it is Easter. I close with a quotation from Elaine Pagels, autyher of the Gnostic Gospels: “In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.” We in this generation are blessed with a new revelation: His Shroud which not only registers the fact of His crucifixion, but whispers the hope of His Resurrection (and ours),.","date":"2013-03-24","mins":"12:05 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/03/24/palm-sunday-jesus-triumphal-entry-into-jerusalem/","cat":"event","title":"Palm Sunday: Jesus’ Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem"},{"id":"comment-198764","author":"john_klotz","post":"Notice where and how the cleric in upper left hand corner of the photograph is gripping the Shroud..","date":"2015-05-10","mins":"6:17 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/10/picture-for-today-getting-ready-for-the-shroud-exhibition-in-1931/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Picture for Today:  Getting Ready for the Shroud Exhibition in 1931"},{"id":"comment-198765","author":"john_klotz","post":"OOPS right hand as viewed..","date":"2015-05-10","mins":"6:21 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/10/picture-for-today-getting-ready-for-the-shroud-exhibition-in-1931/","cat":"exhibition","title":"Picture for Today:  Getting Ready for the Shroud Exhibition in 1931"},{"id":"comment-33704","author":"john_klotz","post":"Lord save You (and me) from your friends.

Wells of the University of London in a number of books, including Did Jesus Exist? “Although Jesus probably” existed, reputable biblical scholars do not in general regard the New Testament (and obviously not the Old Testament) as a reliable record of what actually happened in history, and I shall not consider the Bible further as evidence for any kind of deity.” Notice that there is no logical flow to this at all, only the slick spiel of a used car salesman. His use of “probably” to modify existed means that there is doubt and he then jumps to a complete rejection of the Bible as any kind of deity.

As to the rest, many theologians, both Catholic and Protestant have views on scripture that may differ from you and me. St. John wrote that God is love and that is good enough for me. The generation before Christ, Rabbi Hillel was challenged by a gentile that he were convert to Judaism if Hillel could teach him all he needed to know about the Torah in the time Hillel could stand on one leg. Hillel replied: “Do not do unto others that which is distasteful to yourself. All the rest is commentary.” That was a very controversial statement by Hillel. His rivals claimed that there were 613 commandments of God, each one of which had to be obeyed to the letter, all were equally important. Christ was challenged by one of those who sought to trap Him by asking him “Which was the greatest commandment?” He replied (in words from the Torah) “to love God with your whole heart, mind and soul.” and then continued: “And the second is like unto this: To love your neighbor as yourself. Upon these two is are based all the law and the prophets.” In the parable of the Last Judgment (parable is Pope Benedict’s word) Christ tells us that the only measure is what we do for the least of God’s brethern.” It’s the one commandment of love. That’s a pretty big agenda right there. I believe that Science is not only proving the authenticity of the Shroud, but through quantum mechanics we are seeing the reality of love. I am sure that to some that may appear to be out there. But to me it’s in here. We are on the verge of a new Revelation through Science.

What a terrible burden it is for Dawkins to be the foremost atheist among the eight billion. That being said, when it comes to the slaughter of innocents in Canaan, I tend to agree with Dawkins that this was inexcusable barbarity. I remember watching a History Channel program on ancient generals two or three years ago which recorded Joshua’s slaughter of women and children in Jericho after “the walls came tumbling down.” I was appalled. When I discovered that Joshua was acting on a divine command, I decided that I could not worship such a God. I was deeply saddened when a Jewish friend of mine gave the human reasoning behind that. Leaving the women and children alive would have resulted in the leaving the seeds of idolatry to blossom and grow. That came to mind a year or so later, when on another History (or Military Channel rebroadcast) I heard a Himmler speech to the German Generals as the WWII ground to its close and the Third Reich was collapsing. “We had to kill the children,” he said, “because they would grow up to seek revenge upom us killing their parents.” Much of Bible is rationalization for human endeavors. Of course, that argues against it not being history. Some of its history is sad. But I highly recommend the direction of religions which is the basis of Richard Wright’s “The Evolution of God.” Jesus challenged the Pharisees” “What do you think of the Messiah [Christ}, whose son is he?” Wright is somewhat dismissive of the universality of Jesus message adopting the “Paul did it view.” But I think the last paragraph of his book sums up not only the direction of religious thought, but of Christianity itself: “Though we can no more conceive of God than we can conceive of an electron, believers can ascribe properties to God, somewhat as physicists ascribe properties to electrons. One of the more plausible such properties is love. And maybe, in this light, the argument for God is strengthened by love’s organic association with truth—by the fact, indeed, that at times these two properties almost blend into one. You might say that love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake, and that by partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine. Then again, you might not say that. The point is just you wouldn’t have to be crazy to say it.” * Amen, Mr. Wright, amen. *(Wright, Robert (2009 05 20). The Evolution of God. Little, Brown and Company).","date":"2012-04-01","mins":"7:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/03/31/speaking-of-issuing-challenges-to-dawkins/","cat":"event","title":"Speaking of issuing challenges to Dawkins"},{"id":"comment-31059","author":"john_klotz","post":"In the past two years, I have been fortunate to have had the friendship, and tutelage, of Barrie Schwortz.

The question is: how much should this bother us? While it would be a lot easier if we had warehouse receipts and shipping labels, we are never going to have in my opinion, a definitive provenance of the Shroud from the tomb to Constantinople and I doubt we will ever have a definitive provenance from Constantinople to Lirey. It does make for great debates though. Personally, I have a tendency to doubt the details of the Templar theory. The Templar’s have become the “usual suspects” of medieval history. While we may never know the complete provenance of the Shroud., we have learned a great deal. Most importantly in my view, we have two related physical facts: the blood stains and the image. Science has come a long way in unlocking these mysteries. It is definitely blood, but the nature of the mechanism that transferred the image from the body of tortured, crucified man to the Shroud remains a mystery. Science has gone along ways toward resolving the issue of the blood and identifying what the image is not: it was not created by any process we have been able to discern. Just as science has given us a definite answer to the blood issue (and it has), science may one day give us a definite solution to the image issue. I suspect that when it does, the answer will be the Resurrection. And unlike some, I like Teilhard, see science as an ally not an enemy of religion. I also believe that somewhere in the chaotic world of quantum mechanics will lie solutions to the many religious mysteries and the answers will not be bad for religion. I am reminded of Rabbi Hillel’s formulation of the Golden Rule and then adding: “Everything else is commentary.” As far as the provenance issue is concerned, solving the problem of image formation is paramount. Giving the impossibility of resolving the issues of where the Shroud was when it twice disappeared for literally hundreds of years is commentary. I have enormous respect for Ian Wilson and what he has done in his work on the Shroud. I don’t know if this is common knowledge, but it isn’t a secret. David Rolfe’s 1978 landmark “Silent Witness” began with a proposal by Ian Wilson circa 1974. Outside of that, I personally believe that Ian’s most important contribution, may be in bringing the Vignon markings to a greater audience. I also believe, as illusive as they may seem, the Vignon markings in art outside of the Shroud itself, are the most compelling evidence of the pre Constantinople provenance of the Shroud with the emergence of the markings as an artistic convention. I find this debate interesting, but I honestly believe that the pre Constantinople provenance of the Shroud has disappeared into the mists of time. But just like the bones of a dinosaur discovered today, the physical existence of the Shroud testify to its previous existence..","date":"2014-01-14","mins":"8:19 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/14/arculfus-shroud-a-guest-posting-by-o-k/","cat":"history","title":"Arculfus’ Shroud:  A Guest Posting by O.K."},{"id":"comment-73310","author":"john_klotz","post":"Thanks for the compliment and I agree in part.

That was two years and a lot of research ago. The six month time frame I gave my self is now going to be two years + but maybe Ash Wednesday and certainly by Holy Week 2014. I introduce this comment with that story, because horrors of horrors, I am now going to say something as a lawyer. The most complex thing of all is fraud. “Oh what tangled webs we weave, when first we practice to deceive.” By the way, I just this instant learned something. I would have though that line was from Bobby Burns, but it was from Sir Walter Scott. (he was Scottish too) During my career, I instigated or was principal instigator of several investigations for fraud. Two of them standout, one was an international financier who stole more than a billion dollars during the course of his career. I once said to his lawyer, that my client would settle its claims for two million dollars. He said “It’s hard to talk two million dollars with you when you are the one who put my client out business.” He hesitated and then continued on with obvious anger , “There is no question about it: Miami, Atlantic City, you are the one who put him out of business.” My response was unspoken: “From you lips to God’s ear.” I say that not to simply blow my horn but to indicate when I say that fraud, and the proof thereof, is a complex thing, I write from some experience. Incidentally, a former FBI agent who has been in the international news this week once told me over breakfast in Miami. “It’s pleasure to help you. I know who you are what you have meant to the Bronx. In his memoir of the Shroud, John Heller who was advised by Einstein when he was an undergraduate at Yale introduced me to the “gededenkenexperiment.” (thought experiment). That means to think through a proposition taking into all the knowns and applying science to them. The great ting about the gededenkenexperiment, Einstein told his young student, “it doesn’t require much of a budget.” Heller and Adler conducted a gededenkenexperiment on forging the Shroud, they ended up painting with a 12 foot or so paint brush looking through a telescope as they painted with a brush whose hair was a hundredth or so finer than any ever manufactured. When you say the Resurrection is the most complex of all explanations you are betraying not a scientific fact but an existing bias. Marcello Truzzi who was one of the founders of Center for Skeptical Inquiry quit after a couple of years because he discovered that most of his colleagues were not interested in the dispassionate search for truth but only to validate pre existing assumptions such as there is no God and no miracles. My point is simple. If you eliminate the possibility of the Resurrection, you are going to come up with proposed solutions which are all false and really, more complex than the Resurrection. The Shroud is the artifact of the transformation of Christ’s body into another form. We have yet to ken the process. My belief is that it is a whole lot simpler than forgery or inventing photography four centuries ahead of time or using a crucifix to produce a bas relief. This comment is a little longer than it probably should be. I really appreciate the chance of using the blog as a sounding board before a critical audience. But his morning I arose to wrap the last few presents. We celebrate the birth of Christ whose birth transfigured human nature. But as we contemplate that transformation we must recall, the horrible death that awaited him 33 years in the future. Isabel Pizcek has called the Shroud an “event horizon.” I happen to agree, as I shall explain. Hopefully before Easter. My favorite Christmas carol has a line that I think sums up the joy of the day to me and I think everyone whether they realize or not: “Long lay the world, in sin and error pining, till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.” Merry Christmas.","date":"2013-12-25","mins":"8:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/12/23/did-the-apostles-notice-an-image-on-the-cloth/","cat":"history","title":"Did the Apostles Notice an Image on the Cloth?"},{"id":"comment-101275","author":"john_klotz","post":"There are four accounts that generally concur in describing the crucifixion of Jesus.

Paul wrote his epistles circa 50 CE which was only three decades after the crucifixion. And the there is Roman historian Tacitus who wrote later than St. Paul but described the persecutions of Christians by Nero and the reasons for it. Essentially he despised Christians and Christianity as any self respecting Roman noble would: From Chapter Two of my manuscript: “Writing nearly 80 years after the death of Jesus Christ, he [Tacitus] leaves little doubt, that from the pagan Roman perspective, there was in fact a Christ, he was in fact executed, and the cult that surrounded him did not end with his death but survived and flourished. “The occasion for Tacitus’ reference to Christ and Christians was the aftermath of a fire during the regime of Nero that destroyed much of Rome. To counteract rumors that Nero, himself, was responsible for the fire, he blamed the burgeoning Christian sect in Rome and commenced a pervasive, sadistic persecution of the Christians: “’Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.’ “John Meier finds that the Tacitus report in Annals is authentic and not a Christian forgery.” Ostrich like agnostics and atheists can stick their head in the sand is they prefer.

There is an enormous amount of literature on the subject and one book that’ available on Kindle is the last one by forensic pathologist, the lat Fred Zugibe. The interesting ting is that Zugibe differs from Bucklin and other pathologists on the way the mechanism of crucifixion cause death. However, here seems to be a consensus that the image shows a state of rigor mortis and that as Zugibe explains, the movement of the arms to the position demonstrates the “breaking of the rigor mortis. As to Baden, he is the forensic pathologists of choice for elites dealing with uncomfortable questions. For example, he testified in favor of the “lone gunman theory” of the JFK assassination. There is significant evidence testified to by other pathologists that the wounds to JFK’s head were not caused by a single billet from the back of JFK. Among those who held that opinion was(is) Cyril Wecht. The issue with Baden is how much time did Baden actually spend on examining the Shroud and where did he publish? I would like to know. Is he a member of Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) which has been dedicated to disproving claims of paranormal events.

In any event, some excerpts from Zugibe’s final book. “If a person is in complete rigor mortis, the only way to change the position of a limb at a joint is to break the rigor, a term referring to the forcible bending of a limb at any joint. For example, if an elbow is in rigor mortis and bent to an angle of 45 degrees, straightening the arm is possible by forcibly straightening it. The greater the muscular development, the greater the force required to break the rigor.” * * * “This fact has medico legal significance to determine if a body has been moved after rigor mortis set in. For example, if a body was found lying flat with the legs suspended in the air, it would be immediately obvious that the body was moved from a position where the legs were resting on something.” Frederick T.

First came the blood stains and then as much as 48 hours latter, likely no more than, 40 hours, the image came into existence by a yet unknown process. Trying to create a unified picture of blood and the image can only go so far. Yes there are blood stains in positions consistent with the image. That doesn’t mean they were created simultaneously.. If the image was created an instant when the body and the Shroud “parted company” then it is clear the blood stains were, to borrow a phrase from our fundamentalist brothers and sisters, “Left behind.” Because of writing I have been dealing with multispectral digital imaging (MSDI) for a couple of weeks. Of weeks. I think it may very well be that with MSDI we can strip away layers of accretions from the Shroud and get a definitive picture of the Shroud even before there were any markings on it.; the markings at the time Christ was first wrapped in the Shroud and the markings when the image was created.

What I don’t have time are issues that are clearly leading up blind alleys and may in fact be planted as deliberate distractions. I believe that Jacques De Molay and Leonardo da Vinci when it comes to the shroud are distractions. It is time for them when it comes to the shroud to be assigned to the dustbin of history. I also have a feeling that the propagators of these theories may be distracting us on purpose. De Molay and Leonardo and become “usual suspects of mystery.” That’s a paraphrase of one of the widely quoted lines from the movie Casablanca. Inspector Renault (Claud Rains) having just witnessed Rick (Humphrey Bogart) shoot SS Major Strasser, says to a car full of his policemen that pulls up: “Major Strasser has been shot, round up the usual suspects.” It today’s parlance, one might say that line has become viral. For someone to gain attention, it’s always great to say the Templars, or Jacques de Molay and Leondardo did it. It’s always good for some attention and some book sales. But it is a distraction. Leonardo did not photograph the Shroud and De Molay who was roasted on a spit and then burned at the stake is not the man in the Shroud. My concern is that the proponents of these theories have their own agenda besides just making a few bucks or pound sterling. They want to distract us from the fundamental truth that Jesus Christ existed and that he suffered a horrible death. His crime was to preach love and, to many, his Resurrection gives courage to persevere in love no matter what the cost.

Neither you nor I possess their medical qualifications. We do possess a library card or access to the web. The does not make us expert in this SPECIFIC case. I believe based upon your posts that there is no evidence you will accept supporting authenticity of the Shroud. One thing your pseudo skepticism has done is produce some interesting and relevant posts from individuals with experience in the medical field. That’s a plus. The only support you have is a statement from Michael Baden who was fired as NYC Medical examiner by Ed Koch. I did 10 seconds of research on this for this post because I came across an entry, which for people on this side of the Pond says it all: “He is also the Forensic Science Contributor for Fox News Channel.” There have been surveys that have found Fox News viewers to be the most ill informed class of Americans. Others have pointed out the inconclusive nature of his opinion. Against the weight of authority cited by Dan Porter and the very informative posts in this thread from individuals trained in medicine and one with hands on EMT experienced dealing with trauma victims, you can only cite “I read a book” and the books you cite have nothing to do with the crucifixion of the Man in the Shroud as far as I can tell.

Charles Freeman is one person with a definition. His limited definition is how the term first came into parlance. However, on this side of the Atlantic we have a great deal of back and forth about the nature of skepticism and one the prime philosophers of skepticism is Marcelo Truzzi. You can read an essay of his on skepticism at http://www.anomalist.com/commentaries/pseudo.html Truzzi is deceased so i assume everybody so minded can pile on him in safety. However, there is one statement that appears to have originated with him that is communally attributed to Carl Sagan who uttered it on TV some years after Trunzi first wrote it: “Exceptional claims demand exceptional evidence.” Someone told me that the statement sprang f=rom the work of the English philosopher Hume although I have not investigated it further than the Truzzi quote. I think when it comes to the Shroud the issue is, given the evidence, what is the exceptional claim? Authenticity or in authenticity. Once you understand the facts that defeat the carbon dating, you might very well argue, that based on all the facts, the exceptional claim is in authenticity.

The Lumiere study of the Mona Lisa was more than 25 years later. The science of multispectral digital imaging had advanced. The Lumiere system measured composition across the complete light spectra from invisible infrared to invisible ultraviolet. A comparison of the Luimiere process to the Quad Mosaics is like comparing a 2015 Rolls Royce to a 1917 Model T Ford. An explanation of the process of the Quad Mosaics’ creation can be found at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/quad.pdf. While I referred to the three spectra as R/G/B, the article by Barrie Schwortz reverses the three spectra as B/G/R. That being noted, you had another complaint about the Quad Mosaics has evidence of repair because other corners of the Shroud also showed a marked bluish color. We now know why thanks to the publication of a history of the Savoy family’s guardianship of the Shroud that the Savoy’s gifted favored individuals with a fiber of the Shroud sometimes contained in small elaborate reliquaries which were themselves works of art. A copy of the Shroud with fibers from the Shroud embedded at its corners apparently was given to the Portuguese Royal Family on the occasion of a Savoy princess’s marriage to the Portuguese king. See http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/fatima2011.pdf For documentation of the fact that the Oxford sample was from an apparently anomalous portion of the Shroud see: http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud of Turin exhibition/Thomas Ferguson files/Updated report on the Consideration to the Uniformity and Effects of the Fabric in the Shroud of Turin 5 1.pdf http://www.shroudofturinexhibition.com/Shroud of Turin exhibition/Three threads files/BL%20 Sebastian%20for%20website%201.pdf In sum, the 1978 Quad Mosaics were in fact the result of an examination of the spectra of the Shroud using three filters B/G/R. There is evidence that samples of the Shroud cut primarily from the frayed corners were gifted by the Savoy’s to those royal houses and individuals it favored. I would think that you would agree that a carefully conducted, non intrusive multi spectral digital image examination of the Shroud conducted to standards such as those used by Lumiere would be of enormous value, not just to scientists, but to history..","date":"2015-08-02","mins":"8:22 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/08/01/remembering-an-earlier-posting-about-the-seamless-robe/","cat":"history","title":"Remembering an Earlier Posting About The Seamless Robe"},{"id":"comment-14647","author":"john_klotz","post":"I do not believe that this is “off topic” because the issue goes to the heart of existence both before and after the big bang.

I think the bias against science as a grounds for faith expressed by some represents a misunderstanding of where science is heading. Scientific and philosophical determinism dominated science until the beginning of he 20th century when the incongruities of quantum mechanics revealed destroyed the basic assumptions of determinism and revealed realty to be conscious driven and devoid of “common sense.” The Determinists included Newton, Darwin, Freud, Marx and Adam Smith. The end result was that free will was discarded as a myth and we acted in accordance with a myriad of circumstances that determined our action. The seeds of quantum mechanics were planted around the turn of the twentieth century, at the same time that science through Pia’s photography demonstrated the image on the Shroud to be the image of a tortured and crucified man who could only be Jesus Christ. The complaint about the Shroud is that it lacks “provenance” – a demonstrated history. But the physical facts of the Shroud demonstrate through scientific examination establish its authenticity. When one places the collapse of determinism that is intrinsic in quantum mechanics along the side the development of Shroud Science, the question arises is not provenance, but providence.

How probable is it that two items would have the same identical points? There comes a point when the circumstances are sufficient to change the burden of proof. That is, the burden is on the skeptic to offer facts that contradict the conclusion, not simply hypothesize as to what could be. This is the problem of the Shroud deniers. Once you establish the points of similarity to the Gospel accounts, taking into account the variances in the four Gospels, it is not enough to say maybe it was someone else. You have to answer if not him, who? As far as the Pray Codex is concerned, we have several points of comparison. It is clearly a shroud.

In his introduction Freeman states that “I decided to leave out the Shroud of Turin. Relic cults come and go and the Turin Shroud is very much a cult of the past fifty years, not a medieval one.” That is an incredible statement. Let’s assume that we are all wrong, let’s assume that the Shroud is a hoax (It isn’t, but lets’s assume that, as they say, arguendo.) How then to explain the badge at the Clony Museum in Paris or the paintings of the Shroud and its exposition to thousands prior to the Pia photograph of 1898. (More than 50 years ago assuming my math is accurate.) Medieval artist did indeed copy it and certain artistic conventions that appear on the Justinian coins, for example indicate they came from the Shroud image. (Check the “V” forelock) The contention that Freeman ignored the Shroud because it wasn’t a medieval cult is pure baloney. He ignored because he can’t deal with it as a object of scientific inquiry. The Shroud is a real object existing in this time and this place. It has been subjected to more than a quarter million hours of scientific investigation. Art historians like Freeman are on the wrong track because whatever the Shroud is, it is not a painting and it is not art. The answers lie in science. But it is a challenge as the errant carbon dating shows. Even science can lie. But the discussion must be of science. I have enormous respect for Ian Wilson and the contributions he has made.

But your fixation on de Molay and your disdain for Rogers (his pique) leads me to ask it: Were you ever a member of the Order of de Molay? or any other organization dedicated to his memory. There are skeptics of the Shroud who unfairly, and inaccurately , depicted STURP as a band of fanatic Christian soldiers. There were many Christians on the STURP team. There were also Jews, agnostics and perhaps some atheists. Thus that attribution was wrong. However, were the member of STURP all been Christian fanatics, or Opus Deii members, that would be a legitimate question of whether their Christian fanaticism colored their science. I will confess, I am a Roman Catholic although I’m not so sure of the Roman part sometimes. I guess I am like Pope Francis: A Vatican Council Catholic, The Pope has described himself a Vatican Council priest. It is a fair question when challenging me that I am Catholic. It also a fair question to ask a skeptic challenging the Shroud whether he is an atheist. Neither atheism nor Catholicism should disqualify any one from studying and discussing the Shroud and its science. But when someone comes off the wall, such as describing the Lirey badge as a hidden tribute to Jacques de Molay, it is a fair question to ask if he was a member of the Order of de Molay and perhaps had access to information not generally shared with the public.

Were I be asked if I were a member of Opus Dei, I would also deny it. Not because membership in any of the three organizations is a disqualification but membership in any one of the three might define my sense of the Catholic Church. I am not been a member of any of the three, by the way. Honestly, Colin, there is only one other person who I ever had a discussion with on de Molay that I can recall. It was in college and I spotted a pin on one of colleagues lapel. I asked him what it was for and he said the Order of de Molay. I asked who he was and he explained it was a Masonic youth order and de Molay was a martyr to free speech. I put that into my mental file and forget folder along with the Rosicrucians who advertised in the back pages of magazines such as Popular Science. The alleged assassin of Robert Kennedy was identified as having dabbled with a Rosicrucian society and that led me on a trail that wound up with Holy Blood, Holy Grail (HBHG). It was an interesting read but as I do with most conspiracy books I ignored the principle premise of the book (an obscure Frenchman was a blood descendant of Jesus Christ and was seeking to institute a new really European Empire) and concentrate on the verifiable facts reported. It was an interesting read on the history and I was fascinated by the fact that Madame Calve, the prima diva her time was supposed to be a member of the Pre de Sion, the uber conspiracy that ruled the world. Madame Calve in the nibneteen twenties had invited my Aunt Pauline, a very great soprano to come to Paris and be her protégé. She didn’t and her story can be found at http://www.johnklotz.com/billy.htm along with some other family history. The grain of salt I took about the Priory of Sion was big enough to choke a horse. Dan Brown used the allegations of HBHG as the inspiration of his “The da Vinci Code” and believe it or not, one of the writers of HBHG was also one of the writers of “The Silent Witness.” That doesn’t make HBHG true or Silent Witness false. Each work must stand on its own. Bottom line, I am a little more knowledgeable about Jacques de Molay than I was 55 years ago. I guess CB, you are afraid to give an honest answer to the question. If you weren’t so defensive, maybe we could get a new insight. “There might be giants” and there might be conspiracies. Of the two, conspiracies might be more probable.

She said: “What are they going to do in the freezing cold of Hell, that’s right the freezing cold of Hell.” That was 1949. I have to appreciate the nuns who gave their lives to the Church and wound up teaching ingrates like me, But when I was active in community organization and politics in the Bronx some years later many of the nuns were already right on activists. I got one of them in trouble with the Chancery, I was handling New York issues for the Fred Harris in 1975 1976 Presidential Campaign and I asked Sister Pat if she wanted to be a candidate for delegate to the Democratic National Convention. When Mickey Carrol of the NY Times was doing a series of articles on delegate selection, he called her because it thought it would be a good story tracking a select few candidates for delegate and he (a good Irishman) thought sister Pat would be a good story. He asked her how she got to be a delegate and she replied (and he printed in the Times) John klotz called me and asked I wanted to be a candidate.” That was in the morning edition of the Times and by the afternoon the Chancery had ordered her out of the race.

And you’re right, Hell can be freezing cold, except maybe we don’t really know what Hell is.

Also, in the brief synopsis you don’t make some obvious connections. One of the things as a youngster I found confusing is how we label a century a year after its calendar dates. The “eighteenth century” is circa 1700 1799. The twentieth century was 1900 to 1999 and the 21st century is our current epoch. I make this aside because the date of the decorative panels of the chest means that the whole chest can be traced to 1300 1399, encompassing the precise period of the first public exposition of the Shroud in 1355 and its “vagabond travels” in the 14th 15th centuries including a stop at the de la Roche castle. In Quantum Christ on page 37 I have the following footnote: “5 The best evidence is that the Shroud was a part of the booty that was seized by French knights who participated in the sack of Constantinople in 1204 during the abortive Fourth Crusade. Ian Wilson has postulated that it became the property of the Knights Templar. Others postulate that it became the property of Othon de la Roche, a French knight who became Duke of Athens as a reward for outstanding services during the Constantinople sack. De La Roche was the great grandfather of Jeanne de Vergy, Geoffrey’s wife. See the note by Cesar Barta,” Orthon de la Roche” BSTS News Letter, October 5, 2008 (http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/n67part6.pdf). If true, when Geoffrey I’s (and Jeanne de Vergy’s) daughter married Ortho de la Roche’s great grandson (reinforcing the blood line ownership of the Shroud) and then moved the Shroud to the de la Roche castle, the Shroud was returned to a previous home.” [These facts were brought to my attention by Annette Cloutier] It definitely appears that the Shroud was in the De la Roche castle and it is no surprise that they would have made a suitable chest for its storage. Because of the fact that the Shroud was in constant motion during this period of time it makes sense that the original chest which brought the Shroud from Constantinople to France would have become a bit shop worn and needed replacement. But the bottom was preserved. Is this proof of anything? Not conclusive perhaps, but the claims of the De La Roche heirs as represented in the pedigree of the Chest are consistent with known facts..","date":"2015-11-08","mins":"6:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/11/08/what-am-i-missing/","cat":"history","title":"What am I missing?"},{"id":"comment-214385","author":"john_klotz","post":"Our knowledge of the Shroud’s vagabond ways before it became the property of the House of Savoy comes from the meticulous research of Ian Wilson.

The Shroud’s near misses with oblivion including at least three times barely escaping consumption by fire may not be “miraculous” but is certainly “providential.” And now we have a narrow escape from Nazis that were hunting for it. But the most important sign of providence is that it waited for science to catch up with it. Pia’s photographs were only a relatively crude overture to the depth of the quantum examinations of STURP. Now even more vastly improved measurement devices functioning at the quantum level are available. And we are being hit with circumstances apparently unrelated that are focusing attention on the Shroud. Certainly any reference to the Shroud will in Rosenberg’s diary will be a big, big story. Yet, it will only be a part of an inexorable tide of interest that is sweeping across the world. In Thus Spake Zarathustra, Friedrich Nietzsche celebrated the death of God. It had happened in the extreme end of the Universe but the news was traveling to the world. Nietzsche wrote in the Nineteenth Century. The news arrived not with a bang, but many bangs in the Twentieth Century.

Colin by creating a scorch from a three dimension object has shown that it will have similar properties to the Shroud. As they say in Yiddish: Neu? [So?] I am not Jewish but 45 years in the Bronx will gives you an appreciation of Yiddish. His example is interesting but it represents the difference in distance as difference in color. The Shroud, like his scorch is monochromatic – a single color. The three dimensional representation that appears in the VP 8 is not caused by a difference in color but a difference in intensity or density of the image. Color (place on the spectrum of light) is different from intensity. Actually, Colin is about where Ray Rogers was. Rogers maillard reaction is a kind of scorch at low temperature but he realized that it wasn’t enough. There is that troublesome presence of real unscorched blood on the Shroud. Life is simple if you can accept the carbon dating tests. But, I submit, particularly after the Pam Moon presentation at St. Louis of the paper on the Oxford sample, that you can’t. Merely calling people like Wesselow or Heller or Adler names, doesn’t due the trick. De Wesselow was trained at the Courtlandt Institute. John Heller had amazing credentials including be chosen by Yale to be advised by Einstein at Princeton when he he was an undergraduate at Yale. Adler was Jewish. Yet, how often are the STURP scientists denigrated as Christian fanatics. The differences in intensity (density) of the image was noted by Vignon were the reason for his “action at a distance” theory. Sorry Dan, but once you understand that the image of the Shroud is monochromatic, you are back to action at a distance caused by a variation of image intensity, not color. Brightness is a function of intensity or density of the image. So too is “darkness.” Indeed, my scientific adviser referred to the VP 8 as a darkness map. (Ph.D. Carnegie Mellon, Emeritus University of Florida, Gainsville and a career studying writing about lasers, i.e. Light) He was also impressed by the scholarship of the STURP paper by Jackson, Jumper et al on the nature of the image.

Also, Wilson published then in his 2010 book, the Shroud. Setti Levis used a scanning ion microprobe with which the wavelengths emitted by the two different samples could be readily compared. Ian Wilson (2010 03 20). The Shroud (Kindle Location 1401). Transworld Digital. Kindle Edition. I may have overstated about the uniqueness of the aragonite to Jerusalem except that it is there and it’s not everywhere. But its on the sole of a foot, his knee and nose and that is compatible with the story of his falling while carrying the cross. What are the odds that a medieval forger would use aragonite dust on his masterpiece of fraud that just happened to match the aragonite in Jerusalem. The point of circumstantial evidence is that no single item may determine the issue but an accumulation of circumstances can lead to a virtually unerring conclusion. I give you quotations I use from Richard Dawkins, the “Atheist Pope” in my manuscript: As a result, Dawkins finds more reliable are inferences drawn from facts; in contrast to the dictionary, he places little weight in eyewitness testimony. “The dictionary definition of a fact mentions ‘actual observation or authentic testimony, as opposed to what is merely inferred’ (emphasis added). The implied pejorative of that ‘merely’ is a bit of a cheek. Careful inference can be more reliable than ‘actual observation’, however strongly our intuition protests at admitting it.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 15). Free Press. Kindle Edition. Given the fact that in his study of evolution, Dawkins most often deals with ancient artifacts, and there is a paucity of other evidence available other than the artifacts, it makes sense. “Obviously, the vast majority of evolutionary change is invisible to direct eye witness observation. Most of it happened before we were born, and in any case it is usually too slow to be seen during an individual’s lifetime. The same is true of the relentless pulling apart of Africa and South America, which occurs, as we shall see in Chapter 9, too slowly for us to notice. With evolution, as with continental drift, inference after the event is all that is available to us, for the obvious reason that we don’t exist until after the event.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18) (pp. 15 16). Free Press. Kindle Edition. Then, Dawkins goes on to make an intriguing analogy: “We are like detectives who come on the scene after a crime has been committed. The murderer’s actions have vanished into the past. The detective has no hope of witnessing the actual crime with his own eyes. In any case, the gorilla suit experiment and others of its kind have taught us to mistrust our own eyes. What the detective does have is traces that remain, and there is a great deal to trust there. There are footprints, fingerprints (and nowadays DNA fingerprints too), bloodstains, letters, diaries. The world is the way the world should be if this and this history, but not that and that history, led up to the present.” Dawkins, Richard (2009 09 18). The Greatest Show on Earth (p. 16).

The Incarnation of the Word as a human came later. Except perhaps for Psalm of course: “Before the Day star I begot thee.” Ancients probably read that as the Sun. I read it as the Big Bang. It is not until the 14th verse of John, after a digression on John the Baptist, that we read “and the Word was made flesh.” I want to emphasize that quantum mechanics is knocking on the door of this mystery. Scientists now write of a quantum fluctuation creating by (or being) a singularity that began the Universe and the resultant the laws of physics that govern “our” universe and empowered the evolution of life.

Even if someone could create a fake Shroud using your theory, that would not prove that the Shroud is a fake. There is a rather famous case in American jurisprudence about a high State Department official Alger Hiss who passed on documents to the Soviets in the 1930’s. His wife retyped them on a Woodstock typewriter. There was expert witness that the documents which were retyped on a specific Woodstock typewriter owned by Hiss because of certain anomalies in the type faces. After Hiss was convicted, during the defense hired a typewriter expert, Martin Tytell to duplicate the typewriter with the same tell tale anomalies. It took two years but he finally did it. Except the evidence was rejected. The fact that the government could have created a fake Woodstock didn’t mean the government did create a fake Woodstock. Assume you are right, that someone could have used the method you suggest. That doesn’t mean that someone did use it. And you still have not solved the whole issue of the blood stains. You may believe that the authenticity of the Shroud has not been proven, but to prove it was inauthentic requires something more than proof it might have been faked. Of course that’s where the carbon dating comes in. If you accept that, then it’s clear that the Shroud is a fake. But, I believe that the carbon dating has been impeached and assigned to the “dust bin of history.” Hiss partisans will know where that quote comes from.

I am not prepared to go much further into this at this time since I am dealing with the C 14 aspects and awaiting a copy of David Sox’s 1981 book. I already have his 1988 book. Sox played an interesting role in the C 14 process and instigated the C 14 labs to push STURP out (not that they needed much encouragement.) In any event, I find Adler’s account interesting. I think I learned something. But when it comes to a “natural” explanation of the image on fall back to Heller: “We do know, however, that there are thousands upon thousands of pieces of funerary linen going back two millennia before Christ and another huge number of linens of Coptic Christian burials. On none of these is there any image of any kind. A few have some blood and stains on them, but no image.” Heller, Report on the Shroud of Turin I do not believe that any image explanation advanced thus far employing a “natural” process can account for the resolution of the Shroud. Almost all of them would result in diffusion of some kind and that would have prevented the finely detailed image. I will be returning to this issue. What I am “playing” with is this concept: If you apply Occam’s razor, you may discover that the simplest explanation is the Resurrection. To simply reject it, is perhaps what Richard Dawkins has dubbed “an Argument from Personal Incredulity:” Just because you can’t believe it doesn’t mean it isn’t so.

We do not order our lives by reasonable doubt, but I believe the doubt as to the Shroud’s authenticity and the Resurrection is arguably unreasonable. Faith not founded on fact is not faith but superstition. That’s fighting words to some. Similarly, skepticism not founded on fact is not true skepticism but pseudo skepticism. The atheist and the agnostic reject the possibility of Resurrection, but the Resurrection is, or is not, a fact. The faith that the Resurrection is real is founded on facts as reported in five written accounts and in the sudden transformation of a group of cowering disciples who became inflamed with great courage unto death. And then there is the Shroud of Turin. Is the evidence circumstantial: yes. But other than the unprecedented nature of the event what is the proof that it did not happen. The Universe was created when a incredibly tiny “singularity” blossomed into a tiny bit of matter of incredible, virtually immeasurable heat and began the expansion that we are still experiencing to date. Anybody witness that? Where’s the proof? Does any one have the power to repeat it? Yet most educated humans and scientists now accept it as a fact. I certainly do. The Shroud of Turin is a fact. I believe it’s authenticity has been established as a fact and that authenticity is as the burial cloth of a person whose existence is an historical fact. There are some fundamentalist and even some not so fundamentalist who still protest to faith that is not science and therefore believe on faith. If that comforts you, that’s fine. But the time as come to understand that science and religion are no longer running on parallel courses. The issues science is grappling with including, inter alia, the nature of human conscience are religious issues. A reporter for Rolling Stone who covered the STURP team in Turin in 1978 wrote that apart from proposed carbon dating, there was as much room for doubt as to the authenticity of the Shroud as there was on a “crowded microdot.” And he rejected Christ’s divinity. That was before the STURP team published its results and before the C14 fiasco.

Centuries of progress in medicine would have been short circuited. The image of the Shroud is of a real human body of someone who was tortured, scourged and crucified.

I think we can all agree that Shroud science began with the Pia photographs. That first published scientific study of the Shroud was Paul Vignon’s 1902 book on the Shroud that was translated into English. I think it is fair to say, that it culminated in STURP’s 120 hours of scientific examination of the Shroud in Turin in 1978. The scientific tests used by the Shroud team and by scientists in the aftermath (cf Heller and Adler) were in fact based on the advances of quantum mechanics. For example, that certain aspects of the Shroud are fluorescent when bombarded by certain wave lengths of light that the object being bombarded discharges light of a certain wave length. The image itself is not fluorescent. Heller and Adler used an early microscopic digital image analyzer. It was, if you were read their work, a very exacting process, dependent on the use of tiny portions taken from the Shroud. There work occurred in the US on samples of Shroud fibriles taken during the 120 hours. Today, digital spectral imaging cameras can examine an artifact and if carefully controlled is absolutely non intrusive. A French firm was able to use one in the Louvre and unlock the original appearance of the Mona Lisa. An explanation of how they did it and the results can be found on t their web site: http://www.lumiere technology.com/ Unlike WWII, Scientific study of the Shroud will never end. So maybe it is better to think of STURP as not the end, the beginning of a new era. To look back 36 years at STURP and carp about what they were able to do in it’s remarkable 120 hours is well, as the Brit’s would say “a bit much.” What they accomploshed was ground breaking. It was clearly the beginning not of the end but a new ea which, hopefully will end only when humanity does. And then again, according to science that may be sooner, rather than later. “.","date":"2014-07-31","mins":"7:12 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/31/okay-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-used-the-word-significant/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Okay, maybe I shouldn’t have used the word ‘Significant’"},{"id":"comment-141419","author":"john_klotz","post":"PS, I am in perfect accord with Colin’s basic point: that it’s time for a new “STURP” team study of the Shroud,.","date":"2014-07-31","mins":"7:15 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/07/31/okay-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-used-the-word-significant/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Okay, maybe I shouldn’t have used the word ‘Significant’"},{"id":"comment-33862","author":"john_klotz","post":"When it comes to the Shroud, unlike Russell’s teapot we know it exists and the issue is: What kind of teapot.?

What his meant, I had no idea.” When I read in an article about the taking of the Shroud samples for C 14 testing, that the Turin authority objected to the bright lights because of the potential for damage to the Shroud, the thought occurred to me that a scorch by light may be a solution. Can light scorch? In the Boy Scouts we learned you could start a fire by using a magnifying glass to capture the sun’s rays.

I find Genesis revealing and relevant not as history of creation but as the history of humanities grappling with the mystery of its own existence. Even St. Augustine regarded it as metaphor. As you advance through scripture from Genesis, however, it becomes clear that the metaphorical gets mixed in with actual historical events. Disentangling the metaphor from the actual history becomes a complex process. I think it is quite clear that the authors of the New Testament by and large did not believe they were writing metaphor but compiling history from pre existing traditions or lost original texts. If there is one thing an authentic Shroud does, it is to confirm in great detail, the four Gospel accounts of Christ’s death and point towards his Resurrection. However,we must be careful in our scriptural exegesis to not take wild assumptions and leaps of faith and disguise them as revealed truth. Some fundamentalists do that and the construction of “Jesus took the Shroud with him” is one of those constructs that is actually a theory. Added to the problem are the apocryphal writings that were rejected when the current canon of the New Testament took it present form. One example of biblical exegesis run wild are the recurring apocalyptic prophesies of impending doom. Some Christians at the end of the first millennium were convinced that 1000 AD [CE] would be the year of the Apocalypse. Repeated claims of Apocalypse have been made throughout history since that time. Of course, I must confess that I am now a believer in an approaching Apocalypse but it is based not on Scripture but science.

One of those is the fineness of the detail of the image. Assuming arguendo a block print, or a painting, the image is too fine for any known method of reproduction. Also, there is the blood problem. It did not go negative and is shown in all its red glory, preserved according to Adler by the presence of bilirubin. A quick look at recent studies on the Internet confirm that stress does in fact increase bilirubin. Those studies were of mental stress that was used to excite the production of bilirubin. Can you imagine the stress of torture and crucifixion? As one correspondent to this blog has pointed out its the combination of the blood (image???) and the body image that refute any painting or block printing theory. It isn’t one factor that determines the legitimacy of the image as being created by an as yet unknown process. It’s an accumulation of circumstances. I know some people sneer at circumstantial evidence but ALL evidence concerning the Shroud, including the carbon dating is circumstantial. Among the foremost advocates of using necessity and reliability of circumstantial evidence in studying ancient materials is (gasp) Richard Dawkins.See Dawkins, Richard , Greatest Show on Earth , p. 106. (Kindle Edition) One of the humorous anecdotes in John Hellers’ book on STURP was when he and Addler conducted what Einstein called a “gededenkenexperiment,” – thought experiment – to determine if the Shroud image could be forged.. Their conclusion: it couldn’t be done. See John Heller, Report on the Shroud of Turin, p. 201.

The simplest natural explanation is the one of the one’s proffered by Dave: another cloth on top of the head. But we just don’t know if in fact such a cloth existed and except for the Sudarium which appears authentic and which if properly analyzed by new scientific tests could, or could not be, matched. By that I mean the kind of deep “quantum” analysis that was performed by Heller and Adler on the blood from the Shroud. Matching spectra? But here is something that is beyond theory and into the area of speculation. However when it comes to the process of image formation, everything for now is speculation. The importance of the image is that the image “is”. Is it a part of the great mystery of Christ’s “I am?” We should know better but we tend to still think of the Resurrection in our three dimensional “physical” universe. Many decades ago, before I went to college, I remember seeing at the magazine section of a local drug store, a copy of a magazine that popularized scientific issues a cover proclaiming an explanation of time as the fourth dimension. The cover included an illustration of Salvador Dali’s “Persistence of Memory” famous for its drooping watches. When I looked inside the magazine, the entire article was just a few lines referencing the Dali painting. I was disappointed. A few years later, I was at a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol attending a two week encampment at Samson Air Force Base at Seneca Lake, We slept in barracks and ate the Air Force food. There are two things that I remember vividly. One was a fellow cadet calling out in the middle of the night “You know that stuff they put in the food?” and then answering the question “It doesn’t work..” The other was a fellow cadet, Melvin Weinstein, from Albany NY who had won a Westinghouse prize at some level or other. I asked him about it and he said “I made model tesseracts.” “What was that? I asked. “It’s a four dimension cube,” he replied. “Want to make one? Get some straws.” I did and we did. If you have ever drawn a three dimensional cube on paper which is essential two squares with four corners joined by a slanted lines at the corner, you might be able to visualize what we did. We constructed two three dimensional cubes from straws and then connected the eight corners by straws. I was amazed because it reminded me of a stroboscopic picture I had seen in Life magazine of Ted Williams swing a bat. It was as if the cube was moving through space. The distance traveled being the length of the connecting straws. Time was the fourth dimension, Freidman cautioned me that the model of a four dimension cube we had created was not the most accurate. Actually, the cube moving though time expanded in all directions. The proper representation was one cube inside a larger one, joined at the corners. That would have been tough to do with soda straws. Assume arguendo the reality of the Resurrection. Something happened to Christ’s body that has no precedent. Dame Isabel Pizcek has referred to the Shroud as an “event horizon.” Perhaps she is right and perhaps that explains the image. We would tend to think of the body as moving through the cloth in a singular direction. But if it was moving into another dimension, or existence, it would have been moving from our perspective in all “directions” or no direction at all. I would suggest that these are issues of quantum mechanics. On the other hand, applying Occam’s Razor, the existence of a head band, as proffered by Dave, may be the simplest solution. : ).","date":"2014-01-15","mins":"8:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/01/15/top-of-head-puzzle/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Top of Head Puzzle"},{"id":"comment-6997","author":"john_klotz","post":"Perhaps the something that is missing is the one thing that the so called scientific method refuses to recognize: the Resurrection..","date":"2012-01-15","mins":"8:46 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/15/tough-questions-from-sciencebod/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Tough Questions from Sciencebod"},{"id":"comment-7022","author":"john_klotz","post":"I think it is a truncated scientific process that leaves no room for the inexplicable.

It does so essentially without affecting the Shroud and the results available in a digital format are then available indefinitely. There were similar studies made by STURP. The Quad mosaics were a rough analogy but they did not have the ability to allow specification of materials, only differences in gross composition. A rough analogy would be the ability of the VP 8 analyzer to convert differences of intensity into a tree dimensional representation of the object. The most directly relevant STURP test may have been Heller and Adler using the spectrum of Methemogloben to identify ancient blood. It might also be possible to identify the the presence or absence of Vanillin at various places on the Shroud. Maybe we could do Arizona’s remaining sample and whatever is left of he Gonella hold back. The process would work on large areas or microscopic. It would all be one digital file recording the chemical composition of each point of the globe. We might also be able to back track and create views at various points of its history.

I am beginning to think that the whole issue of a “scorch” is a tempest in a Oxonian tea pot. If the intent is to prove that that the Shroud could have been faked by a “scorch”, so what? Some hypothesize that the image was caused by a burst of energy or light. An Italian scientist claims to have come closer than anyone else through the use of a laser process. Essentially, a light scorch. Let me introduce you to a former neighbor of mine in Riverdale, the late Martin Tytell. Martin was a questioned document examiner and a forensic expert on typewriters. He was retained by the defense team of Alger Hiss to demonstrate that the stolen cables from the State Department that were retyped by his wife on an Woodstock typewriter could have been faked because it was possible to duplicate the attributes of the Underwood. The claim was the FBI framed Hiss by so doing. By God he did it, although it took two years and the Courts appear disinterested in the results of his labor. Because something can be forged, it doesn’t mean that the thing has been forged. In the case of the Shroud, there is yet no evidence of how the Shroud in toto could have been forged. Perhaps Collin Berry should adjust his goals. If his intent is to prove the Shroud is a fake because he can forge a copy, he has failed miserably. IF his intent to to come up with a process explaining how the image was made, he should keep on, keeping on. There are many in the Shroud world who are ready to accept a “natural” explanation of the image. But then we arrive at a question: what is natural? No one as yet come with in a country mile of duplicating the Shroud image by a natural process. We can get copies made to day that imitate he Shroud but they are copies of the Shroud. The creation process of the image remains a mystery. No one has produced an original image from scratch that duplicates the Shroud. I think there is a corollary of sorts to Occam’s Razor. Exceptional events require exceptional explanations. The Shroud image is an exceptional event. All the frustrated labor that has gone into attempts to create an “original” duplicate have been in vain. By original duplicate I mean a double image of the body of a crucified man with his wounds in exquisite detail created with a maximum of 48 hours that is not a copy of the Shroud itself. Hasn’t been done yet. If you have to ask me why 48 hours, the answer is simple. The forensic pathologists who have reviewed in detail the Shroud have concluded that it shows evidence of rigor mortis and no evidence of putrefaction. Rigor mortis freezes the muscles soon after death but releases normally in 48 hours. Similarly, putrefaction begins to exude all kinds of nasty stuff after 48 hours. Strange coincidence: all four Gospels have Mary Magdalene discovering the empty tomb on Sunday morning at day break – roughly 6:00 AM, approximately 39 hours after Christ expired on the cross. I believe that mystery of the image will be finally be resolved, if ever, by reference to a process on the quantum level – the laser, for example, being essential a quantum mechanical application. Is that way out? How about this quotation from a well known, screwball publication (now known as Bloomberg Business Week.) “Developing quantum theory was ‘the crowning intellectual achievement of the last century,’ says California Institute of Technology physicist John Preskill. It’s the underlying principle for many of today’s devices, from lasers to magnetic resonance imaging machines. And these may prove to be just the low hanging fruit. Many scientists foresee revolutionary technologies based on the truly strange properties of the quantum world.” Business Week, March 15, 2004 Cited in: Rosenblum, Bruce; Kutter, Fred (2011 07 01).

I discuss Heller and Adler in Chapter 9 of my book, The Coming of the Quantum Christ. The device they used was a microspectrophotometer. (MSP). The MSP produced a digital read out of the spectrum of the object. MDI records the spectrum data in a permanent digital file which is then available for detailed examination. All of the spectra including the invisible ones (infrared and ultra violet) are recorded. In essence, MDI combines the Quad Mosaic information with the spectrum information. The actually photographs until processed are black and white similarly to the Quad Mosaic process. There is an excellent presentation of this information on the Lumiere Technology web site which analyzed both the Mona Lisa and La Bella Principessa. See http://www.lumiere technology.com/discoveries.html. I include a discussion of Lumiere’s work in Chapter 14 of my book which deals with the Shroud’s provenance. The drum I am beating right now is for the use of MDI to analyze the Shroud. (Chapter 18 of my book, its conclusion).It is generally non destructive. However, the light used to illuminate the work has to be filtered to prevent light pollution. While the microspectrophotometer may appear “primitive” today, Heller and Adler were able to identify the spectrum of methemoglobin on samples obtained from the Shroud and that meant it was real, very ancient, degraded hemoglobin. But actually this is something we agree on: The utility of employing MDI to analyze the Shroud. The result might be several terabytes or so of data well with the capability of even desktops now. The programs that analyze the data are sophisticated but available. Moreover, an MDI data base of the Shroud would allow for research and examination world wide without interference. Also, the database would allow peer review and criticism of the results of any analysis – unlike the basic carbon lab data which the labs have refused to release.

I haven’t a clue as to what the law maybe in other countries.

This is an amazing post in that it deals quite substantially, and scientifically, with the issue at hand. One of the problems I see is that we have too many “experts” in one field spouting off in areas in which they are not expert. Charles Freeman is an art historian. That does not make him an expert on physics. His “learned” opinions on things such as negativity are simply not in his area of expertise. His opinions are really speculations. Now a word for the hated class of humanity – lawyers, especially litigators. Evaluating expert testimony is a part of what we do on a regular basis. I have one case where representing a plaintiff, I recently used an expert accountant to assess a damage issue. Whether that expert was appropriate is now an issue on appeal by the losing (so far) side. I once remarked that an expert is someone with a point of view and a library card. My son Michael corrected me: “an expert is someone with a point of view, a library card and a check.” In writing my manuscript, I had the advice of a Ph D in physics who advised me on the image issues. He was adamant about one thing: the image is not a holograph because it lacks a “phase” component. He also understood what Jackson and Pete Schumacher have written: the VP 8 creates a brightness map. (Actually, my adviser preferred a “darkness” map which is the other side of the same coin. His tongue may have been slightly in cheek.) Point is, that when dealing with the image, reference must be made to physics, not the speculations of an art historian publishing in a history journal, peer reviewed, I expect by other historians, if at all. One more point, although I have occasionally twitted Colin (really without malice, it’s a Yankee thing I guess) his latest contributions have been remarkable and productive although we differ on the ultimate issue.

I quote Elaine Pagels from her landmark work The Gnostic Gospels: “In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition.

Throughout history, things which were once considered spiritual have devolved to scientific explanation. Scientific studies have shown “paranormal” or PSI phenomena are real. But, orthodox scientist reject them out of hand because they can’t square such results with there bias against religion. They are “pseudo skeptics.” The takeaway from Penrose is that consciousness is a quantum activity. We shall see where that leads. Consciousness is a key actor in quantum theory. The reason why I closed my blog with John1:1 is quite simple. The “Word” is the primordial consciousness. Thus I would paraphrase it: “In the beginning was the consciousness and consciousness was with God and the consciousness was God.” Darwin was reviled as an enemy of religion. It took Teilhard to harmonize evolution and religion and place them in a divine context. I do not believe in the intelligent design description of evolution. But I do believe that evolution has a direction – consciousness evolving from the alpha to the omega. The best is yet to be. As far as theologians, a quite many of them skip around the physical reality of the Shroud. John Meier in Volume One of a Marginal Jew bemoans the fact that Christ left no artifacts. Really? Sooner or later, the theologians are going to deal withe Shroud and the Quantum Mechanics of existence. I am with Teilhard: neither science nor religion can ignore the other and it is at the quanta the demarcation line vanishes. As far as what the quantum reality of consciousness is, Mitchell describes it as a quantum hologram.

I agree that you can define God out of existence by defining him too broadly. I think the dividing line is “self” consciousness. Teilhard defined the breaking point for humanity from the rest of creation was when the human species attained the power of reflection – self awareness. (As I am sure you are aware – no pun intended). I have said that science can be staring God in the face and never see him. Certainly there is a movement in Christian theology that I believe tends to define Christ out of existence. The Shroud is what brings Him back. Are you familiar with the concept of Boltzmann brains: self conscious entities that pop in and out of existence due to quantum fluctuations? They were theorized by a mathematician physicist at the dawn of the twentieth century. It’s the self conscious part that puzzles me. To define what an atheist is, we have to define what God is. I will make a confession, I do not believe in the Garden of Eden and that God walked and talked with our first parents, nor do I believe in Adam and Eve at all. Neither do I believe that God ordered Joshua to massacre the women and children of Jericho. Does that make me an atheist? It certainly would to some fundamentalists. I have corresponded with a professor at Howard who as written on “original” sin being “original selfishness”, one of the driving forces of evolution. He is not an atheist. Throughout history what once thought to be a divine mysteries have been explained by science and yet mystery remains. I believe that the quantum enigma(s) we encounter are in fact the fingerprints of the creator, who some, including me, define as the primordial consciousness. I also believe that when in comes to self conscious entities, entanglement is love, both literally and figuratively. One summer at a Civil Air Patrol Cadet encampment I meant an aspiring physicist from Albany named, as I recall, Friedman ( his first name may have been Milton, I wouldn’t swear on it). He had won a high school science award building tesseracts – three dimensional representations of four dimensional objects. He decided to build one with me out of soda straws. When we were finished what we had was two cubes connected together at all points by straws at a 45 degree angle. The unmistakable impression was of a cube moving through space. I was instantly reminded of a time lapse photograph of Ted Williams swinging a baseball bat. My god, I thought: Time is the fourth dimension. This was many decades after Einstein, of course, and a few years after I had first read of the concept. I still have a difficult time understanding what I perceive as the passage of time to be what Einstein explained, but the tesseract “speaks” for itself. As to human consciousness, the key is to be sure we are talking about self consciousness. All animate objects including plants have a consciousness, however primitive. The great mystery of human existence is self consciousness – Teilhard’s power of reflection. That the brain is a quantum computer (whatever that is) is a start to greater understanding. I think reading “word” in St. John for self conscious entity is an acceptable metaphor for the God who caused the creation Universe. As far as Teilhard being a pantheist, what does that make one the admirers of his visions, Pope Benedict?.","date":"2012-08-23","mins":"8:43 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/08/22/can-our-consciousness-operate-independent-of-time-and-space/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Can our consciousness operate independent of time and space?"},{"id":"comment-50407","author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles, I don’t mean to be modest, but satisfying me will not be the top item on anybody’s agenda.

No matter how de Charny got it, it was on one level stolen property at some point. I believe I saw at one point but failed to note it, that Clement carefully cadged his approval of he Shroud so as not to approve of authenticty claims because the Church was still seeking reunion with Orthodox and a claim that it was an authentic artifact of Christ would engender Orthodox demands for its return. (Which would have by the way made in vulnerable to the Islamists armies who were on the move.) Do you have any thoughts on that. I have a riff on Dawkins in my first chapter because he has a dim view of eye witness testimony and actually prefers solid circumstantial evidence. That’s because in archaeology anthropology there are no eye witnesses. Bias is usually a slur. However, I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag, but it is my opinion that the weight of the circumstantial evidence is authenticity. Can’t defend that in a few hurried, and often typo filled, comments on a blog. But I do not believe that the inability to draw a conclusion from evidence already offered is a disqualification if the mind is open. By the way, by reason of the personal experiences of someone very close to me, I have observed the National Institute of Health (NIH) for two decades. There is fierce competition for grants. Is there fraud by some, you betcha. (Palinease for “You bet there is”) Fraud is NOT endemic. Pride is. The NIH has funded programs of ultimate value far beyond its budget. Overall the NIH is grant program a most valuable and necessary component of US science and one of the bedrock for the US’s scientific and economic progress. You double betcha. Let me say this once in sum. The carbon labs waged a determined effort to keep STURP out of the carbon dating process and to stop any further scientific tests if the carbon date was not within range of 30 CE. STURP had one function in the tests: to select the best sites for taking samples. Because STURP was excluded from the process, the worst possible site was chosen. Surely you must realize that for carbon dating the sample must be typical of the entire object. It wasn’t. But those chapters are already written and I have to move on and not debate it further. My work will speak for itself (if anybody gets to read it). Frankly, I am impressed by the support I’ve gotten. I even have permission from Elaine Pagels author of the Gnostic Gospels to use a long quote from her book (God bless the Internet). I’ll use it now since it is not original with me: It’s from Chapter Two, working title: The Story as Told.” “Then she puts martyrdom in the context of Christ’s passion in words that echo Pasternak: ‘In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.'” Finally, show a little respect for those whose opinions differ from you.

I get up to try a warm cup of milk, then compulsively check my E Mail, see Dan has posted from my blog and then I am not entirely gratified to discover that in the time it took for the milk to warm the skeptical critics are at it. As we used so in my adolescence: I wonder who put sand in their Vaseline. By the way, I left out one person who apparently desired the Shroud and searched for it: Adolf Hitler. It was hidden in a monastery under the altar and when the Nazi’s came to monastery to search they found the monks praying around the altar and did not disturb them. They left emptied handed perhaps feeling it was a wild goose chase. I am sorry Charles and Colin, but the Shroud is too important for the Church to surrender it to secular authorities. When it comes to my starting “a stamp on any moves towards retesting campaign” that is precisely what I am not doing. What I am doing is trying to show a path towards testing. However, it has to be non intrusive. You may balk at examining the reason STURP succeeded and look at the naked power play of the carbon labs that destroyed STURP participation as a model, but that is not going to be an appropriate model: Fool me once etc. When it comes to corruption, the corruption of science represented by the carbon testing was gigantic fiasco. By the way, it was not Thomas de Wesselow who first called it that but at 4:441 EST, I am not going to check for the original use of the fiasco label. Secular science flunked the carbon dating. In fact, it’s a template for how it can’t be done. When I publish my manuscript if I ever get it finished you will see why I can write that. Luigi Gonella every body’s fall guy for what went wrong, has stated that the labs blackmailed the Vatican by threatening a campaign saying the Vatican was protecting the Shroud form science.

These cotton fibres were held in place with a crust of terpene. At the conference Robert described to me how the laboratory spent a considerable time examining the crust to determine the presence of terpene.

He is coming back. If I may change metaphors in mid stream, the Shroud is Christ’s magic carpet which he is riding back into our consciousness. I can envision a magic carpet more readily than a bike as shroud. It’s carpet magically woven by science. I said “coming back.” Now I personally don’t recommend rushing down to to Jones Beach or any other handy open space to await the Rapture. Allegories and metaphors are representations of the truth and not always intrinsically true in themselves. That’s why among fundamentalists there are “pre millenialists” and “post millenialists.” But the decades of scientific study of the Shroud are beginning to register. He is returning to or consciousness in ways previously unimagined. Perhaps prophesied? In Heller’s book, he wrote that after he came into possession of a fiber, he wanted to examine it as closely as possible for blood so he put on his white lab coat and went to his lab where the best equipment was. How about this from Revelations: “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” Revelations 7:14 Are scientists in their white lab coats bringing Christ to us? On the other hand there is Joe Nickell, a man with no scientific credentials per se seeking to debunk the Shroud who loves to pose in a “white lab coat.” “Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” Matthew 7:15 20 Can a lab coat also be “sheep’s clothing.

The one thing de Wesselow did do is demonstrate the absurdity of the medieval claims from an art historian’s point of view.

I was never very taken with suggestions about divine providence. I was brought up to believe the “lord helps those who helps themselves.” I have also felt, however, that a conversion of science and the Shroud which began at the turn of the last century might indicate that something was at work that might be more than coincidence and that, perhaps, the Shroud has been waiting for science to release its revelation about the reality of Christ. But what strikes me now, is that the Pia’s historical photo shoot came at the same time that the science of quantum mechanics was taking form and that the Newtonian, determinsitic universe was beginning to collapse. Something really important is brewing. We may be privileged to participate in it. But the yada yada yada of the doubters who do not have a scientific leg to stand on any more may be just a distraction. We may have important work to do..","date":"2012-04-15","mins":"7:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/15/francis-turretin-had-long-hair/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Francis Turretin had long hair"},{"id":"comment-73527","author":"john_klotz","post":"I can’t believe that more people access Oxford than this blog.

And imaging a scenario that might have happened ignores the evidence of what did happen. Against hard facts, even circumstantial facts, speculation falls unless supported by hard, not imagined facts (and then it wouldn’t be speculation). One of the things Heller and Adler did is conduct a gedanken (thought) experiment trying to image how the Shroud could have been faked. These very brilliant and accomplished men, one of whom was Jewish couldn’t find any reasonable scenario that could account for the hard facts that are demonstrated by the Shroud. Why do so many people search frantically for explanations which are fanciful and without any historical precedent? Is the the fact of Christ’s crucifixion so frightening that you must flee from its truth? That is really a shame, you are missing something that really gives flavor and meaning to life – of everyone.

Every day we make decisions after weighing the available facts. But almost always we have doubts. Fear the person who has no doubt. Think George Armstrong Custer. If we only acted in the absence of doubt, we would probably seldom act at all. Even Mother Theresa, who devoted her life to caring for the most desperate of the residents of the Calcutta slums, confessed to moments of black doubt. “Unfortunately, one of the hallmarks of the current era are people who profess freedom from doubt under circumstances where doubt would seem to be a reasonable proposition. For example, newly militant atheists are crusading against any form of religion and express no doubt about the absence of any God of any kind. They claim to arrive at their conclusions by the dispassionate application of the scientific method. Foremost among the militant atheists is Oxford Don Richard Dawkins whose literary rant against religion, The God Delusion, has sold more than two million copies since it was published in 2005. The cover jacket for Delusion, modestly describes Dawkins has “the world’s most prominent atheist” (the “atheist pope” so to speak), “Opposed to the atheistic militants are, among others, young earth fundamentalists be they Christian, Islamic or Jewish. To those fundamentalists, despite all the scientific evidence to the contrary, the world is a scant 6,000 years old and man walked with dinosaurs. Indeed, to some, the Grand Canyon is but an artifact of Noah’s flood. They are but cat’s paw for the atheistic militants who delight in demonstrating their absurdities. Nonetheless, the most potent weapon of the militant atheists, aside from acerbic wit, is their scientific credentials.” Again, if you want to correspond try klotzlaw@gmail.com.","date":"2013-11-27","mins":"10:41 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"id":"comment-52941","author":"john_klotz","post":"Hugh, You have four accounts of the body being laid in the tomb and that it was missing within three days.

St Paul, I believe, stated that if Christ did not rise from the dead than our faith is in vain. I am not a Greek scholar and I do not know what the Greek word was, but I had to look up vain when I started to write that sentence because I suddenly realized I didn’t remember which way to spell vain. There is of course vein and vane all quite proper words in their own right. But having checked to be sure I spelled it correctly, I was interested in the the definitions of vain I found. 1. Having or showing an excessively high opinion of one’s appearance, abilities, or worth. “their flattery made him vain” synonyms:conceited, narcissistic, self loving, in love with oneself, self admiring, self regarding, self obsessed, egocentric, egotistic, egotistical; More antonyms:modest 2. Producing no result; useless. “a vain attempt to tidy up the room” synonyms:futile, useless, pointless, to no purpose, hopeless, in vain; I don’t know if you took time to read it, but I was particularly struck by Kim Dreisbach’s valedictory read in Perugia posthumously: “The Ecumenical Implications of he Shroud of Turin” see https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/dreisbach4.pdf The reason I was so touched by it is that in sum he stated what has become my conclusion: the Shroud of Turin is a Revelation for our time brought to us by science. To me as a fan of Teilhard de Chardin, that’s huge. That’s epochal. When I started my project and was examining closely the pictures of the Shroud for the first time and reading Barbet and Bucklin, among others, I had what some call a “Shroud Moment.” For the first time in the seven decades my life, I sensed on a personal level what he must have suffered. It’s not that I was in pain, it’s that the reality of that suffering finally sunk in. Christian theology has had trouble grappling with some simple facts of history. There was no garden of Eden and no original sin has we now understand it. My favorite definition of original sin is that it is the innate selfishness of all life that was the driving force of evolution. Scripture tells the story of humanity striving to overcome that selfishness. The antithesis of selfishness is love. I believe hat the death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ teaches us that love, in the end, conquers. As Saint Paul wrote: there exist these three Faith, Hope and Love. The greatest of these is Love for in eternity Faith and Hope will pass away while Love shall endure forever. It has been more than a hundred years since Secondo Pia first discovered the meaning and vitality of the image of the Shroud. No one has explained the process of how that image was created. Many have tried. What Colin Berry and the WAG that Dan posted demonstrate is that it is a childish exercise. To paraphrase St. Paul: it’s time to put the childish things aside. Ecce Homo! You may think am avoiding your arguments but I rely on the arguments of scientists like Heller, Adler and the others of the STURP team. These were people of scientific accomplishment before they went to Turin. I’ll take their word. Have you ever examined an actual fiber of he Shroud or do you rely on interpreting pictures taken by others? Do you consider yourself a superior scientist to Ray Rogers?.","date":"2013-11-26","mins":"9:47 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"id":"comment-52922","author":"john_klotz","post":"At the risk of sounding like someone with faith, which a “true” scientist wouldn’t have, I believe that at the end of the day, the simplest explanation for the image of the Shroud is a process connected to the Resurrection. I also believe that someday “science” will recognize that fact. I think that much of the confusion about the distortions of the image arises from the fact hat the body was not flat at the instant when the image was formed. Forensic pathologists such as Bucklin and Zugibe have found that the body was in a state of rigor mortis. In Chapter 14 of Zugibe’s book “The Crucifixion of Christ: A Forensic Inquiry” he spends a lot of ink discussing “rigor mortis” which he found in the exemplified by the man in the shroud. Between Bucklin and Zugibe there are some disagreement about how crucifixion cause death s but the fact that rigor mortis was present is not in dispute. Zugibe points out that it was necessary for Joseph of Arimithea and whoever else helped him in entombing Christ to “break the rigor mortis” because since the man in the shroud was a crucifixion victim his arms would have stiffened at the moment of death in an extended position. That also meant as frequently pictured that his knees were bent and his head and neck when he was laid flat slightly elevated. Because of that measurement of his actually height has must be adjusted. Now whatever the precise image creation process, it reflects the body still in a position of rigor mortis and that means by the Gospel accounts before 3:00 PM on the Sunday following the crucifixion. All four Gospel accounts describe Mary Magdalene discovering the body missing at daybreak on that Sunday. The rigor mortis is one fact established by science that supports a “theory” of Resurrection and adds weight to the conclusion that the Shroud is not a forgery. It’s just one fact but that fact of rigor mortis is a relevant one. It is interesting but maybe not terribly relevant that the digital pictures I take are sometimes distorted. For example, a picture of my dog Bogart (a/k/a “Bogie”) that I once published on my blog shows his head abnormally large in comparison to his body when he was in a sitting position. Also my wife last night was conversing with her niece in Chicago on Skype using her I Phone. The appearance of her niece’s face close up was also distorted. Her nose for example appeared much larger vis a vis her face. The very distortions that some see in the shroud man are not the result of an “incompetent” artist but likely caused by the time of the image creation when the man in the shroud was in a state of rigor mortis. Now maybe someone can dispute rigor mortis. Okay, go ahead but only forensic pathologists may apply..","date":"2013-11-27","mins":"8:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/26/imagine/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Imagine"},{"id":"comment-52925","author":"john_klotz","post":"Some people find he debates on this blog a waste of time.

However, I have never regarded the historical provenance (since its creation circa 30 CE) to be an issue. To me providence is the interesting aspect of the Shroud. The issue is authenticity and we may never know a complete provenance of the Shroud from time it disappeared from the tomb until it was displayed in Lirey circa 1350 CE and I am really not sure that matters. Martin Kemp is a colleague of yours (I mean a fellow art historian) who made a quite a splash with is involvement authenticating a drawing of a young woman as an original da Vinci. A few years earlier, Christies had evaluated at $20,000 and sold it on consignment. A couple of years later, a new owner showed it to a visitor. He had it stashed in a drawer and the visitor told him that it looked like a da Vinci. Enter Martin Kemp of Oxford, a da Vinci specialist. The known provenance of La Principessa was only from the late nineteenth century at best. He made an exacting scientific examination and determined after that examination that it was a genuine da Vinci and its worth ballooned to over $100,000,000, .let me spell it out: one hundred million dollars. Kemp became the center of a heated debate. His finding was disputed (if not ridiculed) by other experts. He continued his attempts to determine its earlier provenance. He was successful. In Poland he found a folio that celebrated the wedding of a Italian noble’s illegitimate daughter. The noble was a da Vinci patron. She was, as I recall only thirteen and died from complications of pregnancy a few months after her wedding. The folio was bound on the left side. There were holes on the left side of the La Principessa that matched the binding of the folio. It was impossible to determine when La Principessa was removed from the folio, but it was. We (and Kemp) do not know the name of the thief and in what era he operated. However, the discovery of the folio was definitive as to provenance. Not the gaps in possession and provenance that span centuries. Note the deciding factor as holes that matched the binding. Note the acceptance of the La Principessa and the astronomical jump in its evaluation. As far as the Shroud is concerned, Kemp recently wrote a book on icons: From Christ to Coke. He identified the image of Christ as the greatest of historical icons. Alas, he indicated at one point in his book that he was more or less an agnostic. (He kind of let that slip.) It’s my interpretation of what he wrote. He dismisses the Shroud as early Renaissance from the north of Italy or France. He apparently did this a merely a visual observation of photographs of the Shroud. He certainly did not conduct the actual painstaking examination that he did with La Principessa. Seriously, if here is one thing the STURP examinations demonstrated: it was not a painting. I am not ready to write iy today but this episode will be recited in my manuscript. Here’s the important fact. Based on his evaluation, the value of La Principessa was increased by a factor of 10,000 X. And there are still huge gaps in his provenance and there is no chain of title complete from da Vinci’ patron to modern times. Indeed, the determining fact were binding holes in the side of the drawing. Matching holes – there is something about that. Can you think of an analogy? I can, guess what? {I am writing this on the fly. I would really appreciate your prospective on this, or if I misstated anything – in your opinion.

Your opinions and expertise are valuable. I commend all those who are dedicated to tracking the complete provenance from Tomb to Turin. If it is ever unraveled I am sure that it will be a fascinating story full of interesting characters, some saints, some not so saintly. Recently in my draft which is now up to date and has only the ramification chapters to go, I referred to the resignation of Benedict and the fact that his greatest gift to the Church may have been establishing a precedent for elderly popes to resign rather than clinging to their office even though severely incapacitated. (The idea of the being Benedict’s greatest gift is not original with me but I can’t put a finger on where I read it right now.) Here’s what I have written: “Benedict had been a confident of his predecessor and was at his side throughout his decline. In 2013, Benedict was a year older than John Paul was at the time of his death. There is no reason not to take Benedict’s stated reason at face value and in his resignation he established a precedent for other popes in declining years. The precedent he set may very well be his greatest contribution to the Church. He certainly fared better than the last previous pope to truly voluntarily resign: Pope Celestine XII in 1294. He wished to return to his pre papacy life as a hermit. Alas, Celestine was arrested by his successor and died a papal prisoner” The irony is that after I wrote that and put Chapter 13 to bed, I discovered on a lamp table a book about Celestine. I asked my wife about it. It turns out she had purchased it at Barnes and Noble but hadn’t gotten into it yet: Coincidence, providence, provenance????

She, as I recall was a Hindu. I don’t know of any man other than not a devout Catholic but a blinkered one who will tell a doctor, go ahead let my wife die under those circumstances. I believe it was a Arizona Archbishop who disciplined a nun who was a hospital administrator when she agreed with a medical teams decision to perform an abortion that saved the mother’s life. She should have followed Catholic doctrine and let the mother die. Finally in Brazil, a doctor and a nine year old girl who had been raped by her step father and was carrying twins were excommunicated on Vatican orders for performing an abortion when to carry the child would have resulted in the girl’s death because her body was not developed enough to complete the pregnancy.

For example, I believe I posted a bit on Father Rinaldi including a link to a Sign Magazine article that he wrote in 1934 when still a seminarian in Italy. That article was the beginning of the serious Shroud study in the US for it attracted the attention of many thousands of Catholics including Father Wuenschel who went on to found the Holy Shroud Guild. Fr. Rinaldi who immigrated to he US became, along with Fr. Otterbein, a star in the Shroud world. Rinaldi was probably the single most important person 44 years later in STURP being formed and in gaining access to the Shroud (I don’t mean to gainsay the contributions and organizational talents of Dr. Robert Jackson in writing that). When my book is complete, you will be able to read about it. That chapter is already drafted and has received favorable reviews from those I shared it with privately and who commented. It’s not for publication yet. My digging Rinaldi’s article out of an archive in Pennsylvania got some attention from some very interesting quarters including one across the Pond in GB. I really don’t want to be so defensive about this but I do resent the “loony” part. Has someone profiled me and figured out how to get under my skin? Not that I am paranoid or anything. The working title of my manuscripts is: “The Coming of the Quantum Christ: The Shroud of Turin and the Future of Science and Humanity.” I owe a portion of that title to Dame Isabel Pizek who once said: “The future of science is the Shroud of Turin.” The reason she could say that is ultimately I think she believes as I do, that the issue of the Shroud image will be resolved at the level of quantum mechanics. Now if you want loony, try quantum mechanics. Richard Dawkins, the atheist pope (my description cc) is quoted in the introduction to my manuscript drafted a year ago: “Perhaps there are some genuinely profound and meaningful questions that are forever beyond the reach of science. Maybe quantum theory is already knocking on the door of the unfathomable. But if science cannot answer some ultimate question, what makes anybody think that religion can?” Now that’s loony, or is it?.","date":"2013-01-12","mins":"8:58 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/01/11/living-free-the-thomas-aquinas-and-pierre-teilhard-de-chardin-part/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Living Free: The Thomas Aquinas and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Part"},{"id":"comment-21935","author":"john_klotz","post":"Gabriel, That is a direct quote from Isabel Pizek. She may have been quoting a European physicist when she said it. I don’t know what your position is on the Shroud or the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The are some who take the attitude I guess of the old song: “How do I know, the Bible tells me so.” Biblical interpretation (exegesis) is not easy and to read the Bible as something dictated by God with human authors playing stenographers doesn’t do justice to the Bible, the putative stenographers or, for that matter, God. If the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus Christ, and I believe it is, then the simplest solution to the mystery of its image is the Resurrection. At that point it becomes the most important object on the face of the Earth. I believe that ultimately it will be science that will unlock the mystery of the image and I believe it will be unlocked at the quantum level of existence. (The late Ray Rogers has already been there in one sense, a tiny fingerprint of the quantum is in his calculations.) The quantum, IMVHO is the interface between the primordial consciousness (God) from which our existence sprung at the Big Bang and that existence. The Shroud is a link between science and God. Revealing that primordial existence will be a scientific accomplishment beyond measure. It’s the future of science and religion, the synthesis of which was predicted by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

How many does that represent compared to the number of abortions. The whole point is contraception and health services. Is it not a fact that the number far exceeds the number of pregnant women who receive abortions.? I am not a proponent of abortion as birth control or being used as an excuse to ignore reasonable precautions. Every abortion is a failure. Sometimes the reasons for the abortion arise from natural circumstances beyond the control of the woman, her doctor, her husband or companion. The cases I cited: two in which the Catholic Church penalized individuals who acceded to an abortion where the life of the mother was in stake and one in Ireland where Catholic doctors enforced anti abortion laws and the mother died – as the doctors knew she would. Since you seem conversant with the figures, how many women received health related services from PP WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. That would certainly include health screenings and contraception. I believe the number would be far, far in excess of those who were pregnant. And if PP were a single minded abortion organization, how did those who were pregnant escape its clutches with their pregnancy intact? Could be that PP helped the women carry to term? Do you know? Your statement indicates that many women received pre natal care. Where those women go if PP were defunded? By the way, do you believe contraception other than the rhythm method is immoral? Do you believe all the women who sought contraception aid from PP were immoral? Do you believe that all the women who received cancer screenings and or health assistance were immoral? Do you believe that a doctor who refuses to perform an abortion knowing that the woman would die acted morally? Do you believe that your morality should be enforced on women and doctors by the criminal code? Are you married Andy? Do you have a wife? Have you ever comforted a wife through a difficult pregnancy? Have you ever told a wife, you are going to have to die because of my/our religious beliefs? Since you seek to enforce your religious beliefs through the civil and criminal law on others, these are relevant questions. I see that in response to the furor over the female ordination controversy a single male who was a member of Opus Dei who had taken a vow of celibacy. Don’t you find that a little weird? I do. If a single male can handle celibacy, his place would probably be with the celibate clergy – either brother or priest. By the way, I have never advised a woman to have an abortion. And my advice has been asked. The circumstances are private. I expect that a large number of individuals who accept the authenticity of the Shroud or at least find it reasonable are “Right to Life” adherents who oppose abortions under all circumstances. That is their choice.

As far as Charles F’s comment, I would say these pictures as well as the issue of the Shroud in general demands a multi disciplinary approach. For example the highest resolution of these photos appears to 64 X in item 5 2. Brown went to more than 3000x for his Scanning Electronic Microscope photographs. While each discipline as some thing to add, each is in its own way is incomplete. We are literally like the blind man and the elephant. Or to turn to another cliche, we have to see the forest that is composed of the trees. The fact is that STURP was multi disciplinary. For example when Machthild Flury Lemberg says there cotton throughout the Shroud was she talking about transients isolated fibers like some of fibers we see in these 32 X or 64 X photos, Or is he talking about something she observed at 3000x with a SEM? Did she use a pocket magnifier? Was the power as high as 32 X? I have my doubts she used 64 X or even 32 X. (OMG, am I a skeptic?)

There were no evidence of pigments in the image itself. Was the “artist” left or right handed? A good art critic or historian can tell. If I ever get my current chapter finished, I will dissect one of the most famous ones as a part of the next and demonstrate how his casual opinion of the Shroud was at odds with his own professional discipline. Trust me on that. “Oh that mine enemy has written a book.” (Not de Wesselow) If I can find his address I will give him a chance to rebut. You will contribute nothing by raising a dead issue. I think an art historian might have something to say about the artistic conventions he might see in the image but the reason for those conventions was the copying of the Shroud itself. If you can show a convention that predates 300 CE or so that contains elements of the Shroud image that might be a start of an interesting conversation but insisting on it being a painting without a shred of evidence other than Mc Crone’s claims which varied by the month then you as big a fool as he was.

The politicians in this country who support the Church’s positions on contraception and abortion are are usually the ones most at war with the poor. There are some exceptions. Bob Casey, for example, who are not. But practically speaking, in this diverse nation, the consensus seems very strong with the social liberals. I think the first real test will be the nuns.

Unlike seismic analysis based upon literal interpretations of the New Testament without taking into account the differing paths of the Gospels to the New Testament, the Shroud is an existing physical fact that teaches about the Crucifixion and, ultimately, the Resurrection. I rejoice in the diversity. The Shroud, here and now existent, unites us. Teilhard predicted a merger of science and religion and that is now at the Shroud. That’s why I regard it as a new Revelation (some have called it a Fifth Gospel). To me the enduring command of Christ as recorded in the Gospels is to love one another. Whatever the origins of Christianity, there was a new hymn we sang in the heady post Vatican II days: You’ll know we are Christians by Our Love. Unfortunately we no longer sing it. It’s our challenge to act it.

Essentially, he stripped down the protocols and thus unwittingly sabotaged the scientific authority of the carbon dating. With all due respect that statement that the adopted protocols were the represented the best science available is simply wrong. Protocols recommended in a conference at Trondheim Norway as well as a conference held in Turin in 1987 all called for sampling of different areas to prevent anomalous results. The three carbon labs tested from samples drawn from the same limited area of the Shroud which was in fact anomalous. The exclusion of STURP from the selection process ultimately doomed the carbon dating to failure. STURP data and detailed examination of the entire Shroud clearly indicated that the sample area was anomalous.

It was the recent You Tube video posted here which explained why such an extraordinary amount was necessary: it was the practice to disinfect or protect the walls with a mixture of such. That work, and the complete preparing of the body, could not be completed before sundown on Friday, the beginning of the Sabbath, because of the lateness in the afternoon of Christ’s death and the fact the body hung on the cross for sometime after his death. The women led by Mary Magdalene were returning at daybreak Sunday to help complete the anointing. Mary looking into the tomb ran and reported to the Apostles; “They have taken his body and we do not where it is. Peter and John (or whoever the disciple Jesus loved was) ran to the tomb and discovered the body was missing and “body bag” was still there. Now Colin adopts and explains the use of the Shroud as body bag (citing Wilson). Maybe at some point, Colin will finally throw in the towel and admit the POSSIBILTY of the Shroud’s authenticity.

Christ hung on the cross after he died long enough for rigor mortis to have set in. There is evidence of dislocation in the shoulders that is consistent with the rigor mortis having been broken. I think Dave B is wrong on this point. I can not envision Christ in a state of rigor mortis being taken down and carried to the tomb arms out stretched rigid from rigor mortis. I can envision after being taken down from the cross, his arms being forced into a position where they were not a hindrance, The breaking was not of bones but of ligaments and muscle in the shoulder, Whether the Shroud was intended for temporary use or not it functioned as a body bag. The truth is that for whatever reason before the preparations of the body could be completed, the Shroud and the body parted company because at daybreak Sunday, the Shroud was found in the tomb but the body wasn’t there.

Is it a snake, a tree, or a wall? My approach, which may seem limited, is to concentrate on two appetites of the Shroud: the body image and the blood. To paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, everything else is commentary. There seems to be a repetitive error that OK addresses: when criticizing the proportions of the Shroud image as being distorted or apart from presumed norm they elide a fundamental aspect of the image. Using a film analogy, the film was not flat and the image was projected askew. Can any one imagine taking a picture with film that is not flat but rumpled and curled? I think OK demonstrated that there had to be distortion. I once posted a picture of my dog, Bogart AKA Bogie taken digitally. There was an immense distortion with his head appearing larger than his body. That doesn’t prove anything except that if the image was created on the Shroud by whatever process and the Shroud was not perfectly taut or the image created at an angle then the image would be distorted. Any photographic expert care to argue with that? Second, a painted copy by an artist is a painted copy by an artist. What one may ask: what was he copying? It appears reasonable that copies of copies of an original object would degrade from the reality of the object. Even photographs when copied degrade with anomalies. That’s one reason why the arguments about what the Shroud shows degrade with the generation of the copy. In the end we are left with an existing physical object in Turin Italy that is traceable to circa 1350. The art historians among us continue to ignore a scientific fact that is actually proven beyond “reasonable doubt.” The Shroud image is not painting. They also ignore another scientific fact: the blood on the Shroud is ancient blood. The D’Arcis memorandum is a hoax and there is evidence that it was elaborated on by Chevalier and Thurston. Thurston adopted Chevalier’s arguments so he is not intellectually culpable. So these are facts about the Shroud that I submit have been proven: the Shroud is not a painting and the blood is real. A final note: one of the egregious errors is the manner in which Shroud skeptics label any scientist whose work they disagree with as a person blinded by religious belief. Alan Adler, who did his work after 1978, was Jewish so was Barrie Schwortz and other members of the Shroud team who were in Turin. According to Schwortz, before the 120 hours of Turin examination in 1978, most of the participants were skeptics of authenticity and expected to find that the image was painted and they could go home. They were surprised. It’s been 36 years, many have passed away. Most that still survive have yet to go home..","date":"2014-12-04","mins":"8:16 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-174632","author":"john_klotz","post":"PHPL: I don’t know if you would thumbs up the following but that’s OK (no pun intended).

The evidence I find decisive is the representation of of burn holes as black rings. Others find other similarities. The Shroud, alone, in contrast to the copies of the Shroud, has actual burn holes with charred edges in the “knights move” configuration. Many of the later copies of the Shroud represent them but they are not actual burn holes but paintings (or drawings) of the burn holes – sometimes as red circles. See the Lier Shroud. That the monk who drew the Pray Codex had artistically challenged ability can not be disputed. As to those who think the burn holes are overly hyped, show me a representation of the Shroud that has real, instead of painted burn holes. The burn holes are the Shroud’s fingerprints.

And then there is this description of an incident when the carbon dating samples were withdrawn: “When the four floodlights were switched on, pointing toward the ceiling, the sudden increase of light caused an immediate reaction from the Superintendent of Cultural Heritage of Turin, who asked to reduce lighting power to avoid damage to the Shroud.” http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf In 1992, Bill Clinton was elected U.S. President with a slogan “It’s the economy, stupid!” It’s only a hypothesis, but just maybe: “it’s the light stupid.” The problem is if the degradation of the linen was caused “light,” we are a very long way from determining the origin of the light and why it would produce such a perfect image. Or are we? Of course, the claim is some clever medieval forger artist scientific genius did this. I hate to sound like a lawyer, but I am one. Let me use an analogy from law. If someone causes an auto accident and there is a great deal of gasoline spilled that accidentally erupts in fire a few minutes later, he is responsible for the fire. However, if a pyromaniac happens by and throws a match causing the fire, the driver who caused the accident is not liable because you can not legally foresee an act of arson.resulting from the accident. The pseudo skeptics claim the shroud is a fraud because they must intellectually rule out authenticity, whatever the facts are. But forgery is a very complicated, independent process, which has been rebutted and the method of transmitting the image is still not proven. Given what we know, a “natural cause” such as light is much more probable than a forger using unknowable science and anatomical information.

Colin’s metaphor “body bag” to indicate that he was wrapped when taken down from the cross may seem a bit cheeky but that’s Colin. However, I did not detect, and maybe I read it too quickly an argument for a second Shroud. There’s is no evidence of that. It is absolutely clear that the body was not fully prepared in the time that it was removed from the cross and first placed in the tomb. And before final preparations the body “disappeared.” “39 And Nicodemus also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight. 40 They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 41 Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had been laid. 42 There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews, they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at hand.” (John 19: 39 42 (Rheims Duoay Kindle Edition) Because the body was not fully prepared it is ridiculous to claim that scripture, or anything else, supports a second authentic shroud. Also, the concept that Nicodemus brought spices and stuff on a donkey that were twigs and leaves is if you pardon the pun, is made up of “whole cloth.” [I am not sure if that’s an Americanism or Shakespeare but it means “not true.”] By the way, I got an education on Wikipedia from a History professor yesterday who was intrigued by the failed attempt by Charles Freedman to post a pseudo third party Wiki entry as to his History Today theory.

The body and the Shroud parted company therefore at a very early time after death. Whatever conditions of the tomb (dampness, cool temperature) that would have extended the time of rigor mortis and delayed putrefaction are almost irrelevant because there is no evidence of such having occurred. So if the conditions of the tomb would have extended the time from 48 hours to several days means only that the event of Resurrection could have occurred later that the approximately 30 hours or so of the Scripture accounts. (9 hours on Friday, 24 hours on Saturday and six hours to daybreak on Sunday). That putrefaction is delayed by cool temperature is a well known fact. In Rogers & Hammerstein’s musical Oklahoma there is a song “Poor Jud is Dead.” The last the verse is: “He’s lookin’ oh so purty and so nice He looks like he’s asleep It’s a shame that he won’t keep But it’s summer and we’re runnin’ out a’ ice” Isabel Piczek described the image as an event horizon. Scientifically, the most commonly known event horizon is the observable last gasp of matter as it is sucked into a black hole. Actually a sunset is a rough metaphor. The sun sinks below the horizon but we know of its presence because the horizon remains light for some moment of time. I think that when it comes to image formation that Jackson’s probably on the right track. None of the theories of image formation that claim to be purely natural work and any theory that obdurately refuses to take into account the Resurrection, probably won’t work. Christ’s body was transforming from state of existence that we know to another that we can’t really explain – yet. The complex theories of consciousness and quantum theory intrude deeply into basic questions that were in the past reserved for religion. Some of them tend towards solipsism – nothing exists until it is perceived and then only in the consciousness of the viewer. Those who insist on a natural explanation for the image formation process without reference to the Resurrection are doomed to fail.

However, there is a point before it is lost in the hole that an approaching object becomes distorted by the gravity and assumes new shapes. The point at which an object’s light can last be observed is called the event horizon. On the case of the Shroud, the image is of a dead Christ. It was formed in a micro second.

All who truly love entangle themselves with the creator. I caution those who rely too heavily on theology divorced from science.

Simplistic rejection of any idea of existence a not being “rational” is shorthand for “Don’t bother me with the facts or any idea that confronts my assumptions with which I am comfortable.” If one looks back through the history of science one is struck at how many advances that ultimately became accepted truth were initially rejected because they were not “rational” according to the wisdom of the time and that includes Einstein (who himself initially rejected much of quantum mechanics because it was not rational.

To say something is true beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that there is no doubt. But it is the doubt that comes in the middle of the night at two o’clock in the morning that we must reject. We need Napoleon referred to as two o’clock in the morning courage. Sunrise is a curative of doubt. But what of the Resurrection? Does the Shroud “prove” the Resurrection. I do believe that it is consistent with Resurrection. That is it does not disprove the Resurrection. But the great unknown s the process of image formation. I think there are twp poles here. One is represented by Jackson, Fanti et al who argue that the process involved in the creation points towards Resurrection and the other by the late Ray Rogers who insisted that he didn’t believe in miracles and searched, fruitlessly for a natural explanation he never successfully articulated (as he himself admitted). So we are at an impasse. But that is not to say the impasse that will never be broken. Science has shed light much of what humanity used to be believe was a miracle. Indeed, Science may in fact be doing God’s handiwork in revealing the true majesty and glory of existence. As Science opens avenues of existence to explore, we should not be too surprised if at the one of those avenues we glimpse the Creator.

I strongly suggest that you read Emanuella Marinelli’s excellent 30 page discussion of the carbon tests. If you still accepts those results of the carbon dating until disproved I would appreciate a point by point rebuttal. Anyone who is so intent on avoiding unpleasant truth such as the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, is not a skeptic but a fool. .Get used to it. Christ was born, Christ was crucified and Christ was buried – in the Shroud now in Turin. Marinelli’s treatise is available for free on some website you may have visited for a few seconds: https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/marinelliv.pdf Incidentally, Martinelli’s paper runs thirty single spaced pages. If you are serious, what we need is a point by point rebuttal, not some statement from the top of a Olympus as a art historian. The problem is that the Shroud it is not a work of art. An art historian has little to add. Neither does any expert on relics who has been too busy to explore and write on it. It was created by a yet undiscovered process but it is clear that it was not a work of art. It bears no marks of human creation. For example: If it was a work of art, was the artists left or right handed? That’s just the first question. I think most art historians examining a medieval piece could answer that question about a medieval piece. About something not created by an artist, I think not. [PS.

How many specific accounts of sch specific individual being buried in a linen shroud. How many specific written accounts of such specific individuals are that that that the specific individual was wrapped in a Shroud and place in a tomb hewn from rock? How many specific accounts of women finding the specific individual’s tomb empty? How many answers to even one of those questions are there? And one more, how many references by a Roman historian are there to a specific executed individual of a cult in Judea that spread to Rome even after there was an attempt to quash it by his execution? I can think of only one individual who meets those criteria. Names please (and sources). Hugh stated in referenced cases “anyone of then might have merited a mock helmet.” Point is there is no record of any of them being crucified with a mock helmet. Here we have written accounts of crucifixion with a mock crown which at the time would have been in the form of a cap rather than a medieval circle of gold or other metal of only one individual. Guess who? There seems to me to be a certain arrogance of true believers who have the “gift of faith” and no need of science. Therefore, they do their best to destroy a scientific road to faith for others. The study of the Shroud is the study of science. I am a Teilhardest in that I believe that science and religion can no longer trod separate paths.

The thrust of the TOF post was history, not science. I look forward to informed comments in this chain on history pre Lirey of the Shroud including expected skeptical denials. – even from Colin. I would hope the skeptics would supply reason for that refutation of the history discussed at length in the TOF post with something more than invective. One of the comments on TOF blog itself was the claim that the posting had plagiarized Markwardt and Scavone. That would be difficult because Markwardt and Scavone have a scholarly disagreement about the timing of the arrival of the Shroud in Constantinople. Markwardt places it there earlier than either Scavone or Wilson has written. Moreover, you can’t plagiarize history. One case on that point was Harry Lincoln’s ill fated lawsuit against Dan Brown. Lincoln was one of the four authors of Holy Blood Holy Grail (HBHG). He claimed that Brown had plagiarized HBHG in the Da Vinci Code because he wrote of the Knights Templar having possession of the Shroud at some point. Brown won the law suit because of a very simple legal proposition: You can’t plagiarize history. What can’t be plagiarized are the author’s words if they are uniquely his or hers. Brown, Scavone and Wilson are writing historical texts. Any event that they report as an historical event can be reported as history by another author, but the second author can not do so in the original author’s unique own words without attribution. Incidentally, to accuse an author of plagiarism without a factual legal basis might be actionable slander. For example, I quote Tacitus, Boris Pasternak and Elaine Pagels in quotations of paragraph length or more in my book Quantum Christ with proper attribution and in Pagel’s case with her explicit permission. The other two authors were deceased at the time of my writing. Were someone to criticize me for saying I plagiarized those authors, that would potentially be a slander. Were they say I had just copied Tacitus or Pasternak, that would not be slander. One omission from the TOF post which is very relevant is a discussion of the Justinian coins that demonstrate “Vignon markings.” Both Wilson and Markwardt have written of them.

When there is a body of circumstantial evidence pointing in one direction, then that body of evidence may allow us to, and in law may force us, to reach a conclusion in that direction. It is an issue of probability, but at the quantum level of existence, everything is an issue of probability. There are well over a scores, it not more than a hundred, of hard facts from which a inference of authenticity. Maybe someone can do the math, I have to make a trip to the law library this morning, but what are the odds that a coin when flipped will come up heads or tails? For one flip it’s 50%. What are the odds that a coin when flipped will come of heads 80 times in a row. I believe the odds are in the line of one in the millions. Your speculations or theories are not facts. A hard fact might be the production of an existing similar object but even that would not be determinant. The only hard fact arguing against authenticity, is the carbon dating. However, that process was so deeply flawed as to become a non fact. As an analogy, in a trial, after extensive examination and testimony, it would probably be excluded from evidence. Seriously. I hate to sound/write like a lawyer, but proving facts by evidence is what I do for a living and have done for more than 50 years.

In began with the Copenhagen interpretation, I believe we are up to eight now, the ;latest one being announced this year “proves” that the others are false – at least the scientists who propounded it said. I really feel sorry for some one who insists on absolute proof which I guess is how some define scientific proof. There are no absolutes. We must live by reasonable belief. Even the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt allows room for unreasonable doubt. To believe only in absolute truth is to believe in nothing. Do you have faith in God. Is it the anthropomorphic God who walked and talked with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden? Do you believe that the disparity of human language was created by human hubris in attempting to build a Tower of Babel? Do you believe in Noah’s Ark in which very animal in the world was saved from a flood ordained by God in a single boat? Do you believe in a God who ordered Joshua to slaughter the women and children of Jericho? I don’t. I believe as St. John wrote: God is love. I believe also that truth will makes us free. And that liberating truth comes from love. I believe that all the commandments and prophecy are founded on love. The embodiment of that love was cruelly tortured and crucified – and rose from the dead by a process we do not yet understand. The scientific evidence of the authenticity of the Shroud demands a response. Not a speculation but one founded on reasonable facts. The only item that approached that was the carbon dating and that has been scientifically rebutted. I believe that the Shroud is a revelation left for this scientific era.

However, the pace of science today and the necessity of collaboration, makes peer review the end of the process, not its beginning. The history of Science is replete with examples of important advances that were ridiculed and rejected by “scientific peers.” If we are to wait for peer reviewed journal articles before examining theories and the facts underlying them, we will seldom advance our knowledge into new theories or unexplained mysteries. One of the errors of the Vatican, was its repression of ideas deemed threatening to orthodoxy. I believe that the biggest tragedy of the Vatican’s forbidding Teilhard de Chardin to publish was a limitation on his ability to fully vet his ideas and through vigorous dialogue harmonize them more completely. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is reviewing its own peer review process. Obviously a peer reviewed journal article has more authority than research results published on the Internet. However, it is important to both the researcher and and those interested in his research to be informed at in early stage. Critiques addressed to the specific findings or procedures are important and can be very helpful. Whether I agree with all the conclusions of the French researchers or not, I appreciate learning of their work and having an opportunity to examine it now, instead of months if not years down the line. After all, it was “peer review” of by the French Academy of Science, of the work of Yves Delage and his protege Paul Vignon that sunk initial scientific investigation of the Shroud of Turin for for decades. They had to wait three decades until 1930 for their vindication. For Delage, it came a decade too late.

Their response to anything that doesn’t square with their dogged agnosticism or atheism is to simply write it off has a hoax. Some decades ago, we had in my hometown (Syracuse) a weeping Mary frenzy that indeed was a a hoax. A pubescent young girl claimed that she had dropped a statute that broke and when she picked it up the head and kissed it, it wept. (It might have been St. Anne, Mary’s putative mother). There was no scientific investigation to speak of for and after a few weeks or a couple of months of hysterical viewings it was found to be a hoax. Later, when I was in high school, one of classmates, who was from the same neighborhood, remarked, “If she kissed me, I would have cried too.” It wasn’t a comment on her looks. Anyone, who dismisses the Shroud image as other than an image of a horribly tortured, crucified man that was by all probability created within three days of his death, is a fool whatever his credentials. Science demonstrates that it IS. (caps not a typo) And the cause of science is not advanced by “scientists” who attack a particular religious belief without doing the science. You wonder why the fundamentalist “young earthers” reject science? The arrogance of lumping all religious belief together with known absurdities may be one reason. It is far easy for them to cling to error than accept the judgment of others that reject willy nilly all religious thought. In the case of climate change, the atheists and agnostics who proselytize for atheism instead of sticking to scince, are as big a danger as those who are driven to reject scientific proof by the arrogance of some scientists.

(I did manage to sneak one of JFK’s most elegant quotes from his speech an American University in Section C, The Challenge to Humanity in Chapter 18, the Challenge of the Shroud “For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children’s futures. And we are all mortal.” John F. Kennedy American University June 10, 1963 The point is there exist establishments that can not, or will not, deal with facts that are incompatible with their world view. In the Kennedy case it is, among others things, much of the mainstream media. In 1993, I wrote a two page Op Ed for Newsday about the phenomenon entitled “Why the Media Want the Inquiries to end.” It was placed by Newsday on the Washington Post LA Times news wire and has been referred to by one Warren report skeptic as the “best short summary of our position.” It may still be cited by other web pages on the Internet See http://www.johnklotz.com/new jfk.htm In the piece I wrote about the NY Times initial attitude about the Warren Report: “When the Warren report was issued in September, 1964, the media greeted it with universal praise. Its most popular edition was published by The New York Times. The introduction, written by Assistant Managing Editor Harrison Salisbury, pronounced, ‘No material question now remains unresolved, as far as the death of President Kennedy is concerned.’ To critics of the Warren Commission, Salisbury flashed a contemptuous warning: Those who spread irresponsible rumors about the assassination were either seeking to sow distrust and confusion among the public or intent on conveying to foreign countries the ‘image of a violent America, helpless in the face of dangerous forces.'” The issues are different and so is the establishment seeking to still threatening voices. In the Shroud’s case it is that part of the the Scientific establishment that can not deal with the possible reality of Jesus Christ and his purported Resurrection. When it comes to the Shroud, JFK is an aside, except what it can teach us about how establishments political or scientific – react to challenges to their world view. The fancy word for the process is “marginalization.” It is certainly at work in the study of the Shroud and the credibility wrongfully bestowed on the carbon dating continues to be the principal method of marginalizing Shroud studies. Yet, in neither the Kennedy casen or the Shroud, has the marginalization ended debate or study. Thank God!

While I can be critical of various popes, I think this is a bad rap. If anything, the Church is too often sweeping with a broad brush in its pronouncements. Georges Lemaitre was a priest scientists who first proposed the big bang theory of the creation of the Universe. He was for many ears the subject of scorn from other scientists. The atheists agnostics wanted a Universe that always was and was never never. Pope Pius XI wrote to Lemaitre that he has “proven” Genesis and the creation of the Universe by God. Lemaitre demurred. He cautioned the pope to be careful. Any scientific theory that is true today may be disproved tomorrow. Pius XI was indeed a remarkable man. As a young priest he had climbed the Alps with a young French man named Paul Vignon. That was before Vignon had a breakdown from which emerged the man we (at least all most all of us) honor for his work on the Shroud.Pius XI also wrote an encyclical attacking the Hitler and the Nazi’s that was released in late 1938 after his death. But Lemaitre was right, the Church must be careful before declaring any work of scholarship as true or false as a matter of faith. Again, I believe that it has been too quick to reveal truth at times. What it must be is open. The case of Galileo is an excellent example. Then too, there was Joan of Arc. Garry Wills placed St. Peters martyrdom at the time of Nero. He may have been a flaming torch at a Nero bacchanalia. He was probably betrayed by other Christians. So too was Paul. I realize that there are other scholars much more knowledgeable than I who on this blog who might have differing views, But I find the Church’s attitude of cautious reverence to be quite appropriate. On the other hand, the bones of St. Peter are not the singular Shroud of Turin. The Crucifixion of Christ as “King of the Jews” was a singular event. There were undoubtedly in sum thousands of martyrs. There are thousands of martyrs being suffering this day at the hands of radical Islamists (not all Moslems by any means). The claims of crucifixion and the details of crucifixion are set forth in four written accounts that date to traditions which arose at the time of his death and resurrection. We may have lost the earliest written accounts but the existence of the traditions is attested to not just the Gospels but by the martyrdom of those who proclaimed the Resurrection and faced sure death as a result. I may be on dangerous found here, but I am not willing to accept on as a matter of faith the opinion of one scholar as to the identity of St. Peter’s bones. That’s not duplicity.

It is one think to argue against authenticity, it is another to paint with a broad brush those who disagree with you as ignorant or superstitious. That really is unacceptable and it provides no room for debate. If there is one thing the members of the STURP team were not it was “ignorant or superstitious.” The late John Heller when he was a Yale undergraduate was chosen in a special program to be advised by Einstein in Princeton 150 miles or so south of Yale. He began his work on the Shroud convinced that the Shroud was a fake. He changed his mind. It was not ignorance or superstition that changed his mind but the blood analysis that he and Al Adler did. They were fanatic about checking their observations with other colleagues for critiques. (So was Ray Rogers.) In my book, I quote from his memoir a moment when they reached out to other colleagues to check on their results: “Heller decided to check the results with at least two other top hemoglobin experts and see if they would be a sure as he and Adler were. “Adler got on the phone immediately and read the coordinates to his chosen specialist. The answer – old acid methemoglobin. Then they called Bruce Cameron on a speaker – phone. His double doctorate was dedicated to hemoglobin in all its many forms. After they had given him the numbers and plotted them, Cameron was a little sharp. ‘You both should know what it is. It’s old acid methemoglobin.

Is it wrong to rely on science to either support or deny faith? There is an attitude that faith must stand independent of science and that those who attempt to harmonize faith and science are somehow lesser Christians. I guess I am guilty of this. For the better part of two millenia faith had demanded that we accept a story of the Garden of Eden and the forbidden fruit as the source the “original sin” which tained all of humanity. Had it not been for Adam and Eve there would have been no death and no work. We know know that that was a metaphor. Advanced theologians who were also scientists like Pierre teilhard de Chardin sought to redefine the faith in terms of evolution. The scientist who first proposed the “Big Bang” theory was a Belgium priest who was excoriated by the scientific community including some atheists. I think we are long past the moment when we should flee scientific proof of the authenticity of the Shroud. We do not organize our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. To say, I turn my back on science because my faith has no doubt is to limit your world and your faith. (That is not an accusation of you, Louis, it’s just something I read and hear from others.) By all the standards of evidence we use in law, the evidence that the Shroud is authentic is overwhelming except for the disputed carbon dating. The atheists cling to carbon dating the way some believers cling to their inerrant bible. Better, perhaps, to “Cling to that Old Rugged Cross.” Science is now approaching the complex question of human consciousness of self and its nature. The answer will lie in the Quantum realm, I believe. Genesis says that we are created in the image and likeness of God. That likeness is not our hands and our feet but our consciousness.

Provenance refers to the origin and/or history of an object. One point that de Wesselow made his book the Sign was that in dealing with ancient works establishing the provenance meaning the origin and history is sometimes difficult, if not impossible. But let me use the Latin phrase “res ipsa loquitur” in context. The facts speak for themselves. In this case the facts are the physical existence of the Shroud and their attributes and what those physical attributes demonstrate. When one looks at the sum of those attributes it is pretty hard not to reach the conclusion that it is the burial cloth of a horribly tortured and crucified man. From the circumstances it’s reasonable to conclude that man was Jesus Christ. The only important fact on the other side of the ledger is the carbon dating. Ray Rogers and others showed why that may be wrong and Ray Rogers came up with a “fact” that pseudo skeptics seem to ignore. The complete absence of vanillin in the larges part of the Shroud indicating that it was at least 1500 years old, not 700 years. However, how many times impeached, the pseudo skeptics push the carbon dating button. I use the phrase “pseudo” skeptic, because they are not truly skeptics searching for truth. They are the truest believers, but their belief is atheism. Nothing that contradicts their view can be tolerated. So in one context, whatever you might say about the history of the Shroud is almost irrelevant. Who cares? Maybe Caligula used it as a shower curtain? Maybe Simon the Magician stole it because he could sell it for a mint and then somebody else stole it back. Maybe it was abducted by aliens in a UFO and then returned because it wasn’t worth much in the market place of Polaris’third planet. Maybe it was worshipped by the Knights Templar or the Knights of Malta. Maybe the Popes used it as a bed sheet. Who cares? The physical facts of what is here and now are what we can rely on. All the rest, to paraphrase Rabbi Hillel, is commentary. It’s provenance will always be in dispute for there can never be an conclusive path proven from the Tomb to Turin. But what fascinates me is its providence. The image on the Shroud while interesting and inspiring through medieval time to the present age of science could have taught very little until the advances of science in the past 115 years. And now, in this skeptical era science has caught up with the Shroud. The scientific study of the Shroud has become a revelation, rather a Revelation. Is it coincidental? Or was the image left there for discovery now? Is the issue provenance. Or providence? Is it an accident, or the product of a consciousness beyond our understanding? Does it matter which is true (or both)..","date":"2012-05-31","mins":"9:38 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/31/comment-promoted-ray-schneider-on-charles-freeman-sturp/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Comment Promoted: Ray Schneider on Charles Freeman & STURP"},{"id":"comment-146767","author":"john_klotz","post":"Dan, I believe that based upon Colin’s long winded threat, you should rally reconsider whether Colin is an appropriate contributor to blog comment section.

I believe, and I have written, that “If the Shroud of Turin is authentic, it is arguably the important object on the face of the earth with the possible exception of nuclear weapons.” Humanity now faces an apocalypse. Last year, there was a flood of of scientific reports confirming that selfish exploitation of the environment has unleashed processes that will ultimately render human life untenable. Christ sacrificed himself but he did so because it is his Resurrection that promises to each of us that selfless sacrifice is the path to the primordial consciousness from which our existence sprang, in other words God. Pray now, that Pope Francis lives a longer life than one might expect. He realizes that.

In Quantum Christ I quoted Sir Roger Penrose (Nobel Laureate) and Dr. Stuart Hameroff: “Consciousness implies awareness: subjective experience of internal and external phenomenal worlds. Consciousness is central also to understanding, meaning and volitional choice with the experience of free will. Our views of reality, of the universe, of ourselves depend on consciousness. Consciousness defines our existence.” (Emphasis added) Teilhard de Chardin defines the human species as the singular species which has a reflective consciousness. Not just that we are aware of our existence but that we are aware that we are aware. Sir Bertrand Russell was wrote that solipsism – the belief that the only relevant existence is that we consciously perceive and thus create – is the only defensible philosophy. There is a legendary anecdote that has been reported in different guises that a woman wrote him to express her gratitude for his enunciating his position because “I thought I was the only one ho believed that.” Solipsism is my opinion is the underlying explanation for Ayn Rand’s Egoism and Friedrich Nietzsche’s nihilism. I fled from it. In my book “Quantum Christ” I defined God as the primordial consciousness from which our existence sprang. I do not retreat from the definition but now I think I can clarify it further: God is the primordial solipsist. He is the big box of consciousness into which all the little boxes of consciousness are contained and that includes each of us. Some years ago I read that quantum science was demonstrating that underlying our existence was the law of probability theory. Incidentally, Richard Dawkins agrees with that. I was aghast and so was Einstein before he died. But I asked myself a question: Whose law is the law of probability? I think I am challenged now to write this more explicitly. Maybe I am being challenged by that great solipsist in the sky to do it? Perhaps, I should get a grip. Your use of ancient numerology is difficult to accept carte blanche.

Yet what makes the post so important is his marshalling of many of the circumstances of the crucifixion exhibited on the Shroud that would be beyond the competence or knowledge of a medieval forger or any forger without extensive historical, medical, biological, horticultural and scientific knowledge unknown until the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is an exhibition of circumstantial evidence that is not only compelling, but in my viewpoint conclusive as to the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin as burial cloth of Jesus Christ. Part of his posting contains the listing of 28 items exhibited by the Shroud that are clearly “circumstances” of the Shroud pointing to its authenticity. You may quibble (as I do) about some of the circumstances and their implication but unless you can defeat all 28 circumstances you are left with the conclusion that an important body of circumstantial evidence that supports authenticity. How many” 24?, 20?, 10?, 5?, 3? How many circumstances must a prosecutor prove that someone is guilty of murder once you have the body of a dead person killed by a gunshot.? (1) We gun that fired the fatal bullet (proven) by ballistics. (2) We have an accused fingerprints on the gun. There is no convincing evidence of circumstances exonerating the accused (alibi etc). Maybe someone would demand more circumstances, but on appeal, I do not think a jury verdict of guilty would be overturned. As to that part based on ancient numerology, I would have difficulty using it as proof.

From a set of observations, none of which conclusively proves something, we can draw a conclusion of another fact that the set of facts are consistent with and that with which any contrary conclusion is inconsistent. The Spicer thesis ties together a great many other theories and speculations. It may be a thesis of that explains the “Kirlian aura” effect as a cause of the image. “An alternative but perhaps less likely theory is that the imprint resulted from a “Kirlian effect” or other unknown quality of Christ’s body; the aura of light and the rare condition of haematidrosis (bloody sweat) recorded of Christ may be cited in this regard.aura” William Meacham, http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm. Meacham is an archaeologist who has written extensively about the Shroud and was an expert critic of the carbon dating (I am sure most readers of the blog will know who Bill Meacham is.) The importance of the image is not the process of its creation which may not be “miraculous” as that term is normally used. It is what the image displays or doesn’t display. It doesn’t display evidence of putrefaction byproducts and does display evidence of rigor mortis. The two are related. Rigor mortis is a freezing of the muscles into their configuration at the time of death or a short time afterwards. Putrefaction is a degeneration of body tissues and is evidenced by the exuding of chemicals that would be obviously present on a shroud and lead to pronounced degradation of a shroud. Although times for each may very, it is not a leap of logic to assume they are related. 48 hours in the normal course is reasonable time to expect thee onset of putrefaction and the release of rigor mortis. Let see. 48 hours from 3:00pm on a Friday is 3:00 PM on the following Sunday afternoon. If a body had remained enwrapped in the Shroud of Turin until 3:00 PM Sunday and the image created at that time or later there would be in all probability no evidence of rigor mortis and some evidence of putrefaction. Numerous examinations of the Shroud image by expert forensic pathologists have found neither evidence of putrefaction nor the release of rigor mortis.

It seems to me that some individuals are too comfortable with a science faith dichotomy that they too easily reject the intrusion of one or another into the world view. Thus the Resurrection is an event not subject to scientific investigation and analysis because it can’t be repeated. Almost every one on either side of the science faith dichotomy recognizes now that the universe as we know it began with a “big bang.” Yet, it is not a repeatable event and our understanding of it is more an application of mathematics to physical observations. [If any one knows a scientist trying to replicate the Big Bang, please ask him to stop.] Now!!! Just as the creation of the universe was once a matter of faith and is now a matter of science even though we can’t repeat it, I would suggest that there are aspects of the Resurrection “theory” are examinable by scientific theory. It begins with a form of matter (a body) that is transformed into something we do not yet have an explanation of other than through faith. But that transformation happened in the here and now and everything up to the moment of transformation is subject to scientific and historical analysis. This of course brings us to the Shroud of Turin and its image which I believe gives circumstantial support to the Resurrection in that it was created before rigor mortis was released on the body and byproducts of putrefaction existed that would degrade the cloth. There is no question I believe that means that the body and the Shroud parted company. Circumstantially, the Resurrection is consistent with Shroud and the Shroud is inconsistent with almost any other hypothesis. I applaud the efforts of scientists like Jackson and his colleagues who are seeking an explanation of how the image was created. That the theories advance involve “natural” phenomena doesn’t detract one whit from the “miracle” that was the Resurrection just as the hypothesis of the Big Bang detracts from faith that at the core of our existence was a primordial consciousness from which our existence evolved.

He claimed that it would take an enormous amount of “contamination” to have skewed the C 14 results. The problem is that the critics of the C 14 tests address was not “contamination” but the presence of a rewoven linen and repairs. Contamination might an appropriate description of the bio plastic coating theory but it simply does not apply to the work of Ray Rogers and virtually every other commentator since the landmark Benford Marino report of 2000. Rogers found THAT THE LINEN in the are was NEW because of substantial differences with the linen in the body of the Shroud. Also, it was dyed UNLIKE the linen in the main body of the Shroud. The cotton was present because the linen didn’t hold the dye and the cotton is what gave the patch color. Apparently Jackson had stepped out for coffee when Pam Moon of GB earlier gave an excellent presentation on new examinations of pictures of the underside of the Oxford sample that pretty conclusively demonstrated dramatic differences with the main body of the Shroud. What Jackson and the company want to do is throw the dice on a theory that will “prove” the Resurrection. There theory may even be correct. But to move that theory forward in a desperate attempt to “prove” the Resurrection is a fools errand. Perhaps I am being impolitic. But the search for truth is often impolitic. Frankly, Sunday morning’s highlight was the clash between Jack Markwardt and Dan Scavone about the early history of the Shroud. In case anyone wasn’t listening, Professor Scavone’s presentation which followed Markwardt’s had one item that seemed to verify Markwardt’s basic point: that an inventory of the Constantinople relics before 1204 listed two different relics: a Sudarium and a Sindone.

I even blogged a piece in June 2011 which demonstrated its use and related it to the Shroud of Turin: THE SHROUD OF TURIN, THE RESURRECTION AND JOE KENNEDY, http://johnklotz.blogspot.com/2011/06/shroud of turin resurrection and joe.html It is more or less the heart of the first chapter of my book which deals with how we can reasonable draw conclusions from circumstantial evidence and as Dawkins notes we sometimes have to. In sum, from two facts recited in the third verse of the lyrics written by Ira Gershwin, reasonable conclude, and I would submit beyond a reasonable doubt, that Gershwin was twitting Joseph Kennedy, the father of US President John Kennedy. The two facts: (a) in 1929 I sold short and in (b) In England I am presented in Court. Cutting to chase, I submit with 100% confidence that of tyhe over 100 billion huamns who have walked the face of the Earth since the human race emrged from evolution, nly one – Joseph P. Kennedy fits those two facts. I guess the odds that he is not would be 1 in a 100,000,000,000. Obviously, the issue of Shroud authenticity is a much more complex issue. However, its an accumulation of facts, that lead inevitability to the conclusion that the Shroud is authentic. Some are quite strong and some are more weak. You can not reach a conclusion without taking into account the totality of the evidence. It’s something that we do every day of our life. To quote the first sentence of my book: “We do not order our lives by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” In a UN debate back in the day, the USSR Ambassador twitted the UN Ambassador for retitevly quoting himself.

The first sentence of my book is “We do not order our lives by proof beyond reasonable doubt.” Nonetheless we do make decisions. I have spent my professional career dealing with proving and disproving things. When I graduated law school, I won an award for the best contribution by a senior student to the law review. It was a note on the evidentiary principle of res ipsa loquitur: the facts speak for themselves. My principal point was that res ipsa was simply an application of the rules of circumstantial evidence. I appreciate the fact that it would be a bit of arrogance (if not simony) for me to insist that you buy by book. So here’s a freebee. The arguments about authenticity drawn from my book in the guise of a review of the CNN production of CNN’s Funding Jesus is available on the web at no cost at http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/klotzcnn.pdf (I do not know if that TV program was available across the pond). Excuse my self absorption if I cite that piece as “Klotz”). I will now give you a lecture (I’m not nearly as arrogant as I write) on the Shroud and circumstantial evidence citing four physical objects three of which are in physical existence today and one of which we have available only through a painting of it. The three which physically exist to day are (1) the Shroud of Turin; (Klotz p. 4), (2) The Pray Codex in Budapest Hungary. (Klotz p. 5) and (3) an illustration in the prayer book of Margaret of France (Klotz p. 3). The one which is not in existence but of which we have a painting is the Lier Shroud. (Klotz p. 5). There is no question that three of them are artistic representations and one of them is NOT an artistic representation but actually has burn holes surrounded by a charred ring. (See illustration Klotz P. 4) It should be no surprise that the one with actual burn holes is the Shroud of Turin. Two things of interest about the Lier Shroud. It was created before the fire in 1532 and does not therefore evidence the patches sewn on by the Poor Sister of St. Clare. Neither does the Pray Codex. Here’s the kicker in my view, the painting of the Lier Shroud shows the degrading of the burn holes from layer to layer. Neither the Pray Codex NOR Margaret’s prayer book has that verisimilitude. I believe it was Colin Berry who refereed to the Pray Codex as “over hyped.” I do not know what that means scientifically. It is what it is. Those who wish to denigrate it with elegant invective conveniently ignore the facts. In the upper left hand corner of the drawing is a figure with a cloth draped over his shoulder. It’s actually two illustrations. The top part is the burial of Jesus and it shows, inter alia, Joseph of Arimethea. The bottom part is an Angel announcing the Resurrection to the Mary Magdalene and the women who accompanied her. The important point is the consistency of the burn hole configuration among all four items: the original Shroud and the three representations with the Lier Shroud actually showing variations of the holes through four layers. The conclusion to be reached by this circumstantial evidence is I believe unassailable and actually reaches proof beyond reasonable doubt standards. The Shroud predates the time period allowed by the carbon dating.

That science has revealed to us the meaning of the blood stains and the image at this pint in human history, is also … providential. We are literally facing the possible, if not inevitable, apocalyptic extinction of the humanity. The engine of our extinction is the selfish abuse of the environment empowered by advances in science. Our survival now depends on extraordinary, unprecedented and perhaps impossible acts of individual and collective selflessness. Science whose inventions have brought us to the brink of extinction can, if properly harnessed, give us the tools to pull us back. What the Shroud teaches by example the power of love to conquer selfishness and death in even the most dire circumstances. Because the evolution that drove the development of our reflective consciousness was driven by selfishness it may very well have been necessary that God his/herself had to give the example of selfless love through the death and resurrection of Christ. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. No simple human could have given the necessary example. The real miracle and revelation is that Christ partakes of our human nature. One of the jotys of my life is to hear on Christmas eve a line of from O Holy night that may sum up the mystery and revelation of Christ for us all: “Long lay the world in sin and error pining; till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.” In an E Mail today, John Jerpe had the following insight: “[T]he present state of the world is such that habitual warfare and weaponized technology increase the probability of something apocalyptic. If we already know that the human community might “self destruct”, perhaps the Shroud (and the Man in it) are saying that there exists dormant within the human organism an energy source we have not even conceptualized yet, hence the image. I.e. Is the Man in the Shroud simply Jesus or is the man in the Shroud you and I?” The Shroud matters not because Christ was God, it matters becasue it testifies and reveals that he was also human – just as you and I..","date":"2015-05-21","mins":"10:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/05/21/john-klotz-the-blind-men-the-elephant-and-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"John Klotz, the Blind men, the Elephant and the Shroud of Turin"},{"id":"comment-199941","author":"john_klotz","post":"Fascinating story Louis.

By the way, do you have any opinion on Hans Berger and his experience with his sister. There are other similar experiences of individuals, particularly in the stress of wartime. Let me give you one I learned of from a friend who served in Viet Nam. A woman stateside awoke during the night to the sound of a rifle shot. That’s all she heard. Subsequently she learned that her husband in Viet Nam had died from a rifle shot at the very moment she was awakened. If our consciousness is a quantum phenomenon can they not become entangled with other phenomenon. Is that not description of love? I believe that science can supply answers to some of these mysteries. And I quote Russ Breault who lectures on the Shroud and appeared in the History Channel production of the Real Face of Jesus: “I call the Shroud the X Files of Christianity. Could this 14 foot long linen cloth have captured the greatest paranormal event of all time?” I appreciate your taking the time to critique my piece. You raise issues that I will have to consider although I do not believe that anyone speaks ex cathedra in this area. The description of Newton being deterministic is not original to me. Neither is the concept that Quantum Mechanics is not deterministic. At the least, I will sharpen my references so that if any one has a beef they can go to the source and understand that they are not arguing with me but the source I have relied on.

However, in discussing the inner/outer of things the inner existence is consciousness. That is not an ephemeral, can’t be studied or proven theological construct. That is science and everything I wrote applies. This is something I wrote in the introduction to the manuscript: “Science attempting to explain human consciousness is science attempting to define what the religious call the soul.” I stand by that.

Morstyn R. Abstract Most psychodynamic theories are based on Freud’s models of mental dynamics which were significantly influenced by Newtonian physics. Freud’s attempts to use the then current scientific metaphors led to theoretical and clinical dilemmas particularly in deep psychotherapy and especially with borderline patients. The author argues that as Newtonian principles are useful for describing macroscopic reality, so Freud’s Newtonian constructs are useful to a certain depth of therapy. Beyond that point, scientific metaphors can be retained but the appropriate metaphors are those of quantum physics. Quantum metaphors are used to explore duality, free will and patient therapist interaction.

In Heller’s book after he and Adler had reached a conclusion based on upon their investigation,using a microspectrophotometer for which they had to go through two colleagues to arrange a test. The results indicated old acid methemoglobin an clear indicia of old, ancient blood. As qualified as they were, they each consulted with another expert. Two more opinions: ancient blood. “Then they called Bruce Cameron on a speaker – phone. His double doctorate was dedicated to hemoglobin in all its many forms. After they had given him the numbers and plotted them, Cameron was a little sharp. “You both should know what it is. It’s old acid methemoglobin.

Are you two idiots working on the Shroud of Turn?” This is drawn from Heller’s book as cited and quoted in Chapter 9 of my work in progress. The working title of the Chapter is “The Blood of the Lamb.” “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Revelations 7:14 The white robes of today are white coats of the lab technicians. I have my own expert I consult who is a physicist, not a chemist, but he did a little checking and before I researched any of the above he advised me that ancient blood would degrade to methemoglobin. I was stunned when I read the passage from Heller. It confirmed what my own “expert” had told me thirty four years later.

Whatever Colin’s credentials, and they may be impressive in his field, he is apparently using makeshift apparatus. Does he actually work in his kitchen? I thought I saw that once. John Brown worked in his dinning room, but he had one his advanced microscopes there. Ray Rogers did not rely on his expertise and devices which far exceed what Colin has at his disposal. Moreover, he didn’t rely on his own findings and sought verification from others including John Brown and Robert Villarreal. Brown was a retired Principal Research Scientist at Georgia Tech Research Institute who had his own Scanning Electronic Microscope at his home. He reproduced pictures of fibers from the Raes patch at 3650 X and 3300 X magnification. You can look at them yourself, at this very instant. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/brown1.pdf Robert(o) Villarreal reported on his results twice: once at the 2008 Ohio Conference http://www.ohioshroudconference.com/a17.htm and again at the 2012 Valencia Conference http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/villarrealvtxt.pdf Villarreal was consulted by Rogers shortly before he died and he was given a sample thread by Rogers. But before he could any test Rogers passed away. He asked Roger’s wife Joan what he should do and she said she was too distraught to deal with it. He heard nothing more until contacted by Barrie Schwortz who was de facto Rogers’ scientific executor. Barrie delivered to Villarreal, among other things, a sample thread from the carbon sample area which held back by Riggi and Gonella. The thread samples Virreal then had were examined by: 1. X ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy 2. Tube Excited and Radioactive Source Micro spot Energy Dispersive X Ray Fluorescence (MXRF) Spectrometry 3. High and Low Powered Magnification with a High Resolution Photo Microscope 4. Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR) with Reflectance Mode Capability 5. Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (TOF SIMS) In each one of those tests he was assisted by scientists from Los Alamos, Berry says “forget STURP, forget Rogers” on no other basis then his skepticism. He has never had in his possession a sample of any kind from the actual Shroud as Rogers, Brown, Villarreal and Schwortz did. People like to cite Occam’s Razor for various propositions, none of which actually originated with William of Okkam. Let me put it this way. Fraud and Falsehood are usually more complex than the truth. Unless you have grounds to believe that Ray Rogers, Sue Benford, Joe Marino, John Brown,. Robert Villarreal and Barrie Schwortz were participating in a fraud that scanned 14 years (from Orvieto to Valencia) you have no basis to ignore their results as Berry does. Frankly, I am reminded of Christ’s retort to Mary and Joseph when as a boy, he had abandoned them to discuss scripture with the elders of the Temple: “Do you not know I must be about my father’s business.” His Father is also our Father. In studying the shroud, we are about His business. We can not, as I am once again, allow Berry to distract us from His business with a whistling tea pot. There is too much real science to do.

Your statement which is of course libelous per se on this side of the Atlantic had you named just one living person who was “evil, insincere, deceitful,etc” Such a personal attack is totally unwarranted by any facts you have stated. One thing I have stated about Heller is that he had “soul.” In an inner US city, that is the highest of praise. I guess I’m a little partial to the term since at one time in my career, I was representing Latino insurgents against the corrupt Bronx political machine in the South Bronx. After one argument in court, an African American Council member who was also a minister remarked to an acquaintance: “I never knew Klotz had soul.” I have had a number of compliments in my career but I was touched by that one. Of course primo uno compliment came from the presiding judge of the New York State Court who introduced to me to “his attorney” as “one the ten best lawyers in Manhattan.” That was probably hyperbole, but the my “soul” compliment about Heller is a measure of my esteem for the late John Heller. If you have truly read Heller’s book, and not come away with personal admiration, if not for his book than the man, you are surely in sorry state. I am spent too much time on this blog this weekend. It’s been a distraction. However when I come to appropriate time to write a about pseudo skeptics in my book, this interchange will play a role.

Whatever your infatuation with Walter Mc Crone, for years he used is “debunking” of the Yale Vinland map as a credential. It was one of the things that impressed STURP members early on. Gove in his memoir after discussing the Shroud with Mc Crone in 1977 78, concluded he was seeking to polish his credentials withe proving the Shroud a fake. You may may feel John Heller an unreliable witness or scientist, you sight one individual and rush to the 1973 test which Heller found to be unreliable. I believe Heller to be a very credible scientist. Gove’s dish of Heller in his memoir would be laighable if it were not, I will use the word “dishonest.” Also, the earliest work on the Shroud by STURP scientists before there was even a formal STURP revealed a lack of “directionality ” in the image. Also the image is finer than any known paint brush (cf Heller again). Mc Crone frantically came up with various theories and theories about it being a painting, but none of them flew. And eventually his findings on the Vinand map were challenged. Here’s were you have an near insurmountable problem: the Shroud is not a work of art. As far as the Byzantine is concerned (depending on how you define Byzantine, Paul Vidnon who was among the first scientific scholars to report on the Pia photos also rejected it as a work of art. Vignon was also an accomplished artist. Later, he published a book at the start of of World War II that examined in great detail the relationship of the image of the Shroud to what I assume you mean by Byzantine. Vignon’s book was an elaborate expensive production and was never translated into English. I was privileged to examine a copy at the NY Public Library., two years ago. However Vignon’s work was first noticed by Walsh and then popularized by Ian Wilson and his examination of the Vignon markings has been quite sophisticated. Not all the markings are representive in each piece of Byzantine art and some are included and some not in various places. About the history of art you might have something to contribute. However, with all due respect, you have a habit of trashing those who reach conclusions different than yours. I.e. Thomas de Wesellow. For some reason you review of his book “The Sign” had disappeared from the Amazon page on the The Sign. Am I correct on that? My last attempt to find it was unsuccessful. Perhaps I didn’t go deep enough. If you can as an art historian identify the school or tradition from which the Shroud image might have come, it might be helpful. In From Christ to Coke, Martin Kemp attempted to do a cursory examination and I would submit failed miserably. But that’s my opinion and I shall address it later. Kemp, when not being cursory, is in fact an excellent art historian and his work as an appraiser can involve some deep science. No so in the case of his Shroud appraisal. I will write about that in my manuscript. Now I have to get to court.

However, I have one reservation about blood. Not that new work is needed but that blood hasn’t been demonstrated. There is nothing you’ve said but you seem to ignore or overlook the conclusions of Heller and Adler which were published in a peer reviewed journal. . When I first started the path, someone whose initials are in fact BS suggested I should read John Heller’s Report on the Shroud of Turin. It is the most authoritative work on STURP written and Heller was a gifted writer. He was not at the 120 hours of Turin but he became a part of STURP a two months before they departed for Rome and in the ensuing three years labored mightily to resolve the issues of the the blood stains He did the blood work on the samples Rogers took that were temporarily absconded by Walter Mc Crone. Adler was brought into STURP by Heller. Heller, as I have mentioned from time to time was a Yale graduate who in his undergraduate days was chosen by Yale to be advised by Einstein at Princeton. He tries to modestly brush it off as a fluke bit it was hardly that. The best summation of STURP and what it did and frankly a measure of Heller’s soul is what I quote at length and call his Valedictory: “The images are the result of dehydrative acid oxidation of the linen. The blood is human blood. How the images got on the cloth is a mystery. We would love to have the answer to this mystery, to explain the science of .it. If it turns out that some form of molecular transport we have not been able to fathom is a method whereby the images of the scourge, crucified man were transferred to the linen, we shall have solved only another little micro part of the puzzle. “We do know, however, that there are thousands upon thousands of pieces of funerary linen going back two millennia before Christ and another huge number of linens of Coptic Christian burials. On none of these is there any image of any kind. A few have some blood and stains on them, but no image. “However, there are some remarkable aspects to this voyage of discovery. The team itself – its formation, cohesion, diversity, collaboration, as well as his sacrifice of time, talent and treasure – is unique in scientific annals. “The role of “coincidence” is awesome. “Science undertook its specialty, which is measurement. We were supremely confident that the answers would – indeed must – be forthcoming. And we fail. “Many team members were ordered or threatened to desist from the project, yet they persevere. Though it was believed that there would be a confrontation between science and religion, none occurred. Rather the relationship was harmonious and synergistic. “All of us have been changed by the project. I believe we have grown. “Some years ago, a friend of mine said to me in exasperation, ‘Heller, why don’t you spend less time in Athens and more in Jerusalem?’ “I find the Acropolis much less interesting these days.” Dr. John H. Heller passed away December 13, 1995. I truly wish I could have known this man. As we say stateside: “He had soul.”.","date":"2013-11-03","mins":"8:00 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/02/consider-rogers/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Consider Rogers"},{"id":"comment-49708","author":"john_klotz","post":"I overlooked your last comment on genetics.

If are are a serious critic of STURP or a serious proponent of their findings, you MUST read Heller’s book to get a real grasp of what happened as well as the interplay of what happened. For example, Heller was quite critical of Mc Crone and essentially said that he tied to steal Rogers’ samples. He was supposed to look at them, make his findings and then forward them to Heller. He didn’t do that. He sent him three slides and kept the rest. Jackson and Rogers had to go to Chicago and physically retrieve them. He also was sloppy in his handling. The most appropriate critique of Heller’s work might be that Mc Crone had messed up the samples – except that Heller and Adler were able to work around that klutz Mc Crone’s mess. : ) And incidentally, in Grove’s memoir he indicates that Mc Crone was out to prove the Shroud a fake from the get go.

You can be a skeptic if you want but if that means you weigh Mc Crone’s words equally with Heller and Rogers and the rest of the STURP team, you are a fool. That is very strong language but there comes when there are competing versions of the truth totally at odds, you must either make a judgment of confess you just don’t know. The scientific evidence that the Shroud is not a painting is conclusive – beyond a reasonable doubt. And I don’t say that about everything involving the Shroud. There many things that some Shroud scholars believe they see that may be highly imaginative. Heller and Adler do not belong to that category. Rogers trusted him and he betrayed Rogers. Others have commented on his twisting of Rinaldi’s words. His book was a terrible mishmash without discernible organization. A collection of literary curios. His misreading of Rinaldi was even too much for Gove not to notice. If you put your prestige into defending the indefensible Mc Crone, you must value your prestige lightly.

John wrote: “God is love.” I believe in the reality of that in some ways that might seem both arcane and hyper modern. It’s a quantum thing. Christ gave us two commandments taken from scripture but combined in a unique way. They were to love God with our whole being and to love our neighbor as ourselves. That’s it. But what does it mean to love both God and neighbor? How does one “love” a disembodied spirit existing before space and time and beyond our comprehension. Christ nswered that question in the parable of the Last Judgment. [So described by Pope Benedict and Pope Francis]. When one reads the litany of deeds that enable salvation, there are some things lacking. No where is tithing raised as a necessary deed, nor even honoring the Sabbath. Rather only through the works of love to the neediest CAN we express our love of the deity. Pope Francis realizes this. That’s why he saw Jesus in the person of a young Moslem delinquent girl whose feet he washed during his first Holy Week as pope. Mother Theresa found Christ in the desperate neediest in the slums of Calcutta. It a real test to love the neediest, particularly if he or she is a homeless person on the subway who hasn’t bathed in a while and who, frankly, smells awful. But that’s what Christianity is about. At least that’s what Christ said Christianity is about.

That means I sometimes find myself in coalition with individuals who have different world views than mine, sometimes very profoundly different views (i.e. Really old Left). My politics come from a dissertation by a man named Matthew which is a part of the book called the New Testament.

There is another recent book touching on the Shroud by an art historian (this time an Oxonian) Martin Kemp: “From Christ to Coke.” In it Kemp recognized the power of the Christ icon and notes the strange transformation that occurred circa 300 CE when in changed from curly haired Roman or Greek to the Pantocrator. He then disses Ian Wilson’s Edessa theory and opines that the Shroud was the work of a medieval artist from Northern Italy or France. It’s “balderdash,” (That’s a nice anglo saxon insult.

Pathology is not his discipline so in a sense he can ignore it. It is the pathologists who have examined the Shroud in the past 80 years have made two observations: (1) the image is a man in a state of rigor mortis and (2) there is no evidence of significant by products of putrefaction. The two are related: the process of putrefaction releases rigor mortis. What this means is that image was probably created with 48 hours of the death of the man in the image; before 3:00 pm, Sunday. If you go to Shroud.com and search for the word “pathologist” it will generate 102 hits. Among the most thorough are the reports of Dr. Robert Bucklin. We should all be thankful for De Wesselow giving his insights as an art historian. However, to answer the questions about the nature of the Shroud and its meaning we must go beyond art history for the simple reason, as De Wesselow I believe demonstrates convincingly, the Shroud is not a work of art..","date":"2015-06-13","mins":"10:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/12/thomas-de-wesselow-on-why-the-image-is-unlikely-by-an-artist/","cat":"video","title":"Thomas De Wesselow On Why the Image is Unlikely by an Artist"},{"id":"comment-201963","author":"john_klotz","post":"There are times when this blog is truly educational and other times when the trolls blather.

Pathologists have placed the moment of the image creation within three days of Christ’s death. The body is in a state of rigor mortis with no external sign of putrefaction. Ray Rogers has estimated that even by a mallard reaction, the image must have been formed in a minute fraction of a second. Yes, the Shroud image is “functional equivalent” of photograph but it is not a photograph. Photographs do not exhibit the differences in image intensity directly related to distance that the Shroud does. To me that would seem to destroy the concept of an imprint by contact. If the imprint was by contact, would that not mean that there would be no differences in intensity? Today the drafts of Pope Francis’s ground breaking encyclical “Laudato Si’” have been leaked to the press. He is not evade, and in fact adopts, the position that human activity is responsible for global warming. While we do not yet know how far he will go discussing the ultimate effects of climate change, others have already written that we face a sixth mass extinction of species that may/will include humanity.

Perhaps the sour pusses could stop sucking on heir lemons and rejoice. How far Pope John can go is an interesting question. He made some remarkable appointments and non appointments in the past few days which auger well in my opinion. There have been many interesting incidents that give an insight into this Pope’s soul. One the most interesting was that he personally contacted a an unwed woman carrying the child of her married lover (he apparently had concealed his marriage.) One of the woman’s concerns was that since she wasn’t married, her child would not be baptized. Pope Francis comforted the woman by by promising to baptize the child himself. The other day out of curiosity I checked the church bulletin at my local parish. Sure enough, when it talked about ground rules for baptizing an infant it required a review of the parent(s)’ and God Parent(s) appropriateness. The there is the issue of communion which some prelate’s in the US have been threatening to deny to recalcitrant politicians who did not toe the Church’s mark on a number of issues including gay marriage, contraception and abortion. Francis has said words to the effect that we need communion to nourish us because we are all sinners. Hos recent appointments give us solid indication about his attitude towards the right wing ideologues who have recently controlled the US Catholic Bishop’s Conference.

Louis has made tremendous contributions to the Shroud scholarship but I respectfully differ with him on somethings. My perspective of what a Christian is may differ from his. I think mine may be closer to that of Pope Francis. Some years ago, I pondered a solution to the multiple religions quandary that actually echoed something Bobby Kennedy suggested to his brother and his other advisers dealing with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Khrushchev (like Kennedy) was dealing with a bellicose faction in the military and he sent two messages in near rapid succession. One was quite temperate and promising. The second was bellicose and threatening seeming to shut the door, Bobby’s proposal was to ignore the second message and respond to the first. (There were numerous other factors including a not widely publicized intervention by Pope John XXIII) It worked. What I think the Pope should do, and I think what Pope Francis has effectively been doing is recognize that all those parts of humanity whatever their formal religion are de facto Christians and a part of his flock. His obligation is to all of humanity, not just baptized Catholics. When I was a child (and even a teenager) I was taught that the hallmarks of the true church was that it be One, Holy, Catholic [universal] and Apostolic. By asserting the moral authority of the Christian Gospel and finding common cause with multiple religious leaders Francis is creating a framework for a truly Catholic Church. His essential message becomes you are all Catholics and I am the pope of all. Kind of like the Kennedy’s ignoring the bombast of the second message and concentrating on the first. When we surrender to love, we belong to a universal church whether we want to admit it or not. All of the scriptures and the prophets resolve to this: love. Don’t argue with me, that is what He said.

Although I don’t intend to do much with the concept right now, Hugh’s initial skepticism that I could construct (with tutelage) a tesseract at age 17 drew my attention to the tesseract: a three dimension representation of a four dimensional cube, the fourth dimension being time. You have in the tomb Christ’s body one instant and in another instant it’s gone. That instant is to people of faith, the Resurrection.

The piece was written in 1971 1972 before the environmental community began to focus on “climate change”. Oil was a big source of pollution then as it is today. Alas, pollution seems to be small potatoes compared to climate change. How does climate change connect to the Shroud? I give you the introduction to Chapter 17. The Apocalypse of Selfishness: The Great “So What?” “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather for the sky is red.’ And in the morning, ‘There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and lowering.’ You know then how to discern the face of the sky, and can you not know the signs of the times?” Matthew 16:2 4 It is my premise that the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus, called Christ, and that it offers evidence that supports the claim of his resurrection within three days of his crucifixion. The scientific examination of the Shroud began with the Secondo Pia photographs in 1898. Until then, the facts concerning the death and purported Resurrection were essentially matters of faith drawing on the four Gospels accounts, the Epistles of Christ’s apostles and oral traditions of cloudy provenance. There were even those who claimed that Christ never existed at all. Science has now provided a rock of fact to which believers may cling. But so what? Here’s what: Humanity now faces an apocalyptical extinction as a species. Revelations and other apocalyptical writings have been until now mystical allegories and metaphors. But science is not prophesying in metaphors or allegories – its prophecies of doom are based on hard facts. The Apocalypse that threatens us is an apocalypse of selfishness. The heedless exploitation of our environment has resulted in multiple crises that demand immediate, concerted international cooperation and action, but the very apostles of selfishness that are driving humanity to the brink of extinction bar our way. For prophecy of an apocalypse, let us turn to the current Roman Catholic Pope. “Small yet strong in the love of God, like Saint Francis of Assisi, all of us, as Christians, are called to watch over and protect the fragile world in which we live, and all its peoples. Pope Francis ¶216 Evangelii Gaudium Despite some criticisms from conservative elements in the Church, Francis has not retreated from his elevation of the environment to a religious issue.

Try klotzlaw@gmail.com As for your comment, I guess I am a “Chardinist” or “Teilhardist” (whichever) when it comes to science and religion. The fact that many scientist adopt “an argument from incredulity” as to Christ and the Resurrection,doesn’t change the fact that science itself is a search for truth and has made amazing progress in unraveling the mysteries of existence. It is now knocking on the door of the mystery of consciousness. It can’t be ignored or pigeon holed. That is why I find the work of Hameroff so interesting. Again, I recommend a brief video of him: For primitive man, anything inexplicable ended up as part of his religion. Thus the volcano was a god, the stars and planets were gods and everything that happened inexplicably was a visitation from god. As human knowledge expanded, the province of the gods shrunk. Now science is knocking on the door of ultimate issues. Some theologians and some science seek to avoid what Teilhard knew was an eventual merger of science into religion. You can’t avoid the science that is exploring the seminal issues of existence. The first physicist to propound a theory of the “Big Bang” creation of the universe was a Belgian priest scholar. He did it my simply taking the calculations that demonstrated an expanding, rather than a static universe and reverse them to an ultimate point where the Universe emerges with a “Big Bang” from nothingness, or what I prefer to call cosmic chaos. (That word may a have a scientific definition of a state other than the one I prefer.) But just as Galileo’s telescope first revealed the magnificent beauty and order of creation, science as to grapples withe the quantum and what lies beyond, is creating a “te deum” of its own. Of course many scientists are agnostic and atheistic, that’s their problem. In some recess of their minds they are apostles of Nietzsche who propounded that “God is Dead.” Spoiler alert: That’s where I am heading with this chapter, the Apocalypse of Selfishness. We have institutionalized selfishness and besides Nietzsche, among the apostles of the Antichrist are Ayn Rand and the Austrian School of Economics. Those apostles are the subject Pope Francis withering disdain. That’s some agenda I have set for myself, I have already accumulated well over 100 items in my Apocalypse research folder (digitized). I believe in what I am doing and I think the pay off is worth the candle, it is however, proving to be a tough nut to crack. Thank you. Your comments and references are always welcomed.

I do not recall whether I had even heard of Nietzsche at that point but may have seen some tangential references that had registered very much. The Professor read “The Madman” to us and it was quite a moment. When the mad men told the people that God is dead but he has died beyond the space and news of his death hadn’t reached us yet, I was quite taken. Not by his philosophy but his insight. Nietzsche was primarily a late 19th century writer but I felt that the news of God’s death arrived with a bang in WWI and the reverberations of that echo still. However, philosophically, Nietzsche’s philosophy of the superman beyond morality never became a part of my thinking. Strauss wrote a piece inspired by Nietzsche entitled “Thus Spake Zarathusta (auf Englshe). It’s opening bars were the introduction in the Kubrick and Arthur Clarke’s “2001, a Space Odyssey.” It was clearly informed by Nietzsche’s superman credo. At the end, as the world is destroyed by nuclear one only one man, the surviving astronaut who has morphed into an eternal entity has survived. Like probably most movie goers, I never caught the Nietzsche reference at the time. It is supreme irony, that 2001 came and there was one transcendent moment: the terrorist attack of 9/11.

That is not just a religious or scientific question, it is also a political one. In the last chapter of my book Quantum Christ I quote Andrew Revkin of the N.Y. Times who at the 2014 Vatican conference on the environment was chose to sum up the proceedings: “The physical and biological sciences, along with revolutionary advances in technology – from satellites to supercomputers – have provided a clarifying picture of human driven environmental changes. Psychological and sociological studies have revealed deeply ingrained human traits; many shaped by our evolutionary history as a “here and now” species, that prevent us from acting rationally in the face of threats with long time scales, dispersed impacts and inherent complexity. Possible paths have been delineated in recent decades using ever more sophisticated models. But that is where science’s task ends. It is up to individuals and societies to choose which paths to pursue.”.","date":"2014-11-17","mins":"7:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/17/quote-for-today-historical-criteria-do-not-fall-from-the-sky/","cat":"article","title":"Quote for Today:  Historical criteria do not fall from the sky"},{"id":"comment-197035","author":"john_klotz","post":"Dan, This an exceptionally important post.

It may seem an odd topic for some but a posting today on the Shroudstory blog brings it in to stark relevance particularly with the atrocities being committed by the fanatics of ISIL (As evil as their persecution of Christians have been, it is maybe that they have slaughtered more Moslems that Christians). The story is this: a group of Moslems visited the current exposition of the Shroud in Turin as a gesture of unity of all humanity. See https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/the imams who came to see the shroud/ And if you are interested in what my book is about: http://johnklotz.blogspot.com There reviews and comments on that posting. In Chapter two of the book, quote Elaine Pagels writing in her book the Gnsotic Gospels: https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/the imams who came to see the shroud/ (It was a part of my Christmas posting on my blog.) Orthodox Christianity teaches that the tree of faith was enriched by the blood of the martyrs. Elaine Pagels, hardly a Vatican favorite, concluded that the example set by the Christian martyrs was in fact a key to orthodox Christianity’s ascendancy over its gnostic competitors. “No doubt the persecutions terrified many into avoiding contact with Christians, but Justin and Tertullian both say that the sight of martyrs aroused the wonder and admiration that impelled them to investigate the movement, and then to join it. And both attest that this happened to many others. (As Justin remarked: “The more such things happen, the more do others, in larger numbers, become believers.”) Tertullian writes in defiance to Scapula, the proconsul of Carthage: ‘Your cruelty is our glory … All who witness the noble patience of [the martyrs], are struck with misgivings, are inflamed with desire to examine the situation … and as soon as they come to know the truth, they immediately enroll themselves as its disciples.’[i]” Pagels then puts martyrdom in the context of Christ’s life in words that echo Pasternak: “In its portrait of Christ’s life and his passion, orthodox teaching offered a means of interpreting fundamental elements of human experience. Rejecting the gnostic view that Jesus was a spiritual being, the orthodox insisted that he, like the rest of humanity, was born, lived in a family, became hungry and tired, ate and drank wine, suffered and died. They even went so far as to insist that he rose bodily from the dead. Here again, as we have seen, orthodox tradition implicitly affirms bodily experience as the central fact of human life. What one does physically—one eats and drinks, engages in sexual life or avoids it, saves one’s life or gives it up—all are vital elements in one’s religious development. But those gnostics who regarded the essential part of every person as the “inner spirit” dismissed such physical experience, pleasurable or painful, as a distraction from spiritual reality—indeed, as an illusion. No wonder, then, that far more people identified with the orthodox portrait than with the “bodiless spirit” of gnostic tradition. Not only the martyrs, but all Christians who have suffered for 2,000 years, who have feared and faced death, have found their experience validated in the story of the human Jesus.”[ii] ..","date":"2015-04-21","mins":"7:14 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/21/the-imams-who-came-to-see-the-shroud/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"The Imams Who Came to See the Shroud"},{"id":"comment-120735","author":"john_klotz","post":"The point here is not that the author is a bat*** reactionary, Ann Randian freak.

Barrie can speak for himself but the facts, as he reported in the BSTS Journal and other places are that as a Jew (whether observant or not) he was reluctant to get involved with a “Christian” relic. One colleague, who was also Jewish (Don Devan) convinced him that because they were Jewish and had no one would expect them to have a bias toward authenticity. “So at Don’s [Devan’s] suggestion, I became a member of the STURP team, but I didn’t feel very comfortable about it. In fact, a few months into the project, I remember jokingly saying to Don Lynn at one of our many meetings, ‘”What’s a nice Jewish boy like me doing on a Christian Project like this?’ “Don smiled and answered that perhaps I had forgotten that ‘the Man in question was also a Jew.’ “’No, I knew that,’ I stated. So then Don gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever been given. He said, ‘God doesn’t tell us in advance what the plan is. Go to Turin and do the best job you can. Someday, you’ll know why.’ His words kept me on the team at that time when I was seriously considering quitting. And to make a long story short, he certainly was right!” Barrie’s lingering doubt was the issue of the blood evidence and its bright color. An explanation offered in a discussion with Al Adler in the 1990’s finally resolved that issue. In 1995, a friend called him told that the friend and his wife had seen a headline in a sensationalist magazine sold at supermarket checkout counters that revealed that the Shroud was “a photograph” created by Leonardo Da Vinci.” Schwortz decided that the resources, including his own photographs of the 1978 STURP examination which he had shared with numerous authors, needed a wider audience. He made a note in a file folder sitting on his desk: “Consider building a website.” A short time later he had a conversation with Don Lynn and reminded him of the advice he had received: : “Years ago, when you told me that someday I would know why I was on the Shroud team, well, you were right. I’ve finally figured it out and it only took eighteen years!” There are a lot of things the press has gotten wrong about the Shroud at various times. Don’t be too hard on a reporter for a little hyperbole because the essence of what he was reporting is true: Barrie approached the Shroud as a skeptic and had lingering doubts of authenticity for many years after. He was also a skeptic of the carbon dating because on thing h did know from the STURP examination: the Shroud was not a painting. I certainly hope the pseudo skeptics who sometimes populate this blog don’t use your post as an excuse to launch any attack on Barrie or the press.

On the other hand when you add up all the other facts, the only logical conclusion is that the Shroud is authentic. There is no other person from the first century CE that has been identified that suffered and died like Christ. The Shroud and the common facts among the four Gospel accounts of the Crucifixion complement and reinforce each other. I won’t bother to refute Mc Cone, Shroud.com and shroudstory.com contain ample rebuttal. To evaluate Mc Cone with Rogers is preposterous and it is the kind of logic the underlies some of the insanity of our times.

There are times when we have to choose and any one who is intellectually honestly open to the facts will I believe choose Rogers. The real mystery about the Shroud is how the imagine was created. Clearly not by human hand but by some yet unidentified process. There are theories but none thus far have proved out. I believe that what we have seen in the Shroud thus far offers support for the Resurrection but not yet proof.

Whoever insists upon these shrouds’ authenticity cannot be adhering to rigorous intellectual discipline.” Prof. Bollone, appearing on an Italian state television broadcast called Mixer, replied: “These days no serious scholar — and a review of the specialized literature proves this — believes in the ‘late medieval’ thesis suggested by the 1988 radiocarbon analysis.” The professor went on to insist: “The Shroud is mentioned in documents composed before the date established by C 14. Furthermore, we now are in possession of intrinsic data from coin imprints, dating the cloth to around 30 AD.” What bothers me is that this Dominican monk is a member of the ” Pontifical Academy of Science.” I think we need a new Father Rinaldi to plead the Shroud’s case..","date":"2012-12-17","mins":"11:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/12/17/is-it-absurd-to-think-that-the-shroud-can-show-a-physical-trace-of-the-resurrection/","cat":"books","title":"Is it absurd to think that the Shroud can show a physical trace of the Resurrection?"},{"id":"comment-140593","author":"john_klotz","post":"Charles, Thank you for your courtesy in replying.

I had not limited my inquiry to representations of Christ. This image is unique, It’s existence is quite fragile because of the fact that it is among other things it is simply a discoloration of a either the outer cell wall of a fibrile or according to Rogers may be the discoloration not of the linen fibriles but of a containment left over from the retting process. Rogers had an advantage because he had access to actual fibers from the linen. He was a chemist with impeccable credentials. Ultimately in his book he conceded he did not have the answer as to the actual formation process. I have a sincere hope that advances in mutilspectral digital analysis may provide some more definitive answers as to the nature of image and its relationship to the Shroud, The Vatican will have to get off the dime on this. That’s a challenge Pope Francis faces. I will also venture into Charles area of expertise with an amateurish proposition: If there is a convention it must have started somewhere. There had to be an original object that caught artist’ attention had then was adopted by them. The Shroud was, as far as we know, not created by an artist. Yet, there were clearly paintings of a images on large pieces of cloth that appeared in Medieval times which mimic the Shroud. Without getting into a debate about this because I must get Chapter 18 written,and the manuscript concluded there are more than three authors who have written extensively about the uniqueness of the Shroud image: Paul Vignon, Ian Wilson and Thomas de Wesselow. The various representations of the Shroud which incorporate unique aspects of the image of the Shroud were clearly paintings and drawings. Many of them disappeared in the bonfires of the French Revolution. The Shroud didn’t and the fact it didn’t is a first blush a stroke of good luck. I am not a fan of those who believe that everything in life is “God’s will” or divine providence. I remember from my High School religious instruction the following: If you build a house on a flood plain and a flood comes and sweeps it away, that’s not divine providence, it’s human stupidity. Humanity has in effect built its house on a flood plain and the flood is coming. It’s climate change and we are threatened literally with extinction. That extinction if it comes will be the result of millions of selfish decisions made in the course of the Industrial Revolution. It is a “tragedy of the commons.” The proposition to mull over is the same as I learned more than 50 years ago: the Sixth Extinction is not divine providence it’s human selfishness. The survival of the Shroud to this time and place and the reintroduction of Christ into the discourse through the science of the Shroud may not be blind luck but Divine Providence. Without the advances the Science, the Shroud would be what Calvin and others claimed it to be: an evil superstition promulgated by an evil Vatican.

The ancient Greek mechanism, you describe is essentially a mechanical computer appears to be similar to what is still in existence from 1452 – the Bourges Cathedral astronomical clock. No one has yet to produce an image and you can not identify an image with the properties of the Shroud. Alger Hiss was convicted if perjury for denying that he had given secret documents to Whitaker Chambers a confessed Communist spy who eventually rejected Marxism. One of the pieces of evidence against Hiss is that exert testimony disclosed that documents had been retyped on a typewriter in Hiss’s possession. After conviction, Martin Tytell was hired on the appeal and he produced (after two years) a typewriter that could duplicate the same identifying typographical aspects that were supposedly unique to the Hiss typewriter. The conviction was not set aside. Just because you can forge or copy something, doesn’t ,mean that the object in question was forged. There are cases where art forgers have produced paintings so true to an original master style, that art experts have vouched for their authenticity in court under oath and been eventually proven wrong. To say that ancient Greeks devised an analog computer found in pieces and then reconstructed, proves absolutely nothing about the issue of the originality of image in a totally inexplicable medium. To say you are grasping at straws would be an understatement. Pseudo skeptics who for deep personal reasons can not cope with the authenticity of the Shroud display their anxiety when they come up with supercilious reasoning. You are better than that.

How’s that for gibberish jargon except its not. Science is intruding on religion and millennia of philosophical musings and constructs are headed for the dust bin of history. Please don’t bother me or the rest of civilization with Cartesian constructs. They no ,longer apply. What I have essentially read so far are philosophical objections and not scientific ones. Teilhard foresaw a convergence of science and religion..I don’t see evidence of that in the comments. A classmate of mine from high school, last year (who is a retired but active emeritus professor with a Ph D in Physics from Carnegie – Mellon) directed me to a video of Stuart Hameroff discussing the operation of the brain in term of quantum “action at a distance” or entanglement. When quantum entanglement first appeared, Einstein, arguably the greatest mind of the twentieth century, called in “spooky” and at first rejected it. Quantum mechanics is to the mind captured in a Newtonian net is weird. But it’s not a philosophy, it’s science..The existence of the Shroud is not a philosophical construct, it’s as physical reality as real as Pike’s Peak. Science has told us how Pike’s Peak came to be. There is an enduring mystery of how the Shroud image came to be. Science is not ready to solve that mystery yet. It will probably not be solved in my lifetime. But you younger guys and gals write this down. This is my prophecy: when the problem of the image formation is solved, Science will be staring the Resurrection (note the capital “R”) in the face. David R. I’ll make a challenge to you. Forget your personally designed IQ test. Find an impartial authority and we compete in an IQ test. When I was 11 years old I had an extraordinary result in an individual test at Syracuse U. When a professor called my mother to explain the results he didn’t give the real number. When my mother said my oldest brother (five boys in the family) had an IQ of 130, he replied, “Oh he (moi) is much higher than that. In my mid forties, enduring a typical crisis of confidence, I took the Mensa test. I passed. That meant at least the 98%. There is no such thing as the 100 percentile. 98% is a genius level, is it not? If not it’s still pretty good for an old man of 40. (When I took it) I really hate to go there because if I’m so smart, why ain’t I rich? Some years ago, I ran in a Democratic primary for District Attorney of the Bronx. Initially, I am informed I had the highest Q rating. Of the five contestants. That measures public favorabilty of name recognition, essentially. However, that faded. It would have taken a half a million dollars (which two opponents had) and my funds never hit more than mid five figures A very well known influential politician who should of supported me didn’t. When he was asked by one of his contributors to do so, he snapped: “John Klotz only does what John Klotz wants to do.” When it was reported back to me, the hackles on my neck rose temporarily, but any anger subsided. “Put it on my tombstone,” I thought “He only did what he wanted to do.” That particularly politician brushed me off publicly as a “courageous gadfly.”: He meant it as a put down. I thought of Plato:(Socrates?) “I am that gadfly which God has attached to the state, and all day long …arousing and persuading and reproaching…You will not easily find another like me.” Incidentally, we are now on good terms. It’s like nothing ever happened. My next Chapter after I finish this one will be “Apocalypse Now.” It’s theme will be that anti Christ selfishness is on the verge of destroying humanity. That, by the way is a purely scientific argument. I do have a metaphorical anti Christ in mind. It’s called the Austrian School of Economics. It is the the system which led to the Michael Douglas quote in Wall Street,, “Greed is Good.” It’s not.. Don’t trust me, read the Gospel of Matthew. Or maybe the National Geographic or yesterday’s New York Times about Bangladesh..( I mean Sunday, March 30th.) I appreciate constructive comments. Try my blog. Of course, it’s monitored. I once had someone stalking me on the web. He included comments like my relatives all burning in Hell. Or my oldest brother being a racist because I quoted one of his comments about JFK in WWII not being a hero. “The only thing he ever did is get his PT boat run over by a J*p destroyer.” By the way, JFK was a hero of mine.

Nothing could be more “spiritual” than out of body experiences (OBE) or near death experiences (NDE). Yet Hameroff has postulated a “physical” quantum explanation that would also apply to immorality. That doesn’t mean there is no immortality or OBE or NDE. It means that these phenomena can be explained scientifically. And that doesn’t make us all atheists either. It gives fresh meaning to the old hymn: How Great thou Art. I find that exciting. As I point out in material which I do not think I have posted and will not if I haven’t because it’s a crucial part of the manuscript, Teilhard’s construction of the inner and outer aspects of existent objects has it’s root in scholastic philosophy which had echoes of Plato. But it is not philosophy, it is,, as Teilhard, insisted, science. All of these philosophical distinctions that allow philosophers to mask the hard facts of reality are melting away in the face of quantum phenomena. The quantum is a mystery, but if you don’t know quantum is a physical phenomenon – even if it is subject to consciousness – you don’t know jack.

In 1902, more than three decades before he published his “Vignon Markings” he compared medieval depictions of Christ and found them inferior to the Shroud image and quite different. I was originally attracted to Christ to Coke because its author Martin Kemp was the leading art historian backing the Da Vinci origination of what he dubbed “La Principessa” an art scandal par excellence when Christie evaluated a 100 million dollar drawing for $17,000 and sold it on consignment.

He cites Pantocrator as the ultimate Christ icon and ignores or does not know about the well publicized Vignon markings linking to the Shroud image to the Pantocrator. He is dismissive of Ian Wilson’s “Mandylion theory,” and list Wilson’s latest book as “Reading” as well as the entire Shroud.com cite.(Kindle Edition location 1005). He ignores the Vignon markings even though they are discussed in the book he lists as “Reading.” (Kemp, Martin [2011 10 13]. Christ to Coke : How Image Becomes Icon, Figure 26, Kindle Edition location 2680) And he sort of grouses about the carbon dating controversy and then swallows it whole hog. His attribution of it to the Medieval/Renaisance times as a painting by an unknown Italian or French artists is – GIVEN THE EVIDENCE – absurd. “If I were asked to provide an art historical date for the portrayal of Christ on the Shroud, I would estimate it have been made in the later thirteenth or first half of the fourteenth century in Italy or southern France. This is consistent with the much denigrated carbon dating.” (Kemp: Kindle Locations 954 956). It is not a painting. If anything, what Barrie Schwortz has estimated to be more than a quarter of a million hours of Shroud research has demonstrated that. However, I have a working theory or an opinion about Mr. Kemp’s astute blindness. One of the bases of his La Principessa opinion is carbon dating that was done on its vellum which dated it to Da Vinci’s time. Is it possible that Oxford Don Kemp used Oxford’s very own carbon dating lab to do the dating? If so, is his attack on the Shroud authenticity occasioned by a necessity to, at least indirectly, defend the Oxford carbon dating lab? Perhaps the good Professor could enlighten us on who did his carbon dating? Just asking. Were we in court and he was testifying as an expert on the Shroud, it would be an admissible question on cross examination. It’s called bias. ..","date":"2012-03-16","mins":"8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/01/18/new-book-christ-to-coke/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: Christ to Coke"},{"id":"comment-10854","author":"john_klotz","post":"Not on my “buy now” list..","date":"2012-04-26","mins":"7:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/04/26/new-book-stone-and-dung-oil-and-spit/","cat":"books","title":"New Book: Stone and Dung, Oil and Spit"},{"id":"comment-89545","author":"john_klotz","post":"Secrets have been threatening to destroy the Vatican for centuries if not a millenia and a half.

I guess the problem is the literal translation of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments. I wonder if either of the writers read Genesis literally. Pope Benedict certainly doesn’t. It’s not history, it is metaphor or allegory but we have much to learn from Genesis. Four thousand years ago religion explained everything from the blowing of the wind to the flicker of the fire. The first scientists were the ancient priests. Science and religion sprang form the same soil. We have earned many things in the ensuing millennia and many things that were religion are now science. Now science is nibbling at what would seem to be purely religious questions: most importantly the nature of consciousness and the soul. If you believe in God as creator, then He must have left fingerprints. Certainly the Shroud is such a fingerprint. But the quantum level of existence is something more: it is an interface and its seeming irrationality I believe is evidence that at the quantum level we are just one step removed from that consciousness from which all existence has proceeded and to which all shall return. Ultimately all of the law and all of the prophets resolve to one word and concept: love. What is exciting to me is how at the quantum level some see love not as an abstraction but a reality. When Galileo demonstrated the folly of Ptolemy, he was nearly burned at the stake and had to recant the truth. It was Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in the Phenomenon of Man who wrote of a synthesis of Science and Religion, something the militant atheists like Dawkins would ultimately reject. But in the scientific study of the Shroud that is what we are doing. If that study demonstrates support for the Resurrection, is that bad? If you truly believe in Christ, do not fear science. I believe that in this skeptical age the Shroud is a “game changer.” Is it perhaps Divine Providence that just when science is knocking on the door of the ultimate issues of existence, science is also proving the reality and vitality of Christ: crucified and Resurrected?.","date":"2011-12-31","mins":"8:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/12/29/the-coming-of-the-quantum-christ/","cat":"books","title":"The Coming of the Quantum Christ"},{"id":"comment-6472","author":"john_klotz","post":"Thanks for your comments.

Although I think Occam’s Razor is much over used, I have suddenly found my self resorting to it. There ares several permutations of it. Basically I beleive the most sophisticated form is that the solution that requires to the fewest assumptions is more likely the correct one. But it is rephrased. In the military there developed the KISS principle which has two variation depending if you use a comma. It can be “Keep it simple, stupid.” (with a comma) which calls the addressee stupid. Or it can be without a comma: “Keep it simple stupid” which means that the ultimate in simplicity should be “simple stupid.” [understandable by even stupid people]. I have found the work of Daryl Domning very intriguing. There is an article of his available on the web site of the Jesuit web site of the Jesuit web site America: See Evolution, Evil and Original Sin” America, Vol. 185 No. 15 (November 12, 2001) He also wrote a book with colleague, the late Monka K. Helwig:., “Original Selfishness: Original Sin and Evil in the Light of Evolution” (Ashgate, 2006); The issue is whether selfishness was one of the driving forces of evolution. Start there. It’s a simple, but not too simple, proposition. Now I appreciate there are theologians who do not like simple propositions and wander off into complex constructs that have little relationship to how we actually live our lives. I believe that in the Great Commandment(s) and the Last Judgment, Christ made it very simple. In fact he kind of applies Occam’s Razor when he explains the dual commands to love God and Love neighbor and then he says “On these two commandments depend the the whole law and the prophets.” I note that some modern translations have changed the last line. But I like my Confraternity Edition which cost me $1 as a Freshman at CBA Syracuse in September, 1950. That’s very simplistic of Christ isn’t. It? Even more simplistic is the “parable” of the Last Judgment where FOUR TIMES we are told the litany of what we must do to prove our love of God. It is, in the end, it is what we do for “these the least of my brethren.” In my view, both the Great Commandments and the Last Judgment are about the mandate to be selfless and not selfish. In sum, because it’s getting late and I have work to do, I submit the following ridiculously simple equations. Selfishness = Evil Selflessness = Love.

The definition of the Shroud photographs available this far do not allow for a definitive determination of the identity of the “coins” if such they be. A discussion of whose face is on the coins at the time of the Crucifixion seems to me to be irrelevant unless there is unequivocal evidence of the identity of the coins. Your critique of Barrie is misplaced and I doubt with all your experience you are as expert in photography as Barrie, he has a masters degree from the Brooks Institute which was the number photography school this side of the pond. He also photographed the Shroud. The problem with so much of the secondary evidence is that it opens vigorous debates that about evidence that can be ambiguous. The other side of the coin is that all the subsidiary circumstances do point towards the authenticity of the Shroud. As far as the Quantum is concerned, existence at the Quantum level is in fact a mystery that physics has yet to unravel and increasingly the evidence for conscious intervention at the quantum level is increasing, not decreasing. If an individual accepts the Resurrection “on faith” he/she shouldn’t be upset if advances in physics at the quantum lever begin to explain things formerly thought otherwise inexplicable. For example Stuart Hameroff has advanced quantum theories that explain a several phenonema that have been described but derided by skeptics for centuries including Near Death Experiences and point the way to the reality of eternal life. As intriguing as Hameroff’s theories are they remain theories but point the way to further avenues of research..","date":"2015-06-19","mins":"8:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/06/19/paper-chase-offensive-coins-heads-or-tails/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Paper Chase:  Offensive Coins?

The piece of linen called the Shroud of Turin either covered the body of Christ at one time, or it did not. If it did not, there may be all kinds of beautiful things to say about the Shroud, but they arejust beautiful words, but not facts. I don’t mean to be obtuse, but if the Shroud is not the factual, authentic Shroud of Christ. Than any other observations is just words. I believe that it is authentic by applying the standards of proof we use every day of our lives, not just in court. Perhaps also, we might apply e words of Christ rebuking the deliberate obtuseness of the Pharisees and priests: “When you see a cloud rise in the west, straight away, you say, ‘There is a shower coming’ and so it is that a shower comes. And when you see the westwind blow, you say ‘There will be heat’ and then that happens. You hypocrites, you can understand the face of the sky and the earth, but how is it that you can not understand the signs of the times?” Luke 12:54 56 The Shroud of Turin is a sign of OUR times brought to us not by scripture but by science. It’s authenticity can only be rebutted by facts, not theological musings. The carbon dating by the labs is both scientifically and factually challenged, but that is a whole another debate.

No one has made a convincing case for any process that does not ultimately point to the Resurrection. That certainly, on that issue, puts me closer to Jackson than Rogers. However, Jackson’s theory which was expressed in the film as to carbon dating didn’t pan out. Unless, I am mistaken (and I think I am not) the clip was from an film several years old. . Unfortunately, Rogers published a critique of Jackson on image formation in the last century that as we would say in my old neighborhood, “Got Jackson’s dutch up.” As a result, Jackson appears determined to claw at Rogers, and not altogether fairly. His hypothesis on atmospheric carbon didn’t pan out and now, as I understand it, he hypothesizes some reaction caused by the Resurrection. As to the issue of the carbon dating we don’t have to go there. As to the issue of image formation I believe that ultimately we have to. But the issue of carbon dating of a much abused corner of the Shroud is distinct from the issue of image formation. Rogers work on carbon dating was peer reviewed and in the last two years of his life he sought opinions from colleagues and asked them to check his work. At least one of those he asked to review was John Brown of Georgia Tech was a giant in his field. He had a scanning microscope in his dinning room. And I am having a “duh” moment on the issue of image formation. Scattered here and there are references to concern that Shroud has to be protected from ambient light because it can accelerate the aging process that is darkening the whole cloth and may eventually swallow the image. Once upon a time the Shroud was a pure white linen cloth. Now it is not. When the Mona Lisa was subjected to a multispectral digital imaging process, Lumiere Technology had to develop a unique source of light that did not damage the painting. They did so. But the problem of light and the Shroud is not dissimilar. Now what caused this image? Could it be light from a unique source?

Rogers analysis included threads from the material held back FROM THE CARBON AREA that were retained by Luigi Gonella. His science in that regard was completely peer reviewed. He asked other scientists to double check his work. They did and they concurred. That’s one issue. His ideas on image formation were incomplete as even he realized. Rogers work on the carbon test area was completely transparent. The fact is that he had a hypothesis that even he realized was incomplete when it came to the image formation problem. It is not logical to combine the critique of his incomplete image formation hypothesis with criticism of his documented and work on the threads from the carbon test area. It’s really depressing that people who have an argument with his image hypothesis then feel it necessary to blow smoke about his work on the carbon test site threads. It’s apple and oranges. Logically it is self defeating for one faction to try to discredit another faction on an issue. We should be open to multiple view points. There is no conflict between the proof that the carbon testing area was subject to repairs and that the image formation process implicates the resurrection directly. One, the carbon testing, is directly resolvable by scientific testing of the physical threads. Rogers did that.

Tomorrow, I will dine with an individual who as a Ph D in History from Princeton and a relationship with my family. She has published and hopefully will not perish. I asked her about History Today and it turns out that History Today is not peered reviewed. Given Charles Freeman’s blather about his research and the attention to the History Today article, I ask Charles a question: Was your article in History Today vetted by a formal peer reviewed process? Yes or no. Second, Daveb’s comment is thorough (as usual) and confines not only the D’Arcis memorandum and the Chevalier Thurston screeds to the dust bin of history but repeats a rather obvious speculation (that Ian Wilson proposed) that whatever D’Arcis was told, the artist was talking about a copy of the Shroud. And as we know, from a very early time after the first exposition, artists started to copy the Shroud. The history of the Shroud after the first exposition indicates the distinct possibility that Shroud had been withdrawn from public view and it is quite possible that the cannons of the Lirey Church were displaying a copy of the Shroud which was after all their bread and butter. But I may hypothesize the wheel. In fact, see the following article by Luigi Fossati published in Shroud Spectrum in 1983: http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/ssi08part5.pdf The point is, as Daveb (and earlier Wilson and then Fossati) points out, the Chevalier Thurston hypothesis was itself a hoax. The video posting of the film narrated by Sr. Damien like the STURP report before it and every other peer reviewed publication that I am aware of, annihilates any painting thesis and actually ties together some loose ends. For example why did Nicodemus produce such a large amount of material for the entombment? It wasn’t all meant for the body but to also coat the tomb in a manner that was common to tombs at the time. Watch the video as the mystery is unraveled. (And the Gospel account of Nicodemus’s action substantiated). Also, The Ray Rogers hypothesis on the image formation process is generally supported.

It isn’t. The Should is not an academic construct. It is a real object existing here and now. Let me state here and now. If the Shroud is authentic, with the possible exception of nuclear weapons, it is the most important object on the face of the earth. Do you have another nominee? An authentic Shroud confirms the reality of Jesus Christ, his horrible torture and his crucifixion. It also offers circumstantial evidence that support the account of his Resurrection as told in the Gospels. Those are matters of more than “academic interest.” I don’t know what that phrase means on your side of the Pond, but on this side it is more or less synonymous with “hypothetical” or “theoretical.” This is why I think Jesus Christ and his Shroud are of more than hypothetical importance. We are facing the threat of an apocalypse that I have dubbed the “The Apocalypse of Selfishness.” It is the selfishness exploitation of the environment that causes many scientists to project the effective extinction of humanity within 100 years. Jesus Christ is the example of selfish love martyred by the disciples of selfishness. Let me give you a freebie. The last four paragraphs of my book; “The power of the selfish conduct which drove humanity forward through evolution is now driving humanity to extinction. It is in our power to resist that, but our resistance must be through acts of selfless love both collectively and individually. “Humanity may survive another 100 years or perhaps another 100 million. Because of the triumph of selfishness, it may end when the world becomes a poisonous, toxic rock unsuitable for any habitation. Or, humanity could be extinguished when a massive meteorite or asteroid plummets to earth starting a chain of events that will render human life untenable. Whether we, collectively or individually, find our lives overwhelmed by selfish power, we can survive no matter how beleaguered we may feel or become, remembering always that God is love. “Every human being is gifted with that reflective consciousness that removes us from the mundane and opens the path to the eternal consciousness. That will never change. And we have the Shroud that in the words of Fr. Delessi, is “God’s love letter in linen to all mankind.” In this time of peril, let us embrace it. “Joyfully!” If you want to read more.

It seems to be more Mel Gibson than Gospel. Some quick examples. As the the Gibson movie and virtually all medieval art, Christ is shown carrying a complete cross. In reality, crucifixion victims carried “only” the cross bar. But insidious was the presentation of the carbon dating without any explanation of the reason why it has been widely discarded as bad science – the anomalous composition of the place from which the carbon samples were cut. Then it presented without any serious critique the wildly off the track claims of Nicholas Allen that it was a medieval forgery created by a camera obscura. For it to have worked by his process would have required days of exposure in bright sun light. – of a rotting corpse. Yet no evidence of corruption appears on the Shroud. Not to mention the little problem of when was the blood added. Still the program spend precious minutes of air time reenacting medieval forgers working their camera obscura. Also, I believe the Allen “shroud” eventually had its image fade away. Photographically speaking to “fix” the image captured by an emulsion would have required different chemicals. But neither emulsion nor fixers residue appear on the Shroud. Then again we have crown of thorns that was a simple circlet of thorns instead of the cap revealed by the Shroud. More Mel Gibson although his circlet at least had two tiers. This not a complete list. The presentation’s complete ignorance of Benford Marino Rogers and even Giulio Fanti was an tragic omission. I hope to blog on this at some point. Frankly, I have some legal papers to do today and maybe I should cool down.

The distinction was found in the existence of vanillin in the sample but not in the rest of the Shroud. If a fire incident was responsible for excessive heat altering vanillin levels, the existence of significant vanillin in the sample and none in the rest of the Shroud would mean that the sample quite likely was not added to after the 1532 fire. The level of cotton was not a major factor in determing the age of the samples. The relative “youth” of the sample linen was far more important. I can not add anything to the post of O.K. As I am writing this from library but I thank him for his contribution. As far as I know Hugh you have never conducted experiments or eaxaminations of Shroud fibers. Neither have I. But you seem insistent that those who have such as Rogers are somehow incompetent or charlatans. Do you really think you are a better scientist than Rogers? If so, maybe we need more information about your publications and other scientific accomplishments. Since yousdenigrate the work of Rogers, Brown and Villarreal is that such an unreasonable request?Their credentials are a matter of public record. I once determined when I first starting practicing law that an expert was someone with a library card and a point of view, My son Michael later corrected me: an expert is someone with a library card, a point of view and a check.

I note that a description of madder root dye, which Rogers also found, says that it contains three coloured chemicals (alizarin, purpurin and xanthin) and also lignin, gum, sugar, resin, and various other minor chemicals. I wonder if that could be the source of the vanillin?” The lignin is the source if the vanillin. Rogers gave a standardized test for vanillin which he tells us is actually the standard test for for lignin. .Are you playing possum? Asking a questions for which you think you have an answer? It would be nice if you could spare us the suspense and cite some authority for your speculation. If you can’t you are clearly in the area of pseudo skepticism, searching wildly for an explanation for facts you just can’t accept. I really think at this point, barring an explanation with citations to scientific authority as to why an experienced master chemist (which he was) like Rogers would be so ignorant as to not recognize the truth you may be withholding and mistake these seemingly disparate chemicals for vanillin which he has identified. That test was zero for the Shroud and quite high for the C14 and Raes samples. Are you saying the positive result for the test was caused by these chemicals. If you don’t have authority for that proposition, this discussion is over for now. Rogers documented for us in his article and book the steps he took and the tests he used to detect vanillin which is the standard test to identify lignin.

Once more into breach. Bravo Andy, bravo. There is no interwoven cotton on the Shroud in chief. That is the quite positive determination of the STURP team. Whether the interwoven cotton in the C14 sample itself was sufficient to skew the C14 results, the fact is that Rogers identified the linen in C14 as being of medieval or later manufacture. The initial impulse to think the cotton was the principal skewing agent was incorrect. It was the medieval manufacture of the patch with new European linen that was the principal cause. The test for vanillin by Rogers on the fibers from the Shroud in chief was negative – zero. The presence of vanillin in the sample taken from this woebegone corner was positive. They were not the same material. What you have pointed it reinforces the fact that the cotton would not have been in the Shroud when obtained by Joseph of Arimathea. As a devout Jew he would not have purchased a mixed item. As a matter of fact, when it was purchased by Joseph the science supports the conclusion that there was no cotton in the Shroud. Transient cotton contamination was observed. Not interweaving and splicing as occurred on the C14 sample. The interwoven and spliced cotton is an important marker, but the principal proof of age is the vanillin tests. PS: This discussion has really helped me sharpen my view. But it is really time to move on..","date":"2013-10-22","mins":"9:17 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"id":"comment-48370","author":"john_klotz","post":"QED, maybe. I posted to Hugh as I recall, someone can check, that Rogers tests had determined a difference in vanillin between C14 fibers and fibers from the rest of the Shroud. I would be interested in any tests demonstrated contrary results in the non C14 areas from the main portion of the Shroud.. That test was limited to the linen fiber content of both C14 area and non C14 areas. Has anyone replicated those tests or shown them to be in error? I also recall that explanations that the vanillin content being non existent may have been caused by the fire in 1532. That of course would mean that the anomalous C14 area was certainly much younger than than the main body. Now the vanillin content may be a rough indicator compared to other methods of measuring age, but the difference between existence and non existence is pretty absolute. Let me quote Rogers directly: “Sometimes it is simpler to do an experiment. The fire of 1532 did that experiment for us. Any heating at the time of the fire would decrease the amount of vanillin in the lignin as a function of the temperature and time heated. Different amounts of vanillin would have been lost in different areas, depending on the temperature and how long the temperature took to return to normal.. No samples from any location on the Shroud gave the vanillin test. Since the Shroud and other very old linens do not give the vanillin test, I believe that we can be confident that the cloth is quite old. It is very unlikely that the linen was produced during medieval times. See Chapter IX for an explanation of the difference between the radiocarbon age determination and the observations on the linen’s production technology and composition.” (Rogers, p. 43, A Chemist’s Perspective on the Shroud of Turin, Barrie Schwortz, Florrisant, CO., 2008) (Barrie was the editor and publisher of Rogers’ book which is available on Lulu.com) What this may mean is a direct connection between the Margaret of Austria’s will and the patch is not likely. However, that was a theory or speculation. The key is the difference in composition, whatever the cause. The fact is that we do not know, and will probably never know, how many times the Shroud was altered or mended. Enzo Delorenzi, a member of the Turin Commission that studied the Shroud in 1969 and 1973, wrote: “…I should like to mention the impression I received during the course of my examination, namely, that more pairs of hands have carried out the darning than is suggested in the historical records (the four Clarissas of Chambery, the Blessed Valfre and the Princess Clotilde).” Because the only interwoven cotton verified on the Shroud is in the anomalous area of the C 14 testing, what Berry and Freeman have demonstrated is that the anomalous area is in fact of medieval origin. QED Does anyone have any evidence of this cotton interwoven in any other area of the Shroud? Rogers had fibers from non Raes C14 areas of the Shroud and checked those against his findings of he Raes sample. They were different and he did not find interwoven cotton. I think I cam agree with Berry and Freeman: the C14 area contained medieval cotton and linen inter woven. To prove that it is not anomalous, demonstrate were else on the Shroud such interwoven fibers exist? Do they exist throughout the Shroud? Note, there are other patches but only some are documented. Evidence other Mde Fleury Luxemburg’s visual observations is necessary because the contrary evidence is “deep” scientific examinations. Until someone does, I’m moving on although I will cover this in a post to my blog sometime this week if I have a chance to do it right. Let me state, I appreciate these interchanges. I will adjust my thoughts when appropriate. There is great deal of romance to the Margaret of Austria will theory. It appears that it will never be proven. It also appears that while Rogers and his associates proved the anomalous nature of the C14 area, he may have may disproven the will theory..","date":"2013-10-22","mins":"7:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"id":"comment-48552","author":"john_klotz","post":"Dave, Thank you..","date":"2013-10-23","mins":"4:23 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/10/22/comment-promoted-is-cotton-unique-to-the-c14-sample-area/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Comment Promoted:  Is cotton unique to the C14 sample area?"},{"id":"comment-48386","author":"john_klotz","post":"Colin, I think I made myself clear in my last post. There have been detailed scientific examinations of the Shroud particularly in 1978. None of the STURP scientists found interwoven carbon in the parts of the Shroud they were examining. The lower corner that was frequently handled throughout the public expositions of the Shroud through 1933 was not an object on interest because they were concentrating on the image and blood stains, none of which were in that corner. There is an interesting papers by Mark Oxley that covers the water front. Http://www.shroud.com/pdfs/oxley.pdf One thing I learned from the Oxley paper that I had not noticed before is a comment by Rogers that the procedures for cleaning the samples prior to the C14 tests would have removed the evidence of the dye that he found. Rogers samples were not decontaminated and therefore the evidence of the dye was still there. I would appreciate your not arguing this point with me. None of my research is original and I rely on published sources. Read the sources such Oxley’s article and then if you have counter sources or observations state them. But the Shroud is a physical object and there is an enormous amount of published data on its scientific examination. Seat of pants observations or “trust me, I am a physicist,” without citation to that data, just don’t cut it. That certainly applies to art historians who carefully opine with out any detailed reference to the scientific data. As I noted in an earlier post today, the rapture that you have proven that the interwoven cotton was of medieval origin only proves that the patch is newer than the main body of the Shroud which lacks such interwoven cotton. QED I am sorry that my request to Freeman to produce his resources offended you. I think my language while sharp was appropriate. I sure you are aware, given your background, of the old adage: “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” Perhaps my work at sometime will invoke a more public debate beyond this blog.
