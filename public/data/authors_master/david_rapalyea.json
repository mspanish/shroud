{"art":[{"author":"david_rapalyea","post":"I’m Convinced\nI researched The Shroud of Turin up one side and down the other.  Even bought a Pontius Pilate Lepton dated [CE 30] on the antiquities market to see if such a coin could have been used to close the eyes of the man on the shroud as some suggest. IMHO it is WAY to small.\nIn addition, I became aware of an apparently surreptitious C14 test that caused a bit of a stir. The institute in question had their lawyers write up a letter explaining the individual in question was not a C-14 specialist, and the institution never owned the mass spectrometer mentioned.\nSo I researched the institution and the model of the mass spectrometer. I am convinced the C-14 test was done, as the individual confirms, but he will not discuss it. The institution has long standing experience with mass spectrometers, and even donated one from about 1968 to a local museum or some such.\nThe model listed was available on the market at about the time in question, and had at least one update. Lawyer talk. Perhaps. If they didn’t own it, perhaps it was leased. Perhaps the model had received the update and was no longer referred to by its original designation.\nSo when I read Heaven Is Real I decided to see if Kiane’s Jesus resembled the image on the Shroud. \nbingo\n\n","date":"February 27, 2012 at 4:26 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"misc":[{"author":"david_rapalyea","post":"I find all this fascinating.

NOT superimposed. Unless someone actually jiggerred the pixels even I can make out most of the letters.\nIn the you-tube presentation the incription has been moved from a vertical position on the right hand side of the shroud face and superimposed accross the face. In the original position it would be close to foot long and two or three inches wide.\nA: YouTube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndGnEGCJuaA\nB: Large facial representation with all the inscriptions superimposed. http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/big-pic-shroud-turin-claim.html\n3) The coin evidence is a conundrum. The larger full body enhancements clearly show a ‘bug eyed’ look on the right eye [left side of the shroud].\nI used the coin close-up enhancement, copied it to my own software, and bingo. Unless someone has jiggerred the pixels, I can easily see the outline of a coin. More importantly, I can CLEARLY identify the coin as a Pontius Pilate Lepton.\nThe Pontius Pilot Lepton from 30AD [LIZ} or 31AD [LIH] is a distintive coin. It includes a Lituus that looks like a shepherds crook with a surounding inscription TIBEPIOY KAICAPOC. \nMy enlargement clearly shows the outline of a coin and the Lituus sticks out like a sore thumb. It is in the horizontal position with the Lituus starting at the right side of the image, running horizontally then curving up and clockwise and turning in on itself. Just like all the Leptons I have studied that are for sale on the internet.\nBut here it gets interesting. Whanger claims to observe KAICAPOC includes a misspelling where the K is misspelled as a C. My enlargement clearly shows a distinctive C at about the 8:00 position, with the Lituus horizontal.\nHowever, ALL the Leptons I have studied have KAICAPOC starting at near the very top of the Litus and rotating clockwise to near the bottom of the Lituus. Accordingly, I believe Whanger’s ‘C’ is nothing more then a badly executed O or even P in TIBEPIO, given its appearance on the LEFT side of the Lituus.\nNow it gets even stranger. I have identified an actual Lepton where KAICAPOC is CLEARLY spelled with a C at the beginning. But THAT C is located way to the left of the Lepton. If the Lituus is placed horizontally, as in the shroud, the C in CAIPOC is at the 12:00 possition. Not 8:00.\nThis is where I would EXPECT to find the beginning of the word KAICAPOC, whether with C or K.\nSTILL. If the image was not jiggerred, I clearly found a lepton coin on the right eye with a very distinctive Lituus on it.\n\n","date":"April 11, 2010 at 1:51 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/01/20/really-more-evidence-that-verifies-shroud-of-turin-is-real/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Really?
