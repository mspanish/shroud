Of course, since these hypotheses are very complex and hard to reproduce in a lab, we still got no confirmation yet that one of these can really be apply to the Shroud, but nevertheless, in the present state of our knowledge, no one can really discard them, except THOSE WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO USE THE SHROUD TO PHYSICALLY PROVE THE RESURRECTION (i.e. To back up their religiously biased ideology)… Question: What would happen to your faith in the Resurrection if a 100% natural hypothesis for image formation would be proven right in the future??? Personally, I can say that since my faith has grown and is getting a little bit stronger and stronger over the years, my need to rely on the Shroud as some kind of insurance have constantly decrease. I think that if this continue that way (I sure hope so!), then I won’t need the Shroud for my faith no more before the end of my time on Earth. I hope that one day, this relic will only be an helpful tool for me in my meditation about the Passion and death of Christ and nothing else… In sum, the more I advance in my life and in my faith, the more I tend to focus on the Shroud man instead of focusing on his burial cloth. Sure I still love to exchange on that passionate subject, but the more my faith is growing strong, the more the Shroud is becoming secondary. I hope it is the same for all of you! As Christians, we should not “venerate” or focusing too much on Jesus burial Shroud but much more on the God man who came on Earth to show us the real face of love and mercy of the Father! A face of course that we can see on the Shroud (with the eyes of faith).

The law states entropy in a system always goes from order (low entropy) to disorder (higher entropy). If our eyes had the to see in the negative then at the time the shroud was made it would have been a realistic image of a human body either 700 or 2000 years ago.The image would be at least clear or probably clearer than it is now as the entropy of the image would have been lower than now thus the order higher. As time passes and as entropy increases the disorder of the image would increase and the image would become less clear to our negative capable eyes. We need to understand that the shroud actually is a negative image with all information intrinsic in itself (low entropy) at the time of formation(order) of the image. As time passes the image entropy will increase thus disorder increases causing a loss of information and a less clear negative image. Entropy can never decrease over time. Consider racked balls on a pool table; they are at low entropy(ordered) then they are hit by cue ball and scattered entropy increases (disordered) They then will not ever roll back to their racked positions at the end of their motion back to original entropy (ordered state). It is not a matter of probabilities it is impossible. In the case of a painting it is also impossible because looking at a painting with our negative capable eyes we will see a very blurry not realistic human form (high entropy)disorder. Over time as paint flakes off our negative capable eyes will see a human form coming into shape becoming more realistic( entropy decreasing)order increasing.This is a violation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.As a matter of fact the final entropy of the image that our negative capable eyes would see has a lower entropy than the original image our negative capable eyes would see..","date":"2014-11-27","mins":"11:13 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/27/the-makeshift-body-bag-of-turin/","cat":"how_do_we_know","title":"The Makeshift Body Bag of Turin"},{"id":"comment-95481","author":"paul","post":"Modern man can not duplicate the 1 percent (?) negative image that we can see.

There is nothing in any of the documents that the program claims to use which shed light on the 40 days in question. John, along with a college friend produced a obscure movie a few years ago called “Purple State of Mind”, in which John claims you cannot see the real world until you put the Bible down, and stop having your world view seen through it’s pages. In the film, John is shown going to a protestant church in NY, first time ever in his life, for he’s more likely to be found on a Sunday morning at the “church” of Vincent’s BBQ.
