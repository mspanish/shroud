{"art":[{"author":"jodan","post":"I just finished reading “Heaven is for Real.”  Being Catholic I believe there is a wonderful and better life waiting for me, but this book really brought it home.  I was completely mesmerized by Akiane’s painting of the Prince of Peace, even more so after seeing it in color.  A dear friend of mine is near death as I write this, but as sad as it is to think about I know she has a wonderful journey ahead of her.  I await that wonderful journey myself some day.\n\n","date":"February 13, 2012 at 10:28 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
