{"resources":[{"author":"eric_chan_of_hk","post":"Thanks for yr great presentation, Barrie !! It is so true that Jews, according to the Bible, are God’s chosen people and through them the Divine nature is revealed to human beings. We are proud of the message from the Shroud (I believe that it is real !!) since it is an authentication of the Passion of the Christ so that we can get our salvation. It is amazing to find that nearly all descriptions in the 4 Gospels about His passion on the Cross are well contained on the Turin Shroud !!!!  Your fellow Jews had written the Bible, now, you enriched it with the Shroud photos !! Praise the LORD !!  Love your boyhood photo of a young orthodox Jew !!","date":"May 6, 2013 at 5:50 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/03/barrie-schwortz-tedx-via-della-conciliazione-talk/","cat":"science","title":"Barrie Schwortz’ TEDx Via della Conciliazione Talk"}]}
