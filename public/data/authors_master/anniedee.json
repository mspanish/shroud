{"art":[{"author":"anniedee","post":"I enjoyed your blog post very much. I’m cautious about these things too. \nThere’s no way to truly know if the shroud of Turin is real, but it could be – and I hope it is. There are many things that are “almost” and it seems that God is not particularly concerned about providing concrete evidence. \nThey think they’ve found the site where Moses crossed the Red Sea, for example. But it’s been a heck of a time even documenting it much less proving it. (Upcoming Movie website is at: http://www.exodusconspiracy.com/ and the man who told me about it has his web page here: http://pinkoski.com/Articles/Red-Sea-Crossing.html)  \nOr, the continual frustration about almost finding Noah’s Ark but never quite. The only concrete “evidence” we are given is creation itself, the awesome evidence of Nature designed by a Creator. \nIn order to believe in God, we must have Faith. That’s always the bottom line. And for those who do have faith, God confirms it to each one individually so we know we’re not fools… but we can’t prove it. :D \nThank you again for a very nice blog article. Now I want to read the book.\n\n","date":"April 2, 2011 at 11:55 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"},{"author":"anniedee","post":"For those of us who have not had a near-death experience, I always enjoy the “eye-witness” accounts and I do believe they’re absolutely real.
