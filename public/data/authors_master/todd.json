The second difference was his face which was slightly more square in shape but also very strong as belonging to a very strong body.

It is amazing how the discussion can take some pretty sharp turns in different directions. I have read a lot of information pertaining to the Shroud. Both for and against authenticity. One of the things I find most intriguing are the 3D properties of the Shroud. Scientists have confirmed that this piece of linen cloth contains the most advanced image ever seen by man. It is truly a one of a kind. It is the only two dimensional image on earth that can be photographed and turned directly into a 3D image.  This aspect alone is enough to convince me. I do not believe there has ever been anyone in the middle ages, let alone now, that has the ability to create an image with these properties. If so, they would have been the greatest genius to have ever lived. If such a genius did exist, don’t you think that they would have demonstrated their abilities in a different manner? If a genius such as this did exist, don’t you think he would have communicated this ability in some way, to someone? No, I think The Shroud of Turin speaks for itself. If there is someone out there that can find a two dimensional object that can be photographed and the photograph be turned directly into a full 3D image,[ edited]Thanks for the insights","date":"December 6, 2014 at 9:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"},{"author":"todd","post":"Just show that it has the same properties as the Shroud [edited]","date":"December 6, 2014 at 10:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"},{"author":"todd","post":"Great, now all you have to do is present your evidence and research to peer review so that the image can be confirmed to have the 3D holographic properties of the Shroud of Turin.

The theory may indeed be true. Or not. There is evidence to suggest that it is.  Here is a quote from a discussion on this matter.“Chidambaram Ramesh gives us his explanation how this holographic 3D quantum matrix of the body of Jesus Christ could have projected itself onto the surface of the Shroud linen, creating the image of Our Lord Jesus on the Shroud. He gives us also an explanation of some of the very specific characteristics of the Shroud image, the photographic negativity and the built-in body-to-linen 3D information in the grayscale of the image that ought to be explained by anybody who proposes a new image-formation mechanism.                                When you reconstruct a hologram from the master-hologram, it produces a real and a virtual image of the object in 3D. A copy of the virtual image is always positive. A contact copy of the real holographic image however, is a “negative” image as we can observe in the Shroud image. Photographs of quantum holographic manifestations as recorded for example by Dela Warr’s device show spatially encoded 3D information when subjected to the Bryce Program or VP-8 Image Analyzer, and this is what we can observe in the Shroud image also. Another series of specific Shroud image qualities like the non-directionality, superficiality and the half-tone effect can also be explained with this quantum holographic idea.”","date":"December 8, 2014 at 4:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/11/is-the-shroud-evidence-for-gods-existence/","cat":"other_blogs","title":"Is the Shroud Evidence for God’s Existence?"},{"author":"todd","post":"Hugh, I am sorry to say that it is pretty hard to make a comparison.
