Or were you? : ) The age of Jesus upon starting his ministry IS known and was never disputed, as was never disputed the age at which He died, since both numbers were given in th Gospels and are indirectly confirmed by other dates. So your belief in “green UFO” saga of the age of Jesus at His death is just your belief which is NOT substantiated by anything, even by your own links. You are totally entitled to believe that Jesus Christ died at 42, or 46 or 48, but that is just your belief, no mor, no less – the links you’ve provided on this thread DO NOT confirm that belief..","date":"2013-05-18","mins":"12:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"}]}
