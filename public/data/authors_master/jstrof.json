{"opinion":[{"author":"jstrof","post":"Angl,\nyour absolute dates are simply laughable – nobody and nowhere knows FOR SURE the date of birth of Jesus Christ, ther are stimations which vary from 6 BC to 6 AD, but to name it April 17 of year 6 just makes one laugh, since you sound like you were there . Or were you? :-)\nThe age of Jesus upon starting his ministry IS known and was never disputed, as was never disputed the age at which He died, since both numbers were given in th Gospels and are indirectly confirmed by other dates. So your belief in “green UFO” saga of the age of Jesus at His death is just your belief which is NOT substantiated by anything, even by your own links.\nYou are totally entitled to believe that Jesus Christ died at 42, or 46 or 48, but that is just your belief, no mor, no less – the links you’ve provided on this thread DO NOT confirm that belief.\n\n","date":"May 18, 2013 at 12:08 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/05/06/the-shroud-of-turin-a-bit-scary-for-atheists/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Shroud of Turin:  A bit scary for Atheists?"}]}
