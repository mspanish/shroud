Any school, even in Kansas, can record a presentation and put it up on You Tube. I have tried to contact Dr. Schauf but his email address seems to be a big secret. Since this is a press release, write to Ken Arnold, the school’s director of communications. He should be able to pass on an email to Dr. Schauf. Ken’s email is Arnold K@newmanu.edu.","date":"2010-09-24","mins":"5:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2010/09/22/trial-of-the-shroud-of-turin-at-newman-university-in-wichita/","cat":"history","title":"Trial of the Shroud of Turin at Newman University in Wichita"}]}
