{"resources":[{"id":"comment-24111","author":"jeanine","post":"The Urantia Book is an amazing document. It says nothing about the shroud except that it was thrown over a near by cliff. (meaning it was not destroyed) … but the way they explain why the tomb was empty gives ample evidence that the shroud could be the photographic image of Jesus. His soul resurrected but his body was left behind. The angels were given permission to disintegrate his body in an instant so they wouldn’t have to witness the natural, slow, decomposition of his body. That flash could have created the image, in my opinion. Here’s the quote: “The mortal remains of Jesus underwent the same natural process of elemental disintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth except that, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution was greatly accelerated, hastened to that point where it became well nigh instantaneous.” 189:2.8 If the Urantia Book is a fake, it’s a doozy! Every word is the highest and best use of the English language, there is no one making money on it, and it asks us to look for the good in all religions that bring man closer to God. Most people just keep a closed mind and won’t really read it..","date":"2013-02-12","mins":"11:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/09/the-urantia-book-again/","cat":"books","title":"The Urantia Book Again"}]}
