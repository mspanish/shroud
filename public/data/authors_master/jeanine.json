{"resources":[{"author":"jeanine","post":"The Urantia Book is an amazing document. It says nothing\nabout the shroud except that it was thrown over a near-by cliff.\n(meaning it was not destroyed) … but the way they explain why the\ntomb was empty gives ample evidence that the shroud could be the\nphotographic image of Jesus. His soul resurrected but his body was\nleft behind. The angels were given permission to disintegrate his\nbody in an instant so they wouldn’t have to witness the natural,\nslow, decomposition of his body. That flash could have created the\nimage, in my opinion. Here’s the quote: “The mortal remains of\nJesus underwent the same natural process of elemental\ndisintegration as characterizes all human bodies on earth except\nthat, in point of time, this natural mode of dissolution was\ngreatly accelerated, hastened to that point where it became\nwell-nigh instantaneous.” 189:2.8 If the Urantia Book is a fake,\nit’s a doozy! Every word is the highest and best use of the English\nlanguage, there is no one making money on it, and it asks us to\nlook for the good in all religions that bring man closer to God.\nMost people just keep a closed mind and won’t really read\nit.\n\n","date":"February 12, 2013 at 11:34 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/02/09/the-urantia-book-again/","cat":"books","title":"The Urantia Book Again"}]}
