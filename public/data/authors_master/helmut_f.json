The question is, what evidence speaks against, what evidence speaks for it. There is indeed the Dilemma that there is much evidence that the dating was terribly wrong and that there seems no convincing Explanation. What speaks against fraud? The Magnitude of the scandal and the question of the Motive (in my eyes there is a big Motive to assign a “not authentic” to the Shroud for the church, but this is another Thing. What speaks for fraud? I think a lot of things. One has to look very carefully to the behaviour of the People in 1988 and also later. But the main questions are: why have all free existing pieces of the shroud been confiscated shortly after the results have been proclaimed and any new carbon dating strictly forbidden. Enough material for dozens of datings has been cut off the Cloth during the “Restauration” 2002 – why was None used for a new dating – this time under clean circumstances? Why is the Cloth shut away since more than 25 years for any Independent Research? The question could be clarified very quickly. Why does the church so firmly hang on the worng dating?.","date":"2014-06-01","mins":"10:05 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/30/the-collapse-of-the-fraud-theory/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"The Collapse of the Fraud Theory"}]}
