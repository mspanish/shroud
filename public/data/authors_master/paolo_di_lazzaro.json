And usually the (formal) problem is easily solved by a blind review procedure. As an example, I faced a similar spot when I submitted two papers for publication in the Proceeding volume of IWSAI (International Workshop on the Scientific approach to the Acheiropoietos images). I was co author of two papers and at the same time editor of the Proceedings and responsible for the choice of the Referees. I solved this problem asking to a colleague to manage the review procedure: select the Referees, receive from each Referee the anonymous review, and send me the same reviews. She received my reply and the corrected paper and she sent it to the Referees for the final response. In summary, there are simple rules to avoid a conflict of interest. It is likely Jull followed the same method..","date":"2011-01-28","mins":"12:58 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/01/23/again-the-issue-of-peer-review/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Again, the Issue of Peer Review"}],"forensic":[{"id":"comment-3373","author":"paolo_di_lazzaro","post":"Ron is right, there are at least two different scourge marks, or three, not due only to flagrum.

Be careful when you write about “blood stains” connected to scourge marks. Prof. Baima Bollone, (who had direct access to the Shroud and made the most reliable analyses of the blood on the Shroud) claims the scourge marks are not blood stains. They just reproduce a sort of imaging of bruises. I am not competent to judge he is right or not, but I tend to consider more reliable the observations of (the few) people who had direct access to the Shroud, rather than the opinions of Scholars (like me) that never had a chance to touch and see closely the Shroud..","date":"2011-07-22","mins":"11:34 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/not-true-the-shroud-of-turin-and-flagrum-proportions-and-measurements-are-identical/","cat":"flagrum","title":"Not True: The Shroud of Turin and Flagrum Proportions and Measurements Are Identical"},{"id":"comment-3388","author":"paolo_di_lazzaro","post":"Dear Mr Clément, I am confident you will forgive me if I give more relevance to the opinion of a worldwide recognized expert of forensic medicine that gave a close look to the Shroud rather than to your opinion, based only on indirect information and probably without a specific professional skill in medicine. Professor Baima Bollone is a physician specialized in forensic medicine and in his career he analyzed more than one thousand corpses, and I am sure he can recognize if a stain is from blood or not. Concerning the paper of Miller ad Pellicori, you should know that every fluid secretion by our body is fluorescent under UV light illumination. As a consequence, the fluorescent rings observed by Miller may be due to exudate from the wounds, and not necessarily from serum in the blood. So, you may recognize that your “very good argument” and “facts” maybe not so good at a closer examination. The main point is that the Shroud was studied by hundreds of highly skilled experts in many different fields, and despite this, after more one hundred years we are still without a definitive explanation or conclusion. This means Shroud is a very difficult topic, and the only hope is to continue to study by using the most advanced instruments and technology. Again, I repeat we are in the realm of hypotheses, and among them “the best ones” are usually those formulated by skilled experts, scientists, historians and medicians (as far as I know not by bloggers, sorry). Warm regards.","date":"2011-07-23","mins":"10:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/07/21/not-true-the-shroud-of-turin-and-flagrum-proportions-and-measurements-are-identical/","cat":"flagrum","title":"Not True: The Shroud of Turin and Flagrum Proportions and Measurements Are Identical"}]}
