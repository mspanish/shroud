That helps immensely. 20,000 dots per centimeter. That is absolutely amazing. You know on Sony Vegas Video Editing Software, I can capture 100 different photos of a one second frame, separate each one, then put them back together and then elongate the one second time shot. So we could see in a period of say, 30 seconds, what happened in one second. Meaning to elongate each 1/100th of a second shot so the human eye can see what is happening. I think that is the only way to illustrate the resurrection, because it was a short wave high frequency light source involved in Shroud image. Play it out in slow motion, and then a few shots at regular speed. The flash of lightening type shot, then the slow motion shot of a living cell firing off a laser beam. I want to make some kind of educational film using simple words and displays to talk about Shroud image formation. Real up close and graphic displays. Hopefully be able to finish before Christmas.
