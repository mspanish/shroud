{"dating":[{"author":"r_k_moore","post":"Has Professor Dawkins reviewed any of the evidence undertaken more recently regarding the nature of the Turin shroud, the image on it and its relationship to the sudarium of Oviedo?  The “It’s from the middle ages and nobody has any documentation of it from before then” line was pretty much blown out of the water yonks ago so far as I can see.  And, actually it appears to have been the scientists who screwed up. Again.  Because they didn’t bother to check their results or primary source material? The Professor does a lot of shooting his mouth off, sorry, expresses a lot of faith in his own opinions, for somebody who doesn’t always seem up to speed or particularly interested in others’ research.  If you want to see how much scientific enquiry goes on on the dawkins.net site visit richarddawkins.net/articles/644304-turin-shroud-resurrected.  There doesn’t seem to be much science or reason there from his disciples. More like the gibberings of pre-pubescent chimps trying to establish which Colobus monkey they’d like to abuse. Visit http://www.shroud.com/  for the beginnings of a more interesting and informed – and certainly more polite study, whatever your personal take on religion or 1st century philosophers.","date":"August 22, 2012 at 10:28 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2009/10/20/richard-dawkins-on-the-shroud-of-turin/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Richard Dawkins on the Shroud of Turin"}]}
