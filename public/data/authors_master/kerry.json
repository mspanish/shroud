{"art":[{"id":"comment-3797","author":"kerry","post":"I read this great book in a few hours and I had chills almost the whole time. That’s because after my father past away in march 2009 I was deployed to Afghanistan and after 4 5 months after he past I got a visit from my father in a dream. First I was freaked out and asked him how he could be here when he had died. And he told me that he was ok but he was worried about my brother and sister. I started to cry bad because I had seen him and I knew that this was the real thing. As he looked at me I knew it was him but a younger 25 30 year old. And he knew that I was upset and I had that feeling that he knew I wasn’t ready to see him but he was happy. So he walked off and I woke up crying and a friend that was next to me asked that same day if I was ok and I told him what had happen. And to this day I could tell you and draw you what everything looked like and what he was wearing. And he wore white with a blue ribbon “or whatever people call them” around his body. But I know what I had seen and I read things in that book that I had seen. And I thank God everyday for getting to see him..","date":"2011-09-06","mins":"5:40 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
