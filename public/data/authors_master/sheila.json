The very small minority that abstain are just that. It’s that they speak louder than we do. We don’t go after them but they’re on a mission to come after us wherever we happen to be. As Frank Turek says, “I don’t have enough faith to be an atheist.” That fellow, Thomas, is confused between scientific evidence which has been continuous since the STRP Team went in, and the writings in the Bible. None of the Scientists’ evidence becomes proof of the Bible. It’s purely scientific–nothing to do with religion. That is until you realize the implication of the Shroud. Scientists do not know how it was imprinted. They do know it was not painted. They do know it portrays a man crucified according to the Roman penchant for torture. Therefore when faced with the “evidence” one must make a decision. Either believe the science or don’t. You can’t have it both ways guys!.","date":"2012-06-28","mins":"9:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/19/who-is-evolving-into-stupid/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"Who is Evolving Into Stupid?"}],"art":[{"id":"comment-31785","author":"sheila","post":"I loved the book, it was very refreshing.

He then sprinkled the pollen on the cloth at various points making certain to put a little extra where the crown of thorns was on the head. Not only that, but he dabbed a smattering of limestone near the crucified man’s feet that is only present in Jerusalem. I’VE GOT IT, I’VE GOT IT, I’VE GOT IT!! The forger was a time traveler who came from our future and went back to our past just to mess with us!! I say that because of the pollen.
