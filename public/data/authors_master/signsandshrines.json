{"textile":[{"author":"signsandshrines","post":"About seven years ago I attended a prayer meeting at a catholic church in Abercynon . We were praying the holy rosary, at the end of prayer meeting the holy face of the shroud appeared around the crucifix on the altar. There were ten people present eight were able to see it, two were unable to see it. If you look at the face on the shroud you will notice a cross of light across the forehead and down the nose area. This is exactly where the crucifix also appeared to line up with it in the church.\n","date":"February 8, 2014 at 12:04 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/shroud-scope-10-my-very-own-gallery-of-20-close-up-views-of-the-shroud-all-lightly-photo-edited-for-optimised-colour-differentiation-25/","cat":"brightness","title":"Shroud Scope 10:  my very own gallery of 20 close-up views of the Shroud – all lightly photo-edited for optimised colour-differentiation"},{"author":"signsandshrines","post":"Hello Colin, (I apologize for the late reply).  A lady by the name of Helen asked if anyone could see anything on the altar. We all looked, I saw nothing at first, then looking at the crucifix I suddenly saw the face of the shroud appear in soft light form. There was a man by the name of Paul present there and we simultaneously said together, “it’s the face from the shroud of Turin” we all saw it, with the exception of the priest father Michael Cronin and another man. Eight of us witnessed it.\nRoger.\n","date":"August 6, 2015 at 7:33 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/shroud-scope-10-my-very-own-gallery-of-20-close-up-views-of-the-shroud-all-lightly-photo-edited-for-optimised-colour-differentiation-25/","cat":"brightness","title":"Shroud Scope 10:  my very own gallery of 20 close-up views of the Shroud – all lightly photo-edited for optimised colour-differentiation"}]}
