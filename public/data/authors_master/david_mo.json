What is your reference source?Do you intend to say “esoteric symbol”? I think you confused concepts:In semiotics applied to art a symbol is an object representing an abstract idea. The empty coffin symbolizes immortality. You say that the circles and broken lines in the codex Pray are signs of another object: the shroud. Well, they are signals, but not symbols.Any sign or symbol is understood within a cultural framework. In the twentieth century Western culture a raised fist means “I am a communist.” In the culture of the Sumerians a raised fist meant nothing. In the world of twentieth century sindonism circles with broken lines represent the Shroud of Turin. Among sindonists the fabric weft and the “poker holes” are frequently discussed. So they can interpret the image. In the medieval cultural context, four holes and broken lines meant nothing. Because nobody in the Middle Ages identified the poker holes or the weave of the Shroud of Turin. No witness referred to them until the twentieth century. These details were not significant. And this applies to the Shroud of Turin and other cloths that represent the image of Jesus in a miraculous way. A Hungarian miniaturist who had access to this information is highly unlikely. An artist who painted these things to represent the linen of Turin would be a lunatic. Nobody would have understood him. Max, his theory about the Pray codex is just absurd.

First, you must establish a list of similarities and differences. Not enough with the similarities. Second, you must consider if similar features could not be produced by other circumstances which do not involve copying.For the Codex Pray: The “sindonists” do not consider the important differences between the codex and the image of the Turin cloth. Only similarities. Bad method. Then, the “sindonists” not consider that the characteristics they define as unique can be found easily in medieval art. The artist painted codex Pray according to usual conventions of his time. He could take the position of the arms, the absence of thumbs, etc., from other paintings of the time. Even the nude. The assumption that only did it from the Shroud of Turin is unnecessary and unlikely. You can group arbitrarily a number of features of a work of art that does not exist in another and pretend it is unique. In the same way you can arbitrarily group two sets of characteristics of two works of art and say that they alone possess them. Especially if your knowledge of medieval art is not very deep. This can be done even with to works of different periods. It is an arbitrary procedure that proves nothing. Bad method.Obvious errors in the methodology explain why hardly any medieval art expert supports the thesis of “sindonists” on identifying Pray Codex and the Shroud of Turin images. And found on this flawed methodology the cancellation of a prestigious test as the carbon-14 is a mistake.

The only consistency we are talking about is similarity. And I said before the “similarities” that are not real or are not significant. The codex Pray is not only “consistent” with the Shroud of Turin in some aspect. It is also “consistent” with other images. And in some respects “inconsistent” with the shroud.Yes, the artist had painted a body image if he wanted to represent a body image. An angel if he wanted represent an angel. And a woman if he wanted to represent a woman. No holes, crosses and broken lines for represent Christ image.

Your “suggestions” are a personal matter.I don’t know what you mean by “cutting” and keep off the shroud. If the angel stepped on the shroud (set his foot on it) this would be a blasphemy in the iconographic and religious context of the time.

It includes at least two. You pass from “I do not know” to “nobody knows”. And from “nobody knows” to “there is not”. Logically inconsistent. How do you base your assertion that nobody knows painted shrouds in the Middle Ages? I believe that such a claim could only make it emphatically by an expert in medieval art and plenty substantiate on the material studied. In this forum no one has mentioned an expert of such characteristics.Furthemore, I do not claim neither existed or nor painted shrouds. My reasoning is much easier to understand.1. There were at least 40 shrouds of Christ in the Middle Ages.2. One of those shrouds at least was known and had a full body image. De Clari mentioned it.3. About 1350’ there was in Europe an intense and lucrative trade of relics.4. About 1350’ there were several canvases with the image of Christ “not made by human hands.” For example, the Veil of Veronica had been a resounding success in Rome.5. There were pictures (frescoes and manuscripts) representing Christ in the tomb in the same position of the Shroud of Turin.6. There were pictures of Jesus naked. Many of them represent baptism.6a. I have put here a 12th century image representing the embalming with naked Christ..7. It is possible that a forger or forgers group decided to make a relic with those characteristics that represent the true shroud of Christ mixing all these precedents (common models of its time).8.

It is not true that the image of Christ of Saint Catherine is the first in which he appears with a beard, the book in one hand and extending the other. Despite what is stated, the bearded Christ is a representation existed since the early Christian centuries (For example: Christ between alpha and omega in catacomb of Comodilla). He symbolized the Divine Wisdom and some relate it to the Arian controversy. In the basilica of Santa Pudenziana in Rome is an image of Christ in Majesty, bearded with a book in hand and the other extended. Although the mosaic was restored Christ’s image is of the 5th century. Perhaps the claim that the icon of St. Catherine is the first Pantocrator refers to the first Christ’s image to which that meaning is attributed. However, the concept of Pantocrator is 4th century.

This little example is enough to understand that the probability that the Shroud was at the origin of these icons is highly probable.Your argument begins with an error and an unverifiable assumption. The error is that what we call “Pantocrator” is not a concrete image that was located anywhere. It is an iconographic category designating all the images that represent God in his power, or God Almighty. We need not suppose that there was a first christian pantocrator that was copied from others. The image was evolving from that of Zeus Pantocrator up to a canonical form. Speaking of copies “of the Pantocrator” is meaningless. It’s like talking about copies of “The Madonna” or copies of “The Holy Women.” The second assumption is unverifiable. There were copies of the Mandylion, but we do not know how the original or copies were. What we know are recreations made from imaginary descriptions. So we can have no certainty about the original-copy relations in the case of the face of Edessa.So, your argument loses all sense.

I think there is another possibility. The painter of the Codex Pray is using an iconographic framework. He intend to paint some thing as the Ingeeburg Psalter (Musée Condé, Chantilly, 1195 circa). (http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/856/ingeburgchantilly.jpg/) . Or this one:http://www.photo.rmn.fr/cf/htm/CSearchZ.aspx?o=&Total=34&FP=63233701&E=2K1KTSGGDDHHR&SID=2K1KTSGGDDHHR&New=T&Pic=25&SubE=2C6NU0TPSXFQ.

You can see how the idea of linen which continues on the back or the hands of the characters is a commonplace at the time. But not everyone has the same idea of continuity. I prefer the comparison with the Book of Hours. Life of Saint Margheritte because it coincides perfectly with the folds under the head and feets that represent the end of linen at this point. The same that Mr. Jones marks with green. And you can see that the concept of the wrapping sheet is different to the shroud of Turin. It is a lateral wrapping.In any case, I would not draw hasty conclusions from a glance on the picture. You have to know a lot of medieval art. And do not think that the Codex Pray artist paints directly what your eyes see or your imagination dictates him. In the Middle Ages there were iconographic models. And the artists use those models.

Though whether the top and bottom images on the PM  are both actually the shroud seems debatable. Some nice puzzles to think over.BTW Do you know what is being depicted but the long extended cross extending from the bottom image to the top image? There almost seems to be a detached hand holding the cross.If there are the same opportunities of truth for hypothesis A and hypothesis B, we say we do not know if either A or B. That is, we do not know if the painter of the codex had seen the shroud of Turin. That is what some sindonists are trying to prove.But I think  one of the two hypotheses is extraordinary. It is extraordinary that a monk from a Hungary monastery had information about the type of weave of a cloth exposed to the crowd in Constantinople. And remarkably, the monk had chosen represent this instead the image. I do not know similar cases in medieval art. And extraordinary events require extraordinary evidence. No such evidence exists; so we can say that it is very unlikely that the Pray codex represents an image of the Shroud of Turin.Moreover there are strong indications or evidence that the image of the codex Pray is not inspired by the Shroud of Turin. For example: The sindonists emphasize the anomalous position of the marks of blood on the hands. They think it is a specific feature of the Shroud of Turin that is not found elsewhere. But the hand marks in the codex Pray are in the palms, as in almost all works of art. Therefore we can say for sure hat the Codex Pray artist had no information about the Shroud of Turin.For the first reason I would be skeptical about the Pray Codex is inspired by the Shroud of Turin. For the next two I can say that I am sure that this is not true.PS: Ingeburg (or Ingeborg) in English, not “Ingeeburg”. Sorry for my error.

Moreover, there is another important context for understanding the presence of a shroud in Constantinople in 1204 and the shroud of Lirey in 1350: the frenzy market of relics broke out in Europe at that time. A lot of relics manufactured in the Middle East was spread out by the courts of Europe at great prices. Even small religious centers participated in it. Thus it arose forty shrouds, several holy face, boxes of nails of Calvary, forests of the Holy Cross, feathers of archangels, liters of Jesus’ blood and other nonsense.

I find these statements are meaningless and I explain why:“These are the main features shared in common between the Shroud and the PM. But a more complete list includes at least twelve (12) unique features shared between the PM and the Shroud:“1.Jesus is naked (uniquely in the medieval era);”False. “2.His hands are crossed over His pelvis;”Irrelevant. It is a normal position in the entombment representation. In the case of Christ or others.“3.Jesus’ right hand is over His left;”Irrelevant for the same reason. “4.there is a nail bloodstain in His right wrist (Plate IV);”Subjective. I don’t see it at all. “5.no thumbs are visible;”Irrelevant. It is a normal position in the medieval imagery when the hands are crossing. “6.Jesus’ fingers are very long;”Irrelevant. It is a normal representation of the hands at iconography of the time.“7.there is a mark above Jesus’ right eye corresponding to the reversed `3′ bloodstain on the Shroud of Turin;”Subjective. I don’t see it. “8.the Shroud is more than double the body’s length;”And…?“9.the Shroud has a herringbone weave pattern;”Irrelevant. There is not any representation of herringbone weave in the Pray picture. There is gravestone ornaments. You can find similar ornaments on others gravestone medieval representations.“10.the Shroud has an L-shaped pattern of four `poker holes’;11.and another pattern of five `poker holes’;”Subjective. There are groups of five or eight holes and you can bring them together as you like. Never in form of “P”, as in the codex Pray.“12.the end of the PM’s shroud below Jesus’ feet (upper scene) has a ragged edge which corresponds with (i.e. does not perfectly match) the Shroud of Turin’s, with the latter’s missing corner not yet removed.”Subjetive. I don’t see it. And it is absurd, because you can find millions pictures of cloth pieces as the Shroud of Turin before being cut.In short: all the alleged identity between the image of Turin and the Codex Pray are false, absurd, irrelevant or subjective. I can show examples of all the statements I have made, but I think they are unnecessary because any amateur of medieval art known them. But I shall do it if you wish.But it is easy to find some important differences. These differences show us that the author of the Codex Pray illustrations had not in mind the linen of Turin when drawing.1.There is no direct representation of the shroud with the imprint of Christ, as one would expect in a medieval illustration that would represent it. The idea that the artist’s left esoteric “marks” for “connaiseurs” interpretation is contrary to the canons of medieval painting.2.There are no marks of blood in the codex illustrations (CPI). (Only one exception: small marks in the hands without blood yarns). In the Shroud of Turin are abundant.3.In the CPI the shroud ends at shoulders. It can’t wrap the head.4.In another image of the CP hand injuries are on the palm, not near the wrist as in the Shroud of Turin.5.In the CPI Jesus has a small beard.6.The structure and form of the CPI are typical of the iconography of the Holy Women at the Tomb. The angel is sitting on the grave and he shows them the shroud (the creased cloth).7.It is unthinkable that a Christian artist of the Middle Ages paints the angel stepping on the Christ Shroud. What is under the foot of the angel is the tombstone, not the shroud.Therefore, it is clear that the representation of the Codex Pray has nothing to do with the image of the Shroud of Turin. (I apologize for my English. It is not my usual language, obviously. I hope it’s intelligible at least and you don’t spend long time decrypt it, as Mr. Jones uselessly spends with the Codex Pray).","date":"June 2, 2012 at 3:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/27/jones-on-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript-codex-as-discussed-in-wikipedia/","cat":"art","title":"Jones on the Hungarian Pray Manuscript Codex as discussed in Wikipedia"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Yannick: The codex Pray date is 1192-5.

The baptism scene you show me has nothing to do with the Shroud or the Passion of Christ.Palatine Chapel, Palermo. 12th Century. We talk?Yes, the passion is not baptism. I know. The Pray artist also knew. But he had the same problem as the Palatine Chapel artist: how to paint a naked Christ without showing your sex? The Palatine artist found the solution in water waves. The Pray Codex artist used a conventional resort in the painting of 12th, also common in real burials: hands folded on his abdomen. (See Charles Freeman: The Shroud of Turin and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey On burial practices).Other artists solved the problem differently. They place people in front of the body of Christ. Or putting a cloth napkin. Perhaps the solution of the Pray codex artist was original, but not so original because he used iconographic resources of his time. It is not necessary to resort to a hypothetical visit to Constantinople or a hypothetical vision of a hypothetical shroud of Christ, and so. Too many assumptions.

No one representation of the Shroud of Turin till the modern times portrays him as “faint.” (Fibula, della Rovere, Clovio, etc.) The Shroud of Turin did not look as today at least till the sixteenth century.

You make basic mistakes, like when you say that there was no convention of painting the dead (not the Christ only) with arms crossed over his abdomen. You want examples?2. You talk about identity when speaking of similarity.3. You look only at the similarities and forget differences. Striking differences especially.4. Your theory of the medieval artist who leaves clues “encrypted” is illusory. I have never seen or read anything similar. Medieval artists represented its subject directly or resorted to conventional symbols of his time. Perhaps the Codex Pray is “unique” at this issue also5. You talk about a process of transmission of iconographic motifs that is not real. The art forms do not arise by diffusion of a single work all imitate, even in cases of very famous works in his time.6. You seem to believe that the thing you know matches what exists. In the Middle Ages there was a wealth of manuscripts and paintings now disappeared. Only a few thousands of the hundreds of thousands of manuscripts and paintings survives. These thousands are but the tip of the iceberg. To say that the Codex Pray was the first naked representing Christ in the tomb is naive. In all likelihood is just the tip of the iceberg.Finally: I exposed a plausible method of work for the codex Pray artist that does not involve direct imitation of any painting allegedly existing in Constantinople or anywhere. I have not heard responding to my proposal. Unless the answer is to repeat once more that the codex Pray is the only one that was identical to the Shroud of Turin.

Prove it! It is you that affirm (inconsequently) that the features that matched the altar and the Shroud were common in medieval art. This claim is mine also.

This is elementary logic. For example:See this picture: https://www.flickr.com/photos/ana_sudani/460090622/in/photostream/ . It is a panel of the altar of the cathedral of Lübeck of the beginning of the Fifteenth Century.  There are more coincidences with the shroud of Turin here than in the codex Pray: the beard is divided in two, we can see the wounds of the Passion and the legs are bended. With your logic of more similarities, more copy, we ought to conclude that the artist was copying the shroud of Turin.

In no sense are they in the same category as their contemporary high European art, with all their concomitant artistic styles, and reliance on precedents.The quality or technical skill of an artist is irrelevant to the membership in an artistic style. I don’t know a “Hungarian Gothic style” and the concept of “Prayan” style is inconceivable.  The Pray drawings occur in their context of the very first attempt at producing a written text in the Hungarian language. It may be regarded as a form of primal Hungarian art. This is a common mistake among sindonists. The Pray Codex is an ensemble of texts. Only the Funeral Prayer is written in Hungarian and can be dated in 1192-95, according to E. Poulle. Other parts of the codex include a list of Hungarian kings (till 1210) and a collection of liturgical songs in Latin. The illustrations are inserted in the latter part and can be dated about the beginning of the thirteen Century (1216 as likely ante quem. All these texts and illustrations were influenced by the French and the Italian style. That is to say, they belong to the Gothic style.   Casual inspection of the oblique rectangle in the drawing will show that it has a length to width ratio of very close to 4:1, the same proportions as the Shroud cloth, the very same object that has a zigzag pattern on it, as has the Shroud, and the very same object that has an ‘L’ arrangement of holes. A further characteristic of the Shroud is that it is of fabric, so it need not be represented as having straight sides, but can be curved, without these being symmetrical. A straight edge placed against this rectangle will show the edges are indeed curved, and without the curves being symmetrical about the centre-line.The proportions of the lid aren’t 4:1 (I think you don’t measure the part under the angel that is blurred); the zigzag lines are only vaguely similar to a herringbone; and the holes of the Turin Shroud aren’t in P and L  shape as in the Pray Codex. The surface where the small circles are painted is rigid and differs completely with the representation of cloths and fabrics in the Pray Codex. The angel is seating over it, as is usual in the representations of the scene of the Holy Women. This is the lid of a sepulchre not a sheet. However, all the great men have spoken and have expressed their skepticism all to their own satisfaction no doubt. I for one consider that they have all simultaneously come to an incorrect conclusion. So much for the value of consensus debate!  Every factual sentence is subject to possible rectification.

There is a Spanish joke about Jaimito, his father and the teacher. The teacher was worried about Jaimito because the child saw “things” (non sancta things) in the simple lines sketched by the teacher, and called to Jaimito’s father. But when the father saw the lines (remember that they are only lines)… Well, I cannot translate adequately the joke to English and it is not very suitable for this blog. Let it stay .That’s clealry a bench, what else could it be!Naturlich! Two lines = a bench. Every intelligent man sees this!  But the no-intelligent men see anything; for example, perhaps it is the left angle of the edge of the sepulchre. I think the artist of the Pray Codex was not very skilful. He is probably trying to copy or remember another illustration but paints badly some things. See the sceptre with the cross. Nothing appears to hold it, and there is something as four fingers in an impossible place. Or see the ornament of crosses under the so called shroud. (By the way, the shroud of Turin has not any cross similar to these that are on this alleged shroud of the Pray Codex. It is not a shroud, of course).But this story of the bench that not seems a bench at all intrigues me. How appeared it here? Is the angel who brought it from the heaven? Perhaps he was afraid of having to wait for the Holy Women for too long (the women, you know). Don’t worry if I don’t take too seriously your famous bench. The non-intelligent people don’t be able to understand the theories of intelligent ones. That’s why, all the painters of the Middle Ages  -non-intelligent, of course-, put the angel naturally seated on the sepulchre or on the lid, exactly in the same position of the angel of the Pray Codex. No one has the very intelligent idea to paint a heavenly bench. This is another extraordinary exploit of the Pray Codex… or of your intelligent interpretation of it.In any event, let me abandon you at this point.

(…)There is a considerable weight of documentary evidence that the burial cloths were present in Constantinople. (…)From what we know of Byzantine liturgies, much of it is not for the public gaze.

It is irrelevant if the image was produced immediately after the resurrection or two centuries later, miraculously or made by a forger. If the shroud was known at the time you like, we should have a description or an image of it. This is the point I share with Hugh and Charles.2. Neither of the examples you cite (Constantine VIII, Clari and these other mysterious not specified by you), provide us with a description of the shrouds mentioned that can be compared with the Shroud of Turin. There is no description. There is no way to know if they were painted or not or.

You can not make any comparison of something familiar with something that is not known. The mention of the word “shroud” can not solve the problem.3.

The other pictures are representations of the Holly Shroud in diverse contexts (entombment, lamentationes etc.); the shroud of Turin IS (really or supposedly) the shroud.If we have to compare two pictures, we should compare homogeneous pictures. This is a problem because we know scarcely anything about other shrouds. We compare in fact a shroud with some pictures with a different iconic concept. We are comparing the mark or impression of the Jesus’ body in a shroud with an entombment scene.This implies an important difference when we analyzed the idea and representation of naked Christ in the tomb and also poses a theological and pictorial problem to a painter who wants to paint the image of the body on a shroud of Christ. The Gospels say that Jesus body was wrapped in a clean shroud (Mathew, 27, 59). There are a lot of medieval representations of Christ in the entombment or the resurrection (most common), where the nudity is veiled by a shroud. Obviously, this solution to the problem was not possible with the Shroud. We don’t know what the solution of this problem in other shrouds was, because only a shroud (true or false) has come to us. We can not compare in any way. We only can compare the codex Pray illustration with others with the same motif and to check out that the codex Pray is not the unique case in which the artist has dared to paint Jesus naked. See my gallery. The codex Pray is odd but not exceptional.

Please, read more attentively my words and you will not blunder again. Hugh suggests that the rectangle may be the door of the sepulchre. Maybe. I consider more probable the rectangle represented the lid as in almost all the representations in West Medieval Art. So I see the angel is seated or stepping on a rectangle in the examples from St. Gall and the Cloisters. In the example from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Angel is seated on a sarcophagus. I interpret this form this way on the basis of the figures of sleeping warriors that is an iconographic issue of many representations in the Medieval Western Art.But your interpretation is mainly flawed because you put here some examples of art from different time and styles we are discussing. We are speaking about the Pray Codex and its illustrations -it is to say Thirteenth Century-, and the shroud of Turin (1350 circa as unquestionable date). All my examples (if I remember well) came from the Twelfth to the Fifteenth Centuries. It is to say, a plausible time of impact of both objects in a coherent geographical space and a peculiar style: the Gothic. They are coherent with our subject of discussion. Yours aren’t.However, it matters little that we interpret the rectangle as the lid of a sarcophagus, as in the Western Art, or a door of the Holy Sepulchre, as in the Byzantine tradition (Russian icons included). It matters little if we see the angel sitting or stepping on the rectangle. Therefore, the rectangle ever will be a door or a lid, never a cloth.

We can understand this not by a mere game of appearances, but by the iconographic comparison of this element in a lot of representations. The rectangle takes up the place beside the coffin/sarcophagus as the other unequivocal lids. It is rigid as a lid. It is a lid. In the Eastern Art the thing is ambiguous.

But they show him as sitting or standing on this rectangular object. The gospel records that the tomb was sealed by a rock and there is no mention of a door. Why should the angel be sitting on the door of the tomb, the door is not in the gospel and it’s not scriptural!(…)  But I don’t know that we can be so certain. The images on the TS have sometimes been used to explain the appearance of the angel(s) and I think it’s possible that the ideas may be connected.Now on the HPM, note the position of the angel’s foot. It indicates he is seated (the foot is placed well in front of him), and three lines are sketched at the extreme left of the picture, which suggest to me the bench or shelf on which he is sitting. Furthermore, the oblique rectangle is set in front of the angel and in front of the women, and appears to be resting on the slab underneath, and it is placed in the bottom one-third of the lower picture. That is why I say it is in the foreground. You may call the underlying slab a sarcophagus; I say that it is not obvious as such.Your interpretation begins badly. There are three lines in the back of the angel, but the lower one is the edge of the lid/shroud. Then we have only two lines. And you have not answered my question. You repeat that these lines are a rock shelf (before was a bench) but you don’t explain how two simple lines can be interpreted as a rock shelf instead of a bench or an extension of the coffin (this is more according to the West Art tradition), or another else. Where can you see this rock shelf represented by two lines? How?The angel’s feet are before the lid/shroud. The angel’s position (one leg bent and the other more extended) implies the classical angel seated on the lid or the sarcophagus, resting one foot on the lid. The other examples I put here indicate that the feet (at least one of them) are over the lid/shroud. This one is supported by the empty coffin/sarcophagus, as in the rest of representations at this time. All this obviously discards the “shroud” interpretation. I am ready to accept a correction of the most obvious interpretation but not without good reasons to do it.The ancient illustrators of the Bible rarely were experts on the subject they were painting. They simply copied other images and sometimes added some personal incongruities. Some contradictory, or non biblical, features were repeated and sometimes magnified. For example: the Pray Codex includes two incompatible biblical traditions in the same drawing. In the first, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea are anointing Jesus’ body. This is John 19: 39. In the second, the Holy Women carry still more substances for anointing. This is Mark 16:1 or Luke 24:1. This is an unlikely double anointing that the illustrator of de Pray Codex put together without any objection.","date":"July 7, 2014 at 1:45 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/06/21/discussion-about-the-pray-codex-and-its-relation-to-the-shroud-is-over/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Discussion about the Pray Codex and its relation to the Shroud is over?"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Daveb:Several galleries of Three Mary depictions have been shown.

In intermediate types the angel-slab is not so clearly a lid (the Pray manuscript being one such), but it is skewed, which I have interpreted either as the lid or the door of the tomb being “rolled away,” but could represent the Stone of Unction being thrown over by an earthquake, as daveb suggests.

Vignon marks, L-shaped circles)Population -a set of all objects dervived from the model (eg. byzantine icons of Christ, burial and empty tomb scenes)Frequency of congruences -a fraction of all objects within a population sharing a particular congruence (or set of congruences).I hope definitions are clear now.No. This concept of model doesn’t work in History of Art. The artist never goes to the canvas or the stone with his mind in blank. Specially in the Ancient Art, the artist has passed by a learning process, he has seen other representations of his subject and carries in his mind a model as an iconic structure. This model is dominant even when he is trying to copy an object. (For the concept of iconic structure see my previous comment).This model is easily detectable (not always easily) when comparing a relevant set of works of art. (“congruences in a population”)The individual model (an object) can exist, but it is weighed up by the iconic rules of the structure. In the medieval Art the individual model (another painting, a man) are almost ever undetectable. A few portraits exist as exception. In general, and this is valid even for a genius as Giotto, the structure is predominant. The genius works into the framework of the structure. (See here: http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/uploadedImages/articles/485_Padova-Padua:-Giotto512051.jpg )This is why the aspiration to deduce imitative effects only on the basis of isolated features is doomed to failure.

Paraphrasing you: the angel is seated; his buttocks is placed in contact with this thing consisting of those two lines -as those two lines seem to serve no other function.You paraphrase, proclaim or affirm but never explain anything. If you pretend identify some object X it is necessary to identify the definitory features of this object, what identifies it as an X, not claim some vagueness as “seem to serve no other function”.See this:  What “function serve” the lines in the back of the angel? Are they similar to the Pray Codex? And it is all clear, especially when compared with corresponding description in Mark’s Gospel (16:5, NIV):As they entered the tomb (inside the tomb), they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting (on what?) on the right side.

The medieval conventions imply that the lid of the Three Marys scene was often represented as a rectangle and the angel seated on it. This is just what you can see at the Pray codex.A medieval painter doesn’t paint trails of blood as broken lines (there were other conventional signs for blood) and I don’t know why he would paint a herringbone (bone of fish) as pyramids and a holes series in form of P in order to imitate some holes that had not any form of P.

So, even after the Shroud of Turin was put in public display in France, artists were not willing to depict Christ naked in scenes related to his Passion and death !(…)  Meditate about that my friend !I meditate, Yannick, and you must meditate also. And these are the results of my meditationis:Meditatio Prima: You are wrong again. Why do you not read my preceding comments when I send you to them? I have shown some examples of naked Christ in a date long before to15th century in this forum. For example: Entombment. The Cloisters. 13th Century.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/elissacorsini/2163082112/in/set-72157601070709853/, I don’t know this Jacques Bara, but I think he was not very inspired if he said that. Or he was so an expert as you and I are. Meditatio Secunda: We are simple amateur (more or less) and our knowledge of the history of Art is very limited. (I have read three books on Byzantine Art. And you? Be honest, please). How many entombment or anointing paintings of the 12th Century do you know? Then, why do you ask to me? The lamentatio theme becomes widespread in the 14th and 15th Centuries. It’s the same with vir dolorum, entombments and other subjects around the Christ dead. But there were some examples before. To make generalizations on the basis of a few examples is very hazardous. Even if the Pray Codex was the first example of the naked Christ in the anointing theme known by experts in art, this mean nothing for the Turin Shroud authenticity case. Meditatio Tertia: How many documents do you know about the Christ dead in Byzantine 12th –epitaphioi came after? How many of these spoke about the Christ’s clothes in the tomb? You use an illogical argument: if the Byzantines buried their dead dressed, then they imagined the dead Christ dressed. Illogical. They didn’t bury their dead with a transparent veil, but painted the Christ dead with a transparent veil. Yes, Mesarites could have in mind paintings as this one:  http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/856/ingeburgchantilly.jpg/ ( Ingeburg psalter, 1190 circa), when he was speaking about naked Christ under the Shroud.

He has nothing to do with de Clari’s shroud.","date":"September 13, 2012 at 1:53 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Carlos, you wrote: “Jesús DESNUDO y MUERTO, bajo sábana, sobre sábana … …. o en el camino de la sepultura, es una idea EXTRAÑA (ignoro la razón) a la iconografía de TODAS LAS ÉPOCAS, aún con muy ESCASAS pero notables excepciones, lo que da MÁS VALOR , cuando se muestra desnudo y muerto en la Edad Media, a su posible relación con el CONOCIMIENTO de la existencia de una Sábana con la imagen de Jesús desnudo.En el siglo XIII el “Cloisters” es una excepción, como lo es en el siglo XIV la “mise au tumbeau” de la Iglesia de Onnens o la de la Iglesia de Landes.”You are wrong again. It is not true that the representation of a naked Christ on the shroud or under was an exception. Not only in the Middle Ages, but in the Renaissance and in Baroque period from Mantegna to Rubens the Crhist was naked or covered only by the shroud. He is depicted so by Michelangelo, Boticelli, etc. I have done a little survey in the French Ministère de Culture page for medieval manuscripts. I have looked for Christ in the Tomb enluminures in the 13th to 15th period. Approximately 30% were nude or with a transparent veil that concealed nothing.. So the concept of a naked Christ was a minority, neither “strange” nor “odd”, and it is explain naturally the Mesarites’ reference. My argument is not speculative. I summarize it: Part I.1. When somebody sees an important event and wishes communicate it he mentions it directly. It is “strange” or “odd” to use vague allusions or double meanings when you can say the things directly.2. The Christ’s image on a Shroud would be very important for Mesarites.3. Mesarites doesn’t speak about an image of Christ on the shroud. (By contrast with the Mandylion).4. Mesarites didn’t see any Christ’s image on the shroud. Part II.1. The naked Christ (yes, into, under or over the Shroud) was a normal iconic concept at this time both in prayers or manuscripts specially in rich books of aristocracy or convents.2. Mesarites uses a normal iconic concept of his time. CONCLUSION:  There is nothing “strange” in the Mesarites’ mention to a naked Christ. We don’t need to look for double meanings or pathological/theological inhibitions. There is no “más valor” (whatever this is meant for you) in speculative relations with occult and mysterious references. This is speculative. Not my argument. PS: The idea of naked Christ in the baptism is derived from the idea of St. Paul that Chist is a new Adam and the symbolic significance of Holy Baptism. The refusal of a naked Christ is a logical consequence of the sexual repulsion in the official Christianity.

Mesarites speaks directly about an image of Christ when he is speaking on Mandylion. He says nothing about an image on the sudarium. He says only the sudarium wrapped the Christ’s body and he was naked. This is a frequent idea and icon at this time, i.e. the shroud wrapping naked Christ. There is no reason to suppose he had seen something paint in the sudarium, but he only repeated this ordinary idea. Scavone fantasizes when he matches two sentences: Jesus rises from the tomb in the Resurrection morning (Mesarites) and the cloth is raised (de Clari). They are obviously different subjects: Christ and the cloth.   2. Codex Pray is not a proof of the existence of the Turin shroud. I argued about two or three months ago. (https://shroudstory.com/2012/05/27/jones-on-the-hungarian-pray-manuscript-codex-as-discussed-in-wikipedia/ June 2, 2012, 3:45 and after). We can repeat the debate if you wish. Summary: to match two different icons you must find any feature clearly common and specific to both. There is not this common feature in Codex Pray and Turin shroud. Only a confuse one (“poker holes”) and several not specific others. And there are substantial differences between Pray and Shroud.  3. You wrote: “If the Shroud of de Clari was the same as the Shroud of Turin, I think it’s truly probable that this public showing of this Shroud (maybe the first ever) was one of the cause of this important artistic change concerning the depictions of Jesus related to his Passion, death and burial. Don’t you think it would be logical?”I think this argument is not logic at all. 3.1. The “artistic change concerning depictions of Jesus” doesn’t need a supposed identity de Clari/Shroud of Turin. It was prefigured and followed by other paintings and writings (legends, prayers, etc.) well known. You make a superfluous hypothesis. 3.2. The FACT is they are unknown artifacts in the cultural world at the time. It is incompatible with the impact you suppose. We have abundant testimonies about Christ Chalkites, Camouliana, Mandylion, Veronica’s Veil… We have abundant testimonies about Vera Crux, Thorn Crown, Holy Spear, etc. All these were well known and impacting artifacts. But you hypothesize about a practically unknown object with great cultural impact. This is an oxymoron. 3.3. I can establish a causal relation between two events or objects if, and only if, I can establish factual relations between them. This is not the case with de Clari and Shroud. Only imaginary relations can be established. Imaginary relations aren’t proof of anything.  You haven’t answered my questions: “How this vaporous Shroud can influence all the cultural world of the 13th and before? How can you distinguish if the Shroud de Clari said he had seen is the cause or the effect of cultural attraction about the Christ’s death?”","date":"September 10, 2012 at 3:37 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/09/05/stephen-jones-latest-in-his-never-ending-critique-of-charles-freeman/","cat":"art","title":"Stephen Jones’ Latest in his never-ending critique of Charles Freeman"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Carlos Otal :David Mo:1.- En la iconografía, Jesús desnudo NO ES Jesús con perizonium, por muy transparente que éste sea.2.- En la iconografía Jesús desnudo ( sin perizonium o similar) y muerto ( bajo, sobre….etc, etc) es extraño, raro, singular o poco frecuente, como quiera denominarlo, en el siglo 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 y lo que llevamos del 21….3.-Lo que es CONGRUENTE con la existencia de escasas pero notables excepciones que SI lo muestran desnudo (sin perizonium o similar).4.- Esta escasez iconográfica es MÁS notable con anterioridad a 1355.5.- Su propuesta “Mesarites uses a normal iconic concept of his time”, es una especulación no fundamentada y muy probablemente FALSA.Carlos OtalIt is useless for you and me to discuss how we consider an almost inexistent and very transparent veil.

Seven more were not clear. You can call it how you wish. I say that the iconic concept of the Naked Christ was not very frequent but normally seen in books of prayer and sermons. The hermeneutics’ Golden Rule is: you don’t need to interpret a text if it is neither absurd nor incoherent. The Mesarites’ reference to a naked Christ under the shroud it is neither absurd nor incoherent. Ergo you don’t need any interpretation.

Ray Rogers is the most known example of that.Yannick:To be an expert in some scientific branch it is not “to make a study”, “to devote many hours” or “to speak with clever expert”. Expert scientists have academic studies, years of experience, an important bibliography and are well recognized by their peers (they work together, are present in academic meetings, conferences, etc.). You can be an expert without some of this features, but not without all of them. Rogers is the perfect case of non textile expert. He made two “extraordinary findings”. Red color of the blood in the Shroud is due to saponaria. The samples for radiocarbon dating were taken of an invisible mending. He never demonstrates his first hypothesis (never published nothing about). And Mechthild Flury-Lemberg refuted his theory of invisible mending. Rogers was not an expert and made the typical inexpert mistakes. In STURP there was not an expert textile. They didn’t make any specific previous textile study on the Shroud. And Freeman puts a good example: this is unthinkable for a study of Mona Lisa or similar. No museum director will allow this.

The possibility of an event is a very vague concept (it is physically possible that there are “lunatics” in the Moon and it is metaphysically possible First Motor existence), but he thinks the possibility Mesarites is talking about the Shroud of Turin (under de Clari’s shroud identity), is reinforced by the odd reference to a naked Christ. I don’t think so. This probability is strongly reduced by two facts: 1. The image of a naked Christ under the Shroud was not odd at this time. If it was pictured in the Queen Ingeborg psalter (and others) we can think it was a well known concept at his time. 2. When Mesarites speaks about an icon he mentions it directly. He made an accurate description of the Mandylion. But if he was in front to the “odd” and very important image of Turin Shroud or similar (and Yannick claims both odd and very impacting) it is incomprehensible he stopped talking about. The most impacting relic of the century and he only made a subtle and vague reference to Our Lord’s nudity!  Absolutely unthinkable. Yes, it is possible Mesarites saw the Turin Shroud. It is metaphysically and physically possible. But it is historically very unlikely.

There is not any official statement that says directly that the Shroud is a true relic neither that the radiocarbon dating is valid. The official statement of 1988 plays with a calculated ambiguity. It recognizes that the results of the radiocarbon dating are “compatible” (with what?) and that the scientific advisor that had peered the report of the labs confirms the 95% of certainty… but the report also adds that the origin of the image continues to remain a mystery that needs to be investigated.In my opinion the Catholic Church cannot clearly state the inauthenticity of the cloth without an intern conflict with many believers and without losing an important centre of propaganda.

I am not expert in chemist or microscopy. Neither in textile conservationism. Now then I add some personal remarks: I only know a thing: the appeal to an invisible mending is impossible because the invisible mending is an entelechy. If you give some explanation, it has to be coherent with the facts and you cannot invent inexistent entities. When we are speaking of doubts about the authenticity of an artefact every precaution must be taken. The radiocarbon team did the correct thing when rejecting Raes’ samples.

First of all, an inquiry as you propose would have to be carried on by a competent team of Art historians. I’m not an expert on medieval Art at all, but I know that some essential features of Byzantine Art have been ignored by Vignon and other zealous amateur inquirers (1) and the mistakes due both to the inexperience as the lack of method can invalidate their efforts. Internet aids, but is not the answer.But last but not least, if this imaginary team will arrive to conclude that there will be some relevant similarities between the Byzantine Art and the Shroud, we have not resolved our problem because we have no reason to think that the Shroud influenced the Byzantine Arte and not conversely. Even if we can demonstrate similarity between the Byzantine Art and the Shroud this is not the basis for any argument in favour or counter authenticity, because the Byzantine influence in European Art arrives till the fall of Constantinople (1453). Sindonism and scepticism will be compatible with it. Hence, I think the relations of the Shroud with Art is an interesting and curious issue, but not relevant to the authenticity case.

I consider that O.K. makes a valid point that many of the Christ icons do show Vignon markings, and when they occur, they are consistently more frequent than such markings on non-Christ portraits. It would not be uncommon for artists to imitate such features as Vignon markings in portraits of their other subjects. Who can enter the mind of an artist? Icons of Christ do show Vignon Marks? This is a confusing expression. Some icons of Christ show some combination of Vignon’s marks and other icons of Crhist show different combinations. Some Vignon’s marks are clearly visible (for example 15) and other are subjective. Some marks are visible only in some phtographies with some specific contrast. Etc. I have done my personal inquiry about Vignon’s marks on 44 instances of Christ’s images from Sixth Century to Fourteenth Century. This is a very imperfect study (as Wilson, and others) because I can not keep in mind thousand of manuscripts, woods, icons, frescoes, etc. I have focused my study on some instances of Byzantine images or influenced by Byzantine Art, iIncluding those usually quoted by sindonists.  Only marks 1, 10, 11, 12 and 15 are regularly present in these images and can see clearly. The marks 5, 6 7 or 8 are practically inexistent, the same as the combination 2, 3 and 4. The mark 13 has two different ways of representation. In the same form as in the Shroud, i.e. has a soft curve (http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Painting/Fajum44.jpg) , is scarcely represented in the examples I have consulted. It is more frequent as an angular form (http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Painting/Fajum2.jpg). First problem: Marks 1, 10, 11 and 13 in both forms are common marks to a lot of portraits of these times and even before. Then, we have only two marks that can be considered identifying of Christ: 12 (divided beard) and 15 (lock of hair).But in some portraits of John the Baptist (for example) we can see the same lock of hair. Evidently here it doesn’t represent any blood stain, but only a lock of hair. Why do you think that the same lock of hair represents a blood stain in the Byzantine representation of Christ? Have you any reason to think so? Surely not. I haven’t heard any explanation of this arbitrary interpretation. So, even in the supposition that the 15 Vignon’s marks were present in the Shroud (and I don’t see more of six or seven), there is not any “extraordinary coincidence” between these marks and the Byzantine iconography of Christ when we examine better the facts.","date":"May 15, 2014 at 3:33 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/05/13/vignon-was-wrong-but-well-carry-on/","cat":"history","title":"Vignon Was Wrong But We’ll Carry On"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"The game is over.

There is not strange that you find a massive range of ‘occurences’ of Vignon/Wilson’s marks because you handle incomprehensible norms of comparison. Some examples: – The Holy Faces of Genoa (XVIII and XIX) and Vatican have a beard divided (????).– The Christ of the Shroud has rings under de eyes. (???) And  leptons.– You do a ‘liberal’ intrpretation of mark 14 (rings under the eyes). But then, almost all the roman portraits of adult men, specially philosophers and emperors, have the same mark. It is not a characteristic feature of portrait of Christ! Nobody needed to copy nothing, but follow a pictorical convention thoroughly established.– You believe that two or three hairs sometimes almost invisible (VIII) are “similar” and “inspired” by a strong spiral form of blood(Shroud). (???) In Spain we say that this analogy “está traída por los pelos” ( is farfetched; literally: ‘brought by the hair’). Never better said. Have you any reason to suppose the first artist’s intention that converted the blood to hair or it is a mere supposition?Etc., etc. You should not be blamed by have claimed these nonsense.

Have you any reason to think so?OK:  One should remember that John the Baptist was born just a half year before his cousin Christ, so he is often portayed in the fashion similar to the latter. So in some occasions, he “inherited” the lock from Jesus. And that’s nothing unimaginable.This is not any reason. This is an ad hoc supposition. You and I can “imagine” a lot of things. But they are mere speculation before we be able to provide a proof of them. Meanwhile a lock of hair is a lock of hair and two locks of hair are two locks of hair. The mark 13 can be represented in various ways, but the most important point is that it is represented.Absolutely incorrect. You can not match two portraits because they represent two eyes, a brow, a mouth or some wrinkles in the neck. If it were so, we will match any portrait to another. You can match two portraits if the features are represented in the same form. And the form of the wrinkle in the neck of the Shroud (that actually is not) is very different of the wrinkle of the neck of the most part of Christ’s images we are analyzing. But these latter are very similar to many roman portraits. I think you will be able to extract the adequate inference.  And why forger should copy all those tiny features from Byzantine icons into the Shroud?The sole feature common to the Shroud and the standard representation of Christ in the medieval art that might be clearly observable is the divided beard. All the other are based either on subjective vision or ad hoc inferences. Or they are not distinctive of Christ, but present in many other portraits. Without entering in some evident differences between the Shroud and the standard representation of Christ. There is no much to speculate about forgers.Advice: When you present a series of examples of Art pictures is technically advisable to identify them.

First came the blood stains and then as much as 48 hours latter, likely no more than, 40 hours, the image came into existence by a yet unknown process.Trying to create a unified picture of blood and the image can only go so far. Yes there are blood stains in positions consistent with the image. That doesn’t mean they were created simultaneously..If the image was created an instant when the body and the Shroud “parted company” then it is clear the blood stains were, to borrow a phrase from our fundamentalist brothers and sisters, “Left behind.”Because of writing I have been dealing with multispectral digital imaging (MSDI) for a couple of weeks. of weeks. I think it may very well be that with MSDI we can strip away layers of accretions from the Shroud and get a definitive picture of the Shroud even before there were any markings on it.; the markings at the time Christ was first wrapped in the Shroud and the markings when the image was created. OMGAll theories I know assume that there is a match between the blood stains and specific body parts that would be their origin. The discussion is particularly sensitive in the case of the exact position of the marks in the hand. There may be variations about two cm (Lavoie), but no more. I do not understand why the streaks of blood on the neck must obey a different law. I do not understand what part of the human body could they proceed without causing significant distortions of the fabric. (The neck is more than ten cm from the other parts of the body and the cloth of the shroud is a continuum that shows no important deformation).

The hypothesis of Dr. Lavoie is a cloth that rests on the body first and then become more flat. First the blood and then the image were printed. So the actual position of the blood stains has to be moved one or two cm. The trickles actually run on the face and not on the hair. This is impossible to apply to the back of the neck, where there is only the hair surface where the trickles can emerge and run.I regret not having time now to devote to the problem of the absence of crushing surfaces in contact with the slab.

No one understands that Vignon Marks are relevant not because they cannot occur without the Shroud (they can in some occasions), but because of statistical analysis the frequency of their occurences?There is not any statistical survey about the Vignon marks. The matching is done only on a range lesser than 20 instances. This is scandalously insufficient. As Hugh says, it is not difficult to find some icons with similar features that not correspond to the Crhist image. And some icons of Christ that not matched the Vignon marks.But there is worse. The same concept of Vignon marks is erroneous. For example, some alleged marks of Vignon do not exist. Surely, M. Vignon worked with a picture of small seizure or similar. But now we can easily enlarge the picture with any image processor. In doing so, some marks disappear because they are features of the photo not of the actual image. Let us see what occurs with the marks 2 and 3. (For Vignon marks I’m using: http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2158/24301214.jpg.

They are seen with a lot of difficulty in a desktop size, but when enlarged a few we will see immediately as the marks will disappear. We only catch approximately the marks 2 and 3 if we contrast adequately a picture of small size in negative. Of course this is a resource that was not in reach of the people of the Byzantine Empire.

The Shroud is the image of the trace of a corpse on a sheet as imagined by a medieval artist”.So you cannot ask for other medieval images that had deceived some pathologists. “I challenge Hugh to identify any single work of art, not a photograph, but whether monochrome or not, whether on linen or not, that has been successful in persuading reputable and experienced forensic pathologists, that the subject was actually a real person, alive or not, and not actually a product of a mere artist’s skill”.This is a wrong question. First of all because the usual medieval images (we are speaking of the Gothic period, are we not?) is not made to simulate the imprinting of a corpse on a sheet. This is the main purpose of the author or the Shroud and it is not the same of crucifixions, descents from the Cross and entombments of the epoch. Secondly, and derivated from the first point, there is not any believers’ group oriented to show that Mantegna’s, Martini´s or Giotto’s works are real imprints of a corpse. Obviously, they are not.And I had also written: “I be grateful if someone explains me what are the stylistic features of the Shroud that  do not correspond to the Gothic style. We can say the schools of Firenze or Siena, for example. Or the Franc-Flemish style, if you like”.That is to say, even with different purposes, the image of the Shroud and the pictures of the last Gothic period have some similarities. Stretched features (specially the fingers and the nose), short blonde hair, swollen belly, broad pectorals, etc., are some striking similarities and I am sure that an expert on Gothic art (Wesselow not, of course), will find some others. And I have already shown on another occasion that Gothic artists had a good anatomical knowledge similar to the image of the Shroud, if not better. NOTE: I say that not Wesselow because he makes the same mistake as usual between sindonists: he denies that the Shroud is a work of art. I agree.

There are not clear conclusions, no criterion to selection, unwarranted inductions and an absolute misunderstanding of the History of Art.  I cannot answer to your questions because they are incorrectly stated. For example, you asked: “-the reduction of number of nails presented in crucifixion portrayals, from 4 to 3?”The question is badly poosed because there is not a single reason for this reduction, there is not a unique process of reduction and the answer makes no sense if we don’t precise this points.There are some periods and some artists that have represented three nails and other four nails. This depends of theological conventions about what is the correct way to see the Christ and of artistic conventions also. The reasons why the normal iconography of the 10th century shows a Christ with four nails are different from the same feature in Velazquez’s Christ. (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/Cristo_crucificado.jpg/300px-Cristo_crucificado.jpg). In the first case the Christ is represented in is Majesty even when it was in the Cross. His hieratic attitude, that include his open arms, is the proper representation of the Power (also the power of the Emperor and his court). In the second case, Velazquez, is the result of Counter-Reform. The crossed legs were considered as an indecent position, and a more static position was recommended by relevant religious authorities (Cardinal Bellarmino, for example). This implies four nails, obviously. In the middle, polemics about the number of nails were spread across Europe when the Cathar Crusade.

These and other dramatic events produced a reduction of one third of the population and some heretic and ascetics movements.

Chance or the limits of knowledge are important determinant in historical explanation. You are an ignorant in History if you don’t know this.2.In absence of any explanation you cannot accept the first explanation that comes to your mind. Specially when we are spoken of particular in History. You are an ignorant in History if you don’t know this.3.The priority of the right over the left. Right is the saint side of the things, left is the devilish side. (The artist of the Shroud probably didn’t think he was doing a replica by contact and changed the side of the bound and the hands. This is not his unique mistake from a naturalistic point of view. See the hair).4. If we have a tendency toward an end (substitution of the 4 nails by 3) that begins in a point and grows toward another, you cannot say that the cause of the arrival to the end is in the half of the process. If you had done the simple quest I have suggested you would had understand that the change from 4 nails to 3 is progressive. You will find no crucifixions with three nails in the early centuries of Christianity. Scarcely one in the 11th century. Some in the 12th century. Many in the last half of the 13th century.

You cannot attribute a wide effect of change in history (of Art) to an unknown event. Some events as the exhibition of Veronica’s Veil had a big impact on the medieval imaginary, but we know a handful of depictions of this artefact that justify his popularity. Nothing of this in the Shroud’s case. The first wide depictions and representations of the Shroud were known in the 16th century.

This is to say, nil, zero, null.“And BTW, you contradicts yourself in your statements”.“By the way”, not, because the word “explanation” has a diverse sense in both cases I mentioned. 1.When a particular occurrence is a cause (or determinant condition) of another particular occurrence. This is the model of explanation in natural sciences. A determinate event a under determinate laws and circumstances determines the occurrence of b.2.In History (of Art) a particular event is explained when it is coherent with a model or frame. In this case, other alternative were possible in the same circumstances. The model M (a style, for example) determines that a particular occurrence α is not compatible and tends to disappear. But M is compatible with  a, b, or others. And so, the actual occurrence of a can be explained.All we can say in our issue is that the solution of the three nails was coherent with a change of composition typical of the pass from the Romanesque (tectonic) to the Gothic (a-tectonic).

We know that at the time of the memorandum the exhibition of the shroud had been banned because we have the request of Geoffroy II and the papal bull that suspends the ban.4. We know there were some claims that the shroud was a fake and had been painted. Because such a thing is clear from the letter from the king to his Bailly. See also Liège’s affair below.5. We know that the pope does not considered true the shroud, since the last bull says it can not be displayed as such.6. We do not know the private reasons of one and all. They are private. D’Arcis could act out of envy or honesty. The Pope could act out of conviction or political calculation. You don’t know anything about the personal opinion of Clement VII. You only know the personal opinions of the popes that expressed them. The public opinion is other thing.7. Marguerite could act out of greed or because he believed he had a subjective right over the shroud.8.

It might be thought presumptive of her husband Humbert to sign a document agreeing to return it. After his demise, she clearly asserted what she considered her rights of ownership”.Humbert de la Roche, Marguerite’s husband, represented her in 1418. What he signed was in her name and it commited her. Marguerite was directly sued by the canons of Lirey in 1443 (Dôle), 1447 (Besançon) and 1449 (Troyes). It don’t matter what were her claims but what the Court’s sentences were. She committed herself before the Courts to return the Shroud to canons of Lirey in three years and paid an economic compensation. She never kept her word. She was objectively a crook and a liar.Secondly: your interpretation is biased by your prejudices. You seem to think that all the people who affirm that the Shroud is a fake are immoral and malicious (Chevalier, Thurston, d’Arcis, etc.), and the people that think (according you) that the Shroud is authentic is well-meaning and honest. “No imaginative screen-play is required to interpret that intent, D’Arcis wanted it for his own cathedral!  Despite the royal signature, it is quite likely the king never saw nor noticed it, but it was merely in a sheaf of routine papers for his signature.”You make a pure speculation. You don’t know if the idea to carry the shroud to Troyes was suggested by d’Arcis, the king’s counsellors or the same king. You don’t realize that the same thing can be speculated about the papal bulls in opposite direction. Maybe the king thought that carrying the false shroud to Troyes was the simplest way to avoid its exhibition. Maybe d’Arcis was honest in trying to avoid the exhibition, maybe not. These are useless speculations. Pure melodrama. “Despite all the assertions that the cloth was painted, we now know that the cloth was never painted, was never touched by any paint-brush, nor ever near any artist’s palette, notwithstanding recent specious hypotheses”.“We know”? You think. I don’t know if the shroud was originally painted. I know that this was stated several times in the first years.

You can see this without sophisticated equipment or complex mathematical calculations.1. Let us suppose that the Shroud was supported by the body as Jumper, Jackson or Latendresse imagine. The fabric weight would make some parts, small or large, would adhere to the skin, producing zones of distance 0 and, therefore, intense coloration. In addition, the cloth should present some wrinkles well visible when it would be extended. This is so even in Latendresse’s forcibly reconstruction where the fabric is unnaturally stretched out.None of these things are visible in the image of the shroud. Or it is impossible the shorud was laying on the corpse or the 3D theory is false.  2. Let us suppose that the Shroud was flat (an additional mysterious force is needed, but this is not the topic here). Some parts of the body would be farther than 5cm. from the fabric (calves and abdomen, for example) and would be invisible. Or the Shroud was not flat or the 3D theory is impossible.

Radiation or vapour there was once an orthogonal (vertical) projection from body to image.2. Different colour intensities are produced by distance between body and cloth. 5 cm is the standard distance at which the image disappears (sindonist say). “3D information could not have been captured by some kind of radiation that is projected onto a sheet.” That’s what I think, for reasons given above.But the 3D information could not have been caused by some kind of contact with the shroud, because large deformations would be visible.Then we have just an alternative: Or the Shroud was manufactured with a process we don’t exactly know (paint or heating or some degradation due to time) or we are in front a miracle. About miracles you can see what I think in my blog (if you read Spanish or you have a good translator on line): Here: http://sombraenelsudario.wordpress.com/2013/01/17/milagro/ , and here http://sombraenelsudario.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/que-es-un-milagro/ and following entries.

The Shroud is not a photo. In photos the volume is obtained by light gradation. Photos usually are done with more than a single focus. This implies some kind of lateral shadow and chiaroscuro. The volume of the Shroud is represented by the colour intensity in terms of a closeness or distance to an imaginary plane. There are different concepts. Perhaps a good photographer could obtain a similar effect with a central focus and sieving light. Some painted images are lately done with similar results to the Shroud. Differences were due to the best or worse artistic skill of the painters. 2. Mr. Schumacher is a good scientist, I don’t doubt this. But to compare the Shroud with a Leonardo’s drawing, as I have seen he did in a documentary, is a great absurd. It is a monumental conceptual mistake.

Neither Jehoash Tablet nor Tutankhamen mummy can be “discredited”. In any case you can discredit a theory about an object as the tablet authenticity or the mummy malediction are. I think I’ve refuted (not “discredited”) some theories about the shroud, but the shroud is for me a mysterious object worthy of study yet.The images you have put here have nothing to do with my criticism. I don’t see on them the wrinkles that are clearly visible in Latendresse’s and Jackson’s simulations. For example, the wrinkles between nose and chest in Latendresse’s photo. Neither the contact areas of the fabric that I pointed out are visible.Your diagrams are absolutely idealistic and not realistic simulations. They need ulterior explanation and correction but I suppose that the red oval is the head and the blue line is the shroud. I don’t know in what orientation. Both in the simulations of Jackson and Latendresse the head is laying on the ground. So the head and the cloth would be in full contact and a big area coloured must be appearing in the image. Obviously it doesn’t occur.Instead of stylized diagrams, the attempt should be made with a real head. So we would see clearly the deformations produced by stretching the fabric (see ulterior comment). They inevitably are produced when the fabric is not flat and then is stretched. So, just the image 1 is credible, vertical projection (i.e. orthogonal) but with the shroud flat. But other problems will arise for this alternative that I have stated in my previous comment.If the distances required for the image was vanished are lower than 5 cm my objection is reinforced. I have read some Latendresse’s papers and I haven’t seen any explanation to my objections. I think he cannot do it.

This is not the case now.I again agree with Raymond Rogers: “We don’t know how” is not sufficient evidence for miracle claims. Only a feature of the Shroud is actually mysterious: superficiality of image. An interesting approach has been done by Luigi Garlaschelli, but he acknowledges that it is not definitive. (http://luigigarlaschelli.wix.com/luigigarlaschelli#!sindone-/c1n58 ).I think that the unique way to solve this problem (if possible) is an interdisciplinary independent team working on the Shroud. Art historians, chemists, textile experts and scientific archaeologists between others must compound this team. Absolute independence for churches, sindonologists, anti-sindonologists, sceptics and so on!A failure is not disposable. Finally, science cannot answer about all of everything and we don’t need claim miracles when this happens.About distortions of images:This http://www.pensar.org/images/shroudfig6.jpg or this http://sindone.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/2/0/1220953/8859260.jpg . This is what occurs when you stretched out a cloth that was wrapping a body. A bas relief is different. You can also take references on a body and reworking on the cloth with these references. This is Garlaschelli’s way. The Shroud is similar to a photo in that is a frontal view of a body. Yes. Similar three-dimensional images can be done with frontal photos. You have done a good work Hugh. But I continue thinking that a professional photographer would obtain better performances with frontal light. And a good realistic painter, of course (as Andrea di Buonaiuto called “Da Firenze”, for instance). Colinsberry: My opinion about your hypothesis has little value for I’m not familiar with chemistry and physics. What you say seems to me hypothetically feasible. But… hypotheses are not evidences. Some additional historical involvements should be studied.  For instance: you can obtain an image very similar to the Shroud by using opaque glasses… but it is uncertain that these big glasses could be made in the Middle Ages.","date":"November 6, 2013 at 3:51 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/11/03/should-we-be-reassessing-the-vp-8-results-continues-previous-post/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Should we be reassessing the VP-8 results (Continues Previous Post)"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"McCrone was wrong (or it seems to me).

See here a short report in English: https://sites.google.com/site/luigigarlaschelli/shroudreproduction .

A serious work would take high definition microphotographs of the different replicas of the Shroud (Garlaschelli, Broch, Pesce,Craig and Breese, etc.) and would match them with similar others from the Shroud. But this it would be a serious work and not an amateur one with photoshop.I understand even less why he analyses the common pictures of a coin scratched with a pencil.

The faces of Veronica circulating in the fourteenth Century were only painted portraits. Here the artist was more original.

Then he imagines invert the tones of a portrait in which the volume does not depend on the stray light, but making with darker shades the parts closest to the fabric and making clearer the farthest ones. Note that the same idea would be used in the Jumper and Jackson interpretation, obviously with another different conclusion. I have performed the same experiment taking a Renaissance portrait and it has turned this:  http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/21/bonaiuti3ampliadocopia.jpg/ .

(p. 2)“The Fourier transform has been around for a long time and is well suited for varietyof signal processing tasks, but capturing the local information of brushstrokes seemsto be outside of its reach”. (p. 4)  C. Robert Jacobsen: “Digital Painting Analysis”In reality the works you referred use other technics than Fourier transform, as is explained here: “In early days of image processing the Fourier transform was often used to decompose images into signals. In more recent years wavelets and transforms using wavelets have become more popular, as they can provide all the features of a Fourier transform, but also provide localised time information, as well as localised frequency information”. (p. 4?) Alexander David Brown: “Digital Analysis of Paintings”.Furthermore, all of them use more sophisticated devices than a simple scanner and photoshop, including infrared rays:“Our data set consisted of fifteen details of Goswin van der Weyden paintings, with the corresponding infrared reectograms of their underdrawings, as shown in Figures 7.1 through 7.15. The underdrawings were uncovered using infrared reectography technology.”  (Josephine Wolff: “Wavelet Analysis of Paintings by Goswin van der Weyden and Paul Gauguin”).The most interesting is “The Eye of the Painter: Deciphering Art Mathematically”. This article shows the limits of the mathematical methods in identifying works of art. It says about the theme of the brush strokes and directionality specifically: “To further prove the usefulness of the wavelet technique in identifying the originality of paintings it was decided to set up a new validation experiment that would be monitored entirely,without intermediaries and without any additional technical complexities. Charlotte Caspers would make seven pairs of paintings using different canvases, brushes and even styles. In eachpair there would be one original (always a still life) and one copy, made afterwards. Both would be painted by Caspers, yet, remarkably, it took her half more time to make the copy than to make the original painting.It turned out that where Caspers used soft brushes, no positive conclusions could be drawn”. (Bold letters are mine).That is to say. Unlike your amateur job:-The works that you referred used more complex methods, related to infrared rays, wavelets transform (Discrete or Complex), high resolution microphotographs, etc.-Some limitations to these methods, specially in the detection of  brush strokes, are detected. Brush strokes, as Charles pointed in other commentary, aren’t detectable when the paint is fluid (tempera, watercolour or diluted oil) or when a soft tool (brush, pad-ink or similar) is used. This is why your “presentation”, and those you recommended, are useless for the item we are discussing.  But the practice of recommending some texts that one has not read as supportive referenes is worse and it is often easily detected. Or perhaps you have read them but you have not understood their negative implications. I don’t know what problem you have, so I will refrain from more comments.","date":"November 14, 2014 at 2:52 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/11/why-the-images-and-bloodstains-were-not-painted-on/","cat":"guest_posting","title":"Why the images and bloodstains were not painted on"}],"misc":[{"author":"david_mo","post":"Carlos:Professor López-Amo makes the same mistake than Diane Fulbright (and similar to Mr. Tyrer also): techniques to weave wool are not techniques to weave linen.

The main sense of fraus, fraudis is guile, fraud or deceit.So, the fraud or guile which is mentioned in D’Arcis’ memorandum and the different versions of papal bulls (all in the same terms) is to present the Shroud as the true Shroud of Our Lord. The Pope explicitly disavows this.The Liege’s episode (1449) confirms the straightforward interpretation: the inauthenticity of the Shroud was presupposed in the papal bull. This is what the commission created by the bishop concludes on the basis of a direct exam and the checking of the papal bull in power of Marguerite de Charny.

Because…One: Physicalism isn’t a scientific theory. It is a philosophical theory. (They actually are several different theories).  So it can’t be based on “scientific evidence”. Intuition, coherence, praxis, probability or another else are good or bad arguments about physicalism, not “scientific evidence”. Two: Adam Zeman suspects that some sense of religion is the cause of the attacks against physicalism. He believes religion is wrong at this point, i.e., metaphysics-physical relations or translations to physical concepts from mental ones. You can say that someone is wrong while you love this person. So I think Mr. Bulkeley is wrong in supposing that disagree implies some form of antipathy.  I have no kind of antipathy for  Mr. Bulkeley. Three: I have an intuition. I think Mr. Bulkeley is wrong because he has a strong religious feeling or similar. He erroneously believes that when someone criticizes his beliefs is attacking his person.

Some examples:Christ teacher fresco, Ipogeo degli Aureli, Rome, 3th century,http://www.nisandbyzantium.org.rs/doc/zbornik6/PDF-VI/09%20Tamara.pdfSanta Prudenziana, Roma, 4th century (el Cristo es antiguo; retoques en los apóstoles) Sarcophage, Christ enseignant, Musée du Louvre, Fin du IVe siècle après J.-C. Santa Constanza, Roma: Cristo entregando la ley a Moisés, mitad del siglo IVhttp://jeannetifft.photoshelter.com/image/I0000g0Z4nD61yN8 Christ Between Peter and Paul, 4th century, Catacomb of Saints Marcellinus and Peter on the Via Labicana, Mural de la catacumba de Comodilla, finales del siglo IV.http://contemporaneoshistoriadelarte3.blogspot.com.es/ I can not verify the links. I am travelling and I have not many time. The same for translations. In any case, the representation of bearded Christ existed long before the Byzantine iconography of Pantocrator and the Mandylion. Christ represented as bearded philosopher/teacher was an image borrowed from pagan iconography.","date":"December 26, 2015 at 6:03 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/12/15/thank-you-everyone/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Thank You, Everyone"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"But here it will be a big hole for those who care about the shroud.(Oh my God!

La peinture n’y est pas si forte ni les traits si distinguez que le Suaire de Turin. C’est ce qui a fait dire à ceux qui ont donné l’histoire de l’un & de l’autre, que celui de Turin avoit servi à envelopper le corps tout ensanglanté à la descente de la croix, & que celui de Besançon avoit servi à l’ensevelir après qu’il eut été lavé & embaumé. Ce qu’il y a d’incommode pour cette opinion, c’est que l’on a observé la même fixation des membres dans l’une et l’autre peinture, jusqu’à lui croiser les mains et lui couvrir les reins de la même manière”.This is my translation of  Baillet’s text:“The other Shroud that also has an imprint of the body of Jesus Christ on is the one called the Shroud of Besancon. The painting is not so strong nor the features as definite as the Shroud of Turin. This is why those who made the history of the one and the other, have said that the Turin Shroud had been used to wrap the bloody body at the descent from the cross, and that of Besançon had been used to bury him after he was washed and embalmed. This opinion has an inconvenient because one can see the same fixing of the members in one and another painting, until crossing his hands and cover his kidneys in the same way”.(It can be absolutely improved. Sure!)I found interesting this paragraph because is another testimony that says that the image was clearly visible in the beginning of the 18th century. It is obvious that Baillet collects an opinion in his epoch: the Shroud was painted. And no more.Baillet has reason in that two different objects with different functions cannot support the same image. The bag theory is impossible. If you wrap a bloody corpse in a sheet or similar and then carry it for a long or a short distance a rubbing would be produced and the stains would be blurred. The net imprinting of blood as in the Shroud would be impossible. This is one of the Zugibe’s critics to Barbet and one of the bases of his theory of the post-washed imprinting.

This sequence, without ulterior explanations, implies the linen used to wrap the body was used as a shroud (perhaps not a final one).Only Luke speaks about a linen (singular) used to wrap the body first, and some funerary clothes (in plural) that Peter found in the empty tomb, after.We can draw any conclusion from this series of incoherent descriptions. One, two clothes, bandages, one sheet and a sudarium… But in the imaginary of painters that reproduced the story of the Shroud (Della Rovere and Clovio, over all of them), the stuff was clear. Some people are wrapping the body at the foot of the cross and it is a unavoidable conclusion that this was the cloth which was used also to bury the body because it has the same and inimitable form of the Shroud. Therefore, one sheet.  My previous objection was against this interpretation (“the bag”, in Collin’s words). This is the usual interpretation of the sindonists, except Zugibe and his supporters.

You have said that “God” is incomprehensible to the human mind.(“ It is nice to see that we have such moral authorities knowing better than God from His throne what is good and what is bad, what is “extreme”, and what is “moderate” evil in the cosmic perspective…”) I agree. It is incomprehensible for moralists, for me and for you. But if you say that you can assert something about “God” (“God exists”, “God is good”, “God is omniscient”, etc.), you are an irrationalist. There is not a logical problem with irrationalism, but it is an open door to the wishful thinking and its effects on History have been often disastrous. NOTE: It is not only “moral authorities” that think so. Every normal human being thinks that spiting in the neighbour’ soup is a qualitatively different evil to kill a child.","date":"January 11, 2015 at 3:49 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/01/again-does-god-exist/","cat":"science_and_religion","title":"Again:  Does God Exist?"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"It is funny!

You cannot explain the contradiction of God and evil. You only repeat that it could be different for the divine wisdom but you have not any evidence nor comprehension of how this alleged “infinite wisdom” can work. You cannot give a single evidence or indication about the five alternatives I put above. This is not my ignorance, but human “ignorance” that cannot solve the problem. ”And we don’t need to understand fully some entity to state something about it. We don’t fully understand star evolution, or functioning of living cells, yet we can state something about those matters.”I have explained you this fallacy. I will do it again: Men can know that there is a problem and to know also that they can solve it or not. Human beings do not know “fully” a lot of things. But it is impossible to do any assert about the exact subject that they ignore. If you ignore a particular circumstance of the living cells you cannot assert anything on this particular circumstance. A scientist never will do any assert about the previous second to the Big Bang. When we are in front of a factual problem we can do a hypothesis and search a way of contrast it with facts. But the problem of contradiction between God and evil is different because it implies facts and logic. Facts: the existence of sufferings. Logic: contradiction between good and evil. We have no means to test any hypothetical solution. Suppositions  are all the theologists can do. “May be”, “is possible that”, “perhaps”… I repeat you: I have put here five possible solutions to the problem of evil and God.

I will try to explain my position.1. I am not scientist. I can not to check out the scientific reliability of some sindonist statements, by Adler or Rogers, for example. I let this matter to more qualified persons here as Colin, Hugh and others.2. But I can see some scientific features from the perspective of the sociology and the philosophy of science. Both not too much sophisticated, of course.3. From this outlook I consider that a concept becomes scientific when is widely used by the scientific community. More specially, when it is integrated in a theoretical corpus with practical implications. This is the unique way to contrast its evidence.4. Some sindonists claim that they have successfully used some innovative technics in certain areas with huge implications. Adler and Heller on detecting ancient blood, Rogers or Fanti on some methods to date ancient textile (vaniline and mechanical), and so on.5. If they were truly scientific these methods and its theoretical basis, they would be widely discussed and used by the scientific community in specialised books, congresses and papers. If it would be so, we had a wide series of experiments on their bases. This would allow us, the non-specialist people, to asses if these theories would be scientific or not.6. The sindonists’ revolutionary methods are absolutely overlooked by the scientific community. Their theories had a marginal presence in a handful of peer reviewed journals and no more. Despite of its potential importance they hadn’t had any effect on the Archaeometry of the last fifty years.7. This is why they cannot be considered as “scientific” from  my point of view. (“Pseudoscientific” needs an ulterior explanation).8. I have applied this scheme to the historical field that I know better.9. If scientifically confirmed, the existence of a more or less miraculous shroud of Jesus would be the radical importance to the problem of the “historical Jesus”. It would be expected that some of the believer historians mentioned it in the context of their debate against the mythicists.10. This is not the case. I don’t know any reference in the work of the most relevant historians or exegetes, neither contemporary nor in the past.

It is usually considered the less historical of the gospels. But in some points it seems more exact that the other four gospels. As in the case of burial cloths, for example. The author of John speaks of othonia. This word is usually translated by “bandages” or “strips”. It is plural. This coincides with the archaeological data. The Jews buried the corpses wrapped with several pieces of cloth tied with strips, as in Akeldama example.

The evidence shows that the image came after the blood stains and I proceeded to logically demonstrate how this could be devastating to the position that holds forgery or artistry as the cause.Thank you. Your answer is clear. I think the bloodstains nature is not the main problem with them. My objection is maintained even if it was shown that the bloodstains are actually blood.The main question arises in other terms: Independently of their nature, are the bloodstains natural or painted? The subject was presented by “a leading forensic pathologist (Michael Baden, deputy chief medical examiner of New York for Suffolk County) [who] says(…) «Blood never oozes in nice neat rivulets, it gets clotted in the hair. The anatomic accuracy is more what Michelangelo would have done in a painting than what actually happens to a body».” (Cfr: Marvin M. Mueller, reply to William Meacham “The Authentication of the Turin Shroud: An Issue in Archaeological Epistemology”, http://www.shroud.com/meacham2.htm ). The reply came by hands of several sindonists. The referential work for all them is G. Lavoie. I shall comment his “Turin Shroud: a medical forensic study of its blood marks and image”, (http://www.acheiropoietos.info/proceedings/LavoieWeb.pdf). Lavoie accept the starting point (namely, drops of blood can’t flow over the hair), but he found an ingenious answer: the bloodstains do not really flowed over the hair. The blood drops were done by contact with the cloth when it wrapped the body. Later the linen became plane and the body prints on it by another different way. It is necessary to superpose the two images for an accurate location of marks. So, the bloodstains don’t flow over the hair, but on the face. This reply is widely accepted by sindonists (Fanti et allia). Do you agree with Mr.Lavoie? Or have you another way to explain the anomalous blood trails over the hair?","date":"June 15, 2012 at 9:44 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2012/06/12/quote-for-today-lombattis-shout-down-from-the-ivory-tower/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Quote for Today: Lombatti’s Shout Down from the Ivory Tower"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Someone can close italics?

In actuality his book is all the more powerful for this. First because any potential hostile scholars – and there certainly are some – can hardly accuse the author of twisting his translations to suit a pro-Shroud argument if the Shroud goes unmentioned.” This is a modern version of two truths strategy: there is a truth for “adherents” and there is a truth for “hostile scholars”. In the first case you can twist your translations. In the second case you must be “objective”. But I think Wilson doesn’t actually think the hostile scholars are “some”.

This would be the first step. (But not the last, of course).But the Fanti’s proposal touches surrealism when he imposes some particular conditions that sound more like obstacles than proposals. The Vatican has asked long time ago that if somebody had got a sample from the Shroud he should return it to the rightful owner, i.e. the same Vatican. Nobody answered. And now, Professor Fanti declares he has a piece of the Shroud but it will not go out of his office.

We have already spoken in this forum about the Zugibe’s refutation of Barbet’s claims. I copy here some remarks about the fantastic “respiratory gymnastics” that, according Barbet, the crucified man had to do for breathing.“Experiment One demonstrates that the position on the cross of our volunteers corresponds to the sagging position hypothesized by Barbet and that it is not physically possible to straighten from Barbet’s sagging position. This appears to be due to the fact that with both feet secured to the stipes or with one foot on top of the other and the knees bent , the range of motion limitation for straightening has been exceeded which precludes any type of straightening or pushing mechanism. It is also obvious that it would be virtually impossible to straighten the body from the sagging position since the arms of the crucarius were so far extended. This experiment also demonstrates that if volunteers who were in good physical condition were unable to push or pull up to straighten themselves no matter how hard they tried when the feet are secured to the stipes or with one foot on top of the other, how could an injured, exhausted person particularly one in severe pain and nailed through the hands and feet have the strength to straighten from a sagging position. This should completely repudiate the theory of straightening and sagging as proposed by Barbet. Therefore, it doesn’t matter how long the crucarius was on the cross and in what physical condition he was in, because it is not possible to straighten as proposed by Barbet and even if it were possible, there would be no reason to straighten because simply stated, there is no problem breathing in the sagging position (…)Another fact to mull over is that the average respiratory rate is 12 to 16 per minute and in the scenario proposed by Barbet, the crucarius would have had to straighten himself by pushing against the nails in excess of 360 times during the 6 hours on the cross even if he took only about one respiration per minute”.Frederick T. Zugibe: “EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES IN CRUCIFIXION: INTRODUCTION”, http://www.crucifixion-shroud.com/experimental_studies_in_crucifix.htm Conclusion: The subtle brushed of the median nerve imagined by Barbet is impossible in the very conditions imagined by him. Nothing “irrebatible”, Carlos. But, once again, I advertise that this debate can be interesting from the point of view of forensic medicine but it is absolutely irrelevant to the matter of the authenticity of the Shroud. The medieval painters used to represent the crossed hands with the thumbs hidden. Dan Porter was kind enough to put one of my comments with pictures in this forum.

I only know his book that is a mixture of scientific experiences and religious exaltation.I suppose that Zugibe did not repeat the experiences of Barbet for some technical reasons and because he considered that he needn’t to do this: he affirms that the median nerve is not placed in the position that Barbet had supposed.“The missing thumb on the Shroud was due to injury to the median nerve by the passage of the nail. Barbet indicated that each time the nail was driven through Destot’s space, the median nerve was severed either halfway or two-thirds of the way causing the thumb to be drawn into the palm. This of course is untenable because as we demonstrated above, the median nerve does not pass through Destot’s space but runs along the opposite side (thumb or radial side) of the wrist. Even if the median nerve was injured causing, mechanical stimulation as Barbet claimed, this would still not cause the thumb to be drawn into the palm of the hand. Dr. Ernest Lampe, one of world’s leading hand surgeons who in discussing injuries to the median nerve, relates in his book, Surgical Anatomy of the Hand, that in severance of the median nerve…… “THERE IS INABILITY TO FLEX THE THUMB, INDEX AND MIDDLE FINGERS”. This was confirmed to me by several hand reconstruction surgeons.” (PIERRE BARBET REVISITED, http://www.crucifixion-shroud.com/Barbet.htm )NOTE: “Technical reasons”: it is not easier to play the Frankenstein game in our times as in the Barbet’s times.","date":"August 1, 2015 at 3:42 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"« J’ai fait l’expérience sur un avant-bras d’homme adulte, en fendant complètement l’espace radiocubital : le point inférieur où le clou s’arrête entre les deux os est à cinq centirnètres au-dessus du pli de flexion du poignet.

They spoke of the bright colour of the blood (as painted) and then mention some visible features of the body. So, we mustn’t demand for an explicit mention of the coloured body, but for a mention to the faded aspect of it. And we have no reference of it!The sindonist fellows of this forum are subtly inverting the proceeding with a typically incorrect sindonist way of thinking. “He said there was a dog. He didn’t say the dog wasn’t green. Then, the dog was probably green”. A fallacy.What we ought to questioning is why the early testimonies spoke about some features that now are invisible. The five wounds of the body, for example. This raises a problem and two possible answers: -The witnesses don’t say what they are actually seeing but what they remember or think they are seeing… In sum, they are not reliable.– In the early times of his wandering in Europe the shroud was retouched. I think very difficult to discern which of the two answers is more plausible. Perhaps a mixture.","date":"November 8, 2014 at 2:35 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Trace: Copy (a drawing, map, or design) by drawing over its lines on a superimposed piece of transparent paper.Yes,","date":"November 8, 2014 at 3:10 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Collins concise:Trace: a mark or other sign that something has been in a place; vestige,Yes.","date":"November 8, 2014 at 3:13 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/11/04/a-couple-of-terrific-comments-about-charles-freemans-article/","cat":"article","title":"A Couple of Terrific Comments About Charles Freeman’s Article"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"I don’t know what do you men with “in the context of the Shroud”, but I can imagine it.I’m sorry but the main meaning of “trace” doesn’t implies any “faint”.

As other medieval shrouds have been disappeared, we have not the possibility to make a comparative study. We can say it is different from other Holy Faces we know, Manoppello included, that are simple portraits. But we make a big mistake if, as Wessellow does, we compare it with the usual medieval art.

Have you read both the Poulle’s article and the Chevalier’s writings?I have them in my bookcase and I think Poulle’s critic is biased and fails his target. I translate here a paragraph from my blog (http://sombraenelsudario.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/la-aparicion-del-sudario/):In 2006 the historian and archivist Emmanuel Poulle made a very harsh criticism against Ulysse Chevalier, which sometimes falls into the insult. According to him, the renowned historian and canon had wilfully misrepresented the terms of the documentation in hiding the latest papal bulls (…). Without entering into the assessment of the deletions and other issues of documentary importance, we must recognize that Poulle’s position is not entirely consistent. Indeed, the same Chevalier in its 1903 text answer to similar allegations against him and highlights that you cannot question his honesty because he included the text of Jean of Naples’ correction [definitive redaction] (“Autour des origines du suaire de Lirey”, Paris, Alphonse Picard et Fils,  1903, p. 36, doc. K, in Latin). Moreover, he insists that this final document, though softened, is still conclusive about the lack of authenticity of the linen.I have to add to this:M. Poulle surely is an honest man, but his rabid attack against M. Chevalier ignores two relevant facts. First, although the final text of the papal bull omitted the expression “painted image” and similar still maintained it was a “figure or representation” and demanded that it be said out loud when exhibited “to avoid any fraud”. And it banned the paraphernalia that usually accompanied the exhibition of the accepted relics. Secondly, M. Poulle forgot that the investigation ordered by the bishop of Liege in 1449 confirmed the existence of this papal bull and accordingly ruled that the relic was not genuine but painted. So we have to conclude that was M. Poulle who made some unfortunate omissions.","date":"October 21, 2014 at 3:54 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/10/17/a-significant-article-by-charles-freeman-in-history-today/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"A Significant Article by Charles Freeman in History Today"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"Henrik said: ““In it was painted, in a subtle way, the double portrait of a man”Memorandom of Pierre de Arcis, 1389The issue is not whether some thought the image was painted but rather if it always has been considered to be subtle.

The clue is some words ignored by Poulle: omni fraude cessante, i.e. to avoid any fraud. If the last bull imposes some conditions to the ostension (the Srhoud of Lirey is not shown as the authentic Shroud, no candles, etc.), it is in order to avoid any fraud. And what is the only fraud thinkable in this case? Obviously one: to show the sheet as the authentic shroud of the Christ.

There is not a single reason why the evangelists have to conceal the existence of this marvellous legacy of their Lord, the Holly Shroud. There is not a single reason why the cloth continued to be an “arcanus” with the triumph of Christian Empire when other legends, such as Abgar’s episode, were widely widespread and a multitude of relics arose from beneath the stones. There is not a single reason why this marvellous relic was not registered in the inventory of the relics when the chapel of Lirey was consecrated. The Papal bulls of Clemente VII implied a pre-existent document from Bishop d’Arcis in similar terms to the copy that Chevalier discovered.

Let us come back to the facts.The facts are the statements that we can substantiate on the basis of the documents that are preserved. And you are right. We have several documents about the founding of the Lirey’s collegiate. One of them is the confirmation by the Bishop Henry de Poitiers. It is a laudatory text and, you are right, there is not any disapproval of the public ostensions of the Shroud, but… nor is there any reference to the Shroud or its exhibitions. As in the other documents. The most direct explanation for this is that the shroud wasn’t in Lirey at this time or it wasn’t considered a relic. This is also consistent with  d’Arcis’ claims that the upset of Henry de Poitiers was due to the public exhibition of the Shroud as an authentic relic. And it would be unthinkable that the public exhibitions of the Shroud were known by Henry without any mention to it either laudatory or condemnatory. And this is also consistent with the lack of mention to the Shroud in the list of relics when the foundation of the chapel.  “Of the paint that he claims was so cunningly applied by his unknown artist, there remains not a vestige. If Bishop Henri ever discovered the secret of the image as alleged, then he imparted it to no-one, nor was it known to his successor Bishop D’Arcis, nor has anyone else since ever discovered this marvelous secret”.Perhaps there was not any “secret”.

The matrimonial policy in the Middle Ages was a very complex matter that had nothing to do with “effusive” or “cordial” feelings. Or was he satisfied with the suspension of exhibitions after his interdiction  (cf. d’Arcis)?  You continue with your TV series. But your characters are too anachronistic. Do you like the Sopranos?If the praised of the merits of the Lirey’s chapel by Henri de Poitier was so “effusive” (sic) why he doesn’t dedicate one single word to such great relic as the Shroud was and its multitudinous  (d’Arcy dixit)  exhibitions? Only two possibilities: or the Shroud was not in Lirey or it was not considered a relic and there weren’t any exhibition in 1356. The first possibility points to a forgery made by the monks of Lirey.

Chevalier didn’t hold accountable of the last version in the corpus of his writting “en renvoyant à l’apparat critique les additions marginales…”. This is not correct because in the p. 13 Chevalier affirms: “On aurait pu reconnaître avec quelle loyauté scrupuleuse j’ai donné les variantes de la seconde édition, qui atténuaient un peu les expressions très défavorables de la première à l’authenticité. On ne fera jamais dire à cette bulle, même amendée, que le Suaire dont il y est question fût l’original. Il y reste ces mots topiques :Figuram seu  representationem non ostendunt ut verum Sudarium D.

In fact, you don’t challenge my definition. You just said that a non-expert can be more competent than an expert in some circumstances. I agree, but we ought to specify in what circumstances or “context” if you like.2.For example: A practical problem is different from a theoretical one. You cannot match a mechanical problem with a physical or a historical problem. In the first case the expertise is highly dependent of experience. Aristotle spoke of technical and scientific issues. The terminology is ancient but the concept is still valid. But this is my first condition: a wide experience. Our problem is a historical problem and in History this wide experience is checked by years of study and production in specialist literature. In mechanics the checking is not the same, obviously. Perhaps we can speak of experience in the garage and success in the manipulation of objects. I don’t know because I am not an expert in this matter.3.Of course, a non-expert can be right in a particular issue. Exceptions are possible. We have to examine all the particular circumstances and the reasoning involved. But the non-expert would claim his success not his expertise.

Fanti’s imagination makes him see things. About Fulbright: Bad historical practice is made when you compare different objects from separate cultures and try to match them. Fulbright might demonstrate that a cloth as the Shroud is physically possible in Palestina in the 1st. Century. Maybe. But physical possibility isn’t cultural (and economic) possibility. A burial cloth from a poor prophet in Jerusalem isn’t a royal burial cloth in the Chalcolithic (6.000 years before!) or in North Europe (900 BCE). Burial cloths aren’t coats, wool isn’t linen, 2:2 isn’t 3:1, and so on. It sounds alike to the inexpert, but this way of comparison can mislead him. The true historians know this. I think Mrs. Fulbright has forgotten it. I recommend take a look at “La Sindone e il giudaismo al tempo di Gesù” by Antonio Lombatti, http://www.cicap.org/new/stampa.php?id=273770# . Very intesting.

It was said to be a common practice of 1st century Jews to provide extravagant funerals. This practice only ceased in the 2nd century when Gamaliel II directed that he was to be buried in a simple plain-weave shroud, and his example then became the norm.1. How many linen shrouds about 4m long has found Mrs. Fulbright in Palestine into the “extravagant” tombs of rich Jews?2. How many of these linen was woven in herringbone tread 3:1 twisted in “Z”?Yes, nothing, or almost nothing, is impossible in History. But the Shroud of Turin doesn’t match withh funeral clothes in Palestine (1st Century), and Mrs. Fulbright’s article doesn’t changes this claim.Joseph of Arimathea is a controversial character in the narrative of the Passion with contradictory features. Let us talk the first evangelist, that is to say, Mark (15:42-46):“[42] And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,[43] Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.[44] And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.[45] And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.[46] And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.”Normal. The “honourable counseller” has voted against Jesus in the strange Sanhedrin session, but he is a secret disciple of Jesus. So, when he knows Jesus is dead he goes to the local market and buys a royal linen cloth (very common in Palestina markets in these days) just before the Sabbath begins.All is normal… in a fairy tale. Note that I’m not denying JA could exist and that he could buy a piece of linen. I’m asserting that an improvisation of the purchase of so exceptional piece of linen is highly unlikely (i.e.: “impossible”).Shroud of Turin is supposed to be a proof of evangelical narrative, not the other way around. If we accept the Gospels as an argument for the Shroud case we don’t make History, but stories.","date":"April 19, 2013 at 2:06 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2013/04/16/giulio-fanti-responds-to-gian-marco-rinaldis-book-review/","cat":"books","title":"Giulio Fanti Responds to Gian Marco Rinaldi’s Book Review"},{"author":"david_mo","post":"This is very ugly, Mario.Firstly, you have taken advantage of the work of another person without mention him.

I’ve been looking for a proof or an indication that this famous million was a reward for “having proven the Shroud to be a forgery” and I have found nothing. I have read several Mr. Marino’s pronouncements in this sense and I have not found anything similar to proof or indication. To blame someone without any proof is a very nasty thing. “And, of course, we know that the British Museum’s Dr. Michael Tite, who was billed as the independent overseer of the 1988 C-14 dating, left the museum and took the place of the late Dr. Edward (Teddy) Hall, when he resigned shortly after the dating and after the lab had received the donation.”Mr. Tite was keeper of the British Museum Research Laboratory. He was perfectly qualified to hold any academic position. His task in Radiocarbon dating of Turin Shroud was just supervision. He did not take any disposition without Holy See’s approval (Card. Ballestrero and advisors). The letter he sends to Card. Ballestrero about the true meaning of the dating (no proof or fake) is an exquisite sample of neutrality. His alleged lack of objectivity is just a presumption without any solid basis. To blame someone without any proof is a very nasty thing. Mr. Marino’s position about alleged complot in radiocarbon dating, specifically rejected by more serious sindonoligsts as Ian Wilson, Raymond Rogers or John Jackson, don’t surprise me, for I have read fom Mr. Marino some paragraphs as this one: “The age of the Shroud given by the labs was 663 +/-25 years, which includes 666.”(“The Disciples On The Road To Turin”.

He is the leader of Counter-Catholic Reformation, a religious-political fundamentalist movement. His charges against almost all participants in the 1988 dating match his peculiar beliefs. I can have unfounded suspicions about sexual life of Pope Francesco. It would be a funny matter to cheat with friends in front a cup of wine or two. If I publish my unfounded suspicions the things are not funny at all. You the “conspirationalists” don’t realize that if you invalidate the 1988 dating because alleged (non evident) sceptical or freemasons (?) beliefs of some participants, you must invalidate all the sindonologists’ work (your own work also) because your opposite beliefs.
