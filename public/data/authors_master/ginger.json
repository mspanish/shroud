{"art":[{"author":"ginger","post":"I have read “Heaven is For Real”, and also have shared several books with friends and family.  I will forever be grateful to Colton and his dad for sharing this with us. It is as if someone opened a curtain to allow us a glimpse of heaven.   I also appreciate their sharing Akiane’s “Prince of Peace”.  This painting is priceless.  We are the first generation in 2000 years to know what Christ looked like!  \nI found this site about 4 hours ago and am still reading.  However, I needed to skip to the bottom to address something that is disturbing a number of writers:  Akiane’s apparent drifting from the Christian faith.  We need to remember that she was only 8 years old when she painted this picture, and God was allowing this innocent child to see visions of heaven that most of us will not see until we die.  She is now a teenager, and has been subjected to all the notoriety of the rich and famous.  Being famous changes most people, as does growing up.  She may no longer be having visions of heaven; she is probably having visions of huge bank accounts, noting how much her original art and the prints are selling for.  In this realm, she will probably paint what she thinks the public at large wants and will buy.  The general public will no doubt be willing to pay far more for her non- religious art than most Christians will pay for her religious art.  At this time in her life it appears that worldly things have over powered spiritual things.  We need to pray for her.\nRegarding The Shroud of Turin”:  the one thing that bothers me is where the front top of the head meets the top back of the head.  There is no evidence showing where the TOP of the head should be.  It shows a round front LINE touching a round back LINE.  If this piece of cloth wrapped over the top of anyone’s head, there should be an area about 5″ long by 3″ – 4″ wide between the front of the head and the back.  The  ‘picture’ should flow smoothly from front to back.  There would not be a distinct line outlining the face and another outlining  the back of the head.  It  would have a faded, irregular edge as the cloth over the face and head would have laid in folds over the rounded head.  (Lay a cloth over a ball to see what I am referring to.)  Until someone can explain why there is no top of Jesus’ head on this cloth, I will not believe this cloth ever touched Jesus’ body. Also, the ‘picture’ of the face should not appear to have been drawn on a flat surface as it appears on this shroud.  It should have irregularities as it would have laid in folds (as over a ball).  The whole ‘picture ‘ appears to have been drawn on a flat surface rather than on a 3 dimensional surface.  I am not a scientist, but I am an artist, and this picture has no 3rd dimension to it that I can see.\n\n","date":"April 21, 2012 at 1:09 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
