As I age I see the many Blessings God bestowed on me for which I did not dutifully did not Thank Him. I Pray my heart is true for Him, even though my mind gets out of whack at times. I Pray also for the world which has fallen from grace,  Continue to Pray and read and I will Pray you find PEACE. Sometime Prayer a simple heartfelt honest Prayer will ease a troubled heart and mind\n\n","date":"October 15, 2012 at 1:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
