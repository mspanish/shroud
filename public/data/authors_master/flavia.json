{"forensic":[{"author":"flavia","post":"Dear Professor Nicolotti, I would be very interested in having some clear references showing that the objects that I saw at the Vatican Museums are not flagra; in fact, they are classified as ‘bronze flagra’ (see the article of Dr. Claudia Lega, which I quoted in my paper), and none of the archaeologist that I met at the Museum proposed the hypothesis that the objects that we were observig (that are preserved in the store) are not flagra. If you give me some reference, I could certainly try to clarify the matter. If you like, you can write me an e-mail at flavia.manservigi@gmail.com. Thank you very much, hope to hear of you soon!\n\n","date":"March 4, 2015 at 4:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/a-number-of-marks-falling-all-over-the-surface-of-the-body/","cat":"history","title":"A number of marks falling all over the surface of the body"},{"author":"flavia","post":"Dear Professor Nicolotti, I’m afraid I did not receive any answer to my question about the references concerning the ‘bronze flagra’ of the Vatican Museums; I would be very interested in having some clearer and more precise indications about this matter, in order to be able to clarify if there were any misunderstandings.
