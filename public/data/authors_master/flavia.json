If you give me some reference, I could certainly try to clarify the matter. If you like, you can write me an e mail at flavia.manservigi@gmail.com. Thank you very much, hope to hear of you soon!.","date":"2015-03-04","mins":"4:23 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/18/a-number-of-marks-falling-all-over-the-surface-of-the-body/","cat":"history","title":"A number of marks falling all over the surface of the body"},{"id":"comment-195871","author":"flavia","post":"Dear Professor Nicolotti, I’m afraid I did not receive any answer to my question about the references concerning the ‘bronze flagra’ of the Vatican Museums; I would be very interested in having some clearer and more precise indications about this matter, in order to be able to clarify if there were any misunderstandings.
