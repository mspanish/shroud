I have to say your theory is very convincing, and main point, you achieved to reproduce very similar artefacts to TS like no one did before. So warm congrats!!I’m not sure if this is the right place to post the following question:According to the gospels, Jesus was anointed few days before his death by Marie Magdala. So here we have one of the ingredients you use for imprinting and image on a linen cloth. The gospels don’t mention any flour, and we would not see why Jesus would have flour all over his body like you do to recreate the image on linen. Nevertheless, knowing the conditions of Jesus walk to Golgotha, we can imagine that he has been in contact with dust all over his body (for e.g. falling down, possibly people throwing him dust, wind, or during body put down the cross, or whatever). My question is: could judean fine dust be a possible replacement for flour to make a body print on linen shroud? Would it have similar properties, as fine particles?I’m not trying to defend shroud authenticity here, just investigate! I’m fine with TS being a forgery, but still ok to give a chance to TS authenticity!Thanks for your scientific answer. And excuse my english, I’m french!Matthieu","date":"August 11, 2016 at 11:35 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: “Shroud of Turin – and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic) science”"},{"author":"matthieu_lefebvre","post":"Hi Collin,Glad my comment helped your google referencing, though when I googled shroud and I can’t remember the other keyword, it came almost first in first page.Well, to answer to you, the main reasons I’m not hundred percent sure the TS is a forgery is the quality of the artwork, that respond exactly to all aspects that we could scientifically expect for a crucified man that had a crown of thorns on his head. If TS is a forgery, then the forger is a really a genius, and a scientific, and a forensic, and a scholar, and a torturer. It means he invented a printing technique not known before and after him (until you arrived), had to make a lot of testing like you do, he had to torture and crucify a bearded man with long hair, did it with nails in the wrists although all artistic depiction in his time and in the past have always been in the hands (I’m very skeptical the forger used a sculpture for the imprint, due to the blood stains that are very subtle and in the right physiological layout).Making such a forgery with no mistakes, with the means and knowledge of middle ages is very impressive (to me). But why not, if the C14 says so.On the other hand, I wonder if TS is not the Mandylion? What is your opinion about it?But anyway. I am now still wondering if your model works only with flour or also with any powder material? If you prefer the question turned this way, could Geoffoi de Charny or his forger used only flour, or dust, or pigments, or talc, or else?","date":"August 13, 2016 at 11:01 pm","url":"https://shroudofturinwithoutallthehype.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/shroud-of-turin-and-now-for-a-retrospective-look-at-the-boring-old-systematic-science/","cat":"uncategorized","title":"Final posting in previous stodgy site format: “Shroud of Turin – and now for a retrospective look at the boring old (systematic) science”"}]}
