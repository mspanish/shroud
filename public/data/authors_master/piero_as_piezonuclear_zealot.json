The material used for the tests was Green Luserna granite. Since the analyzed material contains iron, our conjecture was that piezonuclear fission reactions involving fission of iron into aluminum, and of iron into magnesium and silicon, should have occurred during compression damage and failure. It is also interesting to emphasize that the present natural abundances of aluminum (~8%), and silicon (28%) and scarcity of iron (~4%) in the continental Earth’s crust should be possibly due to the piezonuclear fission reactions considered above.And then, see also :Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s CrustA.

Abstract>Piezonuclear reactions, which occur in inert and non-radioactiveelements, are induced by high pressure and, in particular, bybrittle fracture phenomena in solids under compression. Theselow-energy reactions generally take place in nuclei with anatomic weight that is lower or equal to that of iron (Fe). Theexperimental evidence, obtained from repeatable measurementsof neutron emissions [Strain 45, 2009, 332; Strain (in press);Phys. Lett. A. 373, 2009, 4158], can be also recognisedconsidering the anomalous chemical balances of the majorevents that have affected the Earth’s crust, oceans andatmosphere, over the last 4 billion years. These anomaliesinclude (i) abrupt variations in the most abundant elementsin correspondence with the formation of tectonic plates;(ii) the ‘Great Oxidation Event’ (2.7–2.4 billion years ago),with a sharp increase in atmospheric oxygen and thesubsequent origin of life; (iii) the current climate accelerationpartially because of ‘carbon pollution’. Natural piezonuclearreactions are induced by fault sliding and plate subduction phenomena.Here another title :Reply to “Comments on ‘Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s Crust’  by  A. Carpinteri and A. Manuello”  by  U. Bardi and G. ComorettoIt was the answer by Alberto Carpinteri and Amedeo Manuello …Abstract>In the paper entitled “Comments on ‘Geomechanical and Geochemical Evidence of Piezonuclear Fission Reactions in the Earth’s Crust’ by A. Carpinteri and Manuello” by U. Bardi and G. Comoretto, the authors criticise the hypothesis based on piezonuclear reactions for the interpretation of the compositional evolution of the Earth’s crust. We report a detailed reply of how the traditional theories, used by the authors of the comments, are obviously inadequate to describe this new kind of nuclear phenomena. Only very recently, independent authors proposed a theoretical model explaining the anomalous energy emissions in the form of neutrons, involved in piezonuclear reactions, during fracture of nonradioactive rocks. It is also known how the evidences that Bardi and Comoretto claim to be non-existent could be found in many independent works that appeared in most important journals about unexplained questions of the Earth’s crust and environment. The data reported in the original work and the details included in this reply show that it is incorrect to consider impossible or simply to ignore the existence of unexplained phenomena only because they cannot be described by traditional models and conventional theories.Link :http://www.researchgate.net/publication/259556161_Reply_to_Comments_on_Geomechanical_and_Geochemical_Evidence_of_Piezonuclear_Fission_Reactions_in_the_Earth%27s_Crust_by_A._Carpinteri_and_A._Manuello_by_U._Bardi_and_G._ComorettoUnfortunately, until now, I have not yet see the useof SSNTD (= solid state nuclear track detector) duringthe experiments … or the AFM images of stones beforeand after piezonuclear reactions …Carpinteri used only FESEM = Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope.Link :http://staff.polito.it/alberto.carpinteri/papers/CARPINTERI_2012_N.683_EM.pdfSee at p. 11 of 21 (= FESEM for quantitative elemental analyses) and see also at p. 13 (of 21).Then, here the possible title about the inherent study :Atomic force microscopy study of several stone surfaces, before and after piezonuclear reactions.But we have to investigate two ideas1) that neutron emissions from an ancient earthquake that rocked Jerusalem could have created the iconic image,2) … and messed up the radiocarbon levels …","date":"April 24, 2014 at 8:47 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/04/24/ridiculous-quote-for-today/","cat":"quotations","title":"Ridiculous Quote for Today"}]}
