{"dating":[{"author":"matt_k","post":"The BBC documentary from a few years back had a good demonstration of how the marks on the shroud correspond to folds of how it may have been lifted up mechanically in Constantinople. And there are the art studies showing how the shroud shares characteristics with Eastern icons going back to the 7th century at least.  With the Hungarian Pray ms. and the document found in the Vatican archives a few years back, there is strong historical evidence that the shroud, or something that looked just like it, was around much earlier than 1260.\n\n","date":"March 20, 2015 at 9:12 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/20/john-klotz-delivers-the-knockout/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"John Klotz Delivers the Knockout"},{"author":"matt_k","post":"If flagellation marks suddenly appear in art around 1300, they could easily be attributed to the influence of the shroud itself on the art of the day.  It is well documented that the shroud has influenced artistic images of Christ as long as it has been around.  Several of the popular books have documentation of this.  If a 13th century artist created the marks on the shroud, he researched the topic well enough to perfectly match the historical shape and size of the Roman flagrum. We have no evidence how this bit of history was known before modern times. It is also begging the question of how such an image was made in the 13th century.\n\n","date":"March 9, 2015 at 10:42 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/03/08/a-rebuttal-of-jacksons-refutation-of-reweaving/","cat":"carbon_14_dating","title":"A Rebuttal of Jackson’s Refutation of Reweaving?"}],"image":[{"author":"matt_k","post":"I like to see honest discussion of the evidence going on here.  I agree C. Berry’s ideas are worth continued investigation.  And the concept of the cloth being treated with some agent to affect the scorching process is also worthy of further study.  I grow frustrated with all the claims of “this has been proved” or “that’s been debunked” or “I’ve cracked it!”. That is not the language of serious science. As Ray Rogers himself said, “I don’t believe in miracles that defy the laws of nature”.  While we are free to disagree with Rogers here, seeking the truth wherever it may lead is the only way forward.\n\n","date":"March 19, 2014 at 8:21 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/14/two-comments-promoted-colin-berry-has-cracked-the-shroud-enigma/","cat":"image_theory","title":"Two Comments Promoted:  Colin Berry Has Cracked the Shroud Enigma?"}],"key_evidence":[{"author":"matt_k","post":"The sum total of the evidence is much more important to me than any one factor.
