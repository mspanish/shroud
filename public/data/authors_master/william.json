God demonstrated this by giving the Law. The Law reveals our sinful nature so that we turn away from self righteousness and turn to Jesus for salvation.Rom 3:28For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Rom 5:13To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law. Rom 3:20Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. Gal 2:16know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in  Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. Gal 3:11Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.” So you see, it is by grace we are saved through faith, in Jesus, not a cloth.","date":"April 20, 2015 at 12:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"author":"william","post":"Sampath, all one needs to do is read the biblical account from the eyewitnesses. the description of the burial clothes of Jesus is nothing like the shroud. That is all the investigation I need.You ask if Jesus ever said we need faith?Jhn 3:18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. Note that Jesus says whoever believes, not whoever does good works. In fact, even if you have good works, if you do not believe, then you still are condemned.Jhn 3:36Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them. Again the only qualification is that you believe, if you do not believe then all the good works in the world cannot save you, according to Jesus. Jhn 5:24“Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. No where does Jesus say that works will save you. As for the parable of the goats and the sheep.Mat 7:21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Note that he says only the one that has done the will of my Father. What is the will of God?Jhn 6:28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” Jhn 6:29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” It is clear, Jesus did tell us that we are to believe in Him, and that by believing we are saved.But Jesus also warned us of false prophets AND false messiahs:Mat 24:24For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. There are many different Christs presented to the world, but only one can save you.Where does your faith come from, the testimony of God or a piece of cloth that has nothing to do with Jesus.","date":"April 20, 2015 at 9:18 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"author":"william","post":"Sampath, no one is saved by faith, they are saved by grace through faith.Eph 2:8For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— I know you do not believe Paul but how can I go read the bible like you suggest and not read Paul. He wrote 2/3rds of the New Testament. If you do not believe Paul, then why believe anything? Paul is called the apostle to the Gentiles. Please note that unlike your assertion that I am unaware what the bible says, you never quote the bible. Why should anyone believe anything you say? You are not arguing with me, you are calling God a liar.You said that Jesus never said we are saved by faith, yet I gave you several verses quoting Jesus directly where He said that if we BELIEVE we are saved. If you disagree, then why don’t you quote the bible where Jesus says we are saved by works?By the way, I did not say the shroud was a false prophet, I merely pointed out that Jesus warned us about false prophets as well as false messiahs. Jesus is the true messiah and yet the image on the cloth looks nothing like the description of Jesus given through the prophet Isaiah.Isa 53:2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
