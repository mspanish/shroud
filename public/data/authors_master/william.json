Whereas the Akiane painting is CLEARLY a Mercury Saturn body type. There are 7 BASIC body types, six of which merge into the one following in a never altering pattern. The seventh type can merge with ANY of the others. The idea of seven basic body types was one of the plot devices of a well known fairy tale, collected centuries ago by the Brothers Grimm. That story is Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Additionally, the names of these types, which correspond to the planets and heavenly bodies that name the days of the week are words that are already IN OUR LINGO. For example, there are Martial arts, a Mercurial disposition, a Jovial fellow, a Saturnine countenance, etc. Etc. Billy Crudup, Timothy Dalton, John Cusack are Mercury Saturn types. Whereas Clint Eastwood, Sam Elliot and Brett Cullen are pure Saturn types. Interestingly, Leonardo Da Vinci, based on his self portrait cartoon is clearly a Mars Jovial type. How those two cuckoo clocks could have thought a Mars Jovial looked like a Saturn is one for the ages..","date":"2011-03-19","mins":"1:40 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}],"researchers":[{"id":"comment-196751","author":"william","post":"Well here is the literal translation.

Is your belief in the shroud the only source of belief in Jesus you have? Are you concerned that if the shroud were not authentic then you would no longer believe in Jesus? Do you believe in Jesus? I am familiar with the Word of God and I know what it means. 1 Co 2:14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit I understand that tradition is very hard to break, but sometimes it is necessary. Mar 7:13 Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.” God tells us that we are saved through faith in him that cannot be seen. Heb 11:1 Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Heb 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please God… God loves you and it is His will that you are saved but you must believe the Truth. Jhn 8:31 …“If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Jhn 8:32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” But I suppose you’ll say all of these verses are translated improperly.

God demonstrated this by giving the Law. The Law reveals our sinful nature so that we turn away from self righteousness and turn to Jesus for salvation. Rom 3:28 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law. Rom 5:13 To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law. Rom 3:20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin. Gal 2:16 know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. Gal 3:11 Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.” So you see, it is by grace we are saved through faith, in Jesus, not a cloth..","date":"2015-04-20","mins":"12:01 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/04/02/alan-whanger-vs-hugh-farey-on-premier-christian-radio/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"Alan Whanger vs Hugh Farey on Premier Christian Radio"},{"id":"comment-196920","author":"william","post":"Sampath, all one needs to do is read the biblical account from the eyewitnesses. The description of the burial clothes of Jesus is nothing like the shroud. That is all the investigation I need. You ask if Jesus ever said we need faith? Jhn 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. Note that Jesus says whoever believes, not whoever does good works. In fact, even if you have good works, if you do not believe, then you still are condemned. Jhn 3:36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them. Again the only qualification is that you believe, if you do not believe then all the good works in the world cannot save you, according to Jesus. Jhn 5:24 “Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. No where does Jesus say that works will save you. As for the parable of the goats and the sheep. Mat 7:21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Note that he says only the one that has done the will of my Father. What is the will of God? Jhn 6:28 Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” Jhn 6:29 Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.” It is clear, Jesus did tell us that we are to believe in Him, and that by believing we are saved. But Jesus also warned us of false prophets AND false messiahs: Mat 24:24 For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. There are many different Christs presented to the world, but only one can save you.

Please note that unlike your assertion that I am unaware what the bible says, you never quote the bible. Why should anyone believe anything you say? You are not arguing with me, you are calling God a liar. You said that Jesus never said we are saved by faith, yet I gave you several verses quoting Jesus directly where He said that if we BELIEVE we are saved. If you disagree, then why don’t you quote the bible where Jesus says we are saved by works? By the way, I did not say the shroud was a false prophet, I merely pointed out that Jesus warned us about false prophets as well as false messiahs. Jesus is the true messiah and yet the image on the cloth looks nothing like the description of Jesus given through the prophet Isaiah. Isa 53:2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. Notice that Isaiah says that Jesus has no beauty or majesty and that nothing in his appearance would cause us to desire him. The image on the shroud looks like a king straight out of Camelot.
