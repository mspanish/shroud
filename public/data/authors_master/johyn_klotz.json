There is no other burial cloth with such an image. While I have not  made an exhaustive study, blood stained cloths on a murder victims are probably not a singular item. All the stains do is indicate that  he bled and the extent of his torture. That’s not unique.\nIt’s the image that is a specific witness to the crucifixion, and circumstantial evidence of the resurrection. Given its unique characteristics and superficiality, there is no other such image.\nSkeptics, please cite an existing image and not a hypothetical one. The shroud is not a hypothetical object.\n\n","date":"March 21, 2014 at 8:27 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/21/so-then-why-is-there-an-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"So then, why is there an image?"},{"author":"johyn_klotz","post":"You betcha\n\n","date":"March 22, 2014 at 8:39 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/21/so-then-why-is-there-an-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"So then, why is there an image?"},{"author":"johyn_klotz","post":"I have been avoiding this discussion because of my work on my project. However, Hugh seems to be suggesting that creases may have been “ironed” out. Oy Veh! Not even Mechtilde would have done  something so dense.  Maybe they sent it out to a local laundry. Or perhaps a fancy “French Cleaners” for dry cleaning, Do they have French Cleaners in Turin?\nThe concept that anyone with custody of the Shroud would have taken an iron to it to remove creases beggars the imagination. And Colin Berry is doing more kitchen science experiments to prove something?? Really??\nI have to leave right now. Trying to shape up my narration of the “first” but not “original sin”. Anybody want to guess what it is?\n\n","date":"March 22, 2014 at 5:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/03/21/so-then-why-is-there-an-image/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"So then, why is there an image?"}]}
