{"art":[{"id":"comment-4551","author":"janette","post":"Just finished reading Heaven is for real. I can believe this book and these pictures painted as the bible comments that “in the last days, young men will dream dreams and old men will have visions and he will pour out his spirit.” So then I came to look for the picture of Jesus, after the book. I think the picture could be right, but if it isn’t, does it really matter in the grand scheme of things? It is nice to picture the person you are praying about and to, whether the person be dead or alive. (and some people need that). If we picture this Jesus when we pray, I am sure it won’t really matter if when we get to heaven, he doesn’t look like that. Remember our parents and grandparents will not look like they did on earth, if they died in their old age. So we will have alot to adapt to. Although I believe it will all be completely natural for us. After reading negative comments about the picture of “The First” I was expecting something sordid and expected to be shocked. After seeing it, all I saw was pure total innocence, Stunning!! Remember your first innocent love? or maybe it wasn’t innocent for you, or perhaps you feel guilty about something? Not sure why people think as they do, perhaps this world has also distorted our image of pureness too much! About the pictures of Hindus in this work, I think someone mentioned. God needs to reach all people. Perhaps that picture will peek someones interest from another religion and Christ will reach them that way, We don’t know. “God makes a way where there seems to be no way.” ” All things work to the good of those who love the Lord,” even when it doesn’t look like it. About the shroud, it is immaterial!! (pun intended.) If people think it is real maybe it is, if they don’t maybe it isn’t. Only God knows some things, for sure!.","date":"2011-11-04","mins":"5:07 am","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2011/02/23/akianes-jesus-heaven-is-for-real-and-the-man-in-the-turin-shroud/","cat":"akiane_kramarik","title":"Akiane’s Jesus, Heaven is for Real and the Man in the Turin Shroud"}]}
