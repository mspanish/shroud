I also agree that the the 3 D information in the image is one good reason to believe that the 1988 Carbon Dating is incorrect – but it is not sufficient. There are better reasons why the CD is incorrect. Getting back to CB’s scorch theory – it would be better to use a term better than scorch. Scorch is too vague. Not specific. Not scientific. Any transfer of energy to linen could be considered a scorch. The notion of a heated cruficix with linen overlayed – giving this image – seems so crude. Max P.H. Rightly observed the CB would have needed to have “pressed” the linen against the heated crucifix. Many of us probably remember helping our mothers do the ironing when we were younger. That hot iron – and the scorch – on dad’s shirt or on the pillow case – varied dramatically not only with the heat and time of exposure but also to the pressure applied. I applaud CB’s theories but wish he would considere more scientific – and more elaborate causes of scorches. Daily, I work with lasers – femto, argon, yag, excimer, etc. As a physician and an opthalmolgist I have always been intrigued by the shroud image and have wondered if it was created by an intense burst of light energy. We know to create an image on the outermost fibrils of the linen – a very sophisticated transfer of energy is necessary. Heat – in the thermal range – as an exlpanation of the scorch is ridiculous. There is indeed – 3 D information on the shroud – simply because we can perceive a 3 D image. The distance of the shroud from the linen – adds an interesting theory as to the embedding of the 3 D information – but understanding how the image – and discoloration – of the outer fibrils – was established seems to take primacy. The monochromatic nature of image and its superficiality points us in a different direction from a thermal scorch or some chemical reaction.

I learned this in a lecture at my alma mater – Notre Dame. There are other kinds of contractures – such as a trigger finger or Dupuytren’s contracture. This has been debated at length and we had this discussion in gross anatomy lab in medical school. It is well understood that injury to a nerve can cause contractures. Every joint has flexors and extenders. If the extensor muscles are weakened by an injury to the nerve – the contracting muscles will have no resistance – causing continuous contraction. The other curious issue to me is that it has almost always been the custom to place the deceased person’s hands/arms crossed over one’s chest or one’s abdomen. Look at King Tut’s sarcophagus. Or for that matter – any of the people with crypts in any cathedral in Europe. Hands are folded – over the chest – never the pubic area. So here comes the Shroud with hands covering the pubic area. This would not be what a forger would try to do – if he was indeed trying to replicate the standard burial customs. It is also fortunate that the hands are indeed covering the private parts of the Crucified One. We would not – nor would God the Father, Son or Holy Spirit want us to be talking about Jesus” private parts. So too, if the thumbs were not contracted – but folded – over the pubic area – it could easily be misconstrued that the thumb sticking up was actually not the thumb. Rather something else. Not good for discourse. The obvious reasons for a physician to see the Shroud as authentic is because of all the other forensic detail on the Shroud. Very fine detail that is easily overlooked. As an eye surgeon I have also a strong interest in the neuro cognitive sciences – particularly in regards to reading. It is rather obvious that from this stand point – the shroud was produced outside the normal precepts or visual perception. First and foremost is that fact that the Shroud is indeed a negative image. Perhaps not a perfect photographical negative – but a negative nonetheless. Secondly, the size/scale of the image is such that the artist would need to have produced the image – standing at least 6 feet from the cloth – this according to Barry S. And his background in photography. This would be nearly impossible. Thirdly, the image does have 3 D qualities. Perhaps not totally understood yet. But beyond the 3 D nature of the Shroud is the fact that there is the quality of “linear perspective” in the image of the Shroud. You can perceive how the legs are bent. You can see the hollow of the back. It is obvious to see how gravity affected blood flow. This is different than 3 D. Yet we also know the linear perspective was not introduced accurately until Giotto with his frescoes during the Renaissance. Professor Freeman may want to talk about this. It is his area of expertise I expect. Even the carbon dating predates the introduction of linear perspective. The Shroud is not the construct of an artist. As for how the brain reconstructs the image in the brain – that is a long and drawn out discussion. Suffice it to say – the brain can best perceive the image of the Shroud from a distance. The actual image – up close – does comply with normal neuro processing. I suspect something is in play regarding contrast sensitivity..","date":"2015-07-29","mins":"3:09 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/07/28/comment-promoted-colin-berry-on-robert-bucklin/","cat":"science","title":"Comment Promoted:  Colin Berry on Robert Bucklin"},{"id":"comment-206911","author":"stan_walker_md","post":"Daveb, I cannot disagree with Barbet. His analysis is the best I have read. No one can know if this finding is due to trauma to the muscles or the nerve. Another possibility is that the nails put the flexor muscle/tendon on stretch causing this contracture. We know from the scripture that the guard lanced the side of Jesus after he was already dead. How long had he been dead – minutes, hours? And by the time Joseph of Arimathea got permission to take the body of Christ down it was likely hours – that is plural – after his death. Rigor mortis sets in about two to six hours after death. Earlier in the heat. When I did my training at the Mayo Clinic the ophthalmology residents were responsible for harvesting the eyes for transplantation. I believe it is only the eyes and the marrow that are taken after death. The other organs are harvested before the heart stops beating. We were called to the morgue to enucleate the eyes anywhere from 2 6 hours post mortem. It was apparent to me that rigor mortis had clearly set in in almost every case. The small muscles are affected first – eyelids, jaws, facial muscles, fingers, toes. Large muscles last. It is certainly consistent that the thumbs on the Shroud would still be contracted at the time of burial. There is no reason they would become un contracted. The rigor mortis may have abated by the time the image was created but there would be no reason for the thumbs to straighten. On a side note, the Shroud has a serene quality to it. Very serene. This is a subjective observation. Nonetheless, I have read other opinions sharing this impression. Having enucleated many eyes and dissected a number of cadaver heads – I am still struck with the details on the Shroud.

One could argue this could be achieved in a sculpture used in the forgery of the shroud. Nonetheless, Jung apparently felt the image was speaking a truth to him. Or as philosopher Michael Polanyi would say, “We know more than we can tell.”.","date":"2015-01-14","mins":"1:06 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/14/papers-by-the-skeptic-of-sturp/","cat":"paper_chase","title":"Papers by the Skeptic of STURP"},{"id":"comment-182082","author":"stan_walker_md","post":"Personally, I like Colin Berry’s theory – the scorch theory – better. In this instance, Jesus is lying in the shroud thinking about how he just got crucificied by a bunch or knuckleheads from Rome and that Barabas rascal gets set free. Free! So He gets madder and madder – to the point where he is smokin hot. And poof! He scorches the shroud and gets resurrected. Don’t mess with Jesus..","date":"2015-01-08","mins":"4:35 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/08/an-early-morning-google-find/","cat":"video","title":"An Early Morning Google Find"},{"id":"comment-181376","author":"stan_walker_md","post":"Its Fantis!.","date":"2015-01-04","mins":"10:04 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/01/03/television-an-italian-professor-believes-he-has-the-answer/","cat":"video","title":"Television:  An Italian Professor believes he has the answer."},{"id":"comment-195600","author":"stan_walker_md","post":"Good golly, Miss Mollie.

I am struck that there is any pollen at all on the Shroud or the Sudarium. A forger from long ago would have no clue what a spore or pollen grain would be or where it came from. And it would never occur to him to posit such artifacts on the forgery. I am wondering if these spores are found randomly or sporadically (pun intended) on other pieces of linen from centuries ago. Charles Freeman who stated, ” They certainly provide better evidence (the other artifacts in the box) than this elusive pollen!”. Perhaps Charles could enlighten us on the incidence and prevalence of pollen grains on ancient pieces of art. Methinks no one is suggesting the Sudarium is a forgery. Just another inexplicable artifact. I cannot imagine a scenario that someone could discredit the presence of the pollen, its biological classification as being meaningless and also explain why there are pollen grains present at all..","date":"2015-02-15","mins":"9:24 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2015/02/15/important-new-pollen-discovery-on-the-sudarium-of-oviedo/","cat":"press_coverage","title":"Important New Pollen Discovery on the Sudarium of Oviedo?"}]}
