{"misc":[{"author":"wayfairer","post":"Josie, I do understand your emotional reaction upon looking at the Holy Face of Manpello. When I first downloaded it and looked at it I was quite discomfitted. The eyes seemed to be staring right through me, but I couldn’t tear myself away. I figured if I were truly gazing upon the face of Christ, who sees into my very soul, it should make me a bit uncomfortable. Still–how many different photos of the Face have you seen? The face looks quite different in various lights and angles. Aparently this is even more so when viewing the image itself, but even photos show striking differences in expression. There are scores of photos of the image available on the internet. In some he looks stern, in others peaceful. Even if you gaze at the Face for a significant time the expression changes subtly.\n\n","date":"August 12, 2015 at 3:44 pm","url":"https://shroudstory.com/2014/09/07/the-veil-of-manoppello-to-visit-the-philippines-this-month/","cat":"news_&_views","title":"The Veil of Manoppello to Visit the Philippines This Month"}]}
