Or rather Sir Kenneth Clark’s cent, as he said“… the average man had become progressively less able to recognize the subjects or understand the meaning of the works of art of the past.

It comes as a shock to an elderly man to find how many biblical references have become completely incomprehensible to the present generation.”(KC, introduction to”Dictionary of subjects and symbols in Art” by James Hall)The object is labelled a globe because a globe is the correct attribute for an image meant to depict Christ as the Salvator Mundi (Saviour of the World).
